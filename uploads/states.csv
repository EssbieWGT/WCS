The frustration is tied to apprehension about government spending as well as strings attached to federal grants. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A trio of Republican members on the Kansas State Board of Education shared frustration with routine acceptance of federal grants for education programs that include policy mandates contrary to political perspectives of many of their constituents.
During recent meetings of the state Board of Education, members Debby Potter of Garden Plain, Connie O’Brien of Tonganoxie and Michelle Dombrosky of Olathe shared objections to linking federal spending to policy.
Attorneys with the state Board of Education and Kansas State Department of Education warned the 10-member board to give careful consideration to votes on federal grants to avoid undermining operation of school districts statewide.
“If we just vote ‘no’ on money, then where does that leave us?” said state board chairperson Cathy Hopkins of Hays. “What is the plan?”
Dombrosky, who won election to the board in 2018 and reelection in 2022, said federal aid to schools was infected with ill-conceived mandates put in place by the administration of Democratic President Joe Biden. Objectionable ideas attached to education grants made it into books and other classroom resources, she said. Republican President Donald Trump is in the process of reversing Biden-era mandates, she said.
“A lot of parents went crazy over the curriculum that was coming into our school system,” she said. “Now, we have a new administration that’s in there that’s pulling these things back, because people voted for that. People wanted that out of there. They wanted it out of the school system.”
She said the state’s acceptance of federal aid placed local Kansas school districts in a quandary.
“Sounds to me like we’ve fostered a dependency on the federal money,” Dombrosky said. “If this money were to go away tomorrow, would it stand alone on merit?”
 
Culture change
O’Brien, a former member of the Kansas House who won election to the state board in 2024, said excessive spending across government and mounting debt at the federal level necessitated cuts in expenditures. She also expressed opposition to anchoring policy to federal grants.
“When I talk to people, they’re concerned about taxes,” she said. “At some point, we need to start reining in the spending part and we’re going to have to do it in education, health care, everything.”
Potter, also elected last year to the state board, has said obligations attached to federal grants sought to diminish the influence of parents who were responsible for deciding the type of education provided their children.
The federal government is an intrusion into the relationship between parents and teachers, she said.
Potter said she was eager to create an environment that restored public faith in the state Board of Education.
“I’m trying to change the culture, somewhat, of the board,” Potter said.
She said she wanted more information included in official minutes of monthly state board meetings so Kansans had a better idea what transpired and what was said on financial and policy matters.
“We have constituents that do not trust the administration, and the administration has not earned my trust either,” she said.
 
State obligations
Scott Gordon, general counsel to the Kansas State Department of Education, said most federally funded programs included measures intended to hold recipients accountable. Failure to comply could place the entirety of funding at risk, he said.
“Generally, there is an all-or-none approach to compliance,” Gordon said. “You don’t get to comply with 75% or 80% of the federal requirements and still get to keep all the money.”
For example, he said, on April 8 the state board voted on a motion to earmark $20,000 in federal funds to sponsor public service announcements with information about where children could receive free meals during summer months. The 5-5 tie vote was equivalent to rejection of the motion, which meant opponents Dombrosky, P0tter, O’Brien, Dennis Hershberger and Danny Zeck, all Republicans, were successful in blocking expenditure of those federal dollars to inform children and families.
That federal funding previously created a 1:3 match, meaning the $20,000 investment generated the equivalent of $60,000 in advertising in Kansas.
Gordon said the board’s vote on the $20,000 allocation was the type that theoretically could threaten Kansas’ free- and reduced-lunch program through the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The state Department of Education has the option of seeking an alternative funding source for promoting the summer food program, he said.
“It doesn’t just hurt the board or the department,” he said. “It hurts the people that are relying on that money.”
 
Due process
Mark Ferguson, who has provided legal counsel to the state Board of Education since 2009, said the recommendation wasn’t that board members should continue federal programs just because the state had done so for years.
“There’s not an expectation that you continue to just rubber stamp those things,” he said.
He urged the state Board of Education to work through funding or policy issues in a way that provided due process to recipients of those programs. Due process included notice to Kansans about potential changes and granted people an opportunity to share their views, he said.
He said the state board hadn’t previously incorporated the due process piece into decision making because, as a whole, actions of the state board on federal programs largely maintained the status quo. Change in the state board’s membership altered the dynamic sufficiently to warrant adoption of due process guidelines, he said.
“I would encourage the board, if making decisions that negatively impact others, to factor in due process,” Ferguson said. “Let’s not just vote ‘no’ and take that away. Let’s anticipate that decision, give notice to the public and get some input so that’s not just the rug being pulled out in the 11th hour.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Michelle-Dombrosky-2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-16 20:03:10.357634

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Utah’s rates on unemployment and job growth are surpassing national averages this year and the state has kept its top spot in economic outlook ranking. But, amid tariffs, and a dropping consumer sentiment, economists warn the state is entering risky waters.
The state’s economy is outperforming other states, with jobs growing 2.1%, almost doubling the 1.2% national average. Utah also has some of the lowest unemployment rates, 3.1%, while that number remained unchanged at 4.2% nationally, according to a report from the Utah Department of Workforce Services released on Friday.
“Labor market indicators remain robust, with broad job expansions across industries and a low unemployment rate,” Ben Crabb, chief economist with the department, said in a statement. “The level of job openings continues to exceed the number of unemployed workers in the state as employers promptly employ available labor.”

The top private sector industries adding jobs to the state are education and health services, followed by construction and manufacturing.
According to Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute data shared by Natalie Gochnour, the institute’s director, to the Salt Lake City Council on Tuesday, nearly half of the state’s jobs are in Salt Lake County, and 1 in 4 jobs are in Salt Lake City. “A stunning number when you think of the breadth of the state,” Gochnour said. That’s over 400,000 roles in the city. 
Immigration, housing and tariffs awake uncertainty in Utah’s 2025 economic outlook

“We’re in an elite economy nationwide, as a state, and the urban center is participating and contributing to the economic vibrancy of the state in a big way.”
Utah also led the nation in gross domestic product growth in 2024 with 4.5%, compared to a 2.8% national average, and earned other top spots in the country, including one of the highest household incomes with cost of living adjustments, and the lowest poverty rate. 
But a recession is possible
With this economic growth, whether a recession is coming is not apparent yet, Gochnour said. However, Utahns may still feel the impact of other economic national trends, and she believes it is for “self-inflicted” reasons, such as tariffs, which she described as “a tax on trade.”
“A reason many of the economists aren’t forecasting a recession right now is because as things start to look bad, the administration will change and come to the rescue,” Gochnour said. 
During the first term of the Trump administration, tariff rates went from 1% to 3%, which the Biden administration kept. Now, according to Moody’s Analytics calculations, the potential rate during President Donald Trump’s second term could climb to 11.5%. 



Let us know what you think...


 


Estimates predicting the future economics in the country have been uncertain this year and are constantly changing. But, the latest numbers, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the Gardner Institute and Wells Fargo Economics, indicate that there may be a recession during the last half of 2025, with the country’s gross domestic product falling 0.9% during the third quarter and 1.1% during the fourth quarter.
“Right now, the probability of a recession among most economists is somewhere in the 45% to 60% rate,” Gochnour said. “So, flip of a coin. We’ll see.”
What’s already happening, though, is the free fall of consumer sentiment in the country, an index used to measure how consumers view current and future economic conditions.
“And so you got a consumer that’s feeling a little funky, you’ve got businesses with a lot of uncertainty, so they’re not hiring, or they’re pausing, they’re not investing, and eventually that’s going to show up in the numbers,” she said. “This should be a leading indicator to all of us.”
Another fall felt in the state is a decline of job growth in leisure and hospitality. According to the Department of Workforce Services’ summary, that industry shrank by 400 jobs in the last year, the second-largest private sector decline after the trade, transportation and utilities industry, which experienced the loss of 2,300 jobs.
Gochnour attributes that to tempered international travel, an effect of federal policies, as well as cuts in national parks, with employee counts declining 13% only this year, among other causes. The forecast for international visitation as of March is a 9.4% decline, according to Tourism Economics, an Oxford Economics research company.
“This is something that’s expected and well known in the leisure and hospitality sector, that we’re going to feel some pain from that contraction,” she said. 
However, there will also be some other balancing forces, at least for Salt Lake City, with the opening of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints’ remodeled Temple Square in 2027, which is expected to attract millions of visitors.

(Photo provided by the Indiana Department of Correction)A federal judge will soon decide whether media should have guaranteed access to witness Indiana’s next execution, which is scheduled to take place just after midnight Tuesday.
During a Friday morning hearing in Evansville, in Indiana’s southern district, lawyers representing five news entities — including the Indiana Capital Chronicle — argued that a state law barring press from witnessing state executions violates the First Amendment.
The plaintiffs asked Judge Matthew Brookman to issue a preliminary injunction that would block the state law, for now, and ensure that journalists have access to the scheduled execution of death row inmate Benjamin Ritchie at the Indiana State Prison in Michigan City, as well as future executions during the pendency of the case.
News outlets seek to pause Indiana law barring journalists from witnessing executions

Up for debate, as well, is a Department of Correction (DOC) policy that says press “shall not be permitted to witness the execution.”
News reporters are granted access to a designated area outside of the Indiana State Prison but are not permitted to directly witness the state’s actions — unless invited by the condemned to fill one of the five spots.
The Indiana Attorney General’s Office pushed back, arguing that journalists have no constitutional right, or privilege, to witness executions.
Jeff Garn, representing the state, emphasized that any last-minute changes to add media to the upcoming execution’s witness lists would disrupt a “highly-coordinated” process that’s been rehearsed for months by DOC staff. 
He questioned, too, whether the state prison’s two designated execution chamber witness rooms can be modified — in a matter of days — to accommodate additional capacity.
The federal judge did not immediately rule on the preliminary injunction request but promised a “timely” decision.
Room for reporters
Attorneys with the Reporters Committee for the Freedom of the Press are representing the news entities, which include the Capital Chronicle, The Associated Press, Gannett, Circle City Broadcasting and TEGNA.
Lin Weeks, on behalf of the plaintiffs, maintained Friday that public access to executions is crucial for ensuring transparency and accountability as the state carries out “the most severe” punishment it can impose. Journalists, he said, serve as surrogates of the public.
“Public access ensures executions are competently and humanely administered,” Weeks told the court, adding that details, including any “missteps,” about such procedures “should be known to members of the public.”
“The public,” he continued, “needs to see justice carried out.”

Weeks said media-reported information is also of importance to other condemned inmates awaiting to be put to death. Ritchie and six other men are currently on death row at Indiana State Prison.
The news organizations’ underlying complaint centers on an Indiana law that limits attendance at executions to: the warden, a warden’s designated assistant, the prison physician, another physician, a spiritual advisor, a prison chaplain, five friends or relatives of the inmate and eight members of the victim’s family.
Weeks said the plaintiffs are seeking four witness spots specifically for reporters. Current law and DOC policy only allow 13 witnesses total.
Those four witnesses could be included in the 13 allowed currently, or additional spots could be added to one or both rooms that provide visibility into the execution chamber, Weeks told the judge.
He said the Capital Chronicle and other news outlets have requested spots on Ritchie’s witness list but have so far been denied.
Reporters from all five news entities have covered portions of the case and The Associated Press regularly covers executions nationwide.
Indiana is one of 27 states with the death penalty, but one of only two states — along with Wyoming — that doesn’t include media witnesses at executions.
Senior Reporter Casey Smith witnessed December’s state execution of Joseph Corcoran — via the inmate’s guest list.
Weeks also held that Indiana’s law treats the press more harshly than other members of the public. While victims’ families and a condemned person’s friends or clergy may attend, the media is explicitly barred unless a journalist is handpicked by the inmate.
He additionally pointed out that up to 10 journalists are allowed to observe federal executions conducted at the U.S. Penitentiary in Terre Haute. Closed-circuit television has also been available in the past for federal prison executions to be viewed outside the designated witness areas.  
State says request comes ‘too late’
Garn, however, argued that executions are not public events and that media have no inherent right to witness them. 
“They do not have a right to observe the execution,” Garn said, maintaining that executions differ from criminal trials, for example. “This is not a (public) proceeding. This is an operation, carrying out a sentence of an incarcerated person.”
He said it’s “unclear” how DOC staff would accommodate media if a short-notice injunction is granted.
“This case was brought too late for the execution scheduled on Tuesday,” Garn reiterated.

He emphasized that chairs in the execution chamber’s two witness rooms “are literally bolted to the floor,” leaving limited flexibility for additional observers.
He said the plaintiffs filed their primary injunction request “too late,” noting that the state requested an execution date for Ritchie in September, and a challenge to state law “should have been filed earlier.” The Indiana Supreme Court set the execution date April 15.
Indiana State Prison Warden Ron Neal, one of the defendants — and the only person to provide witness testimony before the court at the Friday hearing — also raised concerns about the confidentiality of execution team members.
“If the identities of those involved are not protected, I wouldn’t have a team,” the warden said.
Neal presided over Corcoran’s execution in December. Before that, he was involved in the 2009 state execution of Eric Wrinkles — the last death sentence to be carried out before Indiana’s 15-year execution hiatus.  
He said the execution room for the condemned holding five witnesses is “tight” and “very limited.” His court declaration said it was 10-by-10 feet.
Online descriptions of a 10-by-10 foot-storage unit say it is equivalent to a small bedroom or half of a one-car-garage.
The Capital Chronicle’s experience at the December execution found there were four chairs in the condemned witness room bolted to the two-levels of the riser. In addition, there were three empty chairs elsewhere in the room. Two guards also were in the room.
After an execution date is set, Neal said DOC staff practice the process at least once each week ahead of the execution date. 
Communication between the prison and offices of the governor and the attorney general are tested. An intravenous line is inserted “into a live (volunteer) every time” a training is held.
Staff are also taught the precise steps taken to escort witnesses to and from the execution chamber. Neal conceded, though, that “there’s always a possibility that folks don’t show up, and we plan accordingly.”










We take it very seriously … we don’t want to make any mistakes.


– Indiana State Prison Warden Ron Neal


All DOC employees involved in the process then participate in a full, step-by-step “dress rehearsal” the day before a scheduled execution, Neal said.
“We go to great lengths … just as we would on the day of an execution,” he told the court. “We take it very seriously … we don’t want to make any mistakes.”
Garn suggested the case could be more appropriately litigated after the current execution, and even mentioned a possible future settlement conference. 
Weeks, referencing Neal’s testimony, argued that DOC staff are trained “to handle flexibility in the number of people” who attend as witnesses.
The media attorney argued that DOC staff have accommodated changes to witness lists before — even in the days preceding an execution — and could still do so before Tuesday.
Gov. Mike Braun rejected a clemency plea from Ritchie on Wednesday, one day after the Indiana Parole Board recommended that the death row inmate’s upcoming execution proceed as scheduled.
Ritchie, who fatally shot Beech Grove law enforcement officer William Toney during a police pursuit on Sept. 29, 2000, had petitioned the board to commute his death sentence to life without parole.

Three bills passed in 2025 changing voter laws have been challenged in court. (Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)Two lawsuits challenging three different voter-related laws passed during the 2025 Legislative Session were filed this month in Montana district courts, pushing back against a suite of bills Republican legislators have said are essential to preserve the integrity of the state’s elections.
The Montana Federation of Public Employees on Monday filed a lawsuit alleging a bill repealing election-day registration, and a bill strengthening voter ID requirements, are unconstitutional, while the Montana Public Interest Research Group (MontPIRG) filed suit earlier this month against a bill that prevents college students from voting in a community unless they intend to stay there permanently. 
Gov. Greg Gianforte, a Republican, signed all three bills, which largely passed along partisan lines, into law. 
House Bill 413, introduced by Rep. Jane Gillette, R-Three Forks, changed the definition of residency in Montana code, stating that individuals cannot become residents, and therefore vote, in a county if they are there for “temporary work, training, or an educational program.” The bill includes a requirement that voters intend to make a county their permanent home following their temporary purpose in order to vote. 
MontPIRG, which represents nearly 28,000 students across the state, said the law effectively disenfranchises any college students who move to attend school. 
“HB 413 singles out these students and requires them to attest—under penalty of perjury—that they intend to make the county where they are studying their “permanent home at the conclusion of” their “educational program,” thus deterring and depriving many students of the ability to exercise their fundamental right to vote,” the complaint, filed in Missoula District Court, states. 
As an example, court documents say that a student from Sidney who moves to Missoula for college must predict where she will live after she graduates, and if she doesn’t commit to living in Missoula County, she “cannot register to vote there — the community where she lives works, volunteers, likely pays taxes, and studies.”
But, if that student drops out of school and gets a job in town, she can register to vote as long as she’s been in Montana for 30 days, “irrespective of her future plans.”
While speaking on the bill during the Legislature, Gillette said the bill was not aimed at students, but at temporary workers such as traveling nurses. She also said the bill was about intent — and someone living in a community for several years could still have the intention to leave and that should be taken into consideration before they can vote in that community. 
“By imposing special requirements that bar student voters from registering to vote in their communities, HB 413 violates the rights of suffrage and equal protection guaranteed by the Montana and U.S. Constitutions,” according to the complaint. 
The two bills challenged by MFPE in Lewis and Clark District Court were carried by Sen. Mike Cuffe, R-Eureka. 
Senate Bill 490 tightened the deadline for voters to register to vote to noon on the day of the election under the new law, and eliminates registration on the Monday before an election, but opens it up on the prior Saturday. 
Previously, anyone in line at the ballot box by 8 p.m. on Election Day could register to vote, which has occasionally led to long lines at voting locations. 
Last Election Day, some voters waited in line at the Gallatin County Courthouse until the early hours of the morning in order to register and cast their ballot. 
Cuffe, in an opinion piece published by Lee Newspapers, cited that example — when votes were cast as late as 4 a.m. — as a reason for passing his bill. 
“The intent is to smooth out the process and avoid votes being cast many hours beyond the intended closing of the polls at 8 a.m.,” Cuffe wrote. 
Both of the bills challenged, along with others Cuffe carried in the Legislature, were intended to bolster Montanans’ “confidence in the purity of our elections. That’s why I focused so much of my time on the issue,” Cuffe said.
Senate Bill 276 enacts photo identification voting in Montana, and expands the variety of ID options allowed to include tribal photo ID cards, military IDs, U.S. Passports, driver’s licenses and student ID cards. 
“Voter identification is a nonpartisan, commonsense best practice, and I’m pleased that the Montana Legislature agrees,” said Secretary of State Christi Jacobsen in a press release when the bill was sent to Gianforte. “Enacting these voter ID laws will streamline processes for election officials and provide a better election experience for Montana voters.”
The legal complaint from MFPE cites a Montana Supreme Court decision from 2024 that struck down a law passed in 2021 eliminating Election Day voter registration, and another that sought to narrow the list of acceptable photo IDs allowed, as evidence for why the new bills should fail. 
“These bills are plainly unconstitutional and clearly contravene the Supreme Court’s (decision),” according to court filings. “This Court must enjoin the Legislature’s attempted end-run around binding precedent and the voting rights of Montana citizens.”
Attorney Raph Graybill, a former Democratic candidate for Lieutenant Governor, is representing the plaintiffs in both cases. The Elias Law Group is also representing the plaintiffs.

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota will need a third more prison space than it has now by 2036, and lawmakers’ choice to pass a so-called truth in sentencing bill in 2023 is a major reason why.
That’s among the takeaways from a new report on the state’s prison infrastructure that says the state would need to spend between $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion on new prisons to deal with an inmate population that’s projected to swell in spite of the state’s decreasing crime rate. 
The state needs a 1,700-bed men’s prison immediately, the report from Arrington Watkins says. Even then, it says, another 1,500 beds for men will be necessary in a little more than 10 years, when it projects a prison population of more than 5,000 people. 
South Dakota corrections work group formally backs need for new prison

The state signed a $729,000 contract with the Phoenix-based firm as part of “Project Prison Reset,” a work group formed by gubernatorial fiat in the face of state lawmakers’ refusal to back an $850 million, 1,500-bed men’s prison in Lincoln County in February.
Lt. Gov. Tony Venhuizen, chairman of the work group, said the report supports the group’s first official vote last month, which was to conclude that the state does need at least one new prison. 
Venhuizen was quick to point out that the $2 billion price tag would only apply if the state followed the consultant’s guidance to the letter and built two large prisons, but said the population projections lay bare the stakes of South Dakota’s current approach to criminal justice.
The work group’s job is not to address the drivers of prison population growth, he said. But he also said he’s glad the report took note of those driving forces. 
The truth in sentencing bill, SB 146, requires people convicted of violent offenses to serve between 85% and 100% of their sentences, depending on the category of their crime.
As a legislator in 2023, Venhuizen voted against SB 146, and its potential to impact prison populations “was part of the reason why.”
“Those decisions are not free. You have to strike a balance there,” Venhuizen said. “If you’re sending people to prison for longer, there is a cost to that.”
The bill’s author and prime sponsor, Republican former Sen. Brent Hoffman, has a different take on the legislation’s impact on South Dakota’s correctional needs. 
“The real issue isn’t SB 146, which protects the public by requiring violent criminals to serve their sentences,” said Hoffman, a supporter of term limits who served one term and opted against running for a second in 2024. “The underlying, systemic problems are recidivism rates, wasteful spending, misguided priorities and incompetence, and those problems won’t be solved by any consultant’s report or politician’s rhetoric.”
Prison population growth
Every correctional facility in South Dakota is beyond its capacity now. The South Dakota State Penitentiary was built in 1881 to house one inmate per cell, but holds twice as many. 
The proposed 1,500-bed facility in Lincoln County, mired in controversy over cost and necessity and still tied up in litigation over its location, was meant to replace the penitentiary. 
There are two other housing units on the penitentiary campus in Sioux Falls, however, and each of those faces its own issues with overcrowding.
The maximum-security Jameson Annex, for example, is overbooked because it houses not only maximum security inmates, but those in disciplinary segregation and those with serious mental health needs. It’s also the sorting zone for every new male inmate in the state system, where inmates stay as they’re assessed for longer-term placement.
With $50 million spent already, state hires new consultant to restart prison planning

The Sioux Falls Minimum Center, meanwhile, holds 245 men in a building designed for 96.
Even with a large but temporary drop during the COVID-19 pandemic, new admissions to Department of Corrections custody grew an average of 3.2% a year between 2015 and 2024, the report says.
That’s in spite of a crime rate in South Dakota that’s lower than the national average and on the decline. The state’s total population has gone the other direction, increasing by 0.9% a year since 2010.
Much of the long-term factors built into the new report were present for its predecessor, a report from Omaha’s DLR group that pointed to a 1,500-bed men’s facility as one of several necessary projects for the DOC.
Senate Bill 146 is a wrinkle that didn’t exist for the DLR group, some portions of which were used by Arrington Watkins in its expedited, two-month repeat assessment.
SB 146 ropes in fewer than 10% of the state’s inmates, the report notes – drug offenses are the most common charge for which South Dakotans are imprisoned – but the inability of those convicted of violent offenses to be released before serving at least 85% of their sentence will have a long-term impact on prison population growth.
“Roughly half” of the 1,246 more inmates the report anticipates South Dakota will have by 2036 is attributable to SB 146.
Parole violations are another driver of population growth, the report notes. About 45% of new admissions to the DOC came by way of parole violations in 2024, the report says, and 84% of those violations “were technical in nature rather than new criminal charges.”
Minnehaha County State’s Attorney Daniel Haggar cautioned that technical parole violations often involve serious misbehavior, however. Technical violations include drug use, he said, as well as absconding – losing touch with a parole officer altogether.
“When those offenders are violent offenders or sex offenders this is a threat to public safety,” he said in an email to South Dakota Searchlight on Friday.
Responses colored with skepticism of price tag, conclusions
The state has already spent more than $50 million on the Lincoln County site, although a share of that money could be clawed back by selling land or reusing aspects of the now-stalled prison’s design.
Governor relents, appoints task force to reset prison talks after legislative loss

The new report’s top recommendation is a 1,700-bed, Level V facility, built within 30 miles of the existing penitentiary to relieve crowding across the entirety of the men’s prison system. It also recommends demolishing the 1881 penitentiary.
“Level V” is correctional nomenclature for maximum security.
Former penitentiary warden Doug Weber wrote seven letters to lawmakers during the 2025 session urging them to say no to the 1,500-bed facility in Lincoln County, essentially a smaller version of what the new report says is necessary. 
The focus on the factors driving the state’s prison population growth raises important questions, Weber told South Dakota Searchlight on Friday, but he disagrees strongly with its conclusions on how to remedy the situation.
“There’s nobody in South Dakota, in my opinion, except a handful of people, maybe in Pierre, that would be comfortable spending $2.1 billion on buildings for the Department of Corrections,” said Weber. “There are much better ways to spend money.”
Weber called a Level V facility unnecessary and too expensive in a state where the number of maximum security inmates hovers around 200. 
He also bristles at the idea of knocking down the pen. Millions have been spent to maintain it in recent years, including for air conditioning less than five years ago, and Weber said it could easily serve as a minimum security facility by removing the cell doors and putting a single person in each cell.
Republican Speaker of the House Jon Hansen, a work group member and candidate for governor in 2026, said “there’s absolutely no way that I will support spending that much money on prisons.”
“If we needed to be building new facilities, we should be looking at the current location in Sioux Falls for a lot less money,” Hansen said.
Prison work group peppered with public testimony in first Sioux Falls meeting

Madeline Voegeli, one of the neighbors to the Lincoln County site who sued the state over the issue, said in an email to Searchlight that the group has serious doubts about the veracity of the report’s population projections.
The DLR report, completed in 2022, suggested a 1,300-bed men’s prison at a cost of around $608 million.
Now, she wrote, “we’re being told to swallow a nearly quadrupled cost of up to $2.1 billion, largely driven by SB 146 and questionable population projections.”
Voegeli accused the state of engaging in a “pattern of inflating proposals to make a billion-dollar plan” – the original Lincoln County proposal – “appear reasonable.”
Venhuizen said arguments suggesting that the Lincoln County plan’s supporters tried to tip the scale in the consultant’s report are misplaced.
“It’s not a strong position to assume that everyone who disagrees with you is being dishonest,” Venhuizen said. “If you’re doing that, you should probably examine the strength of your own arguments.”
Criminal justice reform questions
Rep. Karla Lems, a Canton Republican who’s both a work group member and an avowed opponent of the Lincoln County proposal, said Friday that she’s skeptical of the conclusions, as well.
The work group is meant to deliver its recommendations to a special legislative session in July. The state, she said, needs to spend more time thinking about reducing repeat offenses before it decides what to build.
Rep. Brian Mulder, R-Sioux Falls, is also a work group member. He said the state needs to think “innovatively” on how to reduce prison populations, and that the report is a clear sign of how necessary that is. Mulder was one of the prime sponsors of a bill to change the penalty for first- and second-offense drug ingestion from a felony to a misdemeanor during the 2025 session. 
Too few prisoners are getting drug treatment, Mulder said, and he feels the state ought to consider partnering with nonprofits to extend treatment’s reach both inside the prison and outside, for parolees.
He also has questions about parole supervision practices.
“I would ask ‘what’s going on now with things like remote monitoring,’” Mulder said. “It’s a lot more effective for the state for someone so they can continue to be held accountable, but be held at home.”

Mulder supported truth in sentencing and continues to, though. He said parole reforms make more sense. 
Reforms to truth in sentencing laws ought to be up for consideration, though, according to Zoë Towns, executive director of a bipartisan think tank called Fwd.Us.
Her group pushes for changes to criminal justice and immigration policy. The knock-on effects of incarceration for families and communities are heavy, Towns said, and the returns for public safety diminish significantly when inmates don’t have a chance to earn credit for good behavior – even when the people earning them committed violent offenses.
“What we should be asking is ‘how long is incapacitation actually helpful?’” Towns said. “What are the policies that are most likely to help people, when they come home, to contribute to their communities and local economies?”
Addressing behavioral health needs and addiction early on are more effective ways to deal with crime than incarceration, she said, but other strategies are even further removed from criminal justice.
Towns pointed to research from places like the Brookings Institute that suggest investments in youth education and public health offer long-term returns for public safety.
“It’s literally after school and public school programs,” Towns said. “That has a stronger homicide reduction rate than policing does. I’m not saying there’s not a role for policing. I’m saying that actually, factually, in evidence, has a stronger return than sleeping in prison.”
The next Project Prison Reset meeting is June 3 in Pierre.

Toddlers lobby for Diaper Bank funding
The tiniest lobbyists had a heavy task, trying to get the appropriation for diapers more than doubled after the Lamont administration and legislature’s Appropriations Committee have finished versions of the state budget.The Diaper Bank of Connecticut, which provides diapers to Medicaid-eligible families, was not hesitant to play the cute card Thursday, having toddlers at the state Capitol as they lobby for more money.This is the time of year when some legislators, overwhelmed by the requests for money, ofttimes for needs they would love to meet, are tempted to walk by the throngs of advocates with eyes fixed on some distant point. Hence, the mini-lobbyists, as well as robocalling using kids, to see if the $756,000 in the budget for diapers just might get bumped to, say, maybe $2 million?Janet Stolfi Alfano of the Diaper Bank said she knows that some lawmakers might rank diapers behind even more basic needs like housing and food. “We don’t fit nicely into one of those buckets,” she said.But she points to Yale research that found a top source of maternal stress was the availability and affordability of diapers, which she found shocking. “We knew it was significant,” she said.The Diaper Bank is 20 years old, founded in 2004 after a social worker saw the need and some families who tried to the stretch the supply in ways potential harmful to the babies. The state put $150,000 in the budget in 2007, then nothing in 2008, when the bottom fell out of the economy and state finances. They’ve received hundreds of thousands since then each year, but it’s not enough to serve the need.“As of now, we’re $756,000 a year, and we’re serving about 6,000 kids with that. But we know there’s about 70,000” more who could qualify using Medicaid eligibility as a standard, she said.Efforts to make it covered by Medicaid have not gone anywhere. “While we’re glad it wasn’t cut, we know that we could be serving more families,” she said. “We could scale up very easily.”— Mark Pazniokas, Capitol Bureau Chief
Inspector general transition
Gov. Ned Lamont announced Wednesday that Judge Eliot Prescott would assume the post of inspector general this summer.The office of the Inspector General was created in the 2020 Police Accountability Law, and established in 2021. The inspector general’s role involves investigating deaths of incarcerated individuals in custody and incidents in which people are killed by police officers.Inspector General Robert Devlin, who has held the post since 2021, only brought one single case to trial during his tenure – that of State Trooper Brian North, who was tried for manslaughter after shooting 19-year-old Mubarak Soulemane, who was the subject of a high-speed chase in 2020. North was acquitted in 2024.Devlin said during a press conference Wednesday that the verdict in North’s trial has not changed the way he thinks about the way the office should operate.“The statute’s very clear. If the inspector general determines that that shooting is not justified, we’re to bring it to court and present that case, and the fair-minded jurors in our state will make a decision about it. So it hasn’t changed my view of that at all,” said Devlin.Lamont emphasized the importance of the inspector general’s role in establishing trust between the community and law enforcement. Prescott said he believed that if cases in which law enforcement found itself at odds with the public were handled fairly, it could lessen the controversy that surrounded them.There are currently over 20 investigations pending in the inspector general’s office. The most recent report addresses a death while in the custody of the Wolcott Police Department that dates back to October 2023.— Emilia Otte, Justice Reporter
Lamont talks transportation funding
The few hundred state transportation officials gathered in Hartford had an assortment of projects to ooh and ahh at: a newly-renovated State Pier, a well-regarded bus rapid-transit system and, of course, lots of highway construction.The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials — led this year by Connecticut’s own transportation commissioner, Garrett Eucalitto — held its spring conference at the Connecticut Convention Center this week.On Wednesday, Gov. Ned Lamont stopped by to deliver a keynote speech praising Eucalitto’s work and the federal money that is funding much of it.“As Garrett and I go around the state, we’re christening bridges that are being replaced — a lot of movable bridges were built by William McKinley, Donald Trump’s favorite president,” Lamont joked. “We’re retrofitting, rebuilding and getting those going again.”Lamont’s general message of optimism was tempered somewhat, however, when he cautioned the federal government — and by extension the Trump administration — not to be “spasmodic” about how they dole out money for transportation projects.Under the Biden administration, Connecticut was pledged billions of dollars to upgrade its aging rail and highway infrastructure. Lamont has previously raised concerns that Trump could seek to halt some of that funding, leaving behind a string of unfinished projects.So far at least, Lamont said that appears not to be the case. “The money that was promised to us seems to be flowing,” he told a reporter outside the convention hall, along with a small overture to the president.“I’d like to think that President Trump’s a builder, he knows how important infrastructure was in and around his buildings ” Lamont said. “He was there knocking the doors of probably some AASHTO guys, saying, ‘I need this to keep my building going.’”— John Moritz, Environment & Energy reporter
Shark-finning ban passes House
State lawmakers looking to crack down on any potential for “shark finning” in Connecticut waters voted to advance a statewide ban on Tuesday.Shark finning refers to the practice — already prohibited under federal law — of catching a shark, removing its fins and dumping the rest of the animal’s body back in the ocean.Because their fins are valued as a delicacy in certain overseas markets, sharks have become subject to overfishing that has put some species at the risk of extinction, according to the World Wildlife Fund.House Bill 5012 attempts to close what some lawmakers have referred to as a ‘loophole’ in the state and federal protections for sharks by banning the possession of a dismembered shark fin in Connecticut. The ban would not prohibit anglers from catching sharks if they intend to use the whole body.Even without a ban, the practice does not appear to be widespread in Connecticut. A review of the bill by the nonpartisan Office of Fiscal Analysis estimated that the state would collect less than $500 in fines each year as a result of a ban.The bill passed the House unanimously on Tuesday and now heads to the Senate for further consideration.— John Moritz, Environment & Energy Reporter
Working group on poverty
Lawmakers in the House of Representatives voted Wednesday evening to create a working group to study ways to alleviate poverty in the state of Connecticut.Rep. Corey Paris, D-Stamford, told lawmakers that the working group would focus on things like  universal basic income, targeted workforce training, and creating methods for “ measurable economic mobility” for the most disadvantaged.According to the most recent report from United Way, 11% of Connecticut residents live below the poverty line, and 40% live below the ALICE threshold – a measurement of the basic cost of living in a geographic area.The bill was met with pushback from Republicans, several of whom said that Connecticut already offered many programs to help residents. “We provide SNAP money, WIC money, diaper care, health care, dental care, housing, supplements, baby bonds, college supplements … and the list goes on and on and on. I would argue that we have done so much to look at poverty and we’re already doing much, much more than probably many of the states around us,” said Rep. Anne Dauphinais, R-Killingly.Several Republicans also objected to the idea of introducing a Universal Basic Income proposal. “So we’re going to tax you, member of the state, and then we’re just going to give you a cash payment right back. Seems like a whole waste of time. Let the person keep the cash in the first place,” said Rep. Joe Canino, R-Torrington.Democrats pushed back. Rep. Anthony Nolan, D-New London, noted that the high cost of things like health care, transportation and child care weigh particularly on low-income families.“My soup kitchen in my district hands out about a million meals a year. That’s not SNAP. That’s because SNAP doesn’t cover it all,” added Rep. Susan Johnson, D-Windham.The bill passed 110-37.— Emilia Otte, Justice Reporter
Senate passes higher ed scholarship bill
Senate Bill 5, one of the Higher Education and Employment Advancement Committee’s top priority bills, passed out of the Senate Wednesday.The bill targeted better enforcement of the Roberta B. Willis Scholarship Program, a need-based and merit-based scholarship that provides Connecticut students between $4,500 and $5,200 to attend in-state higher education institutions.In February, lawmakers said about two-thirds of the students, or around 16,000, who qualified for the scholarship did not receive funds in FY22. The proposed bill would require that need-based grants equal to $4,500 per student are fully funded and for the Office of Higher Education to notify universities of the amount of scholarship money they can expect for the following fiscal year.Senate Democrats said the provisions would “help students weigh the benefits of enrolling in-state accurately.”“The cost of higher education continues to grow, and our underfunded state scholarship program encourages students to seek education elsewhere,” said Senate President Martin Looney in a news release following the bill’s passage. “By investing in our students and giving them timely notice of the amount of their Roberta Willis grants, we are allowing Connecticut students to stay in this state to receive their education, enter the workforce, grow our economy and enjoy the high quality life we have built here in Connecticut.”The bill passed unanimously.— Jessika Harkay, Education Reporter
Student mental health bill passed by House
A bill meant to ensure more seamless communication between medical providers and schools regarding students’ mental health passed out of the state House of Representatives Thursday 105-42. 
House Bill 7158 would require health care providers to share “safety plans” with schools for students who spend 12 or more days in a hospital for behavioral health concerns. The plans, which would consist of things like coping strategies and other recommendations to support the child, would only be shared with school counselors, nurses or other staff who would need the information to keep the child safe in class. The plans would be shared through a secure messaging system provided by the Office of Health Strategy, according to the bill.Currently, safety plans can only be shared if a parent brings a physical copy to the school, said Rep. Patrick Biggins, D-East Hartford, who proposed the bill.“This allows a way for the hospitals to communicate directly to school, which will make the second communication a little bit quicker,” Biggins said. “If the safety plan is shared with the school, then they would have knowledge of the steps to take in order to keep the child safe.”— Jessika Harkay, Education Reporter
Bill aims to help towns reduce blight
The Senate on Wednesday passed a bill that would allow towns to put liens on properties where code violation fees have gone unpaid.Senate Bill 1317 is the latest attempt from the Connecticut legislature to give towns more tools to combat poor rental housing conditions and reduce blight. Connecticut tenants, particularly those with out-of-state landlords, have long said they struggle to get repairs done and are living in unsafe housing conditions.The New Haven delegation issued a press release in support of the bill after its passage. “When housing density is high, it only takes a few violations to impact entire neighborhoods,” said Sen. Gary Winfield, D-New Haven, in the release. “This bill empowers New Haven and other cities to take necessary actions to uphold housing standards and protect public spaces.”The bill passed with bipartisan support and next heads to the House for a vote.— Ginny Monk, Housing & Children’s Issues Reporter
Measure prevents discrimination against abuse victims
A bill regarding victims of human trafficking and sexual assault passed in the House 139-4 on Thursday.The bill prohibits current or prospective employers and landlords from discriminating against victims of rape, sexual assault or human trafficking. Rep. Steven Stafstrom, D-Bridgeport, said victims of rape, sexual assault or human trafficking cannot be penalized by their employer if they have to take time off work to attend court proceedings.But Rep. Craig Fishbein, R-Wallingford, questioned why these protections did not extend to all victims – for example, if someone had their car stolen and was unable to get to work.Fishbein also objected to the idea of an “affirmative defense” for human trafficking victims who commit misdemeanors directly related to being trafficked.Stafstrom gave the example of someone who was a victim of human trafficking and ended up prostituting themselves. “It’s a crime. It’s a misdemeanor offense to engage in prostitution. But they did so because they were trafficked here from out of state, and essentially sold into committing that particular crime,” said Stafstrom.But Fishbein said he didn’t feel that misdemeanors were only small crimes, adding that negligent homicide was considered a misdemeanor. “I’m concerned that someone is going to admit that they killed someone and make this claim of human trafficking, which may be very difficult to prove,” said Fishbein.Rep. Tammy Nuccio, R-Tolland, said she felt the need to disclose to a landlord or an employer that a victim had been sexually assaulted or raped in order to be protected from discrimination was “revictimizing” the person, and noted that victims of sexual assault were still victims even if they chose not to press charges or to discuss what happened to them.— Emilia Otte, Justice Reporter
Bear hunt is back
A controversial proposal to allow bear hunting in Connecticut was resurrected on Thursday, more than a month after being left for dead by state lawmakers.In March, members of the legislature’s Environment Committee stripped language from Senate Bill 1523 that would have allowed the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection to establish a hunting season for black bears, whose numbers have risen to an estimated 1,000 to 1,200 animals in the state.When the bill appeared Thursday on the Senate floor, however, it came with an amendment adding the hunting language back in. The bill’s sponsor, state Rep. Rick Lopes, D-New Britain, said the bill would leave it up to DEEP and the governor’s office to determine whether a hunt is necessary to address a growing number of conflicts with bears.“At the point that if they feel that human-bear conflicts have risen to a level that endangers public safety they could start… to look into a hunt,” he said.Opponents of a hunt said they were surprised by the sudden change in the bill. “There was no warning that this was being done,” said Lori Brown, the executive director of the League of Conservation Voters. “It’s because it’s so controversial, there’s been so much opposition.”The amended bill passed the Senate on a vote 34 to 2, with senators Christine Cohen, D-Guilford, and Mae Flexer, D-Killingly, voting in opposition. It now heads to the House for further consideration.— John Moritz, Environment & Energy Reporter",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TRUST-ACT-0515_SR-6-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-16 20:03:10.357634

Mike Dunleavy has chosen a state government veteran to be the new commissioner of the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation.
Dunleavy announced Thursday that he has selected Randy Bates, a former head of the department’s Division of Water.
“Randy is uniquely suited to assume the role of commissioner-designee for DEC and continue to push my Administration’s agenda to develop our plentiful resources responsibly and to minimize the impacts for all our actions on the environment,” Dunleavy said in a statement.
Bates, in the statement released by Dunleavy, said he is honored to be appointed. He also reinforced the governor’s emphasis on resource development.
“My primary goal as commissioner will be to continue the department’s mission of balancing the need for responsible development and preserving Alaska’s pristine lands and waters and wildlife,” Bates said in the statement.
Prior to serving as director of DEC’s Division of Water, Bates was director of the Division of Habitat at the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. He also fishes commercially in Southeast Alaska.
Bates replaces Acting Commissioner Christina Carpenter, who has been in that role since January, when former DEC Commissioner Emma Pokon was appointed as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Pacific Northwest regional administrator.
Carpenter is moving to a new job outside of state government but will remain at the department as deputy commissioner through the end of the month to help with the transition, Dunleavy said.  
Bates’ appointment is subject to confirmation by the Legislature. Since the Legislature held its annual confirmation joint session on Wednesday, it will be nearly a year before it votes on Bates.

Jim Pillen signs off on the 2024 general election results on Monday, Dec. 2, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — It’s not every day that Nebraska’s three branches of government are all involved in a single topic. But one issue is front and center within the next week: medical cannabis.
Days before legislative debate and a Lincoln court hearing, Gov. Jim Pillen on Friday announced “intentions” for executive branch staff to offer available administrative support and resources for voter-approved medical cannabis regulators to begin their work.
“With support from the Policy Research Office, the Department of Administrative Services and other agencies, as necessary, the Medical Cannabis Commission is fully enabled to meet and carry out its responsibilities under the Patient Protection Act and the Regulation Act to meet its milestone dates of July 1 [for regulations] and October 1 [for licensing],” the release said.
Any regulations proposed by the commission would need to go through the attorney general and the governor.

State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, whose Legislative Bill 677 seeks to clarify and place additional guardrails, confirmed he will still push forward with the legislation and was “a little surprised” by an executive about-face that now seeks to “unilaterally” enact regulations.
He said he sees LB 677 as the Legislature’s responsibility to act and set parameters for regulators that “can’t be changed at a whim.”
State Sen. Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue, chair of the Legislature’s General Affairs Committee that is mulling medical cannabis legislation, said the executive action diminishes Hansen’s previous argument that the laws could be the “wild west” if the Legislature doesn’t provide more guidance. 
“I think there’s actually been some thought into establishing the cannabis control commission. It’s not a bad thing,” Holdcroft told the Nebraska Examiner on Friday.
But Hansen, in response, said: “I’m not worried about the ‘wild west’ anymore. I’m worried about nothing happening, and then we have recreational cannabis in two years.”
He cites voters who have said that if the regulations are too restrictive, they will push a 2026 ballot measure for recreational marijuana, including some voters who prefer only medical use.
Appointees will follow ‘letter of the law’
Hansen adds that part of the reason LB 677 is still needed is Pillen’s two at-large “potential” appointees to the Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission. Together, they would join the three commissioners pulling double duty on the Nebraska Liquor Control Commission to create the new entity, which voters approved in November.

Pillen has appointed Dr. Monica Oldenburg of Lincoln, an anesthesiologist, and Lorelle Mueting of Omaha, the prevention director at Heartland Family Service, which focuses on drug prevention. Both have consistently opposed efforts pushed by the Nebraskans who prevailed at the ballot box last fall after more than a decade of advocacy.

Still, Pillen said that Oldenburg and Mueting are “experienced, well-qualified individuals” who will ensure strong regulations “to the letter of the law the people of Nebraska enacted.”
“I urge the Legislature to promptly confirm them so they can take up the urgent work of writing strong and effective ‘rules of the road’ for the medical cannabis industry,” Pillen said Friday.
Both Oldenburg and Mueting opposed the closest legislative attempt to legalize medical cannabis in 2021, LB 474, led by former State Sen. Anna Wishart of Lincoln, who later helped the ballot measures. The 2021 bill fell two votes short, 31-18.
‘Other motives may be at play’
Crista Eggers, executive director of Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana, said Friday that while supporters appreciated Pillen’s actions, it is “disingenuous” to characterize the new appointments as “experienced” or “well-qualified.”
“Appointing regulators who are fundamentally opposed to the very issue they are charged with overseeing suggests that other motives may be at play — motives that appear misaligned with the public intent, and not to mention the will of 71% of the state,” Eggers said in a statement.
The legalization position passed with 71% of the vote, while the regulatory measure trailed just slightly, with about 67% support. Eggers and other long-time advocates support LB 677 as an initial step for regulations.
At a March hearing on four medical cannabis bills, Mueting opposed LB 677 and two very similar bills and was “neutral” on the narrowest bill: LB 483, from State Sen. Jared Storm of David City, seeking to limit medical cannabis to tinctures or pills alone. LB 483 sought to legalize up to 300 milligrams, 0.21% of the 5 ounces that voters approved.
Both appointees will go before the General Affairs Committee next Thursday for confirmation hearings before the full Legislature weighs in.

Laura Strimple, a spokesperson for Pillen, said the office interviewed three people and selected two. A staff member who oversees application materials for appointees was out of the office Friday, so the materials for Oldenburg and Mueting were not immediately made available.
State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha, vice chair of the General Affairs Committee, said he looks forward to the confirmation hearings but is “skeptical” of Pillen’s sincerity in helping voters.
“I will keep an open mind, but any attempt to restrict what the voters passed through bureaucratic red tape should be opposed vigorously,” Cavanaugh said in a text. “In the meantime, the Legislature should pass LB 677 to make sure that medical cannabis is legal, safe and accessible in Nebraska.”
Unclear executive branch funding
Part of Pillen’s Friday announcement mentions “operational funding” already appropriated to the Medical Cannabis Commission, but when the next two-year state budget passed Thursday, new funding was limited.
The Appropriations Committee offered an annual $30,000 each of the next two fiscal years for employees in the Liquor Control Commission, who take on additional duties under the new laws. In comparison, the Liquor Control Commission has a $2 million annual budget, including for enforcement of regulations for compliance.
There is no additional funding for the remaining two months of the current fiscal year. 
The Department of Administrative Services can provide limited financial support to agencies crafting regulations, but the Governor’s Office could not immediately provide specifics.
Legislative and legal fights await
Hansen’s LB 677 is expected to be filibustered at each stage of debate, at a maximum of eight hours on Tuesday. If so, it would require 33 votes to advance and become law at the end.

Hansen said that considering Oldenburg and Mueting are “both openly staunch anti-medical cannabis people, you can only assume the direction on maybe where they’re going to go with the implementation of this.”
“If we don’t do anything, we have no idea what to expect,” Hansen said.
Holdcroft said he would support Hansen and LB 677 by arguing in favor of a “compromise” amendment to the bill, which gives an extra three months for regulations, prohibits smoking and outlines qualifying conditions.
Pillen previously told the Examiner that cannabis wouldn’t be approved in a form that could become recreational.
“My advocacy for it is that if you have a medical condition [and] you need it, you’ll get it, but it’s going to taste like crap,” Pillen said last month. “It’s going to be a bitter pill to swallow.”
‘Effectively do business’
Also on Tuesday, Lancaster County District Judge Susan Strong will consider oral arguments on whether to dismiss a lawsuit that argues the voter-approved medical cannabis laws are unconstitutional because of federal laws outlawing marijuana.

Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers, whose office is defending Pillen and other state officials, fundamentally opposes medical cannabis. He is asking that the case be dismissed, as are the regulatory commissioners and the ballot measure sponsors.
The reason is specific: Hilgers’ staff argues that the Attorney General’s Office and not a private citizen should be the one to challenge the laws.

LB 677 also presents a different threat to a pending appeal to the Nebraska Supreme Court, including from Hilgers’ office, alleging signature fraud in the medical cannabis ballot measures. Strong rejected those arguments in November and upheld the ballot measures. The AG’s Office and a former state senator who brought both cases before Strong appealed.
Because LB 677 would provide additional legislative weight to the 2024 ballot measures, Hilgers and other advocates have acknowledged it could nullify or weaken the pending appeal. Hilgers has said he should get a “fair fight” in front of the high court. He has also pledged to sue the new commission if it issues any medical cannabis licenses in the future, too.
With Pillen’s announcement, he joined the likes of Hilgers and U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., who have argued that lawmakers should wait and pass no cannabis-related bills this year.
Said Strimple: “Governor Pillen does not believe it is necessary for LB 677 to pass because with existing statutory authority and resources, the Medical Cannabis Commission will have everything it needs to effectively do business.”

Can lawmakers get health care organizations to cut tens of millions in health care expenditures?
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Final Reading: Lawmakers encourage, but don’t require, health facilities to reduce spending.","House Majority Leader Rep. Lori Houghton, D-Essex Junction, seen on the opening day of the Legislature at the Statehouse in Montpelier on Wednesday, Jan. 8. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerVermont policymakers are facing a $200 million question. That’s the amount of spending — according to the Green Mountain Care Board — that the state’s health care system would need to trim in order to keep Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont’s premium increases to around 5% in 2026. It’s a big ask, and a short timeline. Earlier this week, Blue Cross Blue Shield issued its proposed premium increases for 2026: 13.7% for small group plans and 23.3% for individual ones. Without significant cost savings within the next few months, those numbers will likely stand. Lawmakers are working on several measures intended to lower health care costs. But many of those initiatives — such as reference-based pricing, a system that caps how much hospitals can charge for procedures and a bill to reduce the cost of building or renovating facilities — are years away from bearing fruit.Earlier this month, Rep. Lori Houghton, D-Essex Junction, introduced an amendment to a large bill, S.126, intended to trim spending in Vermont’s teetering health care system more quickly. The initial amendment, dated May 2, would have required the Agency of Human Services to “coordinate efforts by hospitals” to cut Vermont hospital spending by 10% in their fiscal year 2026, which begins Oct. 1.By the next week, the language had been softened: the agency would “facilitate collaboration and coordination” to help providers “identify opportunities” to improve health care services and reduce spending by 5%.A day later, lawmakers trimmed that savings goal further: to just 2.5%. That figure still stands in the most recent version of the bill, which was advanced by the House Appropriations Committee Friday afternoon. In an interview last week, Houghton said the initial goal of a 10% reduction in health care spending would have actually added up to $400 million — twice the number the Green Mountain Care Board asked for. So lawmakers trimmed it to 5%, which comes out to $200 million. “Then for various reasons — of just people not (being) happy, and not sure how they can do it — we did move it down to 2.5%,” Houghton said.But whatever the number is, the legislation is not intended to force health care facilities to cut spending: “There’s no mandate,” Houghton said. “Lots of times when we pass legislation, it is the intent that’s important, right?” she said. “And it’s also the fact that we need Vermonters to see that we’re all trying to find a solution to this really immediate problem.”— Peter D’AuriaIn the knowVermont is on track to join a growing list of states that have banned smartphones from the classroom.This week, lawmakers in a key committee advanced legislation that would require all of the state’s public school districts and independent schools to develop policies prohibiting students from using smartphones and other personal devices like smartwatches during the school day. The policies would need to take effect by the 2026-2027 school year.A school cell phone ban was previously introduced in a standalone bill that has failed to move forward this legislative session. But on Thursday members of the Senate Committee on Education voted to graft the ban onto H.480, a miscellaneous education bill that includes several smaller adjustments to Vermont’s education laws. Now, with broad support in both chambers, lawmakers hope to send the bill to Gov. Phil Scott’s desk by the end of the session. Read more about the new bill language here. — Habib SabetGov. Phil Scott has issued his third veto of the session, rejecting H.219, a bill that would require the Department of Corrections to roll out a program providing free family support services to incarcerated parents and guardians across state prisons. (Scott also vetoed two versions of the fiscal year 2025 budget adjustment bill.)Scott wrote in a letter explaining his decision Thursday that he supported the bill’s intent but not specific language within it that would require his administration to put funding for the program in future budget proposals to the Legislature. Such a requirement violates the state Constitution, he said.The veto may not matter much, though, since funding to run programs for incarcerated parents at two state prisons has already been included in the 2026 budget bill, which the House and Senate both approved this week. Scott supports that funding, too, he said in his veto letter.Rep. Troy Headrick, a Burlington Independent who sponsored H.219, said in an interview Friday that Scott has also expressed support for legislators’ intent, also laid out in the bill, to have the administration expand the program to all state prisons by 2028. Legislators may rework some of the language that Scott opposed in H.219 in the remaining weeks of this year’s session, Headrick said, or could take the legislation up again at the start of next year’s session. — Shaun RobinsonOn the moveA key Senate committee advanced the Legislature’s landmark education bill Thursday, but not before nearly every committee member vented their discomfort with the legislation. “I can’t remember ever feeling as bad about a vote as I do on this one, but it will move us forward,” Sen. Ann Cummings, D-Washington, the Senate Finance Committee’s chair, told her colleagues after voting out H.454. The bill proposes generational changes to Vermont’s school governance and finance systems that would phase in over multiple years, including school district consolidation and a new education funding formula, but leaves open some key decision points for the future. Read more about the Senate’s version of the education reform bill here. — Ethan WeinsteinThe Senate on Friday passed H.1, a bill that would eliminate a requirement from state law that the Legislature’s two internal ethics panels consult with the State Ethics Commission over cases in which lawmakers are accused of potential misconduct. Legislators have argued that the consultation requirement, part of a sweeping set of changes to state ethics laws enacted in 2024, infringed on the separation of powers guaranteed in the state Constitution. But the proposal has drawn repeated opposition from the Ethics Commission, which argued it could be the start of a slippery slope of reneging on last year’s accountability measures.The bill will now head back to the House to consider the Senate’s changes.— Shaun RobinsonVisit our 2025 bill tracker for the latest updates on major legislation we are following.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Final Reading: Lawmakers encourage, but don’t require, health facilities to reduce spending.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/lori-houghton-1-20250108-1024x676.jpg,,,2025-05-16 19:05:51.346194

Jared Polis signed an executive order Friday that pushes local governments to comply with certain state housing laws as a condition of receiving state grant funding, at the Colorado Capitol in Denver. (Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)Colorado Gov. Jared Polis signed an executive order Friday that pushes local governments to comply with certain state housing laws as a condition of receiving state grant funding. 
The order directs several state agencies to identify funding opportunities that can be prioritized for local governments and projects that align with state housing priorities. It highlights seven state laws passed in the last two years that aim to increase housing options across the state.
Polis said the goal of the executive order is to ensure those who receive discretionary grant funding from the state are prioritizing state efforts to increase housing stock, affordability and sustainability. He estimated over $100 million dollars in state funding will be subject to the order.

“Today we’re taking action to make sure that the limited state funding opportunities are prioritized for local governments that are following state housing laws and land use laws and doing their part so hardworking Coloradans to afford to live, work and thrive across our state of Colorado,” Polis said at a press conference in his office at the Colorado Capitol, where he signed the executive order Friday.
While many local governments have supported housing policies approved by the Colorado Legislature in recent years, others opposed the policies and indicated concerns about compliance. Polis said he wants local governments to be able to go through DOLA to help them achieve compliance with new state housing laws. 
“We want to make sure everybody is working in good faith and has a plan to implement these laws,” Polis said. “Some counties have just thought about it and worked on it more than others, and we want to make sure that everybody thinks about it and works on it and gets it done because housing is a statewide issue.”
Laws covered by the executive order include 2024 measures to prohibit residential occupancy limits, require higher-density housing near transit stops, prohibit local minimum parking requirements, legalize the construction of accessory dwelling units, and encourage more sustainable affordable housing, as well as 2025 polices that set regional building codes for factory-built homes and allow some multifamily buildings to have just one staircase.
Housing availability and affordability has been a growing crisis in Colorado that state legislators worked to improve since 2023. A 2023 housing executive order Polis signed said the state is short tens of thousands of housing units, and his new order says the same concerns continue to escalate. 
Some of the laws included in the order are not yet implemented, so the provisions of the executive order will apply after the measures take effect. 
The executive order requires state agencies including the Colorado Department of Transportation, the Colorado Energy Office, the Department of Local Affairs, and the Office of Economic Development and International Trade to submit a list within 30 days of potential competitive grants and other discretionary funding sources that could be subject to the requirements of the order. 
The order will be updated once the governor’s office compiles a list of grants and funding to be included, and it will apply to funding awarded after Oct. 6.

Sears/Maryland Matters)Gov. Wes Moore (D) announced Friday that he will veto the Reparations Commission bill that called for a study of historic inequality endured by African descendants in Maryland.
The veto of a reparations measure by the only sitting Black governor in the nation was included a list of vetoes of bills, many of which called for summer study of an issue, typically the most innocuous type of legislation. The list of 23 bills was released late Friday afternoon by the governor’s office.
Moore’s list also includes a bill in the energy package backed by House and Senate leadership, which created a Strategic Energy Planning Office focused on the state’s energy needs.
Reaction was swift, and in some cases angry, from lawmakers, who were already discussing veto overrides.
“The governor is my friend. I think a lot of him, but I am every disappointed in him today,” said Sen. C. Anthony Muse (D-Prince George’s), who sponsored the Senate version of the reparations bill. “I’m very disappointed that something like this, that Black communities across the country have been asking for, it’s turned down in our state,”
Sponsors began getting the news Friday afternoon of the coming vetoes of their bills. Reparations was the most high-profile bill to be shot down, and chatter was widespread before the official announcement, but others learned of the demise of their bills to study the effects of climate change and to look at the impact of data centers on the state.

Gov. Wes Moore (D) announced Friday that he will veto 23 bills passed by the 2025 General Assembly — more than in the previous two years combined, when he vetoed 13 and four, respectively. This year’s vetoes included some high-profile proposals, including a bill to create reparations study commission and another to look at the impact of data centers.

Sen. Katie Fry Hester (D-Howard and Montgomery) said she got a text from one of the governor’s staffers Friday, alerting her that her bill, originally titled the RENEW Act, was going to be vetoed. The bill would have commissioned a study from the comptroller’s office on the effects of greenhouse gas emissions in the state, and it was a milder alternative to the original language that would have called for a system to make businesses that extract fossil fuels pay fees to mitigate the effects of climate change.
“I think a study is a very reasonable next step, and the money was allocated in the budget,” Hester said. “This is very shortsighted, because this is a bill that will eventually save taxpayers money.”
The bill was to be funded mostly by $500,000 from the Strategic Energy Investment Fund, which is fueled by “alternative compliance payments”  utilities pay when they have not purchased enough renewable energy to comply with state mandates. That fund has burgeoned in recent years with an influx of payments, including $318 million in fiscal 2024.
Advocates were angered by the move. Mike Tidwell, founder and director of the Chesapeake Climate Action Network, called the governor’s veto of the RENEW study “unforgiveable.”
“I will make sure that voters in the state never forget what he’s done with this veto,” Tidwell said, adding that the governor’s office expressed no reservations about the bill as recently as mid-March.
The veto was “inconceivable,” given that Maryland has thousands of miles of shoreline vulnerable to climate change, and the $500,000 study could have paved the way toward tens of millions of dollars in compensatory payments from fossil fuel companies, Tidwell said.

“His math doesn’t add up. His political calculus is arguably even worse, because turning his back on Marylanders suffering from climate change today is an enormously politically damaging act,” Tidwell said.
Sen. Karen Lewis Young (D-Frederick) said she heard from the governor’s team Friday that her bill, studying the potential financial, environmental and energy effects of data centers in Maryland would be among the vetoes. In Frederick, development of an expansive Quantum Loophole campus has been underway for years, prompting Lewis Young’s interest in the subject.
“I’m really disappointed that, given what a big topic this is for the state — and in particular for my county — that we wouldn’t proceed with a study,” Lewis Young said.
Lewis Young said she was surprised to learn of the veto, especially given that the governor’s team did not express any reservations about the bill or its cost during the legislative session. The report was to cost about $502,000, with funds pulled from the Maryland Department of the Environment, the Maryland Energy Administration and the University System of Maryland, according to its fiscal note.
More economical still was the reparations bill: Versions that failed in previous years had price tags around $1 million, but the version on the governor’s desk this year was only expected to cost $54,500. The will called for most of the work to be one by existing state employees or by researches at Bowie State University, one of the state’s historically black colleges and universities.
The bill’s supporters have pointed out repeatedly that the bill does not require any payments or support. It only calls for study of historic inequality suffered by African descendants, and recommendations for future action, if any.
“It’s not as though it was going to do something. It’s a study,” Muse said Friday evening. “When have we known a study to cause a veto? At the end of the study, nothing else has been done, except we studied it. I don’t understand it. I will not understand it.”
Advocates rallied in Annapolis a week ago, urging the governor to sign the bill, which had the backing of the Legislative Black Caucus. The caucus released a statement to express “deep disappointment” in the governor’s decision and that the “legislature will have a final say” when lawmakers meet to consider veto overrides.
“At a time when the White House and Congress are actively targeting Black communities, dismantling diversity initiatives and using harmful coded language, Governor Moore had a chance to show the country and the world that here in Maryland we boldly and courageously recognize our painful history and the urgent need to address it,” the caucus said in a statement Friday evening.
“Instead, the State’s first Black governor chose to block this historic legislation that would have moved the state toward directly repairing the harm of enslavement,” the statement said.
The bill called for the creation of a commission that would assess specific federal, state and local policies from 1877 to 1965, the post-Reconstruction and Jim Crow eras that “led to economic disparities based on race, including housing, segregation and discrimination, redlining, restrictive covenants, and tax policies.”
The all-volunteer commission would also have examined how public and private institutions may have benefited from those policies, and would then recommend appropriate reparations, which could include statements of apology, monetary compensation, social service assistance, business incentives or child care costs.
The 24-member commission would have had to deliver a preliminary report of recommendations by Jan. 1, 2027, to explain any findings, and a final report by Nov. 1 of that year.

State health officials alerted the public that they could have been exposed to the virus at a Trader Joe’s in Albuquerque, along with a big medical center in Rio Rancho. 
As of Friday, there are 74 confirmed cases across New Mexico, state health officials told Source New Mexico. 
In addition to providing daily updates on the virus’ spread, health officials also provide dates, times and locations where people may have been exposed, along with a list of places where people can walk in to receive vaccines. 

Read all of Source’s measles coverage here. 

Infected people have been in a Denny’s in Hobbs, a school gym in Lovington, a preschool in Las Cruces and various medical clinics in southern and northern New Mexico in recent months. 
Measles symptoms begin with a cough, runny nose and eye redness, before progressing to fever and rash that starts at the head before moving down the body. Health officials advise that people who have measles can infect others from four days before the rash appears and remain contagious four days after the rash is gone.
In addition to Sandoval County, New Mexico has now seen confirmed cases in Chaves, Curry, Doña Ana, Eddy and Lea counties. Currently, more than 1,000 measles cases have been reported nationwide, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The health department encourages people with symptoms who have been exposed to measles to call NMDOH Helpline at 1-833-SWNURSE (1-833-796-8773) for guidance in English and Spanish. If planning to see a doctor or visit an emergency room, call first so health care providers can plan for a visit by someone who may have measles.

The change from the federal agency does not affect the state’s efforts to continue work already underway to reduce levels of PFAS at contaminated sites, the state’s director of drinking water regulation said. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont officials reevaluate new state standards for toxic forever chemicals as EPA eases stance.","Stock photo by Nithin PA via PexelsVermont environmental officials are pausing to reevaluate a stricter state standard for certain harmful forever chemicals after a change in stance by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency earlier this week. Barely one year after the EPA passed historic rules to reduce the amounts of certain harmful forever chemicals in drinking water, the agency is now considering reversing some of those regulations and pushing back the timeline for drinking water systems to comply with others.When the set of federal regulations passed under President Joe Biden, they set allowable levels of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, known as PFAS, even lower than Vermont’s existing standards, which had been in place for five years. The stricter rules meant an additional 30 drinking water suppliers in the state needed to remove PFAS.  Now, the state’s progress on formalizing those rules is on something of a pause, as officials wait to hear more information about the federal decision.“The amount of information we have as a state, is about the same as what the public has been receiving,” said Bryan Redmond, the director of the Drinking Water and Groundwater Protection Division in the state Department of Environmental Conservation. “We are waiting to schedule some time with the EPA to learn what the details of this mean.” Wednesday’s announcement from the EPA keeps the Biden-area levels for two chemicals in the sprawling PFAS family. There can be only 4 parts per trillion or less of PFOA and PFOS chemicals detected in drinking water. However, the agency has now added two more years on the deadline for meeting those levels — meaning municipalities now have to comply by 2031, instead of 2029. The agency is also announcing a federal exemption framework for some communities struggling to remove the harmful chemicals from drinking water.The existing rules had also set a limit of 10 parts per trillion of four other types of PFAS chemicals. The EPA announced it now intends to rescind and reconsider the regulations for those other four regulated chemicals. There are more than 12,000 chemicals in this class of compounds.PFOA and PFOS are some of the most commonly occurring compounds in the PFAS family, and those are the two chemicals that typically drive the contamination issues in Vermont, according to Redmond. The chemicals in high doses are linked to a litany of harmful health effects, largely because they are suspected of interrupting hormone chemical signaling in the body, and thus can lead to a range of maladies, from cancers and reproductive health problems to cardiovascular challenges and weakened immune systems. Redmond said the next step for the state is to evaluate the EPA actions, taking thorough account of the science, the health impacts and technical details of PFAS removal. “It’s possible to move forward with the existing standards,” he said. “It’s possible that we adopt the EPA standards, or it’s possible we do a hybrid.”Regardless, the language in the draft state rule surrounding this will have to change since it references and rests on the EPA’s standards, he said. The state is “mid-stream” in that rulemaking process, but it’s been paused due to all the uncertainty from the federal agency. This, at least, Redmond said, is a “push toward certainty,” so the state can figure out how it wants to act in response. What the federal change does not influence is the state’s progress toward remediating existing drinking water systems known to be contaminated by PFAS. “Regardless of regulation, we have been remediating down to the 4 (parts per trillion) level,” Redmond said Through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Vermont was allocated five years of funding to carry out the remediation process for impacted systems. Money has been appropriated for the third year of work, Redmond said, and he expects the state will receive that soon. Disclosure: Bryan Redmond is married to VTDigger CEO Sky Barsch.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont officials reevaluate new state standards for toxic forever chemicals as EPA eases stance.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/pexels-nithin-pa-2583028-scaled.jpg,,,2025-05-16 18:06:38.105821

Senate Bill 471 seeks to make pedestrian crossings safer, while Senate Bill 428 makes it easier for counties to change speed limits. Senate Democrats brought both bills, which passed through the House and Senate by comfortable margins.
Sen. Dave Fern brought SB 471, which introduces a new offense into Montana code — endangerment of pedestrians to clarify who has right-of-way.
“I think it basically sets up some clearly defined rules for the pedestrian and for the driver,” Fern said during a Senate hearing for the bill. “And it sets up, I think, pretty reasonable system of fines.”
The legislation added specific language for crosswalks with flashing lights, which the new law covers. If a pedestrian has already engaged the button to begin flashing the lights, a driver may not move through the intersection.
However, if the vehicle reaches a pedestrian crossing before the light is engaged, they are allowed to drive through the intersection.
The misdemeanor offense carries an initial fine between $25 and $100. Subsequent offenses carry higher penalties. If a person hits one of the beacons, or crosswalk devices, they are also now liable for the damage to them.
SB 428 gives county governments increased ability to control speed limits on roads, dropping the minimum speed they can set to 25 mph, down from the previous minimum of 35 mph. The law allows for greater control in areas classified as urban districts.
Sen. Willis Curdy, who brought the legislation, called it a safety issue. He also said some counties had been pressured into changing speed limits outside of what state law allowed them to do.
“Outside of the legislative session, a vast majority of complaints and questions my constituents have is that people are driving too fast and the county should lower the speed limits,” Curdy said during a Senate hearing for the bill. “I sympathize 100%, but I remind them that state law does not permit the county to lower the speed limit under 35 mph. Senate Bill 428 will allow counties the opportunity to make that adjustment.”
Gov. Greg Gianforte has also signed a swath of other transportation bills, including SB 433 from Sen. Theresa Manzella, R-Hamilton which changed right-of-way law in roundabouts. He also signed HB 764, a change in public transportation law that could expand municipal bus routes further.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_4954-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-16 18:06:38.105821

Jared Polis vetoed a bill on Friday afternoon that would have repealed​ a requirement for a second election to form a union, a provision that’s unique to the state.
The veto was expected, as Polis, a Democrat, said from the start of the 2025 state legislative session that he wanted to see a compromise between labor and business interests over the issue. That never came.
Senate Bill 25-5 would have repealed the state requirement for a second election following a simple majority vote, per federal law, to form a union. The second vote requires 75% approval for workers to be able to negotiate whether every employee must pay into representation fees, regardless of union membership. Colorado is the only state to have that system. It was created through the Labor Peace Act over 80 years ago.
“I believe there must be a high threshold of worker participation and approval to allow for bargaining over mandatory wage deduction. And SB 25-005 does not satisfy that threshold, which is why I am vetoing the bill,” Polis wrote in his veto letter. “Nonetheless, I was and remain open to changes to the Labor Peace Act. The law can and should be amended to more fairly allow workers to choose union security.”

Polis wrote that the current system makes it easier to fully unionize at smaller companies than at larger ones “where organizing might be even more important.” He encouraged labor and business leaders to continue conversations about how to update the law.
“This two election framework makes Colorado a unique ‘hybrid,’ allowing for union security unlike ‘open shop’ states, but requiring a high threshold of approval to achieve it. I am disappointed we did not find common ground that would have resulted in me signing an updated and fairer Labor Peace Act,” he wrote.
The bill was a priority for labor groups and progressive Democrats in the Legislature this year. It passed on party-line votes in both chambers, which Democrats control by wide margins.
“This veto from Governor Polis is a betrayal of working people in Colorado, but also one we are not surprised about,” Wynn Howell, Colorado Working Families Party state director, said in a statement after the veto. “Given that he is one of the wealthiest men in Colorado, it is no shock that he is woefully out of touch with public opinion on this question.”
Howell called on Attorney General Phil Weiser and U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet, two Democrats in the race for Colorado governor next year, to weigh in on whether they would have signed the bill.
“Will Senator Bennet or AG Weiser stand with workers? Or will they just be more of the same stale and out of touch anti-worker politics in Colorado? Neither one has said publicly whether they would sign the Worker Protection Act, and at this point their silence is deafening. We urge them to answer that question clearly and unambiguously,” they wrote.
Business groups applauded the veto.
“CCA members value the voice of their employees,” Colorado Contractors Association President and CEO Tony Milo said in a statement. “It is of utmost importance to ensure their voices count when it comes to deducting union dues from their paychecks. The Governor did the right thing today for workers across Colorado.”

(Kate Kealey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)TOPEKA — Fuel shortages in Kansas, Iowa and Nebraska spurred a federal agency to issue an emergency declaration this week that gives leeway to commercial drivers hauling fuel.
The emergency order by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Association extended an April 30 state of disaster emergency proclamation from Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly. The state-level declaration expired on May 13, said Linda Berry, spokesperson for the Kansas Corporation Commission, which regulates gas and oil production in the state.
Areas in Kansas and surrounding states are experiencing a fuel shortage, causing long lines at fuel stations, delivery delays and a need for truck drivers to increase the number of hours they can drive to deliver fuel, said an April 30 press release. The short-term changes only apply to drivers who are part of the fuel delivery system.
Under the declaration, drivers can temporarily work longer hours to ensure fuel supplies are going through, the release said.
“This declaration is in response to the widespread fuel shortages in affected states impacting agricultural operations and the national food supply, and their effects on people and property, including immediate threats to human life, public safety, or public welfare,” the federal declaration said.
Berry said planned pipeline and refinery maintenance and higher demands among farmers and drivers during planting season were likely sources of the supply chain disruption.

(Photo by Diyosa Carter/Getty Images)A federal judge has again temporarily blocked portions of an Iowa law aimed at restricting schools’ recognition of LGBTQ+ people and banning books with sexual or LGBTQ+ content.
The law, which was signed by Gov. Kim Reynolds in May 2023, was immediately challenged by Lambda Legal and ACLU of Iowa on behalf of students, teachers and the organization Iowa Safe Schools.
As originally written, the law prohibits school districts and educators from providing “any program, curriculum, test, survey, questionnaire, promotion, or instruction relating to gender identity or sexual orientation to students in kindergarten through grade six.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The court had previously enjoined the law because the terms “gender identity” and “sexual orientation” were defined so broadly as to make it impossible for a reasonable school district, teacher, or student to understand what, exactly, was prohibited.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit vacated the district court’s injunction and remanded the case with instructions to the district court to address the legality of a narrower interpretation of the law.
Thursday’s preliminary injunction reflects the district court’s conclusion that there are parts of the law that do pass constitutional muster, but only under such a narrow interpretation.
“The restrictions on ‘programs’ and ‘promotion’ relating to gender identity and sexual orientation cannot reasonably be interpreted in a manner consistent with the First Amendment,” U.S. District Court Judge Stephen Locher ruled. “The words ‘program’ and ‘promotion’ are simply too broad to refer only to mandatory classroom curriculum and instead prohibit school districts and educators from, among other things, making extracurricular activities relating to gender identity and sexual orientation available to students in grade 6 or below. These restrictions therefore violate students’ First Amendment rights and are facially unconstitutional.”
In his ruling, Locher set out what precisely what portions of the law are, and are not, enforceable:
— Detailed instruction banned: School districts and educators may not provide mandatory lessons or instruction to students in grade 6 or below that include detailed explanations or normative views on “gender identity” or “sexual orientation.”
— Neutral references allowed: School districts and teachers may provide mandatory lessons or instruction to students in grade 6 or below that contain neutral references to gender identity or sexual orientation. The lessons and instruction simply cannot focus on those topics. Teachers may make other neutral references to any gender identity and any sexual orientation during classroom instruction — for example, by referring to their partner even if the individual is of the same sex.
— Student groups allowed: Students in grades 6 and below must be allowed to join Gender Sexuality Alliances, or GSAs, and other student groups related to gender identity and/or sexual orientation.
— Promotion of student groups allowed: School districts and educators must be permitted to advertise GSAs and other student groups that relate to gender identity or sexual orientation to all students, including those in grade six and below, to the same degree as they might promote any other student group.
— Parental notification allowed in some cases: State officials and school districts may inform parents when a student asks for an accommodation in the form of a pronoun that’s at odds with their gender listed in school records, but they may not do so to any other student requests for an accommodation.
“We’re pleased that our clients, Iowa families and students, can look forward to the next school year without facing the harms of this unconstitutional law,” said Nathan Maxwell, senior attorney at Lambda Legal. “This ruling acknowledges that Iowa students and teachers have experienced real harm from this law. The court agreed with us that the latitude afforded the state to determine school curricula does not empower lawmakers to erase any mention of LGBTQ+ people altogether from schools, nor to put students in harm’s way for failing to meet ambiguous and arbitrary standards for gender expression. Lastly, the court here makes it clear, yet again, that banning books with LGBTQ+ content or censoring inclusive messages for LGBTQ+ students is unacceptable.”
“This is an important win for our clients and others harmed by this overreaching law,” said Thomas Story, ACLU of Iowa staff attorney. “The federal district court has blocked the state from enforcing many of the worst aspects of Senate File 496. Under this order, Iowa teachers no longer can be disciplined simply because their classroom contains a Pride flag or their library contains books with LGBTQ+ characters. Students of all ages are once again free to join GSAs and to promote them to their classmates.”

Why it’s still controversial,Carolyn Jones,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/k-12-education/2025/05/graduation-regalia-california/,Many school districts require students to undergo a lengthy process if they want to wear tribal or other cultural regalia at graduation. A new bill would eliminate those obstacles.,"In summary
Many school districts require students to undergo a lengthy process if they want to wear tribal or other cultural regalia at graduation. A new bill would eliminate those obstacles.


Eight years ago, California passed a law requiring high schools to allow students to wear eagle feathers, abalone necklaces and other regalia at graduations. 
But so many schools — more than half, by one estimation — have thrown up roadblocks to implementing the law that one lawmaker has brought the issue back to the Legislature. 
“It’s very disappointing that even after all this time, some districts still aren’t compliant,” said Assemblyman James Ramos, a Democrat from San Bernardino, who’s sponsoring the current bill. “We hope this bill gets us where we need to be.”
Ramos’ bill, AB 1369, eliminates the pre-approval process for students seeking to wear any type of cultural regalia at graduations, Native American or otherwise. Fifty-six percent of high schools allow students to wear regalia but only if they get advance permission, sometimes weeks before the ceremony, according to a 2024 study by the American Civil Liberties Union and California Indian Legal Services.
Schools say they need a pre-approval process — for all students, not just Native American students — because they want to ensure graduation adornments are respectful and appropriate. Students of other backgrounds also occasionally opt for adornments, such as kente cloths, and have to undergo the same approval process.

The bill, which passed the Assembly and is now working its way through the Senate, applies to any form of cultural regalia, although its definition of “cultural” is vague: “Cultural means recognized practices and traditions of a certain group of people.” That ambiguity is why a pre-approval process is necessary, some school districts say.
Native students, their families and tribes say it should be their decision as to what’s appropriate tribal attire, not the school district’s. They also say the approval process is too far in advance of the ceremony; often, students receive their regalia on the day of the event, sometimes as a gift from a grandparent or tribal elder. Showing up at graduation unsure of whether you’ll be allowed to wear a cherished piece of regalia can be nerve-wracking and embarrassing, Native students have said.
‘Proud to be Native’
Jennie Rocha, a freshman at Oregon State University, said she was nervous last year when she arrived at her graduation ceremony at Clovis North High wearing a Comanche stole that the school had initially denied.
The stole, provided by the tribal headquarters in Oklahoma, was inscribed with “we the people” in English and Comanche. When Rocha first applied for approval to wear it, she was denied. But after her father complained to the school board and local media reported on the dispute, the school granted approval.      
“I wanted to wear it because I feel like everything I have is because of the Comanche. I wouldn’t be able to go to college without their support,” Rocha said. “I’m proud to be Native and I wanted to show that.” 
Although there may have been delays and initial denials, Clovis Unified hasn’t ultimately stopped a student from wearing cultural adornments at graduation, said district spokesperson Kelly Avants. The district stands by its approval process as a way to minimize disruptions on the day of the graduation and screen out potentially offensive adornments.
Not having an approval process “creates an extremely vulnerable position for school districts and hinders the ability of staff to protect students from the trauma that comes from cultural appropriation, or a situation where someone intending to mock or harm a race or culture is able to do so because school administrators are not allowed to validate adornments,” Avants said in an email.

In Rocha’s case, the district initially denied the request because staff weren’t clear on personal elements of the stole and wanted to check with Comanche tribal leaders, Avants said. That caused a delay before the district ultimately approved the stole, she said.
The Association of California School Administrators hasn’t taken a position on Ramos’ bill, but their attorneys apparently agree with Clovis’ stand. 
“Districts have to have some parameters, otherwise you’re going to end up with a free-for-all on the night of graduation,” attorney Sloan Simmons said in an April podcast advising the state’s school administrators. “That’s the only rational way to handle this.”
The California Department of Education formed a task force to study the issue. The task force was supposed to create a report for the Legislature by April 2023, but it hasn’t yet. Meanwhile, the Department of Education is advising school districts to consult with local tribes if they opt to have a pre-approval process for regalia.
Trump’s anti-DEI orders
Another potential barrier to graduation regalia is President Donald Trump’s announcement in February that the federal government would withhold school funding to districts that have diversity policies and programs, specifically mentioning graduation ceremonies. A judge temporarily blocked the order last month, saying it was overly vague, and California more recently filed a separate lawsuit to stop the order. 
Meanwhile, confusion persists over any school policy that singles out or gives special treatment to a particular ethnic group.
Heather Hostler, executive director of California Indian Legal Services and a member of the Hoopa Valley tribe in Humboldt County, said she’s not worried about Ramos’ bill defying Trump’s order because recognized tribes are sovereign nations over which the federal government has no authority, she said.
The push for tribal regalia started as a way to tout the accomplishments of Native students, whose graduation rate — 80% — lags behind the state average of 87%. It’s also a way to strengthen Native culture by raising awareness and giving Native communities something to rally around, Ramos said.
“When someone graduates, it’s a big deal,” Ramos said. “The whole tribal community comes together. It makes sense that you’d be gifted something for your accomplishment.”
History of discrimination
Other recent laws, many by Ramos, have also addressed the treatment of Native Americans in K-12 schools. One law bans Native American school mascots. Another updates history curriculum to include the genocide of Native Californians. 
These laws are meant to help reverse more than a century of discrimination against Native students in California schools, said Morning Star Gali, founder and executive director of Indigenous Justice, an advocacy group.
Until the 1970s, many Native young people were sent to boarding schools where they were forced to abandon their language and culture. History curriculum often glamorizes the Mission and Gold Rush eras, when Native tribes suffered devastating losses.

In light of that, wearing tribal regalia at graduations “should not be a contentious issue,” Gali said. “Our young people deserve to walk with dignity and pride. To deny them that is a continued form of cultural extermination.”
Ethan Molina, a senior at Clovis West High School and a member of the Pascua Yaqui tribe, got district approval to wear an eagle feather on his mortarboard at graduation next month. The feather was a gift at a recent powwow. 
But he did not get permission to wear a sash embroidered by his aunt for the occasion. The sash reads “Class of 2025,” sewn in burgundy, blue, orange and red, significant colors for the tribe.
“I was confused,” Molina said. “It’s not political or anything. I didn’t really get why they’d deny it.”
His mother complained to the district and they’re waiting to hear a response. Meanwhile, Molina is just eager to graduate.
“I’m happy I get to wear the eagle feather,” he said. “But I’m also pretty excited about leaving school.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/051425-Native-American-Regalia-LV-CM-08.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-16 18:06:38.105821

In a May 9 letter from the National Institute of Standards and Technology, Darren Olson, the institute’s grants management officer, said the president determined that the Digital Equity Capacity Program was created and administered using “unconstitutional racial preferences.”The Vermont Community Broadband Board is exploring legal options to oppose the cancellation and has contacted the State Attorney General’s Office, according to its website.“Without targeted investments in digital access and literacy, many Vermonters will be unable to access the resources necessary for job training, career advancement, and economic mobility, ultimately deepening existing disparities and limiting opportunities for economic growth,” the board’s digital equity officer, Britaney Watson, said in the release.Vermont’s implementation of the Digital Equity Act, passed under the Biden administration, would provide devices for people facing financial barriers, as well as online training programs to prepare Vermonters for remote work. The program would have also awarded subgrants to local organizations working to provide internet accessibility throughout the state, according to the release.A Sept. 30th study by the Center on Rural Innovation found that rural areas with higher broadband adoption and more small broadband service providers have stronger, more dynamic local economies. They reported that rural counties with fiber broadband adoption rates of over 80% have significant advantages over those with low adoption, including 213% higher business growth, higher self-employment growth, GDP growth and per capita income growth.The broadband board said in the release that it will continue to work with the Vermont Attorney General’s Office and Vermont’s congressional delegation to determine their next legal, political and programmatic steps in continuing their digital equity efforts. Read the story on VTDigger here:  Federal government cancels Vermont’s $5.3 million digital equity grant.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/womens-rally-9-20241102-1024x676.jpg,,,2025-05-16 18:06:38.105821

It’s the latest move by the gun-rights group in its four-year-battle to override the 2018 Florida law that bans 18-to-20-year-olds from purchasing long guns.
The full U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit denied the legal challenge by the NRA in March, two years after a three-judge panel similarly ruled against the organization. The Florida Legislature passed and then-Gov. Rick Scott signed the law shortly after the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland that killed 17 people.
Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier said after that ruling that his office would not defend the law if in fact the NRA filed an appeal with the high court.
“Notwithstanding CA11’s opinion today, I believe restricting the right of law-abiding adults to purchase firearms is unconstitutional,” Uthmeier said on X on March 14, adding that the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals recently reached the same conclusion. “Men and women old enough to fight and die for our country should be able to purchase firearms to defend themselves and their families.”
The NRA’s petition for certiorari calls upon the justices to review the split among federal circuit courts over whether adults under 21 enjoy Second Amendment rights. The Third, Fifth, and Eighth Circuits have ruled that they do, while the Tenth and Eleventh circuits have upheld laws banning firearm purchases by adults under 21.
The Florida House in March passed a bill (HB 759) that would lower the age for individuals in Florida to purchase shotguns and rifles from 21 to 18. It was the third straight year the chamber has done so, but both times the legislation failed to be come law because the proposal never moved in the Florida Senate.

Most of the clients had gone to work.Rows of double bunk beds packed two tight rooms with yellow walls and low ceilings at 187 Church St. One room provides 28 beds for single male adults and the other has eight beds available for female adults, and there are a couple of bathrooms with showers. Each of the beds has a number that corresponds to a locker in the hallway. There is a common area downstairs with some chairs, tables, two washer-dryers, a TV and a makeshift kitchen.Makeshift is how the shelter has operated for four decades, while homelessness and the need for safe, temporary housing has only grown.In the last federal fiscal year (October 2023 – September 2024), the Waystation, as the night shelter is called, served 159 unique individuals. Jonathan Farrell, executive director of the nonprofit that provides a wide array of housing and shelter services and advocates for long-term solutions to end homelessness, said 30 of those individuals were chronically homeless.“We are seeing unprecedented numbers of folks who are unhoused and sleeping rough in our communities,” he said.With 2,500 square feet over two floors, the night shelter has long outgrown the space in a city and state that has continued to see more and more people experiencing homelessness.Jonathan Farrell, the executive director of the Committee on Temporary Shelter, at the COTS Waystation shelter in Burlington on Friday, May 16. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerVermont’s rate of homelessness ranks fourth in the nation and increased by nearly 5% between early 2023 and early 2024, according to the most recent annual point-in-time count, a federally-mandated tally of unhoused people taken on one night in January. Over the last few years, state leaders have restricted Vermont’s motel voucher program, limiting the back-up shelter option as homelessness has grown. Meanwhile, a bill that could overhaul Vermont’s response to homelessness is making its way through the Legislature.In Chittenden County alone, there are “a solid 250 to 300” who are unhoused, Farrell estimated.While the Waystation has been a lifeline for many seeking shelter at night, the aging facility does not meet current needs and has been on COTS’ agenda for improvement. In January, the organization acquired 58 Pearl St. — the former social security building -– and  work has begun to create a more modern, spacious, ADA-compliant night shelter there, Farrell said.The 7,361 square foot property will triple the space available in the current Waystation and provide beds for up to 56 adults, allowing COTS to expand its shelter services by 55%, according to a recent press release.“We are really focused on the dignity of the space,” Farrell said.To do so, COTS needs money.Renovating the building, in partnership with Duncan Wisniewski Architecture and JA Morrissey Construction, is estimated to cost $2 million, the release states. COTS’ capital campaign for a new Waystation has raised $500,000 from the State of Vermont Office of Economic Opportunity and $600,000 from anonymous donors. The Hoehl Family Foundation has provided a $200,000 challenge grant and COTS is looking to raise another $200,000 in matching funds to open the new space.The Hoefl grant has donated the first $100,000 and plans to match it with a second $100,000 once the additional $200,000 has been raised, according to the release.“It’s not charity, it’s solidarity,” said Katharine Kostin, a Hoehl Family Foundation board member, in the release. “We believe we’re only as strong as our most vulnerable neighbors; therefore, we’re privileged to work with the community toward supporting the dignity of every person.”Besides providing critically needed beds and space, the new center will provide a better kitchen, more laundry options, six private bathrooms with showers, a break room, common areas, an office and intake space for community partners and service providers.“It could be a health care provider, a street outreach person, could be an EMT or a nurse to see one of our guests in a private setting for medical, mental health, really anything. So we’re really excited about that and partnering with other folks in the community to provide those services to our guests,” Farrell said.In addition to providing a safe, supportive environment, Farrell said the new Waystation will have a positive impact on downtown by providing 20 more beds. So “contributing to the Waystation campaign is a direct, tangible way for people in our community who want to be part of the solution to do so,” he said.“Our downtown is facing a crisis,” states a May 9 letter signed by more than 100 area businesses and sent to Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak. The letter cites “street harassment, visible drug use, and threatening behavior” among the reasons they say have contributed to less foot traffic and staff retention leading to recent closures. Businesses are increasingly having to work on managing overdoses, mental health issues, shoplifting and cleaning up downtown, the letter states, urging the city to do better with communication, security, cleanliness and restorative efforts.The former Wilson Hotel in Burlington houses the Committee on Temporary Shelter ’s (COTS) Waystation shelter and transitional housing.

The red brick building it abuts houses 23 deeply affordable permanent housing rooms for low-income and formerly unhoused individuals. Many of the tenants have been there for more than two decades, although the average turnaround is about 7 years, according to Farrell.Originally home of the Mills brothers who published Burlington’s first newspaper — The Northern Sentinel -– and dominated the printing and publishing market in the first half of the 19th century, the building later housed a hotel. A faded blue sign -– The Wilson — still hangs off the corner of the red brick building, built around 1820. Inside, there are elaborate textured tin ceilings and exposed copper piping harkening to a bygone era.Open 5 p.m. to 8 a.m., the Waystation is much older than the organization that was started by volunteers in 1982. COTS acquired it to use as a shelter soon after with two early board members putting their own homes up as collateral, according to Farrell.On Thursday morning, some of the blankets on the double bunk beds in a cramped room were rumpled; some were neatly folded and set on pillows. And some of the grey-blue lockers in the hallway sported stickers: ‘I (red heart) Jesus’ and ‘Owl forest.’Most of their temporary owners will return to lay their heads down. Unlike the stereotypes that persist, more than 70% of them have day jobs, Farrell said. And many of them, he said, are looking forward to the new, improved Pearl Street Waystation, which is expected to open in December.Read the story on VTDigger here:  COTS seeks public help to fund new, expanded overnight adult shelter in Burlington.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/COTS-waystation-3-20250516-1024x676.jpg,,,2025-05-16 18:06:38.105821

A recent move by Doña Ana County to sever ties with a troubled Southern NM utility prompted Kenney to applaud the statement and urge further changes to the utility. (Danielle Prokop / Source NM)New Mexico’s top environmental official made the rare move this week of wielding political capital instead of regulatory power, saying he has little confidence in a troubled water provider in the southern part of the state that has been dogged by ongoing violations in arsenic levels.
Environment Secretary James Kenney urged the city of Sunland Park to follow the lead of surrounding Doña Ana County and sever ties with the Camino Real Regional Utility Authority. An independent, third party should oversee the utility in the meantime, Kenney said.
“We’re weighing in at this point because we’ve had it,” Kenney told Source NM, and acknowledged that it is unusual for the state to speak on a water supplier’s governance. “While we’re exhausting our enforcement, our legal approaches, we have another approach: We have to speak about it.”
He encouraged the restructuring of the utility at the local level, saying the state has limited tools to address the chronic issues at CRRUA.
“We can continue to assess civil penalties, collect those civil penalties, take them to court, but it is difficult to sort of seek an injunction and say, ‘You’re no longer allowed to operate,’ because that means the community is without water for any purpose, including things like fire suppression,” Kenney said.
CRRUA serves approximately 19,000 people in the border city of Sunland Park, Santa Theresa and the southernmost portion of Doña Ana County, an area with naturally occurring high levels of arsenic in the groundwater. Sunland Park and Doña Ana County jointly operate the utility, which is governed by a seven-member board.
The area has long struggled with arsenic – which over the long term can cause cancer and skin lesions – in drinking water, with health reports and concerns over treatment plants ongoing for nearly a decade.
State investigators intervened following a series of water quality issues in November 2023.The New Mexico Environment Department found that CRRUA sent drinking water with arsenic to residents’ homes while its three arsenic treatment systems were “offline and bypassed” for more than a year, in addition to dozens of significant treatment, training and facility issues.
State officials say Doña Ana Co. water had ‘systemic failures by management’

CRRUA is facing an ongoing lawsuit for alleged civil rights violations in state district court, and is also scheduled for a June 17 public hearing in Santa Fe regarding its protest of NMED’s $251,580 fines.
In media releases and prior statements to Source NM, CRRUA officials said they have worked to reduce arsenic levels and continue repeating that water is safe to drink. Specifically, CRRUA reported on May 5 that it has addressed 98% of the issues raised in the December 2023 report.
CRRUA said recent tests showing arsenic levels above the limit at one treatment plant were found as part of its voluntary testing.
“These follow-up tests are for internal monitoring and public transparency only. They are not for compliance purposes,” CRRUA Executive director Juan Crosby said in a press release Thursday. “Only the quarterly tests NMED conducts are for compliance and according to the latest compliance tests, the Santa Teresa Industrial ATF remains NMED compliant.”
Kenney said CRRUA can simultaneously be improving on the past violations, improving training and monitoring but also failing to restore the water quality.
“But at the end of the day, the only metric that matters is the quality of the water and the safety of that water getting into people’s houses,” Kenney said.
Past and recent arsenic level violations
No known safe level of exposure to inorganic arsenic exists, but the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has a health-based limit on drinking water at 10 parts per billion.
On April 29, CRRUA reported an arsenic level of 12 parts per billion at the Santa Teresa Industrial Park plant. One week later, in a separate test shared with NMED, the same plant reported another violation of 12 parts per billion on May 6.
Kenney endorsed recommendations from community organizations asking for a health assessment and to supply arsenic testing strips or potentially additional sources of water.
In a May 7 press release, CRRUA said it would not provide test strips because it would violate the state’s anti-donation clause and that test strips contain “hazardous materials that require proper handling.”
Kenney said that “demonstrated an inability to understand the magnitude of the problem.”
“I don’t know why the concern about a one-time exposure to a test strip that may contain mercury is CRRUA’s greater concern than the arsenic in the water that’s hitting people’s homes,” Kenney said.
Daisy Maldonado, who has organized in the community at the nonprofit Empowerment Congress of Doña Ana County, told Source NM she was surprised, but welcomed NMED’s endorsement of the recent demands the group issued to CRRUA.
“I would put it back on Secretary Kenney and if CRRUA says they cannot provide those types of services, then we’re going to look obviously to NMED to be a partner in providing funding for test strips, third-party water and that health assessment,” Maldonando said.
She said the opportunity to reshape CRRUA over the next four years will offer an opportunity for Empowerment Congress to build a utility that’s more responsive to residents.
“A new structure should be established that really serves, again, the community,” Maldonado said. “That the highest priority is safe, clean drinking water water that people can trust.”
CRRUA next steps likely to take years
Earlier this week, Doña Ana County took the first step in a yearslong process to separate itself from CRRUA’s current governance.
At the May 13 meeting, after an hour-and-a-half closed session, the Doña Ana Board of County Commissioners unanimously voted to send immediate notice to Sunland Park to start the termination process of the Joint Powers Agreement, a formal charter allowing multiple public bodies to work together. The agreement, renewed last year, requires either one of the parties to give four years notice.
Blame spirals as CRRUA governing record ‘misplaced’ and never sent to state

On Friday, Doña Ana County Commission Chair Christopher Schaljo-Hernandez told Source NM that the vote is a first step to force negotiations and correct customer dissatisfaction. He said the current agreement overrepresents Sunland Park on the board, and that termination is the only way to renegotiate the makeup of CRRUA’s governing board.
Schaljo-Hernandez emphasized that CRRUA will continue operating in the meantime, and that negotiations will begin very soon.
“We’re going to work towards making sure that every single person serviced by CRRUA has their water quality improved,” Schaljo-Hernandez said. “The county has the vision that we’re going to improve this for all users. We’re not saying to Sunland Park ‘we’re taking ours and you’re taking yours, good luck.’”
Sunland Park Mayor Javier Perea told Source NM in a phone call that it’s too early to determine what the city will do, but did not commit to cutting ties with CRRUA.
“I don’t know what it will look like today or tomorrow,” Perea said. “No plans have been developed yet, this is still very early on in the process.”
When asked about recent arsenic level violations, Perea said he believes the utility is making progress.
“The steps that we’re taking are working and being able to detect these issues and we’re trying to correct it as soon as possible, rather than having to wait for the required state testing,” he said. “The utility has made its stride over the last year, but there’s still a lot of work to be done.”
Further, Perea said more funding is needed for a successful water utility, not just form rate-payers, but from the state and federal government.
“This was done on the back of infrastructure in Sunland Park, and we haven’t received our fair share of funding in this part of the state,” he said. “I hope that in this process, the state can also have funding opportunities for us to tap into and address these issues that have existed or been deferred for a long time.”
The New Mexico Department of Finance and Administration secretary is required to approve all joint powers agreements, including any modifications.
In a statement Henry Valdez, the director of legislative affairs at DFA, said the secretary’s approval is “limited to reviewing for compliance to ensure the terms and conditions are applicable,” and that any amendments or modifications to an agreement would require the secretary’s approval.

Conservative Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas dissented.“Under these circumstances, notice roughly 24 hours before removal, devoid of information about how to exercise due process rights to contest that removal, surely does not pass muster,” according to the decision.The justices did not determine the legality of the Trump administration using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans 14 and older with suspected ties to the gang Tren de Aragua.On his social media platform, Trump expressed his disapproval of the ruling.“THE SUPREME COURT WON’T ALLOW US TO GET CRIMINALS OUT OF OUR COUNTRY!” he wrote on Truth Social.The justices found that the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals “erred in dismissing the detainees’ appeal for lack of jurisdiction,” and vacated that order, sending the case back.The Trump administration on Monday asked the high court to remove the injunction, arguing that detaining suspected members of Tren de Aragua poses a threat to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and staff.In a Wednesday response, the American Civil Liberties Union, which brought the suit, warned that if the Supreme Court lifts its injunction, “most of the putative class members will be removed with little chance to seek judicial review.”In Friday’s order, the justices noted that because the Trump administration has used the Alien Enemies Act to send migrants to a notorious prison in El Salvador, careful due process is needed.“The Government has represented elsewhere that it is unable to provide for the return of an individual deported in error to a prison in El Salvador…where it is alleged that detainees face indefinite detention,” according to the order, noting the wrongful deportation of Maryland man Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador.“The detainees’ interests at stake are accordingly particularly weighty,” the court continued.Other rulingsOn April 18, the ACLU made an emergency application to the high court, asking to bar any removals under the Alien Enemies Act in the Northern District of Texas over concerns that the Trump administration was not following due process.Several federal judges elsewhere have blocked the use of the wartime law in their districts that cover Colorado, Southern Texas and Southern New York.A federal judge in Western Pennsylvania Tuesday was the first to uphold the Trump administration’s use of the Alien Enemies Act, but said those accused must have at least three weeks to challenge their removal.",,,,2025-05-16 18:06:38.105821

“In light of the current administration’s stated priorities on efficiency and reducing waste, we believe that maintaining the integrity of established monument boundaries supports those goals,” Nygren wrote in a letter to Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum, according to a post by the Navajo leader on X. “Changing the boundaries and reopening finalized planning processes would not only risk the loss of valuable progress but may also lead to inefficiencies, duplicative expenditures, and delays in implementing conservation strategies.”
The letter asks that no changes to the monuments’ sizes be made without a meaningful dialogue with “all tribal nations with ancestral ties to these lands.”

In his confirmation hearing, Burgum hinted at support for reducing the monuments and echoed Utah leaders’ criticism of use of the Antiquities Act to put protections on large areas of land.
Bears Ears has deep spiritual and cultural importance to a number of Indigenous peoples, including the Diné, or Navajo, Nygren said in his post, noting that like neighboring Grand Staircase it is a “revered landscape.”
The monuments in southeastern Utah have been a political football for multiple presidential administrations, starting with the establishment of Grand Staircase in 1996 by President Bill Clinton who used his power under the Antiquities Act, a law passed in 1906 that gives the president authority to declare national monuments to protect areas of cultural, historical and scientific significance.
President Barack Obama then used the Antiquities Act at the end of his term in 2016 to give monument status to Bears Ears, an area tribes had long lobbied to protect.
Both monuments were scaled back by President Donald Trump when he took office in 2017, cutting Bears Ears from 1.36 million acres to 1 million acres, and Grand Staircase-Escalante from 1.35 million acres to 229,000 acres.
In 2021, President Joe Biden restored the monuments to their original sizes, a decision Utah is challenging in court.
Meanwhile, polling indicates that 71% of voters favor maintaining Bears Ears as a national monument, while 74% support keeping Grand Staircase-Escalante as a national monument.

(Photo by Jim Peaco/Yellowstone National Park)Yellowstone National Park wildlife staff trapped and euthanized a grizzly bear this week after a series of conflicts with human food sources and trash in the park’s most popular tourist areas.
According to a Wednesday press release from the park, the 11-year-old, male grizzly bear, estimated to weigh 400 pounds, had repeatedly sought out food sources near Old Faithful, the Nez Perce Picnic Area and the Midway Geyser Basin parking lot.
The griz developed a strategy to flip over 800-pound dumpsters, uprooted small bear-resistant trash cans from their concrete bases and “became increasingly food-conditioned,” which wildlife managers decided posed a safety risk in such a busy area fo the park. The decisions to euthanize the animal was made to ensure public safety and reduce the chances of other bears becoming habituated to human food.
“It’s unfortunate that this bear began regularly seeking out garbage and was able to defeat the park’s bear-resistant infrastructure,” Yellowstone Bear Management Biologist Kerry Gunther said in a press release. “We go to great lengths to protect bears and prevent them from becoming conditioned to human food. But occasionally, a bear outsmarts us or overcomes our defenses. When that happens, we sometimes have to remove the bear from the population to protect visitors and property.”

The last grizzly bear killed in a management action in Yellowstone was in the fall of 2017, when park officials removed a griz that was damaging tents and accessing human food in backcountry campsites near Heart lake.
Yellowstone National Park’s bear management plan provides bear-resistant food storage lockers in all campgrounds, food storage devices in all backcountry campsites, and bear-resistant garbage cans and lockers. Park officials remind all visitors that utilizing these bear safety measures remain crucial in ensuring public safety, and preventing wildlife from developing dangerous habits.
All of Yellowstone is bear country, from the trails in the park’s backcountry to the boardwalks and parking lots around Old Faithful. Visitor safety cannot be guaranteed, but visitors can play an active role in protecting themselves and the bears people come here to enjoy.
Park staff ask that anyone involved in a conflict with a bear, regardless of how minor, contact park officials or report it to a park ranger as soon as possible. If cell service is available, dial 911. The lives of other people, and the bear, may depend on it.

Among the violators:
Grundy Care Center, Grundy: In January, the home was cited for failing to protect residents from mental and physical abuse. Inspectors reported that a nurse aide at the home had accepted money from a male resident, and had kissed, touched, and sent nude photos of herself via text to the man. The inappropriate interactions continued until the nurse aide resigned, inspectors determined. The resident told inspectors the aide had wanted him to move in with her so she could take care of him.
The administrator of the home later learned the relationship was sexual, with conduct occurring during and after the aide’s scheduled working hours. The nurse aide reportedly admitted that after she met the resident, the two exchanged phone numbers and she followed him on social media and would message him via text and Facebook Messenger. She allegedly said it evolved into a relationship and that “neither did something the other didn’t want.” She reportedly acknowledged the inappropriate physical touching happened during her working hours, but added, “It was just kissing, that’s all.”
The matter was referred to the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services by the police. According to state inspectors, DHHS “rejected the report and closed the case.”
Greater Southside Health and Rehabilitation, Des Moines: In January, a male resident’s son alerted the home to misappropriation of property. The resident’s son had installed a camera in his father’s room, which captured footage of a certified nurse aide entering the room at 2 a.m. while the resident slept and accessing a locked drawer containing the resident’s money. Later, it appeared $55 was missing from the drawer. The administrator confirmed for state inspectors that he watched the video and it was evident the worker unlocked the dresser with a key, picked up something and put it in her pocket.
Harmony Waterloo, formerly Promedica Skilled Nursing & Rehab, Waterloo: Earlier this month, this home was cited for failing to protect residents from abuse in the form of financial exploitation. Residents of the home reported they routinely gave the staff money, credit cards or debit cards to purchase pop for them from vending machines. After one resident was discharged, she received a phone call from her bank regarding a debit card payment for a $417 cellphone bill, which depleted her account. It was later determined the phone in question belonged to a nurse aide who worked at the facility. A check of that aide’s criminal history revealed a past charge of third-degree theft that had resulted in a deferred judgment.










If you bite me, I will knock all the teeth out of your mouth.


– Registered nurse at Lakeside Lutheran Home in Emmetsburg, according to inspectors


Lakeside Lutheran Home, Emmetsburg: In February, this facility was cited for failing to protect residents from abuse. Workers alleged that a registered nurse had tried to check a male resident’s blood sugar and after the man attempted to bite the nurse, she told him, “If you bite me, I will knock all the teeth out of your mouth,” and then raised her hand as if to strike him. An aide reported that she verbally intervened and said, “Hey,” and nurse lowered her hand.
Silver Oak Nursing & Rehab Center, Marion: In March, the home was cited for failing to report the exploitation of a resident and the potential misappropriation of the resident’s medication. According to inspectors, one registered nurse at the home was responsible for administering the resident’s medication commonly used for erectile dysfunction, and 21 to 33 tablets were unaccounted for. The resident indicated he had tipped the nurse $5 or $10 for her birthday and that on occasion, he had kissed the nurse and believed he was in love with her.
Staff members had reported seeing the two hugging and kissing. A medication aide reported seeing the two together and seeing the nurse stick her tongue “down his throat,” and also indicated the nurse may have given the resident money for a phone. A county deputy later told an inspector that a backpack owned by the nurse contained a prescription-drug label for an erectile dysfunction drug that indicated it was prescribed to the resident in question. Inspectors concluded the home made no effort to separate the nurse from the resident while the medication issue and exploitation issue were investigated.
Southeast Iowa Regional Medical Center’s Klein Center, West Burlington: In April, this facility was cited for failing to report allegations of abuse. A nurse aide at the home had reported to administrators that another worker at the home had confronted a resident who had expressed concern for a fellow resident’s welfare, telling him not to worry about others and to “sit your f—ing a– down.”
The accused worker was also reported by another worker to have called a resident a “b—-” on many occasions. In one alleged incident, a resident was being showered by the accused worker and complained the water was too hot, to which the worker replied, “Shut the f— up.”
Tripoli Nursing & Rehab Center, Tripoli: In April, the home was cited for three staff members being verbally abusive or physically rough with residents. One resident told inspectors, “I don’t like the way (other residents) are being talked to. (The workers) have no compassion. They talk to them very demanding… It is not ethical. We are family here.” Another resident said one of the workers was upset with a colleague and so “she just kind of threw me in bed or pushed me in bed.” The resident said the staffer was rough with him but that he didn’t consider it abuse.
Rehabilitation Centers of Independence, West Campus, Independence: In April, this facility was cited for failing to report abuse. A former resident of the facility had reported that that he had transferred $22 to one of the home’s nurse aides via PayPal at the end of February, and had only been paid back $10.

House Bill 3532 aims to speed the process of removing offensive titles from remaining sites. (Julia Shumway/Oregon Capital Chronicle)Oregon lawmakers aim to speed up the process for renaming dozens of creeks, lakes, mountains and other sites that still hold offensive names.
The Oregon Senate will soon take up House Bill 3532, which would have the Oregon Geographic Names Board — a group advised by the Oregon Historical Society — make a list of places with offensive geographic names within three years of the bill’s passage and determine new names in consultation with local governments and tribes.
Currently, anyone can send a suggestion to the board to rename a location. But it’s a lengthy process, Oregon Historical Society Kerry Tymchuk told the Oregon Capital Chronicle. After receiving a renaming suggestion, the board must tour the area, study its history and connect with tribes, local elected officials and landowners for their feedback, he said. Name changes ultimately require federal approval, too.
The Oregon Historical Society has already identified 107 locations across Oregon with offensive names that remain unchanged. Many of them include derogatory terms used to demean Black individuals, immigrants and Native American women — such as Squaw Creek in Douglas County, Chinaman Hat in Josephine County and Cannibal Mountain in Lincoln County.
The Oregon House already advanced the bill in a 45-3 vote. The Senate may approve the bill in the coming days or weeks before reaching the governor’s desk.
 As Trump admin prioritizes ‘American Greatness,’ Oregon bill honors Indigenous history

Oregon is no outlier for having locations with derogatory names. In recent years, lawmakers in Texas, Maine and California have also tried passing legislation to rename places with offensive titles.
These state-level efforts gained momentum after the Biden administration in 2021 created a commission to remove offensive names from federal lands and declared the word “squaw” derogatory. It replaced 650 locations with that term with names honoring Native American history and culture.
But under the Trump administration, some U.S. lawmakers have doubts as to whether the federal government would approve name changes. In February, a Democratic Maine lawmaker withdrew a bill similar to Oregon’s, citing conflicting federal and local views, the Maine Morning Star reported.
The Maine lawmaker’s decision was based on President Donald Trump’s first day in office, when he issued an executive order overriding the U.S. Board of Geographic Names’ authority and called to rename the Gulf of Mexico to “Gulf of America” and revert the name of North America’s tallest peak, Denali, to Mount McKinley.
Denali means “the great one” in the Koyukon language, an Alaskan Native group that lives north of the peak. The federal government’s official name for it until 2015 was Mount McKinley — named after the country’s 25th President William McKinley who was from Ohio and had never visited or had ties to Alaska.
Oregon has taken steps to rename some of its geographic features with offensive titles. Most recently, the Oregon Geographic Names Board in September successfully led an effort to replace the names of two creeks that had racist terms used against Black individuals, the Oregonian reported.
Oregon’s House Bill 3532 builds on 2001 legislation led by then-Sen. Kate Brown to remove the word “squaw” from location names. Despite that legislation, the term is still used for dozens of Oregon locations. Brown, Oregon’s governor from 2015 to 2023, testified in support of the bill, saying the state has a lot more work to do to remove offensive, racist and derogatory names.
 Bill championed by Indigenous Oregon lawmakers

Indigenous women, like Rep. Tawna Sanchez, a Portland Democrat of Shoshone-Bannock, Ute, and Carrizo descent and the bill’s lead sponsor, said derogatory terms shouldn’t still exist on Oregon’s map.
“Renaming offensive locations in Oregon reflects our shared commitment to mutual respect, historical truth and creating a welcoming environment for all Oregonians,” Sanchez said. “My hope is that no one has to drive in any wonderful part of the state of Oregon and feel like they don’t belong there.”
Sanchez told the Capital Chronicle that the federal government would still have to approve the renaming of places with offensive titles.
The bill includes an amendment to uplift local control, she said, but for a name change to be approved, it would have to go through the Oregon Geographic Names Board. Then, the U.S. Board on Geographic Names makes the final call.
“Our hope is the federal government will act on the recommendation from the (Oregon board) that was made through a comprehensive process that reflects the will of Oregonians. Any result other than that would be pure politics,” Sanchez said.
The three Republicans who voted against the bill— Reps. Jami Cate of Lebanon, Virgle Osborne of Roseburg and Alek Skarlatos of Winston — did not explain their votes in the House and did not respond to Capital Chronicle.
Rep. Annessa Hartman, D-Gladstone, a cosponsor and member of the Snipe Clan of the Cayuga Nation, part of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, told her House colleagues that from a young age she’s known about the derogatory terms used against her and her community.
“It was up to us to just ignore them and just ignore the pain and the suffering that those words had caused to my people and our family,” she said on the House floor. “To see those still plastered across maps, rivers and street signs and now having my own children — I don’t want to continue that legacy of having them to just accept that that term is being used.”

(Photo obtained from Arkansas Division of Environmental Quality files)Russellville-based Denali announced Friday that it will stop depositing waste from chicken processing facilities in its Van Buren lagoon by the end of 2025.
The announcement came after dozens of Fort Smith-area residents spoke at a public hearing held by the Arkansas Division of Environmental Quality Thursday evening. Both residents and elected officials described how odors from the lagoon, and from Denali’s land application operations, had negatively affected their lives and businesses, and the region as a whole.
“Denali will discontinue bringing material to the storage facility this year,” Denali CEO Todd Mathes said in an emailed press release.
“Disposition of the material at the site will be determined after Dec. 31, 2025. Denali is currently executing its long-term plan for alternative storage capacity and long-term infrastructure solutions throughout the region, which will allow for the closure of the open-air facility in Crawford County,” Mathes said. “Working with regulatory officials to obtain permits and permit modifications are required in order to completely close the storage facility in a timely manner.”
Denali told the Advocate earlier this month that “we have not committed to an exact date,” citing the need to obtain additional storage and permits.
Denali said it would provide notifications to local officials before the lagoon is cleaned out. A previous clean-out of millions of gallons of sludge from the lagoon in 2024 led to dozens of complaints about odor to DEQ from Fort Smith residents.
However, the waste recycling company emphasized that Sebastian and Crawford counties remained “important operational areas” for Denali due to the number of food processors in the region. 
The press release did not address concerns of some critics about the volume of waste being applied to fields in the area nor how land applications were affecting residents living nearby.
Crawford County has one of the highest number of land application permits in the state, with at least eight. Most of the Crawford County permits are held by Denali. HydroAg Environmental is another permit holder.

SPRINGFIELD — On May 19, 1875, a Cook County jury handed down a verdict in a case concerning the health and welfare of Mary Lincoln, widow of the former president who had been assassinated a decade earlier.

After listening to only a single day of testimony, the 12 men on the jury signed the standard verdict form stating simply that they “are satisfied that said Mary Lincoln is insane, and is a fit person to be sent to a State Hospital for the Insane …”

The case had been brought to court by her surviving son, Robert Todd Lincoln, then just 31 years old and a successful practicing attorney in Chicago. At his request, the court ordered her committed to the Bellevue Place Sanitarium in Batavia, west of Chicago, and named him conservator of her estate for a period of one year, based on the finding that she was at the time incapable of managing her own affairs.

But Mrs. Lincoln would not spend a full year in the facility. With the help of two of her closest and only remaining friends, James and Myra Bradwell, of Chicago – and against the strong protests of Robert Lincoln – Mary Lincoln would be released after only four months to the custody of her sister in Springfield, Elizabeth Edwards.

The subject of Mary Lincoln’s mental health has long been the subject of public debate. Was she, in fact, a danger to herself and others, and was her son truly acting in her best interests? Or was Robert Lincoln, as his mother would sometimes allege, scheming to shove her aside in order to take over her money and property?

Now, 150 years after her commitment, a newly rediscovered collection of correspondence between Mrs. Lincoln and her friends and family – letters long assumed to have been lost or destroyed – shed new light on the nature of her illness as well as the nature of her relationships with the few friends and family she had left by that time.

[caption id=""attachment_67091"" align=""alignleft"" width=""289""] “The Dark Days of Abraham Lincoln’s Widow, As Revealed by Her Own Letters,” edited by Jason Emerson and published by Southern Illinois University Press.[/caption]

“The Dark Days of Abraham Lincoln’s Widow, As Revealed by Her Own Letters,” was compiled by historian Jason Emerson and was recently released by Southern Illinois University Press.

“People have always wondered if these missing letters, if they showed that, in fact, she was perfectly sane, that her son Robert did actually railroad her, bribe the judge and jury because he wanted to steal her money,” Emerson said in a podcast interview with Capitol News Illinois. “And they do not show that at all. They show that Mary thought that's what was happening – which, in my opinion, and the opinions of psychiatrists I've consulted – that was one of her delusions, that everyone was trying to steal her money, not just Robert.”

The book was actually first compiled a century ago by Myra Helmer Pritchard, granddaughter of James and Myra Bradwell, and they were scheduled for publication in 1927, first in installments in the magazine “Liberty,” and then as a book.

Before the publication, however, Pritchard, as a courtesy, offered to show them to Mary Harlan Lincoln, widow of Robert Lincoln, who had just died the year before. Although she was initially agreeable to the project and even offered to add additional information, after reading the manuscript, Mary Harlan Lincoln withdrew her consent and launched a series of legal efforts to suppress their publication.

Pritchard eventually agreed to hand over the material and never publish them in any form, in exchange for a payment of $22,500.

Emerson’s book recompiles that material and presents it as it was intended to be published in 1927, including Pritchard’s comments on the letters. But it also includes Emerson’s own annotations and footnotes that provide context, as well as clarifications and corrections to some of Pritchard’s commentaries.

The letters reveal her to be lonely, occasionally depressed and at times desperate for companionship. But on their surface, do not necessarily portray someone of an unsound mind, especially considering the traumas she had endured through much of her life.

“Pray for me that I may be able to leave such a place as this,” she wrote to Myra Bradwell on Aug. 3, 1875. “Let me see Judge Bradwell. I beg you to come on Friday morning. I should like to see Dr. Evarts. I feel I must have some further conversation with him. Write me, your heartbroken friend, frequently, daily. But come to me. Will you kindly bring out some samples of black alpaca a best quality without luster and without cotton. Also some samples of heavier black woolen goods.”

The book is Emerson’s second work on the subject of the lost letters, which he uncovered in 2005. He found them locked away in a trunk that had once belonged to one of Robert Lincoln’s personal attorneys, Frederick Towers.

Capitol News Illinois · A new perspective on Mary Todd Lincoln


Using those letters and a wealth of other material, Emerson wrote his first book on the subject, “The Madness of Mary Lincoln,” in 2007.

In that book, Emerson cites a modern psychiatric expert who theorized that Mary Lincoln suffered from what would likely be diagnosed today as bipolar disorder.

“And he told me that today, Mary would be committed involuntarily for probably about seven days,” he said. “Doctors would look at her. They'd give her medication, and she'd be fine today, as long as she took the medication.”

“But back then, they didn't have that,” Emerson said. “But if you look at her whole life, it's very clear the incidence of bipolar disorder, or what used to be called manic depressive illness, where she's high and she's low, and she's wonderfully loving and horribly mean. Her spending could be considered a manic action. She was depressed a lot. So it's clear throughout her whole life.”

After her release, Mary Todd Lincoln lived a relatively quiet life, although she remained plagued by both psychiatric and physical ailments. She died in 1882 at the age of 63. She is buried next to her husband at the Lincoln Tomb in Springfield, along with three of their sons: Edward, William and Thomas.

Robert Lincoln went on to lead a distinguished career of his own. In addition to his legal career, he served as secretary of war under President James Garfield and continued in that post under President Chester A. Arthur after Garfield’s assassination. He also served as minister to Great Britain in the Benjamin Harrison administration. He died in 1926 at age 82.

The report, released Thursday following an independent seven-month investigation, also asserts that Connecticut State Police committed an “unexplained failure” by taking 15 months to seek arrest warrants for Anthony Mastrangelo, a town employee who allegedly sexually assaulted four girls, despite having probable cause to do so. During that 15-month period, a fifth victim was allegedly sexually assaulted. 
The report, prepared by former Superior Court Judge Robert L. Holzberg, now with the Pullman & Comley law firm, comes as Connecticut legislators are in the midst of debating a controversial bill that would require municipal camps to be licensed by the state. Currently, camps in Connecticut that are run by towns and cities receive no state oversight and aren’t required to comply with even basic regulations that private camps must abide by, like conducting staff background checks and testing water quality. 
“If this [report] isn’t a manifesto for the need to pass Senate Bill 6 this session, I don’t know what is,” Sen. Jorge Cabrera, D-Hamden, whose district includes Bethany, told The Connecticut Mirror. “We may never have a better reason, detailed for us in black and white. I want to use the word ‘shocking’ to describe what was uncovered in Bethany, but it goes beyond that. The callousness. The disregard. Utter incompetence. Basic, basic safety rules not adhered to. They can’t find reports and training manuals. And I love my cities and towns, but I wonder — what if we scratched a little deeper into more municipal programs? What would we find? Would we find excellence? Competence? Or more problems?”
Cofrancesco was among the voices of opposition when a similar bill was proposed in 2023. At the time, she argued that municipal camps already received enough oversight, including from elected leaders like herself.
But, according to the report, Bethany’s Parks and Recreation Department was in disarray at the time Cofrancesco provided written testimony against the bill, and she didn’t know if counselors there received background checks or safety training at all. According to the report, the department “had no filing or record-keeping system, written safety policies, or documented training protocols for its staff.” According to an interview in the report with Cofrancesco’s assistant, no background checks were conducted until 2024.
Cofrancesco did not respond to a request for comment. When asked for comment by reporters after the report came out on Thursday, she responded, “Not right now, thank you.”
State Police Col. Daniel Loughman said in a statement that he agreed with the report’s claim that Cofrancesco did not demand answers about the investigation before May 2024, and that Cofrancesco never sought a meeting with the state police after May 2024.
But the statement did not address the report’s concerns about the 15-month span between the beginning of the investigation and Mastrangelo’s arrest.
Gina Teixiera, a member of the Bethany Board of Selectmen, told the CT Mirror that  Cofrancesco should resign.
“I feel that it’s a fiduciary duty, given the liability she’s created for this town,” she said.
In a statement, Teixiera and Robert Brinton, the other member of the board of selectmen, said Cofrancesco’s behavior was “inexcusable.”
“The report reveals a First Selectwoman more concerned about her own self-interest and that of her family and friends, including the alleged child sex-abuser, than the safety of the children in our community,” the statement reads. “This is inexcusable. Her repeated deception of not only the members of the Board of Selectmen, but also all of the residents of the Town of Bethany, at meeting after meeting, is a betrayal from a person in a position of trust.”
Cofrancesco’s “leadership failures have harmed the Town of Bethany and exposed us to legal liability on multiple fronts,” it continues. “Town residents deserve answers about why municipal laptops and phones were deleted in violation of Connecticut Freedom of Information statutes. 
“Also, the residents of the Town of Bethany need answers about the unexplained, lengthy delay by the Connecticut State Police to make any arrest even after having sufficient probable cause in a case involving child sex abuse. This delay was supported by Paula Cofrancesco, who failed to communicate with the Connecticut State Police in any way, to request any information about the matter even after falsely saying she had tried to get answers from them many times,” the statement reads.
‘That claim is contradicted’
The report begins its timeline in December of 2022, when Bethany superintendent Kai Byrd learned that a parent would be filing a report with the Department of Children and Families (DCF) against Mastrangelo, a camp counselor, substitute teacher, after school program employee and frequent babysitter for local children. 
According to the report, Cofrancesco was informed by David Merriam, the administrative lieutenant for the Bethany Resident Trooper’s Office, of the nature of the allegations against Mastrangelo and that the Connecticut State Police were also investigating the matter. But after the allegations became public in 2024, Cofrancesco repeatedly insisted that she did not know the sexual nature of the allegations until much later. 
The report alleges that she was lying. 
“Corroborating e-mails and text messages [demonstrate] that the First Selectman, despite her denials, knew the specific nature of the allegations against Mastrangelo as early as December 23, 2022,” the report states.
“While the First Selectman still denies having actual knowledge … of the specific allegations against Mastrangelo, that claim is contradicted by multiple credible witnesses,” the report states.

The report indicates that, rather than alert the town about the allegations or fire Mastrangelo, Cofrancesco’s response was to keep quiet and ensure that Mastrangelo — a family friend — remained employed in the basement of Town Hall, adjacent to the Parks and Recreation complex, and later at her husband’s insurance firm. 
“Curiously, she acknowledged that she never attempted to speak to Mastrangelo about the allegations or reach out to DCF, the State Police, or Town Counsel about the allegations,” the report states.  
Cofrancesco also did not pursue any improvements of safety procedures in those programs after the allegations came to light and even denied requests from other staff members to install security cameras, according to the report. 
Even when Cofrancesco became aware that DCF had confirmed at least two allegations against Mastrangelo, she failed to “implement background checks of all Parks and Rec employees; direct an immediate and comprehensive review of Parks and Rec Programs and policies,” pursue safety measures for children, or even seek the advice of the town attorney, according to the report.

The report, which goes on for 28 pages and includes another 200 pages of appendices, was a massive undertaking for Holzberg, a retired judge of 32 years who has a reputation both as a skilled mediator and investigator. Holzberg also conducted independent investigations into sexual assault allegations at Stamford High School and the Bridgeport Archdiocese, where he identified 281 victims of sexual abuse by 71 priests dating back to 1953. 
For the Bethany report, Holzberg and his team of three lawyers spent seven months on the investigation and interviewed 48 witnesses and reviewed more than 125,000 emails and phone records. 
At one point, the former judge quoted a witness comparing Bethany to “Mayberry,” the fictional town in the 1960s-era Andy Griffith Show, where town employees are all related to each other. For example, the report said Cofrancesco is the cousin by marriage of the former Director of Parks and Recreation, Janice Howard; She is also the aunt by marriage of a Parks and Recreation Department employee, Anthony Cofrancesco, who was friends with Mastrangelo.
The report details concerns among other town staff about Mastrangelo’s continued employment and presence in town facilities. 
In the report, a transcript of a text message exchange between Howard and Cofrancesco shows that Howard didn’t want to be blamed for Mastrangelo’s continued work in a town facility after DCF and CSP launched their investigations. Howard writes, “you guys made the decision. Because that is how it happened and I want to make sure that is how it was relayed.”
The report also notes that Bethany Schools Superintendent Kai Byrd took immediate action after she learned that a report was to be filed with DCF, firing Mastrangelo as a substitute teacher and banning him from school property.

Holzberg notes that several parties were uncooperative with the Bethany investigation, including former leadership of the parks and recreation staff, whom the report accuses of deleting emails and text messages, and Connecticut State Police, which also denied Holzberg’s request to review its investigative file or provide an explanation for its delay in seeking warrants for Mastrangelo’s arrests. Cofrancesco also withheld text messages from Holzberg.
In a letter to Holzberg, Loughman cited the pending criminal case as to why police would not cooperate.
Holzberg concludes that, “the unexplained failure of the Connecticut State Police’s Bethany Troop I to seek arrest warrants for Mastrangelo in early 2023, despite having probable cause to initiate criminal proceedings arising from his assault of four victims, provided Mastrangelo an opportunity to commit a further assault in May 2024. The fifteen-month delay in seeking Mastrangelo’s arrests requires a full and candid explanation by the Commanding Officer of the CSP.”
Members of the community have called for Cofrancesco’s resignation since the report was released, including Amy Lestinsky, the mother of the fifth victim. Lestinsky helped Cofrancesco campaign for first selectman back in 2021.
“It’s super disheartening, because here I was supporting someone who I thought had the moral integrity and the know-how, and it’s all come out in black and white,” Lestinsky said. “She has none of them, and to me is not fit to run the town. I wanted her to resign last year and now, more than ever, I think she really should step down.”
Amy Rushlow, chair of the Bethany Democratic Town Committee, wrote in a post on Facebook that Cofrancesco’s “ineptitude, malfeasance, and gross neglect have no place in Bethany, especially as its leader. We call on Paula Cofrancesco to resign immediately. Our children and our town deserve better.”
Sen. Ceci Maher, co-chair of the state legislature’s Committee on Children, which has advocated for the camp licensing bill, said the report offers a clear example of why such oversight is under consideration by lawmakers.
“Not all camps operate like this. I’m hopeful that this is the exception. But something horrible happened in Bethany, and across 169 municipalities, with dozens upon dozens of different parks and recreation departments operating at different levels, it could happen again. It’s clear to me that we can do better. I look forward to seeing us do better.”

(United Methodist Health Ministry Fund/KU School of Nursing)TOPEKA — Maternity care is becoming out of reach for many in rural Kansas counties, where birth rates are higher than in urban areas, hospitals face closure and obstetrics services are few and far between.
The new report from the University of Kansas School of Nursing and Hutchinson-based United Methodist Health Ministry Fund examined Kansas’ maternity care deserts, or counties without nearby access to prenatal and obstetrics care.
The findings “paint a stark picture of the current landscape of access to maternal health,” said David Jordan, president and CEO of the health fund, which commissioned and funded the report. The report was based on statewide data from 2022-2024.
“The data also emphasize the critical importance of addressing this challenge before it gets worse, as well as recognizing that the location of services is one piece of the puzzle,” he said.
More than 40% of Kansas counties don’t have any maternal care services, and most Kansans live 30 miles or more from a high-risk delivery facility, the report found. Plus, most rural counties in the state do not have an obstetrician/gynecologist.
In western Kansas, Grant and Wallace counties, which sit on or near the Kansas-Colorado border, have the highest birth rates in the state. Wallace County, home to roughly 1,700 people, has no hospitals, birthing centers or facilities offering prenatal services. The closest facility offering inpatient maternity care is at least 50 miles away. In Grant County, maternity care isn’t available at existing facilities, the report found, and the closest maternity care facility is at least 24 miles away. 
Labor and delivery services and high-risk care are most difficult to access, the report found. About 30% of Kansas ZIP codes are 100 miles or more from high-risk pregnancy services.
Medicaid, the joint federal and state public health insurance program, pays for about 40% of all births in Kansas. After delivery, mothers are eligible for continued coverage for a year if they make an annual income less than or equal to 171% of the federal poverty level, which amounts to $47,453 or less for a family of four. 
The report also revealed the unrecognized costs associated with providing maternity care, which requires the constant presence and attention of teams of nurses and clinicians. Reimbursement rates through public insurance programs can be lacking. 
Addressing maternal care deserts requires sound data, said Karen Weis, the lead author of the report and dean of KU School of Nursing-Salina.
“Kansas legislators, health care systems, foundations, professional organizations and educational institutions are all working hard to address the concerns of access to care and the health care workforce,” she said.
The report highlight four priorities to improve the state’s maternal health care. Providers could use telehealth more frequently as a way to expand maternal health options. Rural areas could create regional models of care so providers can more easily collaborate.
The Legislature could increase reimbursement rates for maternity care services to ease affordability concerns and retain care providers.
“Eighty-six percent of Kansas hospitals experienced a loss of services in 2023, 63% are at risk of closing and 32% are at risk of immediate closure,” the report said.
The report encouraged further engagement and research to maximize scarce resources.
Jordan said Kansas needs new, innovative solutions “to complete the puzzle in order to provide women, children and families across the state with better access to the services they need to thrive.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/25_SON_Access-to-Care_SM_Facilities_Inpatient-OB-e1747421344479-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-05-16 17:07:53.463306

As the state Legislature is in the process of crafting the next state budget, economists from the University of Michigan and other experts presented research and estimations Friday on the trajectory of the national and state economies, looking at the potential impacts of federal tariffs, unemployment rates and tax revenue in order to inform lawmakers’ decisions in the budget-making process.

With much of the Trump administration’s actions varying day-to-day, Ehrlich said job loss estimates due to tariffs are “very uncertain”, but as things stand now, Michigan could lose 13,000 jobs as a result of tariffs on the automotive industry as manufacturing costs increase and many of the vehicles Michigan produces see a $6,200 average increase in prices.
“Uncertainty” is the word of the day State Treasurer Rachael Eubanks said in reviewing the presentations that were given
“We are not an island. There are real and serious implications to federal trade and tax policy actions that are impacting each state uniquely,” Eubanks said. “So, we are monitoring the latest federal development continuously, which sometimes seems to change on the hour, and it can be challenging to keep up with the latest developments when you’re in the business of forecasting the revenues in the economy.”
Additionally, the result of the meeting of budget leaders of the Legislature and state called the Consensus Revenue Estimating Conference, or CREC, was that lawmakers will have less funds to work with than previously estimated in the January CREC meeting.
The consensus was with state revenues on the decline, lawmakers will have about $320 million less to appropriate in the 2025-26 fiscal budget.

Tensions around formulating a state budget are already high in the partisanly split state Legislature as communication between leaders of the Republican-majority House and the Democratic-majority Senate remains minimal while Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids) sues House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Twp.) over Hall’s refusal to send bills leftover from the previous session to the governor’s desk for approval.
Since the current legislative session began in January, following two years of bicameral Democratic control of the Legislature, lawmakers have only gotten two bills signed into law to retain tipped wages in Michigan and implement new sick time requirements.
Earlier this week Michigan Senate Democrats passed their nearly $84.6 billion proposal for the state’s Fiscal Year 2026 budget, surpassing Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s proposed $83.5 billion proposed budget.
The Senate plan, which is part of the negotiation between the House and governor in order to create a state budget, invests in schools, public safety and infrastructure, a news release from Senate Democrats Wednesday asserts.
“Our budget puts Michigan families first — plain and simple,” Sen. Sarah Anthony (D-Lansing), Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee said in the news release. “It’s a reflection of what we’ve heard from residents across the state: they want good schools, safe communities, access to health care, and real opportunities to build a better life.” 
The House is still working out the details of its plans, but following CREC on Friday, Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) said in a news release budget negotiations are shaping up to be a battle for which Democrats are going to blame the Trump administration for their own thoughtless actions.
“The Senate’s own fiscal analysts are saying the budget the Democrats passed just two days ago puts Michigan into a billion-dollar deficit. And they were so proud of rushing it through without thinking,” Hall said in the release. “I’ve been telling you from the beginning that we’re negotiating with unserious people. House Republicans are going to have to be the adults in the room once again.”

The cities ranked in the top 100 U.S. cities for population growth from 2020 to 2024, the Idaho Department of Labor announced in a news release. Here’s how they ranked:

51st place: Caldwell, with 21.5% population growth. It grew by 12,918 people to 73,088 population.
54th place: Kuna, with 21% population growth. It grew by 5,047 people to 29,127 population.
70th place: Post Falls, with 18.6% population growth. It grew by 7,195 people to 45,800 population.
71st place: Meridian, with 18.6% population growth. It grew by 21,946 people to 139,740 population.
91st place: Nampa, with 16.8% population growth. It grew by 16,922 people to 117,350 population.

Between 2023 and 2024, Idaho cities as a whole grew faster than the state. Cities combined growth rate was 1.8%, compared to Idaho’s overall growth rate of 1.5%. 
But in that year, 57 Idaho cities — mostly smaller ones with less than 1,000 residents — saw populations decline somewhat. The city of Lewiston, Idaho’s 11th most populated city, had the biggest dip: Declining by 144 people, to a current population of around 34,700 people.",https://idahocapitalsun.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/IMG_3656-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-16 17:07:53.463306

(Mark Wilson | Getty Images)Unions representing workers laid off at federal health and oversight agencies are heading to Washington D.C. next week to protest past and continued cuts to their workforces by the federal government’s new Department of Government Efficiency.
In a news release Friday, the American Federation of Government Employees — which represents workers at the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — said it will join other labor unions, including the AFL-CIO, in a protest outside the federal Department of Health and Human Services headquarters at noon on Thursday, May 22.
The unions are demanding four things, per the release:

Full reinstatement of all laid-off employees
Restoration of funding to all affected programs
An end to “retaliatory and offsetting” layoffs
Direct engagement with union leadership before any future restructuring at the federal level

The labor moves comes as several layoffs and reductions in force at the federal level under DHHS have already been rolled back. Earlier this week, a federal judge ordered DHHS to reinstate all workers at NIOSH’s Division of Respiratory Health, including employees from the Coal Workers’ Health Surveillance Program.
In Pennsylvania, NIOSH workers responsible for certifying respirators were also returned to work.
But still, hundreds of other NIOSH employees and workers from the CDC are still without jobs. Meanwhile, the work they did — some of which are the product of orders from Congress — is going unperformed.
Workers at NIOSH were first put on administrative leave in April through an agency-wide reduction in force. In early May, some were reinstated. Then they were put on leave again after only a few days. Now — through the federal court order issued in West Virginia last week — at least some workers are returning to the agency permanently.
More cuts in other departments, however, are scheduled to take effect between June and July.
The reductions in force from the federal government have been characterized as tools to reduce wasteful spending and promote efficiency within the organizations. The cuts, however, have led to numerous lawsuits, freezes in critical work, confusion and widespread concern from individuals who rely on that work to do their jobs safely.
“These layoffs are not targeting inefficiency, they are targeting science,” said Yolanda Jacobs, president of AFGE Local 2883 in Atlanta, where the CDC is based. “Public health researchers and frontline scientists are being thrown out of their jobs while the country faces growing environmental, occupational and public health crises.”
Per the release from the AFGE, work that’s stopped includes research on toxicology, exposure to certain substances, mine safety, chemical hazards, the impact of workplace oversights and more.
Several of these services that are now going undone are congressionally mandated through the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. Several labor unions filed suit on May 14 against the federal government, arguing that since the cuts are stopping work that is required by Congress, they are illegal.
That was the same successful argument used in West Virginia, where coal miners filed suit against the government due to cuts at NIOSH robbing them of congressionally-mandated protections against black lung disease. The judge in that case issued a temporary injunction ordering the full restoration of staff at NIOSH’s Division of Respiratory Health.

Free.,Abrego Garcia judge questions administration’s broad use of state secrets privilege,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/abrego-garcia-judge-questions-administrations-broad-use-state-secrets-privilege,,"GREENBELT, MARYLAND — A federal judge said Friday the Trump administration has “pretty broadly” invoked the state secrets privilege to withhold information on its efforts — or, the judge indicated, a possible lack of effort — to return a wrongly deported Maryland man from a prison in El Salvador.President Donald Trump’s administration moved last month to invoke the so-called state secrets privilege to shield information about its process to facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the United States after a top immigration official admitted his removal to a prison in El Salvador was an “administrative error.”The judge handling the case, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis, granted an expedited discovery process after she found last month that “nothing has been done” by the administration to return Abrego Garcia.She did not make a public order regarding the state secrets privilege Friday afternoon before closing her courtroom to the public to discuss sensitive matters with attorneys for Abrego Garcia and the Department of Justice.The state secrets privilege is a common-law doctrine that protects sensitive national security information from being released. The Trump administration has argued the need to invoke it in this case to protect diplomatic relationships.‘He’ll never walk free in the United States’During the public portion of Friday’s hearing, Xinis pressed the Department of Justice attorneys about Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s comment that Abrego Garica “will not return” to the U.S.“That sounds to me like an admission that your client will not take steps to facilitate the return,” Xinis said. “That’s about as clear as it can get.”DOJ attorney Jonathan D. Guynn disagreed and said the Trump administration is complying with court orders. He said Noem’s comment meant that if Abrego Garcia was back in U.S. custody he would be removed either to another third country or back to El Salvador.“He’ll never walk free in the United States,"" Guynn said.He added that the Trump administration is “currently complying and we plan to comply.”Xinis said she disagreed, and then she clashed with Guynn over the legality of Abrego Garcia’s removal.Guynn said that he was lawfully deported.Xinis answered that she found months ago that Abrego Garcia was unlawfully detained and removed from the U.S.Few documents producedOne of the attorneys for Abrego Garcia, Andrew J. Rossman, said the Trump administration has invoked the state secrets privilege for 1,140 documents relating to the case. From that request, Rossman said his team received 168 documents, but 132 were copies of court filings and requests made by him and his team.Xinis seemed visibly stunned by Rossman’s report and had to clarify that his team had only received 36 new documents, which Rossman confirmed.Rossman said that none of the documents for which the government is invoking the state secrets privilege are classified.“There’s ways to do this right, and they haven't done it,” he said, noting that he has attorneys on his team who have security clearances and can review classified and sensitive information.Rossman said that he and his team are seeking answers to three questions: the status of Abrego Garcia, what steps the Trump administration has taken, if any, to facilitate his return, and the steps the federal government will take, if any, to comply with court orders.Guynn said the Trump administration received an update from El Salvador on Thursday that Abrego Garcia was in “good health” and had “even gained weight.""The U.S. Supreme Court ordered that the Trump administration must ""facilitate"" the return of Abrego Garcia.Rossman, said that it’s “deeply disturbing” that administration officials, including the president, have made public statements that contradict court orders directing the government to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S.President Donald Trump has said he could easily pick up the phone and order El Salvador to return him but won’t because he believes Abrego Garica is a member of the MS-13 gang.Noem was pressed at a May 14 congressional hearing about a photo that appears altered to add letters across Abrego Garcia’s knuckles to indicate his inclusion in the gang. She said she was unaware of it.A federal judge in the District of Columbia, in a separate case regarding Trump’s use of an archaic wartime law for deportations, questioned Department of Justice attorneys on the president’s claim that he could order Abrego Garcia to be returned. The attorney admitted that the president sometimes overstates his influence abroad.El Salvador prisonAbrego Garcia has had protections from deportation since 2019, but he was one of nearly 300 men on three mid-March removal flights to a notorious prison in El Salvador known as CECOT.Abrego Garcia has been moved to a lower security prison, according to Maryland Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen, who traveled to the country last month to meet with Abrego Garcia and inquire with Salvadoran officials about why he is being held there.Those officials said Abrego Garcia was being held because of the agreement between the United States and El Salvador.The U.S. has a $15 million agreement with El Salvador's government to house immigrants removed from the U.S., mostly Venezuelans removed under the wartime law, the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.

The Trump administration has argued that Abrego Garcia is a national of El Salvador and in that country’s custody and the U.S. cannot force another government to return him. Hours before Friday’s hearing, dozens of protestors gathered outside the court, calling for Abrego Garcia to be returned to the U.S., as well as criticizing the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. U.S. Rep. Glenn Ivey, who represents the area in Maryland where Abrego Garcia and his family live, appeared outside the court and led chants calling for the release of Abrego Garcia from El Salvador.“The president has to obey the orders of the Supreme Court,” Ivey said. “The Supreme Court has spoken here, and it's time for him to follow it and bring him home.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-05-16 17:07:53.463306

For a second year in a row, New York City and Los Angeles were among the cities with the most population growth last year as the nation’s largest cities continued to recover from devastating pandemic losses.
The U.S. Census Bureau released new July 2024 city population estimates Thursday.
In New York City, a recent city planning report suggested that “two consecutive years of growth suggest that pandemic-era losses were short-lived.” The city is still almost 328,000 short of its 2020 population, however.

Are you a teacher, nurse or skilled trades worker looking to buy a house or condo in today’s market? We’d like to talk to you about the experience of trying to buy a home with a household income of around $75,000 a year — email Tim Henderson at thenderson@stateline.org.




The largest one-year population increases for mid-2023 to mid-2024 were New York City (87,184), Houston (43,217), Los Angeles (31,276), and the Texas cities of San Antonio (23,945) and Fort Worth (23,442). The same cities were in the top five the previous year, but the growth is a big turnaround from 2021-22, when New York City lost almost 100,000 people and Los Angeles gained only about 2,000.
A new interest in living in big cities could be impacting rents: Zillow reported this week that there now are eight cities, double the number from 2020, where renters need more than a $100,000 annual income to afford typical rent: New York City ($145,000 needed), San Jose, California ($137,000), Boston ($127,000), San Francisco ($124,000), San Diego ($123,000), Los Angeles ($119,000), Miami ($110,000) and Riverside, California ($103,000).
Homes for sale in the fastest-growing city areas also are getting further out of reach for even moderate-income buyers, according to a National Association of Realtors report also released Thursday. The New York City and Los Angeles areas were listed as “moving in the wrong direction” on affordability, “reflecting a growing divide between what homes actually cost and what local families can afford.”
For instance, even a Los Angeles-area family with a $200,000 income can afford less than a third of the homes listed for sale, including condominiums and townhouses, according to the report.
Houston, San Antonio and the Dallas-Fort Worth area were listed among three tiers as “stuck in the middle” of affordability, “showing signs of progress, yet still falling short of offering real affordability to most families.”
For the four years combined after the COVID-19 pandemic started in 2020, both New York City and Los Angeles have not completely recovered population. New York City is down almost 328,000 people and Los Angeles is still short about 21,000 since the 2020 census, but they remain the nation’s two largest cities.
The largest percentage growth since 2020 was in some fast-growing suburbs: Westlake, Florida, near Palm Beach, has grown to 7,664, more than eight times its 2020 population, and Josephine, Texas, near Dallas, has quadrupled in size to 8,807. Medicine Lake, Minnesota, west of Minneapolis, also quadrupled, to 1,343.

The bill would initiate major changes to Vermont’s education finance and governance systems, setting in motion several years of transformation.

Phil Scott, speaks with Sen Seth Bongartz, D-Windham, right, chair of the Senate Education Committee, in a hallway at the Statehouse in Montpelier on Friday, May 16. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerA key Senate committee advanced the Legislature’s landmark education bill Thursday, but not before nearly every committee member vented their discomfort with the legislation. “I can’t remember ever feeling as bad about a vote as I do on this one, but it will move us forward,” Sen. Ann Cummings, D-Washington, the Senate Finance Committee’s chair, told her colleagues after voting out H.454. The bill proposes generational changes to Vermont’s school governance and finance systems that would phase in over multiple years, including school district consolidation and a new education funding formula, but leaves open some key decision points for the future. Both chambers of the Legislature and Republican Gov. Phil Scott have made education reform the year’s key issue in response to last year’s double-digit average property tax increases, and all three drafted different versions of wide-ranging reforms. The Senate Finance Committee ultimately voted 5-2 to move H.454 forward. The entire Senate is expected to vote on the bill next week, and senators have signalled there may be amendments put forward on the floor. If the legislation passes, House and Senate members are expected to further negotiate over differences in a conference committee. The compromise version would then require majority approval in both chambers before being sent to the governor.Though the Senate’s current version departs from both the House’s and Scott’s packages, both chambers and the administration have broadly agreed the state should transition to a new education funding formula and move toward consolidating school districts. Disagreement has developed over the details and the timeline. The Senate’s version of H.454 seeks to transition the state to a foundation formula by July 2027, potentially two years faster than the House-passed bill. A foundation formula is the most common type of education funding system across the country. The approach provides districts money based on the number of students in each district and how expensive those students are to teach. Disagreement between the chambers has also developed over who should map out the potential new, larger school districts. The House proposed having Vermont public education experts suggest districts with the help of legislators; the Senate wants lawmakers to draw the lines. Both chambers agreed to have the work done over the summer for consideration in the next legislative session. The Senate nixed class size minimums, a concept in both the House’s legislation and Scott’s proposals, and adopted a different foundation formula. Compared to the House’s version, the Senate’s language also allows more currently operating independent schools to continue receiving public funding in a future, consolidated education landscape. Organizations representing Vermont’s superintendents, principals and school board members, have come out in support of the House’s draft. As a Thursday afternoon deadline to vote out the bill loomed, finance committee members voiced their frustration with aspects of the bill ranging from its pace to the details of foundation formula it proposes. “I’m extremely uncomfortable with all of this,” Sen. Martine Gulick, D-Chittenden Central, said, eventually joining Sen. Ruth Hardy, D-Addison, in voting “no.”Sen. Thomas Chittenden, D-Chittenden Southeast, voted to advance the bill in committee to continue its progress but said he may oppose it on the floor due in part to his concern that the timeline is too fast. Sen. Randy Brock, R-Franklin, told his colleagues that virtually everyone had something to be mad about in the bill, but inaction was a worse option. “The question is how uncomfortable you are at the prospect of these changes versus doing nothing at all,” he said. The committee’s three Republicans joined Chittenden and Cummings in approving H.454. Read the story on VTDigger here:  Despite discomfort, Senate committee advances landmark education bill, setting up clash with House.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/malucci-bongartz-1-20250516-1024x676.jpg,,,2025-05-16 16:07:49.411823

(Photo by Michael Clevenger, Courier Journal, via press pool)A judge has rejected efforts by former Gov. Matt Bevin and his ex-wife Glenna Bevin to keep their divorce settlement confidential, ruling in favor of their adopted son Jonah Bevin, 18, who had asked it be public.
The judge noted the high-profile divorce and Jonah’s allegations of abuse and neglect by his parents already have attracted widespread media coverage and that Matt Bevin, though no longer governor, is a public figure.
“He once held the highest office in this state,” Jefferson Family Court Judge Angela Johnson’s order said of the one-term Republican. “Whether he knew it at the time he chose to run for office, in doing so he chose to become a public figure for life.”
“Concealing the allocation of assets,” her order said, “could generate speculation about political grift or other unethical conduct.”
The Courier Journal also had argued the settlement should be public, citing his role as a public figure and his advocacy of adoption.
Matt Bevin, a business entrepreneur whose wealth was estimated in the millions when he ran for governor in 2015, and his wife have owned several houses, each valued at more than $1 million. Bevin ran on a campaign of improving foster care and adoption in Kentucky, often holding up his family as an example.
The Bevins have five biological children, all adults, and four adopted children, all but one over 18. Jonah was adopted by the Bevins at age 5 from Ethiopia along with the three other children.

The judge’s order noted the Bevins claimed to have provided for all their children in the divorce settlement.
Johnson, in a 22-page order released Friday, also granted Jonah’s request to intervene in the divorce case — which he had sought to protect his interests and which the Bevins had opposed.
While it might be unusual for a child to intervene in his parents’ divorce, so is this case, the judge said.
“This court would be remiss if it did not recognize this case is profoundly unique, unlike any other divorce case proceeding heard in this Commonwealth,” the order said. 
As part of the case, Jonah has obtained protective orders against his parents, alleging they abandoned him at age 17 in a brutally abusive facility in Jamaica closed last year by child welfare authorities.
Also, the judge rejected Glenna Bevin’s request to soften the terms of a restraining order against her. 
Jonhson, in her order, said terms of the protective orders were worked out in a settlement and she will not allow Glenna Bevin “to walk away from the agreement she made.”
In all, the order ruled in Jonah’s favor on all measures he had sought in the pending family court case. He has said in court  he is living on his own and spent his 18th birthday in a homeless shelter in Utah after returning to the United States from Jamaica with no assistance from his parents.
The Bevins did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Dawn J. Post, a lawyer and child advocate helping represent Jonah, hailed the judge’s order as “one important step forward” in his effort to find justice and stability. She said it also helps Jonah  in his effort to give voice to other children from failed adoptions who find themselves abandoned, often in abusive facilities.
“This decision not only gives Jonah the opportunity to be heard but to stand fully in his truth after years of abandonment,” Post said.
Jonah also is represented by Louisville lawyers John H. Helmers and Melina Hettiarachi.
A key portion of the judge’s order dealt with Jonah’s education and whether he has a valid high school degree, as Matt Bevin has claimed. That determination could affect the Bevins’ further obligations to him, it said.
Jonah’s lawyers have alleged he was in and out of various out-of-state residential facilities  since age 13 and received no meaningful education, calling a diploma he received last year through an online Christian school based in Florida a “sham.”
The judge’s order notes that one of the obligations of parents under state law is to provide a child with adequate care, supervision, food, clothing, shelter and education.

Matt Bevin argued that the Florida-based Veritas Mission Academy is an accredited school in Florida. 
But the judge’s order found no reliable verification of that claim.
“As far as the court is aware, there is no reputable entity vouching for the educational standards at Veritas Mission Academy,” it said.
Jonah told the Lantern in an interview earlier this year he struggles with learning disabilities that affect his ability to read and write.
The judge said Jonah’s appearance in court led her to question his level of education, noting in court proceedings “Jonah appeared to struggle with the vocabulary and communications skills necessary to articulate his thoughts, feelings and experiences.”
“This leads the court to believe his high school education has not adequately prepared him to live his life as an independent adult,” Johnson’s order said.
The judge also addressed another question in the case — whether Jonah turned 18 last November. In a recent court hearing, Jonah’s lawyers said adoption records they recently obtained showed a discrepancy, with one indicating he might be 17.
The judge concluded he is 18, noting the discrepancy occurred in only one of several records the Bevins produced and was likely an error. Still, that doesn’t lessen his potential claims, including support, the order said, adding.
“If the court decides Jonah is entitled to some form of child support, it has the authority to craft an appropriate solution.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Bevin207-1024x727.jpg,,,2025-05-16 16:07:49.411823

Nancy Mace thanked a judge Friday for denying bond to a Greenville transgender woman accused of threatening her life, saying she and her children live in constant fear.
“My kids lives in fear of being killed. … They live in fear of their mom being shot,” Mace told reporters after the bond hearing in Greenville. “I live with that fear every day as well.”

Magistrate James Hudson denied bond to Roxie Wolfe, who is charged and booked as Samuel Theodore Cain, after Mace read a statement to the judge about feeling terrorized by transgender activists. The mother of two teenagers asked him to provide them “peace of mind” and show that South Carolina “will protect women.”
“I believe the trans movement is radicalized. It’s a cult,” Mace told Hudson, reading from her phone.
The congresswoman, who is mulling a run for governor next year, has fostered a reputation as a staunch opponent to the transgender rights movement — what she called “the so-called trans movement” — and has repeatedly used language considered slurs.
She went on to tell the judge she believes transgender people are “mentally ill” and violent.
“As a public official we accept public scrutiny. We do not accept terror,” Mace said.
Hudson then denied bond, telling Wolfe, “I do believe you are a credible threat.”

The accused 19-year-old Greenville resident asked to speak during the brief hearing, but the judge advised against it.
“We’re not here to discuss the situation or for you to defend yourself,” Hudson said.
Wolfe did not have an attorney. Hudson told her to fill out paperwork and let the court know if she needs a public defender.
There will be a second bond hearing before a Circuit Court judge, though when is not yet known. Once a bond is set, another condition will be a ban on contacting Mace in any way, Hudson said.
Wolfe was arrested Thursday for an April 26 post on X threatening to “assassinate” Mace with a gun, according to an arrest warrant from the State Law Enforcement Division.

Four days after the post, the 19-year-old admitted to federal authorities to authoring and posting the threat, the warrant said.
While the arrest warrant says Wolfe is a white male, she has identified on social media as a transgender woman, using she/her pronouns.
The maximum penalty in South Carolina for threatening the life of a public official is a $5,000 fine and five years in prison.
Wolfe is the first person charged in South Carolina with threatening Mace, but the congresswoman has publicly talked about other death threats. Last month, she said she was among the named targets of a Pennsylvania man who posted online as “Mr. Satan” as he threatened to kill President Donald Trump and “anyone who stands in the way.”
She has also cited safety concerns in explaining why she hasn’t held an in-person town hall this year.
Mace, who represents the coastal 1st District, said she didn’t know when she learned about the April 26 post on X where the possible gunman lived and had to make immediate changes to her plans.
As she stood in the hearing Friday, she told reporters afterward, “all I could think about was his family” and her children. As a mom, she said, “it was heartbreaking” to watch.
“This is a serious charge. There should be serious consequences,” Mace told reporters after the hearing. “It’s a serious matter. It’s also illegal. It’s a crime. Nobody, whether they’re elected or not, should live in fear anywhere in the country.”

(Courtesy of Howard K. Marcus)LINCOLN — Omaha will have a new mayor next month. 
Douglas County Treasurer John Ewing Jr. became the first Democrat to lead the largest city in Nebraska in roughly a decade. He is also the first elected Black mayor in the city’s history.  
Ewing won by a double-digit margin, performing better in some traditionally Republican-leaning central and western parts of the city than former State Sen. Tony Vargas did in his failed 2024 bid to unseat U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., in the Omaha area. 
Before this week’s mayoral election, Omaha was the nation’s sixth most populated city with a Republican mayor, where Mayor Jean Stothert served three terms and sought a fourth. Ewing’s win comes after Lancaster County Democrats maintained a 6-1 majority on the Lincoln City Council earlier this month. Lincoln Democrats also have Mayor Leirion Gaylor Baird.

Omaha and Lincoln are now led by Democrats in red-led Nebraska for the first time since 2009, when Omaha Mayor Jim Suttle and Lincoln Mayor Chris Beutler overlapped. 
The political dynamics of the state are bound to change with Democrats now holding leadership positions in the municipal governments of the state’s two largest cities. At the same time, the Nebraska Legislature continues to drift toward a more conservative brand of Republican — a phenomenon most associated with Southern states but also in neighboring Missouri. 
In those states, blue-led cities face a steeper climb for funding and policy changes as Republican-dominated legislatures work to undermine some of the goals pursued by Democratic mayors and City Councils. State and federal funding often get caught in the political crossfire.
One local example: Lincoln’s mayor, Gaylor Baird, and Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen disagreed on where a state prison should be located in 2023. Initially, Baird said she didn’t want a prison in Lincoln, but the state threatened to put it in a residential Lincoln neighborhood until she relented on the state’s original proposed site. 
Partisan reads on situation
Partisans on both sides of the aisle saw different things in the results. The Douglas County Republican Party chair and the governor blamed low GOP turnout. The state GOP chair took a more somber view, saying she sees a changing political landscape.  
National and state Democrats were quick to use Ewing’s victory as evidence of growing voter “energy” against President Donald Trump and political fuel for the 2026 congressional midterms, as Democrats try to flip the Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District House seat held by U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb. 
The race also fell into some patterns from national politics in the final weeks before Election Day, as Stothert’s backers pushed an anti-transgender ad blitz, a political decision that helped Republicans in November. It was seen as a last-ditch effort to mobilize her base. It failed. 
Progressive news outlets and State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha called Ewing’s victory a referendum “against trans hate and discrimination.” 
“Regular Americans don’t react to or receive the call to trans panic,” Hunt said on social media, “Enough. We are speaking to the future.”
Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin called Ewing’s victory a “notice” for Bacon and other “vulnerable House Republicans.” Bacon’s 2nd District, which includes Douglas, western Sarpy and Saunders Counties, is typically a target of both national parties, one of the rare remaining districts that is politically split, though it still has a slight GOP lean. Democrats have won the seat before, the last time when former State Sen. Brad Ashford won in 2014. But Bacon beat him and has survived challengers since. 
He has not yet said whether he will run again in 2026, but many believe Bacon is set to retire this summer or fall, which would set off a mad scramble in both parties for an open-seat race. Democrats are lining up. Already, Omaha nonprofit executive Denise Powell has announced a bid. State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha is flirting with one. Republicans are waiting in the wings for Bacon to decide, including former State Sen. Brett Lindstrom and some Republicans with ties to City Hall.
“Voters are sick of cowardly Republicans willing to bend the knee to Trump at their expense,” Martin said. “They want true leaders who will govern on behalf of working families and not billionaire donors, which is why Democrats like John Ewing Jr. are winning elections up and down the ballot.” 
Nebraska’s 2nd District still red
Ewing’s victory joins a list of Democrats overperforming with Trump in office for a second term. But the 2nd District includes people in more Republican-leaning areas than just the Democratic-leaning city of Omaha, and they don’t vote in Omaha city elections. 
The fundamentals of the district haven’t changed, political observers say, despite national media and Democratic talk of the city election being a possible hint at bluer-leaning federal and state elections. The GOP-led majority in the officially nonpartisan Legislature drew the 2nd District boundaries after the most recent Census, partly to protect Republicans’ ability to hold the seat.  Data shows that the district’s borders give Republicans a slight advantage by replacing some Democratic-voting residents in Sarpy County with the more reliably Republican-voting residents of Saunders County.
Randy Adkins, a University of Nebraska at Omaha political science professor, said Ewing’s “upset” win — though less surprising locally than nationally — was due to numerous issues expected in a local city race, including street repairs, but it lacked a “key” issue. 
In the city of Omaha, there are more registered Democrats than Republican voters, with  114,400 registered Democrats and 95,485 registered Republicans. At last count, the other 83,187 registered voters were mostly nonpartisan, with a smaller group of Libertarians, or in the Legal Marijuana NOW Party. 
Republicans hold a registration advantage in the wider 2nd District, with 160,185 registered Republicans. Democrats are second, with 143,676 registered voters. The remaining 115,969 registered voters in the congressional district are mostly independent, or nonpartisan, and a smaller portion in either the Libertarian Party or the Legal Marijuana NOW Party, according to data from the Secretary of State’s office. 
“There are probably some people who felt it was time for a change, some who were upset about the streetcar,” Adkins said. “There were just multiple pieces along the way that led to Ewing’s victory.”
Ewing’s performance
Adkins also said Ewing had name recognition, having been elected multiple times for Douglas County Treasurer, which is a countywide position, unlike former State Sen. Mike McDonnell, a converted Republican labor leader whose Legislative District 5 only covered part of the city. McDonnell, who focused much of his criticism on Stothert, failed to advance in the mayor’s April primary despite outspending Ewing. The mayor’s race is officially nonpartisan. 
According to a Center for Politics analysis, Ewing also made significant gains in the northeastern part of the city compared to Vargas’s failed bid to unseat Bacon last year. East Omaha is home to the city’s most Democrats, and Northeast Omaha is home to the city’s handful of Black-majority precincts. 
Bacon, in contrast, ran more than eight percentage points better than Trump in Omaha in 2024, losing to Vargas by 10.4% within the city limits instead of 18.8%. Bacon also outperformed Stothert’s latest bid by at least two percentage points. 
Some might be taking the local race results too far, Adkins said, but it is “probably an early bellwether” for a more competitive race in the 2nd District, which often finishes inside of two or three percentage points. Adkins said Bacon was clearly “paying a lot of close attention” to the Omaha mayoral race.
Bacon posted praise on social media for Stothert’s mayoral tenure and congratulated Ewing. 
“She’s helped make Omaha the best place to live in America with the fastest growing economy … I’m confident her legacy will benefit the city of Omaha for decades to come,” Bacon’s post on X reads. “I congratulate John Ewing on his victory. We will work together to serve the great citizens of Omaha.” 
Omaha is changing
Leaders of local Democratic Party chapters in Lancaster and Douglas Counties said the race shows that Omaha is changing. 
Douglas County Democratic Party Chair CJ King said the race indicates that Omaha is changing and a “rejection of the MAGA principles.” In Lancaster County, home to Lincoln, county Democratic Party Chair Hannah Wroblewski said wins signal that Nebraskans are seeking practical leadership.
Nebraska Democratic Party Executive Director Precious McKesson celebrated the win as “monumental.” She said it would bring “needed diversity into the top leadership position of our city.”
Nebraska Republican Party Chair Mary Jane Truemper released a statement on the party’s losses in local races in the state’s two most populous counties, calling them a reminder that Nebraska’s “political landscapes are shifting.” 
“Voters are thinking more independently and expecting more substance from those seeking their support,” Truemper said, “We’re rethinking how we show up in every corner of the state and making it clear that Nebraskans deserve leadership rooted in real-world results, not political theater.” 
Turnout mattered
Douglas County Republican Party Chair Nancy Hicks said too few Republicans turned out to support Stothert. 
“The voters will soon be aware of the challenges that will hit Omaha with a Democratic Mayor,” Hicks said. “Republican Mayors have helped our city become such a great place to live.”
Pillen also blamed low turnout for Stothert’s loss, saying her victory should have been a “slam dunk” during a Republican watch party on Tuesday in northwest Omaha.

Turnout for Omaha’s general election was the lowest for a city general election since 2013, with around 32.1% of registered voters casting a ballot. 
For years, the conventional political wisdom has been that Republicans benefit from low turnout and off-year elections, while Democrats need to drive up turnout to win, often relying on the draw of statewide or presidential elections. Over the past three decades, Democrats have pushed to mobilize young voters, seniors and early voters to ensure high turnout. But a wave of GOP and progressive populism has taken over national politics, and, at least when Trump is on the ballot, Republicans have been benefiting more from high-turnout elections. 
Lincoln has been a “blue city” since 1999. Lancaster County’s Democratic Party chair, Wroblewski, said being a blue city with a Legislature becoming more conservative has its challenges, but it sharpens the local party’s focus. 
“We work to build strong local coalitions, find shared priorities when possible, and make it clear that constituents expect good governance,” Wroblesiki said, “Not partisanship.” 
 What’s next for Omaha?
Ewing has already leaned into the national framing of his victory with a recent MSNBC interview, saying he’s “not afraid of Trump.” 
Nebraska Republicans have gained more control of state legislation, making filibusters less effective than in the past. Democratic leaders in local governments have not yet faced a more hostile relationship, like in Texas, where the state is going after cities that have decriminalized small amounts of marijuana within city limits.   
A Republican in that supermajority, rural state Sen Loren Lippincott of Central City, said Omaha shows that the Nebraska electorate is always looking for new ideas and proves that area of the state is a “color blind” to red and blue tradition, like many political battlegrounds. He said Omaha voters look beyond labels and seek policies that serve their interests and the state. 
“Incumbents [should] watch out,” Lippincott said. 
Bacon has recently said that there are few givens in life. 
“Taxes, deaths, a competitive [Nebraska  2nd congressional district] race,” Bacon wrote on X.

(Photo by Shelby Wyatt / Source NM)Executive orders from the governor’s office show New Mexico has so far authorized over $2 million to be spent on the emergency deployment of National Guard troops to the state’s largest city, even before most people might notice their presence on the streets.
As many as 70 soldiers are expected to deploy to the city imminently, according to an April news release from the governor’s office. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham previously told Source NM troops have already started training for their new roles with the New Mexico departments of Homeland Security, Public Safety, State Police and the Albuquerque Police Department.
Albuquerque Police Chief Harold Medina on March 31 asked Lujan Grisham to send in “immediate reinforcement” to help his officers deal with fentanyl use and violent crimes allegedly committed by children.
Lujan Grisham on April 7 declared an emergency in the city of Albuquerque and authorized the New Mexico National Guard to spend $750,000 in order to help the Albuquerque Police Department.
The executive order states that National Guard troops would help APD with “non-law enforcement” activities including traffic control, administrative duties, transporting incarcerated people, court security, emergency response and “other critical functions that allow local law enforcement to focus on crime reduction efforts.”
The American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico denounced the move, saying that “militarizing civilian law enforcement will lead to civil rights violations and further criminalize homelessness rather than address the root causes of public safety issues.”
The military operation is expected to cost $750,000 per month, the New York Times reported.
Lt. Gov. Howie Morales on April 17 renewed the emergency declaration and authorized another $750,000. Morales was acting governor while Lujan Grisham was traveling to Asia.
Lujan Grisham last Friday renewed the emergency again, and authorized an additional $750,000. Her executive order states that it will remain in effect until the money is spent or no longer needed.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Florida’s only public historic Black university is turning to an ally of top Republicans to lead the institution despite an overwhelming outcry from alumni, who questioned the decision to pick someone with no ties to the school or higher education experience.
The board of trustees for Florida A&M University voted, 8-4, on Friday to tap Marva Johnson as the school’s 13th president. In the same meeting, they voted to increase the salary offered to as much as $750,000, to match Johnson’s desired compensation. 
She still must be confirmed by the Board of Governors of the State University System.
The selection of Johnson continues a trend in Florida of hiring candidates due to their political connections. Florida International University hired former Lieutenant Gov. Jeanette Nuñez as president at Gov. Ron DeSantis’s urging. 
 And Florida Atlantic University trustees emphasized a desire to extract more money from the Legislature plus individual and corporate donors when they selected former GOP lawmaker Adam Hasner as the new FAU president.
Jeanette Nuñez named sole finalist in search for FIU president

DeSantis installs allies at state universities in purge of ‘ideological concepts’

Johnson is a vice president for Charter Communications who was appointed to the state Board of Education by then-Gov. Rick Scott. She holds her undergraduate degree from Georgetown University, a master’s degree from Emory University, and a law degree from Georgia State University.
While supporters of Johnson viewed her as someone whose ties to Republicans could help the school “navigate” a state government and Legislature controlled by the GOP, others questioned the decision.
“In an age of merit-based hiring decisions, how can one justify settling for a candidate who does not meet all of the position criteria, or turning a blind eye to exceptionally qualified candidates?” said Kristin Harper, the FAMU board chair, who backed a different candidate.
FAMU has been without a permanent president since Larry Robinson stepped down last year amid a probe into an embarrassing incident involving a supposed significant donation from a hemp farmer. An investigation concluded that the donation was “fraudulent.” 
The search yielded four finalists, including Washington and FAMU’s current chief operating officer, Donald Palm.
No perfect candidate
Trustee Nicole Washington, a Miami Beach education consultant, contended that “there was no one perfect candidate,” but she defended Johnson.
“The landscape of higher education is changing, and with that the role of the president,” Washington said, citing a recent American Council of Education survey of university presidents indicating that financial management and fundraising topped their job responsibilities.
Academics, Washington said, ranked No. 5 on the list.
“I respect the viewpoints expressed but, respectfully, and it’s proven by data, the skill sets and strategies that we have used to get here may not be the same strategies that it will take to move us forward. And I’m excited for new leadership who is going to be capable of navigating these complex challenges.”
Washington will wind up negotiating a contract with Johnson after the board voted to take away that responsibility from Harper. 
Harper and trustees Zayla Bryant, Belvin Perry Jr., and Craig Reid supported Palm.
Other candidates vying for the position (but who received no support) included Gerald Hector, VP for administration and finance at the University of Central Florida, and Rondall Allen, provost at the University of Maryland Eastern Shore. 
Several of the FAMU trustees commented Friday that the weighty decision of naming the next president kept them up until early hours of the morning, including Trustee Kelvin Lawson, who joked that he was “not watching ESPN but reviewing the videos of the candidates instead.”  He supported Johnson and, like many of the other trustees who voted for her, said he was thinking about what the HBCU (historic black college or university) needs going forward.
“What got us here today won’t get us here tomorrow,” he said.
Negative reaction
But the hire could harm the school in the near term if alumni and others react negatively to the news.
Before the vote, the trustees heard 40 minutes of public debate; none of the speakers supported Johnson’s bid to head FAMU.
“People are tired of the vitriol, negativity, and divisiveness of politics on the national, state, and local level. Don’t do anything that will create even a hint of politically tainted prospects. Because, make no mistake, as tired as we are, a Rattler when backed up against the wall and forced to fight for its own self preservation will strike like hell for its survival,” said FAMU alum and film producer Will Parker, referring to FAMU’s mascot, a rattlesnake. “Do not underestimate the passion of this community.”
The FAMU National Alumni Association endorsed Palm. 
Curtis Johnson, director of the FAMU National Alumni Association, said he was part of the presidential search process representing the alumni. He said the association held town halls and ran surveys to hear from its members. The results showed resounding support for Palm, he said.

SPRINGFIELD — A growing number of state lawmakers are moving to repeal a 2015 Illinois law penalizing companies that boycott Israel to protest its policies toward Palestinians.

Amid concerns about Israel’s ongoing war in Gaza, lawmakers in Springfield supporting human rights for Palestinians have increasingly signed on to legislation opposing the decade-old anti-boycott law. But so far, these bills have stalled.

Illinois’ 2015 law prohibits state pension funds from investing in companies engaging in the Boycott, Divest, Sanction, or BDS, movement against Israel, making Illinois the first U.S. state to enact such legislation, with dozens of other states following suit. The measure, signed into law by Gov. Bruce Rauner, a Republican, was modeled after similar post-9/11 measures restricting Illinois’ pension funds from investment in companies that engage in business with the governments of Iran and Sudan.

When boycotting Israel became grounds for blacklisting, Illinois lawmakers established the Illinois Investment Policy Board, tasked with investigating companies' investment choices. Opponents of the laws have warned they curtail free speech. Israel is the only country for which boycotting is penalized in Illinois by the board.

To repeal this policy, Rep. Abdelnasser Rashid, D-Bridgeview, introduced House Bill 2723, and Sen. Mike Porfirio, D-Bridgeview, introduced Senate Bill 2462 earlier this year. Since then, some 22 co-sponsors were added in the House and Senate, while two of those later had their names removed.

“This is about the right for people to advocate for what they believe — in this particular case, for human rights advocacy — without the state telling you what you have to believe and how you have to act,” said Rashid, the first Palestinian-American to serve in the Illinois House of Representatives. “It is a matter of making sure that Illinois is on the right side of history — not participating in the oppression of the Palestinian people – but it is also about making sure the Illinoisans and companies that do business in Illinois are not being forced and bullied and retaliated against because they chose to stand for human rights.”

Thirty companies are currently on the Illinois Investment Policy Board’s prohibited entity list for boycotting Israel.

In 2021, Unilever, for example, was added to that list after its subsidiary — ice cream company Ben & Jerry’s — announced it would stop selling its products in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, as defined by the United Nations. While remaining a supporter of Israel, the company said it did not support “an internationally recognised illegal occupation.”

Chicago-based investment firm Morningstar narrowly avoided state divestment in 2022, when the Illinois Investment Policy Board accused the firm’s subsidiary, Sustainalytics, of having an anti-Israel bias. The company then commissioned an independent report that found evidence of anti-Israel bias in Morningstar’s standalone product, Human Rights Radar. Morningstar agreed to accept a series of recommendations, including discontinuing the Human Rights Radar and no longer taking input from the United Nations Human Rights Council, in order to avoid state divestment.

Wavering support

While President Trump-supporting Republicans and right-wing activists rail against a bipartisan national bill that would toughen penalties for boycotting Israel’s government, Illinois’ Democratic supermajority legislature appears hesitant to put an end to its 2015 anti-boycott law, which passed unanimously in both houses.

Rashid’s and Porfirio’s bills have stalled in committee despite the initial support from about one-fifth of the Democratic caucus, including the leaders of the Latino, Black and Progressive caucuses.

Thousands of bills, the vast majority of those proposed, get stuck in the Rules Committee every year for various reasons. In HB 2723’s case, the holdup can be attributed in part to the political costs of supporting the bill, advocates said.

Sen. Napoleon Harris, D-Harvey, was listed as a cosponsor on March 20, and Sen. Adriane Johnson, D-Buffalo Grove, signed onto the bill on April 2, but both had their names removed on April 8. Neither senator responded to a request for comment on their reasoning.

Porfirio, the Senate bill’s chief sponsor, and its chief cosponsors — Karina Villa, D-West Chicago; Graciela Guzmán, D-Chicago, and Rachel Ventura, D-Joliet — all declined or failed to respond to requests for comment.

“Even though it had quite an impressive list of sponsors and cosponsors, it's a controversial piece of legislation that is likely to engender a lot of debate that most legislators don't want to vote on, because they either have Jewish or Palestinian constituents, or both,” said Dick Simpson, a professor emeritus at the University of Illinois at Chicago and former Chicago alderman. “Why should they vote on something that isn't going to pass and then cause some constituents to be mad at them?”

But Deanna Othman, member of the Chicago chapter of American Muslims for Palestine, said HB 2723 is urgent, citing both a humanitarian crisis and a crisis of free speech.

“Unfortunately, it's more relevant now than ever, because we've seen all of the crackdown on student protesters and people who engage in boycott and people who are just voicing their First Amendment rights,” Othman said. “If I cannot stand up for the rights of my fellow Palestinians, whose rights can I stand up for?”

‘It’s impossible to tell if this bill will ever pass’

Activists say they are hopeful a repeal of the anti-BDS law will pass in 2026 if it continues to stall this year. But it remains an uphill battle, even as they point to a steady decrease in American popular support for Israel.

About 53% of Americans express an unfavorable opinion of Israel, according to a Pew Research Center study conducted last month. This is an increase from March 2022, when that figure was 42%.

The survey found the share of Americans with little or no trust in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to “do the right thing for global affairs” increased significantly from 2023 to 2024. Since Oct.  7, over 52,000 people in Gaza have been killed in Israeli attacks, according to the Hamas-run Ministry of Health in Gaza. An estimated 1,200 people were killed in Israel during the Hamas’s attacks on Oct.  7, 2023, and around 250 Israelis were taken hostage.

The pro-Israel, pro-peace advocacy group J Street does not oppose boycott initiatives “that explicitly support a two-state solution and recognize Israel’s right to exist,” according to a statement of its policies. “It is critical to maintain the distinction between boycott efforts that work against the interests of Israel, and initiatives which are limited to opposing the occupation. We neither oppose nor call for these initiatives,” the group said in a statement.

But J Street does oppose the broader Global BDS Movement, which advocates for three tenets: That Israel should stop policing the border on and occupying legally Palestinian land, that Arab-Palestinian citizens of Israel should have full equality with Jewish citizens and that Palestinians be allowed to return to their homes, as stipulated in UN Resolution 194.

Lesley Williams, an activist with Evanston Ceasefire who has been lobbying to repeal Illinois’ anti-BDS law, said the three tenets don’t mean “Israel needs to stop existing.”

“That doesn't mean that non-Palestinians should be forced to leave Israel,” she said. “It just says the Palestinians should have equal rights in that territory and that Israel should be following United Nations resolutions.”

The original sponsor of the 2015 anti-BDS law in the House, then Rep. (now Sen.) Sara Feigenholtz, D-Chicago, declined several requests for comment. However, when a 2022 Crain’s Chicago Business op-ed criticized Feigenholtz’s legislation, arguing it was “raising the specter of McCarthy-like scrutiny.” Feigenholtz issued a statement defending her law.

“Israel is the singular democracy in the Middle East that has historically been a consistent ally to the United States,” Feigenholtz said at the time. “Boycotts of Israel, like Ben & Jerry’s/Unilever, are intended to harm and weaken Israel.” She added, “No one’s free speech is curtailed.”

Ben and Jerry’s co-founders Bennett Cohen and Jerry Greenfield, who no longer run the company, denied the boycott was anti-Israel or antisemitic in a 2021 op-ed. They said it was merely a rejection of Israeli policy, and that Ben and Jerry’s was in fact advancing justice and human rights, both “core tenets of Judaism.”

Given the controversy surrounding the Israeli-Palestinian divide, many political obstacles to these current bills passing will probably remain next year. Politicians are less likely to discuss controversial issues like the BDS movement when there’s a supermajority of one party — in Illinois’ case, Democrats — for fear of factionalizing, said Ryan Burge, a political science professor at Eastern Illinois University.

Even if a repeal of the anti-BDS law makes it through the legislature, Gov. JB Pritzker may still be an obstacle, Burge added.

“Pritzker is going to try to run for president in 2028, and he doesn't want anything to happen in the GA that could be used as an albatross on his neck when he runs for the primary in a couple years,” Burge said. Should anti-BDS legislation reach Pritzker’s desk, “The Governor will carefully review this piece of legislation,” the governor’s press secretary, Alex Gough, said in an email.

“It’s impossible to tell if this bill will ever pass, and the reason for that is it's impossible to predict where the Israeli and Palestinian war will be next year,” Simpson said. “I don't know, if Israel does carry through on its threats to move all the Palestinians out of Gaza and to permanently take control, that might provide enough anger to cause it to pass. But it is just predicting.”

(Alaska Energy Authority image)With urban Alaska facing a shortfall in the natural gas long used to generate the vast majority of its power, renewable energy advocates have been pressuring the region’s utilities to advance large-scale wind and solar development to meet future power demands.
But no such projects have been built in the past few years, even with generous tax credits available from the federal government. And now, the utilities are pitching the idea of cutting their dependence on gas by resurrecting a dormant but divisive megaproject: a huge hydroelectric dam along the Susitna River estimated, a decade ago, to cost $5.6 billion.
The pitch, sent to three key budget-writing members of the state House, came earlier in May in a formal letter from the heads of Anchorage-based Chugach Electric Association, Kenai Peninsula-based Homer Electric Association, Fairbanks-based Golden Valley Electric Association, Matanuska Electric Association and Seward’s municipally run electric utility.
[Read the letter]
“In an era when Alaska is facing production declines and difficulty securing natural gas, pursuing energy projects with proven technology, like hydro, provides the utilities with additional generation options while preserving existing natural gas resources,” the executives wrote. They added: “We need multiple options to solve the biggest issue impacting Alaska utilities today: fuel availability.”
The Susitna hydroelectric project has been contemplated, off and on, for decades, before development was suspended by former Gov. Bill Walker in 2016 amid a state budget crisis. 
The project could generate 50% of urban Alaska’s electricity demand, according to the state agency that’s led the study process, the Alaska Energy Authority.
The letter from the utility executives asks the three co-chairs of the House Finance Committee to revive the state’s partially completed efforts to secure a federal license for the project. 
Officials estimate that finishing the licensing process could cost as much as $100 million, on top of some $200 million that’s already been spent.
Lawmakers are nearing the end of their annual budget writing process, and amid declining state revenue, they haven’t added any cash for the hydro project yet.
They’re also still considering legislation to require the utilities to generate higher amounts of power from renewable sources by target dates.
Reached between meetings Wednesday, Anchorage Rep. Calvin Schrage, one of the letter’s recipients, declined to comment.
The utilities’ request to revive the Susitna project is exasperating advocates for other forms of renewable energy, who say that hydroelectric development is economically and politically unrealistic given its huge cost and potential impacts to the river’s yearly runs of hundreds of thousands of salmon.
“It feels like an unfortunate distraction from the urgent work that we need to be doing to secure affordable energy,” said Alex Petkanas, climate and clean energy program manager at the Alaska Center, a conservation group. “We have the studies and the information we need about wind power in Alaska, wind availability in Alaska, and wind reliability. So, to see them spending time on a controversial project rather than pursuing solutions like wind energy that are within our reach feels like a mistake.”
Hydroelectric projects like the Susitna development appeal to utility executives because they provide what’s known as “dispatchable” power — electricity that’s available whenever it’s needed. 
The utilities have expressed more skepticism about wind and solar developments because of their variability, though a recent study commissioned by the utilities found that urban Alaska’s grid could boost its use of wind power seven-fold without jeopardizing reliability.
The next step for the hydroelectric project wouldn’t require the full amount of cash to secure the federal license, said Curtis Thayer, the energy authority’s executive director. Instead, he said, lawmakers would have to budget “a few million dollars” to better understand how much work is needed before the license could be issued. 
“We need to spend a little bit of money to refresh all those numbers to really decide if this is a viable project to move forward,” Thayer said. He asserted that the billions of dollars that would be required for construction is “not an issue,” because private investment firms would finance the project in exchange for guaranteed returns.
For developments that have received federal licenses, “there are people that are standing in line to invest,” Thayer said.
The Susitna proposal faces intense opposition from conservationists and some residents along the river, who say that the development would harm salmon by dramatically reducing water flow in the summer, when power demand is lower, and artificially boosting it during the winter, when demand is high.

	The Susitna River Coalition, a nonprofit that’s led efforts to block the dam, says its construction would cause the “eradication” of the river’s “unique ecosystems, the destruction of one of Alaska’s most valued salmon spawning and rearing habitats, and the flooding of 40,000 acres teeming with wildlife, while costing the state billions of dollars that are needed elsewhere.”
Critics of hydroelectric development point out that elsewhere in the United States, dams are being removed, not built, because of their harmful effects on salmon and other migratory fish species. They also say that construction costs regularly exceed projections.
Opponents of the Susitna project also questioned the process that led to the letter being drafted and sent by the executives of the cooperatively owned utilities, which are governed by citizen boards of directors. 
Those opponents said that not all the utility executives had consulted with board members before the letter was sent — an assertion that two members confirmed to Northern Journal, though they asked to remain anonymous to describe internal conversations.
“Utility staff should not be contacting the Legislature or taking positions without board knowledge or approval,” said Petkanas.
A spokesperson for the largest urban utility, Chugach Electric Association, could not be reached for comment Wednesday, while the spokesperson for the next-largest, Matanuska Electric Association, did not respond to a request for comment.
But Mark Wiggin, board chair of Chugach Electric Association, said he was informed about the letter in advance.
“There’s an overarching interest by all of us to find some way to maintain our energy grid,” Wiggin said. “However we do that, without having to import all that gas, would be a good thing.”

Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer.The Minnesota Court of Appeals will review whether the state may prosecute tribal members for cannabis crimes on most Native reservations in the state, wading into new legal territory after the state legalized recreational cannabis in 2023.
The case involves a White Earth citizen, Todd Thompson, who faces a felony charge for selling marijuana from his tobacco store in Mahnomen on the White Earth reservation.
Mahnomen County sheriff’s deputies and White Earth tribal police raided his store on Aug. 2, 2023, a day after recreational cannabis became legal in Minnesota, and seized about 7.5 lbs of cannabis, 433 grams of marijuana wax and $2,748 in cash along with Thompson’s cell phone and surveillance system.
More than eight months after the raid, Mahnomen County charged Thompson with felony possession, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a $10,000 fine.
Thompson asked Mahnomen County District Judge Seamus Duffy to dismiss the charge, arguing that the state doesn’t have the legal jurisdiction to prosecute him.
Under what’s called Public Law 280, Minnesota has the power to prosecute tribal members on certain reservations including White Earth’s for criminal acts, but not civil or regulatory violations of state law. Thompson and his attorney, Claire Glenn, argued that after cannabis was legalized in Minnesota, possessing and selling the drug became a regulatory matter, not a criminal one.
Thompson also argued that prosecuting him for possession of cannabis violated his rights under the United States’ 1855 Treaty with the Ojibwe, which guarantees the Ojibwe usufructuary rights to hunt, fish and gather on ceded lands.
The district court judge ruled that the state did have jurisdiction, allowing the case to proceed. He held that the matter was criminal and that treaties guarantee rights to tribes, not individuals.
Typically, criminal cases can only be appealed after a conviction, which raised the prospect that Thompson could be forced to go to prison before being able to appeal the judge’s ruling.
Thompson’s attorney, Claire Glenn, asked the Court of Appeals to make an exception and review the jurisdiction matter because his case presents new legal questions that will have implications for Native tribes and tribal members across the state. The appeals court judges agreed.
“A decision on the jurisdiction of the state to enforce Minnesota’s cannabis-possession laws and on the extent of the rights reserved under applicable treaties will have an immediate statewide impact on all Tribes in Minnesota subject to Public Law 280 and on their members,” Chief Judge Jennifer Frisch wrote in the opinion on behalf of herself, and Judges Randall Slieter and Rachel Bond.
Glenn praised the decision, noting how rare it is for the Court of Appeals to intervene in the middle of criminal cases.
“We’re very encouraged by that, but obviously we have a ways to go,” she said.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Senate Majority Leader Frank Ciccone III could be the deciding factor in whether the state passes an assault-style weapons ban this year.
Unless he’s not allowed to be part of the discussion.
The Rhode Island Ethics Commission is slated to issue an advisory opinion at its meeting Tuesday on whether Ciccone’s status as a federal firearms dealer prevents him from participating in deliberations and decisions on gun-related bills. Ciccone, a Providence Democrat, requested the advice of the state ethics panel in an April 30 letter, one day after he was selected Senate majority leader by a majority of his Democratic peers.
Gun bills draw a crowd to R.I. State House for seven and a half hours of testimony

It’s the first time the 77-year-old lawmaker has sought an ethics opinion regarding his ability to influence gun-related policies, despite having served in office since 2003, and held a Class 1 federal firearms license since the 1980s, The Providence Journal reported.
Ciccone did not respond to multiple inquiries for comment Friday.
However, in an April interview, he downplayed the significance of his firearms business, based out of his home in Silver Lake. Ciccone said he only sells one gun per year, usually to a friend or family member. In his letter to the ethics panel, obtained by Rhode Island Current, Ciccone further made the case for why his side hustle should not force him to step out of discussions or votes on gun bills, invoking an exemption within the state’s own ethics laws.
The ethics panel’s response could sway the outcome of the biggest issue on Smith Hill this year. Ciccone has already made it clear he doesn’t support the assault-style weapons ban, at least as drafted by Senate sponsor Lou DiPalma. But Senate President Valarie Lawson is one of the bill’s co-sponsors. 
Lawson and Ciccone serve as ex-officio members on all Senate committees, and could cast tie-breaking votes to determine whether the bill advances out of the 10-member Senate Committee on Judiciary — similar to the power exerted by former Senate President Dominick Ruggerio and former Majority Leader Ryan Pearson to advance a contested abortion access bill to the floor in 2023.
Invokes ‘class exemption’
The ethics code states that there is no substantial conflict of interest if an elected official or person in decision-making authority does not benefit, or lose out, to a “greater extent” than anyone else in their business, profession, occupation or other type of affected group. 
The Ethics Commission has relied on this clause in previous decisions, granting, for example, approval for a state lawmaker who owns a fire alarm installation business to vote on legislation related to credit requirements for fire suppression systems, and for a lawmaker married to a dentist to vote on a bill regulating dentistry. 
Last year, the ethics panel ruled that Lawson, then the Senate majority whip, could vote on pension-related changes despite her job as president of one of the state’s two largest teachers’ unions. It concluded that Lawson would not benefit any more or less from pension changes than the other 68,000 retirees and active state workers and teachers, including 400 of her union co-workers.
The ethics panel in 2002 gave similar advice to Ciccone when he asked for an opinion on potential conflicts on pension bills, given his career with the Laborers’ International Union of North America and participation in the state retirement system.
Ciccone contended the same logic should be applied to his ability to vote on gun bills, noting that there are 70 licensed federal firearms dealers across the state.
“Although this may appear to be a small group, it comprises the entire industry within the State,” Ciccone wrote in his letter. “Consistent with the ‘class exemption’ set forth in [state law], “no substantial conflict exists where the individual members of an entire group are impacted equally.”
Ciccone also wrote that if a separate bill that only impacted a subset of federal firearms dealers were to be brought forward, he would seek a separate advisory opinion, or recuse himself from the vote.
John Marion, executive director for Common Cause Rhode Island, said the size of an affected group is one of several variables considered in a potential conflict of interest. For example, the panel in many prior opinions stressed the importance of “the function or official action being contemplated by the public official” and “the nature and degree of foreseeable impact upon the class and its individual members as a result of the official action,” in determining if a class exemption was applicable. 
“The Ethics Commission’s work is very fact-specific, and without knowing all the facts involved in both legislation and his business, it’s hard to prejudge,” Marion said in an interview. “Like many things in our ethics law, it doesn’t hang on a single number.”
What took him so long?
Noting Ciccone’s long history in state politics and votes on other gun-related bills such as safe storage requirements — signed into law in 2024 despite Ciccone’s vote against it — Marion said Ciccone should have likely sought an ethics opinion years ago.
Especially because Ciccone has run afoul of state ethics rules before. In 2008, Ciccone was fined $1,500 for failing to report his positions as a state senator and a union consultant on 2005 and 2006 financial statements.
However, Marion acknowledged that Ciccone’s recent ascension to the Senate leadership team would warrant a new ethics opinion, even if he’d already requested advice in the past.
Three Democrats who serve on the Senate Judiciary committee voiced opposition to the assault-style weapons ban legislation during a preliminary hearing Wednesday, while a fourth, Republican Sen. Thomas Paolino, has previously indicated he also does not support the bill.
Gov. Dan McKee and House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi are both backing the assault weapons ban, with McKee making his priority clear by also including the policy change in his proposed fiscal 2026 budget.

After being added this week to a miscellaneous education bill, phone-free school legislation could make it to Gov. Phil Scott’s desk by the end of this legislative session.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Ban on smartphones in schools picks up steam in Vermont Legislature.","Stock photo by cottonbro studio via PexelsVermont is on track to join a growing list of states that have banned smartphones from the classroom.This week, lawmakers in a key committee advanced legislation that would require all of the state’s public school districts and independent schools to develop policies prohibiting students from using smartphones and other personal devices like smartwatches during the school day. The policies would need to take effect by the 2026-2027 school year.A school cell phone ban was previously introduced in a standalone bill that has failed to move forward this legislative session. But on Thursday members of the Senate Committee on Education voted to graft the ban onto H.480, a miscellaneous education bill that includes several smaller adjustments to Vermont’s education laws. Now, with broad support in both chambers, lawmakers hope to send the bill to Gov. Phil Scott’s desk by the end of the session. The miscellaneous education bill is expected to soon hit the Senate floor before returning to the House, which needs to approve the new amendment to the bill.  “I feel like I still have to reserve a little caution, because there are still a couple steps, and things can always change,” Rep. Angela Arsenault D-Williston, the lead sponsor of H.54, said in an interview. “But when it passes, I’m going to feel an overwhelming sense of gratitude for everyone involved and making it happen, and relief for our kids and our teachers.”  In Vermont, a broad spectrum of advocates have said that a ban on smartphones and similar devices would go a long way toward alleviating soaring rates of depression, anxiety and other mental health issues among students. “Our students are struggling mentally, socially (and) academically,” Benjamin Clark, a teacher at the Frederick H. Tuttle Middle School in South Burlington, told lawmakers this week while speaking in support of the measure. “And while there are many causes, one cause stands out clearly: the omnipresence of personal technology during the school day.” The legislation would also prohibit schools from using social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram to communicate with students or from otherwise requiring students to have social media to engage in school activities. According to Arsenault, Vermont would be the first state in the country to adopt such a ban. “It’s really a recognition that social media is not good for kids and that schools and educators should not be signaling that it is,” she said.Mounting concerns about the emotional and cognitive impacts of smartphone and social media use among children have fueled a nationwide movement to limit the use of personal devices in schools.Already 21 states have enacted laws either requiring districts to adopt phone-free policies or outright banning phones in public schools statewide. Nine other states, meanwhile, either recommend policies or incentivize districts to ban devices by providing state funding for pilot programs. Many countries have also put into place nation-wide versions of a classroom smartphone ban, including France, Italy, and Brazil. Vermont could follow suit by the end of the year. Assuming lawmaker’s do pass H.480, the bill will go before Republican Governor Phil Scott, who has signalled his interest in taking smartphones out of the classroom.In a written statement, Amanda Wheeler, a spokesperson for Scott, said that although the Governor had not yet reviewed the specific language included in the miscellaneous education bill, he “has generally been supportive of phone-free school policies.” “We often hear phones in the classroom (and in professional settings, for that matter) can be distracting,” Wheeler said, “so by implementing these policies, which some schools have already done, it helps students to focus on learning.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Ban on smartphones in schools picks up steam in Vermont Legislature.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/pexels-cottonbro-studio-5081920-scaled.jpg,,,2025-05-16 15:03:33.190114

Yost said he has enjoyed traveling around the state engaging with Ohioans in his bid to succeed term-limited Governor Mike DeWine, but “it is also apparent that a steep climb to the nomination for governor has become a vertical cliff.”
“I do not wish to divide my political party or my state with a quixotic battle over the small differences between my vision and that of my opponent,” Yost wrote, seeming to refer to fellow candidate Vivek Ramaswamy. “I am simply not that important.”

Yost said the state “has challenges ahead” and Columbus “needs re-engineering, not demolition.” He warned of a “comeback attempt” by former U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown that could “unwind all of the good that the last 15 years of Republican leadership has brought.”
“This is a time to protect Ohio, not a time for a family squabble,” Yost wrote.
Brown has not formally announced any bid for elected office, but former Ohio Department of Health director Amy Acton has already thrown her hat in the ring to vie for the governor’s seat as a Democrat.
Yost, whose term as state attorney general runs until Jan. 2027, plans to “continue to fight for Ohio and Ohioans” for the rest of his tenure, but “I suspect that this is not my final chapter,” he told supporters.

Pinellas County Republican Sen. Nick DiCeglie sponsored the measure. He said it was “personal” for him, having observed homeowners’ frustrations dealing with their local governments in the aftermaths of Hurricanes Helene and Milton last fall.
After the Senate initially passed the bill last month, he issued a statement saying that, following a major storm, citizens need a “clear path to recovery, not roadblocks.”
“When local bureaucracy overshadows the needs of citizens, Floridians are left picking up the pieces,” he said. “We’re fighting for families to focus on rebuilding without additional delays or burdens, especially for those who sustained damage or lost their homes. Working with our state and local responders, we can streamline restoration efforts and improve emergency response coordination, fortifying and strengthening our communities before the next storm.”
The bill contains more than a dozen provisions affecting everything to do with emergency management preparedness and response, as described during a Zoom conference call Thursday organized by the Florida League of Cities,
Perhaps most controversially for local governments is that it prohibits a county or a city located entirely or partially within 100 miles of a hurricane’s track from proposing or adopting moratoriums on construction, reconstruction, or redevelopment of any property.
It also prohibits adopting a “more restrictive or burdensome amendment” or “burdensome procedure” to their comprehensive plans or land development regulations concerning review, approval, or issuance of a site plan, development permit, or development order until Oct. 1, 2027, applied retroactively to Aug. 1, 2024.
“You may be asking what is ‘burdensome’ and what is ‘more restrictive?’ said Matt Singer with the League, who cited a lack of a clear definition as the reason the League opposed the measure.
‘A lot of legal uncertainty’
The bill allows for a “cause of action,” meaning citizens and/or business owners would be able to challenge any local update on the ground that it is burdensome or more restrictive to them.
“And so it’s really, really important that you check this language and see if any of your local updates that have already been made would be affected, and whether’s there’s any liability created there,” Singer said.
“As a result of that, there’s a lot of legal uncertainty,” he said, adding that the League worked closely with DiCeglie and the House bill (HB 1535) sponsor, Sarasota Republican Fiona McFarland, to have that provision removed, but it was ultimately placed back in the House bill.
That provision is already drawing attention from local lawmakers who say that it could prevent them from making changes to prevent future flooding from storms.
“It affects every county and every city in the state that you can’t control the way that you’re developing and the way that you’re managing your own land,” Volusia County Commission Chairman Jeff Brower told WESH-TV in Orlando this week. “And local governments should be doing that.”
Special procedures
The bill requires local governments to develop post-storm permitting plans to expedite recovery and rebuilding by providing for special building permitting and inspection procedures following a hurricane or tropical storm. Plans must include adequate staffing for building inspection, permitting, and enforcement and provide multiple locations offering building permit services.
The measure says that local governments participating in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) may not adopt what is known as a “lookback” period. That means any work completed on a house within a specified period (which can be as long as 5+ years) when determining what counts towards FEMA’s 50% rule. The NFIP’s 50% Rule states that repairs made to a home in a designated flood zone cannot exceed 50% of the home’s market value unless the entire structure is brought into full compliance with current flood regulations.




Singer did tell members of the League that “there are positive things in this bill,” specifically a $5,000 penalty for breach of contract for goods and services during a storm.




“This is in response to some local perspectives that we were able to share with the legislators where cities have had contracts in place with debris removal, and contractors unfortunately just no-show, no-call, and go to another place where they can get some more money,” he said.
“The bottom line here is that Senate bill 180 would reshape many aspects to municipal emergency response across the board, and it imposes a lot of new planning and publication duties,” Singer added.
The measure has yet to be sent to Gov. DeSantis desk.

(Amy Dalrymple/North Dakota Monitor)Greenpeace wants a North Dakota judge to reduce the nearly $667 million in damages it was ordered to pay the developer of the Dakota Access Pipeline in March, arguing that the award is excessive and unreasonable.
A Morton County jury handed down the sum following a more than three-week trial earlier this year. Jurors found the environmental group at fault for damages related to protests against the pipeline in North Dakota in 2016 and 2017, and for publishing defamatory statements that harmed Energy Transfer’s business.
Greenpeace was one of many activist groups that backed the movement, which drew thousands to rural south-central North Dakota to protest in solidarity with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe.
Greenpeace denies Energy Transfer’s allegations and says the company only brought the lawsuit to chill environmental activism. The defendants have yet to appeal.
In the meantime, attorneys for Greenpeace have asked Southwest Judicial District Judge James Gion to slash the nearly $667 million award, claiming it exceeds statutory caps on damages and that the verdict is riddled with inconsistencies.
“This is the poster child of where the court needs to step in,” Steven Caplow, an attorney representing Greenpeace, said in a Thursday morning remote hearing.
 

Energy Transfer says Gion should let the jury’s award stand. Trey Cox, an attorney representing the pipeline developer, called the damages “consistent with the evidence produced at trial and the law of the state of North Dakota.”
In North Dakota, a punitive damage award cannot exceed two times the compensatory damage award, or the amount granted to make up for financial losses a party suffered.
Greenpeace and Energy Transfer disagree as to whether the verdict meets this requirement. Caplow argued that the punitive damages must be reduced by roughly $43 million to be consistent with state law, while Cox said the damages don’t exceed the cap and ought to be left in place.
Greenpeace also claims the award includes costs that should actually be attributed to Energy Transfer or other third parties. Greenpeace maintains it only had six employees visit the protest camps, and that its presence was small compared to the many other activist groups that supported the movement.
Caplow argued that Energy Transfer without sufficient evidence is holding Greenpeace responsible for all damages the company incurred in connection to the protests. He said the award unfairly compensates Energy Transfer for expenses it sustained before any Greenpeace employees set foot in North Dakota, for example.
Greenpeace also alleges the jury form — which the jurors had to fill out to issue their verdict — was flawed in a way that inflated the damages attributed to the environmental group.
Before the jurors deliberated, Gion directed them to consider whether each damage Energy Transfer claimed was directly caused by Greenpeace, or whether and to what extent they resulted from the actions of another group. Despite this being part of the instructions, there wasn’t space on the form for the jury to conduct this analysis, Caplow said.
That meant jurors were deprived of an opportunity to voice whether they believe Energy Transfer or other groups shared responsibility for any of the $667 million award, Caplow argued.
Cox said Greenpeace could have proposed changes to the form to address this issue, but didn’t.
Greenpeace also asked Gion to remove hundreds of millions of dollars of defamation-related damages, claiming the award is not supported by the evidence presented at trial. The jury awarded Energy Transfer damages for statements Greenpeace published about the pipeline between November 2016 and June 2018.
The environmental group maintains that none of the statements are defamatory, but also says that even if they were, they cannot be held solely responsible for defamation. Greenpeace says the statements originated with other sources — including the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe — and were circulated by hundreds of other outlets well before it published anything about the pipeline.
Additionally, Greenpeace says a significant portion of the $667 million includes compensation for damages Energy Transfer did not formally request relief for, including some Greenpeace says the company referenced during trial but didn’t claim in its written complaint.
Energy Transfer disputes the notion that Gion has discretion to reduce the jury’s award.
Energy Transfer’s lawsuit is against three Greenpeace entities — Greenpeace USA, Greenpeace International and Greenpeace Fund. Greenpeace USA was found at fault for most of the claims brought by Energy Transfer. The jury did not find Greenpeace International and Greenpeace Fund responsible for on-the-ground harms committed by protesters, though it did find those entities responsible for defamation and interfering with Energy Transfer’s business. Additionally, the jury found Greenpeace USA and Greenpeace International liable for conspiracy.
Matt Kelly, an attorney representing Greenpeace Fund, said during Thursday’s hearing that the award against the organization should be tossed out. The jury ordered Greenpeace Fund to pay roughly $130 million despite the fact that it did not find the organization at fault for most of the major claims in the case, Kelly said.
“We were forced to litigate for seven years on claims where there was no basis for any liability against Greenpeace Fund,” Kelly said during the hearing. “The idea that we should be forced to bear those costs, at this point, is ridiculous.”
Greenpeace International in court filings argued similarly that the nearly $132 million in damages it was ordered to pay should be dropped.
Energy Transfer says that the awards are valid because the jury found both of the organizations at fault for interfering with the company’s business.
Gion took the motion under advisement. Greenpeace in separate motions has asked Gion to fully reverse the jury’s verdict. The parties are scheduled to reconvene for another hearing on May 27.
Greenpeace USA has announced its intent to appeal the verdict to the North Dakota Supreme Court.

Both U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Ann Arbor) and U.S. Rep. John James (R-Shelby Township) sit on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which passed the bill Wednesday. Dingell voted no, while James voted yes.
“I especially worry about how senior Michiganders will fare under the legislation Congressman James voted for this week,” said Dr. Christine Crader, a palliative medicine physician from St. Clair Shores, which is in James’ district. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Crader was among physicians from across the country, including from Colorado, Iowa, and New Jersey, who spoke during a virtual press event Thursday to criticize their representatives for voting for the bill in committee and urge them to cease any further support for the legislation. 
The event was sponsored by the Committee to Protect Health Care, a PAC that supports an expanded health care system.
Crader says the legislation won’t just result in depriving Medicaid recipients of health care coverage, it will also raise health care costs for many people, including seniors.

“Many poor, older and disabled people are enrolled in Medicare but use Medicaid to cover copayments they cannot afford. So if their Medicaid is taken away, as it could be under the legislation Congressman James voted for, these seniors and disabled people might not be able to pay their co-payments or other costs,” Crader said.
Michigan Democratic Party Curtis Hertel was less restrained in his criticism, calling James “a disgrace” to the state and the millions of Michiganders that rely on Medicaid. 
“The worst part is, all of these cuts that rip away health care from people who need it, is all to give the richest 1% yet another tax break,” Hertel said. 
A request was sent by Michigan Advance to James’ office, but has yet to be returned.
However, James, who is a Republican candidate for governor in 2026, has said in the past that Republicans are working to protect Medicaid from insolvency to “ensure those who’ve rightfully paid into their benefits & our most vulnerable can access these essential programs.” 
An analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office indicates that the proposed Medicaid changes would cut $625 billion in federal spending over the next decade, resulting in approximately 10.3 million people losing access to either Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program. Additionally, 7.6 million people would become uninsured during the 10-year budget window.
Michigan League for Public Policy President and CEO Monique Stanton said the cuts being made to Medicaid spending as well as to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program are part of an overall tax plan that would increase deficits by $3.8 trillion over 10 years, 
“To put life-saving programs like Medicaid and SNAP on the chopping block in order to create tax cuts that mainly benefit the wealthy is egregious,” Stanton said.

“Everything that we know is critical to Michigan’s growth — bringing down maternal mortality rates, making sure older folks can afford their prescriptions, making sure kids and families have the nutrition they need — that’s all at stake now. And for what? To make sure more wealthy people get a tax cut,” Stanton said.
Also criticizing the proposed cuts to the Medicaid program is Danielle Atkinson, executive director and founder of Mothering Justice, a Michigan-based policy organization.
“These proposed funding cuts Republicans are trying to push through would devastate working-class families and mamas of color in Michigan. This is a class war being declared on some of our most vulnerable populations by out-of-touch politicians who won’t be impacted by this political malpractice. I call on the Michigan congressional delegation to vote against these cuts, and to step up and protect low-income families and communities of color,” Atkinson told the Advance.
A major piece of the Republican-sponsored legislation is the implementation of work requirements for those on Medicaid, which the CBO estimates would save more than $300 billion over the next ten years. Democrats have countered that the vast majority of recipients work full or part-time, and the savings will be realized through red tape that will cut off benefits to those who otherwise qualify.
Crader says she has seen that first-hand among her patients.
“We had challenges in Michigan when people had to reconfirm and go through all of the paperwork to qualify again for Medicaid and I had at least two patients in my clinic who for a period of time were without insurance and were worried that they were not going to be able to see me as a physician, that they were not going to be able to pay for pain medications that they were taking for Stage 4 cancer,” Crader said.
She also said while the political battle plays out in Washington D.C., many of her patients don’t yet grasp the changes the proposed legislation will bring.
“I don’t feel that my patient population really understands the impact of these Medicaid cuts. I’m not sure they believe it will actually happen because all of them wonder how could humans do this to other humans,” Crader said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-16-140430.png,,,2025-05-16 14:11:00.445357

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — In what appeared to be a campaign stump speech in all but name only, state Superintendent Ryan Walters called to eliminate Oklahoma’s income tax and property tax and said the state should stop increasing funding for public schools.
Walters, who leads the statewide public education system, said Oklahoma should slash administrative spending across state government. Finding these efficiencies, he claimed, would make up for the many millions of dollars public schools would lose if the state stops collecting income and property taxes.
“People love to throw around how much money you spend in education,” Walters said in a surprise news conference at the state Capitol on Friday. “I don’t want to be a leader in how much money we spend on education. I’ll make that clear. I do not want to be that leader.”

Walters, a Republican long thought to be a potential gubernatorial candidate, spent much of the news conference criticizing the state budget Gov. Kevin Stitt and legislative leaders announced Wednesday. He took questions from reporters for 40 minutes while a small group of his supporters cheered him on.
When asked directly whether he intends to run for governor, Walters said that’s a “question I’ll look at over the summer.” 
If Walters launches a campaign, he would join a 2026 Republican primary race of Attorney General Gentner Drummond, former House Speaker Charles McCall, former state Sen. Mike Mazzei and Leisa Mitchell Haynes, of Choctaw. House Minority Leader Cyndi Munson, D-Oklahoma City, is the only non-Republican in the race to succeed Stitt, who will be term-limited.
“My focus is the school year and this legislative session,” Walters said. “We still have time this legislative session to get it right.”
The offices of House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, and Senate President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle, declined to comment on Walters’ remarks. The Governor’s Office did not return a request for comment.
Their $12.6 billion budget deal cuts the state’s top income tax bracket by .25% and eliminates three lower tax brackets — a measure Walters said doesn’t go far enough to support working Oklahomans. Stitt had urged lawmakers to cut the income tax by a half a percentage and to chart a path to eliminating the income tax altogether.
The budget includes a 3.15% increase to the Oklahoma State Department of Education’s budget and gives $25 million more to public schools.
Despite saying on Friday that he wants “less money going to our agency,” Walters had asked at the beginning of the legislative session for a 2.43% funding increase to the education budget.

He had specifically requested $3 million to buy Bibles for public school classrooms, $1 million for a new teacher induction program, $1 million to recruit military veterans and former law enforcement officers to become teachers, and $500,000 to give educators concealed-carry firearms training. None of these proposals made it into the state budget that lawmakers and the governor crafted.
However, state leaders agreed to boost a teacher maternity leave fund by $4 million and to dedicate $5 million to high-dosage tutoring for reading and math, an initiative inspired by a program Walters established.
Every Oklahoma classroom will be stocked with a Bible, Walters said, even without any state funding to buy them. He said his administration has been collecting donated copies and already purchased more than 500 Bibles with agency funds.
His new state standards for social studies education requires schools to teach biblical stories and the teachings of Jesus that inspired historical figures in American history.
“The Bible is going to be in every classroom this fall,” he said. “The legislature can put the money there or not.”

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)Some health care workers and other Iowans opposed to proposed cuts to Medicaid and SNAP being discussed by U.S. House Republicans criticized Iowa’s federal delegation as they work on the committees tasked with moving those proposals forward.
U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks is a member of the House Energy and Commerce committee, the body that voted 30-24 Wednesday along party lines to approve the bill making billions in cuts to federal spending that could include work requirements and other restrictions on Medicaid. According to analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the changes in the bill would cut $625 billion in federal spending over the next 10 years.
Physicians in the Committee to Protect Health Care urged House members from their districts, including Miller-Meeks, to oppose the House GOP’s budget bill and criticized them for supporting the measure. Dr. Brian Lindsay, an internal medicine physician from Cedar Rapids, said in a statement that Miller-Meeks, who is also a physician, “must be familiar with the tragic stories doctors witness every day when people aren’t able to access or afford health care.”
“As physicians, we challenge politicians like Congresswoman Miller-Meeks to explain how taking away her own constituents’ health care makes their lives better or our community stronger,” Lindsay said in a statement. “When people can’t see a doctor or afford to get the treatment they need, people suffer, some go bankrupt because of huge medical bills and unfortunately, some people die. Every Iowan must stand up and speak out against this reckless Republican plan to take away people’s ability to get medical care so politicians can give huge handouts to billionaires.”
Eric Kusiak, a nurse manager in Iowa’s 1st congressional district, said the cuts could put rural Iowa hospitals at risk of closing in a statement with Fairness for Iowa, a liberal coalition that supports unseating Miller-Meeks and U.S. Rep. Zach Nunn, Iowa Republicans in potentially vulnerable seats heading into the 2026 election.
“With these cuts, patients would get sicker, have fewer places to go, and have fewer healthcare workers to care for them,” Kusiak said. “House Republicans and Miller-Meeks voted to take health care from millions of people including seniors, kids, and veterans to pay for more tax giveaways to the wealthy and corporations.”
Miller-Meeks said in a post on social media Wednesday that Democratic Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden “made the rules, then broke” Medicaid, and the House GOP plan will “fix” the health coverage program. “Medicaid is for the most vulnerable low-income families, pregnant women, kids, seniors and the disabled — not illegal immigrants or able-bodied men who choose not to work,” Miller-Meeks wrote.
Nunn and U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra of Iowa are on the U.S. House Agriculture Committee, that was similarly tasked with finding spending cuts to make to federal programs including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Approved 29-25 Wednesday, the bill moved forward by the committee will shift some portions of SNAP funding to states for the first time.
In a video posted on social media Wednesday, Nunn defended his support of the measure, saying voters have “heard a lot of spin about what’s happening with SNAP.” He pointed to the resolution he proposed earlier in May, the “Defending Medicaid and SNAP Resolution,” as a step he has taken to ensure SNAP benefits are not cut for seniors, pregnant women, children and people with disabilities.
“Now, here’s what I’m also going to do: I’m going to make sure these systems are successful now and into the future, fighting getting rid of the fraud, waste and abuse,” Nunn said. “And that means making sure that able-bodied individuals are working at least part-time jobs, and states that have had massive error rates are held accountable so they can correct that for the future.”
He said these changes will provide more money for the program in the future to allow “vulnerable Iowans get the assistance they need” through SNAP in the future.
However, Democrats and others involved in food assistance programs said the cuts will hurt Iowans who rely on SNAP to purchase food for their families. Iowa House Minority Leader Jennifer Konfrst, who is running as a Democratic candidate in the 3rd District, said Thursday Nunn was “screwing over farmers and families” with his support for the bill.
“I wanted to rest up a little bit this morning, but I can’t, because I’m so angry,” Konfrst said, referring to the overnight debate leading to the end of the 2025 legislative session at the Iowa Capitol. “Zach Nunn has the opportunity to do the right thing and do what’s best for families, farmers, and veterans back here in Iowa. But instead, he did what he always does, which is fall in line with his party bosses and vote to devastate his own district. “
Feenstra, who also serves on the House Ways and Means Committee, said he supported the bill because it lowers taxes for Iowa families, farmers, workers and businesses “while supporting investments in domestic manufacturing, business growth, Iowa agriculture, and U.S. energy production.”
“I’m also glad that provisions that I led are included like death tax relief, paid family and medical leave for employees of small businesses, affordable crop insurance policies for young and beginning farmers, investments in foreign animal disease prevention, and expansion of our export markets,” Feenstra said in a statement. “Working with President Trump, we are delivering on our promise to the American people to cut taxes, grow our economy, secure our border, and unleash American energy production.”
Feenstra announced he was launching an exploratory committee for a gubernatorial run Tuesday after filing paperwork for a run the day earlier. Iowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart said Feenstra’s decision to support the budget bill making cuts to SNAP is a sign that Iowans should not support him to become the state’s next governor.
“Iowans need a governor that works for them,” Hart said in a statement. “While many Iowans are struggling to afford groceries and Iowa is ranked 49th in the nation in economic growth and 48th in personal income, Randy Feenstra voted today to gut SNAP – which is a program that more than 260,000 Iowans rely on and generates economic activity that impacts our farmers, grocers, truck drivers and more. … Randy Feenstra also voted to approve tax cuts for billionaires and the nation’s top 1 percent. Feenstra put requests from greedy billionaires over the needs of Iowans today and showed his priorities are not the same as the Iowa folks he seeks to govern.”
While Iowa’s federal delegation voted in support of these measures, the House budget committee voted 16-21 Friday to reject the spending package that includes the cuts to Medicaid and SNAP. Alongside Democrats, four Republicans, US. Reps. Josh Brecheen of Oklahoma, Andrew Clyde of Georgia, Ralph Norman of South Carolina and Lloyd Smucker of Pennsylvania, voted against the measure while calling for steeper budget cuts to be included.
Though the measure has stalled, budget negotiations are continuing as House Republicans aim to approve a measure next week before the end of next week, when U.S. representatives are set to leave Washington, D.C. for a week-long recess.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/capitolshutt-scaled-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-16 14:11:00.445357

“We’re losing gallons of water from pipe leaks,” said Charles Hill, city council member in Starbuck.
With an aging population and limited revenue, Starbuck – a town of fewer than 200 people along the Tucannon River in Columbia County – faces mounting infrastructure challenges, particularly in its water and sewer systems. Jody Opheim, executive director of Partners for Rural Washington, a nonprofit that supports rural communities across the state, said the pilot project, called “Rural Opportunity, Advancement, and Resilience,” will help Starbuck and eight other rural towns secure funding and technical assistance for critical improvements.
Palouse, another eastern Washington town, also has been selected to complete a comprehensive upgrade to its wastewater system.
Opheim estimates at least 24 months of completion for most of the projects.
“We’re looking at different ways of financing these projects, beyond the big federal dollars,” Opheim said.
Opheim said they are working alongside the Washington Department of Commerce, Association of Washington Cities, Washington State University Extension and the Washington U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Development office to help meet the rural towns’ needs.
She emphasized that while participation doesn’t come with guaranteed funding, each community will receive expert and technical support at no cost.
“Our project managers will herd this process, manage this process, do follow up, make connections, facilitate and then where there isn’t other technical assistance available to look for funding sources,” Opheim said. “This is very much a group effort. It’s a big lift, but we’ve got lots of good core partners and affiliates that we will bring to that community table.”
Staci Nelson, grant services director for the nonprofit, said the group has worked with Starbuck before and identified the water system as a top concern.
She explained the town has two water tanks, one built in 1965 and the other in 1986, which are where their drinking water comes from.
“They need to have the interior of their water tanks re-coated and so we’re going through that process of helping to try and find some resources for them,” Nelson said. “And in addition to the water tanks, they have pipes that need to be replaced due to their leaking.”
Hill said the rural town has lost more than 12 million gallons of water in the last year because of the leaks in the pipes. He expects that number to increase as pipe leaks continue.
He also noted that one of Starbuck’s wells has stopped functioning.
“We do hear from people that there’s pieces of metal, you know, rustic pipe in their water downstream of where some of these leaks are, because the pipes are completely corroded,” Hill said. “I’ve also seen it in some of my water here.”
“It has been an emergency,” he said.
He said that many wheat farmers rely on the town’s water system to care for their livestock, irrigate crops, and water orchards – further stressing the need for immediate action.
“There are a lot of people, a lot of farmers, that use the water in town for their cows,” Hill said.
Nelson said Palouse, a town of about 1,000 residents, is facing similar major water quality upgrades to its wastewater system – a project estimated to cost $23 million.
The cost is largely due to the town’s proximity to the Palouse River, where any water quality issue could lead to contamination, she said. The project has a 2030 completion deadline.
Tim Sievers, mayor of Palouse, said the town needs to meet regulations regarding their wastewater discharge. Palouse’s clean effluent flows into the Palouse River, but the temperature is too high during certain periods of the year, which causes environmental implications for the river ecosystem, he said.
“Secondarily, we have a regulation coming down with our 2030 permit about the levels of dissolved organic nitrogen that is in our effluent. So we’re taking steps to address those concerns from our environmental regulators,” Sievers added.
Critical rural infrastructure upgrades often are overlooked, Nelson said.
“For us to be able to continue to support those smaller communities, it makes the entire part of Eastern Washington, as well as the state of Washington more successful,” Nelson said.
Sievers said the partnership for Palouse will be an important step forward in continuing to grow the rural town.
Hill said they are optimistic and hopeful working with the nonprofit, after years off feeling the town has been “left out” of community development needs.
“Many of us wear multiple hats. One of our farmers volunteers his tractor to cut and dig up the ground to replace a pipe. I’ve been on the council for a little over two years now and I don’t get paid. I mean it’s all volunteer work,” Hill said. “We need help.”

Free.,"U.S. House right wing tanks Trump’s 'big, beautiful bill' in Budget Committee","Ashley Murray, Jennifer Shutt",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-right-wing-tanks-trumps-big-beautiful-bill-budget-committee,,"WASHINGTON — Republicans suffered a major setback to their “big, beautiful bill” on Friday, when amid conservative objections the U.S. House Budget Committee failed to approve the measure, a crucial step in the process.In a 16-21 vote, Reps. Andrew Clyde of Georgia, Josh Brecheen of Oklahoma, Ralph Norman of South Carolina, Chip Roy of Texas and Lloyd Smucker of Pennsylvania broke from their GOP colleagues to block the bill from moving toward the floor, demanding changes to several provisions.The breakdown over the 1,116-page bill marks an escalation in the long-running feud between centrist Republicans, who have been cautious about hundreds of billions in spending cuts to safety net programs, and far-right members of the party, who argue the changes are not enough.The committee could return later to take up the bill again, though it was not immediately clear when that might be. House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana has said he wants it on the floor prior to the Memorial Day recess.Speedier work requirementsNorman said he remains a “hard no” until new work requirements for Medicaid recipients phase in more quickly. As the bill is written, the requirements won’t begin until 2029.“To phase this in for four years — We're telling a healthy-bodied, a healthy American that you got four years to get a job. No, your payment stops now,” Norman said.Brecheen criticized the bill for not going far enough to repeal wind and solar energy tax credits, which he contends are “undermining natural gas jobs.”“We have to fix this,” he said.Clyde denounced the measure for not adhering to President Donald Trump’s promise of “right-sizing government,” as Clyde described it. The Georgia Republican also pleaded for lower taxes on firearms and stronger cuts that would put Medicaid on a “sustainable path.”“Unfortunately, the current version falls short of these goals and fails to deliver the transformative change that Americans were promised,” Clyde said.Smucker initially voted ‘yes,’ but then joined his four colleagues to oppose the measure.Trump wrote on his social media platform shortly before the committee voted that “Republicans MUST UNITE behind, ‘THE ONE, BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL!’”“We don’t need ‘GRANDSTANDERS’ in the Republican Party. STOP TALKING, AND GET IT DONE! It is time to fix the MESS that Biden and the Democrats gave us. Thank you for your attention to this matter!”‘A wrecking ball to Medicaid’Democrats, who as expected unified in voting no against the bill, slammed it as “ugly,” “cruel” and a “betrayal.”“This bill takes a wrecking ball to Medicaid, on which 1 in 5 Americans and 3 million Ohioans depend for medical care — children, seniors in nursing homes,” said Rep. Marcy Kaptur, who represents northern Ohio. “Please come with me to visit the nursing homes. … Perhaps too many on the other side of the aisle have not had to endure a life that has major challenges.”Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota said the proposed cuts to safety net programs would be “devastating.”“Their changes will kick millions of Americans off their health care and nutrition assistance. That means more untreated illnesses, more hungry children, more preventable deaths,” she said.Republican-only billRepublicans are using the complex reconciliation process to move the package through Congress with simple majority votes in each chamber, avoiding the Senate’s 60-vote legislative filibuster, which would otherwise require bipartisanship. Reconciliation measures must address federal revenue, spending, or the debt limit in a way not deemed “merely incidental” by the Senate parliamentarian. That means the GOP proposals must carry some sort of price tag and cannot focus simply on changing federal policy.Republicans are using the package to extend the 2017 tax law, increase spending on border security and defense by hundreds of billions of dollars, overhaul American energy production, restructure higher education aid and cut spending.The 11 House committees tasked with drafting pieces of the legislation have all debated and approved their measures along party lines.The Agriculture Committee, Energy and Commerce Committee and Ways and Means Committee all completed their work earlier this week, amid strong objections from Democrats.Proposed changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, could shift considerable cost-sharing onto states for the first time, presenting challenges for red-state lawmakers who need to explain the bill back home.More than $600 billion in federal spending cuts to Medicaid during the next decade could also cause some difficulties for moderate Republicans, some of whose constituents are likely to be among the millions of Americans expected to lose their health insurance.Republicans also have yet to reach an agreement on the state and local tax deduction or SALT, a priority for GOP lawmakers from blue states like California, New Jersey and New York.The Budget Committee’s role in the process was to package together all of the bills and then send the one massive bill to the Rules Committee, the last stop before floor debate for major legislation.That won’t be able to happen until after GOP leaders get nearly all the Republican lawmakers on the panel to support the package.",,,,2025-05-16 14:11:00.445357

In a tale of two verdicts, a jury acquitted former House Speaker Glen Casada but convicted his ex-top aide on corruption charges tied to a secretive political vendor.
The 12-person jury found Casada guilty of 17 counts of fraud, bribery, theft, conspiracy and money laundering and Cothren, who left his chief of staff post amid a racist and sexist texting scandal in 2019, guilty on all 19 counts of fraud, stemming from his bogus signature of “Matthew Phoenix” on a federal W-9 tax form and state direct deposit document.
Casada and Cothren were accused of setting up a secret company called Phoenix Solutions that tapped into the state’s postage and printing program that provides House members $3,000 a year for constituent mailers. Casada and former Rep. Robin Smith, who pleaded guilty and testified against the pair, steered lawmakers’ business to Phoenix Solutions, which was secretly run by Cothren with the front name of “Matthew Phoenix.”

Lawmakers such as Reps. Jay Reedy and Esther Helton-Haynes and former Rep. Patsy Hazlewood testified they wouldn’t have allowed Phoenix Solutions to do their mailers if they had known Cothren was running the company. In late 2019 and early 2020, Cothren was considered a liability because he had been forced to resign, just three months before Casada stepped down from his Speaker’s post after a no-confidence vote by the House Republican Caucus.
Federal prosecutors displayed several text messages and emails showing Cothren told Smith and Casada to keep his name off of documents. Smith testified that they hatched the plan in a meeting at an upscale Nashville bar in 2019. She came up with the name of “Phoenix” because she felt Cothren and Casada should be able to arise from political ashes.
The company generated $52,000 in revenue from constituent mailers for about 10 lawmakers, money that Smith described as “low-hanging fruit.” They tapped into campaign and Republican Caucus money, as well. But most of the trial dealt with the use of tax dollars.
The trial’s outcome brings to a close a five-year ordeal that started with the FBI probing lawmakers after the 2019 tie vote on the state’s education savings account program for low-income students in Metro Nashville, Memphis and, subsequently, Chattanooga.
Casada and Cothren didn’t testify in their own defense, nor did House Speaker Cameron Sexton, who has been cooperating with federal authorities. The defense raised questions in court documents about whether Sexton or someone in his office wore a wire to record conversations with lawmakers.
The FBI raided the homes of Cothren, Casada and Smith as well as Rep. Todd Warner and other offices on Jan. 8, 2021. A year and a half later, they indicted Casada, Smith and Cothren on a litany of kickback charges.

DFL-St. Paul, and DFL caucus members outline their focus and work ahead for the 2025 session at a press conference February 10, 2025. Photo by A.J. Olmscheid/ Senate Media Services.Progressives are outraged that Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, Senate Majority Leader Erin Murphy and House leader Melissa Hortman agreed to a budget deal that will strip health insurance from undocumented adults who became newly eligible for the coverage on Jan. 1 
Here’s Minneapolis City Councilmember Jason Chavez: 
I’m extremely disappointed … They made a deal with the GOP to strip away health care from undocumented residents.
Chavez takes particular aim at Murphy, hinting at a potential primary challenge. “We won’t forget that your re-election is next year.”  
The anger is understandable. At the end of the year, at least 15,000 Minnesotans will be kicked off MinnesotaCare — a public insurance program for the working poor created by then-Republican Gov. Arnie Carlson — if the deal passes. Only undocumented children will still be able to access coverage.
These adults will no longer get routine care, which will worsen chronic conditions or allow undiagnosed conditions to fester. They’ll go to emergency rooms for care. Minnesota hospitals, which favor keeping the program’s eligibility intact, will be forced to provide more uncompensated care. 
The Minneapolis-St. Paul Archdiocese Auxiliary Bishop Kevin Kenney offered some moral clarity on the subject recently: “We need to be able to offer health care to anyone who is here, no matter how they got here, who let them in. Are we going to let them die on the streets? Are we going to let them suffer? Or are we going to allow them — all of us — the basic health care that we need?”
But Chavez’s “extremely disappointed” attack is wildly misplaced. 
Walz, Murphy and Hortman share power with Republican House Speaker Lisa Demuth, for whom cutting the MinnesotaCare benefit is a top priority, perhaps her most important priority. 
Walz, Murphy and Hortman had to consider the repercussions of a stalemate that could lead to a government shutdown July 1. Which would be devastating to everyone who relies on state government for services, which is basically all of us — but especially our most vulnerable. 
I suspect most progressives in the Legislature know this, which is why at least so far, we’re not hearing widespread threats to withhold votes to stop the deal, except on the health budget bill that will include the MinnesotaCare provision. Their opposition on that vote will be mostly symbolic, as Murphy should have no problem wrangling some Republican votes. 
(Caveat: It’s a fluid situation, and progressives may wind up risking a shutdown to fight for MinnesotaCare for undocumented people. That’s a difficult choice; let’s hope they make it with eyes wide open.) 
We should also remember what Walz, Murphy and Hortman have managed to protect: paid family and medical leave; earned sick and safe time; and unemployment benefits for hourly school workers, which were three significant achievements of the 2023 Legislature. They’ve also protected schools and social service programs from draconian cuts, despite the state’s structural deficit.  
Instead of the circular firing squad, Democrats might consider who the real culprit here is: Republicans who have made taking subsidized health care away from working people a primary policy goal. 
Why not turn your fire on them? State Sen. Jordan Rasmusson, R-Fergus Falls, is out here bragging in a press release about how he’s “been at the forefront” of taking people’s health care. 
Rep. Elliott Engen, R-White Bear Township, told a a Democratic senator to “cry harder” for caring about people losing their health care. 
If you want to get mad at Democrats, get mad that they lost control of the House last year, which is what allowed taking health care away from working people to rise to the top of the issue agenda. 
Which means getting mad at former President Joe Biden for running for a second term. And getting mad at Kamala Harris for running a lackluster campaign. And getting mad at Minnesota Democrats for running behind Harris in enough districts to lose the House. 
And when it comes to winning the next election, ill-informed attacks on people trying to govern aren’t helpful either.

Mike Kehoe discusses the 2025 legislative session with reporters in his Capitol office on Friday (Jason Hancock/Missouri Independent).Missouri lawmakers will return to Jefferson City next month for a special session to debate providing tax breaks to keep the Kansas City Chiefs and Royals in the state, Gov. Mike Kehoe said in a news conference Friday morning.
The special session could also consider a $500 million spending bill for construction needs around the state, he said, but a final decision has not been made.
In the final days of the regular session, which ended Thursday, Kehoe unveiled a plan to use tax revenue generated by the Chiefs and Royals to finance bonds for their stadiums. The Chiefs would use the money to upgrade Arrowhead Stadium while the Royals would use it for a new stadium in Missouri.
Despite the late reveal, the Missouri House passed the proposal on a 108-40 vote. But the Senate balked at the deal, with many members saying they could not support it because a $513 million capital construction bill died when the Missouri House refused to allow it to come up for a vote.
Kehoe did not see the delay of the stadium proposal as a final defeat.
“We introduced that in the last week of the session to try to find what the feelings were,” he said.
The exact date for the special session has not been determined, Kehoe said.
The Chiefs and the Royals face a deadline at the end of June on whether they will accept an offer from Kansas to pay 70% of the cost of building new stadiums in that state. The proposal floated by Kehoe would pay up to half the cost as well as up to $50 million in tax credits for any direct investments made by the teams.
Remodeling Arrowhead and building a new baseball stadium would cost up to $3 billion, Kehoe said. 
“I would consider that significant economic development,” Kehoe said of the stadiums, comparing them to manufacturing projects that won incentives from lawmakers in the past
Stadium funding, gun rights law among casualties of Missouri Senate breakdown

Missouri House Minority Leader Ashley Aune, a Kansas City Democrat, said she agrees that the state should work to keep the Chiefs and Royals from moving to Kansas but blamed Kehoe for the late introduction of his plan for the need to hold a special session.
“We are at this point because Governor Kehoe committed gross legislative malpractice by springing his stadium plan on lawmakers with no warning and just days left in the regular session without bothering to first build support for it,” Aune said.
The hurdles for a successful special session are both political and financial. The stadium plan died in the regular session when the Senate twice used a rare procedural rule to end debate on controversial bills on abortion and sick leave rights.
The move infuriated Democrats, who vowed the Senate will not function normally until they feel they can trust the GOP to work towards compromise.
“I’ve heard a long time, ‘well, nobody has ever made us pay.’” Senate Minority Leader Doug Beck, an Affton Democrat said at a news conference Wednesday. “You’ll find out now.”
Complicating the debate is lingering anger over the projects that were lost when the House sunk the capital improvements bill. The $513 million would have paid for projects at eight hospitals around the state, supported a new nuclear reactor at the University of Missouri to make cancer treatments and a new mental health hospital in Kansas City.
In all, more than 60 projects added by lawmakers, in addition to more than 20 sought by Kehoe, will not be funded.
One of the biggest boosters of the Chiefs and Royals, state Sen. Barbara Washington, a Kansas City Democrat, said she could not support a stadium funding bill if the capital improvements bill is not part of a special session.
“Those things are more important to me and to my colleagues than the Chiefs,” Washington said.
Kehoe did not rule out including the capital spending in a call for a special session, but did not commit to it, either.
“I’ve heard and listened to quite a few senators and representatives from both sides of the aisle on that very same issue, and I understand what their concerns are,” Kehoe said. “And I think it’s fair to say everything is on the table of what that special session might look like.”
Kehoe has a June 30 deadline for acting on the $53 billion in spending that was approved for the coming fiscal year. The budget spends $15.8 billion in general revenue, about $2.2 billion more than estimated revenue for the year, by dipping into the accumulated surplus that stood at $3.6 billion when the current fiscal year began.
Revenues are not keeping up with projections and Missouri House leaders cited a need to maintain a fund balance in excess of $1 billion for future years. Kehoe, who will be responsible for making sure spending does not exceed available funds, said he agrees with that approach.
“I don’t think it’s ever appropriate for some politician to think just because we have it, we have to spend it,” Kehoe said. “ It’s more appropriate for us to leave some reserves in the tank for the times when the budget does get tougher.”
Kehoe, who took office in January, had a successful session. Major items he asked for in his State of the State Address — a state takeover of the St. Louis Police Department, school safety legislation and a major tax cut eliminating income taxes on capital gains — all passed.
Kehoe took some defeats as well, with lawmakers spending more than he wanted on public schools, the failure of a bill reducing the top income tax rate and the defeat of legislation allowing parents to enroll their children in school districts other than the one they live in.
He said he looks favorably on the bill repealing the Proposition A sick leave law but stopped short of promising to sign it. 
Kehoe also did not say whether he would put the constitutional amendment imposing a new ban on abortions on a special election ballot or let it wait for a November 2026 vote.

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)For a second year in a row, New York City and Los Angeles were among the cities with the most population growth last year as the nation’s largest cities continued to recover from devastating pandemic losses.
The U.S. Census Bureau released new July 2024 city population estimates Thursday.
In New York City, a recent city planning report suggested that “two consecutive years of growth suggest that pandemic-era losses were short-lived.” The city is still almost 328,000 short of its 2020 population, however.
Los Angeles returned to the list of top growth cities for the first time since 2016, according to the Census Bureau.


Are you a teacher, nurse or skilled trades worker looking to buy a house or condo in today’s market? We’d like to talk to you about the experience of trying to buy a home with a household income of around $75,000 a year — email Tim Henderson at thenderson@stateline.org.


The largest one-year population increases for mid-2023 to mid-2024 were New York City (87,184), Houston (43,217), Los Angeles (31,276), and the Texas cities of San Antonio (23,945) and Fort Worth (23,442). The same cities were in the top five the previous year, but the growth is a big turnaround from 2021-22, when New York City lost almost 100,000 people and Los Angeles gained only about 2,000.
A new interest in living in big cities could be impacting rents: Zillow reported this week that there now are eight cities, double the number from 2020, where renters need more than a $100,000 annual income to afford typical rent: New York City ($145,000 needed), San Jose, California ($137,000), Boston ($127,000), San Francisco ($124,000), San Diego ($123,000), Los Angeles ($119,000), Miami ($110,000) and Riverside, California ($103,000).
Homes for sale in the fastest-growing city areas also are getting further out of reach for even moderate-income buyers, according to a National Association of Realtors report also released Thursday. The New York City and Los Angeles areas were listed as “moving in the wrong direction” on affordability, “reflecting a growing divide between what homes actually cost and what local families can afford.”
For instance, even a Los Angeles-area family with a $200,000 income can afford less than a third of the homes listed for sale, including condominiums and townhouses, according to the report.
Houston, San Antonio and the Dallas-Fort Worth area were listed among three tiers as “stuck in the middle” of affordability, “showing signs of progress, yet still falling short of offering real affordability to most families.”
For the four years combined after the COVID-19 pandemic started in 2020, both New York City and Los Angeles have not completely recovered population. New York City is down almost 328,000 people and Los Angeles is still short about 21,000 since the 2020 census, but they remain the nation’s two largest cities.
The largest percentage growth since 2020 was in some fast-growing suburbs: Westlake, Florida, near Palm Beach, has grown to 7,664, more than eight times its 2020 population, and Josephine, Texas, near Dallas, has quadrupled in size to 8,807. Medicine Lake, Minnesota, west of Minneapolis, also quadrupled, to 1,343.

Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/16/ct-budget-spending-cap-fiscal-guardrails/,Officials plan to legally exceed CT's spending cap to avert a Medicaid crisis and pave the way for a new two-year budget.,"State officials are poised to legally exceed Connecticut’s spending cap for the first time in nearly two decades to avert a crisis in paying Medicaid bills — and to pave the way for a new two-year budget.
Both Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration and House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, confirmed a tentative understanding to resolve the Medicaid shortfall expected to approach or exceed $300 million this fiscal year.
And while neither discussed exceeding the cap, which keeps overall budget appropriations in line with household income and inflation, officials have largely exhausted other options to circumvent that limit without formally going beyond it.
“The administration continues to make positive progress with legislative leaders on an agreement regarding the deficiency bill for fiscal year 2025 and a framework for the budget for fiscal years 2026 and 2027,” Lamont’s budget spokesman, Chris Collibee, said Friday. “We are optimistic that an agreement can be reached soon.”
“I expect we will vote on Monday” to cover the Medicaid shortfall, Ritter said late Thursday, then quickly added a huge qualifier that hinted toward a compromise.
Exceeding the cap now allows CT to spend more in next two years
The speaker said legislators will cover that Medicaid gap in the traditional manner, which involves formally appropriating the necessary funds. 
With the administration forecasting an almost $2.4 billion surplus this fiscal year, and another $4.1 billion stashed in the rainy day fund, Connecticut can easily cover a $300 million Medicaid shortfall.
A lack of budget resources was never the problem. 
But covering the Medicaid gap and other cost overruns in the current budget would push spending $25.4 million over the cap, based on the last month’s projections.
That can be accomplished, provided the governor declares a budget emergency in writing and that the House and Senate each agree with a 60% vote of approval. The $300 million would be drawn from this year’s projected surplus. 
And if Lamont and lawmakers agree to spend about $300 million more than normally permitted this fiscal year, they get to spend roughly $650 million extra over the next two years combined, based on spending cap growth rules. Democrats are expected to spend that money on municipal aid, human services, education and state employee wages. 
Officials have done so seven times since the spending cap was created in 1991 but not since 2007, when Republican Gov. M. Jodi Rell and a Democratic-controlled legislature appropriated $690 million above the limit to significantly boost municipal aid and payments to doctors and other providers that treat the poor.
But after a severe recession pushed state finances deep into the red and triggered a historic $1.8 billion-plus tax hike in 2011, legally exceeding the cap became politically taboo.
Lamont, who called the spending cap “sacrosanct” in a January meeting with business leaders, has been loath to tamper with this or other budget controls that he often calls “fiscal guardrails.”
Over the last seven years, Connecticut has used budget surpluses to add $3.9 billion to its rainy day fund and shrink pension debt by $8.6 billion.
But many of the governor’s fellow Democrats in the legislature’s majority say these controls, which were last calibrated in 2017, are saving excessively at the expense of local schools, health care and other core services.
These budget caps have captured an average of $1.8 billion from the General Fund each year since 2017, equal to about 8%, and will collect a projected $2.4 billion or 10% this year.
With three-quarters of the General Fund tied to wages, Medicaid, debt service, retirement benefits and other fixed costs, removing 10% from the remaining quarter budget has a big impact.
Critics also say political fears of exceeding the cap have triggered an overreliance on less-than-transparent accounting gimmicks that circumvent spending limits without officially breaking them.
How the various budget plans struggled under the current cap
Since the coronavirus first struck in 2020, Connecticut has used billions of dollars in emergency federal aid — which can be spent outside normal cap limits — to defer cap reform and to bolster programs that otherwise would have been cut. But those resources have nearly all been exhausted, and the impact can be seen in budget proposals for the next two fiscal years.
To keep spending under the cap, budget plans proposed by both Lamont and the Democratic-controlled Appropriations Committee would underfund contractually guaranteed health care for retired state workers by an average of $114 million per year. 
Both also dramatically scaled back a major planned increase in payments to health care providers who treat the poor. 
Budget plans proposed by the governor, the Appropriations Committee and House Republicans each would shift $300 million or more outside of the budget and spending cap system to bolster early childhood development over the coming biennium. The proposal initially came from Lamont, and both parties supported it.
Lamont’s plan would also reduce base education grants to nearly half of Connecticut’s 169 cities and towns next fiscal year.
And the governor would need to borrow $60 million per year to maintain the Town Aid Roads Program, which covers basic road maintenance and winter snow removal, because otherwise his budget would exceed the cap.
Tensions around a proposed workaround
Faced with this year’s Medicaid cost overruns and more cap constraints, House Democrats earlier this week hoped to find one more legal loophole.
They originally planned to shift about $300 million in projected surplus outside of the formal budget — an accounting move possible with a simple majority vote — to meet Connecticut’s obligations to health clinics, social service agencies and other care providers this fiscal year. 
Then, assuming Medicaid demand would not shrink, the Democrats’ plan would restore that extra $300 million to the formal budget in each of the next two fiscal years, effectively claiming a cap exemption on grounds that it was the start of a new program. 
But the Lamont administration balked at what it saw as a transparent and poorly designed gimmick and threatened to delay payments to care providers until after the next fiscal year begins on July 1 on grounds that it didn’t have available funds.
Ritter then countered Thursday by announcing the House would run a bill Monday that would cover the Medicaid shortfall with the off-budget accounting maneuver, effectively forcing Lamont to choose between strict adherence to the spending cap and supporting Connecticut’s care providers.
Both sides quickly thereafter resumed negotiations and struck a compromise, prompted in part by the potential damage to care givers.
Providers responded that — unlike the state of Connecticut — they aren’t flush with cash, can’t wait six to seven weeks for dollars due in late May, and don’t like being used as a political football.
“We will be in serious arrears and not able to make payroll,” Alice Forrester, CEO of Clifford Beers Community Health Partners in New Haven, said shortly before Lamont and legislators struck a tentative deal.
Forrester, whose group employs about 400 people, adding that “things are very tight, and the Medicaid rates are already paying at 62 cents on the dollar. We’re already in the hole.”
Connecticut’s federally qualified health centers, which provider medical, dental and behavioral health care services to about 30% of the Medicaid population, “are already vastly underpaid by Medicaid, which the state’s own study confirmed, and are operating on the slimmest of margins,” said Shawn K. Frick, CEO of the Community Health Center Association of Connecticut.
The prospect of a six-week delay in payments “because of an internal disagreement between policymakers is outrageous and dangerous,” he said, and it could have triggered layoffs, canceled medical appointments and possibly even site closures.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ritterlamont-1024x790.jpg,,,2025-05-16 13:12:27.428326

Kurtis Gregory shakes hands following his introduction to the Missouri Senate (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Missouri Farm Bureau will be allowed to sell health care plans to its members, Medicaid will cover the cost of hearing aids for adults and supplies of birth control will be extended under legislation that passed the legislature in the waning hours of the session on Thursday. 
The legislation, which was sponsored by Republican state Sen. Kurtis Gregory of Marshall, now heads to the governor’s desk.
The underlying bill allows the Missouri Farm Bureau to sell health care plans that don’t abide by the protections set by the Affordable Care Act. As a result, the Farm Bureau would be able to offer lower-price coverage options, which the organization and its supporters say is necessary to help uninsured farmers.
“This is a product that is going to get people coverage that otherwise cannot afford it,” Gregory said at a House hearing last month. “This is a coverage product that is going to save lives. It is a product that’s going to save people money.”
State Rep. Brad Pollitt, a Republican from Sedalia who carried the bill in the House, said Thursday that the Farm Bureau’s health plans “will not be the solution for everyone. But those without health care plans believe this will be beneficial.”
This was the third year the bill has been proposed, and it’s received significant pushback from Democrats and patient advocates, who argue it would leave some Missourians without protections. It’s also faced opposition from insurance companies who argue it gives the Farm Bureau an unfair advantage over competitors.
If the bill is signed into law, Missouri will join 10 states that have adopted similar carveouts for the Farm Bureau in previous years. Alabama and Florida also passed similar measures this year.
Democrats added some protections to the Farm Bureau portion of the bill during negotiations, including mandating the organization to provide a clear disclaimer that the products it’s selling are not officially regulated as health insurance, mandating the company can’t cancel coverage for members because of a medical event and ensuring the state insurance department will handle complaints. 
The bill contains a wide swath of other health measures, including several added by Democrats during negotiations, especially by state Sen. Patty Lewis of Kansas City.
Those include: provisions mandating that Missouri Medicaid cover hearing aids and cochlear implants for adults, expanding access to testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections, requiring insurance companies that provide birth control medication to provide extended supplies and tweaking the law around telehealth to allow audio-only visits. 
There was little opposition voiced on Thursday. 
State Rep. Betsy Fogle, a Democrat from Springfield, said the negotiations “were able to make a bill significantly better with wins for the majority party, wins for the minority party and ultimately wins for our constituents back home.”
The bill passed by a vote of 147 to 1 on Thursday afternoon in the House. That followed a vote of 24 to 6 in the Senate.
 ‘This is a big deal’

The Farm Bureau would offer lower prices by reverting to the pre-Affordable Care Act practice of what’s called medical underwriting — carefully evaluating applicants’ medical history and risk — to determine whether to cover them and at what price. 
The Farm Bureau is a nonprofit agricultural membership organization which partners with for-profit companies to sell various kinds of insurance to its members. Anyone can join — the fee is $30 per year. Historically the group has been primarily made up of people in farming communities.
Gregory has estimated around 15,000 Farm Bureau members lack health insurance and would be the target audience to enroll in the benefit plan.
Many farmers and other members of the Farm Bureau, proponents say, are uninsured because they can’t afford to buy an individual plan on the Affordable Care Act marketplace or make too much money to qualify for subsidies.
Garrett Hawkins, president of Missouri Farm Bureau, said in an interview with The Independent shortly after the bill passed that the organization’s effort has been years in the making. 
Lack of health insurance options for farmers is “an impediment to bringing the kids home to the farm. It’s an impediment to bringing a spouse home to the farm who has pursued off-farm employment solely to get health coverage,” he said. “This is a big deal.”
Emily Kalmer, a lobbyist for the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, said at a House hearing last month that even with concessions made at the urging of the bill’s critics, patient advocates remain highly concerned.
“To be clear, this legislation still allows the Farm Bureau to sell unregulated products that won’t have to comply with many of the other provisions we fought for over the years,” Kalmer said, including protections for preexisting conditions.
 Hearing aids and birth control

Medicaid coverage for hearing aids and cochlear implants for adults would be expanded under the bill passed Thursday. Currently, Medicaid in Missouri, which is called MO HealthNet, only covers hearing aids for eligible children, pregnant women and blind people.
There was little opposition to that change this year, but in prior years there has been some concern around the cost. The Medicaid hearing aid and cochlear implant provisions are estimated to cost up to $10.3 million in fiscal year 2027, and $2.7 million the following year, according to the fiscal note.
“I realize there are some costs to this,” said state Rep. Cameron Parker, a Republican from Campbell. “But I do believe that the benefit of these services, the hearing instruments, the cochlear implants, outweigh the cost greatly.”
The bill also requires health plans to cover extended supplies of birth control. Plans that provide coverage for hormonal contraceptives would be required to cover a supply lasting up to 90 days, or, for generic medication, up to 180 days — meaning patients would be able to pick up months-long supplies of the birth control pill at one time rather than needing to pick up the prescription more frequently. 
The Independent’s Jason Hancock contributed reporting.

(Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Gov. Laura Kelly and leaders of the Kansas Legislature approved the $45,000 settlement of a lawsuit filed by a former employee of the Kansas Department for Children and Families who was fired after requesting expansion of medical leave to care for a relative.
Former DCF employee Shayne Watson filed suit in U.S. District Court alleging the state agency interfered with his rights under the Family and Medical Leave Act and was terminated in retaliation for insisting on altering his leave from intermittent to continuous.
Watson had been granted intermittent leave by DCF to care for a relative with dementia from 2019 to 2022, but was fired within two weeks of requesting his FMLA status be changed to continuous.
Court documents show DCF attorney Marc Altenbernt argued the agency didn’t retaliate against Watson and had immunity from the lawsuit. The record also indicated DCF asserted Watson’s work performance was lackluster and that he deviated from a telework agreement. In addition, documents show DCF claimed Watson was combative during a personnel meeting prior to the firing.
Watson was terminated by the state agency in September 2022. He filed a federal lawsuit seeking in excess of $75,000.
In January, U.S. District Court Judge Holly Teeter granted summary judgment to DCF on Watson’s claim the agency interfered with his family-leave rights, but the judge allowed the retaliation claim to move forward. In February, a trial date was set on the retaliation portion of the complaint.
In April, the case was closed following negotiations on a settlement between attorneys representing DCF and Watson.
The State Finance Council, which includes the governor as well as Republican and Democratic leaders of the House and Senate, voted 7-0 to resolve the case with the $45,000 payment to Watson.
Watson was hired by DCF in 2018 and worked as a career navigator assigned the help adults without dependent children obtain employment while receiving government benefits.
Meanwhile, the State Finance Council voted to reject a proposed settlement in the case of Link v. State of Kansas. Neither details of the lawsuit nor the settlement amount recommended by the Kansas attorney general’s office were revealed by council members during the public portion of this week’s meeting.
When council members emerged from executive session, the governor requested a motion to accept the settlement. None of the council members present said anything until Senate President Ty Masterson of Andover said the silence reflected opposition to the deal.
“I think you’re finding nobody wants to make the motion,” Masterson said.
“Well,” Kelly said, “we could make the motion and vote it down if that is what everybody is feeling.”
Masterson made the motion to consider the settlement and voted for approval along with House Minority Leader Chris Croft, R-Overland Park.

(Photo by Maine Morning Star)With other states tied up in a federal legal battle, Maine lawmakers are opting to pump the brakes on an effort to hold fossil fuel companies accountable to see how those other cases play out.
The Legislature’s Environment and Natural Resources Committee voted Wednesday to carry over one of the two bills that would establish a superfund for large fossil fuel companies to pay for infrastructure repairs, resiliency efforts and other costs in the rural and low-income communities disproportionately affected by flooding and other disasters.
Before the committee voted unanimously to ask the presiding officers to carry the bill into the second regular session that begins in January, Sen. Stacy Brenner (D-Cumberland) quoted a constituent of hers, Bob Monks, who recently died. 
Monks was known for his activism around good corporate governance and multiple U.S. Senate runs. Brenner said his idea that “if you ran an elephant company, you would always clean up after your elephants,” captured the spirit of her bill. 
“We need support to clean up after the elephants,” she added. 
However, Brenner agreed that it makes sense to wait until next year so the state has time to track what happens with the pending federal lawsuits before moving forward. Maine Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Melanie Loyzim made a similar suggestion during the public hearing for LD 1870.
Vermont and New York have already passed similar superfund legislation. However, those states, as well as Hawaii and Michigan, have subsequently been sued for those policies, including by the U.S. Department of Justice. The Justice Department said the lawsuits are also meant to advance an executive order from President Donald Trump that targets state and local policies involving climate change, environmental justice and carbon emissions reductions.
Rep. Mike Soboleski (R-Phillips) said his biggest concern with LD 1870 is the ongoing legal backdrop, so he appreciated the time to gather more information before deciding what to do in Maine. 
Since the committee agreed they only need one legislative vehicle to take up this topic again next year, members rejected the other related bill, LD 1808 from Rep. Grayson Lookner (D-Portland). Instead, they sent a letter to the Department of Environmental Protection asking it to report back to the committee with an update on those lawsuits. 
Lookner suggested having the department look into whether Maine would go after the same companies as the other states and collect other data, such as how much it would cost to implement this sort of measure. 
Loyzim told the committee her department was already planning to track the lawsuits as they unfold.

Yellowstone National Park wildlife staff trapped and euthanized a grizzly bear this week after a series of conflicts with human food sources and trash in the park’s most popular tourist areas.
According to a Wednesday press release from the park, the 11-year-old, male grizzly bear, estimated to weigh 400 pounds, had repeatedly sought out food sources near Old Faithful, the Nez Perce Picnic Area and the Midway Geyser Basin parking lot.
The griz developed a strategy to flip over 800-pound dumpsters, uprooted small bear-resistant trash cans from their concrete bases and “became increasingly food-conditioned,” which wildlife managers decided posed a safety risk in such a busy area fo the park. The decisions to euthanize the animal was made to ensure public safety and reduce the chances of other bears becoming habituated to human food.
“It’s unfortunate that this bear began regularly seeking out garbage and was able to defeat the park’s bear-resistant infrastructure,” Yellowstone Bear Management Biologist Kerry Gunther said in a press release. “We go to great lengths to protect bears and prevent them from becoming conditioned to human food. But occasionally, a bear outsmarts us or overcomes our defenses. When that happens, we sometimes have to remove the bear from the population to protect visitors and property.”

The last grizzly bear killed in a management action in Yellowstone was in the fall of 2017, when park officials removed a griz that was damaging tents and accessing human food in backcountry campsites near Heart lake.
Yellowstone National Park’s bear management plan provides bear-resistant food storage lockers in all campgrounds, food storage devices in all backcountry campsites, and bear-resistant garbage cans and lockers. Park officials remind all visitors that utilizing these bear safety measures remain crucial in ensuring public safety, and preventing wildlife from developing dangerous habits.
All of Yellowstone is bear country, from the trails in the park’s backcountry to the boardwalks and parking lots around Old Faithful. Visitor safety cannot be guaranteed, but visitors can play an active role in protecting themselves and the bears people come here to enjoy.

“I am fortunate to have served Iowa State University in many roles over the past 46 years, and it’s been a fascinating journey,” Wintersteen said. “I am truly proud of Iowa State’s extraordinary faculty and staff for their remarkable performance these past years. Perhaps most of all, I will miss the amazing energy, talent and potential of our Iowa State students.”
“Under President Wintersteen’s leadership, Iowa State’s reputation has soared, particularly in research growth, student outcomes and an emphasis on innovation,” Iowa Board of Regents President Sherry Bates said. “With her steady guidance, Iowa State has met and overcome many external challenges, including a derecho, an international pandemic and more.”
During Wintersteen’s tenure, ISU established new and newly renovated facilities across the campus, and the university expanded its ISU Research Park.
Wintersteen is credited with advancing support for research at Iowa State, which now ranks in the top 3% for research out of nearly 500 universities without a human medical school. Over the past eight years, ISU received more than $4.2 billion in external funding, including three consecutive years of record-setting research funding.
According to the university, ISU’s first-year student retention rate has climbed to 87.6%, which is 10.5 points higher than the national average for four-year public institutions, and ISU students are graduating faster than ever before. The average time to degree has decreased from 4.4 years in 2018 to a historic low of 4.12 years in 2024.
Wintersteen is also credited with fundraising success and for helping to secure more than $275 million for new or revitalized facilities, including the Student Innovation Center and the Therkildsen Industrial Engineering Building. The ISU Research Park also experienced significant growth, with a 150-acre expansion and nearly 50 new tenants.
Wintersteen began her career at Iowa State as an extension field specialist in integrated pest management. After completing her doctorate in entomology, she became a professor and held several leadership roles before being named president in 2017 — including an 11-year stint as the inaugural endowed dean of the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/isu-sign.jpg,,,2025-05-16 12:23:47.174908

Two Florida congressional Democrats have asked federal officials to investigate allegations that the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA) and Hope Florida Foundation inappropriately diverted Medicaid funds to two unrelated political committees last year.
The Hope Florida Foundation is the non-profit affiliated with Hope Florida, the charity started by Florida First Lady Casey DeSantis that aims to connect struggling Floridians with local charities and churches.
  Rep. Darren Soto, via his Facebook page
  Congresswoman Kathy Castor via U.S. House
U.S. Reps. Kathy Castor’s and Darren Soto’s letter to Juliet T. Hodgkins, acting inspector general for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and Dr. Mehmet Oz, administrator for the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services, marked the first time that federally elected officials have called for a federal investigation into the Hope Florida matter.
“The transfer of Medicaid dollars to a charitable committee and then political committees appears to run afoul of federal laws, including 18 U.S.C. 1347 (to knowingly execute or attempt a scheme to defraud a health care benefit program or obtain money from it) and 18 U.S.C. 371 (for two or more people to agree to defraud the United States), and may implicate other relevant statutes and regulations,” Castor and Soto write.
“As members of the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee that provides oversight of Medicaid, we can assure you that Congress is very focused on waste, fraud and abuse of Medicaid dollars. Any unlawful diversion of Medicaid dollars in Florida means that the state is less able to provide services to our neighbors who rely on Medicaid and support the providers who serve them.”
The controversy dominated the second half of the Florida Legislative session this year. It centers around a $10 million “donation” to the Hope Florida Foundation that came from a Medicaid overpayment settlement with the health care giant Centene last September.
A month later, the foundation sent that $10 million to two nonprofit political committees. Those two committees subsequently sent $8.5 million to Keep Florida Clean, a political action committee created to oppose Amendment 3, the ballot measure that would have legalized marijuana.
The revelations regarding the Hope Florida Foundation were first reported by the Tampa Bay Times/Miami Herald. They led to an investigation by the Florida House Health Care Budget Subcommittee that abruptly ended inconclusively three weeks ago. The chairman of that committee, Pensacola Republican Alex Andrade, said that any final charging decisions would be up to the U.S. Department of Justice.
‘Really disheartening’
But there has yet to be a federal response to the controversy.
“Hope Florida had raised only $2 million during its three years of existence but in one fell swoop, received $10 million from a Medicaid settlement which was immediately funneled through other nonprofits to a PAC directed by the Governor’s Chief of Staff,” the lawmakers wrote in a reference to James Uthmeier, subsequently appointed by DeSantis to serve as the state’s attorney general.
The letter adds:
“The Florida House of Representatives initiated an investigation into what State Representative Alex Andrade called a potential ‘conspiracy to commit money laundering and wire fraud’  but ultimately determined that ‘the best avenue is probably a federal investigation because … these were Medicaid dollars.’ The diversion of Medicaid dollars requires immediate investigation.”
During a press conference in Brandon on Wednesday, Casey DeSantis asserted that Hope Florida has become one of the “only meaningful reforms” to the welfare state since President Lyndon Johnson’s “Great Society” programs from the late 1960s.
She said it was “really disheartening and very sad, but not surprising, to see these slanderous false accusations hurled at Hope Florida in an attempt to undermine all of the meaningful progress that we’ve had on so many families across the state of Florida.”

“WanderNebraska,” a project of the Nebraska State Historical Society Foundation, is promoting visits to 213 museums, libraries and notable attractions this year via brochures, billboards, bus tours and prizes for visiting.
The program, now in its fourth year, has grown from an idea spawned over plates of pasta to an effort that has generated 7,000 requests from 18 states this year for WanderNebraska booklets. Initially, it promoted 27 sites.

“We think it’s a neat program,” said Leslie Fattig, executive director of the Historical Society Foundation. “We’re teaching people about Nebraska history and getting more people involved.”
At Chimney Rock National Historic Site, more than 20,000 visitors have traversed the “Walk to the Rock” trail since it opened in the autumn of 2023, tourism increases that Fattig attributes, in part, to WanderNebraska’s marketing.
Similar to ‘Nebraska Passport’
The WanderNebraska program is similar to the “Nebraska Passport” program operated by the Nebraska Tourism Department, which beckons tourists to visit 70 eateries, breweries, wineries, bed and breakfast inns and other commercial attractions.
Both programs beckon people to discover new places and qualify for prizes. But Fattig said that WanderNebraska is more focused on nonprofit attractions that highlight history, and those in small towns with smaller staffs and budgets.
Tourism advocates have long argued that Nebraska — which ranks as one of the least-visited states — spends too little to promote its sites of interest, so the WanderNebraska program is filling a void.
About 35% of all tourism spending is for historical attractions, she said, so it makes sense to give historical sites a boost.
“A lot of these small museums are really challenged,” Fattig said, adding that many lack the funds or staff to market programs or write tourism grants.
So WanderNebraska promotes sites like the log cabin courthouse in Callaway, the Old Poor Farm Historical Site and Animal Sanctuary in Nickerson and the Furnas Prairie Shelter in Brownville. The program also features several county museums and small-town libraries.
“WanderNebraska invites people to connect with the state’s past in fresh, meaningful ways — whether by visiting a small-town museum, discovering a hidden landmark, or exploring a piece of forgotten heritage,” Fattig said.
Prizes and help for smaller places
By visiting 10 sites, a WanderNebraska participant can get a free koozie. By visiting 25 sites, you get a free T-shirt.
The program, funded by donations and grants, also includes training sessions for small museum operators on how to use social media to increase attendance.
In addition, historian Sara Crook, a professor emeritus from Peru State College, leads a series of bus tours to historic sites across the state, such as a “Wild West” tour that includes a stop at Fort Robinson.
Fattig said that the Historical Society Foundation, which had for decades raised money for the State Historical Society, was confronted with a dilemma in 2019. That’s when the then-director of the agency, Trevor Jones, formed a new fund-raising foundation to replace the 83-year-old foundation. Long-established Historical Society fund-raisers were told that their services were no longer needed.
So, Fattig said, the foundation pivoted, and launched a statewide grant program to help sustain and develop mostly small museums across the state. The grant program has grown from $15,000 in the first year to $83,000 this year.
Promoting sites via Wander Nebraska remains an outgrowth of that effort, she said, though the state Historical Society has since restored the foundation’s role as its official fundraiser.
None of the promotional efforts would be possible without donations from supporters of history, Fattig said. For more information about the foundation and WanderNebraska, access the websites www.nshsf.org or wandernebraska.com.

,Mississippi Today,2025-05-16 16:04:07+00:00,Mississippi Today,"This planting season, farmers say federal assistance is too little, too late",Steph Quinn,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/05/16/this-planting-season-farmers-say-federal-assistance-is-too-little-too-late/,Amid falling crop prices and rising input costs – and tariffs – some Mississippi growers say something’s got to give.,"Mike Graves deferred payments to John Deere for the first time in a half century of farming in 2024.
A million dollars for a cotton picker, $800,000 for a combine and $400,000 for a tractor in recent years drove Graves, who grows cotton, soybeans and corn in Tippah County, to borrow money from Mississippi Land Bank, part of the nationwide Farm Credit System, a co-op that provides financial support for farmers.
But this year, as dim predictions for 2025 have farmers questioning whether a few bad years could tip into a crisis, borrowing money isn’t enough.
Graves said he doesn’t like to rely on federal subsidies, but without the $31 billion in emergency payments Congress approved to aid farmers in December, “wouldn’t any of us survive.”
“I hate that the government has to get in it, but I’m not going to turn down anything they offer, either,” Graves said.
Congress in December approved $31 billion in direct payments to help farmers nationwide cope with lackluster crop prices, high input costs and extreme weather. But some Mississippi farmers said the payments they received through the $10 billion Emergency Commodity Assistance Program were smaller and later than they expected. And it’s unclear when and how the remaining $21 billion in disaster assistance will be disbursed.
Rates the USDA announced in March were much less than initial estimates floated for the per-acre commodity payments – $200 for cotton, $100 for corn, $81 for rice and $50 for soybeans – all linked to an unsuccessful bill introduced by Mississippi Republican U.S. Rep. Trent Kelly in October. Instead, farmers are receiving $85 per acre for cotton, $43 for corn, $77 for rice and $30 for soybeans.
While Kelly’s initial bill calculated payments at 60% of farmers’ losses, the version included in the budget bill lawmakers passed on Dec. 21 – the day a government shutdown would have begun had Congress not acted – figured those payments at 26% of those amounts.
Though the law directed the USDA to make the payments within 90 days of its enactment – by March 21 – some Mississippi farmers said they didn’t receive their money until late April. And unlike the commodity payments, the $21 billion for natural disasters has no deadline for the USDA to disburse it. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s website, Mississippi has disbursed $118 million through the Emergency Commodity Assistance Program. The USDA has not announced when or how the $21 billion will be distributed.
Will Maples, an assistant professor of agricultural economics at Mississippi State University Extension Service, said that while the state is “nowhere near” the conditions that led to the notorious farm failures of the 1980s, “the concern is, can we get there?”
“If we stay in this environment,” Maples said, “2025 is looking tough, and 2026 is another tough year. That’s when talk about ‘Can it get as bad as the 80s?’ will really pick up.” 
Maples encouraged farmers to look out for “price rallies” as the growing season progresses, and not to be afraid to sell early.

Still, some farmers say conditions are worse than they’ve seen in years, and that the timing of federal commodity payments – well into planting season – hasn’t helped.
Brian Camp, a Union County soybean farmer, said farmers had hoped to use that money to pay outstanding debts in time to purchase inputs like seed for this year’s planting season.
“What they sent us now, it won’t even pay our fuel,” Camp said.

Lauren Swann, who grows cotton and watermelons in Union County, said drought last summer in northeastern Mississippi made margins even tighter.
“The math just ain’t mathin’,” Swann said.
As farmers face uncertainty about potential impacts of President Donald Trump’s tariffs this growing season, some continue to grapple with the consequences of his first trade war, experts said.
On a podcast with Mississippi Today last week, State Economist Corey Miller said that Trump’s 2018 tariffs eroded markets for U.S. agricultural exports and could do so again. The U.S. lost some $20 billion in agricultural exports in Trump’s first term, Miller told WJTV earlier this year.
Maples said that while Brazil first surpassed the U.S. in 2013 to become the world’s largest exporter of soybeans, Trump’s 2018 tariffs – and China’s retaliation in kind – cemented the South American country’s dominance in the international soybean market. China, the world’s top importer of soybeans, which is Mississippi’s biggest crop by acreage, sources some 70% of its supply from Brazil.
For soybean growers, “a lot of what we’re dealing with now is kind of a holdover from the last 2018 trade war we had with China,” Maples said. 
The U.S. and China announced a tariff truce Monday, with both countries slashing tariffs for the next 90 days as they continue to negotiate.
Farmers described struggling to square Trump’s claims to be on farmers’ side with uncertainty about the potential for tariffs to further cut prices. In a March Truth Social Post, Trump urged farmers to “get ready to start making a lot of agricultural product” for domestic sale and “have fun!”
“We’re being told to go out there and have fun, and be patient,” Swann said. “But planting season doesn’t wait, so we can’t wait on help.”
Graves said he hopes Trump’s tariffs will ultimately lead to higher prices, as long as the measures “get everything straight before everybody goes broke on the farm.” 
“He said he’s going to take care of us,” Graves said. “But we’ll see, I guess.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/16074248/Lauren-Swann-6.jpg,,,2025-05-16 12:23:47.174908

Jefferson Griffin has conceded his loss to Allison Riggs in the North Carolina Supreme Court Race.
This ends one of the most pathetic and embarrassing chapters for any public servant in the history of our state and country. 
Seldom before has one man so thoroughly ruined his reputation in the pursuit of power. We can only hope that his humiliation will deter future wannabee autocrats from going down the same dark path that he chose. 
Because you see, there is nothing more patriotic and small-D democratic than gracefully conceding an election that you lost and willfully participating in the peaceful transfer of power. This is how a strong democracy functions. Indeed, there is no democracy when the loser of a race refuses to concede. I was once a proud member of the Republican party before Donald Trump took complete control of the party. Now sadly the GOP has become the party of election denialism, where candidates are praised for trying to steal an election by any means necessary. It is a damn shame, and they are taking the country down a dark path. 
What Jefferson Griffin has done the last few months is also a disgrace to anyone that has ever worn the military uniform and fought for this country and its ideals. I believe that some of the greatest and most inspirational political speeches in American history have been concession speeches. John McCain in 2008 comes to mind. 
But perhaps the best and most American speech of my lifetime was Vice President Al Gore’s concession speech after the 2000 election. This was one of the closest and most hotly contested elections in American history, and after the Supreme Court made its final decision, Gore gracefully conceded to George W. Bush. He didn’t try and change the rules after the game was played, and he certainly didn’t instigate an insurrection at the Capitol, or act like a manchild because he didn’t get his way. 
Instead, he decided to act like a man with honor and a leader with integrity. He put principles over power and country over party and said the following:

        “I say to President-elect Bush that what remains of partisan rancor must now be put aside, and may God bless his stewardship of this country. Neither he nor I anticipated this long and difficult road. Certainly, neither of us wanted it to happen. Yet it came, and now it has ended, resolved, as it must be resolved, through the honored institutions of our democracy.”    
 
These are the words of a true patriot. It is hard to fathom such words ever coming from such empty and hollow men as Jefferson Griffin and Donald Trump.
Let us also not forget that Griffin could have followed the lead of what former Chief Justice Cheri Beasley did after her defeat in the 2020 state Supreme Court election. She lost by an even slimmer margin of 401 votes compared to the 734 votes that Jefferson Griffin lost by. She asked for audits and recounts which was in her right after such a close election. But after the recounts confirmed her loss, she conceded like a person of character would and went about her life serving the public in other ways. She left with her dignity and her head held high and history will remember fondly for that.
 Jefferson Griffin had that same opportunity but instead chose the path of raw power. He decided to forfeit his dignity and self-respect and now history will remember him as a coward and a fool, if it even remembers him at all. In a world full of Jefferson Griffins, teach your kids to be an Allison Riggs or a Cheri Beasley. 
All of this leads me to my main point, which is that now that Griffin has finally conceded his election loss, he should also resign his Army commission as an officer in the Army National Guard. 
As an Army veteran myself, the thing that enraged me so much about all of this is that he has worn and still wears the uniform of an Army Officer. He knows better. The fact that he would willingly try to throw out the votes of thousands of military absentee ballots just because they came from “blue” districts is unforgiveable. Men and women who wear that uniform are supposed to represent America’s best. The uniform represents duty, integrity, and moral courage. And what Jefferson Griffin has done these last six months has brought great shame and dishonor to the uniform. The right to vote is sacred and if men that swear an oath to the Constitution are willing to break it in pursuit of political power, then you should give up that precious uniform so someone that actually loves this country and what it stands for can take your place.
Jefferson – if you have even a shred of dignity and decency left, then you will call your commanding officer tomorrow and formally resign your commission. Your unit, your state, and your country deserve so much better than you.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/first-amendment-1024x680.jpeg,,,2025-05-16 12:23:47.174908

Technically, kratom is not a drug, but some people use it like one. In many cases, they’re using it to help them get off of drugs, like highly addictive opioids.
But there are other kratom stories, and they don’t have happy endings. 
There are two bills being debated in the Louisiana Legislature – one seeks to ban kratom entirely, and the other would regulate how it’s packaged and sold, keeping it available for people who say it’s changed their lives for the better.

City officials have sued. (Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The city of Leavenworth and CoreCivic will take their fight to court June 9 to determine whether the company can reopen its prison facility as an ICE detention center without going through a permitting process. 
Attorneys for Leavenworth filed suit in March in U.S. District Court against the Nashville-based company, which ran the Leavenworth Detention Center before it was closed in 2021. 
CoreCivic announced its intent to reopen its prison facility as an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center, which would be named the Midwest Regional Reception Center. 
In its initial filing, city attorneys said CoreCivic must apply for and receive a supplemental use permit to reopen and operate the prison. 
“Our facility – which has been in Leavenworth since 1992 – is and always has been properly zoned,” said CoreCivic spokesman Ryan Gustin in an email. “Leavenworth’s city code designates our site as an existing special use and lawful conforming use.”
 
Proper permits?
The city recently passed a resolution that indicated CoreCivic needed permission to open its facility, Gustin said. 
“There’s nothing in Leavenworth’s code that allows for such a resolution to rescind zoning,” he said. 
City officials do not agree. In a 211-page filing with attachments, their attorneys said that, while the lawsuit is about the need for proper permitting, there were other problems too. 
From 1992 to 2021, when CoreCivic operated the detention center, the company “became embroiled in multiple widely publicized scandals resulting from its gross mismanagement of the Facility and the ensuing rampant abuse, violence, and violations of the constitutional rights of its detainees and staff,” the filing said. 
“CoreCivic’s mismanagement directly and indirectly impacted the City in countless ways, including for example, by imposing unexpected maintenance costs on its taxpayers, unreasonably increasing the burden on the City’s police and law enforcement agencies to address violent crime, and even impeding the City’s investigation of sexual assaults and other violent crimes against detainees and staff,” the filing said. 
The city’s lawsuit contends that CoreCivic was already operating the prison when the city enacted its development rules that require a permit, so the business was grandfathered in under the new rules. But by ceasing operations for three years, the filing said, CoreCivic must now apply for the special use permit. 
In fact, CoreCivic applied for a special use permit in February 2025 but about three weeks later withdrew that application, the city’s filing said. 
 
Back and forth
Community activists are speaking about against the idea of CoreCivic operating a prison in Leavenworth.

Former CoreCivic employees regularly speak at city and county meetings about their negative experiences working in the closed detention center, and state organizations including the Kansas ACLU have helped organize press conferences and rallies. Objections include how CoreCivic operates, whether people held at the facility will be released into the community, and general opposition to immigrant detention centers.
Gustin said the company, as of April 30, had received applications from more than 1,100 people who want to work at the site. 
“Despite what politically extreme outsider groups are saying, potential new employees and local business partners are excited to be part of what we’re creating in Leavenworth,” said Misty Mackey, warden of the new facility, in a press release. “We’re looking forward to operating a safe, transparent, accountable facility that will be a positive for this community dedicated to public service.”
Gustin said there has been inaccurate reporting about employees working on a job at the prison to replace the facility’s roof. CoreCivic issued cease-and-desist letters to those who accused the roofing company, Bass Roofing and Restoration, Fort Worth, of hiring workers without the proper permits. 
“Any claims that our company has a contractor working for us at our Leavenworth facility that has undocumented or unauthorized workers doing the work are completely false,” he said. “We have been furnished documentation of the legal status of all workers on the roofing project at our facility from the primary contractor and subcontractor.”
The company has said that it will use local contractors at the facility, and Gustin said CoreCivic did reach out to local vendors.
“Experience in roofing our facilities and experience working on our federally contracted facilities is a factor we evaluate in reviewing bids,” he said. “It’s important to note that the roofing contractor who was selected for this project has handled similar work at another of our federal facilities, which required special clearances for workers.”
Collaborative goals
Although aware of community disagreement about the facility, Gustin said CoreCivic wants to work with Leavenworth city and county officials. 
“In addition to the impact fees we’ve agreed to pay – and the property tax we already pay – we’ve worked to both listen to and be transparent with the community,” he said.
CoreCivic has offered the following impact fees:

One-time impact fee of $1,000,000 to the city of Leavenworth
Annual impact fee of $250,000 to the city of Leavenworth
Additional $150,000 annually to the police department

Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, D-Va., are backing a renewed Senate push calling on President Donald Trump’s administration to take urgent diplomatic action to deliver food and emergency aid to civilians trapped in the war-torn enclave.
The two lawmakers joined 27 of their Senate colleagues in introducing a resolution urging the administration to mobilize all available diplomatic tools to break the Israeli blockade that has prevented lifesaving assistance from reaching Palestinian civilians. 
The measure comes amid reports of a worsening humanitarian disaster, with tens of thousands of children at risk of starvation and thousands already suffering from acute malnutrition.
“Every day that innocent civilians, including children, are going without access to food, clean water, or necessary medical care, the humanitarian crisis in Gaza worsens,” Warner said in a statement. 
Warner said it is the responsibility of Israeli authorities to ensure that emergency food and humanitarian aid can reach Palestinian civilians. He added that as lawmakers continue to press for a full ceasefire and the return of all remaining hostages, “the Trump administration must work to ensure that innocent people are not left to die because of inaction.”
Kaine, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, echoed Warner’s urgency and emphasized the need for international aid organizations to be allowed to operate freely in the region.
He stressed that “the Israeli government must immediately lift any blockades on food and emergency aid and allow credible international organizations to facilitate the swift delivery of lifesaving aid to civilians in Gaza.” 
Kaine also emphasized the need to keep pushing for a ceasefire agreement that would bring hostages home and open the door to increased humanitarian assistance, calling it “the only durable path to a resolution of this crisis.”
Since March 2, the Israeli government has blocked all food and emergency aid —  medicine, infant formula, fuel and other essential supplies — from reaching civilians in Gaza. That same month, the United Nations reported the closure of all 25 World Food Program-supported bakeries in the region due to lack of fuel and wheat. 
The conflict began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led militants launched a surprise attack on Israel, killing approximately 1,200 people and taking over 250 hostages. In response, Israel initiated a large-scale military campaign in Gaza, including air strikes and a ground invasion, with the stated objective of dismantling Hamas and securing the release of hostages. 
Since then, the conflict has resulted in more than 52,000 Palestinian deaths, widespread destruction and the displacement of nearly all of Gaza’s 2.3 million residents. The ongoing blockade and military operations have severely exacerbated the humanitarian crisis in the region.
Emergency food parcels meant to last two weeks have been depleted, and malnutrition is spreading rapidly among children, with an estimated 10,000 already affected since January. “Once you get to that stage, without treatment, you will die,” warned Dr. Margaret Harris, a spokesperson for the UN health agency.
Harris added that the number of children receiving care in Gaza’s partially functioning hospitals is lower than anticipated — likely because many are unable to reach medical facilities at all.
WHO data also shows that one in five children is unable to complete treatment, a consequence of ongoing displacement and the unstable, chaotic conditions on the ground.
The Senate resolution does not impose new policy but aims to intensify diplomatic pressure on both the Israeli government and the Trump administration to take immediate steps to allow aid to flow, and to secure a broader ceasefire agreement.

(Photo provided by the New Mexico Health Care Authority)David Scrase has worked as a geriatrician in New Mexico for nearly 30 years, and served several stints as the secretary of the Health and Human Services Departments. He is on the frontlines when it comes to treating older residents and their caregivers.
“This is a growing, giant issue,” Scrase told Source NM. “I always tell people…I never go into a room where at least 80% of the people aren’t trying to figure out what to do with an older person in their family who’s going through something like this. It might not be their immediate family, but…everyone is on the verge of, or in the middle of, or just past having to make these kinds of decisions about how to provide care.”
Scrase started his practice in Michigan in 1981, relocated in 1998 to New Mexico and, he says, started concentrating on patients 75 and older in 2015. He also works as a clinical professor with the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center.
Source NM spoke with Scrase recently about his concerns over aging health care and caregiving. The following interview has been edited for clarity and concision.
Source NM: What concerns do you have about the state of care for seniors in New Mexico?
David Scrase: New Mexico in the year 2000, we were ranked number 39th in the country in terms of the percent of people we had in our population that were 65 and older. And in 2030, according to some really reliable projections, we’ll rank fourth. 
NM Aging department commits to helping seniors age ‘in place’ and ‘autonomously’ in new draft plan

Seniors, in general, use about three times as many resources as people under 65, and so you’ve got this more than doubling of the senior population combined with three times the use rate. So there’s going to be a dramatic growth of seniors and need for care for seniors. 
There’s also the fact that we have the number one poverty rate among people 65 and older, so we have the highest poverty rate for seniors.  And poverty creates illness and complexity.
In the United States, over 6 million people are living with Alzheimer’s disease.  That’s projected to more than double in the next 15 to 20 years. And over 11 million people are caregiving for dementia patients and they’re providing 15 billion hours of free care. And in addition to having to really grow our healthcare facilities to manage all the growth in the population and their use of resources, we’re going to have an issue with caregivers.
What are you seeing in your own practice?
Typically, we see people with dementia either coming in with their spouse, who probably is about the same age as them, and they’re in their 80s and they’re getting progressively less able to perform normal activities or daily living. So the natural history of Alzheimer’s disease is a gradual decline and, therefore, how much caregiving they need is a gradual increase. As we have more Alzheimer’s disease patients and they have this decline, more burden is placed on the families.  And so it’s extremely rare for me to see someone in their 80s not get completely worn out if they’re the sole caregiver for a spouse or partner. 
The most common group of people outside the home that become caregivers are, of course, daughters, which is about 50%, and then followed by daughters-in-law, which is estimated to be 40 to 45%, and so then the men get involved, unfortunately in the last 5 to 10%. And these caregivers, they’re quitting their jobs. If they’re from a big family, they set up some sort of elaborate rotation, but it’s really, really hard to provide care at home for people who may be at the nursing home-level of care needed.  
That is an economic consequence to their family, to the country, et cetera, et cetera, because Medicare doesn’t pay a daughter to take care of her dad. They don’t provide any help when Dad moves in with the family. 
As a geriatrician, I’ll have residents rotate with me, and I’ll always say at the beginning of the session, because half of my patients maybe have dementia, I’ll say, ‘I want you to pay attention to, one, how advanced this patient’s dementia is and, two, how much time do I spend talking to the patient versus how much time I spend talking to the caregiver.’ And as people’s dementia advances, I spend a lot more time making sure the caregiver’s OK, that they have strategies to take care of themselves, that they can cope, because Alzheimer’s disease, we don’t have a lot of great treatments that really improve it.  And if the caregiver collapses, then the whole system collapses. And so typically, the worse the dementia, the more time I spend with the caregivers. 
What concerns have you heard from other New Mexico practitioners?
People are living longer and older people are becoming increasingly complex. I’ve seen a huge change from 1990.  And so it’s harder for some primary care doctors to manage the growing complexity of an 80-year-old’s medical problems. If someone raises the question and someone has a memory issue, that’s like a half hour of time that you have to figure out how to squeeze into a 20- or 30-minute appointment. And often it doesn’t come up until halfway through and so doctors are scheduling people to come back for those assessments. But we’re going to see more and more of it. 
What advice do you give to family caregivers?
The number one thing is you need to take care of yourself first. And it’s like you have this bucket of what you can scoop out every day of help to give to your loved one.  And if your bucket’s not full, it’s not a long-term strategy. That’s probably the biggest issue is getting people to accept the fact that to be an effective caregiver, the first thing they need to do is take care of themselves.
We have these things called the Six Activities of Daily Living: bathing, dressing, feeding, moving around, transferring, continence and going to the bathroom, and when people need help with two of those six, they qualify at the basic level for nursing home care, and there’s families who’re trying to provide three, four, five, sometimes six things at home.  And so if it’s clear that the family members are just not able to survive this, then I’ll recommend that they improve the quality of time they spend with their loved one by putting them in a place where trained professionals can provide all this day-to-day medical care and support care and they can go and have quality time with their relative. 
And then there’s a middle one where they’re not as bad as they need to be in a nursing home, but it’s clear that we’re on this downhill course. And I’ll say, ‘you need to have a plan B. I suggest you go out and look at some assisted living places or some graduated level of care places where you could be in assisted living and then go to a memory care unit maybe and then a nursing home.’
Most people focus on the question of whether or not they want to go to a nursing home, yes or no. And I don’t think that—particularly as people get sicker and sicker— is a helpful question to ask. I think the question is, ‘Do I want to go to a nursing home and accept the pros and cons of that choice, or do I want to keep mom at home and accept the pros and cons of that choice?’ Because there are consequences whichever decision, and that’s why I think I try to work with families to say, ‘hey, this isn’t something you need to decide to feel guilty about. You could really focus on the quality of the time you’re spending with your loved one.’

(Photo courtesy of USDA)A study by the University of Southern California estimates hundreds of thousands of pounds of toxic metals have been dumped onto forests during aerial fire retardant drops during the past decade potentially causing harm to wildlife, specifically endangered and threatened species, according to new federal lawsuit filed against the U.S. Forest Service.
The bright red fire retardant, often seen on television being dumped from large air tankers, contains cadmium, selenium, chromium, and other metals, according to the lawsuit, which was filed by the Forest Service Employees for Environmental Ethics on May 7. The organization is a non-profit made up of current and former USFS employees dedicated to protecting the country’s forests and reform within the agency.
“This stuff is astonishingly dirty,” said Andy Stahl, the executive director of the organization. “Why the hell are we using such a dirty retardant?”

The chemicals found in some retardants can also be fatal to aquatic life and high concentrations of the metals can be toxic to humans, too. The lawsuit focuses on protections for wildlife, alleging the federal agencies are violating the Endangered Species Act.
“At the risk of doing the regulatory agencies job for them, Plaintiff points out the obvious – toxic metals in aerial retardant are bad for many Threatened and Endangered species,” the lawsuit reads.
The National Marine Fisheries Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service are also defendants in the lawsuit. The U.S. Forest Service did not respond to a request for comment.
The plaintiffs are seek acknowledgement and disclosure of the toxic metals being used, as well as biological opinions from other agencies assessing the impact of the fire retardant on threatened and endangered animals.
The USC Study, which is referenced in the lawsuit, was published in 2024 after researchers bought fire retardant and put it in a mass spectrophotometer to determine the chemical make-up of the retardant.
“Based on information and belief, the Forest Service has known about the presence of some, or all, of these metals in aerial fire retardant since well before the publication of the USC study,” the lawsuit reads.
The study estimated that between 2009 and 2021, about 840,000 pounds of toxic metals were added into the environment due to fire retardant drops in the United States.
Companies only had to disclose part of their retardant formula, according to the study, necessitating the mass spectrometry test. Previous concerns around retardants mostly centered on it containing ammonium polyphosphates, which can kill wildlife.
“They’re the ones who have really blown open this issue that retardant, the Phos-Chek retardant, contains astonishingly high levels of heavy metals like cadmium,” Stahl said. “We’ve suspected that for years.”
 ‘Most expensive, least effective’

The organization filed the suit in Missoula in part due to its long association with wildland firefighting.
The United States Department of Agriculture has a Technology and Development Center in Missoula, which includes a lab where fire retardants are tested and certified. Missoula has been at the center of aerial firefighting since the 1940s.
“Missoula tends to be a focal point with fire retardant,” said Jack Cohen, a retired U.S. Forest Service fire research scientist with decades of fire experience.
He also worked at the Missoula Technology and Development Center and doesn’t think fire retardant’s work.
“It’s just about the most expensive, least effective mechanism of fire suppression,” Cohen said.
Drops can be impacted by winds, which can also ground aircraft in the first place. Embers can also move over retardant lines and in a famous example, jumped over a six-lane interstate near Santa Rosa during a 2017 fire.
Direct attack on a fire, or when firefighters’ objective is to contain the blaze as quickly as possible, is also a combination of people, machines and tools. rarely, if ever, is only one method used to work a wildfire.

Cohen said multiple studies into whether retardant drops have any impact on the perimeter of fires have shown inconclusive results as to whether or not they work.
The assumption that retardant drops are effective is a dangerous notion, especially in legal arguments, Cohen said. In a previous lawsuit filed by the ethics group, a Missoula judge ruled that fire retardant does pollute water, but allowed agencies to continue the practice.
“The judge admitted that that was happening and essentially decided against withholding the use of the retardant based on the statement, something on the order of it is conceivable that greater harm to the environment, people and their property would occur without using fire retardant and that assumes that fire retardant is effective” Cohen said. “And to me, that’s very troubling.”
For Stahl, the drops are often about optics and he went on to say the vast majority of aerial retardant drops are ineffective. They are also only used on about 5% of fires, he added.
“Some of the Missoula Fire Science researchers have said to me, quietly, we would accomplish the same damn thing if we just put red food coloring into water and dumped it out of airplanes,” Stahl said. “It would look good on CNN. It wouldn’t be bad for the environment, and it would be just as effective in fire suppression.”
 ‘The cowboy coming over the ridge’

Fighting fires is expected to get more expensive across the country as the climate turns drier and hotter.
Forestry practices in the United States have also focused on suppression, necessitating the armies of firefighters and equipment fire agencies utilize each year. According to the National Interagency Fire Center, the five-year average for suppression efforts in the U.S. is about $3 billion annually.
Prescribed fires, or fires set with the purpose of clearing out fuels or other land management goals, are sometimes used as a tool by fire agencies.
Decades of suppression have left many forests overgrown and full of dead wood, generally regarded in the firefighting world as “fuel” that can make fires more intense.
Prescribed burns seek to take some of that intensity out of wildfires by removing fuels ahead of time.
But there’s a problem there too, Cohen said — the scale of prescribed burns is not nearly enough.
“Prescribed burning is pointless the way we’re doing it now,” Cohen said.

Stahl brought up the example of recent wildfires in Minnesota. Prior to European colonization, the area was an oak savannah that did not have dense forest.
“We’ve committed all the great plains to croplands and have suppressed fire, we now have forests and these in Minnesota and similar northern tier states that used to be savanna, oak grasslands, and those forests when the humidity is low and the wind is high, which, by the way, means the airplanes that dump either water or retardant can’t fly. We get these fires, and they got lots to burn, a lot of biomass to burn.”
To address the issue, Cohen said the focus should be on building and planning. He views community wildfire risk as a structure ignition problem – the way we build makes structures too easily burned. He said if more fire resistant buildings are constructed with fire resistance in mind, fire crews can have a better plan to fight fires and fewer structures will be lost.
No community can fully be fireproofed, Cohen said, but that doesn’t mean it hurts to try. The more buildings that are protected, the less limited fire resources are stretched.
“We can reduce the number of ignitions that do occur and can be matched by our fire protection,” Cohen said.
Communities across the country are updating their fire readiness and Montana Sen. Tim Sheehy has made a point of introducing legislation on the topic, including some for aerial response to fires.
The problem for some, though, is whether aerial bombardment is the most effective strategy for fighting wildfires. And whether the cost, both financially and on the environment, is worth it.
“We do it because it looks good on CNN. It’s the cowboy coming over the ridge,” Stahl said. “Everybody’s real excited. And they see the retardant bomber arrive and the red stuff come out of the plane. They think, ‘Oh, my God, we’re saved.’ Yeah, not so much.”

(Photo by Getty Images, logo courtesy the State of Iowa)A southern Iowa school teacher who lost her job after giving a female student a condom for the girl’s protection has been denied unemployment benefits.
According to state records, Cheyenne Wilson was hired as a high school science teacher by the Clarke Community School District in August 2024. According to testimony given at a state hearing in March, four girls were in Wilson’s classroom on Nov. 14, 2024, for an after-school study session. The students were seated approximately 4 feet away from Wilson while discussing a text conversation one of the students was having with a boy.
One of the students asked Wilson is she knew the definition of an acronym used to describe a particular sex act, and Wilson responded that she did, after which the student stated her own definition of the term.
The conversation then shifted to another sex act, with one student indicating she was nervous about performing the act and using her teeth. Wilson allegedly responded, “Don’t use your teeth, then.”
When it became clear to Wilson that the student was planning to have sex with a boy, she gave the student a condom from her desk for the girl’s protection. Four days later, a complaint was filed with the school district and the principal, Joe Blazevich, began an investigation, with Wilson placed on administrative leave.
The district later sent a letter to Wilson, saying her behavior had called into question her fitness for duty and her ability to serve as an effective role model for students and employees of the district. The letter went on to state that Wilson was not to speak to students and staff or be on school district premises or attend any district activities during the investigation.
On Nov. 20, 2024, Blazevich and Superintendent Kurt DeVore held a meeting with Wilson, during which she allegedly confirmed what had transpired during the Nov. 14 incident.  DeVore told Wilson she had the option to resign and that if she refused there would be an additional “district level” investigation of her conduct. Wilson opted to resign.
Wilson was initially awarded unemployment benefits after a fact-finding interview, but the school district appealed that decision, leading to a March 28 hearing before Administrative Law Judge Emily Drenkow Carr.
At the hearing, Blazevich testified that Wilson should have redirected the students’ conversation to a more appropriate subject matter and noted that Wilson was not a sex educator and was not tasked with addressing such issues with students.
In finding that Wilson was not entitled to unemployment benefits, Carr stated the evidence indicated Wilson’s resignation was not forced and that she was given the option of remaining employed while undergoing a district-level investigation that might involve the school board.
“While Ms. Wilson’s decision to resign may have been for good personal reasons, it was not with good cause attributable to the employer,” Carr ruled.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/IWD-UNEMPLOYMENT-ART.jpg,,,2025-05-16 12:23:47.174908

The measure doesn’t represent a significant cost savings for consumers. It would only shave about 38 cents off a $9 box of tampons.
But advocates raising awareness about the financial burden some people face with every menstrual cycle — and the resulting health consequences — argue that doing away with the state “tampon tax” does have symbolic importance.
“It’s not going to cost (the state) that much,” said Emily Swanigan, a spokeswoman for Period, an education and advocacy group, “but it’s going to demonstrate that women’s health is a priority.”
Missouri Republicans included the tax break on period supplies, along with diapers and incontinence products, in a bill passed May 7 that also eliminates the state’s capital gains tax. In a statement, Republican House Speaker Jon Patterson of Lee’s Summit called the bill “family first legislation.” Gov. Mike Kehoe is expected to sign it.
“Cutting taxes on diapers and feminine hygiene products affects ALL Missouri families,” the statement said, “and will have the greatest positive impact with low-income women and girls across Missouri.”
Democrats, too, have supported cutting taxes on necessities like period products and diapers. They did not support this bill because of the capital gains tax provision, which they argued will largely benefit wealthy Missourians and leave the state in fiscal peril.
But getting rid of the tax on period products and diapers is the right thing to do, said Rep. Jo Doll, a St. Louis County Democrat, who for five years has introduced legislation to remove the tax on menstrual products and diapers.
“The concept that we’re taxing basic necessities as luxury items just seems absurd,” she said.
“I’m sure if you talk to anyone who uses diapers or period products, they can tell you they are not a luxury.”
 Growing awareness

Missouri is one of 20 states that still charge sales tax on period products.
Period, Swanigan’s organization, estimates that Kansas collects just over $3 million annually on taxes assessed on period product sales, while Missouri brings in close to $8 million, a sliver of the state’s $53 billion budget.
Kansas lawmakers have also considered legislation to do away with that state’s tax on period products, but so far that effort has failed.
Still, advocates said, the fact that red states like Missouri and Kansas are considering the issue at all is evidence of growing awareness about “period poverty,” the lack of access to affordable menstrual products. Alabama also recently passed a bill to eliminate its state tampon tax.
Experts said the COVID pandemic may have helped fuel awareness. Supply chain issues and lack of access to products at schools and other public places during the pandemic made the problem even more pronounced and harder to ignore.
Awareness helps in finding a solution to a problem that in past generations was rarely discussed, especially in public, Swanigan said. People are starting to see period products as an essential need, like medicine or food, she said.
“Even within the last two to five years, we’ve seen an increase in understanding about this issue,” Swanigan said. “That’s good news for future policy changes that could help more people.”
In addition to calling for an end to all sales taxes on these products — counties and cities tax them, too — Period wants to see government programs like Medicaid cover them. Food assistance programs like SNAP and WIC do not.
 Consequences

A 2023 survey commissioned by Period and Thinx Inc. found that a quarter of teens and one-third of adults struggled to pay for period products, which have been soaring in price. According to reporting by the Wall Street Journal, the price of tampons went up 36% between 2019 and 2024, while the cost of sanitary pads rose 41%.
It’s a major financial strain for many families, said Jeanette Higgins, a nurse practitioner at Children’s Mercy Hospital.
“Especially for low socioeconomic households,” Higgins said, “they may be forced to choose between buying a menstrual product or buying food.”
The rising cost of menstrual products may be part of the reason Giving the Basics, a Kansas City-area nonprofit that provides pads, tampons and other hygiene supplies to shelters, food pantries and schools, has seen a sharp jump in demand for them.
In 2024, the organization distributed 750,000 period products around Kansas, Missouri and 18 other states. That was a 56% jump from the previous year, said Ashley Allison, the organization’s marketing coordinator.
“It’s one of our most requested products for sure,” she said. “It’s a huge need.”
Other Kansas City organizations, including Giving Hope & Help Inc.  and Strawberry Week, also work on raising awareness and making supplies available to people in need.
When people can’t afford proper supplies to manage their periods they often miss work, which has economic consequences. Kids also miss school and school-related activities. That not only can cause them to fall behind in their classes, it can lead to depression and anxiety, Higgins said.
“Fearing that when they have their period, are they going to have a product?” Higgins said. “Are they going to have to miss an activity or have to miss school?”
Giving the Basics donates period products to 1,028 schools in Missouri and Kansas, including the Independence School District. Lori Halsey, that district’s director of health services, said she wants every student to know they are welcome to take as much as they need for themselves and their family. In addition to donations from Giving the Basics, Halsey said the district relies on grants and funding from the state education department to meet the need.
“It is a struggle for girls to not have that resource,” Halsey said.
There are also health consequences. The 2023 survey from Period found that 40% of teens and more than half of adults have worn period products longer than recommended.
Higgins said using a pad or tampon too long can lead to infections or serious illness. Improvising with supplies not intended for that use can also cause infections, she said.
 Ending stigma

While more schools provide free products to students, asking for them can be intimidating, especially for teens. Stigma is another major hurdle in the fight to end period poverty.
“Girls, especially young girls, have a lot of trouble just even talking about periods,” Higgins said. “Having to go to the nurse to discuss their period cannot be comfortable to begin with, and then they have to discuss why they don’t have products available to them.”
That’s why period products should be free and widely available, said Jessica McClellan, founder and president of Giving Hope & Help, a Kansas City organization that donates pads, tampons and other care items to people in need.
Just as people can find free toilet paper in virtually any public restrooms, she said, people should also find free menstrual supplies. And the world should stop being afraid to talk about periods.
“There’s power in the period,” McClellan said, as she walked around her organization’s Midtown storage room, stocked floor to ceiling with pads, tampons and other hygiene products destined for schools, domestic violence shelters and, sometimes, communities on the other side of the world.
“This is not a woman’s health problem,” she said. “This is a world health care problem that we can easily solve. And it’s a world health care problem that’s right here in Kansas City.”

(Ciattarelli photo by Amanda Burns/Spadea photo by Hal Brown)Bill Spadea, the Republican former radio host running to become New Jersey’s next governor, said learning that he would not be getting President Donald Trump’s endorsement was like a punch to the gut.
Spadea was walking into a campaign event Monday night when he received a phone call from Bill Stepien, who ran Trump’s 2020 reelection campaign, telling him Trump would be endorsing Spadea’s chief rival in the GOP primary, Jack Ciattarelli.
Spadea said he hadn’t seen that coming. But, he said, by the next morning, he woke up to hundreds of texts of support, dozens of new volunteers signed up, and a flood of new, low-dollar donations.
“It exposed this incredible groundswell, thousands of people reaching out. I don’t know that I would have heard from all those people if they didn’t feel the need to say, ‘Wait a minute. This is ridiculous — you’re the Trump guy.’ So I’m very pleased about that,” Spadea said Thursday following a lunch event with the Women’s Republican Club Mantoloking-Bay Head.
Spadea and Ciattarelli, a former state assemblyman who has twice before sought the governor’s seat, have spent months dueling for the support of Trump and the president’s supporters. Trump on Monday posted his endorsement of Ciattarelli on social media, calling Ciattarelli “a terrific America First candidate.” Ciattarelli called himself “truly humbled and honored” to receive Trump’s endorsement.
Speaking to voters at Charlie’s of Bay Head Thursday, Spadea compared Trump’s endorsement of Ciattarelli to a priest at a funeral giving remarks for someone they didn’t know. He said Trump endorsed “a poll, not a person.”
Several polls have shown for much of the race that Ciattarelli is the clear front-runner in the five-man GOP primary. An Emerson College Polling/PIX11/The Hill poll released Thursday puts Ciattarelli at 44% and Spadea in second place at 18%. The poll says 23% of respondents were undecided.
“The guys around the president want it easy. They’re like, ‘Oh, Mr. President, look at this, he’s 20 points down. He can’t win,’” Spadea said. “Really? Because I remember 2016, when Hillary Clinton had a 98% chance of becoming the president.”

Asked to comment, Ciattarelli campaign strategist Chris Russell called Spadea’s remarks “just more BS.”
“The fact of the matter is that Spadea is losing this race by a landslide because of his harsh attacks on President Trump and his lying smears against Jack Ciattarelli. If Spadea thinks it’s a good idea to double down on that failed strategy, more power to him. Jack is focused on uniting the party and working with President Trump to fix our state,” Russell said.
Ciattarelli was the Republican nominee for governor in 2021, losing to Gov. Phil Murphy in a close race.
Less than four weeks remain until June 10, when voters will decide who wins the Democratic and Republican nominations for governor in the fall. Murphy, a Democrat, will leave office in January and is barred from seeking a third consecutive term. In addition to the five-man GOP race to succeed him, six Democrats are vying for their party’s nomination.
While Spadea said Thursday he’s disappointed he wasn’t endorsed by Trump, he believes it’ll hurt Ciattarelli in the long run. He cited candidates with Trump’s endorsement who lost their elections, including Christine Serrano Glassner in last year’s U.S. Senate primary in New Jersey.
Candidates need to have a “certain character, strength, principles in order to capitalize on making that endorsement something,” Spadea said.
“Our plan aligns with his plan, so it would have been a real match,” he said. “So, it would’ve helped me. It’s not going to help Jack the way he thinks.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-16 15:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,How many children are homeschooled in Connecticut?,Angela Eichhorst and Renata Daou,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/16/homeschooling-numbers-in-ct/,"Fewer children are exiting CT public school systems for homeschooling than during the early years of the pandemic, recent data show.","Fewer children are exiting the public school system for homeschooling than during the early years of the pandemic, although the state of Connecticut doesn’t know exactly how many children were never enrolled at all.
While the state of Connecticut suggests “that homeschooling parents complete the Intent to Homeschool form for each child annually and submit it to the Superintendent’s office for signature”, the form is not mandatory. 
In the past three school years, the rate of children exiting the public school system to homeschooling has been less than 0.5% annually of all students in Connecticut public schools, according to a recent report by the Connecticut Department of Education. About 22% of these had been identified for special education prior to their exit, according to the report. 
The rate of children transferring to homeschooling has had a small decline, from 0.4% in the 2021-2022 school year to 0.3% in school years 2022-2023 and 2023-2024. According to the 2025 report, 1,857 children were homeschooled across the state of Connecticut in the 2023-2024 school year.
The numbers of children who transferred to homeschooling do not include children who were never enrolled in public schools.
The optional “Intent to Homeschool” form is sent to school districts. Some parents notify their district that they are continuing homeschooling from the previous year, or that they have children who were never enrolled in school in the first place. For example, the Connecticut Department of Education reported that in Bridgeport, 56 children exited from public schools in the 2023-2024 school year. Bridgeport Public Schools told the CT Mirror they knew of 90 children who were homeschooled that year, which includes children whose parents submitted the Intent to Homeschool form.
The CT mirror contacted 10 of the state’s biggest school districts as well as some in the Greater Hartford area. Of the districts that provided five years’ worth of data, three reported slight decreases in the number of homeschooled children in 2024-2025 compared to 2020-2021, while two reported that homeschooling remained steady. Their data include children who may have unenrolled and reenrolled.
School districts do not have a way of accounting for children who were never in the system. 
“There may be more students who live in the Norwalk community who are homeschooled, but we cannot track them unless they entered our district at some point,” according to an email from Norwalk Public Schools. 
According to the 2024 Household Pulse Survey data, a U.S. Census survey conducted across nine two-week cycles in 2024, the actual number of homeschoolers may be higher. The survey estimated that 3% of Connecticut adults living with K-12 children who reported their school enrollment type are homeschooling. There were also many adults surveyed who did not report their children’s enrollment type.
According to the Household Pulse Survey’s 2023-2024 data, 6% of children nationally are homeschooled. Connecticut is one of 30 states that does not collect or report homeschool participation data.
According to the CT Homeschool Network, “CHN has grown over the decades to around 25,000 CT families,” but this number also includes families who are not currently homeschooling their children. 
Last week, dozens of homeschool parents rallied at the capitol to protest possible homeschool regulations even though no bill was introduced on the topic.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-15-at-3.26.35 PM-1024x553.png,,,2025-05-16 11:10:49.504041

(Jim Neuger/Maine Morning Star)With roughly a month left of the legislative session, some big ticket bills are starting to be set aside until next year. Requests for bills that committees hope to carry over to the 2026 session are supposed to be due to the presiding officers on Friday.
Meanwhile, the Maine Senate and House of Representatives have been busy with marathon voting sessions.
To start, lawmakers this week backed a bill (LD 702) that would officially designate Jan. 6 as a Day to Remember, which if the governor allows the bill to become law will require an annual proclamation “honoring the resilience of democracy during the events of January 6, 2021 in Washington, D.C.,” and encouraging education and civic organizations to observe the day with discussions and events. Before passing the House 74-65, the legislation prompted passionate debate over whether the designation is an important record of the U.S. Capitol riot or if it would be divisive. The Senate voted 20-14 in support.
Other votes of note: 
Following the House vote last week, senators voted 20-12 to reject a bill (LD 187) that would prohibit public sector labor unions from imposing mandatory service fees on nonmembers, otherwise known as a “right to work bill.” 
A labor bill that did pass the Legislature this week is LD 54, which requires employers to disclose pay ranges and maintain records of employees’ pay histories.
Both chambers backed legislation (LD 407) directing the Midcoast Regional Redevelopment Authority, which operates the former Brunswick Naval Air Station, to take steps to purge the property of firefighting foam containing per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, by Dec. 31, 2026. (More on that here and here).
Following passage in the House, the Senate voted 17-15 to back legislation (LD 328), “An Act Requiring the State to Pay a Retired State Employee’s or Retired Teacher’s Premium for Medicare Part B Under Medicare Advantage.” Sen. Mike Tipping (D-Penobscot), who co-chairs the Labor Committee, said the measure is in part a response to the cut and capping of cost-of-living adjustments for retired teachers and other state employees.
Legislation (LD 792) to provide one-time funding to support a research project to evaluate the impact of access for cancer patients to specific dietary services died in what is called non-concurrence after both chambers could not agree on whether to pass or reject the bill (the House was against, Senate for). 
The Senate voted 20-13 and the House 75-64 to back a bill (LD 700) that requires the University of Maine System to waive tuition and fees for eligible full-time students to make up the difference between costs and federal Pell Grants and other financial aid.
Legislation (LD 14) to provide any member of a federally recognized Indian nation, tribe or band in Maine is not required to pay a fee for admission to any state-owned park, historic site, camping area or beach managed by the State passed the Senate unanimously before passing the House 121-18.
Rebuffing the majority of the financial services committee’s opposition, the Senate voted 21-13 and the House 73-69 in favor of an amended version of LD 163, which requires insurance coverage for federally approved nonprescription oral contraceptives and nonprescription emergency contraceptives.
The House and Senate unanimously backed a resolve (LD 270) to establish legislative review of proposed changes to Chapter 850: Health Plan Accountability, a major substantive rule of the Department of Professional and Financial Regulation, Bureau of Insurance. During the House discussion, Rep. Sally Cluchey (D-Bowdoinham) pointed to a portion of the rule that would ensure the name and title of an individual reviewing health insurance claims would not be disclosed publicly, which she said was brought forth after the murder of the UnitedHealth CEO.
Both chambers supported legislation (LD 281) to provide ongoing funds to the Maine Discovery Museum to support the Maine Science Festival, the Maine Invention Convention and the Science Around ME program. 
The chambers are at odds over legislation (LD 828) that would allow chiropractors to be designated as school health advisors. After being rejected by the House by a 77-63 vote, senators accepted an amended version of the bill that specifies that chiropractors can provide physical examinations of students.
The House and Senate are also split over a bill (LD 1013) that would require voter approval if a municipality is seeking to issue a $10 million or more bond. The Senate voted 18-16 in favor of the bill while the House rejected the measure by a vote of 74-68.
And the chambers are at odds over LD 421, “An Act to Eliminate Barriers to Reentry into the Community After Incarceration by Repealing Certain Driver’s License Suspension Provisions.” After the House killed the bill under the hammer, Sen. Pinney Beebe-Center (D-Knox) asked the Senate to take up the minority report in support of the bill, which it backed 19-15. Supporters said the provision would help formerly incarcerated people rejoin society in productive ways, which would be less likely to lead to recidivism. 
The chambers both rejected bills that would prohibit geoengineering (LD 825); direct the Public Utilities Commission to take steps to reduce the use of natural gas through energy contracts (LD 1251); and a bill that would require municipal approval before the state places noncitizens in a municipality (LD 422), among others.
The House and Senate also voted against labor bills that would roll back several child labor protections regarding the number of hours 16- and 17-year-olds can work (LD 644) and extend the hours minors under 16 years old can work (LD 618). More on those here.
Both chambers also rejected a bill (LD 918) that would allow a qualifying religious organization to self-insure for automobile insurance. Sponsor Rep. Steven Foster (R-Dexter) said the bill is meant to help Maine’s Mennonite community, explaining that they don’t believe in relying on others, which he said extends to insurance coverage. However, critics said it would leave those on the other side of an automobile accident with fewer protections.
Some of the other bills that passed both chambers under the hammer:

Senate action
Following similar action in the House last week, the Senate voted 21-12 to advance an emergency measure (LD 1948) that would make the funding in the two-year budget for MaineCare available more immediately (more on that here). The body first voted 21-12 to suspend the rules to bypass the committee process. For an emergency provision to pass, it will ultimately require support of two-thirds of both chambers, which is unlikely given Republican opposition. During debate, Sen. Peggy Rotundo (D-Lewiston) said MaineCare providers across the state “are in crisis because of delayed promised payments…The tragic part of this is we have the funds to make these payments. We need the votes to get the funding out.”
Senators rejected a committee recommendation and backed legislation (LD 125) to raise the maximum annual amount of tax credits the Finance Authority of Maine may issue to investors under the Maine Seed Capital Tax Credit Program from $5 million to $10 million. 
The Senate unanimously backed an emergency bill (LD 1139) to provide ongoing funding of $6 million a year for crime victim services, citing the likelihood that related federal grants may soon be cut. (More on that here).
Senators voted 19-15 to back the committee recommendation against a bill (LD 16) that would establish separate prosecutorial districts in Downeast Maine. While supporters cited the distance that people in that part of the state have to travel, judicial committee chair Sen. Anne Carney (D-Cumberland) said they spent a lot of time working on the proposal but ultimately decided that long term operational and fiscal consequences were too concerning to move forward. 
Senators backed a provision (LD 771) that amends the Maine Criminal Code to define “amphetamine” and “methamphetamine” to mean any compound, mixture or preparation containing any quantity of those substances. Supporters said the change addresses a gap in drug laws but Sen. Chip Curry (D-Waldo) argued the bill would lower the standard for what it means to be a trafficker because it’s common for people to cut drugs with other substances.
Some of the other bills that passed the Senate under the hammer, without a roll call: 

LD 375 “An Act to Require the University of Maine School of Law to Provide an Online Degree Program”
LD 504 “An Act to Improve Family Court Procedure”
LD 1456 “An Act to Expand the Number of On-premises Retail Liquor Licenses a Liquor Manufacturer May Be Issued”

House action
Members of the House voted 79-62 to reject legislation (LD 542) that would establish municipal property tax levy limits, restoring provisions of a law that was repealed in 2023.
The House voted 75-67 to reject a resolution (LD 492) proposing an amendment to the state constitution to provide for “parental rights.” (More on this here).
Members of the House voted 75-66 to reject LD 451, which would require operators of wind or solar developments to test for PFAS and, if so, determine if contamination was “reasonably caused” by the development.
The House also rejected a bill (LD 878) to study the effects of 5G on wildlife populations and children. During discussion, bill sponsor Rep. Tracy Quint (R-Hodgdon) said she’s “trying to find answers for constituents.” But chair Rep. Melanie Sachs (D-Freeport) said the energy committee saw hundreds of studies that showed this is not needed. 
The House voted 77-63 to pass a bill (LD 1080) to prohibit public utilities from requiring deposits based solely on a residential customer’s income. 
Appropriations
Several bills were also moved to the “appropriations table,” where the budget committee can choose to support the measures with any remaining funds. These included: 

LD 461 “An Act to Fund Rural Patrol Services in Washington County”
LD 477 “An Act to Enhance Public Safety in Rural Counties by Providing State Police Patrol and Policing Services”
LD 1061, “An Act to Increase Community Support for Families in Maine”
LD 814 “An Act to Provide Funding to Area Agencies on Aging for Community-based Services and Programs to Support Older Adults”
LD 298 “An Act to Employ Mental Health Personnel Within the Maine State Police”

Nearly 3,0000 grocery store workers threaten strike
Nearly 3,000 workers are headed toward unfair labor practices strikes at 38 grocery stores across the Twin Cities after they rejected the latest offers from UNFI-owned Cub, Haug and Knowlan’s Festival Foods.
It was an unprecedented vote by workers who could walk off the job around Memorial Day if they don’t reach a deal with the companies, according to leaders with the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 663.
“They’re not listening. Pure and simple. They’re ignoring everything we’ve suggested,” said Nicolas McBride, assistant meat manager at Haug’s Cub in Minnetonka and member of the bargaining team.
McBride said the companies want to shift more health care costs onto workers, which would more than double his cost and eat up the modest pay raise of $3 per hour spread over the life of the three-year contract.
He also said the companies’ proposed pay raises would only kick in once the contract is ratified, with nothing retroactive to when the contract expired in March. That would add up to hundreds of dollars for workers.
“I’ve been in the union for 28 years and every single contract we’ve gotten back pay,” McBride said.
UFCW Local 663 has been negotiating with the companies since January, along with Lunds & Byerlys, Jerry’s Cub Food, Kowalski’s and Radermacher’s Cub Foods. Workers at those four companies ratified contracts over the weekend, averting a strike.
While the offers were similar, UFCW Local 663 President Rena Wong said the companies made good faith efforts to listen to workers and respond to their proposals. For example at Lunds & Bylerlys, workers wanted to raise part-time wages, particularly for the custodial staff.
“They came back and they made that change. They listened,” Wong said. “That is contrary to what UNFI, Haug’s and Knowlan’s did.”
The union has filed an unfair labor practice charge against UNFI with the National Labor Relations Board, which oversees private sector unions, alleging the company has not bargained in good faith. The union also alleges Haug’s and Knowlan’s have violated labor protections for collective bargaining.
In a statement, UNFI said it has been negotiating “diligently and in good faith” and has offered “strong wage increases, continued market-leading union health care and significant increases in our contributions to the union’s pension plan.”
Paid family and sick leave unscathed in global budget deal
Paid family leave and earned sick time came out of difficult budget negotiations largely unscathed under a deal announced by legislative leaders and Gov. Tim Walz on Thursday. The deal doesn’t have complete buy-in from progressive Senators because it would roll back access to MinnesotaCare for undocumented adults, however. Much could still change between now and the end of the session.
Paid family leave and earned sick time have faced stiff resistance from business leaders, who have found sympathetic ears among moderate Senate Democrats and newly empowered House Republicans in control of half the lower chamber.
The budget agreement would reduce the maximum payroll tax for the paid family leave program from 1.2% to 1.1%. The change may be insignificant since payroll taxes might never rise to the tax cap, depending on how many people claim benefits. The program is slated to start next year with a payroll tax of .88%, with employers paying at least half of the cost.
The tweak is far less significant than cuts proposed by two moderate Democrats and Republicans earlier this year, which would exempt businesses with 15 or fewer employees and reduce the total number of weeks employees could take off in a year from 20 to 14.
Moderate Senate Democrats also recently voted with Republicans to exempt small farms and businesses from providing paid sick and safe time — at least six days a year for full-time employees — among other changes sought by business leaders. That proposal appears to be dead.
Democrats did make concessions on unemployment insurance for hourly school workers, with legislative leaders agreeing to repeal the benefit in 2029.
School districts complained paying for unemployment for school bus drivers, paraprofessionals and cafeteria workers threatens their tight budgets and makes it harder to fill part-time summer positions. Democrats vowed to protect the benefit, although they will have to win back control of state government to do so if the deal becomes law.
Minnesota employment flat in April
Minnesota employment stayed relatively flat in April, losing 1,300 jobs out of about 3 million statewide, according to data released by the state Department of Employment and Economic Development on Thursday.
The labor market has stayed strong despite upheavals in the global economy since President Donald Trump took office and launched a trade war, halted billions in federal funding, and moved to eliminate more than 120,000 federal jobs.
DEED reported 200 federal jobs lost in Minnesota last month, a small percentage of the 18,000 federal employees in the state, not including postal workers and military personnel. Many of the Trump administration’s layoffs have been reversed or paused, while those workers who took the “Fork in the Road” buyout offer won’t show up in the data until they are off the payroll.
“We would expect to see a drop at some point, it’s just hard to say when,” said Angelina Nguyen, director of the labor market information office at DEED.
Unemployment also ticked up slightly to 3.2% in April, mainly due to 3,300 joining the labor force. The unemployment rate remains 1 percentage point lower than the national rate.
Hundreds of federal workplace safety employees reinstated
The Trump administration reinstated hundreds of laid off workers at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health this week, including those who screen coal miners for black lung and those who provide services to the first responders to the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11.
The reversal comes after intense public pressure from unions, members of Congress and a lawsuit brought by a coal miner, which led to a federal judge ordering nearly 200 workers be reinstated on Tuesday. The following day, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. told Congress 328 employees at NIOSH had been reinstated.
Some 900 workers, or more than 90% of the entire agency, were planned to be permanently cut as part of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency’s campaign to drastically shrink the size of the federal workforce.
The agency, which is part of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, helps reduce workplace injuries and illnesses across industries by investigating workplaces to mitigate exposure to toxins, inspecting personal protective equipment for nurses and firefighters, and tracking cancer in firefighters.
On Wednesday, the AFL-CIO, leading a coalition of unions, filed a lawsuit challenging the dismantling of the agency, saying it would lead to more workers dying on the job.
“Working people have fought too hard for these critical protections to now watch an unelected billionaire dismantle them and take us back to a time when chronic disease and death on the job was commonplace,” said AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler in a statement.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/493920792_1264876998972980_257142171735395332_n-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-16 11:10:49.504041

You can read more about the section here.

Several years ago, I confronted the possibility that I, like many Mississippians, had been blindsided by cancer.
A routine blood test detected alarmingly high PSA (prostate-specific antigen) levels, and after informing me that the odds were about 25% for a positive cancer diagnosis and 60% of that for an intermediate to severe form of the disease, my urologist recommended a biopsy. Those odds represented a 15% probability of a metastatic crisis, and given the low risks associated with prostate biopsies, I opted for the procedure.
After an anxious week of waiting, the pathologist’s report indicated that I had dodged the terrifying reality of cancer—unlike for the roughly 16,000 Mississippians who are diagnosed with cancer each year, with an associated annual death toll of about 6,500. 
I am a retired scientist and although my area of expertise involves field biology, my research background helped me evaluate the medical options and procedures related to prostate cancer. I could understand the relevant scientific papers and search for qualities that define good medical research: testable hypotheses, large sample sizes, replicate studies, appropriate statistical analyses and peer-reviewed papers published in reputable journals. When evaluating my options I could avoid ideologically-based claims like those promising that cod liver oil and  other vitamin A supplements are effective for preventing and treating measles.
I also understood that although the initial blood test for PSA antigens, preliminary MRI and biopsy were technological procedures, those procedures were developed through painstaking scientific research—the kinds of research carried out by institutions like the University of Mississippi Medical Center’s (UMMC) Cancer Institute, but now threatened by cuts to federal agencies such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the National Cancer Institute and National Science Foundation (NSF).

In other words, the Trump administration is directly harming the kinds of scientific research that could improve the lives of those 16,000 Mississippians who are diagnosed with cancer each year.
In 2023, the UMMC received almost $97 million in research grants, awards and contracts, much of which came from federal funding sources. Cutting NIH funding to the UMMC and other American research institutions threatens the well-being of all Mississippians, regardless of their political affiliation, age, sex, gender, race or ethnicity—or whether their health is threatened by cancer, sickle-cell anemia, heart disease, diabetes, traumatic injury or poor delivery of medical services to underserved populations. Who among us doesn’t know multiple people whose lives have been affected by those diseases or problems? Ironically, it seems that cuts to NIH funding  likely will hit “red states” like Mississippi the hardest. 
Scientific research is a human endeavor, conducted by fallible human beings, as we all are. And yet the core scientific process, which relies on experimental and observational studies, verifiable data and hypotheses that can be tested by multiple independent observers, is the only truly self-correcting discipline—one that rises above the (occasional) false leads, mistakes and pettiness of its individual practitioners to improve the quality of life for everyone.
The scientific process is why we no longer believe that cancer is caused by an excess of black bile, as did physicians in the Middle Ages. We now have targeted gene therapies that dramatically increase survival rates for many types of cancers. It is why we no longer believe that malaria is transmitted by humid and stale air.
And it is why we embrace the germ theory of disease; use antibiotics to treat a variety of diseases, from syphilis to tuberculosis; and employ vaccines to prevent or diminish the damage caused by polio, measles, rubella, whooping cough: on and on and on. The medical benefits derived from high-quality scientific research is one critical reason that average life expectancy in the United States rose from roughly 40 years in 1860 to almost 79 years in 2020. 
Of course, federal researchers and research dollars benefit many other aspects of life in Mississippi besides those related to health care. Proposed cuts to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Agricultural Research Service, which could affect as much as 50% of the workforce at some stations (there are four such stations in Mississippi, supporting research projects on everything from cotton ginning to poultry and insect pest management), would harm the productivity and competitiveness of Mississippi farmers.
Proposed cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)—54% in the Trump administration’s proposed 2026 funding bill—will hamper the ability of the EPA to clean up Mississippi’s nine active Superfund sites, which contain toxic chemicals like PCBs and dioxins.
Or take the impacts of proposed cuts to scientific research by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The Mississippi Gulf Coast is imperiled by rising sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico (almost 2°F between 1970 to 2020), driving increasingly powerful hurricanes, and a sea level rise of up to 10 millimeters/per year, which translates into almost 4 inches of sea level rise per decade, which in turn increases storm-driven flooding. Consequently, along Mississippi’s Gulf Coast homeowner’s insurance is becoming more and more expensive, while the nonrenewal rate by insurance companies is increasing.
Even if one does not “believe” in human-driven climate change, it remains imperative to study sea levels and sea surface temperatures to help protect against the harmful effects of increasingly powerful tropical storms—and the equally damaging effects on homeowner’s insurance rates and availability for Gulf Coast Mississippians.
It also is crucial that we understand the costs of extreme weather events, those causing at least $1 billion dollars, to help insurance companies, policymakers and scientists understand major disasters like the hurricanes that batter the Guld Coast of Mississippi—and yet NOAA will no longer collect these data.
Although scientific research is not primarily a jobs or economic stimulus program, federal research and development funding also contributes in vital ways to overall economic growth, maintaining America’s competitiveness on the world stage and our country’s high standard of living.
Recent analyses suggest that net economic returns for federal research and development dollars are much higher than for other forms of investment such as for physical infrastructure, and may be responsible for as much as 25% of post-World War II productivity and growth—and that contrary to claims by the current administration, public research investments are not less productive than private investments. 
I could describe many more examples of benefits provided by federal science funding, but I will end with one perplexing but illustrative story. Last February, President Trump ordered the release of billions of gallons of water from California reservoirs operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, ostensibly to benefit Central Valley farmers and help Los Angeles fight wildfires like those that devastated the area in January. However, there were no scientific justifications for President Trump’s order, as related to hydrology, irrigation or wildfire suppression
 Still, one Central Valley farmer stated that although the water release was counterproductive, “I have a conservative mindset. I encourage the trigger-pulling attitude, like: ‘Hey, let’s just get stuff done.”
Maybe there are occasions when a “trigger-pulling attitude” is appropriate. But when the gun is aimed at your own head, the results will be predictable and catastrophic—whether we’re talking ill-considered water releases from California dams or indiscriminate and draconian cuts to federal scientific agencies and research funding, which will harm the citizens of Mississippi in so many ways.

Kennedy Jr. on Wednesday told Congress the Trump administration would not cut funding for Head Start, after layoffs at the agency and funding freezes raised fears the six-decade-old program would be radically downsized.
In an appearance before a Senate subcommittee, Kennedy said the administration would “emphasize healthy eating in Head Start, and ensure the program continues to serve its 750,000 children and parents effectively.”
The early education program, which serves children from low-income and homeless families around the country, grapples with staffing shortages and many centers operate in a perpetual state of financial precarity.
[RELATED: New England Head Start office closed; federal funding in flux]
While the program has been spared from elimination, Kennedy has laid off a significant number of employees who helped the program operate and shuttered half its regional offices. Providers have experienced repeated funding delays since President Donald Trump took office, forcing some to briefly close.
In a tense exchange, Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Wisconsin Democrat, pressed Kennedy on why the federal government delayed sending funding to a Head Start operation outside Milwaukee, forcing it to close.
“What would you say to a parent who shows up for … Head Start and the doors are closed?” she asked him.
“I would be very sad,” Kennedy said. “I fought very hard to make sure Head Start gets all of its funding next year.”
Asked what was causing the delays, Kennedy said he did not know, but suggested the problem came from employees “who wanted to make the Trump administration look bad.”
Backers of Head Start had been fretting after a leaked Trump administration proposal suggested defunding it, but earlier this month a senior White House official told reporters there would be no changes to the program.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025_0414_SR_HeadStart_007-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-16 11:10:49.504041

That’s had a negative impact on commercial property values, which are linked to property taxes that the city depends on. Mayoral candidate Josh Kraft, a nonprofit executive and son of New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, said city officials should put “everything on the table to bring sources of revenue to the city,” including incentivizing businesses to move to Boston.  Wu said city budget officials are “cinching our belt even tighter,” exercising fiscal discipline by cutting hundreds of jobs that have been vacant. But she also took her first shot of the night at Kraft, pointing to his stance that the city should cut two percent from the budget. That translates into cutting police, fire and city services, she said.Kraft in turn panned her argument that the city couldn’t find small amounts in a $4.6 billion budget that can be cut. “I just find that hard to believe,” he said. “It’s easy to stand on the sidelines when you’re new to the city, new to city policymaking and say cut cut cut and not say from where,” Wu shot back, referring to Kraft moving into Boston in late 2023, ahead of his mayoral run. Two other candidates on the stage – Hyde Park activist Domingos DaRosa and Alex Alex, who decided to run after he was unable to get a city job – had their own ideas. DaRosa said the city should extract more money out of tourists who come into the city, and he suggested conducting an audit to root out misappropriated spending, while Alex suggested stricter traffic enforcement and the implementation of congestion pricing, which charges drivers a fee if they enter the city at certain times of the day. The concept has seen success this year in New York City. The mayoral forum, which lasted roughly two hours, was put together by Democratic groups and moderated by GBH News reporter Saraya Wintersmith. Wu and Kraft are so far the only candidates who have gathered more than the 3,000 signatures needed to qualify for the ballot, while another dozen have expressed interest in running. If more than two candidates get enough voter signatures by May 20, the city plans to hold a nonpartisan preliminary in September, which will winnow the field to two finalists in November. The candidates also touched on K-12 education and higher education. Asked for their priorities on improving Boston Public Schools, Wu noted that the pandemic disrupted school learning, but attendance and graduation rates are up. Kraft said he would focus on increasing literacy rates, especially in the younger grades, and expand access to vocational education.  As for the colleges and universities that power Boston’s economy, Kraft defended their focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion, which has come under attack from the Trump administration. “DEI is a crucial part of education because the more diverse an administration is, professorships are, the more you learn, the more experiences you can share with students so people have a deeper understanding,” he said. Wu said Boston should continue speaking up against the Trump administration to “create space” for universities to stand up against intimidation from Washington, D.C. DaRosa said he would like to see universities pay more in taxes to the city, while Alex called the Trump crackdown on higher education the “perfect opportunity” to reshape academia, which has benefited from the slave trade and been the “lapdogs of tyrants.” All the mayoral contenders were asked which Boston ward they live in. The boundaries of wards, a combination of precincts, are used to define key political sections in cities and towns. Wu, who lives in Roslindale, said Ward 18, as did Hyde Park’s DaRosa. “I’m embarrassed to say I don’t know,” said Kraft. Alex, who lives in Dorchester, also said he didn’t know. As the forum wrapped up, Wu leaned over to Kraft and held up three fingers, letting him know he lives in Ward 3.The post City finances top of mind in early days for Boston mayoral candidates appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250515_200822.jpg?fit=1024%2C862&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-16 11:10:49.504041

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight, via EcoFlight)Production at South Dakota’s only active, large-scale gold mine climbed to its highest level in eight years, according to a new 2024 annual report.
The Wharf Mine, owned by Chicago-based Coeur Mining, is near the city of Lead and the Terry Peak Ski Area in the northern Black Hills. The mine produced 98,042 ounces of gold last year — nearly 5,000 ounces more than the prior year.
The mine also produced 232,013 ounces of silver, which is a lesser-value “co-product” of the gold mining process. Silver production was down about 36,000 ounces from an usually high level in 2023.
To extract all of those minerals last year, miners stripped away 12.9 million tons of earth to access 5 million tons of ore.
State regulators issued a warning letter to the mine in 2021 about selenium pollution in False Bottom Creek, which flows within the mine’s boundaries. Selenium is a naturally occurring mineral in soil, but when it’s turned loose in the environment in large amounts, it can pollute water and be harmful to people and fish.
A staff member for the state Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources said Thursday during a meeting of the state Board of Minerals and Environment that the company is building a new water treatment plant to address the problem. The plant is expected to be operational by October.
The annual report says the mine employs 255 people and paid $12.5 million in state precious-metal severance taxes last year, plus nearly $800,000 in state and local sales taxes.
Coeur Mining’s annual report for investors says it sold $227.6 million worth of gold from the Wharf Mine last year, and $6.4 million worth of silver, for a total of $234 million. That was a 25% increase from 2023.
From those proceeds, the company said it made donations to 55 Black Hills-area entities, such as nonprofits and school groups, totaling $220,000.
The company operates additional mines in Nevada, Alaska and Mexico, and reported total 2024 precious-metal sales of more than $1 billion.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0415-scaled-e1684864040881-1024x692.jpg,,,2025-05-16 10:07:03.823876

His appointment signals a new chapter for the Office of the Marijuana Commissioner (OMC), the regulatory agency tasked with implementing and enforcing the Delaware Marijuana Control Act, which took effect on July 5, 2023.
OMC’s mission is to oversee the adult-use and medical marijuana industry with a focus on public health, preventing underage use, ensuring equity, and generating tax revenue through a safe and well-regulated market.
Sanderlin brings over 15 years of experience advising businesses, investors, and policymakers on marijuana regulation and public policy. As principal of Sanderlin Strategies, he has worked across multiple jurisdictions to support licensing, compliance, and the development of marijuana programs. Previously, he practiced law at Greenberg Traurig, where he represented clients in regulatory and legislative matters.
“Josh Sanderlin’s depth of regulatory experience and his focus on equity and transparency will be critical as we create a system that protects public health, promotes opportunity, and delivers on the promise of responsible legalization,” said Governor Matt Meyer.
Sanderlin holds a Juris Doctor from the Catholic University of America, a Master of Public Administration from Florida State University, and a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science from Jacksonville University. He is widely respected for his commitment to transparency, equity, and good governance in emerging industries.
OMC also recognizes the leadership of Deputy Commissioner Paul Hyland, who has played a key role in advancing the state’s marijuana program during the transitional period. “OMC is excited to welcome Commissioner Sanderlin and to hear his vision for the future of this office,” said Hyland.
“I’m honored to serve as Delaware’s Marijuana Commissioner,” said Sanderlin. “I look forward to working with the dedicated team at OMC and partners across the marijuana industry to build a safe, well-regulated market that delivers real justice and lasting benefits to all Delawareans.”

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)The Alaska Senate voted to enact new rules to streamline the voting process in Alaska and expand voter access. If signed into law, the legislation would update the state’s voter rolls, mandate that the state pay for postage for mailed ballots, introduce a new ballot tracking system, and repeal a requirement that a witness sign absentee ballots, among other changes. 
The Senate passed Senate Bill 64 along caucus lines, voting 14 to 6 on Monday. The bill now moves to the House for consideration in the last week of the legislative session. 
Sen. Bill Wielechowski, D-Anchorage and a bill supporter, called it a “compromise bill” years in the making at a news conference on Tuesday. “It includes 12 different bills that have been introduced over the years from members of all political parties — Republicans, Democrats, independents, minority and majority members,” he said. “Roughly 50% of the bill is at the request of the minority in the House and the Senate. So it is truly a compromise bill.”
Wielechowski said the first goal of the bill is to update the state’s voter rolls. “We have 106% more registered voters in the state than we have citizens, and so it takes some steps to fix that,” he said.
 
 Under SB 64, the Division of Elections would send a notice to confirm address if the voter has: 

Registered to vote in a another state
Received a driver’s license in another state
Registered a vehicle in another state
Served on a jury in another state
Obtained a resident hunting or fishing license in another state
Pays resident tuition at at university in another state
Receives a residential property tax exemption in another state
Receives public assistance in another state 



If passed, the bill clarifies residency as “as a place where a voter has a reasonable and articulable plan to return to whenever they are absent.” The bill would shorten the timeframe in which Alaskans are marked as inactive voters and can ultimately be removed from the voter rolls if they don’t vote. It also would expand the list of things that trigger notices to start that removal process.
Once those notices are sent, the voter will have a chance to respond within 45 days, or be moved to an inactive status for a period of 28 months, or two elections. In that time, a voter can confirm residency and their voter registration by contacting the division, or by voting. 
Wielechowski said the bill addresses the causes of ballots being disqualified, by eliminating the witness signature requirement for absentee ballots and allowing mistakes to be corrected ahead of Election Day. 
“It fixes a number of issues that have resulted in voters’ ballots being thrown out, particularly military voters, and particularly those in rural Alaska: There’s a witness signature problem,” he said. 
Wielechowski pointed to House District 18, which includes Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, as having the highest rate of reject ballots in the last election. 
In the 2024 general election, the state rejected 1,303 absentee ballots, or 1.7% of ballots cast. Nearly 40%, or 512 ballots were rejected due to “improper or insufficient witnessing.” That was fewer than the special election in 2022 following the death of U.S. Rep. Don Young, when over 7,500 ballots were rejected, with a third of those due to a lack of witness signature. 
If passed, the bill would allow for voters to fix minor errors, with the division notifying and allowing the voter an opportunity to correct a mistake before Election Day, a process called “ballot curing.”  
The American Civil Liberties Union of Alaska, which advocates for civil and voter rights, has been calling for both items, and supports the bill, according to Michael Garvey, its policy director.
“We’ve seen it lead to completely unnecessary rejections,” he said. 
He noted that rejection rates have been higher in rural districts, as well as districts with higher proportions of Alaska Native voters.
“And so someone who’s taken the time to fill out their ballot, put it in the mail, put a stamp on it, and a lot of cases to have that rejected, and then just to be notified that it didn’t end up counting, that’s pretty dispiriting,” Garvey said. “And so the state really should have a way to allow voters to fix that small amount of mistakes.”
The ACLU filed a lawsuit in 2022 asserting the state violated due process rights when rejecting ballots without notice or opportunity to correct errors. The Alaska Superior Court denied the motion in a January ruling, but said that the Legislature could enact a “notice-and-cure system.”
Under the legislation, voters would be notified of technical mistakes before an election and be able to correct them. Voters would not be able to open the envelope and change their vote, but be able to fix external mistakes, such as missing a signature. The division would notify the voter within 24 hours, by email or phone number, and the voter would be able to provide identification and correct the mistake by filling out and submitting a form.
The bill also establishes a new ballot tracking system, so voters can be notified when their ballot is received and counted. It also provides for paid postage for all absentee ballots.
Other new provisions in the bill include:

Adding tribal identification cards to the list of acceptable voter identification in person and by mail;
Removing hunting and fishing licenses from the list of voter identification; 
Establishing a new rural community liaison position within the Division of Elections to support rural districts, including recruitment and training of poll workers;
Requiring that secure ballot drop boxes be available at every division office, and allowing municipalities to provide drop boxes in accordance with division regulations;
Requiring the state to develop a cybersecurity program, and notify the public if there is a data breach;
Requiring that absentee ballot counting start 12 days before the election; and
Requiring the division to publish results for all rankings in the precinct results.

The Division of Elections has estimated that if passed, the bill’s new provisions, staff salaries and cost of paid postage would cost $765,000 in one-time costs and $190,000 annually. 
However, Republican members of the Senate objected to what they say is not enough security protocols to prevent opportunities for voter fraud.
“We have a moniker: You want to make it easy to vote, but hard to cheat,” said Sen. Mike Shower, R-Wasilla in an interview Thursday. “I want to be clear that I’ve never said fraud swung an election. I said I want to make sure we don’t have the potential for fraud, which I think the Division of Elections director agrees with.”

Shower also opposed several items, including ballot drop boxes, and has concerns about the language around residency and whether voter rolls are accurate or updated. He said he also has concerns that mail-in absentee ballots present a scenario where they’re fraudulently filled out, and the division cannot verify the true identity of the voter. “Who knows where they went? Who knows how many of them came back? We have no idea,” he said. 
Opponents of these proposals have pointed out that there isn’t much evidence of Alaskans committing the crime of voter fraud. The state has investigated a few cases – the current system catches when two ballots are submitted for the same voter, which has been extremely rare, and can result when a voter forgets that they had already cast a mailed ballot. 
Shower said he’s concerned about personal data breaches like in 2020, where an estimated 113,000 voters’ personal data was exposed, and he wants to see the state take more serious security protocols.
The bill is now being heard in the House Finance Committee and is expected to move to a full House vote in the final days of the session, which ends May 21.

(Provided by the S.C. Department of Corrections)COLUMBIA — A condemned inmate is scheduled for execution in one of his two death penalty cases, the state Supreme Court said in a Friday order.
Stephen Stanko, 57, is set to be put to death at 6 p.m. June 13. His execution would be the sixth in the state since the process resumed in September following an unintended 13-year hiatus.

Stanko was sentenced to death twice, in two separate cases for crimes committed within two days of each other in 2005.
The U.S. Supreme Court turned down his final appeal for a 2009 conviction earlier this month. Appeals are ongoing in his other death sentence, which a jury recommended as part of a 2006 conviction.
By law, Stanko will have until May 30, two weeks before he’s set to die, to choose his method of execution.
The death warrant comes as attorneys raise questions about the state’s protocols for execution by firing squad, an option added by legislators in 2021. Two inmates in the last two months chose to die that way.
In the most recent execution, which took place April 11, marksmen mostly missed inmate Mikal Mahdi’s heart, attorneys claimed.
An autopsy photo showed two bullet holes in his chest where attorneys would have expected three, one from each gun shot at him, attorneys said in a filing to the state Supreme Court last week.
Prison officials have said nothing went wrong. Fragments of bullets struck Mahdi’s heart, and two bullets hit the same spot and took the same trajectory through his body, explaining the two wounds, said prisons spokeswoman Chrysti Shain.
Stanko also has the option to die by lethal injection, which three of the five inmates executed in the last eight months chose, or electrocution, which no inmate in the state has selected since 2008.
Stanko’s crime spree started April 7, 2005, when he strangled his girlfriend, Laura Ling, to death at her home in Murrell’s Inlet while beating and raping her 15-year-old daughter, according to court documents. Stanko slit the daughter’s throat and left her for dead before stealing jewelry and credit cards and fleeing.
He went to his friend’s house in Conway. After having breakfast with his friend Henry Turner, Stanko shot the 74-year-old in the back while he shaved in the bathroom mirror, using a pillow as a silencer for his gun, according to court documents.
Stanko then hit Turner in the head and fatally shot him in the chest.
Driving Turner’s truck, Stanko went to Columbia, where he spent an evening buying people drinks at bars before traveling to Augusta, Georgia. There, Stanko convinced a woman he was a businessman in town for the Masters golf tournament and went home with her, according to court records.
Stanko stayed with the woman, including attending church with her, until April 12, when he left abruptly in the middle of the night. Soon after he left, the woman recognized his photo in the newspaper alongside a headline about Turner’s death and called the police, who captured Stanko before he left the city, according to court records.
During Stanko’s trials, defense attorneys argued to no avail that he was insane at the time of the killings, with decreased brain functioning making him unable to understand right and wrong.
A jury convicted Stanko in 2006 of killing Ling and beating and raping her daughter. A separate jury convicted him in 2009 of killing Turner. Both juries recommended death sentences, which multiple courts have affirmed.
Turner’s killing is the crime for which Stanko is set to be put to death in June.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/execution.jpg,,,2025-05-16 10:07:03.823876

Financial institutions serving Delaware’s underserved neighborhoods now have a new opportunity to support local economic growth, thanks to a newly launched state fund aimed at increasing access to capital in low- to moderate-income areas.
The Delaware Council on Banking has opened applications for the Delaware Community Investment Venture Fund (DCIVF), a program designed to help banks, credit unions, and Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) develop and deploy innovative financial products in communities that have historically lacked access to capital and financial services.
“The Delaware Community Investment Venture Fund reflects our ongoing commitment to fostering equitable economic development across the state,” said Governor Matt Meyer. “By providing targeted support to financial institutions serving low-to-moderate-income communities, we are strengthening the foundation for inclusive growth and long-term prosperity in Delaware.”

Eligible institutions can apply for grants that support projects aimed at developing and testing new financial products, underwriting tools, or services.
The goal is to enhance access to funding and capital for businesses operating in underserved areas.
“I created the community investment venture fund to build an economic ecosystem that provides more access to capital,” said Sen. Darius Brown, D-Wilmington. “Commerce is the life’s blood of our economy and through intentional investments, we are the place where opportunity lives.”
Applications for the DCIVF opened on May 15, and must be submitted by 5 p.m. on June 16.
An optional virtual information session will be held on May 22 at 3 p.m. for interested applicants.
“The Fund aligns with our regulatory priorities of ensuring fair access to financial services and strengthening the safety and soundness of institutions serving vulnerable communities,” said State Bank Commissioner Robert Glen. “We encourage banks, credit unions, and CDFIs to apply.”

Assanis, who has served as the University’s 28th president since 2016, announced his plans to step down on June 30.
Carlson, who joined UD in 2022 as its 12th provost, expressed gratitude for the opportunity to lead the institution during the transition period.
According to Kelly, the board will launch a national search for a permanent president during the upcoming academic year.
As provost, Carlson has played a central role in advancing the University’s academic mission.
Her initiatives have included integrating long-term financial, enrollment and hiring strategies, expanding academic offerings, and fostering innovation through programs like the New Program Incubator and the One Idea, One Slide Summit.
She has also been an advocate for improving academic spaces and creating flexible pathways for students to complete their degrees.
Before joining UD, Carlson held multiple leadership roles over more than two decades at the University of Notre Dame.
Her career there included service as vice president, associate provost, and dean of the Graduate School, where she emphasized holistic student development and strategic planning.
An expert in spatial cognition, Carlson holds a Ph.D. from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and is widely published in her field.
She has served on editorial boards of leading cognitive science journals and governing boards of professional societies.
The transition marks a pivotal moment for the University as it begins the process of identifying its next permanent leader.
“I am honored and humbled to be stepping in to guide this very special institution, and I thank the Board of Trustees for their confidence and support,” Carlson said. “I look forward to convening campus conversations this summer and fall to reaffirm our mission and identity and to together design a path forward that is uniquely our own.”",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/provost-carlson-laura-portraits-061022-003-udaily-story-page-800x533-1.jpg,,,2025-05-16 10:07:03.823876

(Stock photo by Daniel de la Hoz/Getty Images)Iowa State University scientists say their research could lead to better methods of recognizing when someone is experiencing mental health struggles based on their online presence, making it easier to offer resources to those in need.
ISU assistant professor of information systems and business analytics Wenli Zhang, in collaboration with researchers at universities in Delaware and Rhode Island, has developed a “deep learning model” for detecting mental health symptoms on social media, The model factors in more than just positive and negative sentiments on a subject that a person might post online.
This method could and would not replace medical diagnoses, Zhang said. But in the future, she said, the learning model could be used as a tool to provide additional information and resources to those expressing symptoms of mental health issues and to study population-level data over a period of time.
“Maybe we can use big data and machine learning to help … this process,” Zhang said. “Because nowadays, not just in the United States or other countries but in the entire world, mental disorders, especially depression, are underdiagnosed and undertreated.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The team used a large dataset sourced from Reddit by a different group and offered to researchers for their own work, Zhang said, but the learning model her group created allowed them to dive deeper than others.
Zhang said the goal behind deep learning is to use data to identify patterns in order to detect connections and predict outcomes. As social media data is much more than just numbers in rows and columns, she said the model used to sift through it needed to be intricate.
“When we have unstructured data, like natural language or images, the patterns are very complicated,” Zhang said. “The size of the inputs are very large, so we need a very complex model to … identify the patterns.”
The difference between the team’s new deep learning model and others is what data it pulled as evidence of possible mental health symptoms, Zhang said.
While previous research has relied on “sentiment scores” calculated by finding language expressing someone’s positive or negative emotions in their posts, Zhang said they found little connection between these scores and depression diagnoses. Posters could be referring to something specific they did or didn’t like, she said, like movies or music, which is not what researchers were looking for.
Instead of trying to employ the same method, Zhang said the team turned to language used in more clinical settings when it comes to research and diagnosis, then tried matching it to more natural text and speech.
One example she gave was the term “attempted suicide” — found in clinical writing, but not often on social media. The team used “natural language processing techniques” to link informal language from Reddit to formal terms, Zhang said, then looked at how many times the poster would “mention the symptoms or treatments or major life events that may exacerbate mental disorders.”
Zhang said her experience with modeling such as this comes from her background working in health care analytics during her Ph.D. studies. She used machine learning to track social media data to detect symptoms of asthma and other conditions.
When she came to ISU and began teaching, Zhang said she found depression and other mental health conditions to be a big issue. She said she hopes that in the future, the model can be used by social media platforms as a tool to support at-risk people, like providing a pop-up message with relevant resources and the statement that they are not alone.
“Maybe they can use our tools to identify, maybe, the teenagers that need more help, or maybe senior people that need more help,” Zhang said.

From CalMatters politics reporter Yue Stella Yu: 
In the state Legislature, an open rebellion sometimes does wonders. 
Two weeks ago, Assemblymember Maggy Krell, a first-year Sacramento Democrat, publicly defied Democratic leaders in attempting to pass harsher penalties for soliciting sex from 16- and 17-year-olds. Joined by some moderate Democrats and Republicans, the fight laid bare the splinters among Democrats and forced Assembly leaders into damage control mode. 
The end result? An overwhelming Assembly vote on Thursday to raise penalties for teen sex solicitation, with no votes in opposition. 
The measure — amended after a weeklong negotiation between Krell and Assembly Democratic leaders — would allow prosecutors to charge someone soliciting sex from a child more than three years younger than them with a felony. It would also increase the fines on businesses and hotels for facilitating or shielding sex trafficking activities and require the Office of Emergency Services to fund up to 11 district attorneys’ efforts to prosecute human trafficking. 
It was a victory lap for Republicans, who have long fought to enhance punishments for child sex trafficking and solicitation. During a Thursday press conference, they urged Senate Democrats, who will consider the measure next, to leave it intact.

Assemblymember Carl DeMaio of San Diego: “Don’t you dare water down a word in AB 379 as passed today. We will not tolerate any weakening of the tools that law enforcement needs to protect these children.”

It is unclear how Senate Democrats will respond. Last year, Senate Democrats removed provisions from a Republican-backed proposal that would have applied harsher penalties to soliciting 16- and 17-year-olds — the same provisions that Krell unsuccessfully fought for this year. 
Krell, who was stripped off of the bill as a principal author after her defiance, told CalMatters she is “thankful” to others for cooperating. 
Her takeaway after all this drama? 

Krell: “I’m easy to work with, hard to f—k with.”

Support for Hollywood, not so much for news

As California faces a $12 billion budget shortfall, Gov. Gavin Newsom is pushing to expand support for one industry, while reducing support for another. 
In recent years California’s film industry has been struggling due to pandemic-era production shutdowns, labor strikes, deadly wildfires and competitive tax incentives offered by other states. 
The Legislature is considering a bill that would expand the state’s film and television tax credits and set aside as much as $750 million annually to film production. It would also raise the tax break applicants can receive, and extend the credit to live action and animated series. 
The bill is backed by motion picture studios, unions representing entertainment industry workers and Newsom, who told reporters on Wednesday, “we need to step things up,” when it comes to supporting the state’s film industry.
At the same time, the governor wants to reduce the first-year payment the state is required to provide to help fund local news outlets from $30 million to $10 million. H.D. Palmer, a spokesperson for the Department of Finance, said in an email the proposed cut is due to “fewer resources than projected in the January budget.”
The money stems from a deal lawmakers brokered with Google last year: To support California’s beleaguered journalism industry, the state and the tech giant agreed to put millions of dollars into a fund to be distributed to outlets over five years. In exchange, the Legislature pulled two bills that would have forced tech companies to pay outlets for their content. To date, no money has been distributed to news outlets.

GOP wants to preempt state AI laws, including CA

Though it’s unlikely that a congressional bill to implement a decade-long ban on state governments from regulating artificial intelligence will pass out of the U.S. Senate, proponents of AI regulation are still ringing alarm bells about the bill’s broad implications.
As CalMatters’ Khari Johnson explains, Republicans from the U.S. House of Representatives included the AI proposal in a sweeping budget reconciliation bill. On Wednesday the House approved that budget bill along party lines. Now sitting before the Senate, the AI proposal faces tough odds since federal rules require that budget reconciliation bills be strictly related to fiscal matters.
But if passed, the legislation would make enforcing over 20 laws California passed last year illegal. It would also jeopardize 30 bills the state Legislature is currently considering to regulate AI, including ones to protect consumers from AI-powered price gouging, or require reporting when health insurance companies use AI to deny care.
Proponents of the bill say a moratorium is necessary to resolve a patchwork of state regulation. But the proposal also aligns with efforts by the President Donald Trump administration to curb AI regulation, which it argues stifles innovation. A White House plan to advance the AI industry’s growth by lifting some regulations is expected this summer.

And lastly: Mental health crisis calls

If you live in Sacramento County and you call the Sheriff’s Department because someone in your family is having a mental health crisis, there’s a chance they may not come. That’s because of a new policy that says deputies will only respond to those calls if a crime has already occurred, is in progress or the person in crisis is putting someone else in imminent danger. 
But this isn’t just a Sacramento issue. An investigation by CalMatters contributor Lee Romney has found that other police agencies are also backing away from mental health crisis calls. 
This week Lee joined the health policy podcast Tradeoffs to break down her findings. Listen here.

Gary Peters.
They wanted Peters to pressure the Trump administration to lift the funding freeze on $20 million in “community change grants” promised by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to houses of worship across Detroit to create community resilience hubs powered by renewable energy — offering shelter during weather emergencies and utility outages.
More than three months later, spring has come to Michigan — and yet the expected $2 million in funding for the St. Suzanne Cody Rouge Community Resource Center in Detroit remains on ice.
St. Suzanne Executive Director Steve Wasko says his organization — which provides meals, clothing, day care and other programs for residents of this predominantly Black neighborhood — has “received conflicting and sometimes contradictory communication about the grant.”
Wasko had been promised funding to install heat pumps, solar panels and a generator, among other upgrades. The retrofit would allow St. Suzanne to help more people while cutting an energy bill that can run up to $15,000 a month in the winter.

(Courtesy of Michigan Interfaith Power & Light)
The funding freeze is just the latest setback for poor communities of color across the United States — including in Detroit, Los Angeles and Philadelphia — that are being left behind in the transition to cleaner, cheaper power.
Neighborhoods like Cody Rouge suffer from underpowered electrical service, more frequent power outages and high energy bills — a legacy of the once-legal practice of redlining that robbed communities of color of financial and public services, Floodlight found.
In formerly redlined neighborhoods like Cody Rouge, shutoffs for non-payment are more likely. And poverty limits access to renewable energy: Aging roofs can’t support solar panels, outdated wiring can’t handle new heaters, and old electrical infrastructure struggles to accommodate electric vehicle charging and solar arrays.
“It’s now very clear that energy services, ranging from quality of service to price of service, are disproportionately poor if you are a minority, a woman or of low income,” said Daniel Kammen, professor of energy at the University of California-Berkeley.
 Little money, high bills

High energy costs are a burden across Detroit. A quarter of the metro area’s poorest households spend at least 15% of their income to power and heat their homes, according to a Floodlight analysis of data from the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE).
Across the United States, a quarter of all low-income households — roughly 23 million people — struggle to pay their energy bills. In most major U.S. cities including Detroit and Philadelphia, these one out-of-four low-income households pay 15% or more of their incomes on average on electricity, cooling and heat. In Los Angeles, this group pays just over 14% of their household income on utility bills.
These energy burdens have persisted for decades despite billions of dollars from federal and state governments subsidizing electricity bills in low-income communities. And now, Trump has gutted the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which provides heating and cooling subsidies for 6 million U.S. households.

Other policy solutions face significant challenges. Energy subsidy programs suffer from low enrollment. Collective “community solar” efforts capable of bringing cheap renewable power to renters and the urban poor are stymied by utilities or not made available to folks with lower incomes.
During the Biden administration, tens of billions of dollars were allocated by Congress to help socially vulnerable groups participate in the energy transition. Trump froze much of that funding. Repeated court orders to resume the funding have been ignored or only partially honored. The chaos has only deepened advocates’ concern that the disparities in America’s electric grid will persist — and perhaps even deepen.
“The current energy system has this imbalance, but if we don’t fix that, we’ll continue down that path, even as we transition to a cleaner, greener energy system,” said Tony Reames, professor of environmental justice at the University of Michigan.
 Energy inequality across America

In some states, minority communities are more likely to lose power. And in others, Black and brown residents are more likely to have their power shut off for nonpayment. Because of gaps in data collection, a clear national picture of energy inequality is difficult to see. Across the United States, counties with high minority populations in Arkansas, Louisiana and Michigan are disproportionately prone to having long blackouts, according to a 2023 study in Nature Communications.
At least 3 million Americans face disconnection each year because they can’t afford utility bills, with Hispanic and Black households being four and three times more likely to be disconnected, respectively, according to the Energy Justice Lab, which tracks disconnections.
That number could be much higher, though, since only 28 states require their utilities to disclose disconnections, meaning no data is available for 44% of the country, according to Selah Goodson Bell, an energy justice campaigner with the Center for Biological Diversity.
 The redlined grid

And in certain cities, the inequality extends to the very structure of the grid itself.
In Detroit and California, advocates and scientists have found that outdated utility infrastructure is concentrated in predominantly minority areas. This barrier may limit those neighborhoods’ ability to access renewable energy technologies such as rooftop solar, battery storage and electric-vehicle charging, which can lower energy costs.
When the lights flicker or go out in Detroit’s poorest neighborhoods, it’s often because of the electrical distribution grid.

Today in Motor City, many low-income residents get their power through DTE Energy’s 4.8-kilovolt (kV) electric system, which struggles to keep up with the changing climate. Whiter, wealthier suburbs of Detroit are serviced by a more modern 13.8-kV grid. In rate cases, activists have accused DTE of prioritizing infrastructure upgrades in wealthier, whiter communities while leaving Black and brown neighborhoods with outdated and unreliable service.
Across the city, power lines and transformers are decades past their intended lifespan, leading to frequent outages and prolonged blackouts. Aging infrastructure, beset by summer heat waves and winter storms, led to almost 45% of customers suffering eight or more hours of service disruptions in 2023. A company spokesperson notes it improved reliability by 70% between 2023 and 2024.
“I know after three days without power, the strands of civilization get tested,” said Jeff Jones, Detroit resident and executive director of Hope Village Revitalization, a nonprofit community development corporation. “It can get really frightening.”
DTE says it has committed to improving the grid, citing a $1.2 billion investment in downtown Detroit’s infrastructure and a push to prioritize grid upgrades in vulnerable communities.
Lauren Sarnacki, a senior communications strategist at DTE, said the company also helped connect customers to nearly $144 million in energy assistance last year. And the utility runs a pilot program for households earning up to 200% of the federal poverty level, capping their energy costs at 6% of their income.
One Black church in Metro Detroit did not wait for the grid to improve. Last fall, New Mount Hermon Missionary Baptist Church weatherized, upgraded its heating system and installed solar panels and a battery with the assistance of the nonprofit Michigan Interfaith Power & Light and a state grant.

The solar array and battery give community members a chance to warm up or cool down in the building when the power is out in the neighborhood, said the church’s deacon, Wilson Moore.
“For the church itself, we’ve cut costs as far as energy consumption almost 40, 45% — and that’s without even solar panels up,” he said.
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power also operates a 4.8-kV distribution grid in certain neighborhoods, including in Boyle Heights, a predominantly hispanic East LA enclave that was once redlined and has now begun to gentrify.
There, aging transformers and outdated service lines mean that businesses installing EV fast-charging stations or anyone trying to plug in a large solar array may have to pay for grid upgrades, according to an NREL study. “Grid limitations could limit the success of other clean energy equity programs,” the study concluded.
 The shadow of redlining remains

Old roofs also are a major barrier to rooftop solar adoption across Los Angeles, according to Alex Turek, deputy director at GRID Alternatives Greater Los Angeles, a nonprofit that deploys renewable energy in low-income neighborhoods. “I think 70% or more of our folks who we build trust with, who are ready to move forward, can’t then adopt solar because their roofs are old and can’t support the weight,” Turek said.

Floodlight spoke to 18 organizations attempting to deploy renewable energy in low-income communities across the country. All of them said that poor housing stock, which is often concentrated in formerly redlined neighborhoods, was a major barrier to their work.
For renters and apartment dwellers, community solar may be a solution by allowing low-income residents “a way of dividing up an array and sharing it among multiple people,” said Alan Drew, a regional organizer with the Climate Witness project, a faith-based climate nonprofit.
Programs in 24 states and Washington, D.C., support this form of collective solar energy, which generates enough energy to power more than million homes, according to a yearly survey from the NREL. Most of the locations also offer financial assistance for low-income households to access this form of energy, according to the NREL study.
However, in Michigan and Pennsylvania, investor-owned utilities have stymied the adoption of community solar. California has 13 solar projects built on the community solar model, but only one — the Anza community solar project in Santa Rosa — is dedicated to low- and medium income customers.

The state does have the Solar on Multifamily Housing (SOMAH) program that has subsidized over 700 solar arrays on multifamily affordable housing units, bringing costs down for some 50,000 apartments. The program makes sure that the cost savings don’t just go to the landlord.
“The smart policy design feature of the SOMAH program is that at least 50% of the system has to benefit the tenants,” said Turek, of GRID Alternatives.
 Solar helps cool city 

On sweltering afternoons in Hunting Park, the heat rises in waves from the asphalt, baking the brick rowhouses. The Philadelphia neighborhood’s sparse tree cover offers little relief — only 9% of it is shaded, compared to 20% of the city overall.
The effect is brutal. With much of its land covered in concrete, brick and blacktop, temperatures in Hunting Park can soar as much as 22 degrees higher than in other parts of Philadelphia. That difference translates directly into higher electricity bills as residents struggle to cool aging homes never built for such extreme heat.
Charles Lanier, executive director of the Hunting Park Community Revitalization Corp., said some residents pay as much as 40% of their incomes just to heat and cool their homes.

“I’ve seen bills as high as $5,000,” Lanier said. “It’s a problem across the board in marginalized communities here in the city of Philadelphia.”
In Hunting Park and in low-income neighborhoods across the City of Brotherly Love, the Philadelphia Energy Authority has braided together several grant and funding streams to repair, weatherize, electrify and add solar power to some 200 low-income homes across the city in a state where community solar is not allowed.
The agency also runs Solarize Philly, a program that has helped install solar on some 3,300 homes, including low- to moderate income households.
“We think low-income solar is the best way to create long-term affordable housing,” said Emily Schapira, CEO of Philadelphia’s Energy Authority.
Lanier has seen the value of solar firsthand.
“Here at our office we have installed rooftop solar panels. Our electric bill has gone from $100,” he added, “to almost zero.”

Gavin Newsom’s latest budget proposal lays out deep cuts to public universities and health care.

Gov. Gavin Newsom’s latest budget proposal lays out deep cuts to public universities and health care. It also seeks to more than double the tax credits for Hollywood studios — an expansion moving smoothly through the state Legislature.


Staring down a $12 billion budget deficit, Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed steep cuts to California’s health care services and public universities — all while promising more dollars to Hollywood.
Newsom on Wednesday doubled down on his proposal to expand the state’s investment in film and television tax credits, incentives created by then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2009 to boost California’s marquee industry. If passed, the state would allocate up to $750 million each year to film production, up from the current $330 million. 
Despite saying that any funding request from Los Angeles unrelated to disaster recovery would be a “non-starter,” Newsom deemed the tax credit expansion essential to reviving an ailing industry. 
“It’s on life support,” he told reporters. “We need to step things up, and this is all part and parcel of economic recovery, economic growth.”
Newsom’s plan would also increase the amount each qualified applicant can receive, extend the credit to live action and animated series and devote more money toward independent films.
But his proposal has drawn criticism from both Democrats and Republicans who argue the state should prioritize essential programs in a tight budget year. Assembly Republican Leader James Gallagher of Chico called Newsom’s proposal “tone-deaf.”
“I’m not sure the rest of California will be OK with their senior programs, their disability programs, their education programs being cut in order to prop up a regional industry,” said Assemblymember Corey Jackson, a Moreno Valley Democrat. 
Some lawmakers warned that other states could respond with even more aggressive incentives, creating a “race to the bottom.” 
“It seems eminently predictable that we will be back next year with a proposal that says: ‘We’ve fallen behind again. I don’t know what happened. And now we need to do more,’” said Sen. Christopher Cabaldon, a Napa Democrat, in March. 
Despite those concerns, the proposal has advanced in the state Legislature with little resistance. Assemblymember Jesse Gabriel, a Los Angeles Democrat who chairs the powerful budget committee, told CalMatters that anyone seeking large funding increases this year “should stop wasting people’s time” because there isn’t enough money.
Newsom’s proposal is different, Gabriel said, because it would expand a longstanding, tested program that would also help offset the impact of the LA wildfires.
For Newsom, a lame-duck governor with presidential ambitions, expanding the tax credits could please the wealthy Hollywood donors who could propel his campaign. 
But the handout can easily be portrayed as a tax break for the rich.
“The ads kind of make themselves,” said Kim Nalder, a political science professor at California State University, Sacramento. “It’s been effective in previous years to … use (Hollywood) as an example of unserious, privileged waste.”
Saving Hollywood
Hollywood has suffered. A “quadruple-whammy” of the COVID-19 pandemic that shut down productions, a Hollywood writers strike, deadly wildfires and growing production incentives from other states that lured movies out of California have decreased its nationwide share in film industry employment from 54% in 2010 to 46% in 2023, according to the bill analysis. Film production levels in Los Angeles also saw a sharp drop-off in recent years.
The industry is also struggling to compete globally, so much so that even President Donald Trump has weighed in, ordering a 100% tariff on overseas productions, though he has given no details. In response, Newsom has offered to work with Trump to develop a $7.5 billion federal tax credit. 
“I applaud President Trump for recognizing that we are losing a lot of films to foreign countries, and I hope he steps up,” Newsom said Wednesday.

The proposed state film tax credit expansion has united motion picture studios and entertainment industry workers, but it is the unions that have been leading the fight. 
The groups backing the plan have poured at least $8.4 million into lawmakers’ coffers since 2015, including nearly $6.5 million from the California State Council of Laborers alone, according to an analysis of CalMatters’ Digital Democracy database. Walt Disney, a top supporter, has given nearly $750,000 to lawmakers since 2015.
Dozens of unionized workers have filled legislative hearing rooms and spilled into the hallways as they testify in support. 
“We are the thousands of artisans whose names whip by in the credit roll at the end of the movie. Not those that appear in huge letters and fade slowly at the beginning of the movie. We don’t go to the award shows. We work the award shows,” said Renata Ray, representing a chapter of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees.
Nalder said that is a smart political move since labor unions hold so much political sway with Democratic lawmakers. 
And the tax credit expansion “touches both the struggling workers as well as international mega-stars,” said Thad Kousser, a political science professor at University of California-San Diego. 
Still, the funding could backfire on Newsom as he eyes a potential White House run in 2028.
“You’ve got to think about policies’ effect on your core supporters … but also the average voters in places like Iowa, New Hampshire, who may not see someone who’s helping bail out Hollywood as someone taking the nation in the direction they want to see,” Kousser said.
Do film tax credits work?
California’s film tax credit was created in response to other states’ incentives. As of last year, 37 states had similar incentives. California’s program is often compared to the unlimited tax credit in Georgia, a frequent destination for film production, and New York’s incentives, which were raised last week, from $700 million to $800 million a year. 
But California’s program is unique: It is the only state to award credits based on the likelihood of a project creating jobs and boosting the economy. It is also one of the few states to prohibit using the tax credits to pay “above-the-line” crews, such as directors, actors or writers. 
The nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office said there is “good evidence that tax credits increase production activity” and it could increase the size of the state’s film industry.
That is partly because some studios choose to film elsewhere when they are denied tax incentives. Between 2011 and 2013, roughly two thirds of the applicants who did not receive tax credits in California shot out of state, according to a 2016 report by the legislative analyst. And between 2020 and 2023, almost 60% of applicants who were denied the tax credits produced out of state, according to a 2023 report by the California Film Commission, which administers the credits.
But would the tax credit boost the state’s broader economy? Research is mixed.
A study of California’s first film tax credit program, which used a lottery system to award credits, found major studios that received the incentives spent and hired more in California. 
Supporters of the California proposal, such as Assembly Democratic Caucus Chair Rick Zbur, a Los Angeles lawmaker who introduced the legislation — argue that the program “pays for itself.” They frequently cite a 2023 analysis by the nonprofit Los Angeles Economic Development Corporation which concluded that for every dollar the state spent on the tax credits, state and local governments collected $1.07 in tax revenue. It also said each dollar invested led to $24.40 in economic activity and $8.60 in increased wages.  
“Every show that shoots in California supports hundreds of jobs. It pumps money into local economies from lumber yards to restaurants, from car rentals to dry cleaners,” said Ed Lammi, a former Sony Pictures Television executive, in an opinion piece citing the research.
The study was prepared for the Motion Picture Association, one of the legislation’s top supporters. The association has given lawmakers $168,000 since 2015, Digital Democracy data shows. 
But while some studies show some evidence that filmmakers are drawn to states with better incentives, the legislative analyst’s office and most researchers have concluded that states almost always lose money on such programs, and that the credits have little to no effect on a state’s economic growth or its job market. 
Michael Thom, a professor at the University of Southern California, wrote to lawmakers in March that his research showed the programs generally failed to create jobs or increase wages. “Simply put, California cannot afford the existing incentive, much less a substantial expansion to it,” he said. 
Mike Gatto, a Los Angeles Democrat who authored the first expansion of the film tax credit program in 2014, said he is skeptical about subsidizing the film industry without addressing the root causes of its problems.
“It is doubtful that the amount of money that the state gives to this industry proves to be something that we get back,” he said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/010425_Golden-Globes_GETTY_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-16 09:07:37.508601

California leaders are alarmed.,"In summary
House Republicans want to ban state AI regulations for 10 years. California leaders are alarmed.




House Republicans moved to cut off artificial intelligence regulation by the states before it can take root, advancing legislation in Congress that, in California, would make it unlawful to enforce more than 20 laws passed by the Legislature and signed into law last year.
The moratorium, bundled in to a sweeping budget reconciliation bill this week, also threatens 30 bills the California Legislature is currently considering to regulate artificial intelligence, including one that would require reporting when an insurance company uses AI to deny health care and another that would require the makers of AI to evaluate how the tech performs before it’s used to decide on jobs, health care, or housing.
The California Privacy Protection Agency sent a letter to Congress Monday that says the moratorium “could rob millions of Americans of rights they already enjoy” and threatens critical privacy protections approved by California voters in 2020, such as the right to opt out of business use of automated decisionmaking technology and transparency about how their personal information is used.
If passed, the law would stop legislative efforts in the works nationwide. Lawmakers from 45 states are or have considered nearly 600 draft bills to regulate artificial intelligence this year, according to the Transparency Coalition, a group that tracks AI policy efforts by state lawmakers and supports legislation to regulate the technology.
The measure was introduced by Congressman Brett Guthrie, a Republican from Kentucky and chair of the House Energy and Commerce committee who said the legislation is necessary to resolve a patchwork of state regulation. On Wednesday, members of Congress in that House committee voted 30-24 along party lines to approve the budget reconciliation bill that includes the moratorium on state AI regulation. It will now advance to the House floor and potentially the Senate, where some observers say it faces an uphill battle against rules that limit policy changes in budget proposals.
As written, the moratorium would lift after 10 years. But it would have plenty of impact in the meantime, said Ben Winters, an attorney for the Consumer Federation of America. In California, he thinks the legislation could halt efforts by the Privacy Protection Agency to regulate automated decisionmaking, prevent enforcement of laws to protect voters from deepfakes and short circuit draft bills aimed at protecting people from discrimination and landlords who use AI to raise rent prices.
“If this bill were to pass, California couldn’t protect its citizens from exactly those harms,” he said.
Companies and lobbyists are attempting to use Washington D.C. to undermine California’s legislative AI leadership, said state Sen. Josh Becker, a Democrat from Menlo Park, in the heart of Silicon Valley. Becker has authored or coauthored a number of bills regulating AI, including one signed into law that requires AI makers provide tools to consumers so they know when generative AI is in use and another that seeks to prevent health insurance companies from unfairly using AI to deny people health care.
“If this bill were to pass, California couldn’t protect its citizens from exactly those harms.”Ben Winters, attorney for the Consumer Federation of America, on AI harms like deepfakes, discrimination and algorithmic price setting.
“This is an effort to tell people when something was created by AI, and so if this gets delayed for a year or two or 10 it’s going to have really negative consequences,” he said.
What’s unclear, he said, is exactly what regulation is covered by the moratorium. Would it, for example, wipe out privacy protections that Californians enjoy, and which were targeted by Congressional legislation last year? And how would it affect a bill Becker authored that gives people a way to quickly delete personal information collected by data brokers, set to go into effect next January?
“If they preempt that, it’s really negative for the country,” he said. “We’re [California] big enough that we can influence the country on our own, but if they preempt what we’re doing then it’s up to the federal government who has been unable to act on these issues.”
Momentum for AI harms — and, possibly, for curbs on regulation
For all the worry, the moratorium is dead on arrival if it reaches the U.S. Senate, said Gus Rossi, director of public policy and strategy at Omidyar Network, which funds public interest AI projects and tracks AI regulation. 
That’s because a federal regulation known as the Byrd rule requires that budget reconciliation bills be related to fiscal matters, and, in Rossi’s reading at least,  a 10-year moratorium on AI regulation doesn’t fit that definition. But Rossi still thinks people should take it seriously, arguing that it’s an attempt by House Republicans to establish a marker on what they think should be the approach to AI legislation, and a sign of things to come.
“The action is in the states, not D.C.,” he said. “That’s why some people in D.C. are trying to stop states.. particularly California, who’s leading the pack.”
If this bill or a similar one in the future passes, Rossi expects it would get challenged in court and put a chilling effect on efforts to regulate AI by state lawmakers.
It’s unclear whether it’s legal for the federal government to make a blanket moratorium on state regulation, said Winters, who worked in the U.S. Department of Justice during the Biden administration.
He agrees that the Byrd rule means the bill is unlikely to pass if it reaches the U.S. Senate, though Republicans may connect it to a $500 million plan to invest in AI for federal agencies and argue that it’s essential to limit state regulation in order to carry out certain budget provisions.
The House bill makes exceptions for states to continue enforcing some laws related to AI, such as laws that enable more use of AI or that are intended to improve government efficiency. It’s reasonable to interpret that exception to mean states like California could continue enforcing privacy law if this bill passed, said Amba Kak, codirector of The AI Now Institute, a research and equitable AI advocacy organization. But that’s risky.
“We can’t count on the fact that courts will see it this way, especially in the context of an otherwise sweeping moratorium with the clear intention to clamp down on AI-related enforcement,” she said.
A House AI task force spent years discussing areas of bipartisan agreement and possible bills to pass to regulate AI, New York Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said in a hearing about the moratorium, but Congress was unable to pass any of that legislation. During that time, people committed suicide from their interactions with chatbots and kids and teens were harmed by falsely generated sexually exploitative deepfakes, and so states decided to act to do things like force AI chatbots to protect the private information of people seeking mental health care in Utah and require chatbots include a protocol for when someone expresses the desire to commit self harm in New York. 
“All of these protections are protections that Congress refuses to take up, refuses, and so states are taking up this responsibility,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “Let states protect people. A moratorium is a deeply dangerous idea at this moment.”
“All of these protections are protections that Congress refuses to take up.”Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democratic congresswoman, on state AI regulations
Congresswoman Doris Matsui, a Democrat from the Sacramento area,  echoed Ocasio-Cortez at the hearing, saying,  “We can’t shoot ourselves in the foot by stopping the good work states have done and will continue to do.” 
Supporters of the moratorium identify different sorts of harm if it doesn’t pass. A patchwork of state regulations of AI “is the fastest way to secure Chinese dominance of AI,” said Jay Obernolte, a Republican from California and co-chair of the House AI task force. He supports a moratorium and preemption of state law by federal law, and if Congress fails to act, he said the people it will hurt most are entrepreneurs who can’t afford to follow regulatory regimes passed by different states.
“The most destructive thing is if there’s fear out there that every few years as the winds of political fortune shift, the rules governing the use of AI completely change,” he said during the hearing.
Broader pushback against AI regulation
The proposed moratorium is in line with efforts to prevent regulation of AI by President Donald Trump and Vice President J.D. Vance, who say such regulations will stifle innovation. A White House plan to promote growth of the AI industry and likely reduce regulation is due out by this summer. Companies like Amazon, Google, Meta, and big businesses who use AI  have lobbied in Sacramento and Washington D.C. to prevent regulation of the technology. 
Guthrie’s proposal comes a few days after Sen. Ted Cruz, a Republican from Texas, pushed for “light touch” AI regulation to ensure the United States maintains AI supremacy over other nations and to, in Cruz’s words, “prevent needless state over-regulation.”
The intent of Guthrie’s bill, Winters believes, is to send a signal to tech companies and open up the door to possible future legislation if the budget reconciliation bill fails to pass. It’s a trend consistent with Senator Cruz’s statement last week and efforts to remove red tape for data center projects on federal land.
“I’d describe this as.. explicitly saying we are supporting the AI companies more than the American people,” he said. “We’re seeing an explicit turn toward a deregulatory state.”
Federal lawmakers have steadily increased the number of bills they propose related to AI in recent years, but they have passed relatively few of them into law, according to the AI Index report. Out of more 220 bills proposed last year, only four passed.
By contrast, state lawmakers passed more than 130 bills to regulate AI last year. California passed 22 bills last year, more than any other state, and attempted to harmonize its rules with the European Union’s AI Act and other U.S. states. The 2024 State of State Tech Policy report found a 163% increase in tech policy proposals by state lawmakers last year compared to 2023. That trend is driven by one-party control in the vast majority of state houses across the country.
The adage that states are the laboratories of democracy is still true, said ​​Scott Brennen, a coauthor of the State of State Tech Policy report, so shutting down their ability to see what they can cover and try out different approaches doesn’t seem like a good idea, and could undercut the federal government’s ability to make better policy. Since AI is getting integrated into an ever-wider range of tools and platforms, Guthrie’s moratorium appears to apply widely, he added, including to social media platforms, ongoing efforts by states to protect children online, and data privacy protections that address automated decision making.
“I don’t necessarily think state regulation of AI is always the best course of action, there are definitely areas like consumer data protection where it would be better if the federal government took the lead, but the federal government isn’t taking the lead,” he said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/051325-US-Capitol-AP-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-16 09:07:37.508601

Now the state is pulling back some of its commitments. Google could follow suit.,"In summary
Google and California struck a deal last year to fund local news. Now the state is pulling back some of its commitments. Google could follow suit.


A controversial $125 million deal California struck with Google last year to prop up the state’s struggling journalism industry is already on track to shrink — before any of the money has been delivered to news outlets.
The deal, announced last August, committed California and Google to each put tens of millions of dollars into a fund to be distributed to local news outlets over five years. In exchange, lawmakers scrapped two ambitious proposals that sought to force the search engine behemoth and its tech counterparts to pay outlets for using their published content.
But Gov. Gavin Newsom on Wednesday proposed to slash the state’s initial commitment to the journalism fund by two-thirds. 
Department of Finance spokesperson H.D. Palmer wrote in an email that the administration is seeking to reduce the state’s first-year payment of $30 million to $10 million solely because of “fewer resources than projected in the January budget.” The cut is part of Newsom’s May budget proposal, in which he’s seeking to close an estimated $12 billion shortfall for the 2025-2026 fiscal year that begins in July. 
The proposal to reduce the state’s share of the funding outraged local news advocates and proponents of requiring tech platforms to pay journalism outlets for their content — who already called last year’s deal insufficient. It raises questions about Google’s commitment to paying its share of the matching funds, and the overall status of the agreement which was announced in August but appears to have made little progress toward becoming reality. 
There were no signed term sheets in Google’s handshake deal with the state and with lawmakers last year — only public promises. 
“It’s extremely disappointing,” said Steven Waldman, president of the journalism advocacy group Rebuild Local News. “It was already too small and they’ve walked in the wrong direction from it at a time when the collapse of community news in California continues … Pink slime and rumor and misinformation is flooding into the vacuum so time is of the essence to try to turn this around. Instead, the effort is shrinking.”
A draft of the deal released last year suggested UC Berkeley would administer the funding program; the university has since declined to do so and the state has not announced a new administrator. As a result, Google also does not appear to have made its first-year payment of $15 million toward the fund, Waldman said.
The deal did not include strict timelines, but proponents said they aimed to “front-load” much of the money in the first year, which they believed could garner more private contributions along the way.
Deal struck after millions in lobbying from Google
Neither Newsom’s office nor Google responded to inquiries. The Computer and Communications Industry Association, a lobbying group that last year was largely bankrolled by Google to oppose the news bills, declined to comment. Google’s payments to influence state lawmakers surged to almost $11 million from July through September last year when the bills were under consideration – 90 times more than it has ever spent on lobbying in California over the same period of time.
A spokesperson for Assemblymember Buffy Wicks, who negotiated the deal last year in exchange for abandoning her bill that would have required platforms such as Google and Meta to either pay a fee or negotiate with news outlets for using their news content, said there would be “more information to share on this in the coming days.”
Wicks, in a statement, did not address the proposal to cut state funding. Instead the Oakland Democrat thanked Newsom for “for making an essential public investment that strengthens journalism” and described the funding as a “down payment, combined with those of private and philanthropic partners.”
After the first-year payments, Google and the state both were to put $10 million a year into the fund for four more years. 
The company also agreed to continue paying $10 million a year in existing grants to newsrooms — money it had threatened to withhold if the legislation passed. And it planned to put $17.5 million into an unspecified artificial intelligence program that had given some journalists and their union representatives anxiety over job losses. 
Now, Waldman is worried the state’s reduction in funding could prompt the company to do the same. As part of the deal, Google specified it would only pay into the journalism fund as a match to state dollars, said former Sen. Steve Glazer, the author of the other bill that was scrapped.
“They did not want a precedent to be set in California that could be easily replicated in other states, so they insisted upon a state match,” he said. “The fact that the governor is proposing to renege on (part of the deal) is a cherry on top for Google and it allows them to reduce their contribution if they desire.”
Glazer’s bill would have imposed a fee on major tech platforms to provide news outlets a tax credit to employ local journalists. The measure, legislative staff estimated, would have raised $500 million a year. Wick’s bill requiring the platforms to negotiate payments to news outlets was modeled on similar programs in Canada and Australia, but the political headwinds were tough in the tech companies’ home state. 
Lawmakers pursued both proposals to try to stem the decline of the news industry in California.  
Following a nationwide trend, media companies have hemorrhaged jobs over the past two decades as advertisers fled print media for the internet and technological advancements reshaped how readers consume news. The state has lost one-third of its newspapers since 2005 in a trend experts say worsens civic engagement, polarization and misinformation.
To try to keep their readers, publications increasingly rely on social media and online search.

A new podcast episode revisits CalMatters’ recent story on police stepping back from mental health calls, and what that shift means for crisis response systems.


“Mental illness is not a crime” has become a rallying cry for improving the treatment of people in crisis. As the health care podcast Tradeoffs explained last year in its special three-part series “The Fifth Branch,” more than 100 communities across the U.S. now send mental health experts instead of armed police to certain 911 calls. 
Now, a handful of sheriff’s departments in California have started refusing to respond to some 911 calls that involve mental health issues. The most prominent official involved is Sacramento Sheriff Jim Cooper, who announced in February that, going forward, his deputies would only respond to mental health calls if a crime had been committed or was in process, or if someone other than the person in crisis was in imminent danger.
 
 

“We wear the badge, we carry the gun,” Cooper said at his press conference announcing the new policy. “We deal with crime, not mental health crises.”
Veteran journalist Lee Romney has covered mental health issues in California for nearly 25 years and witnessed the growing consensus that police should be less involved in mental health crises. Lee was shocked by Cooper’s announcement.
“It seemed like he was throwing the baby out with the bathwater,” Lee told Tradeoffs. “Law enforcement is recognizing that things go better for them when they collaborate with clinicians, with paramedics. I think he’s just taken it a step beyond.”
Lee wrote about the new policy for CalMatters. She talked with Cooper and other law enforcement leaders, along with family members of people with severe mental illness.
You can listen to the full conversation with Lee below or read the transcript on Tradeoffs. It includes the powerful story of a scared mother who felt abandoned when her teenage daughter was in crisis and Sacramento deputies refused to respond.
Here are a few takeaways from Tradeoffs’ conversation with Lee:

Lee says Sheriff Cooper’s decision to pull back on mental health calls was motivated in part by concerns over legal liability. Cooper has cited a recent federal court ruling that held two Las Vegas police officers liable for killing a mentally ill man in 2019. But other legal experts say Cooper’s concern is misplaced. They say cops still have legal protections when answering mental health calls.
At least a handful of sheriff’s departments are following Sacramento’s lead. “I think that they are trying to make a point,” Lee said of these departments. “They’re trying to force a broader conversation and say, ‘Hey, it’s not our job to fix the mental health crisis problem.’ ”
Critics — including lawmakers, firefighters and community members — worry Cooper’s policy will put civilians and first responders at risk. But Lee says some mental health advocates are cheering the move. Cooper’s decision, they say, has pushed Sacramento to increase its efforts to come up with better ways to respond to mental health crises without sending the police.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/022822-Sacramento-County-Sheriff-AP-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-16 09:07:37.508601

NEW ORLEANS – With Kendrick Lamar’s “Not Like Us” as a soundtrack, nurses at University Medical Center walked off the job for the third time, picketing along the city’s Canal Street thoroughfare earlier this month.
“We will picket, shout, bargain, petition and strike again, and again, and again until the nurses win the first contract!” Terry Mogilles, an orthopedic trauma clinic nurse, told a rapt crowd on May 1. The crowd comprised about 100 nurses and their supporters, with many of the nurses wearing scrubs or red shirts with white lettering reading “We Will Strike for Our Patients!”
Mogilles and roughly 600 University Medical Center nurses voted to unionize with National Nurses United in December 2023. They are in their 16th month of union representation but say their employer is stalling on a contract that would actually improve their jobs.
Observers say nurses may be waiting even longer. On average, health care unions go around 17 months before obtaining first contracts. Today, the nurses not only have to overcome their employer’s resistance, but the downstream effects of the Trump administration’s policy changes, too.
In November, University Medical Center Management Corporation, filed a complaintwith the National Labor Relations Board, blaming the union for delays in negotiations. Workers say it is UMC that is delaying, and LCMC, the parent corporation for UMC and one of only two hospital administrators in the city, declined Capital & Main’s request for comment.

Nurses at University Medical Center are running up against a systemic flaw facing most newly organized workers — made worse by the current presidential administration, said Margaret Poydock, senior policy analyst at the Economic Policy Institute.
While the National Labor Relations Act mandates that employers must “bargain in good faith,” the law does not enforce a timeline on negotiations; more than half of all newly organized unions take over a year to get a contract, and the average as of 2022 was 465 days. There’s also a built-in incentive for anti-union employers to delay first contracts: One year after workers win union recognition, they can vote to dissolve their union. A long delay can enable employers to restart union-busting efforts.
“There are not really legal penalties,” said Poydock, because the National Labor Relations Board cannot fine employers for prolonging negotiations. Furthermore, said Poydock, in the case of unions who believe that their employer is not bargaining in good faith, “The only legal recourse workers have is through the board.”
However, the Trump administration has thrown the National Labor Relations Board into turmoil. One week after his inauguration, Trump fired the Joe Biden-appointed NLRB chair, Gwynne Wilcox, leaving the five-member board with just two members. The agency cannot issue decisions without a quorum of three members, giving reluctant employers even less incentive to bargain in good faith, knowing cases brought against them can be prolonged.
While Wilcox has sued for reinstatement, the case has bounced between judges and is still in litigation. If Wilcox loses her case, the board may remain without a quorum; if Wilcox wins reinstatement, Trump can appoint two more members to the board, creating a conservative majority. “That might make workers more hesitant to bring cases to the board, because they potentially will not have a ruling that favors them,” said Poydock.
President Trump also signed an executive order gutting the Federal Mediation & Conciliation Service (FMCS), cutting its staff from 220 to about a dozen and “eliminating [the FMCS and six other agencies] to the minimum presence and functionrequired by law.” The service helped workers and companies reach contract agreements. Though National Nurses United did not comment on whether it planned to seek FMCS involvement, without protections from the National Labor Relations Board or support from FMCS, unions like the one at University Medical Center have fewer options — outside of strikes — to force their employers to negotiate with them.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
New Orleans nurses say they walked out because workplace conditions have failed to improve.
The union has struck twice before, in October 2024 and February. Both times, management locked them out, costing LCMC a reported $2 million per day, or a total of $16 million.
In the months since, nurses say workplace violence has continued, pay is not sufficient, and University Medical Center has moved too slowly on contract negotiations.
“We had a number of nurses that were hurt on the job by patients; the potential for danger went up instead of going down,” said Mogilles. Nurses also say there have been several instances in which guns have been found in the hospital, and that chronic understaffing has continued, endangering patients and nurses alike.
Negotiations over pay have also contributed to the strike. Nurses say University Medical Center officials took eight months to respond to a seven-page wage proposal nurses had submitted last July. The hospital response, they say, was one paragraph long.
Umer Mukhtar, an ICU nurse and bargaining team member, said that the hospital’s delayed response “was a very strong motivation for us to come out and picket again.”
Mukhtar said retention at the hospital is poor, noting that eight nurses left his ICU in the past month.
“They [LCMC Health] want to keep [telling] lies while they buy time to union-bust and hopefully — for them — decertify the union,” he said. “They’re trying to make [the majority of nurses think that] the union is not an effective bargaining tool.”
On Canal Street’s rain-washed stage, Mogilles earned riotous applause as she closed out her speech. “Asking politely does not work!,” she said. “LCMC, you not like us! And we’re so glad we not like you.”

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)Permitting reviews for major mining projects may take years to complete, usually gathering input from the community and vital information on the natural and cultural characteristics of the sites. However, the Trump administration announced on Monday that, under newly established emergency procedures, a uranium mining project in Utah would have a completion timeline of just 14 days. 
After a portion of it was already mined, the Velvet-Wood mine located in San Juan County is set to be reopened by Anfield Energy, a Canadian energy development company, according to an economic analysis of the project. The project is expected to yield significant results, since the Velvet mine has already produced 400,000 tons of ore containing 4.2 million pounds of uranium, often used as fuel at nuclear power plants, and 4.8 million pounds of vanadium, which is used in steel production and energy storage. 
But, environmental advocates worry that accelerating the approval process for this project would set a dangerous precedent for the country and may cause harm to the already scarce water resources in the area.

“These processes, which are enshrined under one of our bedrock environmental laws, the National Environmental Policy Act, are really fundamental to being able to do an objective, well-thought out assessment of what the potential harms of a project like this might be,” Lexi Tuddenham, executive director of the environmental nonprofit HEAL Utah, said. “And they also, under the normal process, give the opportunity for public comment.”
The project sits in a Utah area that has seen the boom and bust of uranium mining over time, leaving abandoned mines without any cleanup plans, Tuddenham said. It is also near the Navajo Nation, which has been affected by uranium mining and processing throughout history. In such a rushed process, it would be extremely difficult to consider public comments from tribes.



Let us know what you think...


 


By shortening the process to just two weeks, there’s essentially not an opportunity for the people who may know the landscape best to provide important information on the site’s characteristics.
“One of the things being said about this mine is that it would only require about three acres of surface disturbance, but that’s not accounting for the underground disturbance that happens as part of the mining process,” Tuddenham said. “There’s really complex hydrology, like aquifers and just different water tables throughout our landscape, and when you mine into them, sometimes you permanently alter them.”
An energy emergency order
When the U.S. Department of the Interior announced the permitting review would be expedited to 14 days, it cited the national energy emergency declared by President Donald Trump on his first day in office. 
“America is facing an alarming energy emergency because of the prior administration’s Climate Extremist policies. President Trump and his administration are responding with speed and strength to solve this crisis,” Doug Burgum, secretary of the Interior, said in a statement in a news release. “The expedited mining project review represents exactly the kind of decisive action we need to secure our energy future.”  
The department added in the release that the U.S. “is dangerously reliant on foreign imports to meet its demand” to fuel nuclear reactors.
However, at the same time, a court battle is ongoing over the Trump order that allowed the process to be fast-tracked. Fifteen blue states are suing the federal government for issuing an energy emergency declaration without an actual emergency. 
“The Executive Order is unlawful, and its commands that federal agencies disregard the law and in many cases their own regulations to fast-track extensive categories of activities will result in damage to waters, wetlands, critical habitat, historic and cultural resources, endangered species, and the people and wildlife that rely on these precious resources,” attorneys general for the states wrote in the suit.
While Tuddenham believes there may be ways to make it easier for the public to engage in the process, expediting the years-long timelines, making substantial mistakes at the beginning of the permitting analysis would make wait times even longer and put a bigger burden on taxpayers.
“If you really skip around and skip around this bedrock environmental law and try to basically do it wrong, you’re, quite frankly, opening yourself up to a lot more litigation and red tape,” she said. “So going faster at the start doesn’t mean going faster overall. It’s sort of a performative thing.”

A bill that would have changed the governance of the department did not pass before the Legislature adjourned on Wednesday. (Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)A bill that would have subjected the Alabama Department of Archives and History’s Board of Trustees to political appointments failed to become law in another legislative session.
SB 5, sponsored by Sen. Chris Elliot, R-Josephine, would have taken the board’s power to nominate its own members and made the governor the appointing authority for most seats, including members from each congressional district. Eight at-large appointments would havecome from the House Speaker, Senate President Pro Tempore, and the House and Senate Minority Leaders.
This year’s effort was the furthest his bill has moved. Elliott said that he planned on bringing it back next year.
“I think at the end, everybody was on the same page … just ran out of time. It happens,” Elliot said after the Senate adjourned its final day Wednesday, adding that “it’s certainly a starting point for next year, and we’ll come back with it.”
Elliott has pushed for similar legislation since a presentation about LGBTQ+ history in Alabama at Archives in June 2023 led to attacks from Republicans and right-wing groups.Elliott tried to pull $5 million from the department in a special session on redistricting in the summer of 2023, but the bill failed to pass.
The following year, Ellitt filed a  bill that would have allowed state officials and legislative leaders to handpick the board members, keeping the board’s size as it was. That bill made it through the Senate and a House committee, but it never got to a vote in the full House.
The bill this year faced some delay after it returned to the upper chamber after the House added an amendment to remove the Senate confirmation process from appointments by the Speaker of the House.
Sen. Robert Stewart, D-Selma, asked Elliot how he felt about eliminating the Senate confirmation process, saying that this would make the Department of Archives and History one of the few agencies not subject to Senate oversight via confirmations.
Elliot, ignoring the debate while using his phone on the podium, did not look up.
“Well, I guess it’s not his pleasure,” Stewart said.
Elliot asked the Senate to adopt the House amendment, which would have sent the bill to the governor, but Senate Democrats continued to filibuster, effectively delaying and later killing some local bills. Elliott eventually changed his mind and asked the Senate to nonconcur, sending the bill to negotiations between the House and Senate through a conference committee.
The conference committee met shortly before the Senate convened Wednesday and removed the amendment added in the House, bringing the bill back to the Senate version. But amid a filibuster from Senate Democrats, neither chamber took up the conference committee report before the Legislature adjourned for the year.

Archives meeting

Archives’ board of trustees met on Wednesday afternoon.
“Whatever happens, we are very committed to working with the new appointments to be sure that we continue to serve the state well, and that there may well be some benefits of having those kinds of direct connections with the President Pro Tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House through their respective appointments,” Steve Murray, the director of Archives and History, said.
He then expressed gratitude to the members who would have been replaced under the legislation.
“I also want to thank the staff who have maintained really an unbreakable spirit of service and continuity in our work,” he said. “It has not been an easy couple of years for us here, but they remain absolutely committed to the work that we are doing, and do it with such energy and knowledge, and enthusiasm, and professionalism, that I could not be prouder to be affiliated with them.”
After the 90-minute meeting, Delores R. Boyd, chair of the Board for Archives said the changes that was under consideration by the Legislature were unnecessary.
“The governance structure that has worked for years was adequate,” Boyd said. “I respect the judgement of the politicians who believe that ought to have more impact. I hope that their motivation though, is one that is destined to keep this important agency on the same trajectory, that is: we are the crown jewel of state archival and history agencies. We have functioned well for over a century.”

(Photo: Richard Bednarski/Nevada Current)Nevada Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager is proposing the state tap into the Rainy Day Fund to provide additional pay for public school district teachers in hard-to-fill positions, citing the success similar funding provided two years ago had on the Clark County School District.
The Las Vegas Democrat is also proposing a mechanism to provide charter schools with dedicated funding for broader teacher and support staff raises, making good on a commitment to try and extend to them what they were denied by the Legislature two years ago.
The policy proposal to provide an additional $5,000 per year in pay for district teachers at low-income schools and in critical areas was well received by the Assembly Ways and Means Committee during a hearing Thursday. As was the proposal to establish a mechanism for broader teacher and support staff raises at charter schools.
But the proposed funding mechanism included within the bill — taking $90 million out of the state’s fully funded $1.3 billion Rainy Day Fund — may be a sticking point.
Yeager acknowledged it’s “a serious request” that will raise concern and discontent.
“I do think it’s accurate to say that it is already rainy and has been raining when it comes to filling hard-to-fill positions,” he continued. “If we’re being honest with ourselves, things are only likely to get worse when it comes to education and education funding given what’s happening at the federal level at the moment. So, I believe this is a good use of the funds.”
Democratic Assemblymember Daniele Monroe-Moreno, who chairs the Ways and Means Committee, in the meeting said she was “not in agreement” with the funding component of Yeager’s bill but said she would work to find an appropriate source of funding.
“I don’t think we have an answer for that today,” she added.
Monroe-Moreno, who is also chair of the Nevada State Democratic Party, did not elaborate, but Democrats this entire legislative session have warned that an economic downturn and budget cuts at the federal level may force the state to tap the Rainy Day Fund in order to maintain important services.
Yeager’s proposal, Assembly Bill 398, would provide up to $90 million in differential pay across two years for public school district teachers in positions deemed hard to fill. To qualify for the differential pay, teachers would have to work at a Title-1 school with a high vacancy rate, defined as 10% at the elementary level, 12% at the middle school level, and 15% at the high school level. Or they would have to work in an area that has been deemed to have a “critical labor shortage” — English language arts, math, science, or special education.
The Clark County Education Association and CCSD dedicated similar differential pay using an infusion of funding approved by the 2023 Legislature. According to Clark County Education Association Executive Director John Vellardita, who presented the bill alongside Yeager, the results were a resounding success.
Vellardita said Title-1 schools that qualified for the differential pay in 2023 saw a 53% reduction in vacancies, from 1,346 vacancies in May 2024 to 633 in January 2025. Special education positions saw an 84% reduction, from 310 vacancies in August 2024 to 50 in March 2025.
That progress toward getting a qualified teacher in every classroom needs sustained investments, he added. “It has made a difference. We’re asking for this to continue.”
CCEA Vice President Matt Nighswonger said during support testimony that the additional funding helps with teacher retention by incentivizing them to stay in positions that need the most experienced teachers.
“Teachers often view these positions as a stepping stone to a different school or a one-year teaching assignment to demonstrate they are a quality teacher,” he said. “Once they have demonstrated their prowess, they move on to a school in the suburban ring or to subjects that are not as demanding to teach.”
AB398 funding for educators would be available for all 17 Nevada school districts. But Yeager acknowledged that charter school teachers and education support professionals at both charter and district schools would not be eligible for the hard-to-fill position pay.
“Were our financial situation better, I might have made a different decision,” he said. “A future legislature can always decide to include them, but I didn’t believe it would be fiscally responsible for me to include them now. I don’t want to spread the funding too thin so that it doesn’t work and achieve the objective of actually filling these hard-to-fill positions.”
The Nevada State Education Association, whose affiliate units include teachers in non-Clark counties and support staff in CCSD, opposes the bill on the grounds it excludes education support personnel who are just as hands-on and vital to student success. Teamsters Local 14, which represents bus drivers and some other support staff within CCSD, similarly opposed the bill.
The Charter School Association of Nevada, Nevada Association of School Boards and Nevada Association of School Superintendents, as well as Clark and Washoe school districts, support the legislation.
Support from the charter school community was due to a conceptual amendment establishing a statewide fund that charter schools could tap to help with raises for their teachers and support staff. Yeager said the idea is to create a system similar to 2023’s Senate Bill 231, which provided $250 million in funding for teachers and support staff at public school districts.
The budget committee last week approved an education budget that makes permanent those SB231 raises.
Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo’s recommended budget had charter school raises being similarly baked into the education budget, but Democrats rejected that recommendation, saying charter school raises needed to be handled separately. That prompted Lombardo to publicly threaten to veto the education budget.
“I’ve been clear and consistent on this,” Lombardo said in a statement issued last week. “I will not sign an education budget that does not include equal pay for public charter school teachers and make teacher pay raises, including those for charter school teachers, permanent.”
Yeager’s AB398  provides a possible solution to charter school raises. Charter schools, likely collectively through their authorizing agency, the Nevada State Public Charter School Authority, would have to request the funds from the Interim Finance Committee, which makes financial decisions when the legislature is not in session. The schools would also have to match the funding, a requirement of 2023’s SB 231.
The governor’s office did not respond to the Nevada Current’s request for comment on Yeager’s proposal and whether it satisfies his requirement for equal pay for charter school teachers.
The current legislative session must end on June 2, leaving less than three weeks for lawmakers to pass a balanced budget that the governor will sign. In 2023, legislators failed to do so, which forced a 1-day special session.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/SteveYeager-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-05-16 08:03:48.435728

The move came eight days after the Alaska House of Representatives voted unanimously to approve a resolution that asks the administration to resume evacuation flights from that country. The state Senate is considering that resolution as well.
House Joint Resolution 13, from Rep. Will Stapp, R-Fairbanks, asks federal officials “to resume processing stalled applications by Afghan allies” and to reinstate evacuation flights “for applicants with approved special immigrant visas and their families, including efforts to overcome logistical barriers and diplomatic negotiations.”
The resolution doesn’t address the Trump administration’s actions; the resolution was developed before those were announced.  
Speaking on the House floor, Stapp said he served two tours of duty in the Iraq War and saw the bravery of local interpreters and police officers who worked with members of the American military despite threats to their lives.
“This resolution requests that our federal partners expedite special immigration visas so that we can look to bring as many of those people who stood shoulder to shoulder with us during our time at war to the United States so we can fulfill the promises that we made to them before they too suffer the same fate … that so many have already suffered,” he said.
HJR 13 is in the Senate State Affairs Committee and becomes final only if approved by the Senate and the House.

Twenty Black families from South Carolina filed a lawsuit, Briggs v. Elliott, the first direct attack on the validity of the “separate but equal” doctrine in public schools. 
The litigation was later combined with the successful Brown v. Board of Education case. The litigation might never have happened if not for the Rev. Joseph A. DeLaine, who accepted the NAACP’s call to challenge the school bus transportation practices in Clarendon County, where Black students had to walk up to 8 miles to school. 
“I realize that the stand that I take may cost me my job as a school teacher, but we need men,” he wrote. 
Property owner Levi Pearson had previously sued, asking that school buses be provided for Black students. After his lawsuit failed on technical grounds, Thurgood Marshall approached DeLaine, saying he needed families for litigation, or the NAACP couldn’t go any further. 
After gathering the signatures of 107 parents and their children, economic pressure and violence followed. Despite this, 17 adults signed the petition again, and the lawsuit moved forward to trial. Evidence showed that South Carolina spent $221 annually for each white student, but only $45 for each Black student. White children had modern schools with a teacher for every grade. Meanwhile, Black children studied in wooden shacks, reading textbooks discarded by white students. 
As a result of their activism, the Pearson family saw boycotts of their timber, and the Briggses were fired from their jobs. So were DeLaine and his wife. They saw their home and church burned to the ground. They were forced to leave the state after a drive-by shooting. In 2003, the families of DeLaine, Levi Pearson and the Briggses received Congressional Gold Medals for their courage.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/05164014/May16-master-pnp-ppmsca-71200-71200u.jpg,,,2025-05-16 09:07:37.508601

DeLaine, who accepted the NAACP’s call to challenge the school bus transportation practices in Clarendon County, where Black students had to walk up to 8 miles to school. 
“I realize that the stand that I take may cost me my job as a school teacher, but we need men,” he wrote. 
Property owner Levi Pearson had previously sued, asking that school buses be provided for Black students. After his lawsuit failed on technical grounds, Thurgood Marshall approached DeLaine, saying he needed families for litigation, or the NAACP couldn’t go any further. 
After gathering the signatures of 107 parents and their children, economic pressure and violence followed. Despite this, 17 adults signed the petition again, and the lawsuit moved forward to trial. Evidence showed that South Carolina spent $221 annually for each white student, but only $45 for each Black student. White children had modern schools with a teacher for every grade. Meanwhile, Black children studied in wooden shacks, reading textbooks discarded by white students. 
As a result of their activism, the Pearson family saw boycotts of their timber, and the Briggses were fired from their jobs. So were DeLaine and his wife. They saw their home and church burned to the ground. They were forced to leave the state after a drive-by shooting. In 2003, the families of DeLaine, Levi Pearson and the Briggses received Congressional Gold Medals for their courage.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/05164014/May16-master-pnp-ppmsca-71200-71200u.jpg,,,2025-05-16 11:10:49.504041

Birmingham officials have filed a lawsuit against a new state law that would reduce the number of appointments from the city to the Birmingham Water Works Board. (John Coletti/The Image Bank)The Alabama Legislature’s 2025 session is over, and the lawsuits have begun.
After state lawmakers passed a bill reducing Birmingham’s appointments to the Birmingham Water Works Board (BWWB), Birmingham officials filed a federal lawsuit to try to protect their controlling interest in the utility.
The city government currently appoints six of the nine directors on the board; SB 330, sponsored by Sen. Dan Roberts, R-Mountain Brook, converts BWWB into a regional authority with seven members and a single appointment from the city.

A hearing on the lawsuit, filed before Gov. Kay Ivey signed the bill on May 7, was scheduled for Thursday but postponed. The law does not explicitly mention BWWB but its provisions reflect the make-up of the water utility. Currently, two directors are appointed by the mayor while the Birmingham City Council appoints four members.
A message was left with Gov. Kay Ivey’s office Thursday seeking comment.
Proponents of the legislation said it was necessary to impose changes. In the past, the water utility has been beset with issues with billing, oversight and concerns over public trust. Customers reported concerns with unread meters and inaccurate water bills.
Under Roberts’ bill, the governor, lieutenant governor and counties that own a major reservoir would each get an appointment. Birmingham’s mayor and the president of the Jefferson County Commission also get an appointment. The governor’s appointment must come from one of the counties served by the utility.
Another county located outside the area where the utility is based gets to also appoint a board member. The governing body of the municipality where the regional water utility is located appoints a director. Finally, that law states that a resident where the water utility is located may also be a member of the Board.
The remaining members are selected, respectively, by the Jefferson County Mayors Association, the Shelby County Commission and Blount County Commission.
The lawsuit alleges the bill the equal rights and due process protections in the U.S. and Alabama constitutions. The lawsuit says that lawmakers in the Legislature, most of whom are white, reduced the power of officials in Birmingham whose population is 67% Black and forms 41% of the utility’s customer base.
The lawsuit also notes that other areas with representation are mostly white. In Blount County, it says, only about 2% of the residents are Black, and in Walker County, only 6% are Black.
“SB330 violates the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution,” the lawsuit states.
Plaintiffs listed in the lawsuit also stated that the law violates their right to due process because any changes to the board require changes to the Certificate of Incorporation, which is not part of the legislation, that must be approved by Birmingham City Council. The law changes the Certificate of Incorporation by reducing the number of members that the city council may appoint, which members of the Council did not approve.

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Stacey Pape: Proposed federal budgets cuts put public libraries under threat.","Dear Editor,On behalf of the South Burlington Public Library board of trustees, we express our deep concern about proposed federal budget cuts that threaten the future of public libraries here in Vermont.In South Burlington, we have a beautiful, welcoming public library because of the tireless support of our citizens. The library prides itself on strengthening our community through abundant resources. For example, our residents have access to materials from libraries throughout the state and beyond through interlibrary loan. We also offer the ABLE library (audio, braille, large print and electronic books) at no cost to patrons of all ages who are blind, visually impaired or have reading disabilities.And residents only need a library card to find online instruction and information on a huge range of topics, like car repair, test prep, nutrition, coding, starting a business and how to talk to others who hold opposing viewpoints. These essential services support education, employment and community well-being. However, these services are now under threat. The president’s executive order issued on March 14 proposes drastic cuts to the Institute of Museum and Library Services, the agency that provides crucial federal funding for libraries across the country. If implemented, this order would cripple the ability of our library — and all of Vermont’s libraries — to serve our residents.The Vermont Department of Libraries stands to lose roughly one-third of its funding if these cuts are made. All but two full-time employees of the Vermont Department of Libraries receive federal funds for their salaries. Without qualified staff to run the programs, many resources, such as the ILL and ABLE, will be inaccessible. Support, training and certification from the VDOL for Vermont library staff may also disappear.These services enable South Burlington residents to access information and materials far beyond the reach of a single public library. ILL is the most effective and efficient use of federal funds because it extends lending possibilities.Without the statewide ABLE Library, the South Burlington Public Library cannot provide full library access to local residents with disabilities. And removing access to Gale Research may leave residents without these plentiful online resources, both during and after library hours.These losses to our state libraries are not inevitable. Please urge Vermont’s congressional delegation to reject any budget that includes cuts to IMLS or otherwise undermines the critical mission of our nation’s libraries.Keep up with the issues facing libraries at the American Library Association’s website and sign up for news updates at Every Library. Protecting federal library funding is not just a matter of budget priorities. It is a commitment to the democratic values of access, opportunity and knowledge for all.Thank you for supporting your local library.Sincerely,Stacey Pape, chair of the South Burlington Public Library board of trustees, On behalf of the South Burlington Public Library board of trusteesRead the story on VTDigger here:  Stacey Pape: Proposed federal budgets cuts put public libraries under threat.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Letters-to-the-editor_featured-image-25.png,,,2025-05-16 07:04:24.369482

Each tribe has their own history — their own story — and each has the right to pursue its own future.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Peter A. Thomas: An alternative perspective on the Vermont Abenaki.","This commentary is by Peter A. Thomas. He is a retired UVM research associate professor. The text is adapted from his presentation to an information program for Vermont legislators about the state-recognized Abenaki communities on April 4, 2025.In 1978, while directing the consulting archaeology program at UVM, I received a contract from the National Park Service to do an archaeological survey in the Missisquoi Wildlife Refuge in Swanton. Along the north bank of the river, where Robertson’s Lease of 1765 established seven Abenaki farmsteads, we recovered ceramic and stone artifacts for 1.5 miles, confirming that this same area had been a focus of Native settlement for several thousand years.This project began a quarter-century of dialogue with the Abenaki community at Missisquoi. I worked with them to address the reburial of human remains. Young members of the community worked alongside my field team in Highgate where we were excavating Native sites spanning thousands of years. Everyone I met was open, enthusiastic, respectful and proud to be engaged. They were certainly not self-obsessed and self-serving “wannabes.” These folks directed their efforts towards the welfare of their family, extended families and community.The emergence and revitalization of the Missisquoi and other Abenaki bands in Vermont that I had observed was not unique. This upwelling of tribal activity was sparked by the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s and ‘70s in which marginalized and disadvantaged communities throughout the country stood up and demanded recognition, respect and civil justice.READ MORE
The Narraganset, Mohegan, Pequot, Mashpee, Nipmuc and Stockbridge also made their presence known at this time. Some received federal recognition; others did not. They are all still here. In 2012, I was asked by the Vermont Commission on Native American Affairs to review the documentation which the Abenaki Nation at Missisquoi, St. Francis/Sokoki Band had submitted with its request for state recognition. Contrary to recent accusations in the press, I was not paid to do so.Criterion 6 of the Legislature’s nine conditions for state recognition asked how the tribe would “address the social, economic, political or cultural needs of its members with ongoing educational programs and activities.” The listed accomplishments demonstrated the enormous commitment of time and initiatives of the Abenaki Tribal Council, Abenaki Self-Help Association and the Abenaki community at large to improve the condition of its people.In 1976 there were enormous obstacles to community betterment. According to documents submitted as part of the recognition process by the Missisquoi, in 1976 nearly 40% of the Missisquoi families had no income from employment; 66% of the heads of households had neither a high school diploma nor GED; health and housing conditions were alarming. These challenges were met by developing an affordable housing project, expanding basic literacy, and preventing school dropouts.Also from the documents the Missisquoi submitted: Looking back some 35 years, the Abenaki drop-out rate at Missisquoi Valley Union High School was 70% with 50% leaving school before ninth grade. In 2012, the drop-out rate was 3% and conversational Abenaki was being taught at the local high school.In 1982, fewer than 5% of the Abenaki who graduated received any post-secondary education. By 2009, 40% of Abenaki high school graduates went on to college; several were pursuing advanced degrees. In 1980, the Federal Commissioner of Administration for Native Affairs identified the Abenaki Self Help Association as one of the 12 outstanding Native social service agencies in the country. This is not a record that any group of “pretendians” could have ever achieved.A parallel revival also seems to have occurred at Odanak. Gordon Day, when working for the Museum of Man in Canada to record Native Abenaki speakers, made these early observations in 1956:“Superficially this band appeared to be almost totally acculturated. Their houses and clothes were Euro-Canadian. They had had the attention of Christian missionaries for 300 years; They had not hunted and trapped for a living since about 1922; Certain elders did remember Abenaki traditions, which as children they had heard from grandparents who were born in the early 19th century … The one native trait which was apparent was the language, which was then spoken as the language of choice by about 60 of the elder generation. By 1968, Gordon could count only 22 Abenaki speakers.”Like all of the Vermont Abenaki tribes, Odanak worked to revitalize their history and Native culture. Each tribe has their own history — their own story — and each has the right to pursue its own future. I am deeply saddened by all the vitriolic clamor that has been going on in the press. Regardless of Odanak’s current agenda, when Missisquoi petitioned for state recognition in 2012, the Penobscot, Passamaquoddy, Narraganset, Wampanoag (Aquinnah), Mohegan and Haudenosaunee all sent letters of support. The refrain that I’ve heard from tribes across the U.S. — “We know who we are!” — should not be ignored. I thought that we as Vermonters were long past the days when our fourth-grade Vermont history books informed us that “Indians never lived in Vermont.” Do we want to be troubled again with such a stamp of ignorance and regressive policies? I, for one, vote no!Read the story on VTDigger here:  Peter A.

Bob Ferguson uses to sign bills. Companies and other interest groups are hoping he'll opt for red veto ink on a range of tax bills.

They’re all trying to convince Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson that there are problems with the tax bills on his desk, and they are suggesting vetoes as a fix. Not surprisingly, they say the provisions drawing their antipathy will cost them, and by extension their customers, more money.
Ferguson has received written requests from hundreds of people and groups hoping to influence him ahead of Tuesday, the deadline to make decisions on pending bills.
He can sign or veto them entirely. He could veto a part, then sign what’s left into law. If the governor fails to act on a bill by the deadline, it would become law without his signature.
Whether he’ll wield the veto pen with such force as to require summoning the Legislature into special session is unknown. Rejecting the entire operating budget certainly would.
Ferguson could be tactical and veto a prong in a tax bill that the next two-year budget is not dependent on, for example. Lawmakers could make any course corrections next session. 
“Each day, we make some decisions and delay others,” Ferguson said Wednesday. “Some are a little more complicated, so we’ll keep talking.”
Here’s a glance at some of the folks trying to bend Ferguson’s ear their way.
The big one
House Bill 2081 is the most far-reaching of tax bills pushed through by majority Democrats over Republican opposition. It’s got five parts that are projected to generate $2.1 billion in the next budget and $5.6 billion over four years.
It has an across-the-board boost in business taxes, temporary surcharge on high-grossing firms and higher tax rates on large financial institutions and computing giants.
A number of companies and organizations are pressing Ferguson to remove the three-year surcharge for companies grossing more than $250 million. Among them are the Washington Hospitality Association and Washington Food Industry Association, who say it will drive up costs of food sold in restaurants and by independent grocers.
The Associated General Contractors want the whole bill vetoed. In its letter, the organization said the business tax increase will result in higher bids, driving up the cost of housing, schools, roads, and bridges.
“This could lead to delayed or canceled projects, job losses, and ultimately reduced state revenues,” executives with the group wrote
Sales tax on services
Senate Bill 5814, the other major money-maker, is relied on to raise $1.1 billion for the next budget, mostly by applying the retail sales tax to more services, such as digital advertising and temporary staffing. 
A coalition of streaming services, including Netflix, Paramount+, Peacock, and the Walt Disney Co., argues the new ad tax will lead to higher costs for customers or fewer options if services leave the market. They also think it may be challenged in court.
“Singling out one segment of the ad economy for this kind of discriminatory treatment is the wrong way to address the state’s fiscal needs and would do far more harm than good,” the Streaming Innovation Alliance told the governor.
The American Staffing Association wants Ferguson to pull temporary staffing services from the bill. Nearly 266,000 residents were employed through temporary or contract positions in 2023, it said.
“A sales tax on staffing services effectively raises the cost of labor, which research shows will lead to reduced demand for temporary work,” wrote Toby Malara, the association’s vice president of government relations. 
There is also a provision to begin taxing certain products with nicotine, like Zyn pouches, on Jan. 1, 2026.
PMI US Corporate Services, better known as Philip Morris International, wants it removed. “This would be the highest tax rate on nicotine pouches in the nation, and more importantly, would tax nicotine pouches at a higher rate than combustible cigarettes,” the company noted in its letter.
Ending tax breaks
Senate Bill 5794 aims to bring in $148.5 million by getting rid of tax breaks enjoyed by around 4,000 taxpayers. Ferguson is hearing from those who don’t want to lose the perks.
Operators of self-service storage facilities are one group. They would begin to pay taxes on the renting or leasing of individual units. They contend it’s not legal and urge Ferguson to view such a tax with skepticism as he did the now-discarded wealth tax. They attached an analysis from attorney Philip Talmadge, a former state Supreme Court justice, to drive home their point.
“Self-storage is not a luxury — it is a lifeline for thousands of working- and middle-class Washingtonians. Taxing it under a constitutionally dubious statute will only raise costs and undermine the integrity of our state’s tax system, while inviting a lawsuit the State will struggle to defend,” wrote Lance Baker, president of the Washington Self Storage Association.  
Community banks are pleading to preserve a deduction for first mortgage interest income. Eliminating it will increase their taxes and they say those costs will get passed on.
“Your administration has consistently emphasized the urgent need to expand housing supply and make homeownership more accessible,” wrote Jolene Riggs, executive vice president and chief financial officer of Baker Boyer National Bank in Walla Walla. “This added expense will force lenders to increase interest rates and fees, or reduce lending, making homeownership less attainable for the very families you seek to support.”
Taxing Tesla
House Bill 2077 would begin taxing the sale of electric vehicle credits between automakers. This has been dubbed the “Tesla tax” because the firm led by Elon Musk is the only automaker with credits to sell in Washington. Tesla opposes it, saying it will slow Washington’s push to sell more electric vehicles.
“Governments don’t tax or penalize overcompliance because it’s contradictory to the stated program goals,” Tesla executive Noelani Derrickson wrote, adding “it sets up a bizarre and unprecedented taxing scheme.”
Ford Motor Co., Rivian Automotive, and the Alliance for Automotive Innovation also want brakes applied to the new tax, which is counted on to generate $54.5 million for the operating budget.
Road revenue
Senate Bill 5801 is the $3.2 billion transportation revenue package. The marquee item is a 6-cent increase in the state’s gas tax. There’s lots more in it, like a bump up in the cost of vehicle weight fees and fees for getting rid of old tires. 
Another component increases the state tax on diesel by 3 cents in July and another 3 cents in 2027. The Washington Trucking Association asked this to be crossed out.
Most requests concerning this bill were from opponents of a new 10% “luxury aircraft tax.” It would apply to non-commercial planes and be levied on the portion of the selling price above $500,000.
In a joint letter, the Washington State Aviation Alliance and seven other groups told Ferguson that assuming that “because aircraft are expensive and therefore ‘a luxury item’ reflects a grossly uninformed understanding” of how non-commercial aircraft are used in communities. 
They are “tools that provide essential services for people of ALL classes, not just the wealthy,” reads the April 28 letter.
Rhys Spoor, a pilot and president of the Stuart Island Airway Park Association in Friday Harbor, was more blunt in summing up his argument. 
“You already have enough in taxes and should be required as a public servant to live within a frugal budget, just like most of the rest of us have to do,” he wrote.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_0821-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-16 07:04:24.369482

(Getty Images)Members of the Commission for Higher Education met in Hammond on Thursday for several hours to detail new laws and review the changing landscape for higher education institutions, notably slimmed-down budgets, more state oversight and shifting criteria for certain scholarships. 
Like most portions of the two-year budget, state funding for higher education took a 5% hit in the final days, triggered by a grim forecast that predicted $2 billion less in revenues over the next biennium. 
Two scholarship programs stayed flat, which Brooke Kile described as a “huge win” for commissioners. Both the 21st Century Scholars program and the Frank O’Bannon Grants aim to make college more accessible for Hoosier students.

“It’s a win for higher education; it’s a win for Hoosier businesses that need talent,” said Kile, CHE’s senior associate commissioner for business solutions. 
However, unused dollars allocated to the Frank O’Bannon fund can now revert back to the general fund, a change from previous years. CHE will be permitted to transfer that money to other programs. 
“What we were spending was … $130 million a year out of a roughly $168 million appropriation. With this new ability that we received starting the next fiscal year, we are allowed to spend up to the full appropriation,” said Chris Lowery, the state’s commissioner for higher education. “That is significant, additional help for low-income students.”
In addition to the 5% reduction for some other scholarship programs, CHE’s budget line and individual allocations to each public institution were reduced along with restoration and rehabilitation funding. 
Also tucked into the budget was language abolishing the Governor’s Workforce Cabinet, an initiative touted by former Gov. Eric Holcomb. Instead, the higher education body will take up many of those duties and align the state’s educational goals with business needs.
 Other legislative impacts

Though the state’s educational institutions will be exempt from new contracting rules advanced as part of an accountability and transparency measure, CHE itself will have to operate under the requirements for documenting bids and federal funding. 
Under a separate law, CHE will also be required to submit a report examining the utilization of physical facilities at state educational institutions, including an analysis of classroom spaces, laboratories and more. 
One of the biggest changes to the operation of the state’s public institutions will be enhanced tenure reviews tied to “productivity.” Such scrutiny will include teaching loads, time spent on instruction and graduate student oversight, and the research produced by a faculty member. 
State law now requires that if these criteria are not met, the faculty member “shall” be placed on probation and could be dismissed. Additionally, professors must publicly post their syllabi. 
  A list of bills from the 2025 legislative session that impact the Commission for Higher Education. (Slide from May 15, 2025 presentation)
Schools will no longer be required to have diversity committees under Senate Enrolled Act 289, which also impacts certain scholarships geared toward supporting minority students. In an attempt to still reach those students, the legislation defined “underserved counties” to include Allen, Lake, Marion, St. Joseph and Vanderburgh. Certain students from those counties may still qualify for the minority scholarships. 
Another new higher education law will require several state agencies to collaborate and create a public dashboard detailing secondary programs, such as career and technical education and adult high schools. Such reports must include information related to participation, costs, completion and employment outcomes for students. 
As the author of Senate Enrolled Act 448, Terre Haute Republican Sen. Greg Goode highlighted the measure as one with bipartisan support during the 2025 session before the commission on Thursday. He described it as an effort to help universities focus on training the workforce for high-demand priorities such as life sciences, microelectronics, semiconductors and more. 
“This is a way to help encourage and inspire department chairs, from my perspective, to grow our enrollment,” said Goode, who previously worked at Indiana State University. 
The bill would also study whether the state should have minimum admission requirements for Hoosier students.
 


				Under state law, the commission must also publish its recommendations for tuition and fee increases across the schools it oversees within 30 days after the state budget is enacted. While CHE always recommends a 0% floor increase, the maximum hit a high of 4.7% in 2009 during the great recession.
Following the recommendation of Gov. Mike Braun, commissioners have opted to direct schools to keep tuition and fees flat for the next fiscal year. 
“I know that’s a real challenge for our institutions, and I’m very sensitive to that. But I think the most important thing is what we’ve been striving for through our whole agenda: increasing enrollment and getting more Hoosier students to go to college.”

But I think it’s a much larger discussion than one-time payments that won’t even cover the cost of diapers.
I must start this conversation by being clear that I have never given birth. I was lucky enough to find a man with an amazing daughter, and she welcomed me as a mother. Before I met her, I never had the maternal urge or instinct.
Rather than attacking women who have a different vision for their lives, I want to focus on how to support those who want to be parents — whether of one child or many siblings.
I have experience with both, in a way. My parents both came from large families: eight and 10 siblings. Our family gatherings are epic. But I only had one sibling, a brother I lost too soon.

The U.S. birth rate has been in decline since 2007. Other countries are seeing the same phenomenon. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tracks two birth rates: crude birth and fertility.
Crude is the number of children born per 1,000 people. The number is calculated by dividing births in a year by the average population for the year.
Fertility rates are calculated by the total number of births to women aged 15-44.
USA Today reported in January that the crude birth rate for the U.S. in 2023 was 10.74 births per 1,000 people. The fertility rate that same year was 54.5 births per 1,000 women aged 15-44, a slight drop compared to 2022’s rate of 56 births per 1,000 such women.
In comparison, the fertility rate was 69.5 in 2007.
Vice President J.D. Vance and others are concerned about the stability of the economy due to the falling birth rates. Labor shortages are a prime consideration, as well as reduced tax revenue to support public infrastructure and services.
While a lower population could reduce consumption to a point, a baseline of service will always be needed, some argue.
There does seem to be an increased focus on career than family in recent decades. But even those who want to have children find themselves putting it off because they simply can’t afford it. It’s that group of people that government could support, in order to encourage and incentivize births.
Solutions
Child care costs are the number one concern for most. At this point, a year of child care costs as much as college tuition.
Having a parent stay home is an option, but in the current economy it would be a struggle to keep up with a family’s needs on one salary. Here in Indiana, legislators reduced eligibility for a child care voucher and also have shown no interest in a child care tax credit. They have instead focused on child care regulations that might be limiting the number of seats available in the state. While helpful, it’s doubtful the tweaks will make a significant dent in the shortage.
Let’s also remember that child care also helps employers fill open jobs.
Indiana has had a prekindergarten program since 2015 but it serves only 6,000 children statewide — and funding has stagnated.
Prekindergarten not only helps parents struggling with care options but also gives children a solid foundation for school. A longitudinal Indiana study found positive effects as a general measure of school readiness and early language and literacy. Additionally, children who participated had significantly higher mathematics and meaningfully higher English language arts scores on Indiana’s statewide assessment in the third and fourth grades than the comparison students.
Then there’s the issue of paid maternal leave. Mandating coverage would go a long way to ensuring new mothers could bond with their children and come back to careers they value. More than a dozen states have paid leave laws but Indiana is not one of them.
Family-friendly quality of life measures are also important, including a variety of parks, trails, and affordable housing. No one wants to cram multiple children into a bedroom together, and current housing prices are helping dictate family decisions.
I think the billions being discussed on the federal level — and millions in state-level decisions — would be better used in a targeted manner to grow the infrastructure needed to have and nurture children. Let’s hope the discussion continues beyond one-time payments.

Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer.The recent double felony conviction of Minnesota painting contractor Fred Newell should send a clear message: Wage theft is a crime, and when workers come together through a union, justice is not just possible, it’s within reach.
Newell, owner of Integrated Painting Solutions, was entrusted with public funds for a publicly funded project. Instead of paying his workers what they were rightfully owed, he kept money for himself. He filed false payroll reports. He misclassified employees to skirt labor laws. He lied and told workers that prevailing wage standards didn’t apply to them. When workers spoke up, he said he’d pay them back. He never did.
Let’s be clear: this wasn’t a misunderstanding, it was intentional theft — plain and simple. And it’s far from an isolated incident.
As we know, where there’s smoke, there’s fire. This conviction could be a sign that wage theft is happening in our cities, on our job sites, and on the very projects meant to benefit our communities more than we think. 
As union members, we see wage theft for what it is: a systemic exploitation of working people, particularly those who are the most vulnerable — workers who can’t afford to lose a paycheck, workers who fear retaliation, and workers who are told to “take it or leave it.”
This is why unions like ours exist. We are the first line of defense. When a worker is being cheated, they can’t just call 911. But they can call a union, even if they’re not a member. And when they do, we don’t just listen — we take action.
Our union stood up for the workers who were denied fair pay. A felony conviction was secured — a rare and meaningful outcome in a system where wage theft is too often treated like a paperwork issue instead of the serious crime it is.
Newell will be sentenced on June 6 and could face up to a year in jail. He is also effectively barred from working on city of Minneapolis projects going forward. That matters. That’s accountability. And it wouldn’t have happened without union involvement.
For too long, wage theft cases were limited to slow-moving civil enforcement. That meant justice was delayed — and often denied. But now, thanks to partnerships between labor and forward-thinking prosecutors, these cases are being prioritized. Minnesota now has some of the toughest anti-wage theft laws in the country because our legislators understand that when wage theft is allowed to go unchecked, it sends the wrong message to bad actors: that cheating workers is just part of doing business.

It’s not. It’s a crime.
When unions are strong, wage theft doesn’t stand a chance. We don’t just protect our own members — we protect the standards for everyone. That’s why the work we do matters not just for unionized workers, but for non-union workers, too. When we raise the alarm, the whole industry hears it.
We’re proud of the bravery of the workers who spoke up and called us when they were being cheated. We’re also proud of the future partnerships we’ve built with the Minnesota Attorney General’s Office, the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office, and the Labor Council Advisory Committee.
But we also know this is just one case. 
Wage theft could be happening right now — today — on job sites across this state. It could be happening to workers without representation, without protections, and without a clear path to justice.
If you’re a worker experiencing wage theft, don’t wait. Don’t go it alone. Call a union. We are the first step, we are the frontline, and we are ready to fight for you.
Every worker deserves a paycheck they can count on and someone in their corner when that paycheck doesn’t come.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/P1105289-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-16 07:04:24.369482

There is a deep irony that the face of resistance against Ron DeSantis’ efforts to conceal and misrepresent Florida’s Black history has lived the very history that the governor and his arch-conservative/MAGA buddies are working so hard to erase.
Racism and discrimination are poisons that have infected every part of this country and all of its institutions, including the legal and criminal justice system, education and academia, the military, the media, and healthcare. Segregation, discrimination and legal and de facto separation of the races was never stamped out and is rearing its ugly head again thanks to arch-conservative elements seeking to return the state and the country to a time when Black people occupied a place several tiers below their white counterparts.
Although the governor is wont to sugarcoat the brutality of chattel slavery, Jim Crow, segregation, and the casual, ruthless treatment of African Americans in Florida, 84-year-old historian and scholar Dr. Marvin Dunn is living proof of the lies and emptiness of the DeSantis/MAGA narrative.
He and other Black people carry in their bones the wretched history that DeSantis and others so desperately want to hide.
‘I know Jim Crow’

“I knew Jim Crow. I grew up in Florida under his dark, suffocating wings. I knew him intimately, as did every Black person I knew growing up in Deland and Miami in the 1940s and 50s,” Dunn writes in his book, “A History of Florida: Through Black Eyes.”
“He hovered over every aspect of the first twenty-five years of my life, sucking ambition from me. I grew up during the last vestiges of his reign. I was so used to seeing the signs that read, “Whites seat from front – Colored seat from rear” on public buses that, when they were finally removed in the 1960s, sometimes I thought I still saw them there.
“Even after his death, Jim Crow was, for a while, omnipresent mentally and emotionally in our lives; such had been his reach. No black person I knew escaped the impact of the Jim Crow system or the possibility of being killed for no other reason than being black. A black person in Florida, during the time I grew up, lived with a pervasive awareness of the limitations a racist society imposed and of the impact those limitations imposed upon one’s life.”
With the passage of time, fading memories, and historical misinformation and disinformation, DeSantis and others seek to soften the violent, random, heartless system and spare the descendants of the perpetrators the pain of memory.
Against this background, Dunn’s is one voice standing up to the DeSantis political steamroller. He is a man whose actions are consistent with his values and beliefs. Dunn’s stories, books, lectures, and interviews serve as a poignant reminder of the power and potency of Black people.

Racial caste system
Dunn, 84, is countering the lies, hateful rhetoric, suppression of free speech and dissent, and efforts to intimidate critics and anyone standing up to DeSantis and the MAGA horde.
Dunn was born in DeLand and grew up in the segregated South to a family that endured the indignities of Jim Crow and struggled economically because of racism and segregation, not because they didn’t work damn hard.
Dunn says in his book that in June 1940, he was born in an orange grove barn in the Blackberry community of DeLand. Corinne Elizabeth Williams, his mother, was a housecleaner and cook, and his father, James C. Dunn Sr., was a fruit and vegetable picker. The family were migrants who harvested crops in DeLand and Hicksville on Long Island, N.Y., he recalled.
He vividly remembers that every aspect of Black life was suffocated by the rigid racial caste system that consigned African Americans to second- and third-class citizenship manifested in inferior living accommodations; the worst-paying jobs, and a joke of an educational system. Black schools were in deplorable condition, the books were hand-me-downs, and children often had to walk miles to school in all types of weather, often passing sturdy, well-constructed white schools on the way.
“For most blacks of my generation in Florida, and I suspect elsewhere, the inferiority of our blackness was instilled in us by the people who were closest to us, our parents and grandparents,” Dunn writes.
Disrespect
“Jim Crow ruled. We used the colored water fountain at the Volusia County Courthouse. The water was not chilled as it was in the white fountain. We used bathrooms in the basement that were marked for ‘colored.’ I noticed that when I went downtown with my mother to shop, whites had the privilege of skipping ahead of us. Essentially, in the South at that time, a white person was not expected to wait until a black person was served, which would have been an act of subservience, or at least, respect.”
Noted Civil Rights attorney Benjamin Crump captured Dunn’s life’s work.
“As Black history is scrubbed from classrooms, Dr. Marvin Dunn is planting truth — literally. Under a tree at FL Int’l Univ, he’s teaching the Rosewood massacre and handing out banned books. In a state erasing our past, Black educators are once again forced to be the curriculum,” Crump wrote.
Meanwhile, after being named chair of the FIU Psychology department, Dunn co-produced several video documentaries. His FIU archival collection now consists of more than 4,000 photographs and images reflecting the Florida Black experience.
As a historian specializing in Black Florida history and culture, Dunn is founder and president of the Miami Center for Racial Justice and is known for organizing the “Teach the Truth” tours, which highlight Florida’s history of racial violence. Center staff members take participants to historic sites related to the history of racial violence in the state.
Dunn’s books include his “History of Florida,” “Black Miami in the Twentieth Century,” and “The Miami Riot of 1980: Crossing the Bounds.” In July 2024, the center received a Mellon Foundation grant of $1.5 million to extend this work to Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi.
‘Insult to injury’
Except for an occasional phenomenon like Joe Louis, Jackie Robinson, or Gloria Lockerman, Dunn remembers, Black Floridians saw little that was worth emulating.
“Adding insult to injury, this was by design, and Florida itself was complicit in it by subjecting us to a segregated education system that intentionally depicted African Americans primarily as laborers,” he writes in his “History.”
“My education in Florida schools skipped over slavery with a few drawings of slaves picking cotton and appearing happy to be doing it. They had neat little cabins with little black children playing in the background. Florida was complicit because it imposed upon us a racist educational system that denied us our heroes, heroines and fighters. It was an effective, intentional and insipid way of milking ambition from generations of black Floridians,” Dunn writes in his “History.”
DeSantis’ Florida, and by extension about half of America, are places where one group of people believe they have the God-given right to alter the truth, expurgate historical facts, and suppress the racial violence, lynching, and destruction of Black communities in Ocooe and Rosewood in the early 20th Century. They’re intent on erasing the savagery and casual violence and diminishing the accomplishments Black Floridians wrote into history.
William DC Clark, a South Florida retired firefighter and paramedic, argues African Americans and their allies must fight like hell against this tyranny of the minority on all fronts.
“By now everyone knows that Trump (and DeSantis) are trying to erase any significant gains that Blacks have made. They’re trying to make it look like we didn’t even exist. Some say they’re trying to take us back to the day when we were considered 3/5ths of a man,” Clark, president of the DCS Mentoring Program in Miami, told me in a recent interview.

Passive no more
“But what gets me is, when most reporters report on the latest DEI snub or latest firing of a top-ranked Black person, they do so as if they were reporting on someone being given a ticket for jaywalking.
“Maybe they feel the same way as Trump. Maybe they’re so used to many of us being so passive that it’s normal to them. But this is anything but normal and contrary to their beliefs, some of us will die for our freedom. FAFO if you want to … .”
The days of Blacks only having the option of cleaning white people’s homes; being prohibited from entering through the front door; being forced to step off the sidewalk when white people approached; enduring busing to get an education; and keeping Blacks in line are dead.
Dunn and Clark are the tip of widespread resistance in Florida and elsewhere to the grotesque efforts by Ron DeSantis and the Republican-majority Legislature, GOP leaders, policymakers, and donors to drag the country back to Jim Crow.
DeSantis and his hobgoblins probably think they’ve won this battle because the opposition is afraid and confused, and too many have been cowed into silence. But all of us need to do as Clark and Dunn have done and continue to fight against the forces of ignorance by organizing, protesting, engaging in civil disobedience, and using the courts, literature, music, and theater arts. Because, despite what the MAGA crowd posits, African Americans are Americans too.

The U.S. Census Bureau released new July 2024 city population estimates Thursday.
In New York City, a recent city planning report suggested that “two consecutive years of growth suggest that pandemic-era losses were short-lived.” The city is still almost 328,000 short of its 2020 population, however.
Los Angeles returned to the list of top growth cities for the first time since 2016, according to the Census Bureau.

Are you a teacher, nurse or skilled trades worker looking to buy a house or condo in today’s market? We’d like to talk to you about the experience of trying to buy a home with a household income of around $75,000 a year — email Tim Henderson at thenderson@stateline.org.


The largest one-year population increases for mid-2023 to mid-2024 were New York City (87,184), Houston (43,217), Los Angeles (31,276), and the Texas cities of San Antonio (23,945) and Fort Worth (23,442). The same cities were in the top five the previous year, but the growth is a big turnaround from 2021-22, when New York City lost almost 100,000 people and Los Angeles gained only about 2,000.
A new interest in living in big cities could be impacting rents: Zillow reported this week that there now are eight cities, double the number from 2020, where renters need more than a $100,000 annual income to afford typical rent: New York City ($145,000 needed), San Jose, California ($137,000), Boston ($127,000), San Francisco ($124,000), San Diego ($123,000), Los Angeles ($119,000), Miami ($110,000) and Riverside, California ($103,000).
Homes for sale in the fastest-growing city areas also are getting further out of reach for even moderate-income buyers, according to a National Association of Realtors report also released Thursday. The New York City and Los Angeles areas were listed as “moving in the wrong direction” on affordability, “reflecting a growing divide between what homes actually cost and what local families can afford.”
For instance, even a Los Angeles-area family with a $200,000 income can afford less than a third of the homes listed for sale, including condominiums and townhouses, according to the report.
Houston, San Antonio and the Dallas-Fort Worth area were listed among three tiers as “stuck in the middle” of affordability, “showing signs of progress, yet still falling short of offering real affordability to most families.”
For the four years combined after the COVID-19 pandemic started in 2020, both New York City and Los Angeles have not completely recovered population. New York City is down almost 328,000 people and Los Angeles is still short about 21,000 since the 2020 census, but they remain the nation’s two largest cities.
The largest percentage growth since 2020 was in some fast-growing suburbs: Westlake, Florida, near Palm Beach, has grown to 7,664, more than eight times its 2020 population, and Josephine, Texas, near Dallas, has quadrupled in size to 8,807. Medicine Lake, Minnesota, west of Minneapolis, also quadrupled, to 1,343.

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)State budget negotiations were top of mind for lawmakers Thursday, even as the Senate took action on a variety of bills, with Senate Republicans calling for a meeting with Gov. Tony Evers and Democrats calling on Republicans to support Evers’ budget requests. 
The Wisconsin Legislature is in the process of writing the next biennial budget, and Republicans are intent on passing a tax cut this session after failing to get Evers’ approval for a proposed cut last session.
Republican leaders have said they want an agreement on the tax cut before allocating spending to other priorities, and are waiting for Evers to schedule an in-person meeting with them to work it out.
Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu (R-Oostburg) said during a press conference ahead of a Senate floor session Thursday that Evers’ office has had lawmakers’ plan for a tax cut since March and that they have asked Evers for a list of specific items that he would want in the budget to agree to cutting taxes. However, LeMahieu said they haven’t been given any details in the last several weeks.
“Speaker Vos and I provided the governor with a series of times [to meet] into next week as a last-ditch effort to preserve these good faith negotiations,” LeMahieu said. “I hope sincerely that he accepts… one of those dates next week. It’s imperative that we meet by the end of next week at the latest to stay on schedule to pass a budget by the end of the fiscal year. It’s as simple as that. Time’s ticking… and if we’re going to work to get a budget passed, we need to meet with the governor next week.”
LeMahieu said GOP tax goals include exempting income for retirees in Wisconsin to encourage them to stay in the state and increasing the second-tier tax bracket, similar to a bill the governor vetoed last session. LeMahieu said the new tax bracket won’t reach as high up the income ladder as the vetoed one.
Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) said on Tuesday that work on the budget is “on pause” until legislators get an in-person meeting with Evers and that their preferred option is “to be able to get an agreed upon tax cut so that we know we have X dollars to invest in schools and health care and all the other things that are important.” 
LeMahieu said that the latest Legislative Fiscal Bureau report would also be pivotal in negotiations because it will help lawmakers understand “what kind of tax cut we can afford” and “what kind of other investments we can afford.”
The Legislative Fiscal Bureau projected in the fiscal estimate released Thursday afternoon that the state will finish the 2023-25 fiscal year, which ends June 30, with a $4.3 billion budget surplus, which is slightly higher than the estimate from January. However, the estimate also found that tax collection will likely be lower over the next two years.
“While we are not surprised by these new estimates, we remain cautious as we work to craft a budget that invests in our priorities, funds our obligations, and puts the State of Wisconsin in a strong fiscal position for the future,” Joint Finance Committee Co-chairs Rep. Mark Born (R-Beaver Dam) and Sen. Howard Marklein (R-Spring Green) said in a statement. 
The lawmakers said that the estimates are a sign that they need to continue to approach the budget in the same way they have in the past. They also called on Evers to “take these revenue re-estimates seriously” and to “come to the table with legislative leaders and work with us to craft a reasonable budget that works for Wisconsin.” 
Democrats on the Joint Finance Committee said in a statement that the estimate is a sign of the decline the economy could face due to Trump administration tariffs. 
“Now, more than ever, Wisconsinites are struggling to put food on the table and maintain a roof over their heads. This projection shows it’s going to get even worse, especially when our communities start to feel the direct impact of the Trump regime’s trade war around the globe,” the lawmakers said. “Together, we need to ensure Wisconsinites have the resources to get through the chaos and uncertainty that lies ahead.” 
Ahead of the floor session, Democratic lawmakers called attention to Evers’ budget requests, saying that the various non-budget bills the Senate took up Thursday don’t address the issues that Wisconsinites are most concerned about. 
“It’s been 87 days since [Evers] has introduced his budget. It invests in essential priorities — K-12 funding, child care education, mental health, helping the environment and putting much needed funding in the university system. What have Republicans done in those 87 days? Well, they stripped essential items in that budget….” Senate Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein (D-Middleton) said at a press conference. “What the Legislature should do is debate the budget.”
Wisconsin Republicans on the Joint Finance Committee cut over 600 items from Evers’ proposal last week , saying they were taking the budget “back to base.” 
Sen. LaTonya Johnson (D-Milwaukee) noted that lawmakers recently traveled across the state to hear from Wisconsinites about their priorities for the state budget and then failed to act on any of those priorities. She then listed several bills on Thursday’s calendar. 
“We’ve got a bill on changing the name on the name-change process for people convicted of violent crimes; a bill that gives big businesses their own private courts; a bill tweaking surcharges for electric vehicles,” Johnson said. “I’m not saying that these bills aren’t important to someone, but we sure didn’t hear about these issues when we traveled across the state at our listening sessions.” 
Johnson said that lawmakers need to ask if the bills “meet the moment” the state is facing. 
“Do they lower the cost for hard-working families? Do they help us hire nurses, teachers, child care providers? Do they clean our water and keep our streets safe [or remediate] lead contaminated classrooms?” Johnson asked. “If the answer is no, then why the hell are we here?” 
Democrats, including Hesselbein, have said they think Democratic votes will be necessary to pass a budget, but they don’t necessarily expect to be in the room for budget negotiations between legislative Republicans and Evers.
Asked if Democrats are requesting to participate in a sit-down between Evers and Republicans, Hesselbein said she is “in consistent contact with Gov. Evers and his administration, and those conversations have been both before and moving forward.” 
Pressed on whether she wants to be in the room when the governor and Republicans meet, Hesselbein said “I’ll be honest, sometimes it’s hard to get all of us in the same room because of timing and schedules and things like that.”
Some of the bills that the Senate took action on Thursday include: 

SB 33, which would make it a crime to share nonconsensual “deep fake” nude images and was introduced in reaction to the growing use of artificial intelligence to make fake images. It passed unanimously. 
SB 125, which would require the Public Service Commission to conduct a study for a place to locate a nuclear power plant. It passed with bipartisan support from 28 Senators. Four Democrats and Sen. Steve Nass (R-Whitewater) voted against the bill. 
SB 96, which would exempt electric vehicle charging stations at a person’s home from the electric vehicle charging tax. It passed unanimously. 
SB 146, which would bar someone convicted of a violent crime including homicide, battery, kidnapping, stalking, human trafficking and sexual assault from changing their name, passed 18-15 in a party line vote.
The Senate also passed AB 73 in an 18-15 vote. The bill would create a specialized commercial court meant to handle business cases. It comes after the state Supreme Court discontinued a pilot program last year.

But without water, survival time drops to 3-7 days.  Clearly, if we don’t drink water, we quickly die from dehydration.  Given that the human body is 76% water, one might think as a society we would put the absolute highest priority on maintaining this most vitally necessary substance for our survival.  
Unfortunately, that is not the case on either the federal or state level as politicians pander to the never-ending demands to lower water quality standards to appease industries, municipalities, water utilities, and to muster support by claiming deregulation is “cutting red tape.”
The average American would be shocked to know what’s in their water — as well as what passes through both fresh and wastewater treatment plants. Nor are the effects of the growing multitude of pollutants a mystery.  Scientists and doctors know certain substances are extremely deleterious to human health. Yet, bowing to the pressures of commerce or cost, the current direction is to allow more, not less of these substances in our water.  
The most recent egregious example is the move by Lee Zeldin, now the head of Trump’s mis-named Environmental Protection Agency, to roll back the limits on PFAS, that were first adopted by Biden’s administration just last year.
PFAS are a group of widely-used substances which are known as “forever chemicals” because they are basically impossible to remove once they are in the human body or environment.  They are classified by the World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer as “carcinogenic to humans.” 
In March, only a month after being confirmed by the Senate, Zeldin claimed he was making “the largest deregulatory announcement in U.S. history” by redirecting the EPA to favor deregulation and energy production. He claims his rollback of PFAS standards in drinking water is introducing “common-sense flexibility” by kicking the compliance date out to 2031 and rescinding standards on three PFAS substances. But continuing to poison the population surely doesn’t make much common sense. 
While the deregulatory wrecking ball crashes into the federal water quality standards, Montana’s legislature and governor have similarly decided to turn our water quality regulations to a sort of mush by repealing “numerical standards” that measure the amount of pollutants actually in the water to “narrative standards.”  
As reported, narrative standards are described by the Department of Environmental Quality as “more general statements of unacceptable conditions in and on the water.”  To put it mildly, this change does not portend cleaner water for Montanans and is now the subject of a lawsuit by the Upper Missouri Waterkeeper group challenging the agency’s use of narrative standards in its refusal to list the Big Hole River as impaired due to nutrient pollution.
Despite being at the very headwaters of the nation’s mightiest rivers, studies in Montana’s major river valleys found an alarming number of chemical pollutants in our groundwater, domestic, and commercial wells.  The Helena Valley study, for instance, found “pharmaceutically active” compounds including antibiotics, hormones, and drugs as well as the herbicide atrazine in the groundwater/well samples…all of which affect both humans and aquatic life.  
Simply put, we’re heading in the wrong direction and fouling our own nest by moving to capitulate to commerce rather than regulating pollutants to protect the health of our citizens and environment.  We know the damage is being done.  And no amount of short-term profits can or ever will replace the most vitally necessary substance for life — good, clean water.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-1368715188-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-16 07:04:24.369482

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)A coalition of news organizations, including the Indiana Capital Chronicle, is asking a federal judge to block a state law barring press from witnessing state executions, arguing it violates the First Amendment. 
The Indiana Attorney General’s Office, in response to the preliminary injunction request, urged the court on Thursday to deny what state attorneys called a “last-minute” and legally baseless request.
The dispute centers on an Indiana law that limits attendance at executions to: the warden, a warden’s designated assistant, the prison physician, another physician, a spiritual advisor, a prison chaplain, five friends or relatives of the inmate and eight members of the victim’s family.
A Department of Correction (DOC) policy also says press “shall not be permitted to witness the execution.”
News reporters are granted access to a designated area outside of the Indiana State Prison but are not permitted to directly witness the state’s actions — unless invited by the condemned to fill one of the five spots.
Five media outlets filed the underlying lawsuit last week. Attorneys with the Reporters Committee for the Freedom of the Press are representing the news entities.










A lack of press access leaves the public with an incomplete understanding of the proceedings.


– complaint filed by five news entities, including the Indiana Capital Chronicle


A hearing before Judge Matthew Brookman is scheduled for Friday morning in Evansville, in Indiana’s southern district. It’s not clear if Brookman will make a decision at that hearing.
The state attempted to move the legal matter to the federal court in Indiana’s northern district, but that request was denied by the judge.
Court proceedings come just days before the scheduled execution of death row inmate Benjamin Ritchie at the Indiana State Prison in Michigan City. The prison warden said in a declaration filed Thursday that Ritchie has not requested media be permitted as one of his five witnesses.
The execution is set to take place before sunrise on Tuesday, May 20, and will be the second death sentence carried out in Indiana since the state resumed capital punishment last year. 
Before that, executions were on a hiatus for more than a decade.
Media organizations seek urgent intervention
Media organizations asked the federal court to intervene before Ritchie’s execution. They’re also seeking access to future executions until the broader legal challenge is resolved.
In a motion for a preliminary injunction filed Monday, the five media outlets — including the Capital Chronicle, The Associated Press, Gannett, Circle City Broadcasting and TEGNA — argued that Indiana Code and DOC policy violate their First Amendment rights by denying press access to executions.
The groups contends that journalists, as representatives of the public, are entitled to witness executions — a critical part of the criminal justice process.
Reporters from all five entities have covered portions of the case and The Associated Press regularly covers executions nationwide.
Indiana is one of 27 states with the death penalty, but one of only two states — along with Wyoming — that doesn’t include media witnesses at executions.
Senior Reporter Casey Smith witnessed December’s state execution of Joseph Corcoran — via the inmate’s guest list.

Plaintiffs argued that this restriction undermines a key purpose of the First Amendment: public accountability.
“Loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury,” the plaintiffs said in the motion for preliminary injunction, quoting a 2012 opinion issued by a federal judge in Illinois in a separate media access case.
The news entities pointed out in their complaint that the federal government permits journalists to observe executions conducted at the U.S. Penitentiary in Terre Haute.
They also held that Indiana’s law treats the press more harshly than other members of the public. While victims’ families and a condemned person’s friends or clergy may attend, the media is explicitly barred unless a journalist is handpicked by the inmate.
“The statute and policy single out the press for disfavorable treatment,” attorneys said in the complaint.
“A lack of press access leaves the public with an incomplete understanding of the proceedings,” they continued, citing examples from recent federal executions in which journalists documented botched attempts and unusual behavior by medical staff or inmates — observations that would not have been publicly known otherwise.
State contends media already have access
But in a 25-page filing submitted Thursday, the state pushed back, arguing that executions are not judicial proceedings covered by the First Amendment’s right of public access. 
The attorney general’s office additionally emphasized that Indiana law permits inmates to designate up to five witnesses — potentially including reporters — meaning journalists are not categorically banned.
“This lawsuit seeks to establish privileged access for the press beyond what the law generally provides the public,” state attorneys wrote. “The Constitution does not mandate privileging the press.”
Defendants also argued that executions are not part of the judicial or adjudicative process, and said in their response that a criminal prosecution comes to an end once a sentence is imposed. 
“After that, the individual is committed to the executive for execution of the sentence,” the attorney general’s office wrote.
Story continues below.

The office leaned on a 19th-century U.S. Supreme Court decision that gave states broad power to regulate executions — including who can witness them. 
“These are regulations which the legislature, in its wisdom, and for the public good, could legally prescribe,” the state quoted from Holden v. Minnesota, decided in 1890. The attorney general’s office emphasized that even banning press entirely from executions is constitutionally permissible.
The state also criticized the plaintiffs for waiting until days before the execution to file their motion, calling the timing “inequitable” and a bid to delay a lawfully imposed sentence.
 “They waited … until only seven days and three minutes before the scheduled initiation of the execution they now seek to enjoin,” the filing continued.
The state warned, too, that any sudden change in procedure, such as allowing unvetted media access, could complicate operations and compromise staff anonymity.
“Adding an unknown number of persons into the facility and into this process to witness a currently undefined portion of this procedure greatly complicates the strong interest the State has in performing a complex operation,” per the attorney general’s office.
New details about execution protocols
State officials have largely shielded details about how Indiana executions are carried out, but the state’s motion — in addition to a declaration provided by Indiana State Prison Warden Ron Neal — sheds light on DOC’s extensive planning and training.
According to the state, executions are performed by a specially-trained group that’s divided into multiple sub-units ,including an injection team, IV team, extraction team, and a death watch unit.
Each member of the execution team must pass medical, psychological and background screenings. The teams regularly train every two to three months, but when a death warrant is scheduled, that schedule increases to biweekly. 
New document shows Indiana paid $900,000 for execution drug, but other details still sparse

Since the Indiana Supreme Court issued the death warrant for Ritchie on April 15, the teams have been training weekly, Neal said.
Hands-on training involves simulations for IV insertion using EMS-provided equipment and infrared technology to locate veins.
Thirty days before an execution, officials begin preparations inside the facility, Neal noted in his declaration. 
The condemned inmate undergoes a medical evaluation and weekly assessments of their veins for IV access. The execution chamber is cleaned and inspected weekly, then daily in the final five days before the scheduled execution date. 
Equipment, supplies, and communication systems — linking the prison and the chamber to the governor’s office, the Indiana Supreme Court and internal command centers — are tested, as well.
Prison officials meet with the inmate to discuss the lethal injection process, witness lists and options for final statements and spiritual advisement.
The DOC protocol also includes test runs to ensure the victim’s family is kept separate from the condemned’s witnesses. Two-way radios on separate frequencies from normal prison traffic ensure real-time coordination throughout the process.
Gov. Mike Braun rejected a clemency plea from Ritchie on Wednesday, one day after the Indiana Parole Board recommended that the death row inmate’s upcoming execution proceed as scheduled.
Ritchie, who fatally shot Beech Grove law enforcement officer William Toney during a police pursuit on Sept. 29, 2000, had petitioned the board to commute his death sentence to life without parole.

(Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)ALMA, Ark. — Dozens of people attended a public hearing Thursday at the Alma Community Center near Fort Smith, where several individuals and elected officials spoke about how pungent odors from land-application operations in the area have affected their lives and region. 
Denali, a waste recycling company that applies waste left over from chicken and other industrial processing, has earned the ire of Sebastian and Crawford County residents due to overpowering odors from a sludge lagoon in Van Buren and huge increases in the amount of waste it applies to fields in the area.
Now, with one of its Crawford County land application permits up for renewal, that ire was on full display at the hearing held by the Arkansas Division of Environmental Quality. Not one person who spoke during the comment period spoke in favor of granting the permit renewal.
  The permit 

Denali’s application to renew an existing land application permit in Crawford County would add 670 acres of applicable fields to the roughly 1,500 acres already permitted.
Denali has struggled to comply with — and knowingly violated, according to records — its permits in recent months. Starting last year, Denali began land application within 24 hours of predicted rainfall, which is a violation of its permits, despite a rebuke from DEQ’s top water official. That culminated in a $19,800 fine earlier this year, something many residents have called “a slap in the face” for being too low.
The state of Missouri’s decision to disallow Denali from land application on Missouri fields led to an effective doubling of land application volume in Arkansas, according to Arkansas state records. In the same 2024 letter, the company pressed ADEQ to speed up the approval process for multiple pending land application permits.
  The hearing 

A restaurant owner among those who spoke at the hearing in Alma, said he couldn’t use his patio when the odor wafted over Fort Smith. The patio made up 20% of his revenue, he said.
Michael Gray, a wildlife biologist, said he bought land in the area in 2021 for recreational waterfowl hunting, with the additional hope of restoring the wetlands on it as well. Denali’s land application directly next to his property, he said, had potentially left his wetlands “damaged forever.” 
“Now learning that ADEQ fined the company only $19,000 for repeated violations is a slap in my face since I spent nearly double that” to try to clean up pollution he believes is caused by Denali’s land application practices. 
Meanwhile, Neva and Ralph Bogner, who have repeatedly complained to the Division of Environmental Quality about Denali’s permit violations, expressed concerns about the land the company wanted to add to the permit as part of the renewal. 
They said they could already smell the waste being applied to the fields two miles away at times, with Ralph Bogner previously describing the smell as one “like death.” If DEQ approves the permit renewal, a new field only a mile away will be available for waste application, Neva Bogner said.
Local officials expressed frustrations with Denali when they took to the microphone, with at-large Fort Smith City Director Christina Catsavis saying the company went back on a 2019 promise that it would shut down the Van Buren lagoon. The smell was impacting the area’s growth and economic prospects, multiple officials said, causing events to be cancelled and outdoor recreation to be unenjoyable.
“These odors are pungent and nauseating,” Catsavis said. “Denali has not demonstrated a responsible approach to their operation, and the history of complaints, legal action and public disruption should weigh heavily against permit renewal.”
Fort Smith Mayor George McGill made similar remarks, adding that the stench had even caught the attention of the F-35 fighter training facility located in the city.
State Rep. Cindy Crawford, R-Fort Smith, also addressed the room, saying that after hearing the comments of area residents, she planned to ask Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders to help, saying, “We can’t do this.”
Nancy LaPierre, a spokesperson for Denali, said assertions by the speakers that Denali did not live in the area or understand the smell were incorrect.
“We live and work here too, right?” she told the Advocate after the hearing. “And the communities are important to us. … We heard everything that folks had to say here. We do have a plan in place that we have been executing and we’ll continue to execute.”
Rep. Brad Hall, R-Alma, wrote Act 1009 of 2025, a new state law that requires DEQ to levy the maximum penalty on future land application violations. After the hearing, he said that while he was optimistic Denali would solve the problem, he was prepared to take further action in the 2027 session if necessary.
“We have a year and a half to come up with different avenues,” Hall said.
A decision has not been made as to whether DEQ will grant the permit renewal.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)Our state has a shadowed history when it comes to racial issues that includes the forced removal of Native Americans on Trail of Tears, the slaughter of Black residents during Tulsa Race Massacre and a 2007 law touted to be the nation’s harshest anti-immigrant state law.
I’ve long watched as Oklahoma’s elected officials have failed to learn from and rectify that dark history. Instead, they’ve oft chosen to embark on campaigns that seem to further highlight those past inequities.
It had seemed that we were growing more comfortable with teaching public school students about these dark tales. My administrators were supportive of history teachers teaching about injustices in our criminal justice system, lawful racial segregation and the abuse of immigrants. In fact, I was allowed to discuss how the best of our pioneer spirit has been intertwined with immigration from a variety of countries. Immigrants brought with them the values of hard work, family and community.
But today, we are again seeing a cruel backlash against migrants and communities who are racially different.
That backlash has included prohibitions against discussing “race” in schools. State Superintendent Ryan Walters has attempted to pass a requirement that “students must provide proof of U.S. citizenship when enrolling in public school.” It would also force schools to report to the state the number of students “who couldn’t verify legal residency or citizenship.”
Moreover, under an agreement with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, some Oklahoma law enforcement officers can “arrest individuals without a warrant if they are suspected of violating immigration laws” if it is believed that they “are likely to evade capture.” But even that raises the question as to who makes that judgment call.
Oklahoma City has been in the headlines after a mother and her daughters were traumatized by a raid conducted at the wrong home by federal officers. They were forced outside their apartment in their underclothes by agents who had misidentified them. The officers ripped up their home, seized phones and took much of the woman’s life savings. And, they didn’t give any information about getting her property back.
And Gov. Kevin Stitt recently generated ire when he vetoed a bill funding the Office of Liaison for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Persons on the national advocacy day that brings attention to the crisis. Hours before his veto, Indigenous advocates were rallying outside the state Capitol to bring attention to the fact that our state has the second highest number of missing Native Americans. Stitt argued in his veto message that “justice must be blind to race.”
I’ll also never forget when lawmakers passed the Oklahoma Taxpayer and Citizen Protection Act of 2007, which was designed to be the nation’s harshest anti-immigrant state law. After that law took effect, federal agents would intimidate parents as they dropped their kids off at elementary schools. When one of my student’s family was deported for legally driving down the Broadway Extension, they were forced to get down on their knees. They unsuccessfully begged the police officer to not turn them over to ICE.
The law accomplished nothing except for spreading a “culture of fear,” and opposition to it grew. As Hispanic workers exited the state, business leaders, church congregations, and civil rights advocates joined the fight against anti-immigrant racism.
I’m encouraged that today’s cycle of cruelty is also bringing forth another, and I believe larger, side of our nation and state, which is coming to the defense of immigrants. For instance, there has been bipartisan pushback, including by Stitt, against Walters’ support for immigration raids in schools, and collecting information about immigrants that would be turned over to the federal government.
But we’re at a crossroads. Do we embrace the dark side, which has traditionally been driven by fear and racism, or do we embrace a path of inclusionary hope that aims to not repeat the mistakes of our past?
Today’s attacks on immigrants are an outgrowth of our dark side, but I have reason to believe that we’ll choose the path of hope by learning from the sordid sides of our past.
I believe there will be a time again when our political leaders recognize the proven economic benefits brought by undocumented workers. I believe we’ll again recognize the harm that is done to our reputation when Oklahoma doesn’t stand up for its residents.
Because if there’s one thing I’ve learned over the years, it’s that doing the right thing always encourages economic investments, entrepreneurs, and brings new opportunities to our state.

Trout Unlimited’s Trout-in-the-classroom program brought five Wind River Indian Reservation schools outside last week for the finale: releasing fry in Washakie Reservoir. 
The post Casting Wyoming kiddos out of the classroom appeared first on WyoFile .","WASHAKIE RESERVOIR—Eliah Duren’s fingers pinched a clear plastic cup. 
Rainbow trout fry writhed inside. 
The classmate critiques started coming. Too many fish. Too little water. They’d been confined for too long. Duren’s fellow seventh graders urged him to complete the release. A reservoir awaited a few dozen yards away. 
“That’s a Travis Scott concert right there,” Eli Washakie said of the crowded cup.

Another youngster was more blunt: “I think they’re gonna die soon.” 
Duren held his ground. 
“They’re part of my family now,” he joked. “I can’t just let them go.” 
The calls to free the fry persisted. Moments later, the diminutive salmonids swam off. 
The middle school banter on the banks of Washakie Reservoir was set in motion by Trout Unlimited’s Trout-in-the-classroom program. The swarms of fry that swam off this spring morning spent their earliest days of life in seven tanks distributed around the Wind River Indian Reservation. 
“We have all five reservation schools represented here,” said Jeremy Molt, Shoshone and Arapaho Fish and Game’s youth coordinator. “This is one of the only programs where you’ll see all the reservation schools coming together — usually, they don’t do anything like this.”

Rearing trout in classroom tanks for their eventual release is the bait that gets kids hooked on lesson plans about watersheds and fisheries, Trout Unlimited’s Cory Toye said. Mike Mazur, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service fish biologist, commended the effort. 
“They’re trying to reconnect the kids back to natural resources: Get them outside, exposed to something other than a screen,” he said. “Especially for tribal people, the connection to the natural world is really important.”
On May 7, the middle and high school students, usually cooped up in classrooms, relished the chance to get outside.

But shifting market and political forces challenge state’s otherwise reliable and expanding trona mining industry.
The post From toothpaste to beer bottles to industrial batteries, the world relies on Wyoming’s ‘white gold’ appeared first on WyoFile .","GREEN RIVER—After a four-minute elevator descent into the bowels of southwest Wyoming, dropping deep enough to bury the Empire State Building, a Tata Chemicals trona miner drove two Wyoming journalists in a truck 8.5 miles through catacombs, crossing under unaware motorists on Interstate 80 above, to where a crew was using an electric boring machine to chew into a wall of trona.
The visitors — briefed on safety protocols and equipped with underground attire and emergency devices — trudged through fresh mud bubbling with methane. Sections were added to a chartreuse inflatable tube that unrolled like a party favor and blew fresh air at the miners, who had just finished patching a small water line break. 
Beams of light from hard hats swiveled and sparred in the tunnel as the earth moaned and machinery hummed. Soon, the machinery funneled a stream of sandwich-sized chunks of trona onto a fast-moving conveyor that would eventually deliver it to the surface to be processed into a fine, white powder and shipped around the world.

Have you ever brushed your teeth with toothpaste? Drank beer from a bottle or stared at the road through a car windshield? The white stuff — sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃) to be precise — calms your heartburn and washes your socks. Check under your sink. Take a look in your bathroom cabinet. Many of those taken-for-granted products you use daily require an ingredient sourced from the depths of southwest Wyoming, and the sweat of underground miners.
Tata’s mine, along with its soda ash processing facilities at the surface, is among four such operations in Wyoming — all clustered in an area near the towns of Green River and Granger. Combined, they produce about 10 million tons of soda ash annually and feed 90% of the nation’s soda ash consumption. Wyoming producers make up more than 14% of the global market, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Soda ash, in fact, accounts for more than half of Wyoming’s global commodity exports with a whopping $1.3 billion worth of shipments annually, according to industry officials and state economists.
Wyoming coal can’t say that. Not even close. 
Despite the industry’s global importance and massive operations, employing some 2,500 workers in the state, it plods along without much fanfare. Unless you live in the region, you might not even know about trona or its role in everyday life.
“If you’re in Cheyenne and you say ‘trona’ or ‘soda ash,’ a lot of people will say, ‘What’s that?'” said longtime Green River resident Stan Blake who served as House District 39 representative from 2007 to 2020. The business, perhaps, is guilty of being kind of boring, or simply void of political drama, Blake suggested. “It’s just been steady for years and years, so it doesn’t get talked about much.”
An Interstate 80 sign marks the spot where Tata Chemicals’ underground tunnels finger under the roadway where cars and semis are whizzing by 1,600 feet above. The trona mine includes many miles of tunnels from decades of mining. (Dustin Bleizeffer/WyoFile)
It was a mystery, even to many who began their careers in coal mining and wound up at this trona mine. “I wasn’t even aware of trona until I came to Wyoming,” said Mine Electrical Planner Kale Pitt. When asked about the significance of the industry, another Tata miner said, “Other than they make glass and soap out of it, that’s about all I know. It’s a good way to make a living, I guess.”
The miner turned his headlamp and went back to the business at hand.
He was spot on, in Blake’s estimation, who was never a trona miner himself. He spent more than 30 years on the rails and in train yards rather than chipping at trona in Wyoming’s subterranean, but he knows his Green River neighbors and notices toys in driveways.
“The level of lifestyle out here is higher, probably, than a lot of other places in the state,” Blake said. “It seems like everybody’s got a boat and they go out to Flaming Gorge and fish. And everybody — all the miners — like to hunt. The [trona] mines are really, really relevant here in Sweetwater County, that’s for sure.” 
Perhaps less glorious than coal, less loud than oil, there are changes afoot in the trona industry with implications, both good and potentially not so good, for Wyoming.
Optimism and expansion 
Baking soda and Range Rover windshields aside, Wyoming trona mine owners have been scrambling to meet new opportunities while bracing for headwinds.

On the opportune side, there’s wildly escalating demand for batteries and solar energy panels across the globe, according to industry reports. Though the business of toothpaste and baking soda doesn’t change much, global manufacturers are keen on ramping up production of energy components vital to meeting low-carbon initiatives. They can’t do it without more trona processed into soda ash. And Wyoming has a lot of trona — the largest known deposit in the world, according to industry and federal officials. Ninety percent of the world’s mineable, or “natural,” trona ore is right here in southwest Wyoming, they say.
“The world has an insatiable appetite for soda ash,” said Wyoming Tata’s Director of Governmental Affairs Jon Conrad, also a former Wyoming legislator. By Conrad’s estimation, the industry in Wyoming aims to expand — perhaps even double production in the next eight or so years.

In addition to Tata’s plans to crank out more soda ash while trimming its cost of production, neighboring producer WE Soda — with a larger operation than Tata’s — has launched a multi-billion-dollar expansion that’s crossing permitting milestones. A big part of that effort, “Project West,” will include “solution” mining, or pumping water into the trona deposits to flush the material to the surface rather than sending legions of boat-owning miners underground, according to the company.
Federal regulators also recently advanced permitting for a potential fifth trona operation in the region — Pacific Soda’s proposed Dry Creek Trona Mine project, which would also pull trona via water injection-and-return wells. The operation would create an estimated additional 300 full-time jobs in the region, according to the company.

All of that optimism and investment, however, might stand a little broadside to some shifting market and political winds.
Shifting markets
Wyoming’s trona industry has, for decades, won an advantage for producing “natural” soda ash. It’s pretty simple: mine the rocks, crush them, dissolve and dehydrate the mineral and ship it to customers. But for the past couple of decades, China and Turkey have ramped up production of synthetic soda ash — a product derived from flushing sodium carbonate-containing material from more prevalent, less pure deposits.
Synthetic soda ash threatens to beat out natural soda ash on price, according to industry officials. Though Wyoming producers claim their product is superior for both its quality and lower-carbon footprint, natural soda ash producers must find efficiencies to lower their cost of production.
Solution mining is one major cost-efficiency strategy, according to Conrad. Another is finding alternatives to expensive electrical power and other forms of energy.

Mining trona and processing it into soda ash requires a lot of electricity — about a continuous 32 megawatts at Tata Chemicals, according to the company. One megawatt is enough electricity to power about 750 homes. Tata produces about 90% of its own electricity, via coal and natural gas burners, which also generate steam used in the refining process. But the operation relies on utility provider Rocky Mountain Power for the rest of its electricity needs, and those costs keep climbing. Tata wants to reduce or eliminate its reliance on Rocky Mountain Power by incorporating nuclear energy.
Last year, the company inked a letter of intent with BWXT Advanced Technologies to install up to eight nuclear microreactors on site, boosting Tata’s self-produced electrical power to about 40 megawatts — enough to meet expansion plans without increasing its reliance on Rocky Mountain Power. “The microreactors offer a carbon-free, reliable source of energy that can support [Tata Chemicals’] operations and contribute to the state’s energy portfolio,” the company said in a prepared statement.
But even the industry’s best-laid plans to increase its competitive edge could be derailed by politics. President Donald Trump’s tariff wars take particular aim at China, which accounts for about 10% of Wyoming soda ash sales. If the country retaliates with its own tariffs, it could be a major blow to the industry, according to University of Wyoming Associate Professor of Economics Rob Godby. It might even dampen the industry’s plans to expand operations.
“That could be a really significant impact on our [soda ash] exports,” Godby said.
Back underground, Mine Production Supervisor Eric Castillon proudly described a continual process of increasing production efficiencies in a never-ending effort to sustain the company’s competitive edge.
“This is the trona capital of the world,” Castillon said over the hum of a mobile conveyor carrying rock to the surface. “I can see this mine going for another 50 to 100 years. Trona’s not going anywhere, as long as there’s a need for it.”

(Photo by Evan Houk/Maine Morning Star)The tax cut legislation that U.S. House of Representatives Republicans are putting together in Washington includes measures that will cost thousands of jobs in Wisconsin and undercut the state’s progress toward cleaner energy, according to environmental and labor advocates.
To help pay for the extension of tax cuts enacted in the first Trump administration, the GOP-led House Ways and Means Committee is proposing to repeal clean energy tax credits, Politico reported this week. The tax credits were among the measures enacted in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).
“These credits are not just numbers on a balance sheet out in Washington D.C,” said Emily Pritzkow, executive director of the Wisconsin Building Trades Council, in an online press conference Wednesday. “They are representing real jobs, real economic growth, and real progress towards Wisconsin’s sustainable energy infrastructure. Since the IRA was signed into law in 2022 we have seen an unprecedented boom in clean energy development in the trades.”
The press conference was hosted by Forward Together Wisconsin, a nonprofit established to inform people about the Biden administration’s infrastructure and climate investments and to defend them.
“We’ve been seeing this real opportunity to drive energy costs down, and I cannot for the life of me understand why people want to reverse that progress,” said former Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, president of Forward Together Wisconsin.
In addition to the tax credits that the U.S. House proposal would repeal, President Donald Trump in his second term has frozen federal clean energy grants that were part of the 2022 legislation. Those include grants to establish a network of electric vehicle charging stations — prompting a lawsuit by 15 states, including Wisconsin.
Solar energy investments that have boomed in the last three years are among those that are threatened by the House proposal, according to advocates.
“At a time when billions of dollars are being invested in states that overwhelmingly voted for President Trump, this proposed legislation will effectively dismantle the most successful industrial onshoring effort in U.S. history,” Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association, said in a statement this week.
Since passage of the IRA, Wisconsin has seen $933 million in clean energy and transportation private-sector investments, along with just over $2 billion from federal grants and loans, according to Innovation Policy & Technology, a San Francisco climate change policy think tank. The organization tallied 61 new clean energy and transportation projects that got underway in the state, with 45 manufacturing American-made products.
“Lower investment and higher energy bills due to repealing these federal programs and tax incentives will cost nearly 5,200 Wisconsin jobs in 2030 and more than 6,400 jobs in 2035, compared to current policies,” Innovation Policy & Technology reported.
The advocacy group Climate Power has calculated that without the federal support $5.4 billion for 15 planned Wisconsin clean energy projects could be in jeopardy.
Of those projects, 12 — 80% — are in five congressional districts represented by Republicans, according to Climate Power. Three representatives of those districts — Bryan Steil in the 1st CD, Scott Fitzgerald in the 5th CD and Glenn Grothman in the 6th CD — voted against the IRA in 2022. The other two, Derrick Van Orden in the 3rd CD and Tony Wied in the 8th CD, weren’t in office at the time but publicly opposed the legislation.
John Jacobs, business manager of International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 494 in Southeast Wisconsin, said the clean energy tax credits and related policies have spurred investment and employment for the union’s members.
“I see first-hand how the clean energy tax credits have delivered on their promise, creating good family-sustaining union jobs across Wisconsin,” Jacobs said. “Repealing these tax credits could be devastating to many, but would put thousands of jobs at risk and hurt a growing industry.”
The tax credits were “an investment in America,” he added. The jobs lost if the credits are repealed “translate to economic instability for families across our state.”
The IRA also included a provision that extends the value of the tax credits to nonprofit organizations and government agencies.
Thanks to that benefit, called direct support payment, the Menasha Joint School District in the Fox Valley has qualified for a $4 million reimbursement from the federal government for installing rooftop solar energy and geothermal energy systems in a school currently under construction, said Brian Adesso, the school district’s business services director.
Once the school is complete the district expects to save $159,000 a year on its electric bill, “which is cost savings to local taxpayers and money that can be invested back into the students and staff,” Adesso said at the Forward Wisconsin press conference.
Adesso said the tax credits gave the district “certainty” it needed to be willing to undertake the clean energy additions to the project. Killing the credits would make that choice harder for school districts and impose higher costs on local property taxpayers, he added.
“The bill making its way through Congress takes a sledgehammer to the tax credits,” Addesso said — ending some credits early and attaching “bureaucratic restrictions that could make many of the credits unusable.”
Barnes said Forward Wisconsin Together is calling on Congress to protect the clean energy initiatives. “The people of Wisconsin deserve better,” he said. “The country deserves better. Clean energy as we know is the future, and we have to continue to invest in it.”

“We’re always thrilled to announce the opening of the aerial tram, because it marks the official beginning of summer at Jackson Hole Mountain Resort,” said Tim Mason, vice president of operations. “The tram is the highest point that many people will access in the Tetons. There are wonderful hiking opportunities and 360-degree views, and skiing is still available in the backcountry. We look forward to welcoming everyone back to experience the unique adventures our aerial tram offers.”
Following the tram‘s opening Saturday, Jackson Hole Mountain Resort‘s bike park, and a via ferrata rock climbing route, are scheduled to open in June, as conditions allow.  
Information about prices for tram rides, activities, weather and mountain conditions is available online at www.jacksonhole.com. Early season conditions and snow exist in the Teton Range. 
The tram is scheduled to operate daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. through Oct. 6.
Because the tram drops riders off at the top of a mountain above 10,000 feet in elevation, guests should be prepared with clothing, enough warm layers and appropriate footwear to remain warm and dry.

For more than three years, Tennessee reporters heard how they would “learn the truth” about how former House staffer Cade Cothren got the raw end of a deal when he was indicted on political corruption charges.
But when Cothren refused to testify on his own behalf and neither the defense nor the prosecution called House Speaker Cameron Sexton to the stand, we all went home wondering why we hadn’t heard the truth and, worse, why we spent hours covering this debacle of a trial. It’s not yielding much new information.
Jurors also had to be wondering why they gave up their lives for a month to sit through umpteen bench conferences and try to figure out whether Cothren and former House Speaker Glen Casada broke the law by keeping Phoenix Solutions’ operations secret to make $52,000, likely a pittance compared to the amount of money paid to defense attorneys and spent by the federal government to investigate and try this case.
This is a cautionary tale for those making $200,000 a year and suddenly losing it, as was Cothren’s case.
Cothren’s story was that he helped Sexton ascend to the speakership in late 2019 because he still had some pull with supporters of Casada, who stepped down from the speakership that August after a no-confidence vote. He requested the phone log he claims showed he was in constant communication with Sexton in 2019 before getting kicked to the curb. Meanwhile, Sexton cooperated with the FBI and was expected to be a star witness for the prosecution, while also being subpoenaed by the defense.
Court filing: Sexton likely wore a wire for federal investigators

He came out unscathed amid speculation fueled by defense attorneys that he or someone in his office wore a wire and recorded conversations with lawmakers. If so, the prosecution didn’t use them.
The defense didn’t call any witnesses, either, even though it subpoenaed half of the legislature to testify. The move raised questions about whether those in Casada’s camp wanted to be hammered by prosecutors, especially since most received chairmanships to back his ascension to the throne.
As the trial crawled into its 19th day Thursday, jurors in their third day of deliberation pored over dozens of pages of instructions and grew more confused by the minute, evidenced by questions they asked the court about how to apply the rules to 19 counts of fraud, bribery, kickbacks and conspiracy, creating more potential for confusion.
The judge and attorneys acknowledged they didn’t understand the jury’s Thursday question, thus were uncertain about how to answer it. The back-and-forth didn’t exactly engender confidence in the legal system.
In short, the court asked jurors to slide a camel through the eye of a needle, which someone said is as hard as it is for a rich man to give up all earthly possessions and follow Jesus.
“Is there anyone home?”
The Tennessee Registry of Election Finance dismissed a “collusion” complaint this week against Republican Sen. Bobby Harshbarger’s 2024 campaign in upper East Tennessee.
Sen. Ken Yager, chairman of the Senate Republican Caucus, asked for the dismissal after filing the complaint last year claiming the East Tennessee Conservatives PAC and Congresswoman Diana Harshbarger’s campaign illegally coordinated to support her son’s effort when he defeated incumbent Sen. Jon Lundberg of Bristol.
Apparently, all is forgiven.
Registry members Tom Lawless and Paige Burcham Dennis said last October the Registry should subpoena Thomas Datwyler, treasurer for the PAC and the congresswoman’s campaign, to answer questions and provide financial information after two groups poured $600,000 worth of dark money into the Republican primary.

The Registry sent out the demand, but the whole thing turned out to be a tempest in a teapot, when the Attorney General’s Office gave a half-hearted report on the matter and the Registry failed to hunt down the Wisconsin-based Datwyler to testify.
“It’s just one of those where nobody was here to prosecute it,” Lawless said at Tuesday’s Registry board meeting. He added that Yager’s request made the difference.
The Registry is seeking more funding from the legislature to add auditors and investigators, since the AG’s Office glossed over the matter and sent a message that it can’t be called on constantly to do the Registry’s legal work. But getting extra money from the legislature will be difficult, especially when the Registry’s job is to police it.
Staving off pain
Tennessee is set to resume executions May 22, after Gov. Bill Lee called for a hiatus because of questions about the protocol for drugs used to kill people.
A group of death row prisoners filed a challenge in Davidson County Chancery Court to the state’s request for a protective order to keep secret information about lethal injection chemicals and qualifications and training of executioners. 
Suddenly things are moving rapidly because Oscar Franklin Smith, 75, is set to die next week by lethal injection for the 1989 murders of his estranged wife and her two sons. The execution date comes three years after his death was postponed when Gov. Bill Lee ordered a halt because prison staff failed to test lethal injection drugs properly to see if they were contaminated.
They say the state is purposely using drugs with the risk of being “adulterated and lacking in potency, and which will very likely cause superadded pain and suffering.”
Tennessee is planning to use manufactured pentobarbital for the executions, a point the inmates say is significant because no commercial manufacturer will sell the drug to departments of correction for executions.
Bill to allow public access to lethal injection records on the rocks after state lobbies against it

Their attorney, Kelley Henry, said if the Department of Correction were buying execution chemicals from “legitimate” suppliers and ensuring purity and potency and using properly trained personnel to handle executions, the state wouldn’t need “a veil of secrecy.”
“This means that the pentobarbital Tennessee has acquired was obtained on the gray market,” which is “inherently risky,” according to the inmates’ release.
A trial is set for Jan. 12, 2026 because the state said it couldn’t be ready sooner.
But the governor doesn’t appear ready to postpone the Smith execution again.
According to spokesperson Elizabeth Johnson, “As Gov. Lee has said, he believes the death penalty is a serious matter and an appropriate punishment for the most heinous crimes; it’s why he instructed the Tennessee Department of Correction to conduct a thorough review of the lethal injection protocol to leave no question that lawful and effective procedures are followed. The governor thoroughly reviews each case and has full confidence in the Department’s ability to oversee this process in compliance with the revised protocol.”
We’re glad someone has confidence in the Department of Correction.
“When she squeezed me tight …”
The ACLU of Tennessee and Holland & Associates are challenging the state’s refusal to issue driver’s licenses and state ID documents to transgender residents reflecting their gender change.
“Our clients need accurate identification documents in order to travel for work and family, to vote, and to engage in everyday life like everyone else. Forcing them to carry identification that contradicts who they are — or else withholding that identification altogether — is cruel, unfair and unlawful,” ACLU-TN senior attorney Lucas Cameron-Vaughn said in a statement.
Two unnamed transgender women claim their lives have been disrupted, putting them at risk for more discrimination, harassment and possible violence.
One of the women said the Department of Safety and Homeland Security ordered her to surrender her license or have her driving privileges revoked. A Davidson County judge stopped that move.

It’s not clear why the legislature and state are so concerned about people’s sexual preferences, other than to maintain a constant barrage of culture skirmishes.
Consider this question: Does transgender status affect a person’s ability to drive a car? Probably not.
The state should be more concerned about those yahoos driving motorcycles 150 mph and scaring the crap out of everybody on the road. 
But in their infinite wisdom they’re putting more resources into deporting immigrants, forcing businesses to shut down and cracking down on transgender folks. And for what?
Recycled governor
Proving that you’re never too old to go to the office, former Gov. Bill Haslam is set to start serving on the University of Tennessee Board of Trustees, thanks to an appointment by House Speaker Sexton.
The Haslam family name is all over the UT system, mainly the Knoxville campus, so this isn’t exactly shocking. 
Sexton cited Haslam’s role in starting the Tennessee Promise for community colleges and technical schools and the Drive to 55, whose goal is for 55% of Tennesseans to hold some sort of education certificate or degree.
Don’t confuse that with Sammy Haggar’s “I Can’t Drive 55,” because nobody’s doing it unless police officers are standing on the side of the road with a radar detector.
The bigger question is whether Haslam will encourage UT President Randy Boyd to run for governor again or at least to buck President Trump and re-up the DEI program.

Glen who?
In case some folks wonder if the people of the great state of Tennessee, from Mountain City to Memphis, remember Glen Casada, let it be known at least one person does. That’s based on the F-bomb a motorist dropped on the former lawmaker when he walked up to the federal courthouse afternoon last week.
Welcome home, Mr. Speaker.

(Brett Kelman/KFF Health News)NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Federal prosecutors sought a maximum prison sentence of nearly 20 years for the CEO of Pain MD, a company found to have given hundreds of thousands of questionable injections to patients, many reliant on opioids. It would have been among the longest sentences for a health care executive convicted of fraud in recent years.
Instead, he got 18 months.
Michael Kestner, 73, who was convicted of 13 fraud felonies last year, faced at least a decade behind bars based on federal sentencing guidelines. He was granted the substantially lightened sentence due to his age and health Wednesday during a federal court hearing in Nashville.
U.S. District Judge Aleta Trauger described Kestner as a “ruthless businessman” who funded a “lavish lifestyle” by turning medical professionals into “puppets” who pressured patients into injections that did not help their pain and sometimes made it worse.
“In the court’s eyes, he knew it was wrong, and he didn’t really care if it was doing anyone any good,” Trauger said.
But Trauger also said she was swayed by defense arguments that Kestner would struggle in federal prison due to his age and medical conditions, including the blood disorder hemochromatosis. Trauger said she had concerns about prison health care after considering about 200 requests for compassionate release in other court cases.
“The medical care at these facilities,” defense attorney Peter Strianse said, “has always been dodgy and suspect.”
Kestner did not speak at the court hearing, other than to detail his medical conditions. He did not respond to questions as he left the courthouse.
Pain clinics made millions from ‘unnecessary’ injections into ‘human pin cushions’

Pain MD ran as many as 20 clinics in Tennessee, Virginia, and North Carolina throughout much of the 2010s. While many doctors were scaling back their use of prescription painkillers due to the opioid crisis, Pain MD paired opioids with monthly injections into patients’ backs, claiming the shots could ease pain and potentially lessen reliance on pills, according to federal court documents.
During Kestner’s October trial, the Department of Justice proved that the injections were part of a decade-long scheme that defrauded Medicare and other insurance programs of millions of dollars by capitalizing on patients’ dependence on opioids.
The DOJ successfully argued at trial that Pain MD’s “unnecessary and expensive injections” were largely ineffective because they targeted the wrong body part, contained short-lived numbing medications but no steroids, and appeared to be based on test shots given to cadavers — people who felt neither pain nor relief because they were dead. During closing arguments, the DOJ argued Pain MD had turned some patients into “human pin cushions.”
“They were leaned over a table and repeatedly injected in their spine,” federal prosecutor Katherine Payerle said during the May 14 sentencing hearing. “Over and over, month after month, at the direction of Mr. Kestner.”
At last year’s trial, witnesses testified that Kestner was the driving force behind the injections, which amounted to roughly 700,000 shots over about eight years, with some patients receiving up to 24 at once.
Four former patients testified that they tolerated the shots out of fear that Pain MD otherwise would have cut off their painkiller prescriptions, without which they might have spiraled into withdrawal.
One of those patients, Michelle Shaw, told KFF Health News that the injections sometimes left her in so much pain she had to use a wheelchair. She was outraged by Kestner’s sentence.
“I’m disgusted that all they got was a slap on the wrist as far as I’m concerned,” Shaw said May 14. “I hope karma comes back to him. That he suffers to his last breath.”

(Henry Redman | Wisconsin Examiner)When he was campaigning for Congress in western Wisconsin, Republican U.S. Rep. Derrick Van Orden talked about growing up “in abject rural poverty,” raised by a single mom who relied on food stamps. As a result, he has said, he would never go along with cuts to food assistance. 
“He sat down in my office when he first got elected and promised me he wouldn’t ever vote against SNAP because he grew up on it, supposedly,” Democratic U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan said in a phone interview as he was on his way home to Wisconsin from Washington this week.
But as Henry Redman reported, Van Orden voted for the Republican budget blueprint, which proposes more than $200 billion in cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in order to make room for tax cuts for the very wealthy.
Still, after that vote, Van Orden issued a public statement warning against reckless cuts to SNAP that place “disproportionate burdens on rural states, where food insecurity is often more widespread,” and saying it is unfair to build a budget “on the backs of some of our most vulnerable populations, including hungry children. Period.”
Van Orden sits on the House Agriculture Committee, which was tasked with drawing up a specific plan to cut $230 billion from food assistance to pay for tax cuts. Van Orden reportedly balked at a cost-sharing plan that shifted 25% of the cost of the program to states, saying it was unfair to Wisconsin.
But then, on Wednesday night, Van Orden voted yes as the committee passed an unprecedented cut in federal funding for SNAP on a 29-25 vote.
Van Orden took credit for the plan, which ties cuts to state error rates in determining eligibility and benefit amounts for food assistance. According to WisPolitics, he declared at a House Ag Committee markup that “states are going to have to accept the fact that if they are not administering this program efficiently, that they’re going to have to pay a portion of the program that is equitable, and it makes sense and it is scaled.” 
But states, including Wisconsin, don’t have money to make up the gap as the federal government, for the first time ever, withdraws hundreds of millions of dollars for nutrition assistance. Instead, they will reduce coverage, kick people off the program and hunger will increase. The ripple effects include a loss of about $30 billion for farmers who supply food for the program, Democrats on the Ag Committee report, and damage to the broader economy, since every $1 in SNAP benefits generates about $1.50 in economic activity. Grocery stores, food manufacturers rural communities will be hit particularly hard. 
Wisconsin will start out with a bill for 5% of the costs of the program in Fiscal Year 2028, according to a bill explanation from the Agriculture Committee. But as error rates vary, that number shifts sharply upward — to 15% when the error rate goes from the current 5% to 6%, to 20% if we exceed an 8% error rate, and so on.  
And there are other cuts in the bill, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minnesota) points out, including stricter eligibility limits, work requirements that cannot be waived in times of economic hardship and high unemployment, and reductions in benefits that come from eliminating deductions for utility costs. 
More than 900,000 children, adults, and seniors count on Wisconsin’s SNAP program, known as FoodShare, according to an analysis of state health department data by Kids Forward. The same analysis found that covering the costs of just 10% of SNAP benefits would cost Wisconsin $136 million. 
Alaska and Texas have higher error rates than Wisconsin, and so they — and their hungry kids — are stuck with the biggest cuts. Even if you accept that that is somehow just, the people who are going to pay for this bill in all the states, including ours, are, as Van Orden himself put it, “the most vulnerable populations, including hungry children. Period.”
“He says one thing and does another,” Pocan says of Van Orden’s flip-flopping on SNAP. “He’s gone totally Washington.”
That’s too bad for the people left behind in rural Wisconsin, who will take the brunt of these unnecessary cuts.

(Mario Tama | Getty Images)In the wake of President Donald Trump’s executive order aiming to reinstate “common sense” school discipline, more states may follow and expand the authority of teachers and school officials to deal with disruptive students.
The order, signed in April, repeals prior federal guidance that encouraged schools to address racial disparities in discipline, arguing that such policies promoted “discriminatory equity ideology” and compromised school safety by pressuring administrators to underreport serious student misconduct.
In some states, new legislation already is trending toward giving teachers more authority to address student misbehavior.
In West Virginia, for example, a new law creates a structured process for responding to violent, threatening or disruptive behavior among students in grades K-6.
Under the law, a student exhibiting such behavior can be immediately removed from class, evaluated by counselors or behavioral specialists and placed on an individualized behavior plan. If there’s no improvement after two rounds of intervention, the student could be moved into a behavioral intervention program or an alternative learning environment.
West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey, a Republican, and supporters say the law empowers teachers to maintain safe classrooms.
“This legislation provides teachers with the tools to regain control of the classroom and ensure safe learning environments for our kids,” Morrisey said at the bill’s signing.
In April, the Texas House of Representatives passed a bill referred to as the “Teacher’s Bill of Rights” with a bipartisan vote of 124-20.
That bill, now sitting in the Senate’s education committee, would significantly expand the grounds for out-of-school suspensions, allowing students to be suspended for repeated disruptions or threats beginning in third grade. It would reverse earlier changes that limited suspensions for younger students. It also would mandate that students making terroristic threats or assaulting school employees be placed in alternative education programs for at least 30 days.
Texas civil rights groups argue that the bill would impose a one-size-fits-all punitive approach, rather than addressing students’ developmental and behavioral needs.
Alycia Castillo, associate director of policy at the Texas Civil Rights Project and a former teacher, said state lawmakers are taking the wrong approach by mandating sweeping discipline policies for a state as diverse as Texas.











Children are naturally disruptive — that’s part of their development.


– Alycia Castillo, associate director of policy at the Texas Civil Rights Project



During the 2020-21 school year, according to the latest data available from the U.S. Department of Education, Black students faced the highest rates of disciplinary action across all categories — suspension and expulsion — among all racial and ethnic groups.
They were 39% more likely than white students to receive in-school suspensions, 70% more likely to face out-of-school suspensions, and 71% more likely to be expelled.
The disparities were even starker for Black students with disabilities, who experienced suspension and expulsion rates far exceeding those of both their white peers and non-disabled students.
Reviving old, harsh disciplinary policies risks disproportionately harming students of color, students with disabilities and those from low-income backgrounds, Castillo said.
“What works in Austin may not work in West Texas,” Castillo said.
“Children are naturally disruptive — that’s part of their development,” she added. “Excluding them only harms their growth into functional adults.”
Restorative justice models
In recent years, some other states have passed laws promoting restorative practices in schools, in which students and teachers work through problems and focus on repairing the harm caused by disruptions or conflict.
Michigan’s 2017 law requires schools to consider restorative approaches before suspensions or expulsions, aiming to repair harm rather than exclude students. Nevada began mandating restorative justice approaches in 2019, but scaled back that approach in 2023.
This year, Maryland passed a law requiring the state to establish “restorative practices schools,” specific schools with trained educators who use the approach in everyday discipline.
Kimberly Hellerich, an assistant professor at Sacred Heart University and a former K-12 teacher, said discipline policies should go beyond punitive measures to foster accountability and community healing.
“Adding restorative practices to accompany codes of conduct can allow students to recognize the impact of their actions on themselves, peers, the teacher, the class and the school community,” Hellerich said.
In her own classrooms, Hellerich used what she called “community circles” to guide students in processing behavior, offering apologies and rebuilding trust. “The apology served as a way to restore the student’s relationship with the entire class community,” she said.
Calls for a cultural shift on expectations
While lawmakers debate discipline procedures, other education advocates warn that an even deeper issue is unfolding inside classrooms: the gradual erosion of behavioral expectations and academic rigor.











Discipline is the backbone of effective learning.


– Jessica Bartnick, co-founder and CEO of Foundation for C.H.O.I.C.E.



Jessica Bartnick, co-founder and CEO of the Dallas-based mentorship program Foundation for C.H.O.I.C.E., said that declining school discipline and lowered standards are quietly undermining educational outcomes.
“Discipline is the backbone of effective learning,” Bartnick, who supports the Texas legislation, told Stateline in an email. “Without it, classrooms become chaotic, instructional time is lost and teachers are forced to shift their focus from instruction to behavior management.”
Bartnick said efforts to promote equity sometimes inadvertently lower behavioral standards and deprive teachers of the tools they need to maintain safe learning environments.
She also criticized lenient grading policies and unlimited test retakes, arguing that they diminish the value of preparation, responsibility and resilience.
“If students are shielded from the discomfort of failure, they are also shielded from the growth that comes with it,” she wrote. “If we want to prepare students for a world that will not offer endless second chances, we must return to a classroom culture grounded in discipline, responsibility, and rigor.”

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Budgets are not just about money – they also reflect the values and priorities of a state and country. That is especially true now as the Republican-controlled Congress considers the “big, beautiful” tax cut bill President Trump wants approved.
If the final bill contains the tax cuts and budget cuts currently under consideration, it will be the largest tax cut in American history and one of the biggest program cuts in the history of the country as well. It would call for tax cuts of about $4.5 trillion — yes, that’s trillion – and billions of dollars in budget cuts to programs that benefit millions of Americans.
Even though most Americans will get something from the tax cuts, 45 percent of the tax savings will go to Americans earning more than $450,000 per year, according to the independent Tax Policy Center. 
Another study by the Wharton Business School at the University of Pennsylvania estimated that the lowest 80 percent of taxpayers would get 29 percent of the tax cuts, while the top 10 percent of income taxpayers would get 56 percent. 
The Tax Policy Center study said about 13 percent of middle-income families would see a tax increase with the plans currently under consideration. The greatest benefit families would receive is the extension of the current $2,000 per child tax credit which might even increase to $2,500. Even that benefit would be cut in half if Congress doesn’t act this year.
To help offset some — yet not all — of the cost of the tax cuts, Congress is looking to cut $1 billion from programs that benefit the most vulnerable Americans, especially children. They are looking at cutting or making it more difficult for low-income families to qualify for Medicaid, they are looking at cutting $230 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) which 40 million Americans rely on for food. Even the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), which provides health care for a third to more than 40 percent of children in 43 of Idaho’s 44 counties could be impacted. 
Idaho’s counties are already feeling the financial pinch of the Trump administration and Congress cutting funding for the Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Program. For example, Valley County will lose $1.3 million for schools, road projects, and suppression projects, according to the McCall Star-News. 
Under the Republican Congress’ plan, the biggest cuts would come from the Medicaid program, which would have a major negative impact on millions of Americans and Idahoans.
One in five Americans – 20 percent – get their health care through Medicaid. In 2024, more than 322,353 Idahoans received Medicaid support, including three out of every eight children, according to KFF, a nonprofit health group. The reliance on Medicaid is especially high in rural Idaho where a quarter of citizens rely on the program. 
Congress also has plans to cut Medicaid payments to public schools, which are used to provide mental health support and other support for students. This will especially affect Idaho where we have one of the highest youth suicide rates in the country, according to Mental Health America.
But the Trump-GOP Congress plan will not just impact vulnerable Idahoans and other citizens. It will drive up the federal budget deficit by trillions of dollars, according to the independent Tax Foundation. The added interest on that debt will reduce the standard of living for Americans by at least one percent, offsetting part of the tax cut benefits, the Tax Foundation said.  
To make matters worse, the Trump administration and Congress are looking to provide a $5 billion dollar-for-dollar tax credit for high income taxpayers to provide vouchers for private and religious schools. This voucher program will not only increase the federal deficit and provide an attractive tax shelter for high income taxpayers, but it will also undermine our already underfunded public schools in Idaho by providing a federal subsidy to competing private and religious schools.
One proposal is to reduce federal matching funds for states that have expanded their Medicaid programs to support working families who can’t afford health care on limited paychecks. In Idaho, 90,000 Idahoans receive health care under the Medicaid expansion program approved by voters a few years ago.
Amid protests and Democratic pushback, U.S. House GOP launches work on Medicaid cuts

If federal funding for Medicaid expansion is reduced and the state doesn’t pick up the added cost, these 90,000 Idahoans could lose their health insurance. If that happens, uninsured Idahoans would be one serious illness or accident away from financial ruin.
Moreover, the only place uninsured Idahoans could go for care is to the emergency room at local hospitals which would double or even triple the cost of their care. In the view of one Idaho health leader, such a scenario would be financially “catastrophic” for Idaho hospitals, especially in rural communities where so many Medicaid recipients live.
One idea is to require all Medicaid recipients to work. But a study by KFF shows that most recipients already work. 
The political challenge Republican members of Congress face is that up to 25 million Republicans are on Medicaid, according to KFF. Former Trump adviser Steve Bannon was quoted in The Washington Post as saying that “a lot of MAGA’s on Medicaid.” Even House Speaker Mike Johnson has one of the highest percentages of constituents on public health insurance, according to the Post.
Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley wrote in The New York Times this week that it would be political suicide for Republicans to cut Medicaid. He said the party would be responsible for the closure of rural hospitals that could not survive the cuts or the added expense of treating people in their emergency rooms. He warned that it would “represent the end of any chance of us becoming the working-class party.” 
Meanwhile, you wouldn’t know it because he doesn’t advertise it, but Idaho’s own senior Sen. Mike Crapo, who chairs the powerful Senate Finance Committee, will be a key player in what the final tax and spending cut bill looks like. On May 9, Politico quoted Crapo as saying he has concerns about cutting Medicaid and SNAP programs. 
“I’m not excited about the proposal, but I have to say, there are a number of people in both the House and the Senate who are, and if the president weighs in favor of it, then that’s going to be a big factor that we have to take into consideration as well,” Crapo said in an interview with talk show host Hugh Hewitt, according to Politico.
Politico said Crapo has been an outspoken advocate for essentially writing off the cost of permanently extending the tax cuts and accounting only for any new tax provisions. That is surprising since Crapo has made a career of calling for reducing the federal budget deficit. 
What Idahoans need to know in this complicated dance over tax and budget cuts is this: Half or more of the tax cuts will benefit more economically affluent taxpayers and most of the budget cuts will be on the backs of low-income Americans, including thousands in Idaho.
Furthermore, the “big, beautiful bill,” as President Trump describes it, will do nothing to reduce the $36 trillion-dollar federal debt. In fact, it is likely to make the deficit even bigger, leaving the mess for our kids and grandkids to clean up someday. 
All so the most affluent taxpayers can receive a “big, beautiful” tax cut.

(Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)The Arkansas Board of Corrections on Thursday chose a partnership between Arkansas and Kansas City-based firms to build a proposed new 3,000-bed prison.
In a special-called meeting via videoconference, the seven-member board unanimously accepted the recommendation of its selection committee to negotiate a final contract with the partnership of Nabholz Construction of Conway and J.E. Dunn Construction of Kansas City, Missouri. Board Chairman Benny Magness said he expects to appoint a negotiating team by the board’s regular meeting on May 29.
The choice of a general contractor for the new prison marks the latest step in getting the prison off the ground since Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced in March 2023 her intent to have the state build the mega-prison. Last October, the prison board hired California-based Vanir Construction Management as project manager for the prison. In April, the board chose Omaha, Neb.-based HDR and Little Rock-based Cromwell Architects Engineers as the design team for the 3,000-bed facility.
Nabholz and J.E. Dunn both have extensive experience constructing correctional facilities, their representatives said Thursday. Dunn built a 2,552-bed prison in Tennessee that took 16 months to finish and was completed in 2015, according to its website. Nabholz has a 30-year history of working on Department of Corrections projects, said Jon Pahl, vice president of preconstruction.
Board members were careful Thursday not to specify where the prison will be located; the motion to approve the contractor said only that the firms would be hired for “the new prison build.”

The planned prison became controversial last fall when Sanders announced on Oct. 31 that the state was buying 815 acres in rural Franklin County for $2.95 million on which to place the prison. Local officials and some lawmakers cried foul, saying they had been “blindsided” by the decision. At least two citizen groups formed to voice objections to the site because of its remote location, which they said would make it difficult and expensive to provide adequate infrastructure and staffing.
A bill to appropriate $750 million toward the prison project stalled in the last days of the General Assembly last month as lawmakers voiced concerns about the ultimate cost and continued to raise questions about the suitability of the Franklin County location. Administration officials provided an estimated cost of the project of $825 million, but opponents said it could cost upward of $1 billion.
In a letter to Sanders the day the legislative session ended this month, Sen. Bryan King, R-Green Forest, asked the governor to use previously appropriated prison funds for their originally intended purpose —expanding the prison at Calico Rock — and taking other steps to increase state prison capacity instead of sticking to the Franklin County proposal.
King was accompanied at a press conference that day by about 20 opponents of the west Arkansas prison site as well as members of the Chickamauga, an Indigenous tribe with a presence in Franklin County. Tribal officials called for an archaeological study before construction begins because of potential artifacts and burial sites in the area. The state hasn’t committed to a formal study but has said it is conducting an assessment of the site for potential archaeological evidence.
The prison board took care of other matters at Thursday’s special meeting, including approving the purchase of 23 TruNarc drug-testing devices for $822,000. The corrections department has been using one of the devices and sharing among its facilities. An official said it is more accurate than previous drug-testing methods.
The board also approved the purchase of 70 new Arkansas Wireless Information Network two-way radios to replace older ones at a cost of $166,000 and 10 zero-turn mowers for $107,000.

Though Democrats hold solid majorities in both the state Senate and the House of Representatives, measures backed by progressive lawmakers to protect workers from extreme heat and to prohibit the use of surveillance-based algorithms to set wages were among the bills that died in the face of opposition from moderates.
The session’s biggest priority for labor groups, a bill aimed at making it easier for workers to unionize, made it through both chambers of the Legislature but is expected to be vetoed by Democratic Gov. Jared Polis at the behest of business groups. The party’s progressive and moderate wings clashed over several other proposals, including a bitter fight over changes to tipped minimum wage laws.
Here are the major labor bills lawmakers enacted before adjourning their regular legislative session on May 7.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Worker Protection Act
Senate Bill 25-5 would repeal the state’s Labor Peace Act, a 1943 law that erected a unique obstacle to workers seeking to form a union in Colorado.
Under the law, unionizing workers, after winning a simple majority vote to form a union, must hold a second election and obtain 75% approval to negotiate so-called union security — a requirement that all represented workers pay dues, even if they don’t support the union. The Labor Peace Act is effectively a modified version of the so-called “right to work” rules enacted by many conservative states.
Democratic majorities in the Legislature approved SB-5, dubbed the Worker Protection Act. But Polis said earlier this year that he would only sign the bill if it met the approval of business groups like the Colorado Chamber of Commerce. When talks between the two sides stalled, lawmakers passed SB-5 anyway.
Polis has indicated he will veto the bill. He has until June 6 to do so. Labor leaders have vowed to revive the Worker Protection Act next year.
Local tipped minimum wages
As originally introduced, House Bill 25-1208 would have meant steep wage cuts for tipped workers in Denver and Boulder, forcing those cities to dramatically increase their “tip credits” — the dollar amount that employers can subtract from the minimum wage paid to tipped workers, as long as tips make up the difference.
The bill’s sponsors, Denver Democratic Reps. Steven Woodrow and Alex Valdez, pitched the wage cuts as necessary relief for a struggling restaurant industry. But they backed off that plan after intense pushback from labor and progressive groups and a series of long, contentious committee hearings at the Capitol.
Instead, the amended version of HB-1208 would allow, but not require, local governments to increase their tip credits. In theory, a local government could raise the minimum wage for non-tipped employees as high as it wished, while maintaining a tipped minimum wage of $11.79 an hour, the statewide minimum.
Polis has not yet taken action on the bill.
Wage theft crackdown
House Bill 25-1001 would make a variety of changes aimed at combating wage theft, including raising the cap on wage-theft claims from $7,500 to $13,000, streamlining the process of adjudicating claims and increasing penalties on employers for repeated and “willful violations” of the law.
“Colorado workers lose hundreds of millions of dollars per year in wages due to theft from bad-acting employers,” Sen. Chris Kolker, a Centennial Democrat and HB-1001 sponsor, said in a statement on the bill’s passage. “With this legislation, Colorado’s labor force would more quickly and easily access their owed wages so they are fairly compensated for the work they do.”
The bill was approved by Democrats on party-line votes in the House and Senate. Polis has yet to take action on the bill.
Rollback of farmworker protections
Senate Bill 25-128 would repeal a provision in state law guaranteeing access by “key service providers” — including medical personnel, attorneys, legal advocates and clergy — to farmworkers on private agricultural properties during off hours. That protection was passed by Democratic majorities in the Legislature in 2021 as part of a larger piece of legislation known as the Farmworkers Bill of Rights.
Sponsors, including Democratic Sen. Dylan Roberts of Avon and Republican Sen. Byron Pelton of Sterling, said the “cleanup bill” was needed after a 2021 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that found a similar access provision enacted in California unconstitutional. The bill would leave intact the vast majority of the wide-ranging 2021 farmworkers’ rights measure.
Some farmworker advocates opposed SB-128, arguing the law’s protections for health care provider access weren’t covered by the Supreme Court ruling and should be left in place. The bill passed with bipartisan support, with a handful of progressive Democrats in both chambers opposed. Polis has not yet taken action on it.
Prohibiting non-compete agreements for medical workers
Senate Bill 25-83 would extend Colorado’s prohibition on “restrictive employment agreements,” including non-solicitation and non-compete agreements, to cover physicians, dentists and advanced practice nurses.
Those professions would no longer be included in the category of “highly compensated workers” that are exempted from the non-compete ban under current law. Bipartisan majorities in the Legislature approved SB-83, with a handful of Republicans opposed.
Polis has yet to take action on the bill.

The historic preservation office handles Ohio listings on the National Register of Historic Places, historic preservation tax incentives, and maintains a permanent record of Ohio’s historic buildings and sites, in addition to many other responsibilities.
The Ohio History Connection, which oversees the preservation office, laid off 12 of its employees because it hasn’t received $1.448 million from the National Park Service despite the fact that the money was appropriated on Oct. 1, said Neil Thompson, the history connection’s manager of media and public relations.
In a note to history connection staff last week, Executive Director and CEO Megan Wood said the preservation office couldn’t maintain its staffing without the money.
“As a reminder, roughly 60% of (the preservation office’s) funding comes from the federal Historic Preservation Fund — administered by the National Park Service and supported by proceeds from offshore oil and gas leases,” Wood wrote. “Although these funds were appropriated for the current federal fiscal year beginning October 1, 2024, they have not yet been released.
“We have been working tirelessly with the Governor’s Office, our Board, and Ohio’s Congressional Delegation to advocate for the timely release of these funds. However, with the majority of our (historic preservation) budget allocated to personnel, we are unable to sustain our current staffing levels without this federal support.”
In 1966, Congress passed the National Historic Preservation Act after years of mass demolition of historic sites and buildings.
“By the mid-1960s, federally-funded infrastructure and urban renewal projects had resulted in the rapid destruction of places significant in the nation’s history,” the National Park Service says on its website. “Congress recognized that the federal government’s historic preservation program was inadequate to ensure that future generations could appreciate and enjoy the rich heritage of the nation. (The National Historic Preservation Act) was enacted in recognition that historic places were being lost or altered, and that preservation was in the public’s interest.”
Among the things created under the law was the National Register of Historic Places, on which Columbus’s German Village has been listed since 1974.
Workers in state preservation offices evaluate whether nominees make the register. Those decisions depend on how old they are, their historical significance, their architectural significance, and other factors, Thompson said.
“It’s a federal program — a federal list that is ultimately put out by the Department of the Interior — but the State Historic Preservation Office is responsible for reviewing nominations to ensure all these factors are met,” Thompson said.
A more complete description of the preservation office’s responsibilities can be found here.
Some developers and homeowners might balk at historic preservation requirements, but historic preservation is popular with the public. For example, a 2014 UCLA survey found that “88% of respondents believe that historic places should be treated as community assets… (and) 83% of respondents indicated that historic preservation is somewhat to very important.”
The agency has been buffeted with cuts and threats of more since Trump took office and put the world’s richest man in charge of cutting government services.
In February, 1,000 probationary employees were cut from the park service and another 700 took buyouts. Now the Trump administration is planning to cut 1,500 more. The cuts already are said to have sewn chaos at the agency.
“Pending financial assistance obligations, including grants, are under review for compliance with recent executive orders and memoranda,” the park service said Wednesday in an email. “We will be happy to provide you with an update when we have additional information to share.”
Despite the loss of personnel at Ohio’s State Historic Preservation Office, officials plan to continue doing what the law requires.
“Despite this setback, we remain responsible for fulfilling our federally mandated duties, including the administration of the National Register of Historic Places, the Federal Historic Tax Credit program, and compliance reviews under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act,” Wood, CEO of the History Connection, told employees.
“We know the coming months will be challenging, and that extended processing times may occur as we adjust to these changes. Nonetheless, we remain committed to our mission and to serving the people and communities of Ohio through the preservation of our shared heritage.”

(Getty Images)Provisional data shows that overdose deaths in West Virginia declined by an astonishing 43.5% in the last year. Nationally, overdose deaths fell 27% over the same period, the largest one-year decline ever. While researchers are still analyzing the data, declines in overdose deaths have coincided with increased Medicaid coverage for substance use disorder treatment, with West Virginia leading the way in using Medicaid and the federal dollars it brings into the state to address our people’s needs and improve overdose outcomes. But those gains will be stalled or even reversed if the Medicaid provisions in Congress’ reconciliation package are made law — taking away the most effective tool we have to save lives and help our people recover from tens of thousands of West Virginians. 
Medicaid funding plays a critical role in West Virginia’s efforts to treat substance use disorder and prevent overdose deaths. The Mountain State was the first in the nation to receive approval under the Trump Administration in 2017 to use flexibilities within the Medicaid program to provide substance use treatment. Now, Medicaid is the main source of health coverage for opioid use disorder, covering more than half of all adults receiving medication for opioid use disorder and two-thirds of those receiving outpatient treatment and peer support services.
The Medicaid expansion, the portion of the program that is most directly under threat in the proposal moving through Congress, has given many West Virginians who struggle with addiction their first real opportunity to access the treatment they need. Nearly three-fourths of West Virginians who receive treatment for substance use disorder are covered through the Medicaid expansion, and one study found that, even after controlling for other policies to address substance use disorder, expansion states have seen a much larger reduction in overdose deaths (9.5%) than non-expansion states. 
The Medicaid proposals currently under consideration in Congress would dramatically reduce access to treatment for those who need it most and undermine the historic progress made over the last year. 
They increase paperwork, red tape and out-of-pocket costs that will result in many adults, including those with substance use disorder, losing their health coverage. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office estimates  more than 10 million Americans would be kicked off Medicaid if this package were enacted, with a separate analysis estimating 55,000 here in West Virginia. 
One piece, implementing work reporting requirements, would kick some adults off Medicaid if they do not submit proof showing they are working or qualify for an exemption, even though the vast majority of West Virginians do fall under one of those categories. Work requirements pose a particular challenge for adults with substance use disorder, for whom being in active treatment is often a prerequisite for them to secure work. And while the legislative proposal instructs that adults who are considered medically frail, which includes having a chronic substance use disorder, should be exempt from these requirements, proving one qualifies for an exemption is also a complex multi-step process that often results in eligible people losing coverage. Time spent on reporting compliance takes away from therapy compliance, creating a new barrier to recovery. 
Another component of the legislation would require states to impose cost-sharing on Medicaid expansion adults that could be as high as $35 per service. Research shows that co-pays cause individuals who need care to forgo it. Applying such a disincentive to ongoing treatment for individuals with chronic conditions like substance use disorder would undermine our health goals and could result in backsliding on recovery.
Each of these policies result in people losing their health coverage, not because they fail to meet the requirements, but because the new paperwork and multi-step processes are confusing, burdensome, and difficult to follow. When Arkansas implemented Medicaid work reporting requirements for a short period in 2018, one-quarter of those subject to the new requirements lost their health coverage in the first six months alone, despite the fact that researchers found nearly everyone who lost their coverage was working or should have received an exemption. Regardless, a substantial portion of the population had difficulty navigating the process so complex researchers found that, if left in place, 97% of enrollees would be deemed ineligible over time for failing to meet paperwork requirements. 
Medicaid — and the Medicaid expansion specifically — is the strongest tool in our arsenal to address substance use disorder. Over the last year, those investments have shown significant progress with the largest decline in overdose deaths in history, with West Virginia leading the way. Cuts to Medicaid like those Congress is currently considering would undermine that progress, hurt West Virginia families and cost lives.",https://westvirginiawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Medicaid-scaled-1-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-16 06:01:45.425976

This story originally appeared in Stateline.
Local sheriffs are on the front lines in deciding whether to participate in the Trump administration’s mass deportation plans. But states increasingly are making the choice for them.
More and more, sheriffs’ hands are tied no matter whether they do — or don’t — want to help with deportations, though they often get the blame when conservatives draw up lists of sanctuary cities.
“‘Naughty lists,’ as we call them, are not super helpful here,” said Patrick Royal, a spokesperson for the National Sheriffs’ Association. “We all know there are places like Colorado where you can’t (help with deportations), and places like North Carolina where you have to.”
Cooperation between sheriffs and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement lies at the heart of the Trump administration’s immigration detention policy. The administration plans to punish noncooperative jurisdictions with funding cuts — though many legal experts agree that cooperation is voluntary unless state or local laws say otherwise.

Sheriffs, who typically run local jails, must decide what to do when faced with immigration detainers — requests from ICE to hold onto incarcerated people up to two extra days so ICE officers can show up and arrest them. ICE issues those detainers when the agency reviews fingerprints sent electronically for background checks as part of the jail booking process.
Otherwise, arrested suspects who post bond or are otherwise released by a judge might go free despite their immigration status, prompting ICE in some cases to pursue them in the community.
In North Carolina, Sheriff Garry McFadden ran on a platform of limiting cooperation with ICE  when he was elected in Mecklenburg County, home to Charlotte, in 2018. But today, McFadden must comply with detainers because of a state law passed last year.
In a now-retracted Facebook post, U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis in late April accused Mecklenburg and several other North Carolina counties of “shielding criminal illegal immigrants” as sanctuary jurisdictions. Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, said in the post he was writing federal legislation to prosecute sanctuary jurisdictions.
“You can’t say we’re a sanctuary county and have state laws that say we have to work with ICE. You can’t have both,” McFadden said. He added that he’d like more choice about whether to comply with detainers. A federal funding cutoff would endanger important jail programs such as rape counseling, he said.
“Everybody’s focused on immigration like that’s the biggest fire, and nobody wants to address the other things. The losers will be the prisoners who need all these services we provide,” McFadden said.










You can’t say we’re a sanctuary county and have state laws that say we have to work with ICE. You can’t have both.


– Sheriff Garry McFadden, Mecklenburg County, N.C.


Conservative sheriffs in Democratic-controlled states also can be frustrated by state policy on detainers. Sheriff Lew Evangelidis of Worcester County, Massachusetts, said he’s been criticized for releasing prisoners wanted by ICE but sometimes has no choice: A 2017 state Supreme Court ruling prohibits holding prisoners based on detainers.
“If (ICE wants) this person and consider them a threat to public safety, then I want that person out of my community. I want to keep my community safe,” said Evangelidis. He supported a Republican-sponsored effort in the state legislature to allow 12-hour holds for ICE if a judge determines the prisoner is a threat to public safety, but the amendment was voted down in April.
States act on detainers
Many experts agree that ICE detainers can be legally ignored if states allow sheriffs to do that.
“That detainer request is just that, a request, it’s not a requirement,” said Cassandra Charles, a staff attorney at the National Immigration Law Center, which is opposing Louisiana’s lawsuit to reverse a court-ordered ban on cooperation between Orleans Parish and ICE.
The general counsel for the North Carolina Sheriffs’ Association, Eddie Caldwell, agreed that the detainers are voluntary under federal law.
Trump orders list of ‘sanctuary cities’ to target for funding freeze

The association supports a state bill now under consideration that would require not only the 48-hour detention but also a notice sent 48 hours before release to let ICE know the clock is running. The proposal has passed the House.
The notification matters, Caldwell said, because there can be criminal proceedings that take weeks or months, so ICE in many cases doesn’t realize the 48-hour window has started.
Tillis’ office said the senator’s disagreement with McFadden, a Democrat, and other sheriffs is about that notification.
“It’s not necessarily that (sheriffs) are breaking the law, but rather making it as difficult as possible for ICE to take prisoners into custody by refusing to do some basic things. Notification is important,” said Daniel Keylin, a senior adviser to Tillis.
States including California, Colorado and Massachusetts ban compliance with the ICE detainers, on the general principle that it’s not enough reason to hold people in jails when they’re otherwise free to go because of bail or an end to their criminal cases. Those three states have made recent moves to defend or fine-tune their rules.
California’s attorney general also has issued guidance to local jurisdictions based on a 2017 state law limiting cooperation with immigration authorities. That law withstood a court challenge under the first Trump administration.
Colorado has a law against holding prisoners more than six hours longer than required, and a new bill sent to Democratic Gov. Jared Polis last week would specify that even those six hours can’t be for the purpose of an immigration detainer.
Iowa, Tennessee and Texas are among the states requiring cooperation with detainers.
And Florida has gone further, requiring sheriffs to actively help ICE write detainers though official agreements in which local agencies sign up to help enforce immigration laws.
Cooperation boosts arrests
Such cooperation makes a big difference, experts say — jails are the easiest place to pick up immigrants for deportation, and when local sheriffs and police help out, there are more arrests.
“A larger share of ICE arrests and deportations are happening in places where local law enforcement is cooperative with ICE,” said Julia Gelatt, associate director for the Migration Policy Institute’s U.S. Immigration Policy Program, speaking at a recent webinar.
“A declining share of arrests and deportations are happening from places like California, where there are really strict limitations on local law enforcement’s cooperation with ICE,” she added.
ICE is making about 600 immigration arrests daily, twice the rate as during the last year of the Biden administration, said Muzaffar Chishti, an attorney and policy expert at the Migration Policy Institute, speaking at the same event.
Reports on deportations are incomplete, Chishti said, but he estimated the current administration is on track to deport half a million people this year and is trying to get that number higher.
“The Trump administration has not been able to change the laws that are on the books, because only Congress can do that,” Chishti said. “It’s going to take congressional action for the Trump administration to achieve its aim of higher (arrest and deportation) numbers.”
President Donald Trump has added more pressure, last month requesting a list from Attorney General Pam Bondi and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem of sanctuary cities, which he says would face funding cuts. The administration also has sued some states, including Colorado, Illinois and New York, over their policies.
Asked for comment on the legality of funding cutoffs for sanctuary policies, Bondi’s office referred to a February memo in which she promised to “end funding to state and local jurisdictions that unlawfully interfere with federal law enforcement operations.” The memo cites a federal law saying local officials “may not prohibit, or in any way restrict” communication about immigration status.
Local jurisdictions in Connecticut, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon and Washington joined a February lawsuit led by the city and county of San Francisco and Santa Clara County in California against a Trump administration executive order calling for defunding cities with sanctuary policies, calling the order “illegal and authoritarian.”
In April, a U.S. district court in California issued a preliminary injunction in that case preventing any funding cutoff over sanctuary policies to the cities and counties in the lawsuit. And on Friday, the federal judge, William Orrick, ruled that the injunction applies to any list of sanctuary jurisdictions the administration may target for funding cuts.
Trump’s new executive order seeking the list cannot be used as “an end run” around Orrick’s injunction, the judge wrote, while he decides the legality of detainer policies and other issues.
“The litigation may not proceed with the coercive threat to end all federal funding hanging over the Cities and Counties’ heads like the sword of Damocles,” Orrick wrote.

(Courtesy: U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission)As New Jersey-Based Holtec International works its way toward restarting the Palisades Nuclear Plant in West Michigan, a host of organizations are challenging regulator’s findings that reviving the reactor would not bring significant harm to the environment. 
The Palisades restart marks the first effort of its kind in the United States, with the federal government awarding the effort a $1.5 billion loan alongside $150 million in state funding to bring the facility back online. 
However the effort is not without its detractors, as some environmental organizations have argued against providing state funding for the effort, while other organizations have opposed the plant over safety and environmental concerns. 
In a virtual hearing Thursday morning, attorneys representing Beyond Nuclear, Don’t Waste Michigan, Michigan Safe Energy Future, Three Mile Island Alert, and Nuclear Energy Information Services asked a panel Atomic Safety and Licensing Board panel to accept a motion allowing them to file new and updated contentions. Those contentions argue the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission erred when it issued a finding of no significant impact for the project, allowing it to forgo a full review of environmental impacts.
“The position of the [Nuclear Regulatory Commission] staff seems to be that, since the plant was operable in May 2022 that simply a return to operability means that there are no significant environmental impacts,” said Wallace Taylor, an attorney representing the anti-nuclear groups, arguing that the environmental analysis should have come from a perspective of retooling, recalibrating and restarting a dormant facility.

The Commission issued a draft of its findings in January, where it outlined the purpose and need reviving the facility would serve, the level of environmental review needed and provided a description of the plant, any potential alternatives, and the various ways it could impact the environment. 
The environmental assessment cites Michigan’s standard for 100% clean energy by 2040, which includes provisions for nuclear energy and natural gas with 90% effective carbon capture technology in justifying the need for the project. It also argues the facility will enhance electrical reliability in the state by generating consistent, carbon-free energy and reducing the state’s reliance on imported energy sources. 
Although the commission reviewed alternatives like replacing the current reactor with a new reactor; replacing the reactor with other alternatives like natural gas, solar and wind; and using alternative system designs with the current reactor, it only provided further analysis for a no-action alternative, where it would deny the authorizations needed to bring Palisades back online. 
After reviewing a number of potential concerns, commission staff ultimately concluded the project would have no significant environmental impacts, and that choosing not to grant the authorizations Holtec needs to operate the plant would violate the purpose and need of the project: meeting clean energy demand. 
Terry Lodge, also representing the groups challenging the review, contended that the purpose of need statement was flawed, arguing it presents a restart of the plant as the only viable option without offering any justification or explanation of the demand for power. 
Lodge and Taylor also argued the limited consideration of alternatives to the plant was similarly problematic. 
“I think that it’s pretty obvious that renewable energy would have a lessened environmental impact than a nuclear plant, which would require uranium mining, which would require something to be done with the radioactive waste. There’s radioactive material, like tritium, for example, that comes from nuclear plants, and all of that would have to be considered to have a really appropriate discussion in the [environmental analysis], and that wasn’t done,” Taylor said. 
Lodge further contended that the impact of the project remains unclear, as Holtec is still working to identify whether it needs to replace key components of the reactor, like steam generators, arguing the environmental effects of the restart are not yet known and quantified.
While justifying their findings, commission staff explained that the purpose and needs statement is used to determine the range of alternatives considered within the assessment. 
Anita Naber, representing the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, explained that the alternatives analysis is intended to determine whether there are other options available or environmentally preferable alternatives.
She later explained that while developing a purpose and need statement for their environmental analysis, staff members give substantial weight to the goals and needs of an applicant, in line with both the commission’s policy and case law. 
“The staff will look at the applicant’s purpose and need and the factual background and information that’s submitted by the applicant in support of that purpose and need and evaluate that. And that’s what the staff did for the Palisades restart environmental assessment,” Naber said. 
In offering their closing arguments to the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, the plant’s opponents emphasized that an environmental impact should have been required for the project since the beginning, and would have required a much more in-depth analysis of alternatives.

However, members of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Holtec argued that the contentions filed by the opposing groups should be denied, as they were not responding to new information as required by the commission’s rules. Naber also noted that the commission expects petitioners to file contentions on the basis of an applicant’s environmental report rather than delaying them until after the staff issues its environmental analysis. 
“To have their contentions admitted for hearing, petitioners must demonstrate some sort of genuine factual or legal dispute with the staff draft [environmental analysis], which they have not done. They also need to provide actual fact or expert support for their assertion, but they have not done this either,” Naber said. 
On rebuttal, Lodge argued that the Commission’s rules allow petitioners to file new or amended contentions based on a draft or final environmental impact statement, environmental assessment or any supplements to those documents. 
“We timely and we believe properly under this section amended our contentions,” Lodge said, arguing their updated contentions should not be excluded as a result. 
The panel will take the matter under consideration and will determine whether to accept the opposition’s updated contentions.

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)Let us begin with the word “scum.”
One potential GOP candidate for the soon-to-be-vacated U.S. Senate seat of Mitch McConnell is 44-year-old Nate Morris, a technology entrepreneur from Lexington. In a recent Breitbart interview, as reported by Austin Horn of the Lexington Herald-Leader, Morris recounted an interaction he said he had with a wealthy McConnell donor during the Kentucky Derby earlier this month. “I said, ‘Let me tell you something: Mitch McConnell is scum.’”
In announcing his candidacy for McConnell’s seat, Republican Andy Barr, 51, said, “The woke left wants to neuter America, literally.” We can assume Barr meant figuratively, but this sort of talk can inspire real acts of violence by those who take it literally.
When asked during a KET panel this week about the president’s statement that he doesn’t know if he needs to obey the Constitution, Kentucky’s GOP communications director Andy Westberry pivoted to chastising Democrats for “fear-mongering” and pearl-clutching.
Kentucky communications professional Scott Jennings, age 47 and the most prominent GOP commentator on CNN, recently stood on stage at a rally with the president and said, “Michigan, we were flying in here today, and I said look at these farms. I got to get a farm in Michigan, because when you own as many libs as I do, you gotta get a place to put ’em all.” Later, Jennings posted on X that he got “caught up in the moment” with a sideways laughing emoji.
Is this how grown men, professional men, speak now in the commonwealth?
We hear much (and rightly so) about how American boys feel isolated and angry, that they are growing up in the age of outrage; of 24/7 cell phones and internet and social media; of the damage being done due to the lack of common decency and good role models. 
And yet the above are everyday examples of the kind of sneering, childish, mean-spirited, petty behavior we see regularly from grown men in power and public service.
On May 10, I talked privately with a pastor about the damage social media, the tech bros (like Elon Musk) and podcast bros (like Joe Rogan and Ben Shapiro) are doing to our kids, about the ripping down of decency and civility in families and among neighbors. One reason cited for folks no longer going to church: They are so hurt and dispirited by what they see family members and neighbors post on Facebook, X and Instagram — yes, much of it about politics — that they don’t want to see them in church where they will have to shake hands and smile and pretend they haven’t seen what they’ve seen. So they just stay home.
When writer Zadie Smith reviewed the 2010 movie “The Social Network” about the founding of Facebook, she wrote, “When a human being becomes a set of data on a Web site like Facebook, he or she is reduced. Everything shrinks. Individual character. Friendships. Language. Sensibility.  … Our denuded networked selves don’t look more free, they just look more owned.” 
Just once, I would like to write about Kentucky politics without mentioning the current president at all, as I find him boringly repetitive. This is impossible. Not because I am obsessed with him but because GOP politicians and political operatives in our state are tripping over each other to win his approval and endorsement as though his gaze is all that matters. 
To quote Smith, they just look more owned.
GOP candidates do not use their TV appearances and social media to present policy ideas; they post and preen with the singular, embarrassingly desperate hope that the president will notice them frantically waving from the back of the room — Pick me! Pick me! — and make them the winner they think they can’t be without him.
In addition to calling him “scum,”’Nate Morris recently said about McConnell — a man Kentuckians have elected to the Senate for almost as long as Morris has been alive — that he  “completely pulled his pants down for President Biden” when negotiating.
When asked on KET about the president’s potential abuse of the legal system — ignoring the right of habeas corpus, for instance — Andy Westberry said flatly to former Democratic Congressman John Yarmuth, “well, you all started it.” A 9-year-old in the backseat of his parents’ car comes to mind.
And Scott Jennings — also rumored to be considering a run for McConnell’s seat — has a book coming out with a title casting the president as the savior of Western Civilization, illustrating what happens when you’re a grown man who has to not only drink all of Dear Leader’s KoolAid but stir up a new pitcher and guzzle more than the other guys.
It is 2025. 
Kids are in crisis. Adults are in crisis. We need mature leaders.
But we now live in a world where the man whose name is on the Kentucky GOP headquarters is proudly called “scum” by his own party members, and the man who started his first presidency with the arrogant pledge that he can grab any woman he wants “by the pussy” is Kentucky’s GOP kingmaker. 
I have bad news. The Republicans who want to represent you in the U.S. Senate are engaged in a sophomoric, cage-match, hazing ritual, and the one on the ballot in 2026 will be the one willing to humiliate himself the most.

(Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)With bipartisan agreement that Maine’s property tax burden is too high, legislators are pushing for some tweaks to tax credits this year, however they’re holding off on substantial reform until a task force can study the issue. 
Among its work on 18 bills on Thursday, the Taxation Committee removed the policy changes from a bipartisan plan from legislative leadership to provide property tax relief. Instead, the committee members unanimously agreed the bill should be exclusively focused on the creation of a task force that would report back legislative recommendations starting next year.
“The truth of the matter is with 2,000 bills that we’re working in five months,” said co-chair Sen. Nicole Grohowski (D-Hancock), “I actually think taking a break and being able to focus on one thing for a period of time is the way we can get the best outcome for Maine people.” 
The Maine Legislature is approaching its expected final month of work for the first year of the two-year session and is overall considering dozens of bills that aim to reform property taxes. 
Some have received favorable votes from the Taxation Committee including on Thursday a plan to expand the Property Tax Fairness Credit. The committee also earlier advanced a proposal to increase the state’s tax exemption for homeowners and another to expand property tax relief for veterans and their survivors, with the latter passing both the Maine House of Representatives and Senate this week.  
The committee’s recommendations largely fell in line with the positions of Gov. Janet Mills’ administration, including committee members unanimously opposing on Thursday attempts to reinstate previously repealed programs related to property taxes.  
“We did take the time and really work the task force,” Rep. Shelley Rudnicki (R-Fairfield) said, referring to the several hours the committee spent Thursday morning hashing out the details of its composition and deadlines. “I think it makes sense right now to go that way rather than try to piecemeal things.”
Task force 
A bipartisan bill, LD 1770 sponsored by Senate President Mattie Daughtry (D-Brunswick) and co-sponsored by House Speaker Ryan Fecteau (D-Biddeford) and Senate Minority Leader Trey Stewart (R-Aroostook), among others, initially sought to both increase the property tax fairness credit and establish a Real Estate Property Tax Relief Task Force. 
The committee unanimously decided to advance an amended version of the bill that only included the latter, which now sets LD 1770 on a likely path to passage. The Mills administration had some concerns about the policy changes in LD 1770 given the tight budget year but was fully supportive of the task force component.
Stating that they’d like to wait for the recommendations from this task force for major reform, the committee unanimously rejected most of the other property tax bills it considered on Thursday. These included LDs 432, 1304, 1464, 1537, 1591, 1610, 1729 and 1798.
“We are taking all of this, all of this information, seriously,” said Rep. Tracy Quint (R-Hodgdon), “and that is why we are sending it over to the task force, because they can take the appropriate amount of time to see which bills can be properly worked and implemented.” 
Other lawmakers withdrew their own bills, including Rep. Steven Foster (R-Dexter) who withdrew LD 614, which sought to modify certain property tax assessment methods.
“I believe a long term answer to this problem requires much more than occasional increases to the Homestead exemption, tax credits, or other temporary fixes,” Foster said. “I think the task force and its work this bill would establish may provide that answer.”
Daughtry had outlined that the task force would be required to be geographically diverse and composed of legislators, economists, tax experts, real estate professionals and representatives of low-income and older residents. 
The committee added additional specifications, including that those representing low-income and older residents be people with that lived experience and that one member must represent municipalities with fewer than 10,000 residents and different forms of government — i.e. both cities and towns.
While the committee had wanted the task force to complete its work within the current 132nd Legislature, it ultimately compromised, given concerns about staff workload in light of changes on the federal level raised by Michael Allen, associate commissioner for Tax Policy in the Department of Administrative and Financial Services.
With the Republican majority in U.S. Congress pushing for a budget plan with new tax breaks, cuts to Medicaid and other programs, Maine state government will likely have to return to readjust state spending and operations once the details are finalized, Allen said. 
“That means we’re looking at conformity sometime in the middle of the summer of a very complicated bill, which is going to probably require this committee to come in to evaluate any proposal by the governor,” Allen said. “It may take two or three weeks just to figure out what exactly Congress did and its impact on state revenue.” 
Therefore, the committee agreed to have the task force issue an interim report in January 2026, but also have the ability to continue its work until December 2026, when a final report would be due. 
Rep. Gregory Lewis Swallow (R-Houlton) was alone in offering a different take on the task force. He thinks limiting it to only studying property taxes is too narrow.
“Everything is synergistic on this issue,” Swallow said. “When you deal with one tax, you’re dealing with another tax.”
Changes to existing credits 
The state has incrementally expanded the Property Tax Fairness Credit, the latest of which occurred last year. The credit allows taxpayers to receive back a portion of their property tax or rent paid during the tax year, with the value calculated by the degree to which the “base benefit” exceeds 4% four of a person’s annual income.
In the 2023 tax year, the state essentially returned just under $80 million to taxpayers through the credit and after the latest expansion the state has returned about $115 million to taxpayers in 2024, though that number may change as returns come in.  
Allen said 33,463 taxpayers have benefitted from the expansion, with an average tax cut of $678, including 7,672 people who would have earlier been ineligible. 
Another adjustment could be coming. 
The committee unanimously voted to advance LD 715, sponsored by Rep. Nina Azella Milliken (D-Blue Hill), which would allow for people over the age of 65 with an annual income of $36,000 or less to receive a credit equal to the amount by which the “base benefit” exceeds 3% of their annual income, a decrease from the current 4%.
Former state Rep. Ron Russell introduced this plan last session, and while his bill passed both chambers, it ultimately did not get funded. 
On the other hand, the committee voted 8-3 against LD 1665, sponsored by Sen. Anne Carney (D-Cumberland), which covered similar ground but with a wider scope. It proposed increasing the benefit base to varying levels based on age and number of children. 
The majority of the committee ultimately rejected the plan, with Grohowski and Quint agreeing that the state shouldn’t muddy the waters by adding another track for people with dependents to the property tax fairness credit when the state already has a specific child tax credit, which the committee has separately recommended be expanded.
Committee rejects efforts to bring back repealed programs 
Enacted in 2022, the Property Tax Stabilization Program allowed people 65 years old and over to freeze their property taxes at the previous year’s level regardless of income, as long as they owned a permanent residence for at least 10 years and were eligible to receive a homestead exemption. Mills allowed the law to take effect without her signature.  
However, the Legislature repealed that program after just one year in effect, following skyrocketing cost projections, concern about wealthy property owners taking advantage due to a lack of income restrictions and the administrative burden it left on municipalities.
The eligibility expansion for the Property Tax Fairness Credit and the creation of a Property Tax Deferral Program had been some of the ways lawmakers tried to soften the blow of this repeal last session. 
With unanimous votes among those present, the Taxation Committee rejected Republican proposals to reinstate the program, albeit with some changes aimed to address the program’s shortcomings.
LD 1481, sponsored by Rep. Wayne Parry (R-Arundel), would add income limits for eligibility, and LD 1541, sponsored by Sen. Joseph Martin (R-Oxford), would exempt all Mainers over 65 from property taxes. The latter bill is co-sponsored by Republican leaders, Sen. Trey Stewart of Aroostook and Rep. Billy Bob Faulkingham of Winter Harbor.  
“We should have fixed it,” Parry said of the program during a Wednesday press conference, “not gotten rid of it.”
In 2024, the Legislature repealed a law that limited the total levy that could be raised by a municipality via property taxes each year. LD 542, which is sponsored by Rep. Jeffrey Sean Adams (R-Lebanon), proposed reestablishing municipal property tax levy limits.
The State and Local Government Committee was split on the proposal and not along party lines. Six legislators voted for its passage, while six voted against it. The majority of the House opposed the bill on Tuesday, with a 79-62 vote against passage, and the Senate tabled it on Wednesday. 
Regardless of how the Legislature’s final votes come down, the Mills administration is also opposed to both bills, so they would likely get vetoed.

House of Representatives is now considering a radical budget and tax plan that would take health coverage and food assistance away from more than 100,000 Kentuckians, all to offset a fraction of the cost of cutting taxes for America’s wealthiest people and corporations. If passed, it would be the largest funding cut to both Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in history.
More than 1 in 3 Kentuckians use Medicaid to see a doctor or afford medicine, but the new House plan would make it harder to get, keep and use that health coverage. It includes:

Burdensome work reporting requirements that put 197,000 to 282,000 Kentuckians at risk of terminated health coverage for those caught up in new red tape.
Mandatory copays that would delay or prevent working class Kentuckians from getting needed care.
More frequent checks for eligibility leading to needless coverage-ending mistakes.
Cuts that make coverage options more expensive for those who purchase health insurance on kynect – adding thousands of dollars for many families.

SNAP, meanwhile, helps more than 575,000 Kentuckians afford their groceries. But this House plan would radically restructure the 50-year-old program by:

Increasing red-tape requirements that will kick older people and parents off the program, putting 135,000 Kentuckians at risk for the first time.
Shrinking SNAP by shifting up to $190 million in annual costs to the already-underfunded state budget, equal to the cost of hiring 2,354 Kentucky public school teachers.
Preventing future benefit changes to match updated nutrition standards or a rapid rise in cost of food, as we’ve all experienced recently.

As a state where so many people are able to receive medical care and put food on the table because of these federal programs, Kentucky would be left sicker, hungrier and poorer by these cruel and unnecessary changes. The cuts will pass huge new costs down to Kentucky’s budget, potentially squeezing out state investments in everything from education to infrastructure. And the cuts will weaken our economy as well, especially in rural Kentucky.
Medicaid keeps the doors open at many hospitals. Cuts that result in terminated coverage or less care threaten the jobs of nurses and providers across the state. At the same time, SNAP stimulates local economies and supports jobs at farmers’ markets and grocery stores. In 2024, more than $1.3 billion in federal SNAP benefits went to more than 4,700 retailers across the state. 
These cuts are being proposed in part because many politicians in Washington want to extend key parts of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy. The richest 1% in Kentucky would receive over $45,000 in annual tax cuts from those extensions, while the poorest 20% would get $70. The House bill also adds even more giveaways to the wealthy by further increasing the estate tax exemption, expanding the pass-through deduction loophole for super-rich investors, and creating a new tax credit for the exact kind of private school vouchers that Kentuckians roundly rejected in the Amendment 2 vote last year.
And that’s just some of the dangerous changes in this plan. The proposal also hurts immigrants and their U. S. citizen children, makes the cost of student loans go up and denies the full child tax credit for the very poorest kids who would benefit the most from the added income. It kills energy tax breaks that have helped fuel new jobs at battery plants and power installations all across Kentucky. 
Taken as a whole, the House plan is a recipe for greater hardship and the redistribution of wealth from hard-working Kentuckians and their kids to the pockets of the richest people in our country.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/guthriepallone-2214935790-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-16 06:01:45.425976

Fining, jailing or ticketing someone experiencing homelessness for unauthorized camping or sleeping outside will not solve the homelessness problem, said Whitehead, the event’s keynote speaker. He urged conference participants to fight against proposed legislation in North Carolina that would make unauthorized camping and sleeping illegal.

“I’m asking you today, before you leave this conference, call your representative in Washington, in the state House, make sure that North Carolina doesn’t become included in those communities that are criminalizing homelessness,” Whitehead said.
Whitehead was referring to House Bill 781, which is winding its way through the General Assembly. The bill would ban unauthorized camping and sleeping on public property and allow local governments by “majority vote” to designate local government-owned property to be used for a “continuous period of up to one year for public camping or sleeping purposes.” Local governments can renew the one-year period.
Whitehead shared that a 2014 study in Osceola, Florida found that 37 chronically homeless people were arrested approximately 1,250 times at a cost of more than $6 million to the community.
“We know, if you jail, fine or arrest somebody, it does not solve homelessness,” Whitehead said. “Criminalization is not the solution, but those are local decisions, and the only way we can have an impact on those local solutions, those local issues, is that we have to be advocates in our community beyond the service.”
Rep. Brian Biggs (R-Randolph), a cosponsor of HB 781 has pushed back against claims the bill criminalizes homelessness.
“This bill does not criminalize homelessness,” Biggs insisted. “It addresses unauthorized public property camping and sleeping without prohibiting homelessness itself.”
Biggs has said HB 781 grew out of conversations with municipal leaders who asked for guidance around handling the state’s growing homeless crisis. He said the state can no longer wait to address the problem.

Speaking just ahead of Whitehead on Thursday, Gov. Josh Stein also took aim at HB 781, contrasting it with bills introduced this session that are designed to increase affordable housing stock. Stein said lawmakers have put forward “many creative solutions” to address the state’s housing shortage, such as a proposal to allow developers to build new housing in any area zoned for commercial, retail or office use without having to rezone the property.
“They’re [lawmakers] thinking boldly about how we can increase housing supply, and this is certainly an issue where there is a possibility for bipartisan solutions,” Stein said. “On the other hand, we are seeing efforts at the General Assembly to make sleeping in a park a crime. No one should have to sleep outside. It’s a real problem, but we need to find real solutions by connecting people with supportive services and putting more roofs over more heads.”
Bans on authorized camping and sleeping are coming as the rate of homelessness is rising, Whitehead said.
“Last year, we had the highest number of people experiencing homelessness in the history of our country, at least since it’s been measured by Congress, which goes back to the early 2000s, over 770,000 people (an 18% increase over the previous year),” Whitehead said.
HUD’s 2024 Annual Homelessness Assessment Report (AHAR) found that the number of people experiencing homelessness increased in every category — except for veterans — measured during the department’s annual Point-in-Time (PIT) Count. The count is a snapshot of the number of individuals in shelters, temporary housing and unsheltered on a single night.
The Founding Fathers in the Preamble to the Constitution promised U.S. citizens life, liberty and pursuit of happiness, Whitehead said.
“You can’t pursue happiness sleeping under a bridge,” Whitehead said. “There is no liberty when you are fined, jailed or ticketed because you can’t afford a place to live. You cannot pursue happiness if you lay your head in the back of an automobile.”
State advocates for people experiencing homelessness contend HB 781 will diminishes local autonomy while making cities and counties both fiscally responsible and legally liable for the implementing state-sanctioned encampment policies. The NC Coalition to End Homelessness (NCCEH) has also expressed concern that the proposal is being pushed by the Cicero Institute, a conservative think tank, that has led efforts to pass similar legislation in Arizona, Missouri, Tennessee, Iowa, Georgia, Florida, Wisconsin and Kentucky.

The institute was founded by tech-industry capitalist Joe Lonsdale, who is critical of the “housing first” approach to ending homelessness. That model prioritizes providing individuals and families with permanent, affordable housing as the first step in ending their plight.
“While Cicero describes itself as a think tank, its policies promote industries that potentially profit from criminalizing poverty,” said Dr. Latonya Agard, executive director of NCCEH. Agard said Cicero’s policies promote industries that will potentially profit from criminalizing poverty. “States that adopted Cicero laws find they are funneling more public money into incarceration, so while these bills could lead to the financial enrichment of out-of-state investors of privatized jails and prisons and monitoring technologies, they will worsen conditions for North Carolinians without housing,” Agard said.
Both Stein and Whitehead expressed concerns about proposed federal budget cuts to eliminate Section 8 housing.
“More than 25,000 people in North Carolina depend on Section 8 to have a home they can’t afford to have that support taken away from them, and we cannot afford it either,” Stein said. “Let’s work to expand access to housing, not take it away.”
Stein said he’s also concerned about proposed cuts to Medicaid and the SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.) The SNAP program, once referred to as Food Stamps, provides low-income families with food for an adequate diet.
“These cuts pose a serious threat to the wallets and wellbeing of so many hard-working families here in North Carolina,” Stein said. “Cuts to essential needs like health care and food make it that much harder for people to afford housing, and they’ll make it even harder for our state to afford to support our people.”
Whitehead said the proposed cuts to the nation’s social safety net programs would push more people into homelessness and cause harm to those who are already unsheltered.
“If that budget goes through, it would be a devastating impact on people experiencing homelessness,” he said. “I don’t know who you voted for, but I don’t think you voted for an 80% reduction in HUD [U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development] staff or $1 trillion worth of cuts between Medicaid and the SNAP program — I don’t think that’s what you voted for — and all of that in order to be able to enact a $45 trillion tax cut, which benefits people at the top of the economic ladder.”

Devdutta Sangvai, the N.C. Secretary of Health and Human Services, said that in the coming days the proposed Medicaid and SNAP cuts will be widely discussed. Sangvai reminded conferences attendees that both are connected to housing.
“Behavioral Health is connected to housing. Housing is connected to child care. Child Care is connected to the economy,” Sangvai said. “We do not have to artificially connect the dots to make a point. It is proven. There are data out there to support that. And so we really need to understand that if we don’t address the homelessness issue in the housing crisis, it poses a direct threat to the stability and economic well being of North Carolina.”

(NPS staff/Peterson/Public domain)Forests are extremely valuable for watersheds, wildlife, carbon storage, recreation and so much more. The deceptively named Fix Our Forests Act, or FOFA, does nothing to conserve forests to retain these values. Instead, it would emphasize logging and otherwise manipulating forests at a scale we haven’t seen on public lands for many decades, if ever.
The misguided bill has already passed the House, and its Senate version was recently introduced by Colorado’s own U.S. Sen. John Hickenlooper and other Western senators. FOFA encourages the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management, which manage most of the federal lands in the Western U.S., to avoid a careful examination of impacts from logging and ways to reduce harms under the National Environmental Policy Act.
Under FOFA, projects up to 10,000 acres — over 15 square miles — would be excluded from consideration of possible impacts. The effects to watersheds, wildlife habitat, recreation and scenery would be massive. What’s more, the public would have only one chance to provide input for logging projects and could only object in court.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
If Fix Our Forests passes, agencies would no longer need to consult about their management plans with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service if new threatened or endangered species were listed or critical habitat was designated for them, or even if new information surfaced concerning what action was needed for their recovery to secure populations. This provision could lead to further harm to species already on the edge of continued existence.
The use of livestock grazing to reduce the risk of fire would be also encouraged. Grazing can be extremely harmful to fragile ecosystems, especially near streams and lakes. Stock can denude vegetation, leading to invasion by non-native species, such as cheatgrass, which burns easily and readily reestablishes itself after fires. Yet under FOFA, grazing could be used for “post-fire restoration and recovery,” in spite of adverse impacts.
Under recent direction from its Washington office, the U.S. Forest Service would be encouraged to use two methods of approving logging projects that would basically allow loggers to select which trees they want to cut and sell to mills. The largest trees, the ones most valuable for wildlife and storing carbon, would likely be taken. FOFA would even allow logging for the purpose of “retaining and expanding forest products infrastructure,” i.e., with no other goal than to benefit the logging industry by giving them logs off public lands at taxpayer expense.
In the bill, “high priority hazard trees” would be defined as those likely to fall, which could of course mean almost all trees in the forest. Areas up to 6,000 acres containing such trees within 300 feet of Forest Service roads could be cut with no consideration of impacts. Similarly, trees that could fall within 150 feet of a powerline could be cut with no assessment of possible impacts.
Science, much of it researched by the Forest Service, clearly shows the best way to protect houses and other infrastructure is by removing flammable material from the structures and an area no more than 100 feet surrounding them. Cutting our public forests will not protect our communities.
We don’t need to degrade and destroy forests to save our homes and infrastructure from fire. Our forests need more protection from harmful activities, not less, in order to retain the great benefits they provide for us and other species as well.

Federal fallout

	
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and
whether to make up the difference.
Read the latest > 


U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, said she had been awake over 36 hours by the time she joined a call with members of the media on Thursday to discuss GOP lawmakers’ plan to slash $625 billion in federal Medicaid funding over the next decade.
The lack of sleep didn’t disturb her, she said, but her Republican colleagues’ advancement of Medicaid overhaul proposals that could leave over 630,000 Virginians  and millions of Americans without health insurance, however, did. 
McClellan serves in the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee, which wrapped up a 25-hour session Wednesday by voting to pass Republican-led legislation to cut Medicaid funding by tens of billions and impose “work requirements nationwide for able-bodied adults between the ages of 19 and 65, with several exceptions, including for pregnant people, enrollees with certain disabilities or serious medical conditions, and parents of dependent children,” States Newsroom reported. 
“That is what happened while you were sleeping,” McClellan said Thursday. 
The Medicaid cuts are part of what President Donald Trump has dubbed a “big, beautiful bill,” and it’s likely the Republican-controlled Congress could approve the huge package of measures and send Trump the legislation to sign through their budget reconciliation process. 
States’ allocation of federal funding for Medicaid is determined by a formula called Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP), which remains untouched for now. But some low-income Virginians could contend with the work requirements if the overall package fully passes. 
Virginia resident Aida Pacheco called the proposed work requirements “insulting” earlier this year when describing how her adult daughter had to stop work during aggressive breast cancer treatment, which Medicaid now helps her cover.

She expressed frustration that some opponents of Medicaid have accused beneficiaries of “abusing the system” or being people who “don’t want to work.” 
And while people who utilize Medicaid do work — and often tap into the program should their employer not provide health insurance — Pacheco said people like her daughter would be in health care limbo if Trump’s planned overhaul succeeds.
Henrico County resident Andrew Daughtry, who joined McClellan’s press call Thursday, said he left his job at Dollar General to pursue his dream of working in construction several years ago. Though he was able to earn more money in that field, he no longer had health insurance, so Medicaid allowed him to stay on top of his physical and mental health care in recent years. 
Now temporarily out of work because of an injury on the job, he said he’s sorting through worker’s compensation while he prepares for forthcoming surgeries. Medicaid has helped him manage his appointments.

“I want to tell Congress, ‘please don’t question our work ethic because that is insulting,’” Daughtry said. “I couldn’t get health care through my job but I need Medicaid to pay the thousands of dollars of injuries that have happened on the job.”
 McClellan noted how uninsured people are more likely to avoid regular checkups or treatments for chronic disorders — resulting in emergency room visits when dire situations arise. As emergency rooms are federally-required to treat all patients, this means care for uninsured patients who cannot pay can become a shared financial burden on taxpayers. 
“When you kick people off of their health insurance, that raises the cost for everybody else,” McClellan said. 
While the FMAP hasn’t yet changed, McClellan remains concerned it could. If that happens, state lawmakers will have to determine how to keep the roughly 630,000 Virginians that are eligible under the state’s 2018 expansion covered. 
Trigger language in that law could end the expansion if federal funding is adjusted. Currently, Virginia’s private acute-care hospitals are footing the 10% not covered by federal funding. Some state lawmakers suggested earlier this year that a special session could become possible to sort out if and how the state could take up the rest of the funding mantle. 
Meanwhile, Gov. Glenn Youngkin reserved $900 million of the state’s budget surplus as “cushion” for “short-term disruptions” from steep federal cuts and job layoffs. 
Some Republican members of Virginia’s congressional delegation expressed satisfaction Thursday about being able to advance Trump’s agenda without altering the funding formula for Virginia’s federal Medicaid allocation 
U.S. Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Westmoreland said that he’s “pleased to see Virginia’s vulnerable populations protected in the Medicaid portion of the reconciliation bill and no change to the federal match rate.”

However, an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office shared with States Newsroom shows that the Medicaid changes would cut $625 billion in federal spending over the next decade. About 10.3 million people would lose access to Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with 7.6 million people becoming uninsured during that 10-year budget window.
After fielding constituents’ concerns about the federal cuts for months, Wittman publicly cautioned his colleagues in April, co-signing a letter to Congressional leadership emphasizing protection of “children, seniors, individuals with disabilities, and pregnant women who rely on Medicaid for their health and economic security.”
He added Thursday that trimming or eliminating other aspects of the program will ensure that it is “a sustainable program for years to come.”
U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Salem, however, had sharper words for his Democratic colleagues. 
“Congressional Democrats and progressive prognosticators shouted day and night that the Energy and Commerce Committee couldn’t make budget recommendations without massive, significant cuts to Medicaid,” he said in a statement, in an apparent reference to FMAP’s preservation in the proposed measure “And yet, House Republicans proved them all wrong.” 
No other Republican members of Virginia’s congressional delegation responded to requests for comment by the time of this publication.
Now that the Energy and Commerce committee’s recommendations have advanced, they will be considered next by the Budget Committee. Changes to the reconciliation bill — how Congress is working through the budget right now — will still be possible. Then they will have to be voted on by both the full House of Representatives and U.S. Senate.

Glenn Youngkin signs legislation reforming child welfare laws in Richmond on Thursday as Katie Jones (right), who spent much of her childhood in the foster system, looks on. (Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)Katie Jones was 11 the last time she saw her childhood home, where her father, an alcoholic, stayed between jail stints and her mother struggled with heroin addiction. One day after school, just moments after she had settled in with a bag of chips and her homework, police and social services workers pulled up outside. 
Within minutes, Jones and her five siblings were loaded into vehicles, separated from each other, and plunged into the foster care system — an experience that would shuffle her through five homes, three schools, and years of uncertainty before she aged out at 18, never adopted.
Now 25, Jones stood beside Gov. Glenn Youngkin on Thursday as he signed a slate of new child welfare reforms into law and launched “Safe Kids, Strong Families,” a sweeping initiative to strengthen Virginia’s support for foster youth and help families in crisis stay together.
“The system is broken and it needs to be changed,” Jones told the crowd gathered at the Patrick Henry Building in Richmond’s Capitol Square. “I hope sharing my story today makes a difference.”
As of April 1 2024, there are 5,156 children in foster care in Virginia, with 2,638 (51.16%) children in non-relative foster homes, according to data from the Virginia Department of Social Services. The children range in age from birth to 17 years.
Thursday’s event brought together lawmakers, advocates, caseworkers, and foster families to celebrate progress in Virginia’s child welfare system — and to acknowledge how far it still has to go.
Among the bills Youngkin signed were House Bill 1777 and Senate Bill 1406, bipartisan proposals that guarantee foster youth age 12 and older direct access to the Office of the Children’s Ombudsman. 
The legislation ensures children can file complaints and communicate with the ombudsman without requiring permission from social workers, foster parents, or custodians. It also requires agencies to provide contact information to foster youth, their families and caregivers.
Supporters say the measure will help increase transparency and empower youth to advocate for themselves — something Jones didn’t always feel she could do.
“Children need families. Children need support, and they need love,” Youngkin said. “When we work together in order to address this basic need … then we are all marching together toward a destination that will truly guarantee a great future for the commonwealth of Virginia.”
The governor said his focus on child welfare reform began at the onset of his term with one startling fact: over 100 children in foster care were sleeping in social services offices because there was nowhere else to send them.
“I asked Janet Kelly to take on this most important task of finding a place for these children to call home,” Youngkin said. Kelly, now Virginia’s Secretary of Health and Human Resources, had been serving as a senior advisor at the time. She launched the Safe and Sound Task Force, and within months, the number of children sleeping in government offices dropped dramatically.
“I remember the first time she came into my office and said, ‘Governor, tonight, there are no children sleeping in offices.’ That was a moment,” Youngkin said. “Today, we still have a few. But that is the absolute exception now — not the rule.”
Kelly, speaking from personal experience, called the work “deeply personal.”

“By investing in them, coaching them, believing in them, trusting them, teaching them, loving them, and listening to them, all kids — even and especially kids in foster care — can have the opportunity to turn heartbreak into hope,” she said.
Thirteen years ago, Kelly and her husband took custody of an 18-month-old boy through a kinship placement. “It worked pretty well,” she said, “but we know all too well that the balance of hope and heartbreak never ends when it comes to foster care.”
Another reform that Youngkin signed Thursday, Senate Bill 801, modernizes the Children’s Services Act (CSA), expanding eligibility to children identified as “in need of services.” It also mandates state approval for the tool used to determine eligibility and eliminates outdated references to long-defunct programs and structures.
Youngkin called the bill a turning point. “Kinship care is at the heart of providing a safe place for kids and strong families,” he said. “And the work that was done on a bipartisan basis … changes everything.”
He pointed to recent progress in Virginia’s kinship placement rankings. “We’re watching the numbers move,” he said. “Virginia went from last, and we’re climbing.”
But the governor also issued a challenge.
“Notwithstanding the tremendous progress that we have made, we have huge mountains yet to climb,” Youngkin said. Abuse hotline calls are up 25% since 2020, he noted, and more than 70% of child fatalities tied to abuse or neglect had prior contact with child protective services.
“Forty percent of frontline workers leave their jobs after one year due to trauma and burnout,” he added. “We need to continue to strive to be the very best — not because we want to be ranked, but because we are serving children.”
“Safe Kids, Strong Families” aims to take a system-wide approach to reform, aligning policy, funding, and community efforts around a shared goal — stability, safety, and long-term success for every Virginia child. 
First lady Suzanne Youngkin reminded the audience of the moral and spiritual weight behind the work.
“Every single person in this room — and everyone in the commonwealth of Virginia, in our country, in our world — has an obligation to defend the weak, rescue the poor, keep them from the wicked, and focus on the fatherless and motherless,” she said. “It’s a very intricate web of services, of laws, of God stepping into the gap.”
For Katie Jones, those gaps were often wide and painful.
“The sad truth is most foster kids don’t graduate high school, less than 10% go to college, and even fewer get a degree or certification,” she said. “I was the exception, I got lucky. But to this day, I never got adopted.”

We have the power to make it cheaper and quicker for families to install rooftop solar and home batteries by streamlining local permitting processes.
Unfortunately, permitting wait times and delays for rooftop solar in Colorado are some of the worst in the western United States.
In Arapahoe County, for example, the majority of permits take more than 10 weeks to process. These delays impose significant costs. According to a recent analysis by Brown University, local red tape increases the price of installing a residential solar system by more than $3,200. This price hike puts solar out reach of thousands of Coloradans, particularly low- and middle-income families. As solar professionals in Colorado, we can attest to the detrimental impact of these unnecessary bureaucratic barriers: fewer jobs installing solar and more greenhouse gas emissions.

Wisely, our General Assembly offered legislation this year to tackle this problem. House Bill 25-1096, sponsored by Reps. Lesley Smith and Kyle Brown and Sen. Matt Ball, and championed by Gov. Jared Polis, would have required our cities and counties to implement one of several software platforms that automatically approve most residential solar and home battery permits. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden developed one of these software platforms, SolarAPP+, which is now used in Denver — and in hundreds of other localities around the country. Using a platform such as SolarAPP+ also makes for faster inspections. Automating solar permitting is one of those rare win-wins — saving families and solar installers money and headaches, and saving cities and counties resources and time.
But climate-forward cities and counties, including Boulder and Fort Collins, lined up this legislative session to oppose the legislation and were ultimately responsible for its demise. They argued that automated permitting would prevent them from assessing the historical significance of every home built before 1975 before allowing solar panels on its roof, that certain homes in flood plains should be raised on stilts before they were allowed to install rooftop solar, and that their government IT departments would struggle to implement widely-used free software.
Their opposition is disappointing. Boulder and Fort Collins have set goals to get to 100% renewable energy by 2030 — a stronger target than even the state of Colorado. And yet city officials and local electeds in Boulder and Fort Collins spent valuable time and resources lobbying against a common-sense solution that would make rooftop solar cheaper for Coloradans statewide.
Our local governments should keep two important considerations in mind. First, decarbonization is on the chopping block in Washington, including critical funding for renewable energy projects and facilities in Colorado. Our cities and counties — especially those that claim to be environmental leaders — should do everything in their power to ensure that as subsidies go away we make renewable energy as cheap to buy and as fast to deploy as possible.
Second, we are seeing just how many Americans have lost faith in the simple idea that the government prioritizes our needs over its processes. Across the ideological spectrum, more and more believe that government is standing in the way of building what we need, from critical national infrastructure to a simple home renovation. Cities and counties in Colorado like Boulder and Fort Collins should be at the forefront of creating an efficient government that prioritizes people, rather than hiding behind local exceptionalism to justify burdensome red tape and costly inefficiency.
Colorado is blessed with abundant sunshine, and a commitment to good government. We urge our cities, counties and the legislature to step up and make it easier for Coloradans to install rooftop solar, reduce their utility bills and fight the climate crisis.

(Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)U.S. Rep. Rob Wittman, you wrote an op-ed in the Richmond Times-Dispatch this week pushing back against the madness emanating from Washington regarding budget cuts and federal job layoffs. It was welcome, given the chaos in D.C., but what took you so long?
Are you, a Republican representing Virginia’s 1st Congressional District, really bucking a president from your own party – or is this just PR?
Among your column’s salient points: Washington should spend taxpayer dollars wisely; even then-President Barack Obama said as much in 2010. The national debt has passed $36 trillion. The massive red ink “jeopardizes economic opportunity for future generations.”
Then the key takeaway: “We need to pursue targeted savings – not reckless cuts,” you wrote. “That means using a scalpel, not a sledgehammer, when it comes to rightsizing the federal workforce or realigning federal spending.”
Your overall tack surprised me, since many Republicans in Congress – especially the House – have been scared to confront President Donald Trump and Elon Musk, he of the reckless chainsaw and chief of the dubiously named Department of Government Efficiency. Your colleagues have been much too obsequious, placing their jobs over the welfare of the country. 
What spurred you to speak up now?
“I’ve spoken up from the beginning,” you said Wednesday in emailed responses to that question and others I asked. You provided links to recent news articles, too. Maybe I missed them, but the op-ed was more prominent.
“I called for a compassionate approach to federal workforce reforms, raised concerns after mass layoffs at the Department of Education, and advocated for Virginia’s research institutions to continue receiving federal funding,” you noted.
“I’ve shared personal stories from Virginia’s First District directly with cabinet secretaries and White House officials to ensure the human impact of these policies is fully understood.”
We’ll see whether those discussions have an impact, but it’s good you’re making the arguments.
Virginians are certainly incensed by the upheaval that the White House, the DOGE service (it’s not a real “department”), and feckless Republicans in the U.S. House and Senate majority have caused. They’re all a sop to large corporations and the nation’s wealthiest people. Under the ruse of slashing the debt, administration hacks and lawmakers are endangering the poor, disabled, immigrants and many more Americans.
More than 341,000 federal employees lived in the commonwealth in 2023, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, and many could lose their jobs – even when there’s been no announced criteria for who stays and who goes, or an objective assessment of how essential their duties are.
I’m glad you’re publicly questioning the wisdom of what’s happening in D.C., Rep. Wittman. You’ve been in office since 2007, and won many of your electoral contests comfortably, so you can afford to do so. You could, however, do more.
You voted a few months ago for a budget blueprint in fiscal 2026 that targeted Medicaid, food stamps and other parts of the social safety net. The bill narrowly passed the House, 217-215, on a mainly party-line vote. Part of the goal is to extend the tax cuts passed in 2017 during Trump’s first term that are set to expire this year.
Those cuts worsened the situation. Trump’s first term saw the national debt rise by $7.8 trillion – a staggering amount.  
You said your vote this year was procedural and didn’t enact any cuts: “It simply opened the door for future debate on a broader package …”
A “no” vote, however, would’ve broken with your party, sent a warning shot about the radical nature of this agenda, and forced the Trump-Musk partnership to reassess.
Nearly 2 million Virginians receive Medicaid or FAMIS, the state’s health insurance for children. Efforts to add work requirements for Medicaid, being debated in the U.S. House, would impact whether low-income Virginians still get health care.
When I asked about Medicaid, you replied that after meetings and talks with House leadership, “I am pleased to see Virginia’s vulnerable populations protected in the Medicaid portion of the reconciliation bill. There will be no change to the federal match rate.” You said illegal beneficiaries would be removed from the rolls.
We’ll see if all that happens.
You also skirted a chance to meet with your own constituents in April during a congressional recess, after the chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee advised GOP members not to hold in-person town halls. Many Republican lawmakers followed that gutless advice.
Politicians don’t meet voters when they know their initiatives have incensed the hoi polloi – especially when constituents have no idea why certain jobs and programs are suddenly deemed “extraneous.”
Wittman constituents host town hall in his absence to address immigration, federal funding concerns

The Virginia Mercury reported that 150 people showed up to a town hall in Henrico County last month held in your absence. They criticized overbearing immigration crackdowns and spending cuts. The event was mockingly dubbed “Where’s Wittman?”
Incidentally, your website earlier this week showed you held three town halls last year. You also held a telephone town hall via Facebook in late March, the Mercury reported. One recent town hall, you said, reached over 9,000 constituents – though that’s not the same as facing people in person.
Maybe it’s easier to meet constituents face-to-face when indefensible policies aren’t on the agenda. As I wrote in late March, lawsuits and recalls to work of thousands of employees occurred after some of the initial, poorly planned federal layoffs.
I asked Stephen Farnsworth, a political science professor at the University of Mary Washington, what might explain your willingness to speak out so forcefully now.
As continued cutbacks are materializing, Farnsworth said, “People are getting really worried about how that affects them.” Your op-ed, he added, “speaks to the effectiveness of public opinion in shaping” the policies of lawmakers.
“The reign of Elon Musk has been very bad for the standings of Republicans in public opinion,” the professor said.
 Rep. Wittman, I’m glad you’ve spoken out. Your words seem to confirm your commitment to improving the quality of life of the Virginians you represent.
The proof, though, will be how everyday Americans are affected following these budget negotiations. Many folks not in the top 1% are frightened by the possible outcome.

The governor said it would cost North Carolina $700 million to provide low-income residents with the current level of assistance if the cuts are made.
  Gov. Josh Stein (Photo: Office of the Governor)
SNAP benefits, formerly known as food stamps, help 1.4 million North Carolinians put food on the table, Stein said.
“If Congress goes forward with these plans, our state will be forced into perilous budget decisions – should North Carolinians lose access to food, or should we get rid of other essential services?,” Stein asked. “I urge our members of Congress to reject this budget proposal so that North Carolina families don’t go hungry.”
Currently, the federal government covers 100% of food benefits for SNAP participants. North Carolina footing $700 million in SNAP benefits for the first time would be the equivalent of 8,900 K-12 public school teacher positions, Stein said in the statement.
Stein has sent a letter to Congress laying out the implications for North Carolina if SNAP cuts move forward. Click here to read his letter.
Here’s how Stein said the loss of federal SNAP dollars would impact the state:

Four in five families participating in SNAP in North Carolina have either a child, a senior, or an adult with a disability in the household.
Each dollar used to pay for groceries through SNAP frees up household resources for other essential needs like rent, utilities or child care.
SNAP contributes nearly $2.8 billion to North Carolina’s economy, and has a multiplier effect, with every $1 invested in SNAP benefits generating between $1.50 and $1.80 for local economies.
SNAP cuts would mean people have less to spend at North Carolina’s more than 9,200 SNAP retailers, which would hurt farmers, the larger food distribution pipeline and local economies overall, especially in rural areas and small towns.

Stein said SNAP is playing a vital role in supporting western North Carolinians impacted by Hurricane Helene. He said the state’s 25 western counties most impacted by Helene still have higher enrollment in SNAP in April 2025 than they did in September 2024 before the storm hit.
Immediately after the storm, SNAP received 169,000 applications – the highest number of applications since Hurricane Florence in 2018, he said.
The U.S. House is proposing $300 billion in cuts to SNAP over the next 10 years. The program is one of the nation’s long-standing anti-poverty initiatives,. It helps more than 41 million of the nation’s most vulnerable citizens afford food.
In a message to supporters, the N.C. Budget and Tax Center said the GOP-proposed cuts to SNAP and Medicaid threaten the well-being of thousands of North Carolinians.
“As we consider what this proposal means to our communities and families here in North Carolina, we must be clear with our federal delegation — and particularly [North Carolina] Senators [Thom] Tillis and [Ted] Budd — that the House’s proposed plan to take away health care and food assistance from North Carolinians to fund tax cuts for the richest 1 percent is unacceptable.” the Budget and Tax Center said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Canned-food-provided-at-the-rescue-mission.jpg,,,2025-05-16 05:02:54.695995

Tara Reardon, a Concord Democrat, speaks during a Senate session, Thursday, May 15, 2025. (Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)The New Hampshire Senate advanced two anti-sanctuary city bills to Gov. Kelly Ayotte’s desk Thursday, bringing key Republican efforts closer to completion. 
But in other areas — including other immigration bills — the Republican-led Senate put the brakes on some conservative proposals advanced by the House. 
The chamber killed a bill that would have required all training and testing materials to be produced in English. It held back a bill that would require applicants for driver’s licenses who do not have U.S. citizenship to prove they were certified to drive in their home country.  
And it blocked a number of House bills designed to increase verification measures to vote. 
Here’s a look at where Senate Republicans broke from their House counterparts this week — and where they found agreement.
Anti-sanctuary bills
The House and Senate are aligned on a pair of anti-sanctuary bills. On Thursday, the Senate passed House Bill 511, which would require all municipalities to comply with immigration detainers by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) “if safe to do so.” 
The bill, known as an anti-sanctuary city bill, would also prohibit municipalities from adopting policies to ignore federal directives or not cooperate with federal authorities. 
But it also includes a few exceptions. It does not require local law enforcement to pass along an undocumented person’s information when they have been a “necessary witness or victim” of a serious crime, which would include murder, rape, domestic violence, assault, kidnapping, blackmail, and other offenses.
And it prohibits local law enforcement from investigating the citizenship status of someone in their custody, unless they are investigating whether that person broke New Hampshire law. 
Sen. Regina Birdsell said the bill is about forcing communities to follow federal law. 
“When federal authorities present an immigration detainer, New Hampshire police departments should honor that and not help illegal immigrants evade the law,” she said. “I never thought this would be controversial.” 
But Sen. Tara Reardon, a Concord Democrat, countered that communities might not support ICE detainers and shouldn’t be forced by the Legislature to comply with them. 
“As a state, we should not be asked to take the responsibilities or bear the costs that … lead to such outcomes,” said Reardon. “Communities like ours should not be put in the position of enabling mass deportations or detentions that go against our values and ignore our legal and social systems.” 
HB 511 will go directly to the governor’s desk in the coming weeks. Ayotte has supported it.
On Thursday, the Senate approved House changes to a second anti-sanctuary city bill, Senate Bill 62, which would block state or local governments from prohibiting law enforcement entities from entering into voluntary agreements with ICE. That bill will also head directly to Ayotte’s desk.
Sen. Bill Gannon, a Sandown Republican, noted that he has been pushing for legislation to end sanctuary cities for years, and said with the passage of SB 62, “we’ll finally complete this journey.”
Immigration bills
Yet in some areas of immigration policy, the Senate has pulled back from what the House had pushed for.
House Bill 452 created a number of new hurdles for undocumented people and those without U.S. citizenship to obtain driver’s licenses.
The bill would stop the Division of Motor Vehicles from renewing a driver’s license for anyone who is not a U.S. citizen and “cannot prove that they are a lawful permanent resident of the United States.” Currently, there is no such prohibition.
State statute says the DMV “may” require nonresidents who are living in the state on a temporary basis to provide a certification from the government of their country of origin that indicates they are licensed to drive. HB 452 would change “may” to “shall,” making it a requirement, and would allow the DMV to also accept proof of previous vehicle operation in the person’s foreign country.
But without debate, the Senate re-referred the bill to the Transportation Committee, which means there will be no vote by the full Senate until early 2026.
The Senate also killed House Bill 461, which would require that all driver’s license examinations and related materials be “distributed in the English language only,” with an exception for American Sign Language.
But it passed House Bill 71, which would prohibit public schools from offering their facilities as emergency shelter or housing exclusively to undocumented people, even if ordered to do so by the federal government or the state. The bill would allow schools to be used as shelters in other emergencies for specified disasters — including fires, floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, storms, high water events, tidal waves, earthquakes, or snowstorms — as long as those emergencies do not exceed 72 hours.
Voting bills
The Senate has not given House Republicans everything they have asked with voting legislation, either.
The two chambers are aligned on one particular issue. In March, the Senate passed Senate Bill 213, requiring people seeking to obtain absentee ballots to produce documentary proof of U.S. citizenship through a birth certificate, passport, or other document. The bill would bring the absentee ballot process under the same requirements as the in-person voting requirements. Last year, then-Gov. Chris Sununu signed a law imposing a hard documentary proof of citizenship requirement for new voter registrations in the state. That bill — the furthest-reaching in the country — is currently facing two lawsuits in federal court.
The Senate’s bill mirrors House Bill 217, which passed the House in March, indicating support in both chambers. On Thursday, the Senate killed that bill, arguing it was duplicative.
But the Senate rejected a different bill, House Bill 274. That bill would have required supervisors of the checklists to comb through their municipality’s voter rolls once a year and purge any voter who has not voted within the previous five years. Currently, those reviews are done once every 10 years. 
“The committee believes that requiring a yearly check, when there are already periodic checks in statute, would increase administrative costs and unduly overburden local election officials,” wrote Sen. James Gray in an explanation in the Senate calendar.

(Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)Private equity companies have gobbled up group homes and other services for people with disabilities, attracting the attention of state and federal regulators across the nation and alarming advocates.
People with intellectual or developmental disabilities have suffered abuse, neglect and even death while under the care of private equity-owned providers, according to a recent report from watchdog group Private Equity Stakeholder Project.
“Private equity firms are, more than many other types of investors, laser-focused on maximizing their cash flow, often trying to double or triple their investment over a relatively short period of time, usually just a handful of years,” said Eileen O’Grady, the report’s author. “The way that private equity firms will often do that is to cut costs.”
For companies that provide essential services for people with disabilities, she said, “those cuts can have really harmful impacts on people’s lives.”
In late 2023, Florida moved to revoke the license of NeuroRestorative, one branch of the private equity-owned health services company Sevita, which provides services for people with disabilities. State regulators cited repeat violations by NeuroRestorative and a failure to “protect the rights of its clients to be free from physical abuse.” Ultimately the state opted not to revoke the license and fined the company $13,000 in a settlement.
But in recent years regulators have documented instances of patient harm at Sevita’s affiliates in multiple other states, including Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, Massachusetts and Utah. In 2019, a U.S. Senate committee conducted a probe into the company’s operations in Iowa and Oregon following multiple reports of patient abuse and neglect.
‘Shell game’: When private equity comes to town, hospitals can see cutbacks, closures

“Any entity that receives taxpayer dollars, but especially those charged with caring for our fellow Americans who may have an intellectual disability, ought to be doing everything under the sun to ensure quality care and continually improve,” U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, said in a statement in 2020 following his investigation.
In a statement to Stateline, Sevita did not address the sanctions directly, but avowed its commitment to providing services and supports to give people greater independence, regardless of their intellectual or physical challenges.
“Since 2019, when new ownership acquired the company, there has been significant capital investment to improve and expand our services, enhance facilities, implement robust training and new technologies, and strengthen our workforce — all with the goal of better serving our individuals and communities,” the statement said.
The disability care industry has proven increasingly attractive to private equity.
In recent years, a handful of large private equity-owned companies such as Sevita have snapped up hundreds of smaller providers of disability services — often community nonprofits, mom-and-pop businesses and religious organizations — and rolled them into larger corporations.
From 2013 to 2023, private equity firms acquired more than 1,000 disability and elder care providers, according to the report by the Private Equity Stakeholder Project. That’s likely an undercount because they’re generally not required to disclose acquisitions, the report said.
Cash cow
Private equity firms use pooled investments from pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, endowments and wealthy individuals to buy a controlling stake in a company. They seek to maximize its value — often by cutting costs — and then sell it at a profit.
Most of Sevita’s revenue comes from providing disability services. It operates companies in 40 states under various brands, including Mentor Network, NeuroRestorative and REM.
Sevita is currently owned by private equity firms Centerbridge Partners and Vistria Group, which also own Help at Home, a home health company with more than 200 locations across about a dozen states.
Nearly all of Sevita’s revenue comes from Medicaid, according to a February 2025 report from S&P Global.
Private equity’s growing footprint in home health care draws scrutiny

Through Medicaid and Medicare, the government pays for most services for people with intellectual or developmental disabilities. The two programs cover services such as group homes, adult day programs, in-home care, and physical and occupational therapy.
“Sevita has been owned by private equity firms for over a decade now, and has been under investigation and scrutiny at the federal and state level for basically that entire time,” O’Grady said.
In 2022, Iowa fined a NeuroRestorative group home $10,500 after a resident was left unattended in a liquor store and drank three-quarters of a bottle of vodka. The same year, Massachusetts temporarily removed Sevita’s license to operate group homes after regulators reported inadequate staff training and supervision, and a “myriad of issues that were uncovered onsite,” according to a Massachusetts Department of Developmental Services report.
The federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has fined a NeuroRestorative facility in Utah four times since 2022. A February 2024 inspection report by the agency found the facility “failed to prevent abuse, neglect … and exploitation” of residents.
Last year, Florida fined another Sevita brand, Florida Mentor, for improper use of restraints. More issues have been documented in Sevita-owned locations in Arkansas, California, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, New Hampshire and Nevada.
Meanwhile, Sevita’s owners, Centerbridge and Vistria, have collected nearly half a billion dollars since 2019 by loading Sevita and Help at Home with debt in order to pay dividends to investors, according to Moody’s, a financial services company.
Similar financial maneuvering contributed to the recent collapse of Steward Health Care, a private equity-owned hospital system that once had more than 30 hospitals nationwide. Steward has become a cautionary tale about the harm that profit-driven private equity firms can do to a state’s health system.
“Before Steward Health Care ultimately collapsed, executives spent years hiding their financial information from state regulators, putting patients and our health care system at risk,” Massachusetts Democratic House Speaker Ron Mariano said in a statement earlier this year announcing a new state law that beefs up reporting and financial requirements for private investors.
“That’s why ensuring that our institutions are equipped to monitor the health care landscape, and to guard against trends and transactions that drive up costs without improving patient outcomes, is so important.”
David vs. Goliath
After two residents of a New Jersey group home died from choking on food in 2017, attorney Cory Bernstein became interested in private equity’s involvement in disability services. The residents had been living in homes operated by AdvoServ, a company then owned by the private equity firm Wellspring Capital Management. The state had cited AdvoServ more times than any other operator in New Jersey for abuse, neglect and unsafe conditions.
AdvoServ later ceased operations in 2019 after multiple state agencies, including in New Jersey, Florida and Maryland, launched investigations.











States just don’t really have the resources or tools to do what needs to be done.


– Cory Bernstein, staff attorney at the National Disability Rights Network



But even when state regulators are doing all they can to protect people with disabilities from substandard care, they’re limited in how much they can hold a company accountable, Bernstein told Stateline.
“It’s state-level oversight on a national entity with not much [help] coming from the federal side,” said Bernstein, who is now a staff attorney at the National Disability Rights Network, a membership organization of federally mandated state disability advocacy programs.
“States just don’t really have the resources or tools to do what needs to be done.”
A regulatory agency in Georgia might shut down all the group homes owned by a certain company, for example, but those regulators can’t do anything about the company’s abuses in, say, Montana. With branches in multiple states, a company is better able to withstand sanctions or even a loss of license in one state, he said.
“[States] are not set up to go up against a national operator with billions of dollars in resources in a regulatory or oversight battle,” Bernstein said.
Further complicating things for state regulators and for consumers is that a large services company such as Sevita might operate under multiple brand names, even in one state. It can be hard to parse out who owns a sanctioned business. Multiple brand names can also obscure a company’s monopoly on a particular regional market.
Vets fret as private equity snaps up clinics, pet care companies

When Florida regulators reached a settlement agreement with Sevita’s NeuroRestorative last year, the state dismissed its proposed license revocation. O’Grady believes one reason the state chose to settle is the difficulty of finding alternative facilities to relocate the residents who would have been displaced from the 13 locations the company operated around the state.
“Because of that dearth of alternatives and the impotence of the state to act more fully, this company will continue to be allowed to operate,” she said.
Further complicating oversight: Large companies often operate various services that are overseen by different agencies. Group homes might be regulated under the state’s Medicaid program, while facilities that provide more intensive care might come under federal Medicare oversight.
There could be “two completely different oversight systems for facilities serving the same population in the same state with the same name,” Bernstein said.
State solutions
Some states have moved to address problems with private equity involvement in health care by passing tighter restrictions on mergers and acquisitions of health care companies.
In Rhode Island, where private equity companies’ mismanagement of health care providers threatened the future of local hospitals, a robust oversight law allowed the state attorney general to impose conditions to protect the hospitals’ finances.
More states are following suit. In 2023 alone, 24 states enacted laws related to health system consolidation and competition, while this year at least half a dozen have considered legislation to check private equity-fueled health care mergers.

This week, current and past staff of libraries across the state laid out for lawmakers the different ways in which the libraries have played a role in their lives and the lives of their community.
Constance Evans taught high school for 25 years, using libraries in the several counties in which she taught to supplement her English lessons and other topics.
After more than two decades, she went back to school to get a degree in Library Science.
“More than anything, that year taught me how libraries had morphed into an eclectic mix of technology, print, and online materials, and valuable partnerships connected to every facet of our Ohio communities,” Evans told the Ohio Senate Education Committee.
One thing most library representatives who spoke brought up as an important – and popular – part of their role in the community was the age-old early literacy program called storytime.
“Our storytimes are so popular that it’s not uncommon that our parking lot is full and people have to park elsewhere in the city to get to our library,” said Chauncey Montgomery, director of the Community Library in Sunbury.
For the Columbus Metropolitan Library, storytime is a stealthy way to slide learning in alongside entertainment and engagement.
“What seems like a fun-filled 30-minute reading, singing and dancing session to the untrained eye is a well-planned kindergarten readiness program designed around the four cornerstones of reading — letter recognition, beginning letter sounds, rhymes and vocabulary,” said Lauren Hagan, CEO of the Columbus library system.
Storytimes are fairly universal among libraries in the state, but there are other programs that are more tailored to the particular area of the state the library calls home.
New Carlisle is an area with a poverty rate of 20.5%, compared to the 13.3% that stands as the state average. Food insecurity is a significant issue for families who come to the New Carlisle Public Library, according to director Beth Freeman.
“We have begun offering a dinner storytime, where all family members are able to have a good meal provided by a local restaurant and hear an entertaining story one evening a month,” Freeman told the committee.
Programs of all kinds could be on the chopping block if funding changes are implemented, in a day and age when libraries have already had to be creative with existing funds as library demand and demand for more modern resources goes up. The Public Library Fund, which is currently a percentage of the state’s General Revenue Fund, saw a $27 million loss last year.
“Public funds have given our library the ability to be innovative, creative and enduring,” said Aimee Fifarek, director and CEO of the Public Library of Youngstown and Mahoning County. “All these services and programs were all made possible because our elected leaders invested in our community.”

The House’s version of the budget would eliminate the 1.7% the Public Library Fund gets from the General Revenue Fund, and create a line-item appropriation. Legislators argued that would be a better deal for libraries, because they would avoid the fluctuations of state tax revenue from year to year.
“I’m not wanting to cut funding for libraries,” said state Sen. Kyle Koehler, R-Springfield, a member of the Senate Education Committee. “But we have a hard time understanding how a percentage of a fluctuating GRF somehow makes it easier for you.”
Advocates fear going to a line-item appropriation rather than a percentage of state tax revenue could put them at risk for “across the board cuts” if the state needed to tighten its belt, as it did during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Michelle Francis, head of the Ohio Library Council.
“We’ve seen lots of programs that are line-items get eliminated, and so I will tell you that that is a strong concern going forward,” Francis said.
The budget approved by the House also rejected a proposal from the governor’s executive budget that would have raised the PLF distribution to 1.75%. An increase of that size would amount to another $15 million each year for public library coffers, according to Jay Smith, director of government and legal services for the Ohio Library Council.
With the rise in visits to libraries, up 3.4 million to 48 million visits statewide in 2024, according to the council, advocates have taken to comparing the crowds who visit their facilities to audiences at football games. Francis has frequently used Ohio Stadium as a model, saying the statewide number of visits to libraries could fill the Shoe more than 400 times.
“I haven’t compared that (2024 increase) to the Browns stadium, but that’s our next goal,” she told the committee.
Fifarek said 2024 numbers for Youngstown/Mahoning County libraries showed a population that would fill Youngstown State University’s Stambaugh Stadium more than 30 times.
Despite the consistent crowds, libraries only see funding through the Public Library Fund and local levies, with the exception of 48 library systems who don’t have levies on the books.
“We are responsible for our own buildings, but yet we do not receive money in the capital bill,” Francis said, referring to the state’s separate spending bill for infrastructure and other projects. “We also don’t get county sales tax, city income tax, no casino revenue, we didn’t get any direct (American Rescue Plan Act) funds, and we don’t have inside millage. So, that state funding is incredibly critical, and we rely on it more and even greater than our partners do the (local government fund).”
The Senate is currently working on its draft of the budget, which could contain changes to the House’s version. The two chambers will come together after the Senate approves a draft to bring forth a final draft for the governor’s signature before July 1.

Chris Stewart, R-Putnam, hasn't voted in the House since April 9. A staffing shortage at his job is the cause, a party leader said.","On April 9 at 3:59 p.m., Rep. Chris Stewart, R-Putnam, cast the last of the day’s four floor votes and left his desk in the second row of the House of Representatives for the hour-long trip home to Connecticut’s Quiet Corner.
It appears he never came back. There is no record of Stewart casting another House vote.
“Unforeseen professional obligations have temporarily limited my ability to fully engage in legislative duties and have also impacted time with my family,” Stewart said in a statement responding to an inquiry from The Connecticut Mirror.
He did not respond to texts or phone calls seeking more information about his job, its conflict with House sessions, and his expectations when he ran in November to succeed his father-in-law, Ricky Hayes, representing the 51st House District.
The General Assembly is a part-time institution, and the majority of lawmakers have outside jobs. Balancing the roles is often challenging, especially in the final weeks of every annual session.
House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, had few additional details behind Stewart’s long string of missed votes, other than saying the cause was a staffing shortage at his job and not illness.
“Chris has been met with a sudden crisis at work where he has to fill in,” Candelora said. “His employer knew about the commitment he had up here. Everybody was on board. And then they had a personnel situation that he is trying to fix so that he could return up here to vote.”
Stewart did not disclose the nature of his job. His statement of financial interest, a disclosure of outside income lawmakers file every April, listed his employer as Eliot Community Health Services Inc. of Massachusetts.
It was unclear when Stewart’s job situation changed. A spot check of meetings of the Education Committee, one of his legislative assignments, found uneven attendance throughout March. He didn’t vote on 26 of the 45 bills reported out of committee.

The legislature meets for three months in even-numbered years and five months in odd ones. This year, the session opened on Jan. 8 and will adjourn on June 4. Committee work, drafting and assessing bills, dominates the first months.
Once committee deadlines pass in late April, the focus turns to floor votes in the House and Senate. Stewart missed House sessions on eight days from April 28 through Thursday, including three days this week.
The House is expected to hold floor votes on four days next week. Stewart has indicated hopes of being there, a GOP staff member said.
In his statement, Stewart said he intends to remain a member of the legislature in the seat he won with 54% of the vote in November.
“Despite these challenges, my commitment to serving our district remains unwavering,” Stewart said. “I continue to stay informed on daily proceedings of the legislature and am working toward a full return as soon as possible.”
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said both parties have had challenges with attendance at times.
“I have, certainly, especially post-COVID, when it was a little more difficult to get people back after getting more used to remote [work,]” Ritter said.
Legislators can participate and vote during committee members via video conferencing. A lawmaker can cast a House or Senate floor vote remotely, but only if they are in the Capitol or Legislative Office Building.
Minimum annual compensation for a House member is $48,100, which includes a salary of $43,600 and unvouchered expenses of $4,500.
Like every member of the General Assembly, Stewart essentially is an independent contractor answerable to the voters, not an employee who can be fired or have their pay docked by the House leadership.
“They are elected, duly elected, and they have to persuade people to vote for them,” Ritter said.
Candelora said Stewart’s situation is a complication of “a citizen-legislature that’s part time.”
“I still think that we are better off for it, because it brings different perspectives to the building that you wouldn’t otherwise have with a full-time legislature,” Candelora said. “But it does bring these kind of challenges.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/STEWART-DESK-051425-SR-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-16 05:02:54.695995

Among the most worrisome bills under consideration in Raleigh this year is a Senate proposal that would weaken the state’s commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. By removing a 2030 target for a 70 percent reduction in carbon emissions, the bill takes another big step backward in confronting the global climate crisis.
But as Tom Ervin, a former judge and South Carolina Public Service Commission member noted in a recent op-ed for NC Newsline, there’s another reason for concern: the legislation’s likely impact on ratepayer electric bills.
As Ervin explained, under the proposal, utility giants Duke and Dominion would be allowed to charge their electric customers upfront for the costs of building new plants.
And when this happened in his state, consumers were left stuck with billions of dollars in sunk expenses to cover when a planned power plant went belly up.
The bottom line: According to our neighbor, big and expensive trouble is on the way for North Carolina unless lawmakers reject the utility industry gift. Let’s hope they’re listening.

This legislative session has raised some concerns that not enough people understand that the best way to save money is to prevent the problem from ever even happening. We must emphasize this important life lesson to save existing prevention efforts and continue supporting our youth.
We have all heard about the budget cuts that have been suggested to save money but we must ask: At what cost? Primary health prevention shows, on the very low end, that every dollar invested in prevention saves on average $6 in health care costs. When we expand that to substance misuse prevention efforts the estimated cost savings climbs to as high as $12 to $18 for every dollar spent on providing information and awareness on the dangers of drugs and alcohol to children and teens.
New Hampshire prevention community coalitions and public health networks have been strategically working to lower the rates of substance misuse among our youth. It has taken time to build a strong network with qualified individuals who understand the process and how to effectively make change. The very foundation of this work and the infrastructure that helps keep it moving forward is in danger in many ways in our state at the moment.
First, let’s talk about House Bill 446, to make the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) that is administered to youth every two years and collects vitality important information, an opt-in survey. This means parents or guardians would have to sign a permission form for their child to participate in this survey. Currently there is a 10 day period prior to the survey that adults are made aware of the survey so they can review it and choose to opt their child out if they are uncomfortable with it. To be clear, the information collected in the survey is completely anonymous and on topics our youth are well versed in, curious about, and talking about, but are subjects their adults might find uncomfortable to talk about, like drug use, mental health, and sex.
The data collected in these surveys allows community coalitions who come together to support the youth growing up in their towns and cities to design messaging and programming to help support our youth making healthy choices and provide them with knowledge of where to go for help and support.
The needs identified also allow us to reach out to our partners across the state and share information and resources on how to best address these needs. This leads us to our next concern: the budget.
The New Hampshire Liquor Commission-Division of Enforcement (NHLE) is on the list of cuts in the current proposed budget. NHLE does so much behind the scene work to help with prevention but on a community-facing level they are the people we can call if we have a report of an establishment selling alcohol or tobacco to an underage buyer. They help us raise awareness that the legal age to purchase alcohol and tobacco is 21, and they are the ones who enforce these laws if they are broken.
The Tobacco Prevention and Cessation Program is also on the line to be cut. This department provides updated information and awareness resources for local community youth groups, schools, and organizations to share and raise awareness about the current threats around nicotine products, and their harmful effects on teens and adults alike. They also provide access to ways to quit for those who may be ready to take that next step toward a healthier lifestyle, such as 1-800-quit-now and My Life My Quit for teens.
The loss of even one of these tools (the YRBS, NHLE, or Tobacco Control) could drastically change the landscape of prevention work in New Hampshire. All three are vital tools in our New Hampshire prevention tool box to help keep our kids and communities safe from the unknown harms that can come with exploring substance misuse at a young age.
If you care about our young people, or you care about a budget that invests it money wisely to make a difference and save you money in the future, please speak up so the people who are invested in keeping kids, communities, and roads safe in New Hampshire can continue to do the great work they do — saving lives and limiting lifelong addiction.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/teenboy-1024x682.jpeg,,,2025-05-16 05:02:54.695995

That includes 68% of his fellow Republicans and 56% of Democrats, according to the Gongwer-Werth Legislative Poll released Thursday.
It was conducted on Tuesday and Wednesday, and 44 of the state’s 132 lawmakers responded.
In a related question, 35% said Lt. Gov. Jim Tressel would seek the 2026 Republican nomination to be governor, 47% said he wouldn’t, and 19% were undecided.
On the Democratic side, 33% of respondents said former U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown would run for that body again next year. Twenty-six percent said he’d run for governor, and 42% were either undecided or said he’d run for neither seat.
A majority, 51%, said former U.S. Rep. and U.S. Senate candidate Tim Ryan would seek the Democratic gubernatorial nomination. Just 12% said he’d run for Senate again, and the rest were undecided or said he’d run for neither.
Former Ohio Department of Health director Dr. Amy Acton is currently the only Democratic primary candidate in the race.
At this point, the Republican race to succeed Gov. Mike DeWine is the topic of the most fervent speculation among the races surveyed. The Gongwer-Werth poll gives a peek at what’s being said among lawmakers.
Yost had been vying with former Lt. Gov. Jon Husted for the GOP nomination.

But businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, who is close to President Donald Trump, expressed an interest. Then Gov. Mike DeWine appointed Husted to the U.S. Senate seat vacated by J.D. Vance when he was elevated to the vice presidency. 
Trump endorsed Ramaswamy shortly after his inauguration, and then the Ohio Republican Party followed suit last Friday.
Ohio GOP endorses Vivek Ramaswamy for governor

While speculation rages about the future of the Yost campaign, Tressel remains a wild card. DeWine appointed him lieutenant governor after elevating Husted, and it was seen by some as a shrewd maneuver against a MAGA wing of the party with which DeWine has at times been at odds.
In early 2021, at the height of the coronavirus pandemic, the Republican-dominated General Assembly passed a bill that would weaken the governor’s ability to issue health orders. DeWine vetoed it and the legislature overrode his veto — even though he was at least nominally the head of the party in Ohio.
In 2023, Trump accused DeWine of having “fallen to the Radical Left” over his veto of a law that would ban gender-affirming care to minors. And DeWine last year published an op-ed in the New York Times criticizing Trump and Vance for promoting racist lies about Haitian immigrants in Springfield.
Last week, Tressel confirmed that he was considering a run for governor.
As head coach of a national-championship-winning Ohio State football team, Tressel has high name recognition. And his mild demeanor might generate some crossover appeal.
Also, up to Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration, Ramaswamy helped Elon Musk set up the so-called Department of Government Efficiency. As it tries to slash funding and personnel for veterans benefits, Social Security, national parks, and public health, the unofficial agency might not be popular by the time voters start tuning into the governor’s race next year.
For his part, the Democrat Brown had held statewide office and was in the U.S. Congress when he ousted DeWine from his U.S. Senate seat in 2006. Brown held it until November, when he lost to Cleveland car dealer Bernie Moreno in one of the most expensive races in history.
Brown hasn’t ruled out running again for Senate — where he would face Husted next year — or for governor.
Ryan, who lost to Vance in 2022 by a six-point margin, said he’d make a decision this summer about again running for statewide office.

Photo by WEWS.In a short meeting, the Ohio Ballot Board signed off on a proposed constitutional amendment abolishing property taxes in the state. The only question before the board was whether the proposal contains one or multiple amendments.
Supporters contend lawmakers have been unwilling or unable to make significant enough changes as property taxes climb. But critics warn eliminating that revenue stream could cripple important services like schools and first responders.

The day after the ballot board meeting, Beth Blackmarr described her mood as ‘busy.’
“Busy, busy, busy,” she said, “I mean, here we go — we’ve got to hit the ground running.”
Blackmarr is part of the organization Citizens for Property Tax Reform which is leading the repeal campaign. With the ballot board’s decision, the group is now able to start gathering signatures to appear on the ballot.
To go before voters, they’ll need 10% of the electoral turnout from the last governor’s race (just shy of 415,000). Additionally, in 44 of Ohio’s counties, they’ll need signatures from at least 5% of the governor’s race turnout. In practice, campaigns turn in hundreds of thousands more signatures than necessary to make up for any rejections.
Blackmarr said they want to start collecting “as soon as humanly possible,” and work could begin as early as next week. Asked whether they’d work with paid circulators, she just laughed.
“Many of us are youthful at heart, but senior citizens that are just really working out of our pockets,” she said. “There’s no big money backing this at all. It’s all volunteer.”
What would happen if Ohio abolished property taxes?

The merits
Blackmarr argued Ohio’s current property tax system is broken. She points to other states like New Jersey and Texas that have far more generous initiatives to keep seniors, vets and the disabled in their homes.
“You can’t have senior citizens who have paid for their homes — fully paid for — having to move out because they can’t afford property tax,” she insisted.
Blackmarr contends those kinds of protections are low-hanging fruit. Lawmakers have had continual warnings and “ample opportunity” to act. Instead, she argued, they’ve dithered with changes at the margins.
“I suspect it’s because they built a wobbly tower of property tax law over these decades,” she said, “and they’re afraid to pull one of the blocks out, because they’re afraid the whole thing’s gonna come tumbling down.”
That ‘tumbling down’ is exactly the concern many critics voice about the plan. The most recent annual report from the Ohio Department of Taxation puts 2023 property tax collections at about $18.5 billion. That’s an enormous amount of funding to just disappear. It’s roughly double the amount reported for state income taxes, and a billion more than Ohio’s sales and use tax.
Spread evenly, it would cost every single Ohioan more than $1,500 to make up that gap in funding.
Blackmarr argued repeal will just force lawmakers “to come up with an alternative.” But that’s a big ask — particularly for Republicans allergic to tax increases.
Still she’s right about dramatic increases in property taxes. The same Department of Taxation report shows assessed values climbing almost 40% in five years while tax collections have risen more than 21%.
Legislature’s role
In a statement following the ballot board decision, House minority leader Allison Russo said the proposal “clearly demonstrates frustration by Ohioans on this issue” and blamed lawmakers for failing to act.
“However, this particular initiative concerns me because while it eliminates the property tax, it doesn’t explain how we’ll replace the funds that support police, fire departments, public education, and other critical services,” she said.
Russo argued Democrats have signed on to bipartisan legislation providing direct relief but Republican leaders haven’t prioritized those bills.
Blackmarr acknowledged that as their campaign gains steam, pressure will grow on lawmakers to pass legislation or propose their own ballot measure to undercut their efforts.
“At the end of the day it goes to the voters,” she said.  “They have to make the decision for themselves.”
And if lawmakers’ intervention means voters have to choose between competing visions, that’s just fine with Blackmarr.
“Wouldn’t that be nice, you know?” she said.

All five independent academic centers have named their executive directors and the University of Toledo Institute of American Constitutional Thought and Leadership started classes this past school year.

Ohio’s 2023 two-year state budget allocated $24 million for the centers — $5 million each fiscal year to Ohio State University, $1 million each fiscal year to the University of Toledo and $2 million each fiscal year for each center at Miami University, Cleveland State University and Wright State University. 
The centers at Ohio State, Miami, Cleveland State and Wright State “shall conduct teaching and research in the historical ideas, traditions, and texts that have shaped the American constitutional order and society,” according to the law.
The University of Toledo’s institute is “established for the purpose of creating and disseminating knowledge about American constitutional thought and to form future leaders of the legal profession through research, scholarship, teaching, collaboration, and mentorship,” according to the law.  
Ohio State University 
The Salmon P. Chase Center for Civics, Culture, and Society will start offering classes in the fall semester including three versions of an American Civic Tradition Class, said university spokesperson Chris Booker. The Chase Center is housed in the John Glenn College of Public Affairs.
Lee Strang was named the executive director of the Chase Center last summer. He previously was the director at the University of Toledo Institute of American Constitutional Thought and Leadership. 
The Chase Center — which will have at least 15 tenure-track faculty members — is in the process of hiring faculty, Booker said. 
The center has already hosted several events, including a conversation with Ohio State President Ted Carter.
Ohio State’s University Senate voted against a proposal to formally establish the Chase Center back in January, according to The Columbus Dispatch. 
“While we respect the voice of the senate, we were disappointed in the vote,” Booker said in an email. “The Chase Center was established in 2023 by the state of Ohio via statute, and Ohio State must develop and operate the center in line with those legal requirements.”
University of Toledo 
Nine courses have been offered through Toledo’s institute since the 2024 summer semester including the art of statesmanship, the art of rhetoric, civic discourse, competing theories of justice, and model U.S. Senate, said university spokesperson Nicki Gorny. 
The institute plans on adding a couple American civics courses this upcoming school year and has hosted more than a dozen public lectures and debates since January 2024, Gorny said. 
Jonathan Culp from the University of Dallas will become the institute’s new director in July. Michael Gonzalez is currently the institute’s interim director. 
Miami University 
Flagg Taylor was recently named the executive director of Miami’s Center for Civics, Culture, and Society. He was approved as the director in April and he previously was a political science professor at Skidmore University in New York. 
Miami’s center will be in the College of Arts and Science and will operate alongside the university’s Menard Family Center for Democracy. 
The university is planning to offer classes through the center this fall, university spokesperson Seth Bauguess said. 
Wright State University 
Wright State hopes to start offering classes through the university’s Center for Civics, Culture and Workforce Development in fall 2026, said university spokesperson Bob Mihalek. Proposed courses could include American civic literacy, from idea to law: an experiential journey through the legislative process and upholding the constitution: exploring your oath, Mihalek said.
Jason Anderson was chosen as the center’s executive director. He is a retired Air Force veteran and a former faculty member with the Air Force Institute of Technology at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.  
Cleveland State University 
Peter Koritansky was picked to be the director of the university’s Center for Civics, Culture and Society and his first day will be June 1, said university spokesperson Kristin Broka. He is currently a professor at the University of Prince Edward Island in Canada. 
The center will be housed in the Levin College of Public Affairs and Education.

(Eric Thomas/Kansas Reflector)Five years ago today, University of Kansas senior Caroline McCray woke up and connected through the internet to a remote yoga class. She practiced the poses in her mom’s kitchen, family dogs at her feet. 
For McCray, May 16, 2020, was a typical Saturday in Fairway during the COVID-19 lockdown.
She finished her yoga class and saw something unusual out the front window of her home. Foot-high letters in the front yard read “YAY LELA!” along with stars and a smiley face wearing a graduation cap. A celebration coordinated by her mom also featured McCray’s sister and boyfriend, plus mimosas during an outdoor brunch that morning. 
McCray posted photos from the day on Instagram. The caption: “this year’s graduation ceremony consists of yoga clothes and dogs.”
“I think as a 21-year-old college student at the time, I was still kind of sad not to be with my friends,” McCray said this week. “But I only have good memories from the morning, and looking back on it now, those are still the three most important people to me.” 
If the pandemic had not forced the closure of campuses at KU and hundreds of other universities, the weekend of May 16, 2020 would have been a raucous and jam-packed graduation weekend. Instead, the class of 2020 — from kindergarten to PhD graduates — celebrated remotely and modestly. 
If not for the pandemic, McCray and thousands of fellow KU students would have descended the “Hill” on the Lawrence campus from the Memorial Campanile to the football stadium. Prospective Jayhawks often hear about the campanile tradition during campus tours, before they even apply to KU. 
“If you walk under the bell tower,” they are told about the superstition, “you won’t graduate on time. Or maybe never graduate.”
As a KU instructor, I have been thinking about the class of 2020 this week on the five-year anniversary of their not-so-graduation ceremony. In many ways, this weekend’s graduates, the class of 2025, will have the commencement that the class of 2020 envisioned. 
Putting on make-up and fine tuning your hair with your roommates. Gathering on Jayhawk Boulevard and running into four years’ worth of friends. Snapping pictures by (or in) the Chi Omega fountain. Popping open champagne with whoops and cheers. Spending one last night at your favorite Mass Street bar.  
Curious about how the canceled in-person graduation looked to the Class of 2020 with the distance of five years, I interviewed students from my documentary class held that 2020 spring semester. 
The class, like graduation itself, ended with a thud. We had arranged to tag along with Kansas City mayor Quinton Lucas as he managed the city and taught at the KU Law School. The pandemic mangled our plans for that documentary project. The mayor’s office couldn’t invite a student-journalist film crew to tag along as the city hunkered down.
Students in the class pivoted to creating podcasts about fellow students, asking them about their pandemic realities. Emily Beckman, who earned bachelor’s degrees in journalism and women, gender and sexuality, said this week that those interviews stuck with her. 
“I would check in with four students regularly to hear how they were navigating lockdown,” Beckman said. “There was something so human about knowing we were all moving through a time of major uncertainty and isolation together.”

Riley Wilson, who came to KU after graduating from Wamego High School and is now a lawyer in Texas, remembers returning to campus in June, a month after graduation because there was no in-person option. 
“We went to campus later with just me and my family,” Wilson said. “I had my graduation stuff on, and my mom took pictures of me, and I did get one in the bell tower. I got to walk through the bell tower, but instead of it being with all my friends, it was with my family. So it was just a very different experience.”
Five years later, she had forgotten about the bell tower tradition until it came up in our interview.
“Had graduation happened the way I thought it was going to, (the bell tower) would have been one of the first things that I would talk about with anyone,” Wilson said, “You finally get to walk through the bell tower and signify that you’re graduated.”
In April 2020, the news that in-person graduation was canceled wasn’t a surprise to Wilson and McCray. Both agree that it was the safest choice, especially because traveling and flying was seen as particularly risky. 
“Once other schools started canceling, I had the feeling that it was going to happen and definitely was bummed,” McCray said. “I think at that point, I knew that my family wasn’t going to be in town anyways. So I guess I wasn’t super shocked at that point, just because I saw it coming.”
Five years later, she describes the canceled graduation as feeling like “loose ends.”
Graduation “was supposed to be like our last celebration of college,” McCray said. “No one was mad or upset about having some classes online. But (graduation) was definitely more of a celebration that we didn’t get to have.”
Wilson’s brother was graduating high school the same weekend, and she remembers her family bracing for the possibility of a hectic weekend. 
“I remember thinking that that was going to be really exciting and fun too, because we could do that together and have everybody there that we wanted to be surrounded by, all in one place for a weekend full of celebration and fun things,” Wilson said.
On commencement weekend 2020, the university offered a video that graduates could stream online in place of the in-person ceremony. The 35-minute video presented congratulations from men’s basketball coach Bill Self, actor Rob Riggle and assorted university faculty. It also provided a performance of the alma mater, “Crimson and the Blue,” lyrics laid over campus scenery. 
“I remember being bummed that it was on YouTube,” Wilson said. “I mean, I knew that there was nothing else that the university could do. They were doing the best that they could, given the fact that we can’t gather together.”
Watching the commencement video today, it’s perhaps more emotional than in 2020. The chorus of the “Rock Chalk,” chanted by a Brady-Bunch screen-collage of students, nearly brought me to tears while rewatching it this week. Plus, the script addresses the sadness of an empty campus in an honest way. 
“For so many of us, the distance on our minds was not the one that we kept from each other, but the one from a campanile to a stadium full of friends and family,” the video narrates over footage of student life. “It can be easy to dwell on the steps that you won’t take, but pause now to think of the strides you’ve made.”
The video may work better as an emotional time capsule today than it did in 2020 as a huzzah for new graduates. 
Beckman watched that video on commencement day and also attended the in-person graduation the next year, because KU allowed 2020 graduates to attend in May 2021. 
“It felt so special to walk down the hill and celebrate my time at KU in a meaningful way, with family in attendance,” Beckman said. 
As Wilson and McCray see it now, other ripple effects from the pandemic were far more disruptive and consequential than the graduation decision. 
As a new graduate, McCray hoped to find a job with a professional sports team in the summer of 2020. She was on the right trajectory after working for Sporting Kansas City and a Kansas City radio station. The pandemic scrambled that. 
Because sports teams couldn’t sell tickets to in-person events, they laid off employees rather than hiring new ones like McCray. 
“After a year, I said, ‘Okay, you know, maybe this isn’t happening,’” McCray said. “COVID in general at the time did make a very, very significant impact on my career. I didn’t end up doing what I always thought I was going to do because of it.”
McCray now works from Denver in the travel industry, a job that she loves for its flexibility. Just a few days ago, she married that boyfriend from her senior year — the one who made the road trip to share brunch with her. 
Wilson remembers how difficult the pandemic was on college friendships, like the one she had with her senior year roommate. One day you were living together. The next day you didn’t see one another at all. 
“Someone who I had lived with for four years was now like … I didn’t live with her anymore, and all our stuff was still at our town home,” Wilson said, remembering of her trip back to campus to move out. “We were just overnight separated. She had to go back to St. Louis, and I had to go back to Wamego. Someone who I had lived my life with for the past four years — we were just separated.”
Three years after moving out of that town home, Wilson graduated from law school. That ceremony showed her what she had missed in 2020. 
“Being able to be there with your classmates, all in the same place, and just really excited and nervous all together,” Wilson recalls. “And then you get to walk out into the auditorium and you see the thousands of people around you there to support everyone. I think that is what makes it so special.”
Wilson is reciting a sacred graduation recipe: a campus you cherish, the people you love and a coveted diploma. Graduations make memories.

Look closely at your mobile phone or tablet. Touch-screen technology, speech recognition, digital sound recording and the internet were all developed using funding from the U.S. National Science Foundation.
No matter where you live, NSF-supported research has also made your life safer. Engineering studies have reduced earthquake damage and fatalities through better building design. Improved hurricane and tornado forecasts reflect NSF investment in environmental monitoring and computer modeling of weather. NSF-supported resilience studies reduce risks and losses from wildfires.
Using NSF funding, scientists have done research that amazes, entertains and enthralls. They have drilled through mile-thick ice sheets to understand the past, visited the wreck of the Titanic and captured images of deep space.
NSF investments have made America and American science great. At least 268 Nobel laureates received NSF grants during their careers. The foundation has partnered with agencies across the government since it was created, including those dealing with national security and space exploration. The Federal Reserve estimates that government-supported research from the NSF and other agencies has had a return on investment of 150% to 300% since 1950, meaning for every dollar U.S. taxpayers invested, they got back between $1.50 and $3.
However, that funding is now at risk.
Since January, layoffs, leadership resignations and a massive proposed reorganization have threatened the integrity and mission of the National Science Foundation. Hundreds of research grants have been terminated. The administration’s proposed federal budget for fiscal year 2026 would cut NSF’s funding by 55%, an unprecedented reduction that would end federal support for science research across a wide range of discipines.
At my own geology lab, I have seen NSF grants catalyze research and the work of dozens of students who have collected data that’s now used to reduce risks from earthquakes, floods, landslides, erosion, sea-level rise and melting glaciers.
I have also served on advisory committees and review panels for the NSF over the past 30 years and have seen the value the foundation produces for the American people.
 American science’s greatness stemmed from war

In the 1940s, with the advent of nuclear weapons, the space race and the intensification of the Cold War, American science and engineering expertise became increasingly critical for national defense. At the time, most basic and applied research was done by the military.
Vannevar Bush, an electrical engineer who oversaw military research efforts during World War II, including development of the atomic bomb, had a different idea.
He articulated an expansive scientific vision for the United States in Science: The Endless Frontier. The report was a blueprint for an American research juggernaut grounded in the expertise of university faculty, staff and graduate students.
On May 10, 1950, after five years of debate and compromise, President Harry Truman signed legislation creating the National Science Foundation and putting Bush’s vision to work. Since then, the foundation has become the leading funder of basic research in the United States.
NSF’s mandate, then as now, was to support basic research and spread funding for science across all 50 states. Expanding America’s scientific workforce was and remains integral to American prosperity. By 1952, the foundation was awarding merit fellowships to graduate and postdoctoral scientists from every state.
There were compromises. Control of NSF rested with presidential appointees, disappointing Bush. He wanted scientists in charge to avoid political interference with the foundation’s research agenda.
 NSF funding matters to everyone, everywhere

Today, American tax dollars supporting science go to every state in the union.
The states with the most NSF grants awarded between 2011 and 2024 include several that voted Republican in the 2024 election – Texas, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina and Pennsylvania – and several that voted Democratic, including Massachusetts, New York, Virginia and Colorado.
More than 1,800 public and private institutions, scattered across all 50 states, receive NSF funding. The grants pay the salaries of staff, faculty and students, boosting local employment and supporting college towns and cities. For states with major research universities, those grants add up to hundreds of millions of dollars each year. Even states with few universities each see tens of millions of dollars for research.
As NSF grant recipients purchase lab supplies and services, those dollars support regional and national economies.
When NSF budgets are cut and grants are terminated or never awarded, the harm trickles down and communities suffer. Initial NSF funding cuts are already rippling across the country, affecting both national and local economies in red, blue and purple states alike.
An analysis of a February 2025 proposal that would cut about US$5.5 billion from National Institutes of Health grants estimated the ripple effect through college towns and supply chains would cost $6.1 billion in GDP, or total national productivity, and over 46,000 jobs.
 An uncertain future for American science

America’s scientific research and training enterprise has enjoyed bipartisan support for decades. Yet, as NSF celebrates its 75th birthday, the future of American science is in doubt. Funding is increasingly uncertain, and politics is driving decisions, as Bush feared 80 years ago.
A list of grants terminated by the Trump administration, collected both from government websites and scientists themselves, shows that by early May 2025, NSF had stopped funding more than 1,400 existing grants, totaling over a billion dollars of support for research, research training and education.
Most terminated grants focused on education – the core of science, technology and engineering workforce development critical for supplying highly skilled workers to American companies. For example, NSF provided 1,000 fewer graduate student fellowships in 2025 than in the decade before − a 50% drop in support for America’s best science students.
American scientists are responding to NSF’s downsizing in diverse ways. Some are pushing back by challenging grant terminations. Others are preparing to leave science or academia. Some are likely to move abroad, taking offers from other nations to recruit American experts. Science organizations and six prior heads of the NSF are calling on Congress to step up and maintain funding for science research and workforce development.
If these losses continue, the next generation of American scientists will be fewer in number and less well prepared to address the needs of a population facing the threat of more extreme weather, future pandemics and the limits to growth imposed by finite natural resources and other planetary limits.
Investing in science and engineering is an investment in America. Diminishing NSF and the science it supports will hurt the American economy and the lives of all Americans.

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)In the wake of President Donald Trump’s executive order aiming to reinstate “common sense” school discipline, more states may follow and expand the authority of teachers and school officials to deal with disruptive students.
The order, signed in April, repeals prior federal guidance that encouraged schools to address racial disparities in discipline, arguing that such policies promoted “discriminatory equity ideology” and compromised school safety by pressuring administrators to underreport serious student misconduct.
In some states, new legislation already is trending toward giving teachers more authority to address student misbehavior.
Shaken by post-pandemic disruptions, some states take a harder line on school discipline

In West Virginia, for example, a new law creates a structured process for responding to violent, threatening or disruptive behavior among students in grades K-6.
Under the law, a student exhibiting such behavior can be immediately removed from class, evaluated by counselors or behavioral specialists and placed on an individualized behavior plan. If there’s no improvement after two rounds of intervention, the student could be moved into a behavioral intervention program or an alternative learning environment.
West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey, a Republican, and supporters say the law empowers teachers to maintain safe classrooms.
“This legislation provides teachers with the tools to regain control of the classroom and ensure safe learning environments for our kids,” Morrisey said at the bill’s signing.
In April, the Texas House of Representatives passed a bill referred to as the “Teacher’s Bill of Rights” with a bipartisan vote of 124-20.
That bill, now sitting in the Senate’s education committee, would significantly expand the grounds for out-of-school suspensions, allowing students to be suspended for repeated disruptions or threats beginning in third grade. It would reverse earlier changes that limited suspensions for younger students. It also would mandate that students making terroristic threats or assaulting school employees be placed in alternative education programs for at least 30 days.
Texas civil rights groups argue that the bill would impose a one-size-fits-all punitive approach, rather than addressing students’ developmental and behavioral needs.
Alycia Castillo, associate director of policy at the Texas Civil Rights Project and a former teacher, said state lawmakers are taking the wrong approach by mandating sweeping discipline policies for a state as diverse as Texas.










Children are naturally disruptive — that’s part of their development.


– Alycia Castillo, associate director of policy at the Texas Civil Rights Project


During the 2020-21 school year, according to the latest data available from the U.S. Department of Education, Black students faced the highest rates of disciplinary action across all categories — suspension and expulsion — among all racial and ethnic groups.
They were 39% more likely than white students to receive in-school suspensions, 70% more likely to face out-of-school suspensions, and 71% more likely to be expelled.
The disparities were even starker for Black students with disabilities, who experienced suspension and expulsion rates far exceeding those of both their white peers and non-disabled students.
Reviving old, harsh disciplinary policies risks disproportionately harming students of color, students with disabilities and those from low-income backgrounds, Castillo said.
“What works in Austin may not work in West Texas,” Castillo said.
“Children are naturally disruptive — that’s part of their development,” she added. “Excluding them only harms their growth into functional adults.”
 Restorative justice models

In recent years, some other states have passed laws promoting restorative practices in schools, in which students and teachers work through problems and focus on repairing the harm caused by disruptions or conflict.
Trump’s school choice push adds to momentum in statehouses

Michigan’s 2017 law requires schools to consider restorative approaches before suspensions or expulsions, aiming to repair harm rather than exclude students. Nevada began mandating restorative justice approaches in 2019, but scaled back that approach in 2023.
This year, Maryland passed a law requiring the state to establish “restorative practices schools,” specific schools with trained educators who use the approach in everyday discipline.
Kimberly Hellerich, an assistant professor at Sacred Heart University and a former K-12 teacher, said discipline policies should go beyond punitive measures to foster accountability and community healing.
“Adding restorative practices to accompany codes of conduct can allow students to recognize the impact of their actions on themselves, peers, the teacher, the class and the school community,” Hellerich said.
In her own classrooms, Hellerich used what she called “community circles” to guide students in processing behavior, offering apologies and rebuilding trust. “The apology served as a way to restore the student’s relationship with the entire class community,” she said.
 Calls for a cultural shift on expectations

While lawmakers debate discipline procedures, other education advocates warn that an even deeper issue is unfolding inside classrooms: the gradual erosion of behavioral expectations and academic rigor.










Discipline is the backbone of effective learning.


– Jessica Bartnick, co-founder and CEO of Foundation for C.H.O.I.C.E.


Jessica Bartnick, co-founder and CEO of the Dallas-based mentorship program Foundation for C.H.O.I.C.E., said that declining school discipline and lowered standards are quietly undermining educational outcomes.
“Discipline is the backbone of effective learning,” Bartnick, who supports the Texas legislation, told Stateline in an email. “Without it, classrooms become chaotic, instructional time is lost and teachers are forced to shift their focus from instruction to behavior management.”
Bartnick said efforts to promote equity sometimes inadvertently lower behavioral standards and deprive teachers of the tools they need to maintain safe learning environments.
She also criticized lenient grading policies and unlimited test retakes, arguing that they diminish the value of preparation, responsibility and resilience.
“If students are shielded from the discomfort of failure, they are also shielded from the growth that comes with it,” she wrote. “If we want to prepare students for a world that will not offer endless second chances, we must return to a classroom culture grounded in discipline, responsibility, and rigor.”

Sears/Maryland Matters)Dozens of police-custody deaths that were ruled accidental or of unknown causes have been reclassified as homicides after a four-year review of more than 1,300 cases handled by former Maryland State Medical Examiner Dr. David Fowler.
The results of that review, announced Thursday, also highlighted potential racial and pro-police biases in the medical examiner’s office at the time that may have contributed to the mischaracterizations.
The audit, led by Towson University psychology professor Jeff Kukucka, looked at roughly 1,300 in-custody deaths between 2003 and 2019 — a period corresponding with Fowler’s time leading the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME). Attorney General Anthony Brown (D), who announced the findings with Kukucka and Gov. Wes Moore (D), said the report raises “profound concerns, and they are well founded in the audit.”
“The audit report’s findings reveal significant discrepancies that demand our attention and response,” Brown said.
“Our research has determined that OCME was especially unlikely to classify death as a homicide if the decedent was Black or if they died after being restrained by police,” Brown said. “These findings have profound implications across our justice system. They speak to systemic issues rather than individual conduct.”

The audit, released Thursday afternoon, will be presented Friday to the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine.
“The findings of this audit are deeply concerning.,” Moore said. “It’s going to take time to digest a report prepared over the course of four years and two different administrations.
“But if there’s one takeaway that we’ve already drawn at this very early stage is this: We have to make sure we are continuing to make Maryland a model for public safety and transparency and equal justice under the law, and one is not more important than the other,” he said.
Moore said the audit is the first of its kind in the nation, and should set “the standard for what this type of investigation can, and what this type of investigation should, look like” in other states.
“Blazing new trails is never easy,” Kukucka said, “but someone has to lead the way, and we believe that Maryland can and will be that leader in terms of strengthening death investigations across the country.
“We hope that our rigorous audit procedure will provide a blueprint for other states to conduct similar audits, and that implementing our recommendations will establish Maryland’s OCME as a gold standard to which other agencies can aspire,” he said.




Police-custody deaths get a second look
The audit released by the Office of the Attorney General included the names of 41 people who died soon after being restrained by police. The majority included an “undetermined” cause of death ruling. As a result of the audit, all 41 are reclassified as homicides.

The review began in 2021, sparked by an outcry over Fowler’s testimony in the trial of Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin, who was convicted of murder in the 2020 death of George Floyd during an arrest. As part of that arrest, Chauvin knelt for up to nine minutes on the neck of Floyd, who said repeatedly that he could not breathe.
Fowler, who resigned as the chief medical examiner in 2019, was called as an expert witness for Chauvin. He testified that Floyd’s death was caused by “excited delirium,” rather than police actions.
Excited delirium was a catchall term used to describe aggressive behaviors related to mental health or substance abuse issues. It has been disavowed by the American Medical Association and the National Association of Medical Examiners.
Fowler came under fire for his testimony in the highly publicized case. The audit was triggered by a 2021 letter from 450 medical experts, who called on Maryland officials to investigate deaths in police custody and practices in the medical examiner’s office under Fowler.
“These members of the medical community were concerned that our state’s death determination has been tainted by racial or pro law enforcement bias, or were otherwise inconsistent with the standard practices for investigating and certifying in custody deaths,” Brown said.
Among the report’s findings: Excited delirium or the synonymous agitated delirium was cited in the death statements made by Fowler’s office in 42 of the more than 80 in-custody deaths that came shortly after an episode of police restraint.
Researchers reviewing the initial 1,300 in-custody deaths focused on 84 cases of individuals who died soon after being restrained by police. Those cases were reviewed by 12 forensic pathologists, randomly divided into three-member panels. Sensitive and identifying information about the dead, including race, was redacted from reports reviewed by the teams.
In all, the teams disagreed with 41 cause-of-death determinations issued by Fowler’s office. In 36 of those cases, all three panel members determined the cause of death to be homicide; in the remaining five, two of the three experts called the death a homicide.
In 34 of those cases, the medical examiner’s office reported that the cause and manner of death was undetermined. Five were ruled accidental and another two were ruled death by natural causes.
“Those discrepancies suggest that OCME practices during the audits time frame were out of step with national standards for death certification, namely the ‘but for’ standard, which states that any death resulting from the actions of another person, regardless of that person’s intent, should be classified as a homicide,” Kukucka said.
“As a result, it appears that OCME undercounted restraint-related homicides during the audit time frame,” he said.  “We also found that they undercounted homicides even more in cases where the decedent was Black or was restrained by police, which raises the possibility of racial and pro-police bias.”
Those deaths have now been reclassified as homicides. Of the 41 cases, 14 occurred in Baltimore City and five each were in Baltimore, Montgomery and Prince George’s counties.
Officials cautioned that the reclassifications do not equal a finding of criminal activity or culpability. Instead, it means that the deaths occurred as the result of the action of another person.
“There’s no suggestion that anyone is currently culpable, but it’s our responsibility to go through these files, beyond the OCME report, beyond the medical and the original forensic examination, look at the entire file, which means engaging law enforcement as well to make determination,” Brown said.
Kukucka stressed the report comes with two caveats.
First, the review is retrospective, looking at a specific period of time. The most recent case reviewed is six years old. Kukucka said that “makes it impossible to know whether racial or pro-police biases truly affected OCME determinations. Those disparities could instead reflect factors other than bias.”
And he repeated Brown’s caution that the findings do not imply criminal wrongdoing or liability.
In addition to the release of the report and broader review of the deaths at the county level, officials announced a series of reforms meant to improve death investigations within the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner.

Moore, prior to the release of the report, signed an executive order directing Brown’s office to work with state’s attorneys to review each case. Those reviews could potentially lead to reopening investigations.
Moore also ordered the Maryland Department of Health to work with the medical examiner’s office to implement best-practice investigation policies. The department is ordered to report on its progress by Dec. 31, 2026.
Finally, Moore’s order creates a new task force to work on policies to reduce in-custody police restraint deaths. That panel will include health and legal experts, law enforcement and community members
“Maryland was the first state in the nation to launch a comprehensive audit on the office of chief medical examiner, and today, we are proud that we’ll also become the first state in the nation to respond to such an audit with swift and targeted action,” Moore said.
“I hope that our work will inspire others around the country to take similar steps as we work together to strengthen our system of justice,” he said.

,California,2025-05-16 07:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,Democratic candidates for California governor shy away from state’s anti-oil crusade,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/05/democrats-california-governor-oil-unions/,All of the Democratic contenders for California governor promised unions they would be less aggressive than Gov. Gavin Newsom has been with oil industry.,"The most interesting moment of Monday’s labor union-sponsored interrogation of seven declared Democratic candidates for governor was their response to a question from the union representing oil refinery workers.
They were asked: “As governor, would you be pragmatic to stop targeting California’s oil and gas industry in ways that jeopardize union jobs and force us to rely on dirty or imported energy?”
The question stems the state’s intention to eliminate petroleum-based fuels over the next two decades and recent announcements that two of the state’s nine refineries will soon be closed.
Virtually every candidate signaled “yes.” Antonio Villaraigosa, the former mayor of Los Angeles, offered the most complete answer.
“We can’t continue to be a party of just people that drive a Tesla, not a Toyota pickup, or ride a bus like my mother did,” he said. “We’re putting this notion of just renewables on the backs of working people. We have the highest gas prices in the United States of America. We have the second-highest utility costs.”
As Villaraigosa implied, were refinery closures to continue, it could be a double economic whammy. Refinery workers would lose their highly paid jobs and the squeeze on fuel supplies could increase California’s already-high prices at the pump.
Michael Bernick, an employment attorney who once led the state Employment Development Department, studied the impacts of previous refinery closures and found that promises of converting refinery jobs to well-paying alternative employment didn’t pan out.
Bernick, in a Forbes magazine article this month, wrote that “despite generous amounts of government funding for retraining and re-employment, few of the laid-off workers were able to obtain new jobs at anywhere near their previous wages, and a high number remained unemployed, more than a year after closure.”
Two more refinery closures could hit consumers hard, according to an analysis by University of Southern California economist Michael Mische. Importing replacement supplies would be difficult, and shortages could push gas prices beyond $8 a gallon within the next couple of years.
“California can ill afford the loss of one refinery, let alone two,” Mische writes, adding, “The collective consequence of the pending refinery exits to the Golden State is potentially devastating to California’s economic growth and status as the fourth largest economy, in nominal terms, in the world. With the announced shutdown of Valero’s Benicia refinery complex accompanied by its $1.1 billion charge-off, California is confronting a potential 21% reduction in collective refining capacity from 2023 to April 2026.”
Mische also notes out that gasoline or diesel supplies and prices are not the only factors in California’s reduced refinery capacity. California provides much of the fuel consumed in Nevada and Arizona and the state’s many military bases also depend on California refineries to fuel their airplanes, ships and vehicles.
Mische’s bottom line:
“Based on current demand and consumption assumptions and estimates, the combined consequences of the 2025 Phillips 66 refinery closure and the April 2026 Valero refinery closure, together with the potential impact of legislative actions…the estimated average consumer price of regular gasoline could potentially increase by as much as 75% from the April 23, 2025, price of $4.816 to $7.348 to $8.435 a gallon by calendar year end 2026.”
The Newsom administration has been trying to persuade the media that Mische’s numbers are biased because he once advised Saudi Arabia on energy policy, but has not offered any economic analysis to refute his findings. A warming climate, of course, hastened by emissions, comes with disaster risks.
There’s no sugarcoating the impacts of energy conversion on both oil industry workers and consumers and managing it will be the next governor’s most perilous political and economic minefield. One misstep could be disastrous.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/051225_Governors-Event_FG_CM_41.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-16 04:01:17.077279

Special prosecutor Nathan Wade stood to her left. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderA new Georgia law clarifies the power of legislative committees to issue subpoenas following a legal battle between Republican state senators and Democratic Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis.
The signing of Senate Bill 255 by Gov. Brian Kemp on Wednesday enacted a law that defines the power of state legislative committees to compel witnesses to testify and provide evidence.
Kemp issued an unusual signing statement warning state lawmakers to use the new law with discretion. The statement says that the law provides clear procedures for issuing subpoenas rather than creating new responsibilities for the General Assembly.
Kemp urged lawmakers to proceed with caution when using the tool for investigations.
“The General Assembly has a well-earned reputation for putting the business of legislating—and the people of Georgia—first,” Kemp wrote. “Americans of all political leanings have lamented the ineffectiveness of the United States Congress, in no small part due to the abundance of politically motivated ‘investigations’ which only generate sound bites and distract from important legislation.”
 Athens Sen. Bill Cowsert introduced the bill this year as a response to a prolonged legal battle as Willis refused to appear before a special committee he chairs investigating Willis for potential financial and ethical violations related to the Fulton County 2020 election interference investigation.  
Republican supporters of the new law claim that it does not expand current legislative powers, but rather explains how committees are able to legally exercise their subpoena powers. 
Democratic lawmakers opposed the bill, citing the possibility that investigative legislative committees would misuse their subpoena powers against perceived political opponents, such as elected officials and public advocacy groups.
Under the new law, any dispute over the enforcement of the state lawmakers’ subpoena would be resolved by a local superior court.

The Senate Special Committee on Investigations case is at a standstill awaiting a final court order to determine whether Willis will be required to testify. The committee is also requesting that Willis turn over a trove of documents and other evidence as of their investigation. 
Willis came under fire last year when she admitted to a romantic relationship with the special prosecutor she hired to lead the sweeping felony election interference case following former President Joe Biden’s 2020 election victory over Republican Donald Trump.
The Fulton district attorney was disqualified last year due to prosecutorial misconduct allegations involving her romantic relationship with Nathan Wade, the special prosecutor who brought the case against Trump and 18 of his allies accused of illegally trying to overturn Georgia’s election results.
Cowsert’s Senate Special Committee on Investigations is expected to expand its list of targets this year as it opens a probe into the relationship between Stacey Abrams and New Georgia Project following a Jan. 15 settlement in a 2019 case alleging illegal campaign contributions to Abrams’ 2018 Democratic gubernatorial campaign.
Cowsert, a lawyer, launched his campaign to become Georgia’s next attorney general this spring by proclaiming his “fearless commitment to law and order” which included leading investigations into allegations of unethical conduct by Willis and financial improprieties between Abrams-related groups.
“DA Fani Willis, NY AG Letitia James, and other partisan prosecutors have undermined public confidence in the fairness of our criminal justice system,” Cowsert said. “Their abuse of power is a threat to the rule of law, and it’s time to put an end to the weaponization of our justice system.”

(Photo by Eduardo Martinez/FEMA)Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D) has yet to sign the legislature’s biggest energy bill into law, but there is already a campaign in the works to challenge the measure at referendum.
A group calling itself the Maryland Environment, Labor, and Industry Coalition filed as a ballot issue committee Tuesday with the State Board of Elections, signaling its intent to begin gathering signatures to get the issue on the ballot in November 2026 if it is not vetoed.
The bill, called the Next Generation Energy Act, includes a variety of provisions aimed at greasing the skids for more in-state power generation and storage, amid soaring energy bills in Maryland. It also nixed a subsidy for trash incinerators that generate energy: Since 2011, Maryland had considered that renewable energy, making incinerator operators eligible to sell millions in credits each year.
Doug Gansler, the former Maryland attorney general now in private practice, said the referendum “has to overturn the entire bill,” but that the waste-to-energy provisions would be a focus for the ballot campaign.
“There’s a lot of good pieces in the bill, but there’s a lot of components of the bill that people are not enamored with — and some that are just bad,” said Gansler, who said he was approached to provide legal services for the group.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Getting on the ballot is no easy task: The coalition will need to collect just over 20,000 verified signatures from supporters by May 31 at 11:59 p.m. It would need to collect about 40,000 more by the end of the day June 30.
The last time a legislative act was challenged at referendum was in 2012, when voters petitioned to get same-sex marriage on the ballot. Voters approved the measure by a slim margin.
It wasn’t immediately clear Thursday which groups formed the coalition. Campaign filings listed Rebecca Smondrowski as chair and Samir Malhotra as treasurer. Both have Montgomery County addresses.
Smondrowski is a former Montgomery County school board member, and Malhotra described himself as a small business owner frustrated by high energy costs. (He said he is not the former chief of staff to Gov. Larry Hogan (R), who shares the same name.)
Gansler cautioned that the campaign is still in its infancy.

“The hope is that the governor vetoes the bill. That’s what everyone hopes and thinks should happen,” Gansler said. “If and when he does not, then we’ll kind of figure things out.”
Moore has one final bill signing scheduled on May 20. A spokesperson declined to comment on his plans for the legislation, which was part of a three-bill energy package supported by Democratic leadership in the House and Senate.
Republican legislators have argued that the bill does little to curb rising rates, and doesn’t go far enough to incentivize new power generation, including nuclear and natural gas.
Some environmental and consumer advocacy groups considered the Next Generation bill a mixed bag. On one hand, its provisions could streamline a new natural gas-fired power plant in Maryland, despite the state’s push to shift to renewable energy such as wind and solar. But it also included provisions expediting battery energy storage, and curtailing utilities’ spending on natural gas infrastructure, as well as private jets and industry association memberships, using ratepayer dollars.
The bill would also dole out an $80 rebate, on average, to every Maryland ratepayer, to make up for high costs.
The provision cutting trash-burning from the state’s renewable energy portfolio has the support of many high-profile environmental groups, who argue that the state should focus on subsidizing other generation that does not generate air pollution, such as wind and solar power. But it also garnered fierce opposition, including from the state’s two current incinerators.
In 2023, the last year for which data is publicly available, those incinerators — one in Montgomery County and one in Baltimore City — each received funds, as did another incinerator in Virginia. The incinerators accounted for 14.2% of “renewable energy credits” purchased by electricity suppliers, for a total of about $27 million.
The Waste-to-Energy Association, which represents incineration companies nationally, said in a statement Thursday that it is not driving the new ballot campaign, but it supports the effort.
“While Maryland is facing an energy crisis resulting in an unreliable grid and skyrocketing costs, the bill removes support for the dependable energy generated from waste,” wrote Thomas Hogan, the association’s president.

“This bill is reckless and while we did not create the ballot committee, we will happily join this effort,” Hogan wrote. “In the meantime, we urge Governor Moore to veto this bill so that lawmakers can develop real solutions to our energy challenges.”
WIN Waste, which operates the incinerator in South Baltimore, said it was not aware of the ballot committee, but “considered the option” itself, according to spokesperson Mary Urban. 
“The negative impact to the industry, in-state energy generation and Maryland ratepayers cannot be overstated — not to mention the State’s economic and climate goals,” Urban wrote.
The company has argued that burning waste should be subsidized in part because it is more environmentally friendly than landfilling, especially since waste may have to be transported longer distances from the Baltimore region to a dump. WIN Waste has also cited about $45 million in recent facility upgrades to curb air pollution from its smokestack along Interstate 95.
Complicating the already short timeline for gathering signatures is uncertainty about whether electronic signatures can be used to reach the cutoff, in addition to signatures gathered in-person, Gansler said. The total signature requirement is 3% of the voters in the last gubernatorial election, or 60,157, all of whom must be Maryland registered voters.
Since the last ballot referendum in 2012, the state’s reliance on electronic signatures and electronic filings has increased, Gansler said.
“There’s a strong case legally that e-signatures may suffice, and we’re looking into that now,” Gansler said, adding that electronic signatures would “make a challenging deadline far less challenging.”
If the issue reaches the ballot, Gansler said his clients are optimistic that they will succeed. They point to a February poll from the Institute of Politics at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. It found a majority of the 800 Maryland voters surveyed supported a variety of energy generation types, with the exception of coal, with 68% in favor of trash incinerators helping to increase the state’s power generation.
“Once the referendum gets on the ballot, it will pass,” Gansler said. “It will get overturned.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/4257160-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-05-16 04:01:17.077279

Goldstein Treasury Building in Annapolis. (File photo by Danielle E. Gaines/Maryland Matters.)Fitch Ratings reaffirmed Maryland’s AAA bond rating Thursday afternoon, just one day after Moody’s rocked state leaders by downgrading its rating of the state’s creditworthiness after more than 50 years.
In reaffirming its highest rating, Fitch noted elevated liabilities for the state that “are carefully managed and moderate relative to the economic resource base. The state’s economy benefits from its proximity to the nation’s capital, with a large federal presence and associated private contracting.”
The rating firm also noted the state’s “unlimited legal authority to raise” taxes.
“Revenue growth prospects are expected to remain strong and comparable with overall U.S. economic growth over the long term. Risk from reliance on personal income tax is mitigated by a robust federal institutional presence,” Fitch analysts wrote in the analysis.
But Fitch noted concerns about the state’s “rising spending demands with recurring revenues,” particularly state spending on public school education. The firm said the state’s “inability to effectively manage rising spending demands with recurring revenues”could “weaken Fitch’s assessments of either the state’s expenditure framework or operating performance.”
Retiree benefits may also lead to a downgrade should there be “a material increase,” Fitch said.
Fitch has given Maryland its highest credit ranking since 1993.
Maryland loses coveted Aaa bond rating

The Fitch rating runs counter to one released Wednesday by Moody’s, considered a gold standard rating agency. Moody’s downgraded its Aaa rating for Maryland to Aa1, the first downgrade since 1973. The change meant the state lost its treasured triple AAA creditworthiness rating — Standard & Poor’s, the third major bond-rating firm, has given Maryland an AAA rating since 1961.
But Moody’s had been telegraphing its position for months. It took a dim view of the state’s over-reliance on federal agencies and employment, and its lack of a diverse economy that was less susceptible to President Donald Trump’s slashing of federal budgets, agencies and workforce.
Last year, Moody’s affirmed its triple-A rating for the state, but downgraded its outlook from stable to negative, citing concerns about spending, including public school funding. In March, the company issued another report naming Maryland the state most at risk as a result of federal budget and job cuts.
Moody’s had given Maryland an Aaa rating every year since 1973 — until Wednesday.
Its downgrade of Maryland “was driven by economic and financial underperformance compared to Aaa-rated states, which is expected to continue given the state’s heightened vulnerability to shifting federal policies and employment, and its elevated fixed costs,” Moody’s said in its report.
State officials reacted angrily to the downgrade and blamed the uncertainty caused by Trump despite billions in deficits over the next five years that were projected in December and January, before Trump was sworn in.
Prior to Wednesday’s announcement, Maryland was one of 14 states to have the highest rating from the three major agencies — Fitch, Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s.
Credit ratings, which are updated annually, determine how much interest the state — and its taxpayers — pay on billions of dollars borrowed for roads, bridges, schools and other infrastructure.
With Fitch reaffirming its confidence in the state, it is unclear if the Moody’s downgrade will affect the interest rates available to Maryland.

(Screenshot)The board overseeing implementation of the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future approved a plan Thursday for the state Department of Education and the Maryland Higher Education Commission to collaborate on programs certifying teachers.
Approval by the Accountability and Implementation Board (AIB), which oversees the multibillion-dollar plan, comes amid an ongoing shortages of teachers, in Maryland and nationwide.
In January, the Blueprint board cited the teacher shortage as the reason behind its recommendation that the state delay the start of collaborative time, which gives teachers more out-of-classroom time to plan, work with other teachers, analyze student data and more. In order to implement it, education leaders have said it would require the hiring of at least 12,000 additional teachers by next year.
The General Assembly eventually approved Blueprint legislation last month to delay the collaborative time requirement, but kept the funding in place for students.
‘Blueprint’ bill that avoids some of the most severe education cuts is signed into law

As for the joint plan with the department and commission, the Blueprint board outlined two strengths: It leverages existing structures for state and national accreditation to evaluate preparation programs and higher education institutions; and provides a detailed schedule of activities and how Blueprint requirements will be integrated.
According to a Jan. 31 document signed by State Superintendent Carey Wright and Higher Education Secretary Sanjay Rai, the review of educator preparation programs at various institutions would be done in stages starting this fiscal year through fiscal 2030.
A board summary in “areas for growth and improvement” urged the agencies to complete their assessments much sooner, and to integrate self-reporting measures and coordinate those with Blueprint requirements to annually collect data. The department and commission agreed and will report their first set of data by Oct. 1, 2026.
“Receiving this self-reporting on an annual basis will allow us to monitor progress until we receive those accreditation reviews,” said AIB Executive Director Rachel Hise. “Staff with be reviewing all of that and sharing it with the board.”
The AIB approved the plan unanimously. Board member Jennifer Lynch, who works as an associate vice chancellor for education and engagement at the University System of Maryland, recused herself from the vote.
The AIB already approved school system Blueprint plans earlier this year, but state law requires the board to have various state agencies develop implementation plans that are elements of the Blueprint.The joint agencies’ plan coincides with pillar two of the Blueprint, to hire and retain high-quality and diverse teachers and leaders.
Also Thursday, the AIB announced dates next month for public meetings for anyone who wants to recommend changes to the overall Blueprint comprehensive plan. State law requires that any changes to the plan must be made annually by Aug. 1.

A meeting on on college and career readiness facets of the plan will be held June 17 from 3-4:30 p.m., followed by the meeting on high-quality and diverse teachers and leaders from 5-6 p.m. The meeting on providing more resources for students to be successful will be held June 24 from 4-5:30 p.m.

In other business, Hise announced that board member Mara Doss plans to resign June 30. Doss, a former associate vice president for teaching, learning and student success at Prince George’s Community College, had one year left in her term. Appointments are set to expire July 1 for board members Laura Stapleton and Joseph Manko.
Stapleton, who chairs the Human Development and Quantitative Methodology Department at the University of Maryland, College Park, said Thursday she doesn’t plan to come back.
“I will not be putting my name in the hat, so there will definitely be [a] vacancy for those folks out there who are considering applying,” she said. “It’s not a waste of time to apply. It’s an exciting opportunity, and I encourage folks to put their name out there.”
An AIB nominating committee will solicit applications for those who want to serve on the seven-member board, including Manko if he wants to reapply.
Hise said the committee is scheduled to meet next week to announce a timeline on when and how applicants can apply.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/05/Blueprint-AIB-meeting-5-15-2025.jpg,,,2025-05-16 04:01:17.077279
,Maryland Matters,2025-05-16 05:02:32+00:00,Maryland Matters,Maryland could finally get a strategic energy planning resource. Now what?,Alex Pavlak,,,,,https://marylandmatters.org/2025/05/16/maryland-could-finally-get-a-strategic-energy-planning-resource-now-what/,"Maryland has never lacked ambition when it comes to clean and renewable energy standards, but it has lacked a coherent strategy to manage all those goals, writes Alex Pavlak, who hopes creation of a Strategic Energy Planning Office changes that.","The coal-fired Chalk Point power plant in Prince George’s County was closed as part of a regional program to limit emissions from power plants. (Photo courtesy Integration and Application Network, University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science)During the 2025 legislative session, Maryland lawmakers took a pivotal step by approving the Strategic Energy Planning Office (SEPO) through Senate Bill 909 and House Bill 1037. If the governor signs them into law next week, it would mark the first time that Maryland climate law explicitly references strategy and risk — a long-overdue acknowledgement.
But establishing SEPO is just the beginning.
For SEPO to fulfill its promise, it must be staffed with technical experts who prioritize data, systems thinking and realism over purely aspirational policy. It needs people who do not care what the answer is but know how to build systems that work. Equally important, Maryland’s leadership must begin to think strategically — something that’s been largely missing from past efforts.
The Climate Solutions Now Act of 2022 set ambitious goals: net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2045 and a 60% reduction from 2006 levels by 2031. These are bold and necessary targets. But they came without the tools to evaluate feasibility, assess risks, or recommend viable pathways. There was no dedicated team asking the hard questions: Is 2045 realistic? What options exist? What could go wrong?
Instead, the approach often resembled throwing spaghetti at the wall: Policies were introduced without robust analysis or evidence. That might work for low-stakes problems, but it’s no match for the complexity of Maryland’s energy system—especially in the context of our interdependence with PJM, the regional transmission organization that operates the power grid across multiple states.

The results speak for themselves: Maryland’s climate programs are increasingly out of sync with one another. Our participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) has rendered in-state fossil fuel plants noncompetitive with non-RGGI PJM states. That’s good for local emissions — but how do we keep the lights on?
This summer’s electricity price spikes were driven by PJM’s decision to subsidize aging coal plants and delay the retirement of natural gas facilities to maintain grid reliability. Meanwhile, another white paper claims that emissions in PJM’s RGGI states — including Maryland, Delaware, and New Jersey — are rising, not falling. And Maryland’s own Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) targets remain out of reach.
SEPO is an urgent response to these issues. Its initial charge is risk assessment, but the bigger opportunity lies in strategic development.
Traditionally, strategy is the domain of the executive branch — not the legislature — and SEPO fills a long-standing gap. With a clear mission and the right talent, it can serve as a systems-level resource to help Maryland see the full energy picture: How the pieces fit together, what the trade-offs are, and how to build a functional, affordable and low-carbon grid.
Maryland has never lacked ambition. The Greenhouse Gas Reduction Act of 2016 set a 25% renewable electricity goal by 2020. The POWER Act — Promoting Offshore Wind Energy Resources — of 2023 called for 8,500 megawatts of offshore wind (OSW) by 2031. These are inspiring milestones. But they’re not a plan. Neither goal, alone or together, ensures a clean, affordable, and reliable energy future.
Take offshore wind, for example. While promising, we still lack solid evidence that it can serve as a foundational pillar of a 100% clean grid. In Ontario, Canada, over 50% of wind energy is discarded because it’s the cheapest way to meet demand — but not necessarily the most effective. Maryland’s own Power Plant Research Program 100% Study couldn’t conclude that 100% renewables are viable without backup from PJM. Yet, we continue to award OSW contracts and make long-term commitments without fully understanding the risks or alternatives.
This isn’t planning — it’s hoping.
The concept of net-zero, as originally defined by the IPCC, means a balance between GHG emissions and removals. As a strategic goal, it’s a sound target. There are many ways to decarbonize, each with its own costs, constraints and dependencies — especially given Maryland’s reliance on PJM.
A strategic approach, grounded in systems engineering, begins by envisioning what a net-zero future could look like. Then, it works backward: What assets do we already have? What needs to be built? What must be retired? What’s missing?
SEPO is Maryland’s chance to do that work. But it must evolve beyond risk management into a true strategic energy office. That means hiring people who understand energy systems — generation, transmission, storage, markets and reliability — and who can plan for the long term.
Policymakers have a role, too. They must champion clean-energy goals while grappling with trade-offs, understanding constraints, and communicating honestly with the public — not just about benefits, but about costs and risks.
This isn’t ideology. It’s pragmatism. With SEPO properly staffed and supported, Maryland can finally move from wishful thinking to fact-based planning.
Net-zero is within reach—if we plan for it.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/iil-bw-xx-cb-ian-aj-0013_0-newsletter-1024x632.jpg,,,2025-05-16 04:01:17.077279

Talks resumed on Thursday between NJ Transit and its rail engineers' union in an attempt to reach an agreement to avert a walkout by the union scheduled for early Friday. NJ Transit is the nation's third-largest transit system; it operates buses and rail in the state, which serve nearly 1 million weekday trips. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Locomotive engineers at NJ Transit launched a strike early Friday morning that will stall rail service across the state as contract negotiations that have worn on for more than five years remain stalled over a wage dispute.
The strike will completely stop the agency’s rail service, including Metro-North Railroad lines west of the Hudson River, from 12:01 a.m. Friday, and union members will form picket lines across the system later Friday.
Gov. Phil Murphy and NJ Transit CEO Kris Kolluri pinned the blame for the strike on the union, saying the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen asked for salary increases that would force NJ Transit to give similar pay hikes to all of its other unions and bankrupt the agency. Union officials, meanwhile, said NJ Transit has allowed the engineers’ wages to fall well below what engineers for other railroads are paid.
“NJ Transit just remains unwilling to bridge that gap,” said Tom Haas, general chairman for the NJ Transit engineers union.
The last NJ Transit work stoppage occurred in 1983 and lasted 34 days.
NJ Transit’s contingency plan for the strike includes shuttle service to the Port Authority Bus Terminal or to PATH stations in Newark and Harrison in the morning, with return trips in the afternoon and early evening, along with increased bus service to large stations. Amtrak trains will continue to run on the northeast corridor.
The agency has said the plan, forecast to cost about $4 million per day, could offer transit to roughly 20% of NJ Transit rail customers.
“For the rest of them, we’re going to ask for your patience, and if you’re able to work from home, we really would ask you to do that,” Kolluri said at a press conference late Thursday at Newark Penn Station.
Haas said NJ Transit walked away from the negotiation table two hours before the Thursday 11:59 p.m. deadline to reach a deal (the Newark Penn Station press conference was called for 10:30 p.m.).
“We presented them the last proposal, they rejected it and walked away with two hours left on the clock,” he said.
Kolluri said approving the union’s proposal would trigger what’s known as a “me too” clause in NJ Transit’s contracts with its other unions, forcing the agency to award all of its unionized employees the same pay hikes granted to the engineers. Murphy said Thursday that would cost the agency $100 million or more.
Haas disputed that, saying the union’s proposal calls for cost savings in other areas that would allow NJ Transit to avoid honoring the “me too” clause in the other contracts.
Kolluri said recent talks had been productive and appeared to indicate a resolution could come soon.
“I’m going to suggest to you that this is not a lost cause. This is an imminently achievable deal,” Kolluri said.
The agency has offered pattern wage increases that align with those awarded to its 14 other unions. Those increases would raise engineers’ salaries by 23% over eight compounding increases ranging between 2% and 3% across seven years.
The union has sought increases that are two percentage points larger and would result in a 43.5% wage increase over the seven-year term. They’ve also sought three additional years of 5% raises that would bring the overall increase to about 66.2%.
Negotiations between the two parties spilled into public acrimony last week, but the two sides moderated their public campaigns as negotiations entered their final days this week. Both sides signaled a willingness to return to the bargaining table.
“If they’re willing to meet tonight, I’ll meet them again tonight. If they want to meet tomorrow morning, I’ll do it again because I think this is an imminently workable problem,” Kolluri said. “The question is, do they have the willingness to come to a solution.”
The National Mediation Board, a federal body that oversaw the dispute for years at an earlier stage, invited the two sides to negotiate on Sunday, agency and union officials said.
“Any time that they have a proposal to bring to us that addresses the wage inequality that New Jersey Transit locomotive engineers face, we’ll be more than happy to sit down and talk with them for as long as it takes to reach a deal,” Haas said.
A shortage of locomotive engineers was a major source of train cancellations and delays earlier in Murphy’s tenure, though such cancellations fell precipitously as agency staffing improved.
Federal law prescribes strict processes for rail worker strikes, and Congress and President Donald Trump could still move to avert a strike by passing and signing legislation to impose a contract on locomotive engineers, as President Joe Biden did in late 2022, though neither Congress nor Trump have indicated they will intervene.

(Amy Dalrymple/North Dakota Monitor)Greenpeace wants a North Dakota judge to reduce the nearly $667 million in damages it was ordered to pay the developer of the Dakota Access Pipeline in March, arguing that the award is excessive and unreasonable.
A Morton County jury handed down the sum following a more than three-week trial earlier this year. Jurors found the environmental group at fault for damages related to protests against the pipeline in North Dakota in 2016 and 2017, and for publishing defamatory statements that harmed Energy Transfer’s business.
Greenpeace was one of many activist groups that backed the movement, which drew thousands to rural south-central North Dakota to protest in solidarity with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe.
Greenpeace denies Energy Transfer’s allegations and says the company only brought the lawsuit to chill environmental activism. The defendants have yet to appeal.
In the meantime, attorneys for Greenpeace have asked Southwest Judicial District Judge James Gion to slash the nearly $667 million award, claiming it exceeds statutory caps on damages and that the verdict is riddled with inconsistencies.
Jury finds Greenpeace at fault for protest damages, awards pipeline developer more than $660 million

“This is the poster child of where the court needs to step in,” Steven Caplow, an attorney representing Greenpeace, said in a Thursday morning remote hearing.
Energy Transfer says Gion should let the jury’s award stand. Trey Cox, an attorney representing the pipeline developer, called the damages “consistent with the evidence produced at trial and the law of the state of North Dakota.”
In North Dakota, a punitive damage award cannot exceed two times the compensatory damage award, or the amount granted to make up for financial losses a party suffered.
Greenpeace and Energy Transfer disagree as to whether the verdict meets this requirement. Caplow argued that the punitive damages must be reduced by roughly $43 million to be consistent with state law, while Cox said the damages don’t exceed the cap and ought to be left in place.
Greenpeace also claims the award includes costs that should actually be attributed to Energy Transfer or other third parties. Greenpeace maintains it only had six employees visit the protest camps, and that its presence was small compared to the many other activist groups that supported the movement.
Caplow argued that Energy Transfer without sufficient evidence is holding Greenpeace responsible for all damages the company incurred in connection to the protests. He said the award unfairly compensates Energy Transfer for expenses it sustained before any Greenpeace employees set foot in North Dakota, for example.
Greenpeace also alleges the jury form — which the jurors had to fill out to issue their verdict — was flawed in a way that inflated the damages attributed to the environmental group.
Before the jurors deliberated, Gion directed them to consider whether each damage Energy Transfer claimed was directly caused by Greenpeace, or whether and to what extent they resulted from the actions of another group. Despite this being part of the instructions, there wasn’t space on the form for the jury to conduct this analysis, Caplow said.
That meant jurors were deprived of an opportunity to voice whether they believe Energy Transfer or other groups shared responsibility for any of the $667 million award, Caplow argued.
Cox said Greenpeace could have proposed changes to the form to address this issue, but didn’t.
Greenpeace also asked Gion to remove hundreds of millions of dollars of defamation-related damages, claiming the award is not supported by the evidence presented at trial. The jury awarded Energy Transfer damages for statements Greenpeace published about the pipeline between November 2016 and June 2018.
The environmental group maintains that none of the statements are defamatory, but also says that even if they were, they cannot be held solely responsible for defamation. Greenpeace says the statements originated with other sources — including the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe — and were circulated by hundreds of other outlets well before it published anything about the pipeline.
Additionally, Greenpeace says a significant portion of the $667 million includes compensation for damages Energy Transfer did not formally request relief for, including some Greenpeace says the company referenced during trial but didn’t claim in its written complaint.

Energy Transfer disputes the notion that Gion has discretion to reduce the jury’s award.
Energy Transfer’s lawsuit is against three Greenpeace entities — Greenpeace USA, Greenpeace International and Greenpeace Fund. Greenpeace USA was found at fault for most of the claims brought by Energy Transfer. The jury did not find Greenpeace International and Greenpeace Fund responsible for on-the-ground harms committed by protesters, though it did find those entities responsible for defamation and interfering with Energy Transfer’s business. Additionally, the jury found Greenpeace USA and Greenpeace International liable for conspiracy.
Matt Kelly, an attorney representing Greenpeace Fund, said during Thursday’s hearing that the award against the organization should be tossed out. The jury ordered Greenpeace Fund to pay roughly $130 million despite the fact that it did not find the organization at fault for most of the major claims in the case, Kelly said.
“We were forced to litigate for seven years on claims where there was no basis for any liability against Greenpeace Fund,” Kelly said during the hearing. “The idea that we should be forced to bear those costs, at this point, is ridiculous.”
Greenpeace International in court filings argued similarly that the nearly $132 million in damages it was ordered to pay should be dropped.
Energy Transfer says that the awards are valid because the jury found both of the organizations at fault for interfering with the company’s business.
Gion took the motion under advisement. Greenpeace in separate motions has asked Gion to fully reverse the jury’s verdict. The parties are scheduled to reconvene for another hearing on May 27.
Greenpeace USA has announced its intent to appeal the verdict to the North Dakota Supreme Court.

The reality is that city families get a slim chance of a good education: not a choice, but a gamble.
Nobody asked for this. What families want—what every child deserves, and what suburban children get— is a neighborhood school that nurtures them, challenges their thinking, affirms their identity, and encourages their creativity. We want schools that are resourced to meet each student’s needs —academically, emotionally, and socially—and that are good, stable workplaces for the educators and staff who dedicate their lives to our children.
We want schools close to home, where children can walk or ride the bus without a long commute, and where working parents can reasonably step in when emergencies arise. We want our kids learning alongside their neighbors, building strong relationships that extend beyond the classroom and strengthen the fabric of our communities.
But in Hartford, and in many communities like ours —Black, brown, and low-income—that experience has been stripped away in the name of “school choice,” a policy that too often creates winners and losers in a system that should serve everyone. These schools are no “supplement” — they are a direct disruption of the public education system to make room for private entities and profit-driven actors.
This isn’t happening in a vacuum. Our public institutions —especially our schools— have been chronically underfunded for decades. Disinvestment from Black and brown communities has made public education a battleground where basic needs compete with one another. While families fight for school buildings without mold, for heat in the winter and cooling in the summer, public dollars are being siphoned away to charter operators and private interests that are not accountable to our communities and that prioritize profits and test scores over student well-being.
We cannot allow public funds to support schools with selective admissions criteria or those that exclude children based on ability, behavior, or need. Our public schools must serve every child —regardless of language, disability, or life circumstance. That includes ensuring students with disabilities have access to high-quality, in-district support so that specialized placements are reserved for the few students with the most intensive needs, not used as a way to further segregate our kids.
A just public education system invests in the success of all children by offering culturally affirming, anti-racist, and imaginative learning experiences. Our students deserve schools that reflect and respect who they are —staffed by educators who are well-supported, experienced, and reflective of the communities they serve.
The proliferation of new charter schools and the expansion of “choice” programs do not expand opportunity, they destabilize it, particularly for students in historically marginalized communities.
By draining essential funds from our existing public schools, they exacerbate inequities and create further barriers rather than dismantling them. These policies often divide communities along racial and socioeconomic lines, further straining systems already burdened by years of inequitable funding.
Neighborhood public schools work great for children in West Hartford and Glastonbury. They can work just as well for Hartford children. Instead of pursuing divisive experiments, we must focus on what we know works: fully and equitably funding our public schools, repairing neglected facilities in under-resourced areas, supporting our dedicated educators, and fostering joyful, rigorous learning environments where all children, regardless of their race, class, or ability can truly thrive.
A quality public education from early childhood to higher education is not a product in the marketplace—it is a human right. It’s time we treated it that way.

We’ve seen the trauma: residents who have been dropped during transfers, patients suffering from untreated pressure sores, individuals given the wrong medication, and others left neglected for hours due to short staffing. We’ve represented families who never imagined their loved one’s final chapter would include preventable pain and indignity.
These aren’t rare occurrences — they are systemic. And the numbers back that up. According to Medicare.gov’s “Find and Compare” feature, as of May 7, 2025, 86 of Connecticut’s 195 listed nursing homes have received just one or two stars out of their 5-star quality rankings. That should alarm every family with a loved one in long-term care. And now, with 5,700 unionized caregivers threatening to strike on May 27, the fragility of this entire system is on full display. 
The truth is simple and sobering: when corporate nursing homes underpay and undervalue the people who care for our most vulnerable, the families suffer the consequences. 
Low wages drive high turnover. Constantly rotating staff makes it harder to get familiar with resident care needs and build relationships with residents and spot early warning signs of illness or injury. Understaffed facilities are forced to rely on temporary or replacement workers who often lack the training and understanding to provide safe, consistent care. And when that happens, our most vulnerable suffer — sometimes irreparably.
The workers of SEIU 1199NE are not asking for luxury. They are asking for a livable wage. Their current pay, often between $18 and $22 per hour, does not reflect the skill, patience, and emotional labor required to care for frail, elderly, and disabled residents. They are seeking to raise base pay to $25 per hour and ultimately to $30 over time — a fair and necessary increase for professionals tasked with such critical responsibilities.
Let’s be clear: this is not a labor dispute. It is a public health issue. It is a patient safety issue. It is a moral issue.
Some industry leaders have pointed out that a strike — or even preparing for one — would cost millions in short-term expenses. That may be true. But the cost of chronic understaffing, inadequate care, and avoidable injuries will be far higher. As nursing home injury lawyers, we’ve seen the long-term financial, legal, and human consequences play out again and again and again in courtrooms, nursing home rooms, and grieving families’ living rooms.
Raising wages is a critical first step toward transforming elder care. Better pay can attract additional skilled workers, reduce turnover, and improve the standard of care. It would signal that Connecticut values both its aging population and the people who care for them.
We look forward to a future where nursing home caregivers are trained, respected, and paid like the healthcare professionals they are. A future where families feel confident entrusting their loved ones to facilities that are fully staffed, well-managed, and truly committed to dignity in aging.
We urge Connecticut’s leaders — in government, healthcare, and business — to treat this moment as an opportunity to invest in a better, safer, more humane system. Our seniors deserve nothing less. Neither do the people who dedicate their lives to caring for them.

For millions of low-income families, this isn’t hypothetical, it’s daily life. Without consistent access to fresh fruits and vegetables, healthy eating becomes a privilege instead of a right, and it’s our children who pay the highest price. 
Access to fresh fruits and vegetables is a critical issue for low-income families, as lack of nutritious food interferes with their ability to maintain healthy diets, which especially affects children and their growth, so policies aimed at expanding access to affordable produce are essential for improving public health and building a healthier future generation.


A few weeks ago I visited nOURish Bridgeport with my Community and Public Health class and being there gave me a personal insight into how low-income families of this community access food, especially fresh fruits and vegetables. nOURish is a direct service program that is volunteer-powered and a food-centered community that provides food to thousands of people per week. Something that makes nOURish different from other food pantries is that the people, or neighbors as they like to call them, get to shop around as if it were a grocery store. It allowed them to pick and choose the foods they wanted. nOURish also offers clothing and diapers to those who need them.

This experience made me realize just how many people struggle with food insecurity, even in our surrounding areas. What impacted me the most was the people who brought their children. These parents who so obviously loved their kids worked to keep smiles on their faces while they had been waiting for hours to get their food. It was amazing to see and even more amazing to be a part of it, even if it was just for a day. Their access to this is usually so limited and that’s something that we need to work to change. 
This session, the Connecticut legislature is considering HB06101, “An Act Concerning Medicaid Coverage Of Food As Medicine And Expanding Access To The Connecticut Farmers’ Market/women, Infants And Children Nutrition Program.” The point of the bill is to expand access to fruits and vegetables for families with low incomes. According to the latest bill text, this legislation proposes that the Commissioner of Social Services should seek a federal Medicaid waiver to provide coverage for produce prescriptions for Medicaid beneficiaries with nutrition-related chronic diseases, and also address barriers to participation in the Connecticut Farmers’ Market/Women, Infants and Children Nutrition Program administered by the Department of Agriculture.
This proposed bill addresses a community/public health need because access to fruits and vegetables is a large struggle for many low income families and it is important for the health of future generations that we make these resources more accessible. While the idea behind this bill is great and has a lot of promise, it’s unlikely to pass, given the financial pressures on Medicaid at both the state and federal levels. Even still, it is imperative that we continue to advocate for policies like this. Policies that prioritize preventive care and long-term health benefits. Investing in nutritious food today can help reduce future healthcare costs and create healthier communities for generations to come.
As a health science major who is passionate about proper nutrition and eating a well-balanced diet, this is something that I can’t help but advocate for. Especially for families with growing children, it is so important for these kids to get the nutrients they need through fruits and vegetables. A lack of access doesn’t just affect what’s on the dinner table. It affects energy levels, academic performance, long-term development, and overall well-being. It’s frustrating to see nutrition being treated as an afterthought when it should be seen as a foundation. 
If we want to raise healthier kids and build stronger communities, we need to start with the basics, and that begins with access to fresh, affordable food.

Jeremy Bynum, R-Ketchikan, speaks Feb. 21, 2025, on the floor of the Alaska House of Representatives. (Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)A group of Alaska’s rural school districts are asking for help after the federal government failed to renew a program that sends grant money to logging-dependent areas.
On Monday, the Alaska Legislature joined the call for help by passing House Joint Resolution 5, which asks Congress to reauthorize the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000.
That act sent $12.6 million to Alaska schools in federal fiscal year 2023, but Congress has thus far failed to reauthorize the program.
The state Senate passed HJR 5 by a 19-1 vote on May 9 after modifying a version originally written by Rep. Jeremy Bynum, R-Ketchikan. The House agreed with the changes, 37-3, on Monday. 
The votes against the resolution came from conservative Republicans who generally oppose federal spending. 
The Secure Rural Schools Act, as it is commonly known, was designed to compensate rural school districts for tax revenue lost as the federal government began to restrict logging in the 1990s. 
In 2023, the law provided more than $250 million to districts nationwide, with about 5% of the funding coming to Alaska.
For some of Southeast Alaska’s rural school districts, the money was a big part of the local budget. Yakutat, for example, received more than $6,500 per student. Wrangell had almost $3,500, and the money was worth $584 for each of Ketchikan’s 2,045 students.
HJR 5, which will be sent to every member of Congress, asks for retroactive funding and for a permanent funding source to pay for the bill.
It also encourages Congress to open more federal land to timber cutting “in a manner that supports rural economic revitalization, conserves habitat, and promotes forest health.”

(Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)Maine Gov. Janet Mills has been selected for the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights award for suing the Trump administration after the U.S. Department of Agriculture unlawfully cut school nutrition funding to the state in retaliation for Maine’s protections for transgender people.
Mills will be honored at a ceremony in Washington, D.C. on June 5 alongside former Department of Justice Pardon Attorney Elizabeth Oyer and immigration reform activist Jeanette Vizguerra. According to the Thursday announcement, the recipients “were selected for their moral courage and willingness to act on their convictions — even at great personal risk.”
Oyer was fired from her role at the Department of Justice after she refused to carry out a request from the Deputy Attorney General’s Office to restore gun rights to actor Mel Gibson, a supporter of President Donald Trump who lost his rights due to a 2011 domestic violence conviction.
Vizguerra, a nationally known immigration rights activist, was detained on March 17 and is currently being held in an immigration detention facility in Aurora, Colorado, slated for deportation.
In a press statement announcing the award, Mills said, “Throughout my career as a district attorney, attorney general, and now as governor of Maine, I have fought to uphold the constitution of my state and my country. I feel it is the responsibility of all Americans to speak in defense of their principles, for the rights of others, and for the rule of law which protects us all.” 
“As a member of the generation of Americans who were inspired by the career of Robert F. Kennedy,” she continued, “I am truly humbled and grateful for this award, which recognizes how his remarkable legacy should inspire all of us today.”
Created in 1968 to carry on the legacy of Kennedy after his assassination, Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights advocates for human rights issues and pursues strategic litigation to hold governments accountable both in the U.S. and internationally. 
Kerry Kennedy, president of the organization, said in a statement that as the daughter of the former U.S. attorney general, she knows “firsthand the necessity of protecting and preserving our democracy.”
“From taking a stand against unlawful executive orders and bolstering the moral strength of the Department of Justice to advocating for vulnerable immigrants, these women have chosen to stand up for their beliefs during a time when it is increasingly difficult to do so,” she said. “I’m honored to recognize Governor Mills, Elizabeth Oyer, and Jeanette Vizguerra, and I hope that this award is a beacon of hope for others like them.”
On May 2, the State of Maine agreed to a settlement with the USDA after a federal court issued a temporary restraining order requiring the agency to unfreeze the funding. Under the agreement, the state dismissed its claims and the USDA said it will refrain from interfering with access to agency funding over alleged violations of Title IX without first following all legally required procedures. 
The U.S. Department of Justice is currently suing Maine over the state’s transgender athlete policy, which it claims violates the federal anti-discrimination law. 
The dispute dates back to Feb. 21 when Trump threatened to withhold federal funding unless Maine complies with his executive order banning transgender girls from playing girls’ sports. In response, Mills told the president, “We’re going to follow the law sir. We’ll see you in court.”
Kerry Kennedy’s brother, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., serves the Trump administration as secretary of Health and Human Services.

(Clark Corbin/Idaho Capital Sun)Yellowstone National Park officials trapped and killed an 11-year-old grizzly bear Tuesday after the bear continuously sought human food and overturned trash containers in busy areas of the park.
In a press release issued Wednesday, Yellowstone National Park officials said the 400-pound male grizzly bear posed a public safety threat in some of the busiest parts of the park. 
Park officials also sought to prevent other bears from becoming habituated to human food.

According to park officials, the bear learned how to flip over 800-pound trash containers, repeatedly accessed human food and disturbed trash bins near Old Faithful, the Midway Geyser Basin parking lot and the Nez Perce Picnic Area.

“It’s unfortunate that this bear began regularly seeking out garbage and was able to defeat the park’s bear-resistant infrastructure,” said Yellowstone Bear Management Biologist Kerry Gunther. “We go to great lengths to protect bears and prevent them from becoming conditioned to human food. But occasionally, a bear outsmarts us or overcomes our defenses. When that happens, we sometimes have to remove the bear from the population to protect visitors and property.”
It is the first grizzly bear killed through park management actions since 2017, when a different grizzly bear damaged tents and accessed human food near a backcountry campsite, Yellowstone officials said Wednesday.
Information about food storage and safety tips is available online at Yellowstone National Park’s website. Yellowstone rules prohibit the public from feeding wildlife, including bears, and require visitors to stay at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves.

Josh Shapiro and state lawmakers in Delaware County gathered outside the building to rally support for legislation they believe would help prevent other hospitals from closing across Pennsylvania in the future.
“We are here today because Crozer was a critically important health care system right here in Delaware County, a health care system that has been forced to close its doors and stop serving its patients because of the greed and mismanagement of a private equity firm,” Shapiro said Thursday.
Crozer-Chester Medical Center and Taylor Hospital are both owned by Prospect Medical Holdings, a California for-profit healthcare company. Both closed their doors in the past month, leaving the fifth most populous county in Pennsylvania with just two hospitals, as the private equity firm filed for bankruptcy.
“I am done letting private equity wreak havoc on our health care system, wreak havoc on our communities, treating our hospitals like a piggy bank that they can drain and then smash on the floor. Those days are over,” Shapiro said. “The time for action is right now. It is long past time to stand up for our local hospitals and nursing facilities and put in place real safeguards against private equity and for our community.”
Peggy Malone, who’s president of the Crozer-Chester Nurses Association, described what Prospect did as “immoral, devastating” but “legal,” due to current state laws. She noted previously closed Springfield Hospital and Delaware County Memorial Hospital over the past few years as additional examples from Prospect.
“I knew the health system before Prospect Medical came into our lives and created our nightmares. I can tell you, because I was here,” said Malone. “We let the wolf in the door here in Delaware County, and we can never, ever do that again. The wolf, an out of state private equity-funded company came in and ruthlessly, without hesitation, without shade, ate us all up.”
Dr. Max Cooper, who was an ER doctor at Crozer until its recent closing, said that one day after the hospital closed, a male victim was shot in the chest by a gun one block away. Since the hospital was closed, the man died during the 30-minute trip to Lankenau Medical Center in neighboring Montgomery County.
Shapiro and lawmakers in Delaware County’s delegation on hand for Thursday’s press conference say they believe House Bill 1460 and Senate Bill 322, dubbed the Health System Protection Act, would help prevent closures like Crozer from happening in the future.
The proposal would stop lease back arrangements, where private equity firms force hospitals to sell off the land the facilities are built on, to then rent back those spaces at what Shapiro called, “ridiculously high prices.”
The legislation would also empower the state Attorney General’s Office to review and, if necessary, block or place conditions on sales involving healthcare institutions to for-profit entities, like Prospect.
Attorney General Dave Sunday’s office told the Capital-Star that they are currently reviewing drafts of this legislation and “look forward to a robust negotiation process.”
“Attorney General Sunday is a staunch advocate for Pennsylvanians in every part of the Commonwealth to have access to affordable health care,” his office said in a statement. “This is a stance he will not relent from, and this office will be engaged in any and all matters in which we have authority to promote healthy communities.”
Sen. Tim Kearney (D-Delaware), who sponsored the measure, said this is the third legislative session that they have tried to address the issue. It passed the House in a previous session, but it did not make it through both legislative chambers. 
In recent months, he says he believes the tone of the conversation has recently changed.
“Both parties are now taking it more seriously than ever before,” Kearney said.
The proposal in the House is slated to receive a vote in the first week in June.
Rep. Lisa Borowski (D-Delaware), who sponsors House legislation calling for reforms, highlighted her personal connection to the recently-shuttered hospital. In addition to working in healthcare for 30 years and being the daughter of a physician and a nurse, she noted that she gave birth to her first son at Crozer Health.
As a result of the closure, Borowski pointed out that 2,651 people are now out of a job and hospitals, like Riddle Hospital, six miles away, are being overwhelmed with the excess of people who were previously being treated at the two former facilities owned by Prospect.
The state Department of Labor and Industry has been working to connect the workers who lost their jobs in the hospital with employment resources, holding a job fair at Subaru Park earlier this week. The state is also putting forward $1 million to ensure that EMS services remain available in the county following the closures of those hospitals.
The Capital-Star is seeking comment from Prospect. 
“I’m never going to let perfect be the enemy of possible,” Shapiro says
While similar legislation to help prevent hospital closures was introduced in previous sessions, there is a difference this time around. Unlike last year, the current bill does not include oversight of nonprofits hospitals by the attorney general’s office.
Kearney said he would prefer that both hospitals owned by private equity firms and non-profits were included. But, he recognized that the proposal didn’t get across the finish line in the previous session with that language and is hoping to get the bill to a point where enough lawmakers vote in support of the reforms.
“There are, as you can imagine, a lot of fairly powerful interests that are at work here, including the Hospital and Healthsystem Association of Pennsylvania (HAP), who opposed the bill last year,” Kearney said.
However, Kearney said they’ve been working “very hard to get to a point where we can get them to neutral,” on this proposal.
Shapiro also echoed a similar tone, noting that the General Assembly is divided between Democrats and Republicans. He would prefer to have a more broad version of the measure, but recognizes compromise may be needed.
“I want to have a strong bill, a bill that protects communities from the kind of profit seeking motives that we saw here in Delaware County, but I’m never going to let perfect be the enemy of possible,” Shapiro said.
Holding Prospect accountable?
Shapiro and other lawmakers talked at-length about wanting to hold Prospect “accountable” for closing multiple hospitals.
“We know who did this. Prospect did this, plain and simple, and they didn’t have to do this,” Shapiro said. “They stripped so much money out of this health system that they can no longer even make payroll to great nurses and doctors and medical staff and others who poured their heart and soul into this hospital.”
“But the thing is that money didn’t just vanish into thin air, that money that they sucked out of this institution is lining the pockets of those executives at Prospect,” he added. “Their ill-gotten gains deserve greater scrutiny.”
Over the last seven months, Shapiro said that the state put up than $15 million to try and keep the hospital open.
The Attorney General’s Office is fighting Prospect in bankruptcy court.
State Rep. Leanne Krueger (D-Delaware) asked them “to do everything they can, to claw back the money that we have invested into this system and to hopefully open a criminal investigation, so these guys are truly held accountable.”
When asked if he believes criminal charges should be filed against Prospect, Shapiro said that it’s a question for the attorney general’s office. A spokesman for Sunday did not respond to a question about a criminal investigation.
What about other hospitals owned by private equity?
Following the closing of Crozer, there are 13 hospitals in Pennsylvania that are still owned by private equity firms, according to the Private Equity Stakeholder Project (PESP).
“I’m concerned about the quality of care in those communities. I’m concerned about our rural hospitals, especially, that are teetering on the edge, those owned by private equity, and even some that aren’t particularly with the Medicaid cuts that are being contemplated in Washington,” Shapiro told reporters. “So, I’m very very worried about that.”
Shapiro said that legislation couldn’t go back and undo a transaction that legally took place, so the private equity firms would still own those hospitals, if those proposals were enacted into law. However, he said it remains to be seen whether or not the attorney general gets additional authority as part of this legislation to manage healthcare institutions that are currently owned by private equity.
“Open the ER now”
Shortly following the end of the press conference, a car attempted to pull into the hospital parking lot with what appeared to be a medical emergency involving a baby, who was seen by medical professionals on-site.
Peggy Malone, president of the Crozer-Chester Nurses Association, told reporters following that incident it was an example of why the hospital needs to remain open.
“Not one child should ever die because those bastards closed our hospital,” Malone said, visibly upset. “They never cared about the people in this community. But, we do, and this is why we’ve been fighting so hard and somebody has to open our ER now.”
Malone said since their hospital isn’t open, the baby would have to be treated at the closest hospital, about 30 minutes away.
“If that child had died today, the devastation that would have caused that entire family, it’s unbearable, and this can’t happen,” Malone said. “It has to stop now, get our ER open, now.”
“There’s no reason that that ER is closed. Get Prospect out of here. Hold them accountable, and open our ER now,” she said, which was followed by applause for others also standing by.
Malone said there are units and floors that could be opened to treat these emergencies and said Prospect is in the way of that happening.
“Get us in there. We will take care of this, but there are units in there that can be restored,” Malone said.
“You could keep us up and going. It might be smaller. It might not look like this, but get us open,” she added. “No baby should die.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_2955-768x1024.jpg,,,2025-05-15 21:01:58.099247

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)It’s unknown how many immigrants have been held for removal in South Dakota since President Donald Trump took office in January promising mass deportations, but public jail rosters in the state show more than two dozen being held now.
A U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesperson told South Dakota Searchlight that arrest statistics will be updated soon. The most recent figures on its website are from December.
A high-profile ICE operation Tuesday in Madison resulted in the arrests of eight people accused of being in the country without legal permission. Before that, ICE was already using jails in South Dakota as waystations for immigration actions more often since Trump took office, according to Minnehaha County Sheriff Mike Milstead.
“They’re not only doing what’s been reported on in Madison,” he said. “They’re doing investigations around the clock, with other federal agencies.”
22 at Sioux Falls jail
As of Thursday morning, there were 22 people detained at the Sioux Falls jail with pending immigration issues, according to Milstead, who said the figure can change by the hour as inmates come and go. 
About half of the current detainees with ICE holds came to the attention of immigration agents after being arrested on state-level criminal charges. The others arrived at the jail for removal actions alone, and Milstead said that activity has increased.
Eight targeted in Madison immigration operation appear in federal court

The jail holds federal inmates for both ICE and the U.S. Marshals Service, which oversees people accused of federal crimes, including those related to immigration. The feds pay the county $112 a day per federal inmate.
People targeted by ICE for removal who don’t have criminal charges can only be held at the jail in Sioux Falls for 72 hours before being transferred to an ICE detention facility, Milstead said.
Those facilities are themselves local jails, but Sioux Falls is not designated as a long-term detention facility for ICE.
Unlike inmates targeted for removal alone, inmates with ICE holds and criminal charges can stay in Sioux Falls until their case concludes. An inmate who comes in on an ICE hold and is later charged with a crime is transferred to the U.S. Marshals Service.
“If they’re Marshals prisoners, we’ve held them for years sometimes,” Milstead said.
Jails cooperate with ICE across South Dakota
Milstead’s jail has cooperated with ICE for more than a decade as part of the agency’s Secure Communities Program, under which participating local jails send booking fingerprints to both the FBI and ICE. The FBI uses the fingerprints to check for federal warrants and federal criminal charges. ICE checks for prior interactions with immigration agents.
The Minnehaha County Jail also sends the names of every foreign-born detainee to be cross-checked for legal status by ICE’s Criminal Alien Program.

The jail has agreed to step up its cooperation. Milstead recently signed a 287(g) agreement with ICE, which will require some of his deputies to take about eight hours of training, after which they’ll be able to serve ICE warrants for removal actions. There are several types of 287(g) agreements, all of which enable some measure of cross-deputization to allow local law enforcement to work on behalf of ICE.
Milstead and Hughes County Sheriff Patrick Callahan, in Pierre, both signed up for the warrant service program through 287(g) this spring. It won’t be a large change operationally in Sioux Falls, said Milstead, who expects to train around a dozen people.
Inmates brought to the jail by ICE on removal proceedings have already been served removal warrants by ICE agents. 
Those who come to jail on criminal charges and are later alleged to be in the country illegally are served removal warrants by ICE agents after those agents obtain warrants from a judge. The Minnehaha County Jail’s 287(g) agreement will allow trained deputies to serve those warrants, eliminating the need for an ICE agent to return to the jail for that purpose after asking for them.
Callahan told South Dakota Searchlight he’ll be the local officer trained to serve removal warrants. His jail has no inmates with immigration holds. 
Pennington County, South Dakota’s second-largest county by population, had four inmates with ICE holds as of Thursday afternoon, spokesperson Helene Duhamel said.

The bill responds to a federal court ruling in 2024 that found Washington in violation of a federal law concerning how long states must provide “free appropriate public education” to students.
Washington law now assures students with disabilities are eligible for special education services between the ages of 3 and 21. 
A federal law known as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, or IDEA, governs how states and public schools deliver special education and related services to children and youth with disabilities.
It does not require offering “free appropriate public education” to those aged 18 to 21. But, if a state offers free education programming for any adults, it needs to offer those services for students until they turn 22. 
In November 2024, a federal court issued an order against the state in the case of N.D. v. Reykdal, a class action lawsuit alleging that Washington’s law violates the IDEA. Washington allowed students up to 21 years old to enroll in its adult education programs and waived the tuition fee for those who could not pay. Making the programs free triggered a requirement to comply with the federal law.
Superintendent of Public Instruction Chris Reykdal requested this year’s bill to align state requirements with the federal statute. It passed unanimously in the Senate and 93-1 in the House. It will take effect July 27, in time for the next school year.
“Ensuring students have access to a free and appropriate public education through their 22nd birthday is a vital step toward equity and opportunity,” Reykdal said in an email this week.
When the law takes effect, it will continue providing education-related services to students with disabilities until the end of the school year in which they turn 22. These include free admission to the State School for the Blind and the Center for Deaf and Hard of Hearing Youth, and attendance in education programs at residential schools.
OSPI estimated 300 to 1,200 students could benefit and said costs could range from $6.8 million to $27 million per school year to serve them.
Sen. Adrian Cortes, D-Battle Ground, the bill’s sponsor and a special education teacher at Camas High School in southwest Washington, said he has two students who could eventually benefit if they choose to enroll in a transition program for young adults. 
“It is not a big population but it is a population that will now be served,” he said.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/unnamed-2-4-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-15 20:04:13.112454

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)SIOUX FALLS — The eight men targeted in an immigration enforcement operation at two Madison businesses this week are accused of using fraudulent documents to get their jobs and had been under investigation for months.
The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement inquiries that ultimately led to their detention and criminal charges began in February, according to documents filed in the U.S. District Court of South Dakota.
One of the men is accused of fraudulently misusing visas, permits and other documents. The other seven are each accused of one count of fraudulent use of identification documents. Each of the charges carry up to $250,000 in fines and up to five years in prison. 
All but one of the men were arrested at one of the two businesses in Madison that employed them, Global Polymer Industries and Manitou Equipment America.
Men arrested in Madison among dozens of immigrants detained in South Dakota

Manitou received a $1 million tax break from the Governor’s Office of Economic Development for an expansion in December of 2022. At that point, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was governor of South Dakota. Manitou’s owner told South Dakota Searchlight during a 2023 tour that the business employed 250 people.
Noem was given an honorary doctorate and delivered a commencement speech to graduates at Dakota State University in Madison just days before the arrests. Approximately 200 people protested outside that event.
The details of each case vary slightly, but affidavits — sworn written statements — from two ICE agents allege the men used fraudulent identification documents and were working under names that weren’t their own. The agents reviewed I-9 documents, which are used by employers to verify a person’s eligibility to work in the U.S., and allegedly learned in February and March that the names on the documents were fraudulent. 
Five of the men had signed the allegedly fraudulent I-9s in 2022, suggesting they’d worked under their adopted names for years. Two others signed I-9s in 2023, and one signed his in 2024.
U.S. Magistrate Judge Veronica Duffy signed the search warrants Friday that authorized the operation resulting in the arrests.
One of the men was at home, according to court documents. The rest were at work. In six of the affidavits, ICE agents allege the men admitted they’d been working under false names.
Five are from Nicaragua, two are from Guatemala, and one is from El Salvador, according to ICE.
On Thursday in Sioux Falls, Judge Duffy ordered that the men be held by the U.S. Marshals Service at least until a preliminary hearing can be held. That hearing, which will take place within the next 14 days, would offer the men an opportunity to challenge their charges, and to make arguments for pre-trial release.

(Chris Dorst | Charleston Gazette-Mail)The Kanawha-Charleston Board of Health voted down an amendment to its clean indoor air regulations on Thursday that would have permitted casinos in the county to allow indoor cigarette smoking in 10% of the square footage of their establishment.
The amendment was proposed by board member Jessica Hudson. It would have only applied only to gambling establishments, where 10% of the square footage would have been exempt to the clean air regulations. Any business that allowed indoor smoking, according to the amendment, would have needed to install a special ventilation system and would have been barred from serving food in the area with smoking.
Board members voted 4-2 against the amendment.
Mardi Gras Casino and Resort, in Cross Lanes, West Virginia, proposed the exemption for the clean indoor air regulations to the county board of health in October 2024. In its presentation to the health board, representatives for Mardi Gras said they were losing business to a new casino in Ashland, Kentucky — about an hour’s drive away from Mardi Gras — where smoking was allowed in some areas.










... this is not a chamber of commerce. We're here for health.


– Dr. Dara Aliff-Lao


“Reading the financial impact certainly was impactful to me in terms of how it affects the community. But that said, this is not a chamber of commerce. We’re here for health,” said Dr. Dara Aliff-Lao, an OBGYN by trade, who voted against the amendment. “I just feel like it would send the wrong message for a health department to rescind anything. I feel like once we start eroding things, they go away completely. We’ve seen that time and time again in other aspects of health.” 
Hudson and Board President Jeremy Nelson were the only two board members to vote in support of loosening the county’s indoor smoking regulations. Joining Aliff-Lao against the amendment were nurses Lillian Morris and Danita Nellhaus and Dr. Art Rubin.
Hudson, who works as the executive director of Business Strategy & Analytics at Vandalia Health Network, declined an interview following the board’s vote on Thursday.
Nelson, an executive at Moses Auto Group by trade, called into the meeting virtually Thursday and as such was not available for an interview.
During the meeting, Nelson said that he believed a “carveout” was needed in the county’s clean indoor air regulations to help Mardi Gras stay competitive against Sandy’s Racing & Gaming in Ashland.
“I think this is certainly a carveout and I think that this organization [Mardi Gras] has a huge, huge impact, on our community,” Nelson said. “They are at a disadvantage and I think they’ve proven that the amount of people’s money that’s going across the state line to Ashland [in Kentucky] right now is alarming.”
But Aliff-Lao and Nellhaus told the press following the meeting that the health risks aren’t worth it. 
Employees, Nellhaus said, would be constantly exposed to second- and third-hand smoke. This could put people who are unaware they were pregnant as well as those with certain medical conditions especially at risk.
“Mardi Gras did a good job as far as their presentation, but I think I have to say — no matter what they’ve said — I just understand the implications,” Nellhaus said. “I mean, I’m a health care professional. I just think that totally outweighs anything that they would offer.”
Aliff-Lao pointed out that smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the nation. 
In West Virginia, nearly a quarter of residents — the highest rate in the nation, per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — report using tobacco products. Lung cancer diagnosis rates here outpace that of every other state. After heart disease — which is also exacerbated by smoking — cancer is the leading cause of death in West Virginia, and lung cancer deaths occur more frequently than any other cancer related death. 
The vote Thursday followed a 30-day public comment period, where members of the public were urged to voice their opinion on opening up the county’s clean air regulations. 
Lalena Price, public information officer for KCHD, provided a copy of those comments to West Virginia Watch upon request. Out of 36 comments received, only five seemed to support allowing smoking in the county’s casinos. Comments against the amendment came from casino patrons, the American Heart Association, former smokers and more.
Aliff-Lao and Nellhaus both said they were sympathetic to Mardi Gras’ economic concerns. The presentation shared with the board in October alleged that the casino’s market share was down to 32.8% in 2024 versus the 41.2% it held at the end of 2023. 
“Mardi Gras Casino will continue to see a steady decline unless change is made to stop the erosion,” the presentation read.
But Aliff-Lao said there are other economic factors that the casino should consider, namely the continuous decline in the region’s population.
“We recognize that there can be an economic impact, and you hope that the casino will rally around and find other ways to make up for that revenue,” Aliff-Lao said. “But I think [protecting] the safety of the patrons and the employees who really would be exposed [to cigarette smoke] is our job as the board of health.”

Arkansas as a whole has the 10th highest share of women of childbearing age covered by Medicaid in rural areas, according to a Georgetown University Center for Children and Families study presented during a webinar Thursday. 
The report also highlighted 20 U.S. counties where approximately half of their women of childbearing age are covered by Medicaid. One of those counties is in Arkansas, according to the study. Eastern Arkansas’ Lee County has about 8,100 residents and a nearly 39% poverty rate, according to the U.S. Census.
Medicaid is a significant source of health coverage for women of childbearing age, especially for those living in small towns and rural communities, the report found. The study defines these communities as non-metropolitan counties with urban areas of fewer than 50,000 residents.
Bills to improve Arkansas maternal health, change ballot initiative process head to Sanders’ desk

“It’s absolutely critical for maternal and infant health that women have access to affordable, comprehensive healthcare before, during and after they get pregnant,” said Joan Alker, Georgetown University Center for Children and Families director and lead author of the report.
Women in rural areas face greater challenges to accessing care because of a shortage of providers, hospital closures and the loss of labor and delivery units and obstetrical capacity, Alker said. 
Nationally, 23.3% of women of childbearing age (19 to 44 years old) in rural areas are covered by Medicaid, compared to 20.5% of women in metropolitan areas, according to the report. Louisiana and New Mexico have the highest share of Medicaid-covered women, with just over 40% each. Nearly 28% of women of childbearing age are covered by Medicaid in rural Arkansas.
For many Arkansas women, especially those living in rural areas with low-income families, Medicaid may be the only health insurance source to keep them healthy throughout pregnancy, Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families Health Policy Director Camille Richoux said in an interview.
“For me, it’s a great thing that we have Medicaid ensuring that women throughout the state have coverage options,” Richoux said. “It also means that we have more at stake whenever there are threats to Medicaid…this report really makes that case of how any kind of threats or cuts around Medicaid could have the potential to be devastating to a lot of women in the state and especially in a state that has so many challenges in maternal health.”
Arkansas has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the nation and the third-highest infant mortality rate, according to the Arkansas Center for Health Improvement.


Let us know what you think...


 

Access to Medicaid could change under proposed federal legislation. A U.S. House panel approved a plan Wednesday that would reduce federal spending on Medicaid by $625 billion over the next decade. 
The proposal includes a provision for work requirements. Arkansas implemented a work-reporting requirement in 2018 that led to 18,000 people losing coverage, in part because enrollees were unaware or confused about how to report they were working. A federal judge later ruled the program was illegal. Arkansas officials submitted a request for a new work requirement earlier this year.
‘The first time didn’t work’: Georgia and Arkansas scale back Medicaid work requirements

Rural communities have a lot at stake with the congressional Medicaid debate, Alker said, because the loss of Medicaid revenue would place “additional pressure on a very strained system.” Nearly half of all births in rural areas are covered by Medicaid, and less access to obstetrical care leads to worse outcomes to moms and their babies, she said.
According to one study, 293 rural hospitals stopped providing obstetric care between 2011 and 2023. Another study found that more than 52% of rural hospitals did not provide obstetric care by 2022. 
Arkansas ranks sixth in terms of states with the highest percentage of maternity care deserts, according to the March of Dimes, which defines maternity care deserts as areas with no birthing facility or obstetric clinician. Nearly 51% of Arkansas is a maternity care desert, according to the organization’s 2024 report.
“If we see more hospital closures and loss of labor and delivery units, all women living in rural areas are at risk of losing out on the care they need, regardless of who is their insurer, if that care is just not available,” Alker said. “So these communities will not be able to grow and thrive without a robust system to support women and families.” 
Beyond reducing healthcare access for all rural community residents, not just those insured through Medicaid, Richoux noted hospital closures can hurt an entire community, especially when it’s the area’s largest employer. 
“Not everybody can just leave…to move out of an area is an easy thing to say, a lot harder to do,” she said. “And people shouldn’t have to be forced to leave their small, rural town because their hospital is unnecessarily closed.”

Attorneys for Maria “Maer” Malinowski, including former U.S. attorney and Little Rock lawyer Bud Cummins, filed the lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas on her behalf and as the personal representative of her late husband, Bryan Malinowski. 
The complaint, which names ATF and 10 agents and task force officers as defendants, alleges agents chose “the most aggressive tactics available” to serve a search warrant before dawn on March 19, 2024, “even though no facts or circumstances justified the use of such tactics,” according to a press release. 
“Throughout my government service, I worked with many highly motivated and talented agents from various agencies who conducted thorough investigations while respecting the rights of every citizen,” Cummins said in a statement. “The facts speak for themselves: the plan was unnecessary, and the execution was illegal. If the government cannot be held accountable in this case, none of us can feel safe in our homes.” 

05.15.2025 MALINOWSKI V ATF 
In addition to being the executive director of the Bill and Hillary Clinton National Airport, Bryan Malinowski was also a firearms hobbyist. According to the complaint, the ATF issued a federal search warrant based on the suspicion that he was acting as a firearms dealer without securing a $200 firearms license.  
ATF regulations at that time provided safe harbor for collectors who sold firearms without it being their primary livelihood. Because Bryan Malinowski did not rely on selling firearms at gun shows as his primary source of income, “he considered himself safely within the law’s allowance,” according to the lawsuit. 
After knocking on the Malinowskis’ door around 6 a.m. on March 19, 2024, federal agents broke down the door with a battering ram. “An exchange of gunfire” resulted in Bryan Malinowski being shot in the head, according to the complaint. He died two days later at the age of 53. 
Following Malinowski’s death, federal and state lawmakers sought more answers about the incident.
The lawsuit seeks both compensatory and punitive damages for Maer Malinowski’s “mental anguish, emotional pain, torment and suffering caused by her personal experience of the wrongful conduct and detention by Defendants.” 
“Today’s lawsuit seeks justice for the nightmare I’ve been living for the last 14 months,” Maer Malinowski said in a statement. “Bryan believed the men who broke into our home were intruders, and he took a bullet to the forehead and ultimately gave his life defending me and our home from people he thought were trying to harm us. While nothing can bring back my husband of 25 years, today’s filing seeks to hold the federal government accountable for what they violently and wrongfully took from me on March 19, 2024.”
Her lawsuit alleges 13 violations by the ATF and its agents, including four federal constitutional claims — Failure to Knock and Announce, Unlawful Entry, Use of Deadly Force and Illegal Detention. The other allegations are based on Arkansas state tort claims, including Wrongful Death, Assault and Battery, Negligence and False Imprisonment of herself, and for Manslaughter and Negligent Homicide, Battery, Aggravated Assault and Criminal Mischief. 
The false imprisonment allegation stems from the hours she spent handcuffed and wearing only a nightgown in the back of a police car while ATF agents searched her home, according to the lawsuit.

,DC,2025-05-15 23:18:30+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Is Congress trampling on state laws protecting property rights against pipelines?,Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/congress-trampling-state-laws-protecting-property-rights-against-pipelines,,"Lawmakers and advocates on the right and left are raising questions about a provision in legislation a powerful U.S. House committee approved Wednesday, with critics arguing it would allow federal regulators to approve natural gas and carbon dioxide pipelines over prohibitions in state law.Two sections in the House Energy and Commerce Committee’s reconciliation instructions, which the Republican-led panel passed along party lines, would allow pipeline operators to pay $10 million to participate in an expedited federal permitting process that critics say would override state laws.The potentially intensely controversial provision would give the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission exclusive authority to issue licenses for pipelines carrying natural gas, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, oil, or other energy products and byproducts.“Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if the Commission issues a license under subsection (c)(1) of this section and the licensee is in compliance with such license, no requirement of State or local law that requires approval of the location of the covered pipeline with respect to which the license is issued may be enforced against the licensee,” the text of the bill reads.A summary document provided by the committee says the bill would apply to states only in cases when state agencies are responsible for conducting federal reviews.“For States, this includes their authorities to impose conditions for any certifying authorities delegated to States by federal law,” the document says.But a variety of groups and lawmakers — environmental groups opposed to loosening reviews, landholder advocates concerned about property rights and small-government conservatives who favor local control — say the measure would open the door for the federal government to nullify state and local protections.That includes a recent South Dakota law to prevent pipeline operators from using eminent domain to force landowners to sell or allow use of their property.“This is federal overreach,” South Dakota state Rep. Karla Lems said in a Thursday interview. “It would override any state or local law regarding … the routing of a pipeline.”Trump’s ‘big, beautiful bill’The Energy and Commerce Committee was one of 11 House panels that have approved reconciliation instructions and sent them to the House Budget Committee to consolidate into one package. House Republicans plan to consider the 1,100-page package on the floor next week.The complex process, known as budget reconciliation, allows the majority party to pass legislation with simple majorities in both chambers, avoiding the U.S. Senate’s usual 60-vote requirement.President Donald Trump has described the package as “one big, beautiful bill” and it contains a host of his domestic policy priorities including extending tax cuts and increasing funding for immigration enforcement.A provision in Democrats’ 2022 reconciliation bill encouraged an existing trend of pipeline installation in the Midwest. The measure provided tax breaks for carbon sequestration, which can involve piping the carbon dioxide byproducts that result from processes like ethanol production into underground storage chambers.Actually building those pipelines across hundreds of miles between ethanol producers, particularly in farm states like Iowa and South Dakota, and underground storage facilities in North Dakota, where the geology supports it, requires the use of private land, which has been strongly opposed for several reasons and led to state restrictions.Environmental and safety groups worry some pipeline at some point will rupture and therefore pose a danger to nearby residents and water sources.Private property owners and conservative political allies say they should have stronger rights to resist pipeline operators from using their property.Plea to CongressThat unusual coalition was apparent again this week as environmentalists and conservatives united to oppose the measure in the Energy and Commerce bill.A collection of 70 environmental and conservation groups signed a letter to the committee Wednesday urging the language be removed.“These measures would radically expand federal jurisdiction over all types of interstate pipelines, drastically limit public input, shorten environmental review timelines, and shield projects from legal challenges, all while clearing the way for expanded use of federal eminent domain against landowners,” the letter said.The letter was signed by groups ranging from the local agriculture and conservation organization Dakota Rural Action to national environmental group Food & Water Watch.South Dakota House Speaker Jon Hansen, a self-described MAGA Republican, tweeted screenshots of the provision with the message “property rights are under attack again.”Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican former U.S. House member and rival to Trump in the 2024 presidential nomination race, reposted the tweet.“This represents overriding both the rights of states and private property owners to serve Biden’s Green New Deal,” DeSantis wrote above Hansen’s message. “What the heck is going on up there?”Uncertainty over impactChase Jensen, a senior organizer with Dakota Rural Action, said in a press release accompanying the coalition letter that the group was calling on members of Congress “to stand with the State of South Dakota and oppose this clear attempt to buy permits and bypass the people.”“When South Dakota was first faced with carbon dioxide pipelines, our congressmen said it was up to the state to deal with it,” Jensen said. “Now that we have barred eminent domain for these private projects – their billionaire owners are trying to cut the state out of the process altogether.”South Dakota’s U.S. House member, Republican Dusty Johnson, said in a statement to South Dakota Searchlight he’d been unaware of the bill’s language but predicted it would be removed before final passage.He indicated he was unsure what the effect of the bill would be, but started “from a place of deep skepticism.”""I wasn't aware of this language until committee text was released,” Johnson, who does not sit on Energy and Commerce, wrote. “As a former public utilities commissioner, I have strong concerns with bypassing state permitting and I begin from a place of deep skepticism for this language. I doubt it will be included in President Trump's 'one, big, beautiful bill.'”But U.S. Rep. Julie Fedorchak, a North Dakota Republican who is a former state utility regulator, told reporters on a press call Thursday morning that she thought the bill would not block the state from being involved in environmental reviews, even if a company seeks a pipeline permit from federal regulators.Fedorchak said she doesn't think the proposal would limit local input on projects, adding that FERC has a “pretty robust permitting process” for interstate natural gas pipelines.A spokesman for the Energy and Commerce Committee did not return a message seeking clarification Thursday.North Dakota Monitor Editor Amy Dalrymple and South Dakota Searchlight Editor Seth Tupper contributed to this report.",,,,2025-05-15 20:04:13.112454

Former Wyoming Public Broadcasting Service manager, now chair of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, defends NPR and public television against Trump’s attacks.
The post Wyoming’s Calvert, national broadcast chair, says NPR needs more perspectives appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming’s Ruby Calvert, chair of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, challenged President Donald Trump’s characterization of federally funded public media as “trash,” “madness,” “biased,” “radical” and “woke propaganda disguised as news.”
Calvert, a 35-plus-year veteran of Wyoming Public Broadcasting Service in Riverton, leads the independent national corporation that distributes money to National Public Radio, the Public Broadcasting Service and, mostly, to about 1,500 independent broadcasters around the country.
The CPB sued Trump and others on April 28, the day his administration tried to fire three of Calvert’s fellow national board members. Two days after that, Trump ordered federal agencies to stop direct or indirect payments to NPR and PBS, jeopardizing public radio and television programming across the country and the national emergency alert system.
“I think they need to be more careful and include more perspectives when they write these stories.” Ruby Calvert
The White House said Trump was finally ending “the madness of NPR and PBS.” The president said the fund-freezing order will “ensure that Federal funding does not support biased and partisan news coverage.”
The White House characterized NPR and PBS broadcasting as “trash” and said “NPR and PBS have zero tolerance for non-leftist viewpoints.”
Calvert agrees some people believe some public broadcasts are biased, but rejected Trump’s broad-brush tarring of the news, educational and cultural programs. Asked in an interview with WyoFile whether NPR and PBS are biased and spread woke propaganda as alleged, she responded, “No.”
Need for different perspectives
Calvert said she believes NPR needs to work to rebut allegations of bias and correct any tilt in its reports. In news reporting, “there are bound to be issues of bias somewhere or other,” she said.
“I think they [NPR] need to be more careful and include more perspectives when they write these stories,” she said. “I’m not throwing NPR, you know, into the fire here.
“I think everybody has a different perspective, depending on your own prejudices,” she said. “Everything is different for everybody.”
NPR faces a particular challenge because it produces many more news stories than PBS, Calvert said. By definition, those news stories often are fast-breaking and touch on controversial topics in a sharply divided country.
Criticism of national public television news, however, is unwarranted, she said.
“I think the accusations against PBS are really not fair.”
Calvert’s perspective is unique, coming from a broadcast veteran from a deep red state.
“Those of you who know me personally know that I come from a deeply conservative Republican family and state,” she told fellow board members at a May 2 meeting. “My brother [Eli Bebout] was both speaker of the House and president of the Senate in the Wyoming Legislature, where we continue to hold a large Republican majority.
“Like him, I am very fiscally conservative and philosophically conservative,” she said, “and I want to note that there are many conservative friends who support public media.”
She said she has spoken with U.S. Sen. John Barrasso about CPB funding in the recission package, in which the administration seeks to claw back allocated but unspent funds, and in the upcoming budget reconciliation negotiations where future funding is at stake.
“We don’t really know what’s in either one of those,” Calvert said. But she’s heard the corporation, NPR and PBS are clearly targets to the point that Congress “would basically eliminate our funding for 2026 [and] 2027.”
The CPB has requested $535 million each year, she said.
Barrasso “has been supportive in the past,” she said. “I think he understands the value of public television and public radio in Wyoming.”
The Wyoming delegation is in a tight spot, Calvert said.
“They’re trying to reduce the federal deficit, and they’ve got DOGE going on, and it’s a difficult situation,” she said.
Barrasso did not respond to a request for comment on the president’s attempt to fire CPB board members or his executive order regarding a freeze on funding.
The Calvert solution
Calvert has a solution far short of ending federal funding, public broadcasting and the emergency alert system that relies on NPR infrastructure known as the Public Radio Satellite System.
“I just hope that local stations, if they’re perceiving a large amount of bias with NPR, they need to be talking with NPR,” she said. “And, I would say, threatening them to say ‘we’re not going to continue to support you if this continues.’
“It’s got to be up to the local stations putting the pressure on [NPR] to look at their newsroom a little differently.”
“The executive branch is not supposed to be controlling the CPB.”Judge Randolph Moss
Calvert spoke to WyoFile the day after a court hearing in Washington, D.C. at which a CPB attorney and one from the Department of Justice argued whether Trump could fire the three members of the independent corporation. Congress set up the CPB as a firewall to prevent the political meddling that Trump is practicing, broadcasters argue.
Trump claims that because he has the authority to appoint members of the board, he has the implicit authority to fire them. The judge hearing the case has prevented the president from appointing temporary replacements, a move CPB attorney said would have opened the door to a DOGE invasion and the corporation’s dismantling.
Among other things, U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss said Wednesday that if Trump can fire the directors, he is, in effect, controlling the independent corporation contrary to law.
“There are cases that say the power to remove entails the power to control,” Moss said. “And the statute is pretty clear that the executive branch is not supposed to be controlling the CPB.”
To protect its independence, the CPB board on Thursday amended its bylaws to prohibit the president from removing any director, an option discussed in the hearing before Judge Moss.

The official is not identified in SLED’s four-sentence release or the attached arrest warrant. Portions of the warrant are redacted as per the agency’s policy not to identify victims, according to a spokeswoman.
But the 1st District congresswoman confirmed on multiple social media posts that she was the target.
According to SLED, Cain posted the threat April 26 on X, formerly Twitter. Four days later, Cain “admitted to authoring and posting the threat” to federal agents.
“I’m going to assassinate (redacted) with a gun and I’m being 100% dead a–” the post read on the arrest warrant. While that post has been deleted from X, a repost of it shows the threat in all caps with “Representative Nancy Mace” in the part that SLED blacked out.
Mace thanked Capitol Police and SLED on social media for arresting Cain, who she called a “trans activist.”
While the arrest warrant says Cain is a white male, Cain has identified on social media as a transgender girl who goes by the pronouns she/her.
Cain remained Thursday evening at the Greenville County jail. A bond hearing is scheduled for 9:30 a.m. Friday.
Cain faces a maximum penalty of a $5,000 fine and five years in prison.
The SC Daily Gazette was unable to determine if Cain has an attorney.
Mace, who is mulling a bid for governor next year, has repeatedly and intentionally offended transgender people in recent months.
Cain’s post came five days after Mace’s contentious exchange with a transgender student following a speech at the University of South Carolina. After the 20-year-old student asked Mace to apologize for using the word “tranny,” Mace asked her if the word was derogatory, then repeated it three times and posted a clip of the exchange on X.
“The radical tr*ns movement is no longer just about pronouns,” Mace wrote in one of her multiple posts about Cain’s arrest. “It’s about silencing anyone who dares to speak the truth. With threats. With violence. With hate.”
According to Mace, it wasn’t the first threat on her life this year.
Last month, Mace told Republicans at the Greenville County GOP convention that she was among the targets of a Pennsylvania man charged with threatening to kill President Donald Trump and other officials.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Nancy-Mace-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-15 19:04:54.570601

(Photo by Leah Romero / Source NM)A federal judge this week dismissed novel criminal charges brought by the U.S. government against more than 100 migrants who crossed into a newly created military buffer zone along New Mexico’s border with Mexico.
On April 15, the U.S. Department of Interior transferred 406 square miles of land to the U.S. Army. Three days later, the Army made the land an extension of the Fort Huachuca Army installation in Arizona. That same day, the fort’s commander issued a security regulation designating the land as a restricted area.
Then in the last week of April, prosecutors with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Mexico started charging people with trespassing on the land, now called the New Mexico National Defense Area.
After hearing arguments from U.S. Attorney Ryan Ellison and federal public defenders last week, U.S. Chief Magistrate Judge Gregory Wormuth on Wednesday dismissed the trespass charges against 98 migrants, according to court records. He ruled that the migrants couldn’t have known that they were entering a military zone when they crossed the U.S.-Mexico border.
Amanda Skinner, the federal public defender who argued with the U.S. government over the charges, said Thursday that Judge Wormuth dismissed the same counts against an additional 22 migrants who were likely arrested on Wednesday and Tuesday.
Prosecutors have charged at least 339 people under the military trespass laws, according to news releases from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for New Mexico.
“We acknowledge and respect the judge’s authority to determine probable cause,” Skinner, the federal public defender, told Source NM in a statement. “This was the right result under the law.”
A spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney’s Office for New Mexico did not respond to an email seeking comment on the dismissals.
Ellison argued that migrants should have known they weren’t allowed to cross into the land because of nearly 200 signs the government has installed along the border, and noted that more signs are being installed.
That argument failed to convince Wormuth, who ruled there is no reason to believe any of the migrants could have, or did, see the signs.
“Beyond the reference to signage, the United States provides no facts from which one could reasonably conclude that the Defendant knew he was entering the NMNDA,” Wormuth wrote.
The government’s factual allegations against the migrants are “virtually identical” when it comes to the military trespass charges across hundreds of cases, Wormuth wrote. Prosecutors have taken a “cut-and-paste approach” in their criminal complaints, he wrote, which allows him to apply the same legal analysis “across every criminal complaint charging these crimes filed thus far and still pending.”
The migrants still face charges of entering the U.S. without inspection, which could mean they will face deportation. Wormuth dismissed the charges without prejudice, meaning prosecutors can refile them.
It remained unclear on Thursday where the migrants are being held as they await their hearings. On Thursday, an immigration attorney said all three of the immigration detention centers in New Mexico are full during a news conference with U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez (D-N.M.) announcing new legislation that would require more accountability for immigration detention officials.
A spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney’s Office told Source NM on Wednesday that the U.S. Marshals Service decides where defendants are detained. A spokesperson for the Marshals Service, when reached by phone for comment, asked Source NM to submit questions in writing, and then did not respond to an emailed list of questions.
A spokesperson for the Department of Defense told Source NM the New Mexico National Defense Area itself does not contain confinement areas.

The public is invited to the 6 p.m. meeting at the Venue at Highlander Accelerator, 2120 N. 30th St. Representatives of the port authority will introduce the planning process and gather input to shape a vision for “inclusive economic development in the area.”
The proposed Innovation District is separate from the planned airport area business park project that is also being steered by the port authority board, in partnership with a development team led by Omaha Economic Development Corp. and Burlington Capital.
Funds for both projects originally were approved by the Nebraska Legislature as part of the Nebraska Economic Recovery Act of 2022, though the legislation and funding sources have since been updated.
On the Innovation District initiative, the port authority board has started to lay groundwork in awarding a $546,000 consulting contract to HR&A Advisors Inc. Focus group sessions are to be held the day before the public meeting.
HR&A secured the contract in April after a competitive bidding process. In conjunction with Lamp Rynearson and Vireo, the contractor over a six-month period is to create a vision and business plan model for a local Innovation District, which is to be developed within the boundaries of the Inland Port Authority. The consultant is to outline project costs and identify key indicators to measure success.
Such a district is envisioned as an urban hotbed of leading-edge institutions, business and entrepreneurs. 
On the business park venture, a concern voiced by a few state lawmakers and community members was that it lacked community input early on. The business park initiative is funded partly through a separate $90 million state earmark.
Both the business park and the Innovation District are seen as anchors within the boundaries of the port authority and seen as key to helping private businesses produce jobs and economic development that benefits North Omaha area residents. The port authority jurisdiction, members say, is roughly 3,000 acres, although not all of that is buildable property.

This session, we don't have that luxury,” Gov. Joe Lombardo said while discussing health care proposals at UNLV Thursday. (Photo: Dana Gentry/Nevada Current)Gov. Joe Lombardo is predicting success for his Nevada Health Care Access Act, which was introduced at the Legislature on Thursday. The measure is designed to increase Nevada’s health care workforce, reduce disparities in care for rural residents, and cut red tape. 
“I have an agreement and cooperation with (legislative) leadership,” Lombardo said Thursday at an event where he introduced the measure to medical students and others at UNLV’s Kirk Kerkorian Medical School in Las Vegas. “We anticipate success here.”
‘Not personal’
Lombardo has expressed frustration with legislative delays in bringing his bills forth for hearings. The governor said that frustration has not been alleviated but added he’s not taking it personally. 
“I’m confident we still have enough time. And, you know, sometimes you think it’s personal as the governor and whether it’s a partisan issue. It’s not the case. The legislative session is very cumbersome short term, and you continually want to remove the need for a special session,” he said.  “What we experienced in this session is unique, because we’ve had a lot of federal funding in previous years and a lot of ability to act on funds that are available. This session, we don’t have that luxury.”
President Donald Trump, Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, and the Republican-controlled Congress have proposed or executed cuts at a hectic pace since Trump took office in January. 
“We’re having grants cut weekly,” UNLV Interim President Chris Heavey told the Current. 
The governor said his legislative priorities remain constant – health care, education and housing – but noted the timing of the Economic Forum’s reduced budget forecasts late in the session “makes it difficult to make decisions, especially in your budgetary hearings.”
“It seems like it’s personal, but it’s not,” Lombardo reiterated of legislative delays in bringing his bills forward for hearings, adding he wanted to “dispel the rumor out there that I’m not communicating with leadership. I have constant communication with leadership.”
System failures
The state’s health care “weaknesses have gone unaddressed for many years,”  Stacie Weeks, an administrator of Nevada’s Department of Health and Human Services, told the gathering. “They have exacerbated the state’s health care workforce challenges and stymied our efforts at the state to contain costs and improve quality in our system.”
Weeks noted Nevada ranks “in the bottom in just about every health score nationally. We must do better.” 
Increasing the state’s healthcare workforce is among the bill’s priorities.
“As our state’s Medicaid director, I’ve seen first hand that improving access to coverage does help with healthier communities,” Weeks said. “However, what good is health insurance or coverage, even in Medicaid, if someone can’t get to see a doctor when they need to, unless they are in an emergency?”
Weeks say the current system leads to higher costs and poor outcomes. 
Lombardo’s bill seeks to increase the state’s health care workforce by establishing a $25 million annual fund to address workforce shortages, particularly in underserved communities and high-demand specialties, by “driving innovation through public-private partnerships, competitive grants,” and targeting infrastructure investments, says a handout from the governor’s office. The fund will be managed by the newly-created Nevada Health Authority, which will be led by Weeks. 
Of the medical school’s 60 graduates this semester, 42% are remaining in Nevada for residency programs. 
“If you don’t have the residency programs here in the state of Nevada, where are these graduates going to end up?” Lombardo asked rhetorically, noting physicians tend to remain in the state where they complete their residency.  
The legislation would also reform the process of obtaining prior authorizations from health insurers in an effort to speed up treatment and get bills paid faster, Weeks said. 
All health care plans will be required to use a standardized electronic process for prior authorization. No prior authorization will be required for emergencies, and insurance companies will be required to respond within two business days. 
The legislation calls for graduate medical education programs that would incentivize training in high-demand specialties. The legislation would provide liability protections for clinical staff to encourage greater participation. 
The bill intends to streamline and accelerate the state’s licensing and credentialing process, the governor said. The state is currently 48th in the nation for practicing doctors per capita, according to Weeks. 
The bill also seeks to increase access to dental care by expanding training programs for dental hygienists and assistants, especially in underserved areas. 
Under the legislation, Nevada’s Patient Protection Commission would be called on to conduct a feasibility study for an academic medical center to further increase the healthcare workforce. 
A newly-created Office of Mental Health would be housed under the Nevada Health Authority, with the goal of expanding access to mental health care statewide while addressing workforce shortages.
Finally, the legislation would simplify and speed up the eligibility process for Medicaid applicants.
The outlook for Medicaid funding for Nevada in the wake of the Trump administration’s budget proposals “does not look as damaging to the state of Nevada” as anticipated, said Weeks, noting the department is examining how work requirements will affect the program. “But overall, it’s not as big in terms of cuts that we expected for the state.”

The court advised plaintiffs against filing an amended complaint “simply as a vehicle through which to publicize allegations” about their transgender sorority sister. 
The post Judge keeps transgender woman in Wyoming sorority case, but warns lawyers against irrelevant allegations appeared first on WyoFile .","A federal judge denied a transgender woman’s request to be dismissed from a highly publicized lawsuit against her and a University of Wyoming sorority, but gave a warning Wednesday to opposing counsel in the case — follow the rules of the court. 
U.S. District Court Judge Alan B. Johnson noted that attorneys for the sorority sisters who sued the transgender student appeared to have “purposefully included irrelevant stigmatizing allegations” in their lawsuit. Doing so again could result in the case being tossed, he wrote.
In 2023, six members of UW’s Kappa Kappa Gamma sued the sorority for allegedly breaking its bylaws, breaching housing contracts and misleading sisters when it admitted Artemis Langford, a transgender student, by a vote of its members. The 72-page complaint also included allegations against Langford unrelated to the case and details about her physical appearance and sexual orientation, while devoting a fraction of its length to legal claims.
Johnson dismissed the case in August 2023, ruling that the government cannot interfere with how a private, voluntary organization determines its members.
The decision was “without prejudice,” which gave the plaintiffs — Jaylyn Westenbroek, Hannah Holtmeier, Allison Coghan, Grace Choate, Madeline Ramar and Megan Kosar — the option to refile an amended complaint. 
“If plaintiffs wish to amend their complaint, the court advises that they devote more than 6% of their complaint to their legal claims against defendants,” Johnson wrote at the time. “It also counsels Plaintiffs to provide more factual detail, where feasible.” 
Instead of refiling, the plaintiffs appealed Johnson’s decision, but the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver also dismissed the case, leaving the sorority sisters two choices — amend the complaint or ask the lower court for a final judgment. 
They’ve done neither in the 11 months since and are now facing a filing deadline of June 9, as ordered by Johnson, to fish or cut bait.

Backlash and vitriol
While the case has remained in limbo, Langford “has had to bear the backlash of the Plaintiffs’ allegations,” her attorneys argued in their March request to have her dismissed from the case. 
Langford’s attorneys pointed to harassment from conservative figures like Charlie Kirk, who encouraged the plaintiffs to “bully this freak.” 
The attorneys also highlighted comments made by plaintiffs’ counsel on Fox News in the weeks following the lower court’s decision, casting Johnson’s decision as a political one. 
But the request to have Langford removed from the case did not meet all the necessary criteria, Johnson ruled. 
“This court takes very seriously the abuse suffered by Ms. Langford. No person deserves to be the object of such vitriol simply for wanting to make friends and join a club in college,” Johnson wrote in the latest filing. “If Plaintiffs decide to submit a second amended complaint that does not adhere to strictures of Rule 8, or which, relatedly, serves simply as a vehicle through which to publicize allegations about Ms. Langford that are unrelated to the legal issues, they risk dismissal of this action with prejudice.” 
Details
While Johnson rejected the motion to dismiss Langford from the case, he agreed that she “suffers a high degree of prejudice as a result of the continuing litigation of this case,” he wrote. 
Langford’s motion for dismissal included 67 exhibits, including dozens of pages of online comments calling her a pervert, a perpetrator of assault and harassment, and a criminal. 
“Even without the information that Ms. Langford provided in her motion, we believe all parties would agree that [the complaint] objectively contained serious and stigmatizing allegations,” Johnson wrote. 
The court also pointed to roughly a year of uncertainty about whether the plaintiffs would amend their complaint, which has meant mounting attorney’s fees for Langford.
But Johnson stopped short of siding with Langford when it came to the conduct of the plaintiffs’ attorneys. 
About two weeks after Johnson dismissed the case, Cassie Craven, an attorney for the plaintiffs, was a guest on Fox News.  
“We sought a determination in a court of law to look at the bylaws from a contractual and not political standpoint at all,” Craven said in the segment. “Unfortunately, the judge converted this into a political issue.”
Months later, May Mailman, a former attorney for the plaintiffs who now works in the Trump administration, stood on the steps of the Byron White U.S. Courthouse after addressing a skeptical three-judge panel that had tough questions.  
“Women deserve the camaraderie and safety of sororities, but unfortunately, it also appears they first need courts brave enough to say so,” Mailman told reporters.

Langford’s attorneys underscored Mailman’s remarks, as well as comments made by Riley Gaines — a former college swimmer who advocates against the inclusion of transgender athletes in women’s sports. 
At a University of Wyoming event, where Gaines shared the stage with the plaintiffs, she criticized Johnson’s age and accused him of being “on his last breath.”
Langford’s attorneys argued that such behavior by the plaintiffs demonstrated a lack of respect for the legal system and was in part grounds for dismissal. 
Johnson, however, noted the plaintiffs have complied with deadlines and other orders, and had not been given explicit notice that such sanctions were being contemplated. 
“While derogatory comments directed at this Court by outside parties are not relevant here, any public comments made by Plaintiffs’ counsel about this Court’s motives, particularly while this case is ongoing, are a disservice to everyone involved in upholding the rules of law — including Plaintiffs’ counsel themselves,” Johnson wrote. “Evidence of this rule will be taken seriously.”
When contacted Thursday by WyoFile for comment, Craven first responded with a Bible verse. 
“Woe to those who call evil good, and good evil; Who put darkness for light, and light for darkness; Who put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter! Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes, And prudent in their own sight!” she wrote in an email. 
In a second email, Craven took a different approach and confirmed plans to file an amended complaint. 
“We recognize the importance of these sensitive issues and heed the Court’s advice to discuss them with extreme care to protect all parties involved,” Craven wrote. “These kids have all been through enough. The young women we represent look forward to reframing the issues for the Court’s consideration. We have the utmost respect for the judiciary process and the rule of law.”
John Knepper, another attorney for the plaintiffs, told WyoFile in an email that Johnson “is respected as a judge who comports himself with not only fairness but kindness to all that appear before him.”
Knepper also wrote that the plaintiffs “do not, and have never supported the many vile threats against Artemis Langford.” 
The plaintiffs have until June 9 to file an amended complaint, or Johnson’s dismissal will convert to a final judgment and the plaintiffs will no longer have the option to refile, effectively ending the case.

For the fourth year in a row, Louisiana legislators have killed a proposal to prohibit employers from discriminating against new hires based on their gender identity or sexual orientation. 
House Bill 429 by Rep. Delisha Boyd, D-New Orleans, was shot down  Thursday on a 4-6 vote in the House Committee on Labor and Industrial Relations, with all Republicans voting against the measure. Boyd has been the sponsor of the proposal all four years it’s been killed in the same committee. 
Though conservatives on the committee raised concerns Boyd’s legislation would have placed what they see as excessive regulation on private businesses, Louisiana law already prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin and cultural hairstyle. 
Boyd was joined in presenting her bill by Kenny Oubre, an LGBTQ+ New Orleanian who works in human resources. 
“[The bill] does allow people to bring their entire selves to work, and the data does show, if you’re able to bring your entire self to work, you’re able to be more productive,” Oubre said. 
The Louisiana Retailers Association opposed Boyd’s legislation. 
Rep. Roger Wilder, R-Denham Springs, who sponsored legislation last year restricting what bathrooms transgender people can use, raised concerns Boyd’s bill would create a slippery slope. 
“Is the next bill going to be about furries and now that every company has to put a litter box in the corner?” Wilder asked. 
“Where’s the line?” Wilder said. “So do we have any specific examples versus just a conjecture?” 
Oubre told the committee one of Louisiana’s few pediatric cardiologists left Louisiana in 2023 in response to anti-LGBTQ+ legislation state lawmakers had approved as well as the lack of protections for LGBTQ+ people. 
“Twenty nine percent of trans people do live in poverty, and that is a direct result of not having job security,” Oubre said. “So this protection actually allows people to have security, to get a job, to bring their whole selves to work and to be productive.”

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement imposed what it said are standard conditions of release in Öztürk’s case, except for a condition for a GPS ankle monitoring, which will not be included.Öztürk’s lawyer contested a condition that she could be called upon for interviews at will. “This condition is an opportunity for ICE to impose any condition it wants and to call her in for as many interviews as it wants,” said Adriana Lafaille, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union representing Öztürk. Lafaille suggested instead that ICE have a monthly reporting requirement.Additionally, the judge suggested the conditions include stipulations for Öztürk to alert the federal agency and the Burlington Community Justice Center about any plans to travel outside of New England or to change her address.“I do not find Ms. Öztürk to be any sort of risk of flight in this case, but it does seem that ICE should be apprised of where she’s located,” Sessions said during the hearing. Proposed conditions also require that Öztürk cooperate with a potential final order of removal from ICE — only once all legal challenges have been exhausted — and that she not violate any state, local or federal law while under these release conditions. READ MORE
Lafaille opposed the requirements, arguing Öztürk’s is not facing criminal charges and she should not be subject to ICE detainment if she does face criminal charges separate from this case.“None of that would be appropriate,” Lefaille said in an opening statement. “All of that would compound the First Amendment violation in this case.” Instead, to enforce the conditions, Lefaille argued, ICE should alert the court when it thinks Öztürk has violated these terms — “if anything.” The judge suggested striking a condition that Öztürk keep ICE informed about her doctor’s orders and compliance with taking medications, given that the terms of Öztürk’s detainment have nothing to do with substance use or other health concerns. “I don’t understand the purpose of requiring her to disclose medical status,” Sessions said. The hearing also contained details about the case’s progress and timeline. The judge ordered Öztürk’s attorneys to file a briefing on discovery within 30 days and the government’s lawyers to respond to that within 10 days. He also canceled a hearing scheduled for next week.ACLU Vermont did not respond to a request for comment before publication. Read the story on VTDigger here:  Federal judge in Vermont hears conditions for formerly detained Tufts students’ release .",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/rumeyza-ozturk-4-20250414-1024x676.jpg,,,2025-05-15 19:04:54.570601
,DC,2025-05-15 22:30:36+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,The U.S. House GOP backed a child tax credit bump. Josh Hawley wants much more.,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-gop-backed-child-tax-credit-bump-josh-hawley-wants-much-more,,"WASHINGTON — As the “one big, beautiful” budget reconciliation bill soon heads to the Senate, Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri is pushing to significantly expand the child tax credit beyond what House Republican tax writers offered.Hawley, who’s getting a cool reception so far from the GOP colleagues steering tax policy, would claim it as a win for working families in a tax package that critics say is now tilted toward wealthy parents.Hawley proposes to increase the child tax credit to $5,000 per child, way up from the $2,000 set in Republicans’ 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the temporary $2,500 approved Wednesday by a House panel.Additionally, the senator is proposing that parents begin accruing the credit from the first dollar of income earned, meaning that the credit would phase in faster.Hawley also wants the credit to kick in during pregnancy and to be distributed to families in installments throughout the year, rather than in one sum during tax season.Under current law, parents only begin to earn the credit at a rate of 15 cents on every dollar of income once they exceed $2,500 in pay. The credit accrues one child at a time, rather than per child simultaneously.“I think we need to give as much tax relief as we can to working people,” Hawley told States Newsroom Thursday,  outside the Senate chamber.For Hawley, expanding the child tax credit is about combating the “decline of the American family,” as he said on the Senate floor in January.“There's something fundamentally wrong with an economy where the working people, who power that economy, cannot afford to have children that they want,” Hawley said.Reelected in 2024, Hawley has served in the Senate since 2019 — after defeating Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill — and is a former Missouri attorney general considered to be strongly conservative.‘30 proposals on the child tax credit’Hawley, who is not a member of Senate Republican leadership and does not sit on the committee with tax jurisdiction, said he’s in communication with fellow senators about the proposal.A spokesperson for Sen. Mike Crapo of Idaho, who chairs the Senate Committee on Finance, said the leader of the tax writing committee is not currently commenting on any specific provisions under consideration.“Senator Crapo continues to support the child tax credit and has always been open to modifications that provide additional tax relief to working families,” Mandi Critchfield, Crapo’s communications director, said in an emailed statement Thursday.When asked about the prospects for Hawley’s proposal, Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma, a member of the Senate Finance Committee, said there’s a lot of “dials and ideas” swirling around the child tax credit.“There are about 30 proposals on the child tax credit right now, so I'm not going to pick any one of them because there are so many different options and things that can be tweaked out on that. I don't want to see it slashed in half by letting everything expire,” Lankford told States Newsroom on Capitol Hill Thursday.The child tax credit was $1,000 before the 2017 tax law, which expires at the end of the year.Spending cuts paying for tax cutsA major priority for President Donald Trump is extending and expanding his 2017 tax law, the cost of which adds nearly $4 trillion to the nation’s deficit.How to pay for the massive tax extension has been a heated debate among Republicans, who ultimately advanced a bill that cuts billions from Medicaid, the health care program for low-income people and some Americans with disabilities. Hawley in a New York Times op-ed on Monday called such cuts “morally wrong and politically suicidal.”Republicans also have targeted food programs for low-income people as well as clean energy and manufacturing tax credits, all to offset the cost of keeping lower individual tax rates and business tax cuts.In one concession to a demand for a more generous child tax credit, House Republican tax writers on Thursday advanced language that included a temporary $500 increase for it. The short-term hike to $2,500, up from $2,000, would last until 2028. Then the credit reverts back to $2,000.The credit would still phase in at 15 cents on the dollar, one child at a time, for every dollar earned after $2,500 in income, as it does currently.The bill also leaves intact a “refundability cap,” which limits how much parents can receive as a tax refund after they pay the federal taxes they owe. The cap was installed as part of the 2017 tax law.Under a new requirement in the bill, each parent would have to have a Social Security number to access the credit, a change from only requiring Social Security numbers for children.The tax bill, which will eventually be combined with 10 other funding bills to create the reconciliation package, has received criticism for not doing enough to help low-income families.According to an analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, 20 million children in low-income families with a median income of roughly $23,000 will not be eligible for the full tax credit.Kris Cox, director of federal tax policy at the left-leaning CBPP, wrote on social media Tuesday: “Think about who gets helped (and) who doesn’t. A married couple with 2 children earning $400,000 would have their #CTC go up by $1000. A single parent with two children who earns $24,000 as a child care worker would get nothing, $0, from this proposal.”Earlier deal falteredThe current debate about the child tax credit comes after Senate Republicans killed a significantly more generous bipartisan proposal in 2024.Under an agreement struck by Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden, then chair of the Senate Finance Committee, and Missouri Republican Rep. Jason Smith, chair of House Committee on Ways and Means, parents would have been able to receive the credit at a faster pace.Among the provisions in the deal was an agreement to allow the credit to phase in per child simultaneously — so 15 cents on the dollar per child simultaneously.In January 2024, 169 House Republicans voted in favor of the bill. The bill failed on a procedural vote in the Senate. Hawley was one of three Republicans to vote in favor.",,,,2025-05-15 19:04:54.570601

The unit, which began working last year, examines critical incidents and allegations, including deaths, escapes and sexual abuse.

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerThe Department of Corrections is familiar with crises. Whether deaths in custody, violence against staff and incarcerated people, smuggling of contraband or widespread (and mostly unsubstantiated) HR investigations, incidents regularly require examination.So lawmakers created the corrections investigations unit, a group tasked with internal investigations and housed outside the primary DOC office. Staffed in February last year, the unit focuses on incidents including deaths, escapes, contraband movement, threats to staff and people in custody and allegations related to the federal Prison Rape Elimination Act. To date in 2025, the unit has dealt primarily with the latter: 56% of 88 cases investigated have involved sexual harassment or abuse, according to Aaron Reichert, the unit’s director. Roughly 5% of the unit’s cases have revealed a substantiated allegation, he told lawmakers in the House Corrections and Institutions Committee Thursday morning. And if incarcerated people are found to have made a false report, they can face punishment for lying, including being sent to solitary confinement.According to Reichert’s testimony, his team — he and two other investigators — has increasingly tracked the movement of narcotics inside Vermont’s prison, including one unusual intoxicant: paper soaked in insecticide. “They’re trying to get into facilities so they can get that impairment that they’re looking for. There are several internet sites dedicated to selling the paper already pre-soaked so somebody doesn’t have to get the chemicals themselves to do so,” Reichert told the committee. “This is a problem nationwide.”Sometimes, the paper arrives in mail marked “legal confidential,” Reichert said, which corrections staff aren’t allowed to open. To suss out infractions, the investigations unit surveils the state-issued tablets provided to most incarcerated individuals and used for messaging people outside prison. By targeting certain terms, Reichert said the unit has identified people communicating about using banned substances, such as asking friends or family members to make payments for drugs.“If they’re a heavy user, they incur a substantial debt,” Reichert said. “We had one individual from October last year to mid-January of this year, we had established that he had … using friends and family and girlfriends, he had spent $15,000.” —Ethan WeinsteinIn the knowRite Aid expects to close or sell off all five of its Vermont locations as the struggling national pharmacy chain goes through bankruptcy proceedings. In court filings, the company has said it plans to wind down operations at the more than 1,200 drugstores it operates nationwide in the coming months. Among those are locations in Bethel, Brattleboro, Randolph, Springfield and Windsor. Closure would leave at least two of those communities without a pharmacy.Read more about the bankruptcy filings here. — Habib SabetOn the moveThe House and Senate this week agreed on a state budget proposal for the 2026 fiscal year, which starts in July. The chambers’ joint $9.01 billion spending plan — which includes provisions legislators say could limit the impacts of potential federal funding cuts — now heads to Gov. Phil Scott for his consideration.Over several recent meetings, a joint panel of legislative leaders whittled down the bill’s proposed “base” spending — money to fund recurring expenses year-over-year — by about $21 million compared to the version of the bill that was passed by the Senate. Scott, a Republican, had criticized the level of spending in that chamber’s proposal and urged legislators to cut it back. Ultimately, the House and Senate’s joint proposal is still slightly larger than the $8.99 billion spending plan Scott presented to them in January.The compromise version of the budget, H.493, nevertheless won near-unanimous approval in floor votes in both chambers this week. The Senate voted by voice, so no members’ individual votes were on the record; in the House, just three members voted against the bill.Amanda Wheeler, a spokesperson for Scott’s office, signaled support for the budget bill on Thursday afternoon, though she said the governor still needed to review it in full.Read more about the budget compromise here. — Shaun RobinsonGov. Scott signed into law on Thursday S.27, which would use $1 million in funds appropriated to the Treasurer’s Office to erase $100 million in Vermonters’ medical debt, though his announcement also listed a few concerns about the bill. First, he said, the debt has already been written off and, thus, contributed to higher insurance rates. Second, the program’s funding requirements may grow as debt increases. Finally, he worried “we may be disincentivizing repayment.”  The bill, which takes effect July 1, also will prohibit credit reporting agencies from taking into account Vermonters’ medical debt when determining their credit scores. — Kristen FountainVisit our 2025 bill tracker for the latest updates on major legislation we are following. Fashion policeThe House rejected a motion Thursday by Rep. Brian Cina, P/D-Burlington, that was meant to give his colleagues formal permission to be able to take off their dress jackets while on the floor. Going jacket-less is, by some interpretations, against House rules, which state that members must wear “business professional attire” while the chamber is in session.Thus, when the weather warms up each year, it’s tradition for a House member to ask that the rules be suspended for purposes of personal comfort. But Cina, who has been in the chamber for nearly a decade, said in an interview Thursday that he could not recall a year when such a proposal got voted down.After Cina moved to suspend House rules, Speaker Jill Krowinski called a voice vote. But the “nays” sounded extremely similar to the “yeas,” prompting Krowinski to say, “whoof.” Someone then called for a division vote, where members stand to have their votes tallied.The result of the vote was 83 in favor, 38 against — not enough to cross the three-quarters threshold needed for a rules suspension. The vote prompted a mix of laughs and bewildered looks around the chamber. Cina, for his part, said he was genuinely upset by the result.“I’d like to make a point of personal privilege and express disappointment that people would vote to choose for others to suffer needlessly,” he told his colleagues. “And I think that this is telling and symbolic of where we’re at as a civilization.” The Burlington Rep. said he plans to make the motion again Friday morning. — Shaun RobinsonRead the story on VTDigger here:  Final Reading: Department of Corrections investigations unit runs down allegations.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/aaron-reichart-1-20250515-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-05-15 19:04:54.570601

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerA new report provides more details into the fatal shooting of a border patrol agent earlier this year in Coventry as authorities consider bringing new charges against Teresa Youngblut, who has been arrested in connection with the incident.Federal officials said for the first time that Youngblut shot a border patrol agent in the Jan. 20 traffic stop along Interstate 91, according to a one-page summary of a U.S. Customs and Border Protection report on the incident issued this week. But the document, which does not name any of the people involved, does not explicitly say who fired the shot that killed Border Patrol Agent David Maland — an open question for the public in a case that has drawn national attention.The document issued Wednesday by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection was titled, “Summary of Incident: Border Patrol Agent and subject killed during vehicle stop in Vermont.” A U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesperson referred a question Thursday seeking clarification on who fired the fatal shot that killed Maland to the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Vermont.That office, through a spokesperson, declined comment Thursday on Youngblut’s case.Sarah Ruane, a spokesperson for the FBI, the law enforcement agency leading the probe into the incident, stated in an email Thursday that since the “investigation remains active and ongoing,” she could not answer the question of who fired the fatal shot.  In response to VTDigger’s request for the report on which the summary was based, Ryan Brissette, a spokesperson for the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, stated in an email that he couldn’t provide any additional details. “Unfortunately, this is the available information at this time,” he said.READ MORE
Youngblut, 21, from Washington state, was indicted by a federal grand jury in Vermont earlier this year for her alleged role in the shootout that killed Maland and a passenger in the Toyota Prius that Youngblut had been driving. One of the charges alleged that Youngblut “used a firearm while knowingly assaulting, resisting, opposing, impeding, intimidating, and interfering with a U.S. Border Patrol Agent while he was engaged in official duties.” The second charge alleged Youngblut “knowingly carried, brandished and discharged a firearm” during a violent crime.  Neither charge directly stated that Youngblut fired the fatal shot that killed Maland. According to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection report into the incident released Wednesday, a border patrol agent stopped the Toyota Prius at about 2:36 p.m. on Jan. 2 on Interstate 91 in Coventry, less than 10 miles from the Canadian border.Additional border patrol agents and the Vermont State Police arrived at the scene as a border patrol agent requested record checks on the two people inside the vehicle, who have been identified in federal court records as Youngblut, the driver, and Felix Bauckholt, a German national and a passenger in the vehicle who used the first name Ophelia, according to acquaintances and media reports.Border patrol agents in Newport had received a tip a day earlier from U.S. Homeland Security Investigations, which stated that two people had checked into a hotel wearing tactical gear about a week earlier and were seen driving in a blue Toyota Prius, according to the Customs and Border Protection report. The tip said that one of the two people was a German national who had a visa with “unknown immigration status,” the report stated. At about 3:10 p.m. on Jan. 20, border patrol agents asked Youngblut and Bauckholt to get out of the vehicle for questioning, the report stated. Border agents reported that Youngblut “suddenly drew a firearm and opened fire,” striking a border patrol agent. According to the report, there were four border patrol officers on the scene, one of whom returned fire and shot Youngblut in the arm and in the leg. The same agent also reported that Bauckholt “began drawing a firearm from his side.” After Bauckholt refused orders to stop, the border patrol agent reported he shot him twice in the chest. Bauckholt was later pronounced dead at the scene, the report stated.  A couple minutes later, the report stated, the border patrol agent requested “immediate emergency medical services” with one of the agents suffering from a critical gunshot wound to the neck.Border patrol agents and a state police trooper on scene provided aid to the injured border patrol agent and a Newport police officer arrived and drove that agent to North Country Hospital in Newport where he later died, the report stated. The report does not name Maland, but federal court records filed in Youngblut’s criminal case identified the 44-year-old Newport resident as the border patrol agent who was shot and killed in the incident. Youngblut was taken to Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, New Hampshire for treatment for injuries and later released from the hospital. She was soon after charged with federal firearms and assault offenses and has been held in custody since.Youngblut and Bauckholt have since been tied by authorities to a group known as Zizians, who have been linked by law enforcement to a double homicide in Pennsylvania and the murder of a landlord in California. A deadline for filing motions in Youngblut’s criminal case in Vermont had been set for this week. However, federal Chief Judge Christina Reiss granted a request from Youngblut’s attorney, Steven Barth, to extend that deadline to Aug. 7.According to Barth’s motion seeking more time, federal prosecutors had notified him that “substantial” discovery material would be coming in the case. Also, Barth wrote, “the government has indicated that it is actively exploring additional charges.”Federal prosecutors, the filing added, did not object to the requested motions’ deadline extension. Barth could not be reached Thursday for comment.Also in the case, acting U.S. Attorney for Vermont Michael Drescher submitted a filing this week notifying the court that Dennis E. Robinson, a U.S. Department of Justice attorney in the “Violent Crime and Racketeering Section,” will be assisting in Youngblut’s prosecution.Essex County State’s Attorney Vince Illuzzi, who drove by the traffic stop scene before the shooting, said Thursday after reading the report that it still remained unclear to him who fired the fatal shot that killed Maland.“The litmus test will be whether one of the new charges is a murder charge,” said Illuzzi, who is not involved in the investigation or prosecution of the case. Read the story on VTDigger here:  Report sheds new light on deadly shooting of border patrol agent in Vermont.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/maland-procession-3-20250123-1024x676.jpg,,,2025-05-15 19:04:54.570601

Patrick Penn, R-Wichita, shown here at the Statehouse in 2024, announced Thursday that he will resign in June. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Rep. Patrick Penn, a Wichita Republican elected to the House in 2020, sent a letter to the Sedgwick County Republican Party and state officials announcing plans to resign.
John Whitmer, chairman of the county’s GOP organization, said he received the letter, in which Penn wrote he would leave office in June. The notice dated Wednesday did not explain why Penn would exit the Legislature six months after winning reelection to a two-year term.
“I’m aware of the reasons, but I will let him announce that when he chooses to do so,” Whitmer said.
The bulk of Penn’s 85th District is in Sedgwick County, including parts of the cities of Wichita, Bel Aire and Kechi, as well as a small portion of Butler County.
Contents of his resignation letter sent to Secretary of State Scott Schwab indicated that his vision for a prosperous Kansas and his family’s values of faith, family and service would continue to guide him, according to the Wichita Eagle. In addition, the letter said he would work with the next representative to serve the district, and intended to remain “engaged in our community’s future.”
A precinct election was scheduled for 6 p.m. on May 28 to nominate a person to serve the remainder of the conservative Republican’s term.
“Anyone who wants to run for the seat is allowed to do so if they happen to be a resident of the district,” Whitmer said. “I know of at least two or three people who have expressed an interest.”
The person selected to replace Penn would remain a representative-elect until sworn into office after Penn’s resignation was complete. That individual would be eligible to complete Penn’s current term in the House, which would end in January 2027.
Penn, a former U.S. Army officer who deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq, sought the House seat and defeated Rep. Michael Capps in the August 2020 primary. Capps was politically damaged by reports that he conspired with other Sedgwick County Republicans to damage the reputation of the Wichita mayor and engaged in a recorded conversation about how to conceal their involvement.
Penn was a persistent advocate for the Second Amendment right to bear arms and sought passage of legislation that introduced firearm training to elementary students.
He was combative with some statehouse reporters and provoked controversy this year by discussing on the House floor with Rep. Kyler Sweely, R-Hutchinson, the hypothetical idea of instigating an act of violence against former Democratic Rep. Jason Probst. Sweely defeated Probst by less than 300 votes in the 2024 election.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/P6180674-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-05-15 19:04:54.570601

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerMONTPELIER — The Vermont House and Senate this week agreed on a state budget proposal for the 2026 fiscal year, which starts in July. The chambers’ joint $9.01 billion spending plan — which includes provisions legislators say could limit the impacts of potential federal funding cuts — now heads to Gov.

The Senate voted by voice, so no members’ individual votes were on the record; in the House, just three members voted against the bill.Amanda Wheeler, a spokesperson for Scott’s office, signaled support for the budget bill Thursday afternoon, though she said the governor still needed to review it in full.“While not perfect, the Governor is appreciative of the work done by the budget conferees to find a compromise closer to the budget he put forward in January,” she wrote in an email, adding that lawmakers “moved the bill in a positive direction.”Most of the conference committee’s “base” reduction came from its decision to lower, by $19 million, a transfer of money from the state’s general fund to a special fund that pays for child care subsidies and support for child care providers. Scott first proposed assigning that $19 million elsewhere, and the conference committee agreed, rejecting the proposal in the Senate-passed budget to continue drawing on the general fund.Both the governor and the House, in its version of the budget bill, proposed reducing the general fund appropriation by $19 million after a payroll tax set up to support the subsidies brought in more money than expected, while at the same time, the program saw less uptake than expected. The compromise budget also includes a lower proposed increase in the reimbursement rates the state pays to infant and toddler child care providers than the Senate-passed spending plan — 5%, versus 5.5%. Scott’s budget included no such rate increase, while the House’s previous budget proposal would have raised those rates by 4.5%.The committee also put up additional money, as Scott requested in recent weeks, for a program run by the Vermont Housing Finance Agency that provides low-interest loans to developers of rental housing for people with moderate incomes. The panel did not, however, take up another of Scott’s asks to designate ongoing funding for grants to rehabilitate rental housing that has fallen into disrepair. Lawmakers kept money for the Vermont Housing Improvement Program as a “one-time” budget expense, instead.  Senators also conceded 10 new state government positions proposed in their budget, including jobs at the Vermont Labor Relations Board, among others. Members of Scott’s administration had called on legislators to reduce the number of new positions in their proposal. ‘A no-brainer’The conference committee also added language to direct Scott’s administration to use tens of millions of dollars in anticipated state revenue surpluses to plug expected future cuts to federal funding the state receives, some of which could come as a result of the sweeping proposed federal spending legislation being debated in Congress.Normally, Vermont’s budget-writers direct the administration to use surplus revenue for state programs and projects they chose not to fund in a given year’s budget. But this year, it was “a no-brainer” to propose putting that money toward limiting the impact of federal funding reductions, which have already been impacting the state, said Rep. Robin Scheu, D-Middlebury, who chairs the House Appropriations Committee. “We can see that the train wreck is, possibly, coming,” Scheu said in an interview after the House approved the compromise budget Thursday. “So we can reserve what we can — and then, if and when the time comes, prioritize who’s going to get what.” The bill would direct $50 million in surplus revenue to shore up state agencies that are impacted by federal cuts. For relatively small cuts, Scott’s administration could direct that money without input from the Legislature, a decision Scheu said would help the state respond quickly, since lawmakers aren’t in session all year. But relatively larger cuts would require input from a joint legislative panel that’s empowered to meet in the off-session, the budget bill states.It also would set aside up to $60 million for the Legislature “for addressing federal funding shortfalls,” including cuts to federal Medicaid reimbursements.Legislators’ budget also allows state leaders to use up to 10% of the state’s “rainy day” fund — which has about $100 million in it today — to respond to “unforseen or emergency needs,” which could include future changes to federal funding.The federal spending proposal being debated in Congress could make cuts to Medicaid, as well as nutritional benefits for families, in order to extend a set of sweeping tax cuts enacted in President Donald Trump’s first term. The legislation is still far from final.Scheu acknowledged, though, that the state’s money could only go so far. About a third of Vermont’s annual budget — some $3 billion — comes from the federal government, and a large portion of that supports the state’s Medicaid program.“We know that if they cut Medicaid as dramatically as they sometimes talk about, anything we have to offer is like raindrops in the ocean,” Scheu said, referring to the state’s surplus revenue. “So, we can’t solve those issues.

While federal officials said the district improved its practices, the executive director of the Vermont Human Right Commission the decision is “reflective of a national shift in civil rights enforcement priorities.”
Read the story on VTDigger here:  US Department of Justice ends 3-year racial discrimination settlement early at Twin Valley Middle-High School[...]","A sign saying “Teachers are our Marigolds” hangs outside the entrance to Twin Valley Middle High School, in a photo posted to the school’s Facebook page in 2018. The federal government has ended a settlement — which was intended to address and prevent future cases of racial harassment at Twin Valley School District — just over a year early, according to a letter the U.S. Department of Justice sent to the supervisory union last week. The department pointed to the school district’s compliance with the settlement terms by improving policies and practices. But a leader of the Vermont Human Rights Commission expressed concerns about the decision’s potential connection to the dismantling of civil rights enforcement under the Trump administration.The settlement in 2023 between the Twin Valley School District and the U.S. Department of Justice stems from a 2021 complaint filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Vermont to the Vermont Human Right Commission on behalf of a student who formerly attended Twin Valley Middle High School, referred to as a C.B. Under the settlement, the department required the district to assess all relevant policies and procedures, conduct annual school culture assessments, implement training and professional development for school staff, and continue to report relevant information to the department. The agreement started in March 2023, and monitoring was set to continue for three years until July 2026, with an additional 90 days to raise remaining concerns, under the terms. According to the complaint, C.B., the only Black student in the school at the time, faced severe and consistent racially motivated bullying and harassment from fellow students, which school administrators failed to properly respond to. The student developed depression and anxiety, her grades dropped, she withdrew from school sport activities and eventually transferred schools weeks before the school year ended. The federal Department of Justice found in its investigations that the district was aware of and did not adequately respond to individual instances of harassment and to the “hostile educational environment” at Twin Valley Middle-High School, located in the town of Whitingham in Windham County.In the letter to Superintendent Bill Bazyk on May 6, Jonathan Newton, a deputy chief with the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice, and Natacha Lam, an attorney with the division, wrote to notify the district that the three-year agreement would be concluded early. The department’s decision to close the agreement was due to the district “improving its response to and investigation of complaints of discrimination, conducting thorough assessments of the school’s educational environment, and taking responsive action reasonably designed to remedy the harm caused and prevent reoccurrence.”“The District’s proactive and substantial commitment to this endeavor has led to significant improvement in the District’s processes and practices,” according to the letter. “The United States is therefore concluding its formal monitoring of the Agreement and considers this matter fully resolved.”In a statement provided to VTDigger, Lia Ernst, legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Vermont, wrote that the 2023 settlement between the school district and the department was “aimed at systemic, forward-looking change.” The Vermont Human Rights Commission facilitated a subsequent settlement between the former student and district in 2024, in which the district was required to release a public statement to address the harm experienced by the student and the insufficient response of administrators. The student and district also exchanged letters on the harm of the incidents and the district paid the student an undisclosed sum, under the terms of the agreement. The 2024 settlement by the Vermont Human Rights Commision, initiated by the complaint filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in 2021, was intended to “acknowledge and redress the harms our client experienced because of that harassment and hostile educational environment,” Ernst wrote.“We hope that, as a result of these two settlements, current Twin Valley students do not have to go through what our client endured,” Ernst wrote in the statement. READ MORE
‘A dark cloud’Bazyk, superintendent of the Windham Southwest Supervisory Union which oversees Twin Valley School District, started his role in July 2024 and said he could not comment on the 2021 complaint directly.But Bazyk said the school district worked with the U.S. Department of Justice to train teachers and administrators and establish processes to ensure the state’s hazing, harassment, and bullying policies and procedures, as well as federal Title IV reporting processes, would be followed. The school district also worked to build more robust reporting options for students experiencing harassment and developed a diversity, equity and inclusion-based curriculum for students throughout the entire district, Bazyk said.The district also brought in diversity, equity and inclusion consultants and hired a director of diversity, equity and inclusion, but the staff member left the district in summer 2024, and the role has not been refilled, Bazyk said. He said the open case was “obviously a dark cloud” over the Twin Valley Middle High School. The district is more equipped to properly respond to cases in the future and plans to continue to incorporate diversity, equity and inclusion practices in the district, Bazyk said. Bazyk said he thought the district had earned the Department of Justice’s trust that the district would continue these efforts, and “that’s probably why they ended it early,” he said.‘Premature conclusion’Big Hartman, executive director and general counsel for the Vermont Human Rights Commission, said they were disappointed by the early conclusion of the U.S. Department of Justice settlement because “there’s always more you can do to create a more welcoming environment for all students.” The commission did not impose additional measures in the 2024 settlement because the U.S. Department of Justice settlement met the commission’s standards for long-term monitoring to avert future harassment cases, they said.Hartman said the settlement’s early end could be related to the dismantling of civil rights enforcement under the Trump administration. Hartman said the U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights satellite locations have been shuttered, and a swath of staff have been fired under the current administration, weakening the federal office’s ability to investigate discrimination in schools, according to reporting from ProPublica. “The premature conclusion of this settlement is very reflective of a national shift in civil rights enforcement priorities that we’re seeing across the country,” they said. “This shift is a signal to us that we can no longer rely on the federal government to enforce our civil rights protections, especially as they apply for people of color, trans people and individuals with disabilities.”Amid these national changes, Hartman said state level civil rights enforcement is now the “only line of defense.” But, Hartman said Vermont’s civil rights enforcement entity — the commission — is severely understaffed and there is a reported backlog of complaints to the commission from recent years, including a rise in racial harassment cases in schools around the state.“We are seeing a worsening trend of harassment in schools based on race, especially in the past year or two,” Hartman said. “That is very concerning to us, and we know that enforcement, through agencies like ours, is really crucial to trying to remedy the harm and trying to prevent future incidents of discrimination.”Wichie Artu, president of the Windham County NAACP said students who are Black, Indigenous or people of color and their parents consistently report bullying and harassment at schools around the region. He said many students and parents do not understand how to file a complaint, resulting in many being dropped. The Windham County NAACP works with families to guide them through the reporting process and has encouraged the development of coalitions and support networks of peers, staff and family because “this is a ‘it takes a village’ kind of problem,” Artu said. Artu said he could not comment on the changes at the Twin Valley School District. However, he said he has observed generally in his work that school leaders often enact well-intentioned reforms of school policies and curriculum but fail to make a meaningful impact on school culture if they do not center BIPOC student voices in those changes.Artu said the Windham County branch of the NAACP is planning to reach out to the district to learn about the initiatives implemented to improve school culture, and said he hopes the group can work in “solidarity with these efforts.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  US Department of Justice ends 3-year racial discrimination settlement early at Twin Valley Middle-High School.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/twin-valley.jpg,,,2025-05-15 18:09:37.656947

(Matthew Perschall for Louisiana Illuminator)Louisiana lawmakers have pumped the brakes on exempting college athletes’ name, image and likeness compensation from income taxes as they work to approve a lean state budget. 
Two legislators who filed bills to exempt NIL payments from income taxes have said they will not pursue votes on their legislation, citing perception issues with giving well-paid student-athletes a tax break while tightening the belt on critical state services. 
“It didn’t seem like there was an appetite for creating a new deduction,” Rep. Rashid Young, D-Homer, said. “It’s partly perception and then partly real dollars.” 
Young’s House Bill 168 would have exempted the first $12,500 of student-athletes’ NIL income from state taxes. It would have aligned the exemption with the standardized deduction offered to every other Louisiana resident. It’s not clear if this legislation is necessary for the athletes to receive the deduction, but Young said he wanted to make sure they get it. 
House Bill 166 by Rep. Dixon McMakin, R-Baton Rouge, would have exempted the entirety of an athlete’s NIL income from state taxes.
Both lawmakers said they would consider bringing back the legislation depending on the outcome of a study on name, image and likeness deals that lawmakers will undertake. 
Young’s House Resolution 15 will create an NIL task force that will bring together lawmakers, college athletics officials, student-athletes and private business to discuss related issues and make recommendations to the legislature. Additional proposals are expected next year. 
Young said he hoped to get more transparency on athletes’ NIL compensation. Louisiana laws exempt information related to NIL deals from public disclosure. 
Fiscal analyses for the two bills note that Louisiana’s four higher education systems have 427 athletes with NIL deals worth a combined $17 million for the 2024-25 school year. Athletes are only required to report deals worth more than $600, meaning this is not a full picture of NIL compensation for Louisiana athletes. 
Though legislators are not taking action this year, Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry signed an executive order Tuesday that aims to give colleges and universities legal cover to directly pay college athletes. 
The order purports to prohibit the NCAA, an athletic conference or another organization with oversight of college athletics from taking action against Louisiana schools that directly compensate athletes or facilitate NIL deals for them. 
NCAA rules currently prohibit the paying of players, but athletes are allowed to make money through NIL endorsement deals.

(USDA Photo)A study by the University of Southern California estimates hundreds of thousands of pounds of toxic metals have been dumped onto forests during aerial fire retardant drops during the past decade potentially causing harm to wildlife, specifically endangered and threatened species, according to new federal lawsuit filed against the U.S. Forest Service.
The bright red fire retardant, often seen on television being dumped from large air tankers, contains cadmium, selenium, chromium, and other metals, according to the lawsuit, which was filed by the Forest Service Employees for Environmental Ethics on May 7. The organization is a non-profit made up of current and former USFS employees dedicated to protecting the country’s forests and reform within the agency.
“This stuff is astonishingly dirty,” said Andy Stahl, the executive director of the organization. “Why the hell are we using such a dirty retardant?”

The chemicals found in some retardants can also be fatal to aquatic life and high concentrations of the metals can be toxic to humans, too. The lawsuit focuses on protections for wildlife, alleging the federal agencies are violating the Endangered Species Act.
“At the risk of doing the regulatory agencies job for them, Plaintiff points out the obvious – toxic metals in aerial retardant are bad for many Threatened and Endangered species,” the lawsuit reads.
The National Marine Fisheries Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service are also defendants in the lawsuit. The U.S. Forest Service did not respond to a request for comment.
The plaintiffs are seek acknowledgement and disclosure of the toxic metals being used, as well as biological opinions from other agencies assessing the impact of the fire retardant on threatened and endangered animals.
The USC Study, which is referenced in the lawsuit, was published in 2024 after researchers bought fire retardant and put it in a mass spectrophotometer to determine the chemical make-up of the retardant.
“Based on information and belief, the Forest Service has known about the presence of some, or all, of these metals in aerial fire retardant since well before the publication of the USC study,” the lawsuit reads.
The study estimated that between 2009 and 2021, about 840,000 pounds of toxic metals were added into the environment due to fire retardant drops in the United States.
Companies only had to disclose part of their retardant formula, according to the study, necessitating the mass spectrometry test. Previous concerns around retardants mostly centered on it containing ammonium polyphosphates, which can kill wildlife.
“They’re the ones who have really blown open this issue that retardant, the Phos-Chek retardant, contains astonishingly high levels of heavy metals like cadmium,” Stahl said. “We’ve suspected that for years.”
‘Most expensive, least effective’
The organization filed the suit in Missoula in part due to its long association with wildland firefighting.
The United States Department of Agriculture has a Technology and Development Center in Missoula, which includes a lab where fire retardants are tested and certified. Missoula has been at the center of aerial firefighting since the 1940s.
“Missoula tends to be a focal point with fire retardant,” said Jack Cohen, a retired U.S. Forest Service fire research scientist with decades of fire experience. 
He also worked at the Missoula Technology and Development Center and doesn’t think fire retardant’s work.
“It’s just about the most expensive, least effective mechanism of fire suppression,” Cohen said.
Drops can be impacted by winds, which can also ground aircraft in the first place. Embers can also move over retardant lines and in a famous example, jumped over a six-lane interstate near Santa Rosa during a 2017 fire.
Direct attack on a fire, or when firefighters’ objective is to contain the blaze as quickly as possible, is also a combination of people, machines and tools. rarely, if ever, is only one method used to work a wildfire.

Cohen said multiple studies into whether retardant drops have any impact on the perimeter of fires have shown inconclusive results as to whether or not they work.
The assumption that retardant drops are effective is a dangerous notion, especially in legal arguments, Cohen said. In a previous lawsuit filed by the ethics group, a Missoula judge ruled that fire retardant does pollute water, but allowed agencies to continue the practice.
“The judge admitted that that was happening and essentially decided against withholding the use of the retardant based on the statement, something on the order of it is conceivable that greater harm to the environment, people and their property would occur without using fire retardant and that assumes that fire retardant is effective” Cohen said. “And to me, that’s very troubling.”
For Stahl, the drops are often about optics and he went on to say the vast majority of aerial retardant drops are ineffective. They are also only used on about 5% of fires, he added.
“Some of the Missoula Fire Science researchers have said to me, quietly, we would accomplish the same damn thing if we just put red food coloring into water and dumped it out of airplanes,” Stahl said. “It would look good on CNN. It wouldn’t be bad for the environment, and it would be just as effective in fire suppression.”
‘The cowboy coming over the ridge’
Fighting fires is expected to get more expensive across the country as the climate turns drier and hotter.
Forestry practices in the United States have also focused on suppression, necessitating the armies of firefighters and equipment fire agencies utilize each year. According to the National Interagency Fire Center, the five-year average for suppression efforts in the U.S., is $3 billion each year.
Prescribed fires, or fires set with the purpose of clearing out fuels or other land management goals, are sometimes used as a tool by fire agencies. 
Decades of suppression have left many forests overgrown and full of dead wood, generally regarded in the firefighting world as “fuel” that can make fires more intense. 
Prescribed burns seek to take some of that intensity out of wildfires by removing fuels ahead of time. 
But there’s a problem there too, Cohen said — the scale of prescribed burns is not nearly enough.
“Prescribed burning is pointless the way we’re doing it now,” Cohen said.
  A DC-10 air tanker drops fire retardant on Magpie Gulch during the Horse Gulch Fire on July 15, 2024 (Photo courtesy of Northern Rockies Incident Command).
Stahl brought up the example of recent wildfires in Minnesota. Prior to European colonization, the area was an oak savannah that did not have dense forest.
“We’ve committed all the great plains to croplands and have suppressed fire, we now have forests and these in Minnesota and similar northern tier states that used to be savanna, oak grasslands, and those forests when the humidity is low and the wind is high, which, by the way, means the airplanes that dump either water or retardant can’t fly. We get these fires, and they got lots to burn, a lot of biomass to burn.”
To address the issue, Cohen said the focus should be on building and planning. He views community wildfire risk as a structure ignition problem – the way we build makes structures too easily burned. He said if more fire resistant buildings are constructed with fire resistance in mind, fire crews can have a better plan to fight fires and fewer structures will be lost. 
No community can fully be fireproofed, Cohen said, but that doesn’t mean it hurts to try. The more buildings that are protected, the less limited fire resources are stretched.
“We can reduce the number of ignitions that do occur and can be matched by our fire protection,” Cohen said. 
Communities across the country are updating their fire readiness and Montana Sen. Tim Sheehy has made a point of introducing legislation on the topic, including some for aerial response to fires.
The problem for some, though, is whether aerial bombardment is the most effective strategy for fighting wildfires. And whether the cost, both financially and on the environment, is worth it.
“We do it because it looks good on CNN. It’s the cowboy coming over the ridge,” Stahl said. “Everybody’s real excited. And they see the retardant bomber arrive and the red stuff come out of the plane. They think, ‘Oh, my God, we’re saved.’ Yeah, not so much.”

The Montana Department of Corrections on Monday moved 50 inmates form the Montana Women’s Prison in Billings to the former Riverside Special Needs Unit in Boulder, according to a press release from the department.
The move is intended to alleviate overcrowding in the state’s correctional facilities.
Following Monday’s move, the Women’s Prison in Billings has a population of 200, according to the state’s secure facility dashboard, while DOC officials say another 62 female inmates are awaiting placement from county jails. The DOC stated that 47 of those inmates in county jails have been waiting for transfer to the prison for more than 30 days, but expects to move them to the Billings facility by the end of the month.
The Riverside Facility in Boulder was most recently used as a unit of the Montana State Prison for male inmates with serious, long-term medical needs. The facility housed 25 inmates, who were transferred to the state prison earlier this month, according to DOC.
The facility underwent minor renovations to accommodate the larger population of female inmates.
Representatives from DOC did not immediately respond to calls or emails asking about the extent of the renovations or changes to staffing levels at the facility.
Overcrowding has been a growing issue among Montana’s correctional facilities, and the state has resorted to sending hundreds of inmates to privately run prisons in other states in order to make do.
Under contracts with CoreCivic, a private prison operator, Montana currently has 239 inmates in the Tallahatchie County Correctional Facility in Mississippi, and 364 in the Saguaro Correctional Facility in Arizona.
Despite the out-of-state transfers, several Montana facilities remain over capacity. A CoreCivic run facility in Shelby, has 768 inmates but an operational capacity of 753. A federal jury recently found CoreCivic liable for failing to protect an inmate in that facility from a beating, and awarded the victim nearly $28 million.
Among state-run facilities, the Montana State Prison is 58 inmates over capacity, with a current population of 1,594.
Montana’s community correctional facilities include another 1,616 individuals in treatment centers, prerelease centers, and assessment and sanction centers.
During the 2025 Legislative Session, lawmakers appropriated $436 million to address capacity issues throughout the state.
House Bill 833, sponsored by Rep. John Fitzpatrick, R-Anaconda, proposes spending roughly $250 million to construct a new women’s prison or renovate an existing facility. That bill is awaiting action from Gov. Greg Gianforte, a Republican.
Fitzpatrick also included DOC funding in the state’s long-range building appropriations bill, House Bill 5, including $171 million for expansions at the Montana State Prison.
On April 29, Gianforte, Fitzpatrick, and DOC Director Brian Gootkin held a groundbreaking ceremony for a $156 million infrastructure project to build more housing units at the state prison, a project that was funded during the 2023 Legislative Session.
“We are extremely thankful for the support of Governor Gianforte and the members of the Montana Legislature to provide us with a generational investment to modernize and expand our correctional infrastructure,” Gootkin said in a press release. “Not only will we have the capacity we need to accommodate our inmate population, but we will be able to provide a safer, healthier work environment for our employees.”

The U.S. Census Bureau released new July 2024 city population estimates Thursday.
In New York City, a recent city planning report suggested that “two consecutive years of growth suggest that pandemic-era losses were short-lived.” The city is still almost 328,000 short of its 2020 population, however.
Los Angeles returned to the list of top growth cities for the first time since 2016, according to the Census Bureau.

Are you a teacher, nurse or skilled trades worker looking to buy a house or condo in today’s market? We’d like to talk to you about the experience of trying to buy a home with a household income of around $75,000 a year — email Tim Henderson at thenderson@stateline.org. 

The largest one-year population increases for mid-2023 to mid-2024 were New York City (87,184), Houston (43,217), Los Angeles (31,276), and the Texas cities of San Antonio (23,945) and Fort Worth (23,442). The same cities were in the top five the previous year, but the growth is a big turnaround from 2021-22, when New York City lost almost 100,000 people and Los Angeles gained only about 2,000.
A new interest in living in big cities could be impacting rents: Zillow reported this week that there now are eight cities, double the number from 2020, where renters need more than a $100,000 annual income to afford typical rent: New York City ($145,000 needed), San Jose, California ($137,000), Boston ($127,000), San Francisco ($124,000), San Diego ($123,000), Los Angeles ($119,000), Miami ($110,000) and Riverside, California ($103,000).
Homes for sale in the fastest-growing city areas also are getting further out of reach for even moderate-income buyers, according to a National Association of Realtors report also released Thursday. The New York City and Los Angeles areas were listed as “moving in the wrong direction” on affordability, “reflecting a growing divide between what homes actually cost and what local families can afford.”
For instance, even a Los Angeles-area family with a $200,000 income can afford less than a third of the homes listed for sale, including condominiums and townhouses, according to the report.
Houston, San Antonio and the Dallas-Fort Worth area were listed among three tiers as “stuck in the middle” of affordability, “showing signs of progress, yet still falling short of offering real affordability to most families.”
For the four years combined after the COVID-19 pandemic started in 2020, both New York City and Los Angeles have not completely recovered population. New York City is down almost 328,000 people and Los Angeles is still short about 21,000 since the 2020 census, but they remain the nation’s two largest cities.
The largest percentage growth since 2020 was in some fast-growing suburbs: Westlake, Florida, near Palm Beach, has grown to 7,664, more than eight times its 2020 population, and Josephine, Texas, near Dallas, has quadrupled in size to 8,807. Medicine Lake, Minnesota, west of Minneapolis, also quadrupled, to 1,343.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)A cybercriminal group breached the state’s public benefits portal last July, lingered inside the network’s backend for five months, and triggered hundreds of firewall alerts when it transferred gigabytes of Rhode Islanders’ data to its own servers in November.   
But RIBridges system vendor and manager Deloitte, a multinational firm valued at $67.2 billion last year, didn’t know the system had been hacked until threat actor Brain Cipher took credit for the breach on its blog in early December. 
“Deloitte missed some issues that we certainly hold them responsible for,” Gov. Dan McKee said at a Thursday morning press conference. “We also want to make sure that people know that we will pursue all avenues in our efforts to ensure accountability.”
One of the things Deloitte appears to have missed was its own incident logs, according to the long-awaited RIBridges forensic report by CrowdStrike from Dec. 16, 2024, to Jan. 31, 2025, and finally released to the public in an abbreviated form Thursday morning. The state hired the Austin, Texas-based cybersecurity firm to conduct the third-party analysis. 
Full forensic reports of cyber breaches are not typically available for security reasons, but the publicly released summary contains several telling details, although some are confined to footnotes. One of those revelations in the fine-print: CrowdStrike did not have complete access to crucial logs needed for its analysis, such as those relating to firewall alerts or multifactor authentication (MFA), the means by which modern networks confirm and allow user access.     
“We are concerned. Obviously, that is an issue,” the state’s Chief Digital Officer Brian Tardiff said at the press briefing. “The logs were not made available. That doesn’t mean that they weren’t there.”
Still, Tardiff added the exclusion of the logs has prompted the state to review its policies regarding vendor contracts, so that vendor agreements reflect “our expectations and policy requirements for retention of logs,” he said. 
“The State’s Enterprise Policy includes logging requirements, which vendors are supposed to follow,” Karen Greco, a spokesperson for the Department of Administration, wrote in an email to Rhode Island Current shortly after the press conference. Greco pointed to the state’s audit and accountability policy for vendors in a follow-up email, which mandates that contractors and vendors log authentication events, firewall changes, and remote access, and keep those records for six months or more.
The CrowdStrike findings also led the state to revise the total number of people affected by the breach. The state notified 657,000 people in January that their personal information may have been compromised if they had previously applied for benefits like food stamps and Medicaid, or signed up for health insurance via the state marketplace.
But 114,879 people were ruled out after the forensic review. However, the investigation identified another 107,757 people who had not been discovered in the initial sweep, including about 30,000 people who never applied for benefits managed through the eligibility system. The final tally now stands at 644,401 people whose data — including Social Security numbers, birthdates, and potentially health information — may have been exposed.
The state will be sending out a fresh batch of letters to the newly identified residents with information on how they can access free credit monitoring services through Experian, Jonathan Womer, the administration department’s director, said. The deadline to sign up for free credit monitoring is Aug. 31.
McKee said the state is pondering legal action and that the office of Attorney General Peter Neronha is looking into the matter. 
“Well, obviously we’re not pleased by it and we’re acting accordingly,” McKee said. “That this would be undetected for that period of time is something that is just unacceptable.”
“At this time, the State is pursuing all available remedies,” AG spokesperson Tim Rondeau said in an email.
Deloitte did not respond to a request for comment. But the company did RSVP to the governor when he asked a representative to attend Thursday’s press briefing. 
“We did invite Deloitte to be here today. They declined,” McKee said.

It started with a pilfered username and password
A total of 338 different environments constitute the RIBridges system, Tardiff said, and 28 were accessed by the cybercriminals. Brain Cipher relied on good old fashioned credential theft to begin its invasion, according to the CrowdStrike report. On July 2, 2024, a username and password pilfered from a Deloitte representative initially opened a gate to the system’s backend through a VPN (virtual private network), Tardiff said, although neither he nor CrowdStrike could specify how the criminals gained those credentials. 
From there, the criminals exercised patience. Tardiff said the hackers used “a series of activities to maintain connection.” To set up camp in two RIBridges servers, the attackers used a Windows exploit to run their own malicious program that would expand their privileges across the system’s infiltrated areas. CrowdStrike was unable to recover the program used.     
The masquerade continued on July 12 when attackers set up a reverse proxy tool, which essentially served as a backdoor into the system, one only the hackers could access. With the reverse proxy in place, Brain Cipher could move in and out of the system incognito, appearing as normal network traffic along the way. 
The attackers browsed files, folders and portions of the RIBridges system between July and November. Despite tripping a firewall alarm on Sept. 10, 2024 that blocked an outgoing connection, hackers managed to move data to their own server in the final weeks of November, with this migration triggering 397 “Large Outbound Transfer” alerts along the way. 
“The technology did its job, but there are people and processes that have to follow up on what the technology triggers,” Tardiff told reporters. “That’s part of what we’re continuing to look into.”
Brain Cipher last accessed its remote connection on Thanksgiving Day. On Dec. 4, 2024, the cybercriminal gang posted a threat on its dark web blog that it planned to leak Deloitte’s information within weeks. Deloitte in turn notified the state a day later.
But state officials did not take the network offline until Dec. 13, 2024, when they discovered the reverse proxy tool. Had it remained in the system, the tool could have allowed the criminals to remain there undetected and possibly deploy ransomware, according to the report.
Rethinking control
CrowdStrike found no evidence, however, that the hackers were able to enter other state networks. Still, data seemingly unrelated to RIBridges comprised portions of the leaked data found in independent analyses.
The situation is “fairly complicated,” Tardiff said, so he summarized why the breach may have affected people who never applied for benefits themselves. 
States are granted “a single connection to the Social Security Administration” (SSA) for its filesharing and identity verification services, Tardiff said. In Rhode Island, RIBridges is designated as the sole pass-through portal for this data. Agencies unrelated to RIBridges may use it indirectly, which accounted for many of the newly identified people who may have been affected.
That included two people with data connected through the Department of Children Youth and Families, six people whose data passed through the Office of Child Support Services, and 29,629 people whose data was submitted to the National Directory of New Hires, which employers use to report new employees to comply with federal laws meant to enforce child support and prevent benefit fraud.
“No other state data systems or any federal data systems were compromised, only the pass-through files from the state agencies identified,” Tardiff said.
The link to download and access the stolen and published data posted on the dark web “has been largely unusable,” Tardiff said, adding the state has asked Deloitte and CrowdStrike to continue monitoring the Brain Cipher site. 
But it appears that Brain Cipher revamped its download page on April 14, according to Connor Goodwolf, a cybersecurity researcher who has followed the breach since its genesis last December. Goodwolf in a text to Rhode Island Current, said the stolen data appears to be more easily accessible than before.
“The brain cipher download for the data now works uninterrupted,” Goodwolf said via text message Thursday.
Rhode Island’s IT department wants a fresh install of 15 full-time roles

In the meantime, Tardiff said the state is a few weeks away from tentatively selecting a vendor to “modernize” RIBridges, a procurement project that started last September. The revamped benefits platform could take 18 to 24 months to fully develop and roll out, McKee added. Until then, the state is stuck with Deloitte.
But the state is seeking to minimize its reliance on the vendor. Thursday’s press conference came two days after Tardiff and Womer visited the Senate Committee on Finance to make the case for rebooting the state IT department with a budget-neutral request for 15 new full-time IT hires, including an RIBridges Technical Lead. The ask comes via one of McKee’s fiscal 2026 budget amendments.
That request for a more localized IT workforce “was influenced by the [CrowdStrike] analysis, the outcome of the analysis and the identification that we need qualified state employees managing state systems,” Tardiff said.
Can in-house staff defend and monitor the state’s systems better than an outside contractor like Deloitte?
“Directly under our control? Yes,” Tardiff told reporters.

SPRINGFIELD — A Senate committee on Wednesday advanced a measure aiming to limit the circumstances under which tenants can be evicted due to local “crime-free housing” ordinances.

The measure was backed by housing advocates who argued the crime-free ordinances have been used to evict people in instances where the actual residents of the homes in question committed petty offenses or no crimes at all. But law enforcement and municipal groups countered that limiting local authority to enforce crime-free or nuisance ordinances would take away policies that can be used to revitalize neighborhoods.

The Senate Executive Committee approved Senate Bill 2264 on Wednesday, which cracks down on crime-free housing policies after a recent investigation by the Illinois Answers Project and The New York Times. It found that there were more than 2,000 cases in 25 Illinois cities where crime-free housing ordinances were enforced from 2019 to 2024, with about 500 of those cases involving evictions.

The investigation found that only a third of those 2,000 violations were for serious crimes like drug charges or felony convictions. The other approximately 1,300 violations were due to misdemeanors or noncriminal offenses, “many of which were never pursued by prosecutors,” according to the reporting.

Crime-free housing ordinances in Illinois municipalities began cropping up in the early 1990s in attempts to remove violent criminals, drug dealers and nuisance tenants who frequently disturb their neighbors at rental properties. While the local ordinances have been used to achieve those goals, advocates say they are sometimes abused to apply to people who aren’t even accused of crimes, much less convicted of them.

In recent years, many cities have enforced the laws so aggressively that virtually any contact tenants have with law enforcement has been used as a reason to bring violations against tenants, according to the news reporting. That includes evictions of tenants who called the police to request assistance, which led housing advocates to push for the new bill.

In 2015, Illinois lawmakers passed a law prohibiting the ordinances from being used to evict victims of domestic violence. At the time, some cities were counting calls to police made by victims of domestic violence as nuisance calls, resulting in the eviction of the victims, the Chicago Tribune reported.

If enacted, SB 2264 would bar municipalities from penalizing tenants for calling the police to request assistance from law enforcement officers. It would also prohibit nuisance and crime-free ordinances from being applied to tenants who are not themselves accused of crimes and would block ordinances from being applied to tenants based on who they associate with, unless the association itself is a crime.

Any municipality enforcing crime-free housing policies would have to hire a crime-free housing coordinator, who would handle cases where law enforcement informs a landlord that a tenant should be evicted. The coordinator would review cases and decide whether the tenant’s action warrants eviction.

Tenants would be given the right to challenge enforcement action in circuit court, and municipalities would be required to create a hearing process for those facing enforcement actions.

Illinois Association of Chiefs of Police Executive Director Kenny Winslow, who previously served as Springfield police chief, called the city’s crime-free housing laws a “usual crime prevention crime reduction tool.” His organization opposed the measure, which passed with only Democratic support.

“When utilized right, it can be a revitalization tool for a neighborhood,” he said.

Michael Banske, director of the Illinois Crime Free Association, disputed claims that the ordinances are overused.

“We do not displace families for domestic violence situations, for excessive calls for the police to come there,” he said in committee. “Nuisance abatement is completely separate. Oftentimes in a municipality, both of those are handled by the same officer or the same division, but they are, in fact, separate.”

The measure still needs approval from the full House and Senate before it would head to the governor for consideration.

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Rite Aid to close or sell all 5 Vermont locations.","The sign on a Rite Aid Pharmacy in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on April 14, 2020. File photo by Gene J. Puskar/APRite Aid expects to close or sell off all five of its Vermont locations as the struggling national pharmacy chain goes through bankruptcy proceedings. In court filings, the company has said it plans to wind down operations at the more than 1,200 drugstores it operates nationwide in the coming months. Among those are locations in Bethel, Brattleboro, Randolph, Springfield and Windsor. According to court documents, Rite Aid is actively trying to auction off rather than immediately shutter many of its locations, and it’s possible some or even all of the Vermont locations could remain open under the auspices of another pharmacy brand. For now, Rite Aid has said, locations will stop taking on new retail inventory while transferring prescriptions to other nearby pharmacies when possible as the company attempts to sell off its assets.“It’s all very uncertain,” said Sandy Rosa, executive director of the Vermont Pharmacists Association. “It’s really kind of frightening. This is not good for the people of Vermont for pharmacy access.”Indeed, if the Vermont locations do not change hands, the resulting closures could have dire implications for parts of the state that already have severely limited access to the medicine and health care provided by pharmacies. Pharmacy closures can create “pharmacy deserts” or areas without easy access to pharmaceutical care. In one recent nationwide analysis, communities in rural areas are considered pharmacy deserts if the nearest pharmacy is 10 miles away or more. In urban areas, pharmacy deserts are square-mile areas without drugstores.  READ MORE
Currently, the Rite Aid drugstores are the only pharmacies operating in both Bethel and Windsor, and the locations’ closure meaning both towns would likely become pharmacy deserts. “Patients are going to be really up a creek, as it were,” Rosa said. “It’ll take a while in terms of a transition, but it’s going to be fraught.” As Vermont’s independent pharmacies have shuttered their doors and large chains like CVS and Walgreens have closed thousands of locations nationwide, pharmacy access is becoming a struggle in more of the state.According to the state’s Board of Pharmacy, 28 pharmacies permanently closed in Vermont between 2019 and 2024. And already this year, Walgreens has shuttered at least three drugstores in Burlington, Newport, and Montpelier.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Rite Aid to close or sell all 5 Vermont locations.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Rite-Aid-Pharmacy-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-05-15 18:09:37.656947

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)Judge Hannah Dugan appeared at her arraignment Thursday in Milwaukee’s federal court and pleaded not guilty to charges that she helped a man elude federal agents in the Milwaukee County courthouse earlier this year. 
Dugan was arrested in April and was indicted Tuesday by a grand jury on two counts, concealing a person from arrest and obstruction of proceedings. The charges could carry penalties of six years of prison, years of supervision, and at least $350,000 in fines. 
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
Dugan appeared with three attorneys, and did not comment to reporters after the hearing was over. Attorneys mentioned in court that a small number of video excerpts have been shared with the defense, but discovery is still ongoing. 
Judge Lynn Adelman has been assigned to preside over Dugan’s jury trial, which was set to start on July 21, with a pretrial hearing July 9. Jury selection is expected to be lengthy and complicated. A motions hearing was set in Judge Nancy Joseph’s court on May 30.
Dugan is accused of escorting a man into a public hallway with access to elevators after federal agents arrived outside her courtroom, where the man, a Mexican immigrant, was having a routine hearing in a misdemeanor battery case.
The agents had an administrative warrant for his arrest, which was not signed by a judge and did not give agents the authority to enter the courtroom. While the agents waited in the hallway outside, Dugan directed the man and his attorney out a side door that exited into the same hallway. The agents saw him leave the room and one rode down the elevator with him before he was arrested later on the street. 
Outside the Milwaukee federal courthouse on Thursday, a crowd of about 200 people gathered, including elected officials, activists and local residents showed up early in the morning to support the circuit court judge. Speakers led chants through a microphone on the courthouse steps.
One person at the rally, Erik Fanning, said that the charges against Dugan feel “preposterous,” and argued that a judge would be knowledgeable about what the law would and would not allow her to do in courtroom situations.

“As many people in this country have found out, the law can be manipulated in order to serve an interest that’s sometimes more powerful than the law, as we’re seeing right now in this country,” Fanning told Wisconsin Examiner. “And so that’s the fear here with me.”
After her arrest, Dugan was suspended by the Wisconsin Supreme Court, and protests erupted in Milwaukee County calling for the charges against her to be dropped.
If the case against Dugan succeeds, “That’s a powerful statement,” Fanning said. “That’s a powerful move in this game that they’re playing with our justice system.”
Shortly after Dugan’s arrest, FBI Director Kash Patel posted on social media praising her detention, then deleted the post. 
For Fanning, Dugan’s arrest felt like a “made-for-TV” moment created by the Trump administration. More press attention on Dugan’s arrest and trial validates his own instincts that “this is a watershed moment,” he said.  
“The media should be interested, because it’s a frightening, very important moment,” Fanning said. “Remember who this administration’s leader is. It’s a TV guy. It’s a manipulating the press, and propaganda guy…So everything they do is a TV show.”

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Legislative leaders and Gov. Tim Walz on Thursday, at a press conference in the Capitol’s golden-fixtured reception room, proudly announced a long-sought, bipartisan deal that would finally bring the Legislature one step closer to passing a two-year budget of roughly $66 or $67 billion, about five billion less compared to the current two-year cycle.
Progressive Democrats were outraged, however, shouting and banging on the door into the room from which they were barred entry, drowning out Walz and the leaders’ remarks about their hard work and friendly negotiations.
The lawmakers shouted “don’t kill immigrants” and “One Minnesota, right?” — a dig at the governor’s 2018 election slogan.
The source of their anger: The budget deal that would end access to state-subsidized health insurance — MinnesotaCare — for undocumented adults. Undocumented children would still be eligible for the program.
Because of the change to MinnesotaCare, progressive Democrats in the House and Senate have vowed to withhold their votes for the measure, which would be included in a health omnibus bill.
Lawmakers won’t vote up or down on the budget, however. They’ll vote on a series of bills funding various government operations, from schools to parks to health and social services.
The big question was whether the progressive Democrats — particularly in the 34-33 Democratic-controlled Senate — would block all government spending bills, or just the health bill that would repeal MinnesotaCare for undocumented people.
Rep. Cedric Frazier, DFL-New Hope, said the People of Color Indigenous Caucus is focused on voting down the MinnesotaCare provision in the health bill, while evaluating whether to vote against more of the budget over the next few days. If progressive Democrats were to vote no across the board, Senate Majority Leader Erin Murphy, DFL-St. Paul, would need some Republican votes, and it wasn’t clear Thursday that she had them.
Senate Minority Leader Mark Johnson, R-East Grand Forks, didn’t sign the budget agreement and said Thursday he wasn’t sure whether his caucus would vote for the budget agreement as written.
But in a statement, Johnson was more forceful: “While the final deal includes some needed reforms, it falls short of acknowledging we need bipartisan support to stop the harmful progressive policies hurting small businesses and working families. We still have a lot of work before the end of the session.”
On top of all this, time is running out: The legislative session ends on Monday, and the Minnesota Legislature will likely need a special session to pass its 2026-2027 budget.
Here are five key takeaways from Thursday’s budget deal announcement.
‘We are going to fight this ‘till the very end’
Members of the progressive POCI Caucus said they were blindsided by the deal to roll back MinnesotaCare for undocumented adults. At a press conference, about 30 Democratic lawmakers vowed they will not vote for it.
Sen. Alice Mann, DFL-Edina, said taking away health care for undocumented immigrants was Republicans’ top priority and accused Republicans of not caring if these Minnesotans die due to a lack of health care.
“What we have is a party who is willing to take away insulin from diabetics, inhalers from people with asthma, cancer treatments for people who just want a few more years with their children, all for political points, all for political gain,” Mann said. Republicans, she said, are telling immigrants that “they can suffer, they can die and we don’t care.”
“We are going to fight this ‘till the very end,” Mann said.

MinnesotaCare was created in 1992 to help close the gap in coverage for low-income working families who make more than the income threshold for Medicaid, which is called Medical Assistance in Minnesota.
In 2023, the DFL trifecta expanded the social safety net to include undocumented immigrants, beginning on Jan. 1 this year.
Enrollment has surpassed estimates, and Republicans argue undocumented people should be taken off the rolls to save money and discourage people from moving here for coverage.
The Department of Human Services says that its most recent data show that as of April 24, 20,187 undocumented people had enrolled in MinnesotaCare. The program is fee-for-service, meaning the state only pays claims after services are administered.
DHS says it has received 4,306 claims for service, costing Minnesota $3.9 million. This is nearly $1 million over what the state had projected by this date, according to DHS. Some of the undocumented immigrants on MinnesotaCare pay a monthly premium, like other residents who are on the program.
State Sen. Jordan Rasmusson, R-Fergus Falls, who has been at the forefront of the Republican effort to repeal the expansion of MinnesotaCare for undocumented people, celebrated the deal in a statement: “This change is a benefit for Minnesota taxpayers and is an acknowledgement that including all illegal immigrants in MinnesotaCare made us a magnet for those who broke the law to enter our country.”
That’s a strong signal that Republicans would vote for the health bill, helping push it over the finish line in the absence of progressive DFL votes.
Emilia Gonzalez Avalos, executive director of Unidos Minnesota, said that working immigrants in Minnesota have been used as human shields in Minnesota legislative leaders’ budget deal.
“This is not an issue that will magically go away at the end of session. A countdown has begun, and people that were receiving treatments for life-saving procedures now have through the end of the year,” Gonzalez Avalos said.
House Speaker Lisa Demuth, R-Cold Spring, said the compromise leaders came to isn’t heartless.
“It’s not a measure of being uncaring. It’s a fiscal issue, and there are still opportunities those Minnesotans that are here illegally can still join the private market,” Demuth said.
There’s still a lot we still don’t know
The budget agreement gives the topline numbers for spending increases and cuts by agency.
The biggest cuts over the next two years are to human services ($270 million), transportation ($115 million), and health ($98 million).
The agreement doesn’t specify how, exactly, those agencies will make the changes to revenue and spending.
For example, the budget agreement calls for $270 million in cuts to the Department of Human Services.
In the House, lawmakers want to shift costs to counties and reduce the number of people receiving extra payments to cover care for people with extraordinary needs. In the Senate, the DFL majority passed a bill that would instead cut funding to nursing homes. And Walz has his own ideas for how to slow down DHS spending.
It’s not clear what aspects of each plan — House, Senate and governor — were incorporated into the agreement. In a press conference Thursday, no one mentioned the specifics of the DHS portion of the bill.
Leaders did discuss how they plan to achieve some of the savings: ending MinnesotaCare for undocumented adults; repealing one part of a tax credit for data centers; and pushing some costs to counties.
Details of the budget cuts will trickle out as lawmakers meet in conference committees, taking aspects of the House and Senate versions of budget bills until they reach the target handed down to them by leadership.
Looming over the process is the expected cuts from the Republicans in Washington.
If Congress moves forward with a federal budget that would slash funding to states — which would likely happen in September just before federal government funding expires — lawmakers would have to reconvene to find even more cuts.
Stillwater prison to close in 2029
The budget agreement includes the closure of the state’s second-largest prison, in Stillwater.
The 111-year-old facility has a massive backlog of maintenance needs. The prison has issues with leaking, flooding, dangerously hot interior temperatures, and structural deterioration, according to a recent report on the crisis caused by a lack of resources in Minnesota prisons.
“Minnesota Correctional Facility-Stillwater needs such significant updating and investments that closing the facility must be seriously considered,” the Office of the Ombuds for Corrections wrote in the report.
The facility’s 1,100 residents must be relocated over the next four years, assuming the Legislature moves forward with the plan.
Soft cuts
There are some areas of the state budget — including education and some parts of DHS — that automatically increase each year to account for inflation.
In the areas of the budget where inflation adjustments aren’t automatic, however, lawmakers are opting not to give agencies a funding bump to cover their expected cost increases over the next two years.
That means widespread smaller cuts, beyond those specified in the targets, are expected at state agencies, as the cost of providing services — labor, supplies, transportation, etc. — increase with inflation, while the agency’s budget does not.
Demuth during the budget announcement highlighted a small change to paid leave that would “reduce the tax for businesses.” But the change would only reduce the payroll tax cap that the Department of Employment and Economic Development could implement each year from 1.2% to 1.1%.
DEED has said it would launch the program in January with a 0.88% payroll tax, which will be split between workers and their employer.
Education cuts down the road? 
The budget agreement calls for no changes to education funding, except the mandatory inflation adjustment, over the next two years.
In the following two years, 2028 and 2029, the agreement calls for $420 million in cuts, which accounts for nearly a quarter of the savings projected in those years.
But the people who signed the agreement may not have the political power or will to follow through with those cuts. They would need to be approved by the 2027 Legislature. By 2027, Minnesota will have elected an entirely new House, Senate and governor.

The post Spending push interrupted by executive branch hiring freeze appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","WHILE BEACON HILL Democrats press ahead with plans to significantly increase state spending, Gov. Maura Healey on Wednesday paused executive branch hiring due to what her office described as “widespread economic uncertainty at the national level and a tightening budget outlook.”Healey announced a “hiring freeze” will take effect May 27, blocking executive branch agencies and departments from bringing on most new employees for a period that could last several months. Exemptions will be available for some positions such as public safety officers and direct care providers.Unlike the “hiring controls” the administration implemented for more than five months last year, the new policy will not offer a waiver process for agencies to request permission to onboard new workers.The governor’s office said the freeze will help insulate against “further anticipated federal funding cuts and spending pressures created by ongoing inflation and demand for services.”Massachusetts has had more than $350 million in federal funding cut so far by the Trump administration, according to a dashboard Healey’s team rolled out less than an hour after Healey announced the hiring pause.“The people of Massachusetts expect us to protect and maximize their tax dollars, and that’s exactly what we’re doing,” Healey said in a statement. “Tariffs and funding cuts from Washington are causing so much economic damage and instability. We are taking this step to prepare for more uncertain economic times, protect taxpayer dollars, and move our state forward while ensuring funding will be available for the vital services people need.”Budget-writers in Massachusetts are sweating the prospect of declining federal funding, especially to Medicaid, as Republicans in Congress advance a package of tax reform and spending cuts.Federal dollars play a key role in balancing the state’s spending plan. Healey’s budget expected federal reimbursements to increase to $16 billion in fiscal 2026, the vast majority of it for MassHealth.Any cuts to that total would force Beacon Hill to trim their own spending, scale back services for Bay Staters, or look to reserves or new tax policies to maintain spending.Administration and Finance Secretary Matthew Gorzkowicz said the hiring freeze “will give us added flexibility in the budget to respond and react to unforeseen program needs and other deficiencies that may arise.”“Our uncertain economic future in FY26 has been made less predictable by the threat of federal funding cuts and recent market upheaval,” Gorzkowicz said in a statement. “While we hope for the best, it is both prudent and responsible to be prepared and take control of what we can now.”Healey’s office said the administration will reevaluate the hiring freeze once the fiscal 2026 budget “has been signed and implementation is underway.” Lawmakers typically take until several weeks into the fiscal year that starts July 1 to complete their work on the budget.State tax collections with two months left in fiscal 2025 are running $2.7 billion or 7.8 percent above collections through the same stretch of fiscal 2024, and $1.9 billion or 5.5 percent above benchmarks. The surtax on high income households and capital gains tax revenues, two streams with limitations on how they can be used, are driving the growth. Gorzkowicz said Tuesday that non-surtax collections are “flat or slightly below benchmark.”Healey and top Democrats in the Legislature so far have opted not to revise their revenue collection forecasts for fiscal year 2026, including a tax revenue estimate crafted in January before Trump took office.The governor, the House and the Senate Ways and Means Committee all moved to increase state spending by between $3.6 billion and $4.2 billion next fiscal year, according to the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, growth fueled in part by a larger available pot of surtax dollars.Healey’s version of the bill featured a series of new taxes and tax increases, including a charitable donation cap and a tax on prescription drug manufacturers for excessive price increases, estimated to generate $471 million in revenue. The House dropped those provisions, leaving them ineligible for further consideration.Senators will begin debate next week on their chamber’s budget bill, which will hit the floor with a proposed 6.3 percent increase in spending over the plan Healey signed last summer. Lawmakers typically add to the budget’s bottom line during proceedings, mostly via local earmarks.A spokesperson for Senate President Karen Spilka declined to comment Wednesday on whether she still views that spending increase as prudent amid the new hiring freeze and warnings about economic uncertainty.House Speaker Ron Mariano’s office did not reply to a News Service inquiry on the topic.Senate Minority Leader Bruce Tarr described Healey’s move to freeze hiring as “a canary in the coal mine.”“Those concerns are understandable with all of the uncertainty we face, the potential for an economic downturn,” Tarr said in an interview. “I think those are things we need to consider as we move forward with the budget debate.”The Gloucester Republican said it might not be possible to reduce the size of the Senate budget bill before it hits the floor next week — amendments were due Friday — but he signaled he would be open to negotiators scaling back spending during the conference committee process.“It’s always a difficult situation when a conference committee … makes significant changes to bills that have been voted on by each branch,” he said. “But in the past, necessity has dictated that some conference committees have had to significantly reduce the amount of the budget, and we could be headed for one of those situations.”It’s the second straight year that Healey has imposed new limits on executive branch hiring. In April 2024, the administration implemented what officials at the time called “hiring controls” — not a “freeze” — that required Executive Office for Administration and Finance approval of new employees.The administration allowed those measures to expire on Nov. 1. In the roughly six-month span the controls were in place, executive branch agencies hired more than 2,000 employees, and officials said at the time that the limits saved about $21 million.[Alison Kuznitz contributed reporting.]The post Spending push interrupted by executive branch hiring freeze appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Gov.-Maura-Healey-right-and-Administration-and-Finance-Secretary-Matthew-Gorzkowicz-second-from-right-address-lawmakers-at-a-March-6-2025-hearing-about-their-fiscal-2026-budget-proposal.webp?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-15 18:09:37.656947

Gov. Ron DeSantis signed (SB 700) into law Thursday making Florida the second state (after Utah) in the country to ban municipalities from fluoridating their water supplies.
The bill doesn’t include the word fluoride. Instead, it references any substances not included on a list of acceptable additives — which fluoride is not.










The Florida Dental Association prioritizes the health and well-being of all Floridians and relies on research-proven methods to promote dental health across the state.


– FDA President Dr. Jeff Ottley 


But DeSantis dropped the F-word plenty during a bill-signing ceremony and credited State Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo with helping to get the ban passed.
“Joseph Ladapo has really led the charge by going to counties and saying forcing fluoride into your water is actually not good. There’s risks associated that. For pregnant women, for young people, for kids. And, yes, use fluoride for your team. That’s fine. But forcing it into the water supply is basically forced medication on people. They don’t have a choice. You’re taking that away from them,” the governor said.
Florida’s top public health official recommends nixing community water fluoridation

The Florida Dental Association denounced the move, saying in a prepared statement it was “disappointed in Governor DeSantis and the Florida Legislature’s decision to end one of the most effective, safe and affordable protections against tooth decay.”
“The Florida Dental Association prioritizes the health and well-being of all Floridians and relies on research-proven methods to promote dental health across the state,” FDA President Dr. Jeff Ottley said in a prepared statement.
Ottley went on to say that the FDA strongly reinforces that fluoridation is a naturally occurring mineral, not a medication, that is already present in the water in many parts of the country, including Florida. Water fluoridation has been researched for more than 80 years, and overwhelming, credible scientific evidence consistently indicates that fluoridation of community water supplies is safe and effective at preventing and repairing tooth decay.”
It’s the second press event the governor held on SB 700 in the last nine days. He was joined by Ladapo and Agriculture and Consumer Services Commissioner Wilton Simpson at the first event.
Simpson joined DeSantis again Thursday to praise the new law. Senate President Ben Albritton also attended the press conference.
Emergency fuel
Albritton championed a provision in SB 700 that creates Florida Retail Fuel Transfer Switch Modernization Grant Program within the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.
Subject to funding, the program provides up to $10,000 in grants per retail fuel facility to install or modernize transfer switch infrastructure to allow for the continuity of fueling operations when the stations are being powered by a generator.
Retail fuel locations in fiscally constrained counties could be awarded grants of up to $10,000. Gas stations in all other counties would be eligible for up to $5,000 in grants to cover the costs of the transfer switch and installation. The transfer switches must be capable of operating all fuel pumps.
Worth noting: The bill doesn’t contain an appropriation, so the grant program must be included in the state fiscal year 2025-26 budget in order to be operational.
Albritton predicted the grant program will be a game changer for Floridians during hurricane season, a time when power outages can leave residents locked out from filling their cars with gasoline, even when the stores have it available.
“So, when hurricane evacuation or when hurricane recovery is happening, those families will not have to search on, and on, and on, and on trying to find gasoline just to keep their family safe and get out of harm’s way. These switches will go a long way to making sure that we have generators that are connected to these places and will have access to that gasoline.”",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2024-OHSR-Thumbnail-for-Subpages-1024x576.png,,,2025-05-15 18:09:37.656947

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)The Utah Supreme Court has affirmed that death row inmate Douglas Stewart Carter’s conviction and sentence should be vacated, agreeing that his trial violated his constitutional right to due process. 
In a unanimous ruling issued Thursday, the state’s highest court agreed with a postconviction court’s earlier ruling that Utah County prosecutors violated Carter’s constitutional rights on multiple occasions — during both his trial and sentencing — and that he should be given a new trial. 
Carter was found guilty by a jury and sentenced to death in the 1985 murder of Eva Olsesen, who was found stabbed and shot in her Provo home in what police said was a home invasion. After that conviction was overturned, Carter was again found guilty and ordered to die in 1992.
The lower court’s post-conviction order came following a 2021 evidentiary hearing. The state and the Utah County Attorney’s Office appealed, arguing to the Utah Supreme Court that the lower court used an incorrect legal standard for the ruling. The Supreme Court’s five justices agreed with the state that the lower court used the wrong standard — but they said the judge still arrived at the correct outcome.

“It is important to note that, for the most part, the State does not challenge the court’s factual findings. Further, the State does not dispute that it wrongfully suppressed exculpatory evidence and that the prosecutor knowingly failed to correct at least one instance of false testimony,” Justice Paige Petersen wrote in the opinion. “Rather, the State argues that the postconviction court used an incorrect legal standard in part of its prejudice analysis, and that overall, these constitutional violations did not prejudice Carter under the applicable (Postconviction Remedies Act) standards.” 
Petersen wrote that justices “agree with the State that part of the postconviction court’s prejudice analysis relied on an incorrect legal standard.”
“However, applying the correct legal standard, there is no question that these numerous constitutional violations — suppressing evidence, suborning perjury, and knowingly failing to correct false testimony — prejudiced Carter at both his trial and sentencing,” she wrote. “We affirm.” 
Petersen added that the “constitutional violations that took place during Carter’s trial and resentencing are serious.”
She noted that two witnesses for prosecutors — Epifanio Tovar and his wife Lucia — “provided important testimony” to corroborate aspects of Carter’s confession. However, the lead investigator told Epifanio to “falsely deny receiving financial assistance from police and to falsely claim that Carter said he was going out to ‘rape’ someone on the night of the murder.”

“It is rare to see a case involving multiple instances of intentional misconduct by two different police officers — one of them the lead investigator on the case — and a prosecutor. But that is what the postconviction court found here,” Petersen wrote. “Two officers instructed important prosecution witnesses to lie not only about receiving benefits from the police, but also, in Epifanio’s case, to fabricate a statement intended to show that Carter harbored a premeditated intent to commit rape on the night of the murder.” 
Epifanio “went along with the coaching and perjured himself repeatedly,” Petersen added. “And the prosecutor stood by while Epifanio denied receiving any benefits, knowing the testimony was false, and did nothing to correct it.” 
The postconviction court vacated Carter’s conviction and sentence and ordered a new trial “because it determined these violations prejudiced Carter within the meaning of (the Postconviction Remedies Act),” Petersen concluded. 
“Its ‘confidence [was] undermined in both Carter’s conviction and sentence,’” Petersen quoted from the lower court’s ruling. “So is ours. We affirm.” 
Utah executes Taberon Honie by lethal injection, first capital punishment since 2010

A spokesperson for the Utah Attorney General’s Office issued a statement Thursday offering condolences to the murder victim’s family. 
“We extend our hearts and sympathies to the family of Eva Olesen, who have sought justice for her murder the last 40 years,” the Utah Attorney General’s Office spokesperson said. “We are disappointed the Olesen family does not yet have a resolution in this case.” 
Carter’s attorney, Eric Zuckerman, issued a statement expressing gratitude in the ruling but also saying the case highlights a need for reform to Utah’s “broken” capital punishment system. 
“Mr. Carter has spent more than forty years behind bars because of an unconstitutional conviction rooted in police and prosecutorial misconduct — including the suborning of perjury before a jury of his peers,” Zuckerman said. “We are gratified that both the trial court and the Utah Supreme Court have validated Mr. Carter’s claims. But no ruling can restore the four decades of freedom the State of Utah unjustly took from him. This decision underscores what has long been clear: Utah’s death penalty system is broken beyond repair.” 
It’s not yet clear what will come next for Carter’s case. 
Will Ralph Menzies’ dementia keep him from a firing squad? Attorneys make final argument

The Utah County Attorney’s Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday or say whether it would seek a new trial. 
The ruling comes as the courts weigh at least two other significant death row legal challenges. 
Carter is among a group of death row inmates that have appealed to the Utah Supreme Court after a lower court rejected a lawsuit alleging Utah’s death penalty methods of lethal injection and firing squad are cruel and unusual punishment. He and Ralph Menzies, Troy Kell, Michael Archuleta and the now deceased Taberon Honie joined the lawsuit. Honie was executed by lethal injection in August. 
Menzies is also awaiting a decision on his case, in which he and his attorneys have argued his dementia has advanced to the point that he can no longer form a “rational understanding” of why the state is pursuing the death penalty and he should be spared from being executed by firing squad. The Utah Attorney General’s Office argues that while Menzies may be impaired, he is still “clearly competent.”

(Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)A bill aiming to deregulate cryptocurrency mining in New Hampshire and forbid local officials and state agencies from placing limits on the practice was set for a final vote Thursday before state senators sent it back to committee to give supporters time to work on it and whip up more votes.
“I think the bill’s ready to go, but I understand we need more time to convince all of my colleagues,” Sen. Tim McGough, a Merrimack Republican and supporter of the bill, said on the Senate floor Thursday. “And we’ll take that time over the summer.”
If enacted, House Bill 639 would forbid New Hampshire state agencies and local officials from banning cryptocurrency mining in their city, town, or elsewhere in the state. Under this bill, they also couldn’t regulate cryptocurrency mining based on sound, electric use, or as an investment vehicle. They’d also be unable to prevent or impair people from using cryptocurrency to buy or sell goods and services.
McGough likened the current moment with cryptocurrency to the 1990s, when the internet was in its infancy and people were trying to understand it. He said he was “a little bit afraid” of some aspects of the internet, such as “putting all your personal information online.” However, he’s glad he listened to a friend who told him to adopt the internet.
“Can you imagine if we prohibited internet servers and data centers as we know them today,” he said. “Running powerful computers to solve equations that end in blockchain currency wealth will not end the world, will not be bad for our economy.”
Cryptocurrency mining is how people generate digital assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Dogecoin. Miners use high-energy supercomputers to attempt to solve a puzzle through trial and error and unlock the cryptocurrency from what is known as a blockchain. These virtual assets can be bought and sold for U.S. dollars or other currencies, making them lucrative. Proponents of crypto argue it could one day be used as a regular currency and some buyers and sellers have already adopted it in this way.
The bill was written using model legislation created by a crypto industry group called Satoshi Action Fund. Satoshi Action Fund also consulted with the Commission on Cryptocurrencies and Digital Assets, which provided lawmakers with policy recommendations. The group works to promote cryptocurrency nationwide and boasts on its website that its model legislation has been implemented in four states: Arkansas, Louisiana, Montana, and Oklahoma. 
The bill’s sponsor, Rep. Keith Ammon, a Goffstown Republican, has portrayed the bill as antidiscriminatory legislation, arguing cryptocurrency mining needed to be protected from moratoriums similar to those that have happened in other states. He’s also dismissed environmental concerns about the practice as misinformation.
Environmentalists opposed to this bill, including the New Hampshire Sierra Club and the National Coalition Against Cryptomining, are concerned about the carbon emissions these supercomputers are responsible for producing and their impact on the state’s electric grid. (The electrical energy consumption of one Bitcoin transaction is equivalent to what an average U.S. household over 45.60 days consumes, as of May 2025, according to one analysis done by a Dutch doctoral student.) 
They’re also concerned about the noise for neighbors of the facilities. Cryptocurrency mines in New York, Arkansas, and other states have generated uproar and noise complaints among their neighbors. Arkansas went so far as to repeal deregulatory legislation it passed that was very similar to this bill over these complaints, though that is now tied up in the courts. At least one New York community has put a moratorium on cryptocurrency mining.
Regulators, including with the state Bureau of Securities Regulation, are concerned that provisions in the bill to preclude cryptocurrency mining from being considered a security or investment contract are concerned it could hamper their ability to protect New Hampshire investors from bad actors falsely offering services.
If the Senate eventually passes the bill, Gov. Kelly Ayotte will decide whether to sign or veto the bill. She recently signed pro-cryptocurrency legislation into law when she approved House Bill 302, which allows the state treasurer to invest state funds in cryptocurrency and precious metals as an investment vehicle. She subsequently boasted on social media that New Hampshire was “First in the Nation” to do so. Still, in this law, the state treasurer is limited to placing 5% of state assets in Bitcoin and gold, and she is not required to do so but simply allowed to.
However, speaking to reporters last week, Ayotte said she was in favor of the cryptocurrency industry operating in New Hampshire, but she didn’t signal support for a completely self-regulated industry.
“Having opportunities for economic development with crypto, certainly we would welcome that,” she said. “But you have to have, obviously, guardrails in place, because we have had examples. Because it’s not regulated federally, there would have to be regulatory measures put in place to make sure that’s done responsibly, like we would with any kind of issue like this.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_3911-Full-Senate-1024x736.jpg,,,2025-05-15 17:17:09.163697

Gov Michelle Strinden presides over the session. (Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota U.S. Rep. Julie Fedorchak described Medicaid as an “at-risk program” unless reforms are adopted to curb rising costs.
But North Dakota advocates for Medicaid recipients said Thursday they worry about people slipping through the cracks and new administrative burdens being added to the state.
Fedorchak, a Republican member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, voted in favor of reforms to Medicaid during a meeting that ended Wednesday.
During a virtual press conference Thursday, Fedorchak said the overhaul will ensure the program remains solvent for people with disabilities, pregnant women, elderly people whom she said the program was designed for.
U.S. House panel passes GOP plan that cuts Medicaid by $625B, adds work requirement

“In my opinion, I don’t think this will result in fewer people receiving those benefits,” Fedorchak said. “It will result in the people who qualify for them receiving them.”
According to the Congressional Budget Office analysis, which was shared with States Newsroom, about 10.3 million people would lose access to Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with 7.6 million people becoming uninsured during the 10-year budget window.
Those receiving Medicaid benefits would need to submit to eligibility requirements twice per year. In addition, people without disabilities between ages 19 to 64 would be required to work, volunteer or attend school for 20 hours per week to retain their benefits, she said.
“This is a very important and humane requirement,” she said. “We want to help people become independent … this program should help encourage and incentivize able-bodied people to find a job, or be engaged with the community.”
The Medicaid work requirements will not apply to pregnant women, foster youth under age 26 and tribal members, Fedorchak said. Those considered “medically frail,” which include people who are blind or disabled, those with a substance-use disorder, or serious or complex medical conditions, would also be exempted from the work requirements.
The exemptions also extend to the parent, or caregiver, of a dependent child, those who are incarcerated or released from incarceration within 90 days, those impacted by natural disasters, or people living in counties with an unemployment rate greater than 8%, or an unemployment rate 150% higher than the national average.
“There’s a lot of very reasonable, I think, and appropriate exemptions included in this for folks who might not be able to reasonably meet these requirements,” she said.
Kirsten Dvorak, executive director of The Arc of North Dakota, an organization that promotes the rights of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, said she worries about people “falling through the cracks” because of the additional Medicaid requirements. She added she finds the inclusion of “able-bodied” in the bill text concerning.
“How do you define able-bodied?” Dvorak said. “Our disability community, through whatever means, is being attacked right now. And our community is nervous.”
Dvorak said many people with disabilities work in North Dakota communities, in some cases due to job coaching services that are funded through Medicaid.
She also questioned who was going to do the additional paperwork for the people with disabilities to continue receiving their services. Some members of the disabled community are under corporate guardianships because they don’t have anybody who can make decisions for them, she said.
About 108,000 North Dakota residents are eligible to receive Medicaid benefits as of April, including more than 54,000 people under age 21, according to data from the North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services.
No tax on tips, child tax credit and business tax cuts survive in big House GOP bill

LuWanna Lawrence, a spokesperson for HHS, said the department is in contact with Fedorchak and North Dakota’s congressional delegation about what the proposed legislation would mean to the state. 
“We are closely monitoring the budget process at the federal level. At this time, we cannot speculate on potential impacts,” Lawrence said in a statement. 
Verifying the work requirements and additional Medicaid eligibility requirements is likely to require more state workers to process the paperwork, said State Senate Minority Leader Kathy Hogan, D-Fargo, a member of the Senate Human Services Committee.
Hogan said she would not be surprised if state health officials approach the Legislature during the interim to request additional funding and staffing.
On the proposed work requirements, Hogan said many people receiving Medicaid benefits work in low-paying service jobs that do not offer health insurance. She questioned what would happen if a person worked 18 hours one week and 22 hours the next.
“Do you lose your benefit? It’s really complicated to document, particularly for lower-end workers,” she said. “The ability to actually implement these administrative responsibilities feels like a punishment for being poor.”

(Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — The group of Bryan High Bears left the auditorium feeling honored. Some had a newfound enthusiasm for the art of legal sparring, as their high school had just hosted a rare event featuring the highest judges in the state: the Nebraska Supreme Court.
Still, something hadn’t sat well with members of the school’s MLK Living the Dream Team club, which was part of the larger student group of about 60 that participated in the event.

Team members, noting they come from backgrounds disproportionately hurt by some Trump administration policies, said they felt dismissed at times by the justices and cited a response Justice William Cassel gave to a student’s question regarding increased conflict between the president and the courts. 
The question: Do you think we are in a constitutional crisis?
“Your expression seemed amused as if it were a silly question,” the MLK dream team subsequently wrote in a letter to Cassel that they said reflected a larger frustration beyond him. “To be fair, you did technically answer the question when you said, ‘We’re not even close,’ but we would like for you to explain how you came to that conclusion.”
 ‘Serious concerns’ 

While team members topped off their recent letter with appreciation for the “once in a lifetime experience” the Court’s April visit offered, they spent much of the two-page missive diving into recent deportations and executive orders they said raise “serious concerns about the safety and future of millions of first-generation kids from our community and beyond.”

Cassel promptly wrote back. In a three-paragraph reply, he encouraged the students to advocate for what they believe is right, but declined to “engage in a public debate regarding current affairs.”
A high court justice since 2012 and appointed by a Republican governor, Cassel wrote that it was not inconceivable that a case related to issues identified by the students could come before him and that it would be inappropriate to “form or express views” on the events they discussed.

Said Cassel: “I encourage you, as students, to continue to inform yourselves as these issues unfold, to seek out the lessons of history, to consider carefully the views expressed on all sides of controversial issues, to reach your own informed opinions and to advocate for what you believe is just and right.”
The exchange may be uncommon in the nine or so years that the state Supreme Court, on a few occasions each year, has taken its official business on the road. As they did at Bryan in April, the justices hear oral arguments at a select few high schools and at least one university annually and afterward answer questions from students. 
The idea, said State Court Administrator Corey Steel, is to showcase the court system and judicial branch — and from what he has witnessed, most students who follow up have done so with a thank-you note.
But these are different times, as noted by the Bryan MLK dream team members. The group’s letter said that days after the Nebraska justices visited their school, the Trump administration “blatantly disregarded a clearcut 9-0 Supreme Court ruling pertaining to the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia.”
“This has never happened before in the history of the United States,” wrote the team, whose half-dozen members meet weekly to talk about social justice issues and prepare for an annual speech and essay contest held on the January holiday honoring Martin Luther King Jr. 
Students said they enjoyed hearing the state justices during the April traveling court session. They were thankful for their insight but had hoped their own voices would be “heard and validated” by their state’s top legal minds. They asked Cassel to please elaborate on his stance.
The justices did not elaborate, either, when the Examiner sought a response to the letter. Judges in general are cautious with public comments, given judicial codes of conduct that discourage statements that could affect the outcome or impair the fairness of an impending case or court matter. 
 Sparking interest in law

In the end, the Supreme Court visit appears to have succeeded in achieving an intended goal of the traveling court events, as stated by Steel: “raise interest in the process and spark some students to look at getting involved in the legal field in Nebraska.”

He points out that the number of lawyers has been declining in rural parts of Nebraska, where the Supreme Court also tries to meet once a year to interact with high school students and allow them front-row seats to court activities.
At Bryan, which is part of the more urban Omaha Public Schools district, junior Gabriela Moran-Zinzun noted the lack of racial and ethnic diversity she saw on the state’s seven-member Supreme Court — and said she plans to pursue a law degree. 
Andrea Chaparro, also 16 and of Hispanic heritage, said she is pulled to journalism and political science. Both asked questions of the justices during a student-focused Q-and-A session that followed arguments on an official case the students watched play out in their school auditorium.
They and classmate Kameron Lloyd, all members of the MLK club, were part of that larger Bryan audience that also included history and government classes. The club members said they decided to write the letter after mulling some emotions stirred by the Court’s visit. 
Lloyd, 17, reflected on a national day of protest recently when many immigrants and their allies, in reaction to federal immigration policies, did not report to work or school. He said some schoolmates doubted the protest would have any impact and said he sensed a fear to speak out. 
“I‘m hoping this letter will inspire them to do otherwise,” Lloyd said. “Their voices do have power.”

Around the same time, the Trump administration moved to cancel visas for a wave of foreign-born students studying in the U.S., including three at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Many of the visas have since been restored, including those at UNL, but threat remains as the government has started work on a new system for review and termination.
Lloyd said that while the May 2 MLK letter was built on one justice’s response to one question, the dream team’s concerns are bigger than the letter, their club or the high court.
The MLK team members wrote from a perspective of a high school that is predominately Latino. They spoke of the right to “due process” and trauma many have witnessed in their community. 
“While you might not have a direct personal connection to these realities, we would still urge you to make the attempt to empathize with immigrant communities who are living in a state of fear, due in large part to what we view to be an obvious series of constitutional crises,” their letter said.
 A hoodie and a Chicago Bulls hat

Chaparro said pressure and fear have kept many older generations of immigrants quiet, and that motivates her to ask more questions, seek information and respectfully question authority.
“It starts to spark something that we need to speak out,” she said, “and that it’s not something we should be afraid of.”
Said Moran-Zinzun: “There’s always been kind of like a dark cloud around us, the idea that we in our community can’t really trust the government or law enforcement. That’s why it’s so important for us as the youth to be able to know what’s going on … to create a connection between us and the government.” 
The club’s letter cited recent deportations of foreign-born people from the U.S. and Trump executive orders, including one designed to alter birthright citizenship. It said such actions had many questioning the legality of certain administration edicts and actions. 
The students wrote that Garcia, for example, was in the country with U.S. permission, given temporary protected status after a judge determined he’d face danger returning to El Salvador. They said like anyone on U.S. soil, he should have had the right to a fair and speedy trial.











It starts to spark something that we need to speak out — and that it’s not something we should be afraid of.


– Andrea Chaparro, Bryan High student



The Trump administration has said its actions are justified by labeling Garcia a foreign terrorist, security threat and member of the MS-13 gang. The students said the case against the father of three children married to an American citizen and with no criminal conviction in the U.S. was built largely upon “a hoodie and a Chicago Bulls hat.”
“Deporting Abrego Garcia sets a dangerous precedent that would potentially make any Latino person wearing a Bulls hat into a target for being profiled and deported at any time,” the letter said.

During the Nebraska Supreme Court’s April visit to Bryan, Cassel stepped up to offer thoughts when a student asked the entire court whether the nation was in a constitutional crisis. 
Cassel suggested at the time that students google President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s “court-packing plan,” and said: “We aren’t even close.”
During the event, other students walked up to a microphone and queried the Court on various matters, including on whether the justices feared for their jobs, given that the president called for the removal of a judge who had ruled against his deportation plans.
Chief Justice Jeffrey Funke at that point delved into the differences between Nebraska’s method of appointing and removing judges versus that of the federal government. He’d later tell a reporter that road trips such as the one to Bryan help justices reset, and positions them to hear from Nebraskans in the “every day world.”
 Feeling ‘seen’ 

MLK club members Moran-Zinzun, Chaparro and Lloyd said in a recent interview that they remain honored their school was selected to host the Supreme Court session. They said they learned and appreciated that justices took time for questions and photos afterward.

“I think the reason we felt comfortable sending the letter is because they made the first move to come and took the initiative to come to our school and to try to build a connection between students and the Supreme Court,” said Moran-Zinzun.
Lloyd said he felt the original question posed to justices remained unanswered. But students were happy Cassel took time to reply to the club’s letter.
“Just an overall response made us feel seen, and that writing the letter made a point,” said Chaparro.
Nick Clawson, the Bryan teacher and sponsor of the MLK club, said he was proud of the students, for facing the often “scary situation” of public speaking at the initial Supreme Court event and for having courage to go a step further by sharing their feelings in the letter.
“This is what civil discourse looks like,” he said, noting the Court’s stated purpose to inspire students. “To truly spark interest sometimes involves tension and even conflict, and that’s something that MLK himself often did.”
Of the club, he said: “They’re truly living MLK’s dream through this by being a voice for the voiceless.”

Several Upper Valley schools were among those scheduled, and administrators for some of those schools had said this month they were counting on state support.“If (schools) want to move forward with the sampling, they can conduct it on their own,” Coppolino said in an interview on Tuesday. There remains a possibility that the state would reimburse school districts for testing expenses at some point in the future. “That’s our plan,” Coppolino said.When the state mandated PCB testing in 2021, it said air testing was expected to cost about $20,000 per school.

File photo by Anne Wallace Allen/VTDiggerIn the meantime, the state will prioritize financial support for six school districts, including Hartford, that have already tested and discovered PCB contamination levels that are well above state-established safety levels.The state’s Department of Environmental Conservation has requested $9.5 million from the Legislature to assist those six schools. Lawmakers are still negotiating the budget. Even that funding — if approved — is on a “first-come, first-served” basis and won’t cover all costs, Coppolino said.Hartford school officials were scheduled to meet with state officials this week to discuss a plan of action to address highly elevated PCB levels at Hartford High School and Hartford Career and Technical Center. The contamination is so bad, Hartford officials have been considering demolishing and rebuilding portions of the schools.PCBs were used in building materials from the 1930s through the 1970s until they were banned by the Environmental Protection Agency in 1979. Exposure to PCBs can lead to health issues with the nervous, immune, reproductive and endocrine systems, according to a fact sheet from the Vermont Department of Health. The International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified PCBs as carcinogens.In 2021, the Vermont Legislature passed Act 74, which mandated school districts test the air quality of educational buildings for PCB contamination. The original deadline to complete the testing was this year, but that date has since been pushed to 2027.The state testing schedule was last updated on April 3.Despite not having money to reimburse local school districts, state officials decided to leave the schedule in place, Coppolino said. “I think it’s uncertain when funding is going to be provided for the next phase of schools and the work that needs to happen,” she said.According to the Department of Environmental Conservation website, testing scheduled for 2025 and beyond, “will occur in scheduled order as funding becomes available. …. The Agency will work to reimburse school funded work when additional funding becomes available.”The Vermont Superintendents Association is adamant that the state should pay for PCB testing and that the funding allocated so far has been insufficient to pay for testing and resulting remediation work.“It is up to the Agency of Natural Resources, not VSA, to clearly communicate with superintendents that testing has been suspended, what the implications for that are, and next steps,” Chelsea Myers, executive director of the Montpelier-based nonprofit organization, wrote in a Wednesday email. “We continue to hold the position that this state-mandated initiative should be paid for by the state, not local school districts.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  State has no money to assist with PCB testing in Vermont schools this year.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Hartford-Area-Career-and-Technical-Center.jpg,,,2025-05-15 17:17:09.163697

(Amy Dalrymple/North Dakota Monitor)Greenpeace wants a North Dakota judge to reduce the nearly $667 million in damages it was ordered to pay the developer of the Dakota Access Pipeline in March, arguing that the award is excessive and unreasonable.
A Morton County jury handed down the sum following a more than three-week trial earlier this year. Jurors found the environmental group at fault for damages related to protests against the pipeline in North Dakota in 2016 and 2017, and for publishing defamatory statements that harmed Energy Transfer’s business. 
Greenpeace was one of many activist groups that backed the movement, which drew thousands to rural south-central North Dakota to protest in solidarity with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe.
Greenpeace denies Energy Transfer’s allegations and says the company only brought the lawsuit to chill environmental activism. The defendants have yet to appeal.
In the meantime, attorneys for Greenpeace have asked Southwest Judicial District Judge James Gion to slash the nearly $667 million award, claiming it exceeds statutory caps on damages and that the verdict is riddled with inconsistencies.
“This is the poster child of where the court needs to step in,” Steven Caplow, an attorney representing Greenpeace, said in a Thursday morning remote hearing.
Jury finds Greenpeace at fault for protest damages, awards pipeline developer more than $660 million

Energy Transfer says Gion should let the jury’s award stand. Trey Cox, an attorney representing the pipeline developer, called the damages “consistent with the evidence produced at trial and the law of the state of North Dakota.”
In North Dakota, a punitive damage award cannot exceed two times the compensatory damage award, or the amount granted to make up for financial losses a party suffered.
Greenpeace and Energy Transfer disagree as to whether the verdict meets this requirement. Caplow argued that the punitive damages must be reduced by roughly $43 million to be consistent with state law, while Cox said the damages don’t exceed the cap and ought to be left in place.
Greenpeace also claims the award includes costs that should actually be attributed to Energy Transfer or other third parties. Greenpeace maintains it only had six employees visit the protest camps, and that its presence was small compared to the many other activist groups that supported the movement. 
Caplow argued that Energy Transfer without sufficient evidence is holding Greenpeace responsible for all damages the company incurred in connection to the protests. He said the award unfairly compensates Energy Transfer for expenses it sustained before any Greenpeace employees set foot in North Dakota, for example.
Greenpeace also alleges the jury form — which the jurors had to fill out to issue their verdict — was flawed in a way that inflated the damages attributed to the environmental group.
Before the jurors deliberated, Gion directed them to consider whether each damage Energy Transfer claimed was directly caused by Greenpeace, or whether and to what extent they resulted from the actions of another group. Despite this being part of the instructions, there wasn’t space on the form for the jury to conduct this analysis, Caplow said.
 
More Dakota Access Pipeline coverage


That meant jurors were deprived of an opportunity to voice whether they believe Energy Transfer or other groups shared responsibility for any of the $667 million award, Caplow argued. 
Cox said Greenpeace could have proposed changes to the form to address this issue, but didn’t.
Greenpeace also asked Gion to remove hundreds of millions of dollars of defamation-related damages, claiming the award is not supported by the evidence presented at trial. The jury awarded Energy Transfer damages for statements Greenpeace published about the pipeline between November 2016 and June 2018.
The environmental group maintains that none of the statements are defamatory, but also says that even if they were, they cannot be held solely responsible for defamation. Greenpeace says the statements originated with other sources — including the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe — and were circulated by hundreds of other outlets well before it published anything about the pipeline.
Additionally, Greenpeace says a significant portion of the $667 million includes compensation for damages Energy Transfer did not formally request relief for, including some Greenpeace says the company referenced during trial but didn’t claim in its written complaint.
Energy Transfer disputes the notion that Gion has discretion to reduce the jury’s award.
Energy Transfer’s lawsuit is against three Greenpeace entities — Greenpeace USA, Greenpeace International and Greenpeace Fund. Greenpeace USA was found at fault for most of the claims brought by Energy Transfer. The jury did not find Greenpeace International and Greenpeace Fund responsible for on-the-ground harms committed by protesters, though it did find those entities responsible for defamation and interfering with Energy Transfer’s business. Additionally, the jury found Greenpeace USA and Greenpeace International liable for conspiracy.
Matt Kelly, an attorney representing Greenpeace Fund, said during Thursday’s hearing that the award against the organization should be tossed out. The jury ordered Greenpeace Fund to pay roughly $130 million despite the fact that it did not find the organization at fault for most of the major claims in the case, Kelly said.
“We were forced to litigate for seven years on claims where there was no basis for any liability against Greenpeace Fund,” Kelly said during the hearing. “The idea that we should be forced to bear those costs, at this point, is ridiculous.”
Greenpeace International in court filings argued similarly that the nearly $132 million in damages it was ordered to pay should be dropped.
Energy Transfer says that the awards are valid because the jury found both of the organizations at fault for interfering with the company’s business. 
Gion took the motion under advisement. Greenpeace in separate motions has asked Gion to fully reverse the jury’s verdict. The parties are scheduled to reconvene for another hearing on May 27. 
Greenpeace USA has announced its intent to appeal the verdict to the North Dakota Supreme Court.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)SIOUX FALLS — A constitutional amendment that South Dakota voters will consider in next year’s general election will strengthen rather than weaken the influence of out-of-state organizations in state politics, opponents of the amendment said Thursday.
Lawmakers approved a resolution this winter asking voters to increase the threshold for approving a constitutional amendment ballot measure from a simple majority to 60%. The question will be posed as Constitutional Amendment L.
Opponents launched a “No on L” campaign Thursday. Matthew Schweich, president of the Voter Defense Association, said the amendment would ensure the “tyranny of the minority” in the state.
Sioux Falls Republican Rep. John Hughes introduced the resolution. He told South Dakota Searchlight that the amendment would protect the state’s constitution from being amended by outside interests and prevent policy from being inserted into a document that’s intended only to stipulate the structure and powers of the government.
“Political issues shouldn’t be injected into the constitution,” Hughes said, adding “we’ve discovered it’s problematic and should be made more difficult.”

Hughes said an influx of constitutional amendments in recent years, including four last year (among seven total ballot questions), resulted in voter fatigue and groups bringing in “out-of-state money by the truckloads to convince people to do things ultimately against their best interests.” He specifically mentioned a 2022 amendment to expand Medicaid in the state, which passed with 56% of the vote, and a 2024 amendment to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution, which failed with 61% of votes against it.
Amendment L wouldn’t change campaign finance laws to directly address out-of-state influence, Schweich said Thursday. Instead, he said, the amendment would make it more difficult for grassroots movements to succeed.
Schweich has worked on several ballot measure campaigns in recent years, most recently on a failed measure to legalize recreational marijuana in the state.
“If Amendment L takes effect and constitutional amendments require 60%, the only people who will be able to attempt them are big money, out-of-state groups, because they will have the resources to run all of the ads necessary to hit 60%,” Schweich said.
Similar measures in 2018 and 2022 proposing to increase the voter threshold for constitutional amendments failed at the ballot box. 
Passing constitutional amendments is already difficult, Schweich said. South Dakotans have passed nearly half of the 100 constitutional amendments placed on the ballot since 1972, when South Dakotans gained the right to initiate them, according to a report from the No on L campaign.
If Amendment L were to have taken effect in 1972, only 20% of amendments would have crossed the 60% threshold since then, according to the report.
Lawmaker assertions about voter fatigue don’t stop them from sending four measures to the ballot

That includes several amendments related to gambling in the state and 2012’s Amendment O, which requires a balanced state budget each legislative session. The law passed with a 57% vote.
The 60% threshold would also have prevented Medicaid expansion, Hughes said, which currently has South Dakota on the hook for an “unfunded mandate” to cover millions of dollars of costs if the federal government reduces its share of Medicaid expansion funding.
“It’s a constitutional train wreck,” Hughes said. “The people who are pushing this agenda are unhappy with the views of a majority of South Dakotans, so they’re trying to manipulate people to change our culture and our core values.”
Supporters of the resolution during the legislative session included representatives with the National Rifle Association, South Dakota Right to Life, Protecting South Dakota Kids, South Dakota Retailers Association and South Dakota Family Voice Action.
Lawmakers endorsed three more constitutional amendments this winter that will be on next year’s ballot, including a clarification that non-U.S. citizens can’t vote in South Dakota elections, the creation of an unclaimed property trust fund, and a question to allow the Legislature to remove South Dakota from expanded Medicaid if the federal funding share declines.
Another six potential ballot questions from the public are already listed on the Secretary of State’s website. Two of those questions have been approved for petition circulation.

(Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)The New Mexico Supreme Court on Thursday ruled unanimously that criminal defendants are not entitled to visa applications from their alleged victims who are seeking protections from deportations as part of their testimonies.
So-called U and T visas allow non-citizen crime victims to report crimes and testify against perpetrators without fear of being deported. Approved visas allow victims temporary stays in the United States and also a potential avenue to lawful permanent resident status.
Last year, the court ordered judges in San Juan and Bernalillo counties to return or destroy victim visa application material that prosecutors had previously provided to defense teams. The court’s new ruling in an opinion issued today provides the legal reasoning for that order.
Local DA says immigrant crime victims are going silent amid deportation fears, letting abusers free

A rule requiring prosecutors to provide applications to defense teams could have a “chilling effect” on “immigrants’ willingness to report crimes,” the court’s opinion, written by Justice Shannon Bacon, said.
First Judicial District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies recently told Source New Mexico that some immigrant crime victims have stopped answering her phone calls, potentially out of fear of being deported despite qualifying for U visas. About 25 alleged crime victims applied for the visa in her judicial district in the first two months of 2025.
One woman who stopped participating in the criminal justice process accused her partner, a United States citizen, of abusing her and two kids, both under age 11 and citizens themselves, Carmack-Altwies said in February.
While the court rules that visa applications are now confidential and protected against disclosure during discovery, there are instances when information in an application must be turned over.
For example, if the prosecution knows that a victim has applied for a U visa, they should turn that over to the defense team, “because the fact of a U/T-Visa application is relevant impeachment material,” the court wrote.
A crime victim’s credibility could reasonably be called into question, according to the court, because the benefits of a U or T visa are “significant and could provide ulterior motives.”
The court explained that “the defense may impeach the victim’s credibility by cross-examining the victim about the potential benefits that a U/T-Visa offers to a victim, acknowledging these benefits are significant and could provide ulterior motives.”

When the U/T-visa application is relevant to the victim’s motive, the court wrote, a defendant can:
Cross-examine witnesses, including victims, regarding their knowledge and participation in the U/T-Visa application process and their reasons for involvement;
impeach a witness who has made “prior inconsistent statements on the topic”;
educate the jury about what U/T visa is and their benefits by cross-examining the state’s witnesses or direct examination of defense witnesses”;
and make related closing arguments

Also, if prosecutors have a copy of the visa application and material within it bears on the defendant’s guilt, then the information — “not the application” itself — must be disclosed, according to the court opinion. If the prosecution and defense disagree on whether information in the application is material, a judge may have to review it in private.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/20231120_085737-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-15 17:17:09.163697

With just over two weeks to go before their spring adjournment, lawmakers in Springfield are facing a tight deadline to pass major reforms to Chicagoland’s transit system — but officials have released few concrete details of the plan they say is taking shape.

Influential lawmakers said one major element will be addressed: safety.

“We need to make sure that there are safety mechanisms that are implemented by transit security, that there are transit ambassadors for customer service and nonviolent situations, and there are social services for those that are in need of mental and behavioral health services,” Senate Transportation Committee Chair Ram Villivalam, D-Chicago, said at a Thursday news conference.

Villivalam said transit safety reform should be rooted in data and “law enforcement expertise.” He cited the Los Angeles transit system, which he said has a similar number of riders as Chicago-area transit.

“We can look at their system and say these are how many officers they have, these are how many transit ambassadors they have and so forth,” Villivalam said.

Villivalam made the announcement alongside Rep. Marcus Evans, D-Chicago, a high-ranking House Democrat. Earlier this year, the two sponsored a transit reform proposal backed by more than 30 labor organizations. That bill outlined the creation of a new police force overseen by the Regional Transportation Authority.

“There’s no police presence. It makes no sense,” Evans said of the current Chicago transit landscape. “Across the world, not just this country: New York City? Dedicated police. Washington, D.C.? Dedicated police. Boston? Dedicated police presence. London? Dedicated police presence. Germany? Dedicated police presence.”

No final agreement has been reached for the expected reform bill. A spokesperson from the Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition, one of the advocacy groups involved in the transit negotiations, said that discussions dealing with public safety were scheduled for Thursday.

Late last month, two other lawmakers involved in the transit reform negotiations said Springfield insiders were nearing a deal that would resemble the labor-backed bill.

But that proposal doesn’t include a plan for funding the beleaguered Chicago-area agencies. While lawmakers have repeatedly stressed they are going to pass reforms before providing transit agencies new funding, agency heads and activists have consistently asked for financial support.

House Speaker Emanuel “Chris” Welch, D-Hillside, speaking to Capitol News Illinois on Thursday, didn’t commit to any details of the reform package, but did echo the need for safety reforms

“We have to have reforms before we even talk about revenue. We have to improve the ridership experience,” Welch said. “We have to improve rider safety. We have to improve safety for the employees on these trains and on these buses.”

Welch also pointed to a group of House lawmakers he convened who are “getting close on agreements.”

Chicagoland transit agencies — Chicago Transit Authority, Pace Suburban Bus, Metra commuter rail service and the RTA oversight agency — face a collective $770 million budget shortfall beginning this summer.

The RTA says that unless the state steps in with funding help, that budget gap will grow even as the transit agencies will have to make massive cuts to service in the region.

But that funding might not come from the state.

Villivalam said Thursday that conversations are continuing around how to handle the issue and declined to provide specifics. Instead, he pointed to past proposals from the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning and RTA without indicating what options, if any, lawmakers will adopt.

The three international students and one international-student graduate are suing Homeland Security for revoking their status as students – a step they fear could lead to them being detained and deported.
U.S. District Court Judge Rebecca Goodgame Ebinger previously issued a short-term temporary restraining order barring Homeland Security from deporting the four, and on Thursday she provided the additional protection of a preliminary injunction that will last while the plaintiffs’ underlying case against the government is being litigated.

Named as defendants in the case are Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, of which Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, is a part. Also named as a defendant is Acting Director of ICE Todd Lyons.
In Thursday’s decision, Judge Ebinger addressed Homeland Security’s claim that the students had wrongly interpreted a change in their student status in the federal database called the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System, or SEVIS. The agency had argued that the status listing was essentially meaningless “data” that had no actual impact on the students’ visas or status.
Ebinger rejected that claim, ruling that “SEVIS status is not meaningless and distinct from actual status.” She noted that Homeland Security itself had well-established record of equating a student’s SEVIS status with the student’s actual status, and that educational institutions, including the University of Iowa, rely on the SEVIS records to accurately determine a student’s status.
“Immediate consequences flow from reliance by Homeland Security, the Department of State, employers, and academic institutions on SEVIS records as proof of student status,” Ebinger stated in her ruling. “The alleged unlawful termination of student status through termination in SEVIS records eliminates or substantially hinders the ability to study, graduate, work, obtain reinstatement of status, alter status, or secure future immigration benefits.”
In addition, Ebinger rejected Homeland Security’s claim that its actions were not arbitrary and capricious – the standard for reversing administrative action, which is what the four UI plaintiffs seek as part of their lawsuit. The judge noted there was “no suggestion” made by anyone that the four plaintiffs met Homeland Security’s own standards for revoking student status, such as conveying falsehoods to Homeland Security, engaging in unauthorized employment, committing a serious crime or failing to engage in educational studies.
In deciding to issue the injunction, Ebinger also stated that she had “little confidence” that going forward, Homeland Security and ICE will comply with the law and “act consistently with pertinent regulatory factors.”
In a statement that underscores the difficulty lawyers for Homeland Security are likely to face as the underlying case moves forward, Ebinger stated in her decision that “imposing immediate negative consequences on persons while disregarding governing law and regulations is arbitrary and capricious.” The four UI plaintiffs, she said, “have demonstrated a strong likelihood of success on the merits” of their case.
Thursday’s injunction bars Noem, Homeland Security and ICE from initiating or ordering the arrest, detention, or transfer of the four plaintiffs — Prasoon Kumar, Songli Cai, Haoran Yang, and Sri Chaitanya Krishna Akondy — out of the court’s jurisdiction without first providing adequate notice to the court so the plaintiffs’ counsel can contest any such action.

Family and community supporters celebrated as the first detained migrant farmworker was released on bail Thursday morning after weeks in federal custody.

Photo by Auditi Guha/VTDiggerA fourth Vermont farmworker, out of the nine detained by U.S. Customs and Border Protection last month, was deported to Mexico this week, according to Burlington-based advocacy group Migrant Justice. Juan Javier Rodriguez-Gomez, 41, could not be found in the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement database on Thursday morning.“We’ll know more once he makes contact on his arrival to Mexico,” Will Lambek, spokesperson for Migrant Justice, wrote in an email. Five migrant farm workers remain in ICE custody, including four who were transferred to a detention facility in Texas last week. A Massachusetts immigration court granted one of them release on bail Thursday morning.The deported worker, Rodriguez-Gomez, was previously held at the Alexandria Staging Facility in Louisiana. In early May, three other farmworkers were deported from this facility, all under the same “expedited removal” procedure, according to a Thursday press release from Migrant Justice. Brett Stokes, attorney for the Center for Justice Reform at the Vermont Law and Graduate School, has said that type of deportation is almost impossible to challenge.The four deported men were among eight detained on April 21 at Pleasant Valley Farms, Vermont’s largest dairy, located a few miles from the Canadian border. Another farmworker, Arbey Lopez-Lopez, 36, was previously detained on the road to the farm while delivering groceries to workers almost two weeks earlier.Diblaim Maximo Sargento-Morales, a 30-year-old known as Max, could return to his home in Vermont as early as Thursday, according to Lambek. Vermont Freedom Bail Fund, an organization that raises funds to support migrant detainees, plans to pay for his bond release. The $1,500 bond is the lowest possible amount, according to Migrant Justice. READ MORE
Supporters are still determining how to pay for his flight, Lambek said, adding that Sargento-Morales will remain in Vermont while ICE officials push forward a case to deport him to Mexico.The geography of these remaining cases is complex. Sargento-Morales was one of four farmworkers transferred to the Karnes County Immigration Processing Center in Karnes City, Texas, on May 8. But his bond hearing happened at an immigration court in Chelmsford, Massachusetts, which has jurisdiction over the prison in Vermont, where he was held on May 7 when he applied for bond. The judge presiding over his case determined that her court still had jurisdiction over him while in Texas.READ MORE
But a different judge considering a second case in the same immigration court on Thursday  came to a different conclusion. In the case of Jose Edilberto Molina-Aguilar, 37, Judge Natalie Smith determined her court did not have jurisdiction over him after he was transferred to Texas. Stokes, his attorney, objected, but the judge upheld her opinion. Stokes must now file a bond motion with the Texas immigration court for Molina-Aguilar.“Justice delayed is justice denied,” Stokes said in a statement. He called Smith’s decision “an arbitrary and incorrect interpretation.” Lopez-Lopez, who is being detained in New Hampshire, had his hearing postponed. Smith said since she received materials related to Lopez-Lopez’s bond motion only on Wednesday, she was not prepared to reach a decision. She rescheduled the hearing for Monday at 1:30 p.m.“What happened today was procedural,” Lopez-Lopez’s attorney, Enrique Mesa, said in a statement. “We will return to court to continue the fight to reunite Arbey with his 5-year-old daughter and the community.”None of the three detainees who had hearings scheduled Thursday have formally applied for asylum, according to Lambek.Materials presented in the bond hearings included evidence that supports the farmworkers’ ties to their community and included a letter from almost 100 state elected officials, including Vermont’s lieutenant governor, the speaker of the House, and the Senate majority and minority leaders. The letter, dated May 7, was written in support of all nine men arrested in April, including the four who have since been deported.“We’re very pleased that Max will soon be released from immigration detention and will be back with his family and community in Vermont,” Lambek said following the hearings. “We’re very disappointed that the judge did not rule in bond hearings in two other cases, but we’re still optimistic that when those cases are finally heard that they’ll win their release as well.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  A 4th Vermont farmworker is believed to have been deported as another is released on bond.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/May-Day-2025-17-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-15 17:17:09.163697
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-15 20:58:51+00:00,CT Mirror,"CT Senate advances partial ban on ‘neonics,’ other pesticides",John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/15/ct-rat-poison-pesticide-ban/,A partial ban on rat poisons and other pesticides used in lawn care passed Thursday with changes sought by the pest control industry.,"A partial ban on rat poisons and other pesticides used in lawn care was advanced by the Connecticut Senate on Thursday, but only after the bill’s sponsors agreed to several changes sought by the pest control industry.
The legislation, Senate Bill 9, is the upper chamber’s preeminent environmental measure for the 2025 legislative session. In addition to curbing pesticides, the bill would order an update to the state’s water plan, require towns to consider sea level rise when making zoning changes and mandate flood risk disclosures for home buyers and renters, among other provisions.
Most of the attention, however, has focused on two provisions dealing with pest controls — specifically the use of certain long-acting rodenticides and a class of insecticides called neonicotinoids — which critics have spent years lobbying to ban in Connecticut.
While the bill would impose significantly greater restrictions on both of those chemicals, lawmakers passed an amendment on the Senate floor Thursday that offered some exemptions for the use of neonicotinoids — commonly referred to as ‘neonics’ — and delayed other restrictions on their use until 2027.
“The industry’s biggest concern is they said they were willing to help… if you give us a little time to acclimate and change our systems, we will be on board with this,” said Sen. Rick Lopes, D-New Britain, co-chair of the Environment Committee. “That’s the deal we cut with them.”
Still, the deal rankled environmental advocates, who have labeled neonicotinoids “the new DDT” due to their potential to harm birds, pollinators and other wildlife.
The Connecticut Audubon Society sent an email to its members prior to Thursday’s vote opposing the changes and urging lawmakers to restore the stricter language. Debate on the bill was briefly delayed as Democrats huddled to discuss some members’ concern with the new language. 
One of those in the huddle, state Sen. Christine Cohen, D-Guilford, was Lopes’ predecessor as chair of the Environmental Committee and had worked on several previous and unsuccessful efforts to ban neonicotinoids and rodenticides. 
“I’ve been on that side of the negotiations, and I know how difficult it can be,” Cohen said afterwards. “So despite my disappointment at not getting a full ban in both instances, I can appreciate their work, and I’m glad we’re at least moving in the right direction.”
Representatives of the Connecticut Pest Control Association and other industry groups did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the revised legislation Thursday. 
The legislation passed the Senate by vote of 28 to 8 after less than an hour of debate. It now heads to the House for further consideration.
Formal opposition to the bill came from a handful of Republicans, whose concerns focused on the bill’s partial ban on certain rat poisons that would limit their use to professionals certified by the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. Those restrictions are due to take effect on Jan. 1, 2026. 
Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, said he was worried some residents “would be forced to live with infestations of pests,” if they are unable to afford to hire a licensed specialist.
During Thursday’s debate, Lopes also objected to the characterization of the bill made by some of the supporters of stricter regulations. 
Lopes said he was asked by the pest control industry to include another carveout in the bill that would have allowed the application of pesticides on elementary school grounds. When he broached the idea with environmental groups, their objections prompted him to abandon the plan. But rumors continued to swirl about its inclusion in the final draft of the bill, he said.
“It was discussed briefly and then discarded,” Lopes said. “It has never been a part of the bill, it was just an idea at one point.”
Lopes said he did agree to include an exemption allowing for the application of neonicotinoids on shrubbery and other ornamental plants at the request of the industry. The bill would still ban the use of the pesticides on lawns and golf courses, which he said accounted for the majority of current applications in Connecticut.
“We targeted, like we target for emissions sometimes, the largest and worst-damaging aspect of the chemical,” Lopes said. “That should significantly decrease the amount of neonics exposed into our environment.”
Critics of the pesticides, however, said it made little sense to ban their use on grass while allowing it on other plants nearby that serve as natural habitats to birds, butterflies, bees and other species.
“It’s problematic because that’s where most of the blooms are, and the berries for the birds and the pollinators,” said Louise Washer, a Connecticut-based advocate with Pollinator Pathways. “On turf grass, there’s usually not as many flowering plants, so it’s not as attractive.”
Washer and other advocates said that while they were upset about the new exemptions, they still supported the overall bill and urged its passage in the House. 
Lopes said that the bill, including its climate provisions, is intended to run in tandem with House Bill 5004 as part of broader and long-awaited effort to bolster the state’s preparedness for climate change.
The House bill, which was approved by members of that chamber earlier this month, is intended to set Connecticut on a path toward achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NEONICS-SENATE-0515-SR-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-15 17:17:09.163697

Ned Lamont on Thursday that they were planning to strike if a negotiation over wages isn’t reached by May 27. 
Following a press conference, members of the union walked to Lamont’s office in the capitol on Thursday and delivered strike notifications to a member of his staff. They say it’s impossible to survive on the paltry $18.42 an hour that many are paid for work that is stressful and even dangerous.
Unless the groups reach an agreement, those 1,700 workers will join the 6,000 nursing home workers who have already pledged to strike, in what the union said would be the largest strike of health care workers in Connecticut history. Nursing home workers have demanded a pathway to increasing pay to $30 per hour and safe staffing levels.
Earlier this month, Lamont successfully delayed the strike deadline from May 19 to May 27 after meeting with nursing home and group home workers. Lamont said he “expressed to them that I agree that their current wages do not match the value of the service they provide and that I join them in their effort to seek an increase in their compensation.”
At the press conference on Thursday, Suzanne Clark, Secretary Treasurer of SEIU 1199NE, said that workers were being pushed to the brink at intense, low-wage jobs just to keep their families fed and housed.
“They’re working 60, 70, 80, frankly upward of 100 hours a week, just to get by. Not because they want to, but just to put food on the table, to pay rent,” Clark said.
Sylvia Grant, who works in a group home as direct support staff,  also took the podium to talk about her struggles over two decades. Though Grant said she felt called to a career as a caretaker, she can’t take care of her own family.

“I’m often left deciding if I’m buying food to put in the fridge, or am I paying car insurance. I’m always juggling bills — I should join the circus,” Grant said through tears. “There are decisions no one should have to make — especially a caregiver working full time. But here’s the catch: I’m working more than full time.”
Linnea Moore, a residential program worker, said that workplace injuries are common in group homes. 
“I’ve been hit, I’ve been kicked, I’ve had fire extinguishers thrown at me, I’ve had chairs thrown at me, I’ve had rocks thrown at me, I’ve been spit at,” Moore said. “We’ve had many, many, many injuries, and I think a lot of it is because we don’t have the proper staffing. But who wants to work for $18 an hour and get beat up?”
Gian-Carl Casa, the president and CEO of The Alliance, an advocacy organization that represents nonprofits, said that state contracts with nonprofits haven’t allowed those groups to pay workers enough, and low wages have also made it difficult to attract and retain employees.
“It would be an enormous hardship for those organizations if workers go on strike,” Casa said. “They value their workers, they want to pay them more, but like all nonprofits they just can’t do it financially unless the state provides increases.” 
Casa said that the state does have the ability to pay — thanks to a surplus of more than $2 billion, and that paying workers more would boost local economies. 
But questions remain about what proposed federal cuts to programs like SNAP and Medicaid would mean for Connecticut’s budget, and the many holes that surplus funding would be needed to fill. 
“If funding remains flat and federal funding is cut, it would be a human disaster,” Casa said. “Programs would close, people would lose their jobs, it would just be a mess.”

(Ole Miss athletics)
As an Ole Miss Rebel, he was the MVP of both the Gator and Sugar Bowls. As an NFL rookie, he intercepted eight passes and returned two for touchdowns. As a coach, he won two national championships and two Super Bowl rings. He played for coaching legends John Vaught and Paul Brown, coached with the legendary Tom Landry. He is a member of seven different halls of fame.
And all that doesn’t even begin to tell the story of Clarksdale native and Ole Miss great Bobby Ray Franklin, a gentleman and a winner, who died Wednesday in his adopted hometown of Senatobia. He was 88.
When writing the life story of Franklin, there’s just so much to cover. Where to begin? Let’s start with this: He was the son of a barber and was given the nickname “Waxie” because of all the butch wax he wore in his crew cut hair as a young man.

Rick Cleveland 
Says former Ole Miss Chancellor Robert Khayat, an Ole Miss teammate of Franklin’s and a friend for more than six decades, “From the time we stepped onto the campus in August of 1966, Waxie was the best athlete on our football team. He was a terrific quarterback and defensive back, but he was so much more than that. He was fast, he was smart, he was funny. He could run it, pass it, kick it, punt it, catch it and tackle whoever had the ball. He was a leader. There was nothing Bobby Ray Franklin couldn’t do. And everything he did, he did first class.”
Franklin was funny, indeed. One example: The 1959 Ole Miss team was one of the greatest in college football history, out-scoring opponents 349-21 in 11 games. In a September game at Kentucky, Franklin, the Rebels quarterback, was running with the football toward the Rebels’ bench, when three Kentucky players slammed him at the sideline, across the bench and into a brick wall. Franklin went down hard and stayed down. “Frightening,” Khayat called it. Doc Knight, the Ole Miss trainer, raced toward Franklin, yelling “Waxie! Waxie! Are you OK, Waxie?” Finally, Franklin looked up, grinned and said, ”I’m fine, Doc, but how are my fans taking it?”
Knight doubled as the Ole Miss track and field coach, and Franklin was one of his sprinters. Once , at practice, Knight was at the finish line timing Franklin in the 100-yard dash. Franklin finished and Knight started yelling. “He just ran a 9.6 100-yard dash!” There was plenty reason for his excitement, because the world record at the time, held by a German, was 9.76 seconds. Turns out, unbeknownst to Knight, Waxie had moved up five yards from the starting line. He may still hold the world record in the 95-yard dash.

Bobby Ray Franklin wore No. 10 at Ole Miss.
Back to that Kentucky game in 1959 and the injury: Franklin’s head was OK, but his left leg was not. He was stepped on with cleat marks on his left calf, resulting in a blood clot. Hospitalized for three weeks, he lost his starting quarterback job to the great Jake Gibbs, who was backed by Doug Elmore. Franklin played only sparingly for the remainder of the regular season, including the 7-3 defeat to LSU that ruined an otherwise perfect season. Healthy for the first time since September, Franklin came back for the Sugar Bowl rematch with LSU to complete 10 of 15 passes, two for touchdowns, in the 21-0 Ole Miss victory. Franklin was voted the game’s MVP, just as he had been in the 1958 Gator Bowl victory over Florida.
At 5 feet, 11 inches, Franklin was not a prime NFL prospect. The Cleveland Browns got him in the 11th round, and, boy, did they get a bargain. Franklin became an instant starter as a ball-hawking safety and kick returner. He also was the team’s backup punter and placekicker and held for the extra points and field goals of Browns kicking star Lou “The Toe” Groza, a Pro Football Hall of Famer. Franklin once told this sports writer, laughing: “I always told Lou he wouldn’t have been worth a damn without me as his holder.”
Franklin also had been the holder for Khayat’s kicks at Ole Miss. Said Khayat, “The thing was, Waxie was as good a kicker as I was. Great punter, too.”
Franklin retired as a player after seven seasons with the Browns and immediately joined Bud Carson’s coaching staff at Georgia Tech. Among his first recruits to Tech was Meridian’s Smylie Gebhart, who became an All American. Landry, the Hall of Fame coach of the Dallas Cowboys, hired Franklin away from Tech for a five-year run that included two Super Bowl victories. Franklin left Dallas to join Howard Schnellenberger’s staff in Baltimore, but that staff was fired after one season.

His career at a crossroads, Franklin joined his older brother in a private business in Mississippi. That lasted five years before Franklin went back to coaching. Ray Poole, a long-time friend and former Ole Miss coach, had taken the job as head coach at Northwest Community College in Senatobia and offered Franklin a job as offensive coordinator. This was 1979. A guy who had won an NFL championship as a player and two Super Bowl rings as a coach, was asked to be a junior college assistant coach. Franklin once told a sports writer, “I knew what people were thinking. What a comedown: from Super Bowls to junior college. Why would he do that? I didn’t care what people thought. I loved football. I wanted back.”
Two years later, he became the Northwest head coach. Two years after that, Franklin’s Northwest Rangers won the national junior college championship. Ten years after that, they would duplicate the feat. In 2004, Franklin retired having won 201 games, while losing only 57. Thirty-five of his players went on to play professionally.
Speaking by phone Thursday morning of his nearly life-long friend, Khayat said, “One of the most endearing things about Waxie is how emotional, how quick to cry, he was. He would even cry about happy things. When he went into the Coaches Hall of Fame, he started talking about his former players and coaches and he started crying, I mean, really sobbing. I didn’t know if he would even finish, and then he slapped himself in the face. I mean, slapped himself hard, and he said, ‘Come on, Franklin, stop being a crying fool.’ And then he was fine after that. Gave a great speech.”
When you know that about Franklin, it makes what follows all the more impressive. This was Aug. 7, 2007, in Canton, Ohio. Gene Hickerson, the great Ole Miss and Cleveland Browns lineman, was being inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Hickerson, stricken with Alzheimer’s, was in a wheelchair and seemingly oblivious to what was going on around him. Hickerson’s family had asked Franklin to be his presenter that night.
It remains one of the most poignant moments experienced in my nearly six decades of sports writing. Jim Brown, Leroy Kelly and Bobby Mitchell, the three Browns running backs Hickerson helped block into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, pushed Hickerson’s wheelchair onto the stage and Bobby Ray Franklin, at the podium, took a moment to gather himself. Then, he congratulated the other honorees, said what an honor it was to present his friend of 52 years, and continued: “Gene’s son, Bob Hickerson, called me and asked me if I would present Gene. The fact that Gene has been ill for the last several years, I was a little hesitant because being as close as we  were, it’s a tough thing for me to do, as you can see right here, today. I’ve got to make myself tough when I start talking about Gene…”

Franklin paused again, gathered himself again, and spoke thoughtfully and eloquently, saying what he imagined Hickerson would have said if he were capable of saying anything at all. And then he said this: “Gene finished his entire career as a member of the Cleveland Browns, a fact he was extremely proud of. He quietly did his job as well as anyone ever in NFL history. If not for the circumstances, I would be almost to the point of introducing my good friend to you. Gene would then step to the podium, tell you how thrilled he is to receive this honor today, and crack a joke or two.
“Unfortunately he won’t be doing that, as my friend will not be able to speak to you even though he is here, I love Gene Hickerson as if he were my brother. … Borrowing these words from another Hall of Famer, Gale Sayers, I would like to ask you all to love Gene Hickerson, too.”
Bobby Ray Franklin might have been the only person among thousands there that evening who did not cry. His speech was on-point, splendid even – as was his life.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/15145104/Bobby-Ray-Franklin-1960-Sugar-Bowl-MVP-1959-team-with-Coach-John-Vaught.jpg,,,2025-05-15 17:17:09.163697
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-15 20:48:49+00:00,CT Mirror,CT House debates bill placing limits on library e-book contracts,Ginny Monk,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/15/ct-library-e-book-contracts-passes/,The bill would put restrictions on contracts with e-book publishers to try to address the costs of e-books and audiobooks for libraries.,"After years of trying to address the high costs of electronic and audiobooks for libraries, state representatives on Thursday appeared poised to give final passage to a bill that would ban public libraries from entering into contracts with e-book publishers that contain terms that some lawmakers called restrictive.
E-book contracts for libraries often come with terms that mean the library has to re-purchase the book after it’s been borrowed 26 times or every couple of years, whichever comes first. Senate Bill 1234 wouldn’t allow simultaneous restrictions on the loan period and the number of times people can borrow the book.
The bill would only go into effect if one or more states with a total or combined population of 7 million enact similar laws. It mandates that the state librarian check quarterly whether any other states have passed a similar law.
Librarians and patrons across the state have advocated in favor of the bill, saying some of the terms e-book publishers mandate make it expensive and difficult to access electronic versions of books. Co-chair of the Government Administration and Elections Committee Rep. Matt Blumenthal, D-Stamford, said libraries already pay four to five times the market price of a book.
“These restrictions are wasting taxpayer dollars, and they are also interfering with our libraries’ general operations and ability to serve their patrons,” Blumenthal said.
The bill drew opposition and lengthy debate in the House and Senate from Republicans who argued against statewide mandates on towns and what they called government interference in the free market.
“‘We’re going to force you, we’re going to coerce you into lowering your prices,’” said Rep. Gale Mastrofrancesco, R-Wolcott, a ranking member on the GAE committee. “That’s not how government works. That’s not how America works.”
Democrats have for years tried to find a solution to the burdens e-book contracts put on libraries, but past efforts have stalled. 
The issue has come up more frequently as more people read books on their Kindles, iPads or smartphones. Listening to audiobooks has also become more popular over the past decade.

The bill would also require that contracts allow inter-library loans and ban secrecy clauses that prevent libraries from talking to each other about the terms of the agreement. The contracts wouldn’t be allowed to restrict the duration of the agreement unless it allows either a pay-per-use model or perpetual public use of the literature.
“There’s obviously a lot of interest, particularly from the library community, about some of the restrictions that these providers place on their ability to share with people,” said House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford.
Rep. Anne Dauphinais, R-Killingly, said she didn’t want to see more mandates on towns.
“It seems to me like we’re going in a direction of becoming the mandate state,” Dauphinais said. “We want to put everything we can, shove everything we can up the towns’ butts, whatever it is, whether it’s a mandate for this or a mandate for that.”
Umair Kazi, director of policy and advocacy at The Authors Guild, submitted testimony opposing the bill, saying it could harm Connecticut authors and access to books.
“We fear that by prohibiting Connecticut libraries from entering into licenses that contain these common terms that the legislature will impact the availability of books in Connecticut libraries,” Kazi said in written testimony. “Publishers will likely not concede to changing the terms and their business model, and as a consequence, Connecticut libraries would not be able to license many new books or renew existing license for what could be a substantial portion of their catalogue.”
In public testimony on the bill, librarians said the contracts already restrict access to books.
“The high prices of eBooks make it difficult for libraries to purchase all of the eBooks their communities demand,” Ellen Paul, executive director of the Connecticut Library Consortium wrote in testimony. “In our public libraries, the wait lists for eBooks are regularly 6 months long.

Gone would be the “complicated math game,” that she says she knew well — weighing whether missing a shift’s pay meant she would still be able to afford things like a gallon of milk, the electricity bill, or laundry. 
“I imagined a near future where I could work hard and make a living and be present for my family and my kids when they need me,” Phillips, a server in Springfield, said at a rally Thursday in front of the Missouri Capitol. 
But now, she said, “because of politicians’ decision to undo the will of the people — the votes that we gathered — I will no longer have the ability to earn paid sick time and the relief of knowing that I have the choice between a paycheck and my family’s health.”
 Andi Phillips, a leader with Missouri Jobs for Justice, speaks at a rally on the Missouri Capitol steps Thursday (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
Hundreds gathered on the steps of the Capitol Thursday afternoon to protest the passage of two bills the day prior by GOP lawmakers seeking to overturn initiatives approved by voters in November. One bill gutted Missouri’s paid sick leave law and the other will put an abortion ban back on the ballot. 
“What happened yesterday is a travesty of what’s supposed to be democracy,” said Daniel Chura, organizer with Missouri Jobs with Justice, which helped lead the campaign for the paid sick leave law. 
“When we look behind at this building, we know it’s not democracy that’s going on,” he added. “But when we see what’s gathered on these steps today, this is what democracy looks like.” 
Attendees led chants of “this is what democracy looks like,” along with “we are the worker, the mighty, mighty worker.” They said it’s not the end of the fight for paid leave, and vowed to reject the abortion ban.
They held American flags and signs ranging from “Workers over billionaires” and “No forced pregnancies,” to “Missouri GOP: Gonna Override the People.” 
 ‘Unmitigated gall’

Wednesday evening, Missouri Senate Republicans invoked a rarely-used rule to shut down a Democratic filibuster and repeal the paid sick leave law and put an abortion ban on the ballot with language that does not mention banning abortion. 
The abortion amendment will appear on the November 2026 ballot, unless Gov. Mike Kehoe decides to hold a vote sooner. 
Missouri Republicans shut down Senate debate to pass abortion ban, repeal sick leave law

The paid-sick leave benefits, which went into effect on May 1, will be stripped away on Aug. 28 if Kehoe signs the bill passed Wednesday.  
That bill also removes the requirement that the minimum wage be indexed to inflation, which has been in place since 2007. The paid sick leave and minimum wage provisions passed with nearly 58% of the vote in November as Proposition A, garnering support from unions, workers’ advocacy groups, social justice and civil rights groups, as well as over 500 business owners. 
The measure made sick leave guaranteed for around 728,000 workers who lacked it statewide, or over 1 in 3 Missouri workers, according to an analysis from the progressive nonprofit the Missouri Budget Project. 
In November, more than 1.6 million Missourians voted “yes” on the measure — more than the number who voted for U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley that election.
Don Looney, a leader of UAW Local 2250, referred to the “unmitigated gall” of lawmakers telling voters “you didn’t understand what you were voting for” by overturning paid sick leave.
“Your Missouri legislature has gone rogue,” Looney said. 
GOP critics portrayed paid sick leave as a “job killer” that would hurt small businesses, and as a “one-size-fits-all” mandate for businesses. 
House Speaker Jon Patterson said in a press conference Thursday he agreed with paid sick leave in principle but not as it was laid out in Prop A. 
“I want people that are sick to be able to stay home and not have to work,” Patterson said. “The way that it was done in Prop A it just was not workable. So I hope in the future what we see is something where employees are able to get their sick leave, but maybe not having mandates.”
Regarding the repeal of Prop A without input from the voters, Patterson said: “They do get to have their voice. They get to go out and vote for their elected representatives, and they come to Jefferson City and make decisions.”
 ‘We’ll win again’ 

 Jen Kruse, from Tipton, holds up a sign in protest of the Missouri State Legislature’s decision to pass legislation to overturn voters’ recent ballot measures. “I wish reason would take over,” she told The Independent. (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
Amendment 3, which rolled back Missouri’s abortion ban and opened the door for clinics to begin performing the procedure for the first time since 2022, passed with 52% of the vote, or over 1.5 million votes, in November. 
The proposed ban that will now appear on the ballot seeks to repeal the constitutional right to an abortion but allow exceptions for medical emergencies, fatal fetal anomalies and for survivors of rape and incest in the first 12 weeks of gestation. 
Abortion rights activists on Thursday led chants of “we’re not going back.” 
“Voters have spoken,” said Mary Ann Perkins with Abortion Action Missouri. “No forced pregnancy.” 
The proposed ban, if approved by a simple majority of voters, would reinstate several targeted regulations on abortion providers, or TRAP laws, that were recently struck down as unconstitutional by a Missouri judge. 
It seeks to ban gender transition surgeries and puberty blockers for minors, something that is already illegal in Missouri. 
“No politician has the right to dictate what goes on in the doctor’s office or in our private lives,” said Nancy O’Brien with Abortion Access Missouri. 
 Battle continues

Terrence Wise, a low-wage worker with Stand up KC and Missouri Workers Center, said when he saw the news about the Senate vote Wednesday, he thought about all the days he went to work sick, or brought his children to work sick with 100 degree fevers because he lacked paid leave. 
He said the repeal could be “fatal,” with people coming into work instead of getting needed care. 
“Despite this clear mandate from the people, corporate interests refused to listen,” he said.
Wise said Missourians in Democratic and Republican districts “voted for economic dignity and for working people…a clear message that no one should have to choose between their health and affording rent.” 
Advocates said they’ll consider putting the issue on the ballot again as a constitutional amendment, a move that would make it much harder for lawmakers to repeal.
Ray Thomas, a union electrician and leader with Missouri Jobs with Justice, said in an interview with The Independent she was so “jubilant” when the ballot measure passed in November that she cried. It was a “relief” to, for the first time in her career, though she is nearing retirement, have time off when she or a family member is sick. 
Thomas collected 2,000 signatures to put the issue on the ballot last year and said talking to voters, she realized the issue transcended partisan divides — that it was about basic human rights.
Initially the news of yesterday’s repeal vote was “depleting” but she said now, it’s just “round two.”
“The battle’s back on,” Thomas said.

But the program could make the state a target for Medicaid cuts Republicans in Congress are pursuing.
Washington opened its Apple Health Expansion program for immigrants without legal status last year. Enrollment remains capped based on available funding, which is set to be maintained at roughly $150 million in the next two-year budget. The budget bill is awaiting a signature from Gov. Bob Ferguson.
This week, Republicans in the U.S. House pushed ahead with legislation that would penalize states that have these kinds of health care programs for immigrants. 
The federal government pays 90% of the cost of covering enrollees who qualify for Medicaid under expanded income eligibility guidelines in the 2010 Affordable Care Act. That match would decrease to 80% if states choose to keep covering immigrants with programs like Washington’s.
In total, Washington state received around $20 billion in Medicaid funding from the federal government during the 2023 federal fiscal year, according to KFF, a nonpartisan health research organization. KFF data also show that, as of 2021, about 821,000 people were covered under the Affordable Care Act expansion where Republicans are looking to reduce the federal match. 
Washington’s Health Care Authority, which oversees the state’s Medicaid program, said they are closely monitoring federal discussions about potential changes to Medicaid funding. But it wasn’t immediately clear what the possible cut could mean for the state in dollar terms.
Local advocates have praised the Apple Health Expansion program for immigrants, saying it extends a critical safety net to a community that has been excluded. 
“Immigrants came forward this session with the full knowledge that doing so could mean deportation — or worse,” Catalina Velasquez, executive director of the Washington Immigrant Solidarity Network, said in a statement. 
“These victories are the result of decades of movement-building, sacrifice, and visionary struggle to ensure all immigrants have the resources needed to thrive,” she added. 
Federal law prohibits noncitizens from accessing public benefits such as Medicaid, but states can use state dollars to create programs for this community. 
About 1.8 million residents in Washington were covered by Medicaid or the related Children’s Health Insurance Program in December, according to U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services figures. Washington’s Medicaid program is called Apple Health. 
The Apple Health Expansion program for immigrants designed to mirror Medicaid and is funded solely by the state, whereas the traditional Medicaid program is funded with both federal and state dollars. 
The expansion launched on July 1, 2024 with enough funding to cover up to 13,000 people. Within the first 48 hours, all slots were filled, and an additional 17,000 people signed up for the waiting list. 
Washington state Republicans have criticized the program and argue the state needs to be more careful with its spending, especially given a multi-billion dollar budget shortfall lawmakers just worked to solve. They’ve also said that the state shouldn’t be maintaining services for noncitizens while cutting services for others.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/maternal-health.jpg,,,2025-05-15 17:17:09.163697

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A budget deal state leaders struck on Wednesday will boost funding for Oklahoma public schools and raise the ceiling on teacher pay in the 2026 fiscal year.
After giving a similar increase last year, Gov. Kevin Stitt and legislative leaders agreed to pour another $25 million into public education funding, but this time with a caveat from House Bill 1087. Accompanying the extra $25 million will be a one-day increase to the minimum length of an Oklahoma school year. Students must have at least 166 days of instruction rather than 165. 
HB 1087 also extends the teacher salary schedule by 15 years, meaning public school teachers will receive annual step raises for up to 40 years instead of reaching their maximum salary at 25 years. 
A classroom teacher with a bachelor’s degree must earn a salary of at least $64,021 after 40 years, under the bill.
“What we have been saying again and again repeatedly is what we need to invest in (and) focus on in public education is making sure we’re recruiting and retaining quality educators and making sure we’re having as much quality time in front of those educators as possible,” House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, said at a news conference Wednesday where the budget deal was revealed.

Senate Minority Leader Julia Kirt, D-Oklahoma City, said $25 million is “not adequate” to help public schools counteract rising costs from inflation, especially while the cap for tax credits supporting private school students is pre-scheduled to increase by $50 million.
“Twenty-five million dollars is not enough to do the transformative change we need to have in the classroom,” Kirt told reporters on Thursday.
The Oklahoma State Department of Education budget, which covers most appropriations for K-12 schools, will increase by 3.15% to $3.98 billion.
That’s an even larger funding boost than the Education Department’s head, state Superintendent Ryan Walters, requested. But in doing so, lawmakers and the governor discarded several of Walters’ ideas.
The agency’s budget includes no funds for Bibles, despite Walters’ request for $3 million to buy a copy for every public school classroom. His ask for $500,000 to give educators concealed-carry firearm training, $1 million for a new teacher induction program, and $1 million to recruit military veterans and former law enforcement officers to the teacher workforce also went unheeded.
An Education Department spokesperson declined to comment Thursday.
Another $1 million in “efficiencies” from the agency, which has lost dozens of employees over the past two years, will transfer from the Education Department to public schools.

The Legislature dedicated $5 million to a high-dosage tutoring program inspired by a similar initiative Walters established at the Education Department. Both the House and Senate have advanced legislation to pay reading and math tutors to meet with struggling students multiple times a week.
Lawmakers agreed with Walters’ request to boost the state’s teacher maternity leave fund by $4 million. Walters advised that demand for the $2.5 million fund has been high and the number of participating districts is growing.
Another major incentive for longtime teachers made the cut in the state’s budget for higher education. The Legislature will dedicate an extra $740,310 to the Oklahoma’s Promise college scholarship program to include children of classroom teachers with 10 or more years of experience.
Members of the state’s largest teacher union, the Oklahoma Education Association, are feeling “optimistic” after seeing lawmakers prioritize teacher benefits this year, the organization’s president, Cari Elledge, said.
She said the 15-year increase to the salary schedule “will hopefully give people a reason to stay” in the classroom.
“This might help keep some people in the profession longer, which could benefit students because these are people who don’t have to be trained and know what they’re doing,” Elledge said.
Education Department loses control of asthma inhaler funds
The new state budget moves a $250,000 asthma inhaler fund away from the Education Department to the University Hospitals Authority and Trust, the entity that oversees hospitals on the University of Oklahoma medical campus. 
The state Legislature created the $250,000 fund in 2023 to distribute asthma inhalers to all public schools. Lawmakers became openly frustrated last summer after more than a year had passed without the agency disbursing any of the money.
Attorney General Gentner Drummond, who was asked to investigate the matter, found the Education Department was “neither speedy nor responsible” with the program and showed a “lack of understanding of basic purchasing procedures.”

The Education Department still has not spent the $250,000, said the Senate’s budget leader, Sen. Chuck Hall, R-Perry. In the meantime, he said the University Hospitals Authority and Trust has been working with the Brendon McLarty Memorial Foundation to provide inhalers to schools.
“We now have experience with them and their ability and their desire to be part of this program,” Hall said of the hospitals authority. “So we’ll just take that money and put it over there and let them administer the program.”

[…],"A food delivery robot rolls through the campus at the University of South Carolina. (Photo courtesy of the University of South Carolina)COLUMBIA — Gov. Henry McMaster’s first veto this year struck a bill creating rules for the kind of autonomous robots already delivering food on the University of South Carolina campus.
The bill authored by House Minority Leader Todd Rutherford came a year after USC made robotic food deliveries an option on its downtown Columbia campus. The six-wheeled deliveries are a partnership between Grubhub and Starship Technologies, a California-based company that makes the robots that look like smart coolers.
The university website touts that it’s providing students a “futuristic delivery service.”
“Now you can have your favorite on-campus foods brought to you by robot!” reads a webpage for the partnership.
Rutherford, a Columbia Democrat, said the legislation was meant to set guidelines for the robots that crisscross campus and ensure their increasing popularity doesn’t lead to irresponsible copycat services.
“The group that is currently doing it has a safety record that is unmatched,” he told the SC Daily Gazette on Thursday. “But that does not prohibit … you and I starting up our own personal delivery devices and driving recklessly wherever we wanted to.”
Under his bill, co-signed by all 11 other House members who represent a piece of Richland County, the robots could be no bigger than 36-by-30 inches, weigh no more than 150 pounds, and travel a maximum of 10 mph. At night, the boxy robots must have front and back lights “visible and recognizable under normal atmospheric conditions” from 500 feet away.
The bill also requires operators to carry insurance policies covering at least $500,000 per claim, should something go wrong.
In his only veto message so far this year, McMaster said he doesn’t have a problem with the bill itself. The problem, he wrote, is that it only applies to Richland County, which flouts the state constitution’s rule against local legislation.
“I appreciate that the underlying aim … is to ensure that new technology is effectively and safely utilized for the benefit of South Carolinians,” he wrote in his letter Tuesday to the House explaining his veto.
“Even if personal delivery devices are currently confined to Richland County, I am aware of no reason why these same regulations for personal delivery could not be adopted in a general law and apply across the entire state,” he concluded.
Regardless, the Legislature could still vote to override McMaster’s veto with a two-thirds majority in each chamber. The 2025 session ended last week. But the resolution that governs the off-session allows the General Assembly to take up vetoes when the chambers return to finalize the state budget package.
But Rutherford questioned whether the chambers’ leaders would want to bother.
If not, a bill addressing the issue statewide is already in the works. It passed the House 97-0 last month and was sent to the Senate Transportation Committee, where it awaits action when the Legislature returns in January.
If the House’s vote is any indication, passage shouldn’t be a problem, Rutherford said.
He argued it made sense to start the regulations in the only county where the technology’s used.
“I can only regulate that which I’ve seen and know about in order to make it work,” he said. “Rather than do something statewide with a new technology, I think you start off as small as possible.”
Local legislation can also get approval much faster, particularly in the upper chamber. Generally, passage is the purview of the legislators representing that county. Six senators represent a piece of Richland County.
McMaster’s only veto
Rutherford noted that McMaster did sign another bill that’s local legislation. To be consistent, he said, the governor should have also vetoed the bill regarding the boundaries of Greenville’s sanitation district.
“I am shocked at the hypocrisy of vetoing one bill because it’s local legislation and signing” the other, Rutherford said.
In a letter to the sanitation act’s lead sponsor, GOP Rep. David Vaughan of Simpsonville, McMaster acknowledged that he normally shoots down “local or special legislation that is clearly unconstitutional.”
However, in this situation, the specific law is the best way to address the situation, McMaster wrote, and “it is not readily apparent how a general law could be made applicable without being overbroad in scope,” he wrote.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/STARSHIPROBOTS-8-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-15 17:17:09.163697

“I’m so grateful to Governor Mills for the tremendous opportunity she gave me to dive into Maine’s biggest challenges and lead work across her administration to chart a path to solutions,” Pingree said in a news release from the governor’s office Thursday. 
Though the release didn’t specify what Pingree plans to do next, she said she will “remain relentlessly focused on the future of the state we all love.” The Bangor Daily News has reported that Pingree is expected to throw her hat in the ring for the Democratic gubernatorial primary next year. 
Prior to her time in the executive branch, Pingree served four terms in the Maine Legislature including two years as speaker of the state House of Representatives. She is also the daughter of Maine’s 1st Congressional District representative.
Pingree has served as director of the Governor’s Office of Policy Innovation and the Future, also known as GOPIF, since 2019. The agency was created by Gov. Janet Mills to recommend policy solutions for some of the state’s biggest issues and focuses on climate change, housing, workforce development, the opioid crisis and more. 
Mills said in the release that she asked Pingree to lead the office because she knew she had the ability to bring people together and develop innovative solutions based on her background in local and state government.
Under Pingree’s leadership, GOPIF helped advance legislation that created the Maine Climate Council to support the state in meeting its greenhouse gas emission reduction goals while investing in local infrastructure. Pingree served as co-chair of the council, which also created the state’s climate action plan that outlines strategies for electrifying transportation and home heating, among other initiatives. 
Pingree’s office has worked to expand housing options in the state amid a shortage of thousands of units. The agency designed programs such as the Rural Affordable Rental Housing Program and the Affordable Homeownership Program, which have helped create hundreds of new single-family homes and rental units. 
“She and her team at GOPIF have exceeded my expectations at every step, and I look forward to watching her do great things for Maine in the years to come,” Mills said of Pingree.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma House lawmakers on Thursday sent a bill to the governor’s desk that would raise the age of sexual consent from 16 to 18.
House Bill 1003 also contains a so-called “Romeo and Juliet” provision, that protects 20 year olds from prosecution if they are within four years of age of a sexual partner.
If signed into law by Gov. Kevin Stitt, Oklahoma would become one of about a dozen states that requires the age of consent to be 18.
Rep. Jim Olsen, R-Roland, who authored the measure, said lawmakers decided to expand the age window to protect 20 year olds who have consensual sexual relations with minors because Oklahoma students with disabilities may attend school until they’re 20.
He said the bill balances protecting teenagers who are having consensual sexual relationships with each other from getting charged with rape, while also protecting them from 35 and 40 year olds who may try to prey on them. He said current law permits a 16-year-old girl to have sex with a 100-year-old man.
State Rep. Andy Fugate, D-Oklahoma City, who voted against the measure, said he didn’t support allowing a 20-year-old man to have sex with a 16-year-old girl.
“The age gap here is not trivial,” he said. “This creates a power imbalance,. Oone where young impressionable girls can be manipulated and taken advantage of.”
Fugate said he might be on board with extending the grace period to 19, but once someone turns 20 or 21, they are no longer teenagers.
“We are being asked to allow adults to have extramarital sex with children,” he said.
The measure passed the House by a 54-26 vote.

Free.,What to know about the U.S. House GOP’s student loan overhaul,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/what-know-about-us-house-gops-student-loan-overhaul,,"WASHINGTON — Students and families could see significant changes to how student loans are repaid as well as cuts to federal student aid as congressional Republicans look to slash billions of dollars in federal spending to offset the cost of President Donald Trump’s sweeping agenda.Republicans are using the complex reconciliation process to move a package through Congress with simple majority votes in each chamber, avoiding the Senate’s 60-vote threshold that generally requires bipartisanship.The House Committee on Education and Workforce approved its portion of the package in a party-line vote in April, pushing GOP lawmakers a step closer to potentially securing key changes to student loan repayment options and Pell Grant eligibility.Chairman Tim Walberg, a Michigan Republican, said the 103-page bill would save taxpayers more than $350 billion over 10 years and “bring much-needed reform” on “simplified loan repayment, streamlined student loan options, and accountability for students and taxpayers.”But the bill has drawn criticism and worry from student advocates and congressional Democrats over how the proposed changes would impact higher education affordability and access.Aissa Canchola Bañez, policy director at the Student Borrower Protection Center, told States Newsroom that the advocacy group was “really troubled to see House Republicans take such a drastic approach to their efforts to address the college affordability crisis.”“Unfortunately, this bill will make college more expensive for families and students and will make it significantly more risky for students and families just trying to pay for college, and it’s also going to make student loan debt significantly more expensive for millions of borrowers across the country,” she said.Rep. Bobby Scott, ranking member of the committee, echoed the concerns of student advocacy groups.The Virginia Democrat said the bill would “increase costs for colleges and students,” “limit students’ access to quality programs” and take “all the so-called ‘savings’ to pay for more tax cuts for the wealthy and the well-connected.”Here’s a breakdown of some of the major changes outlined in the House education panel’s portion of the package:The bill would repeal subsidized loans — where the federal government pays the interest on the loan while a borrower is in school — for borrowers beginning July 1, 2026, according to the committee’s summary. For unsubsidized loans disbursed on or after July 1, 2026, the maximum annual loan limit would be amended to the “median cost of students’ program of study.”The total amount of federal student aid a person could receive annually would also be capped at the “median cost of college.” According to the committee, this is defined as “the median cost of attendance for students enrolled in the same program of study nationally and calculated by the (Education) Secretary using data from the previous award year.”Aggregate limits, or the maximum amount a student can borrow, would cap at $50,000 for undergraduate programs; $100,000 for graduate programs; and $150,000 for professional programs, such as law or medical school.The bill also repeals the Grad PLUS program and places new restrictions on Parent PLUS loans.Undergraduate students would be required to “exhaust their unsubsidized loans before parents can utilize Parent PLUS to cover their remaining cost of attendance,” according to the panel’s summary.Canchola Bañez noted that the repeal of the Grad PLUS program would increase the likelihood that students would have to take out loans in the private market to fill gaps they would have normally filled by using Grad PLUS loans.“We know that private loans have much less protections and consumer protections for borrowers,” she said, adding that “the more we push folks out of the federal market and into the private market, the less students and borrowers have access to those protections should things go wrong after school.”‘Skin-in-the-game accountability’The package also proposes “skin-in-the-game accountability” for colleges and universities, and institutions would have to pay the federal government “a percentage of the non-repayment balance associated with loans disbursed on or after July 1, 2027,” according to the panel’s summary.Preston Cooper, senior fellow in higher education policy at a right-leaning think tank, the American Enterprise Institute, said “essentially, for colleges whose borrowers require some of this repayment assistance, if their payments are too low to cover interest on their loans, or they require that principal credit, the colleges will have to cover a share of the costs.” “They won’t have to cover all the costs — the government will pay some of it — but they will have to cover some of the cost of providing borrowers with that repayment assistance, and I think the idea here is to create better incentives for colleges to make sure that they’re not loading students up with unnecessary debt,” he said.Pell Grant eligibilityThe bill redefines full-time enrollment for Pell Grants — a federal government subsidy that helps low-income students pay for college.The legislation raises the minimum number of credit hours to qualify for the maximum Pell Grant award from 12 credit hours per semester to 15 credit hours. Students would also be ineligible for a Pell Grant if their Student Aid Index — a formula-based number to determine financial aid eligibility — equals or surpasses twice the amount of the maximum Pell Grant.Pell Grant eligibility would also be expanded for those in short-term programs between eight and 15 weeks long.Repealing the SAVE planThe bill creates just two repayment plans — a Standard Repayment Plan and a Repayment Assistance Plan, while eliminating the Biden administration’s Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan, which is currently tied up in federal court. The Standard Repayment Plan includes fixed monthly payments and repayment terms between 10 to 25 years depending on how much one borrows, per the committee, while the Repayment Assistance Plan calculates payments based on a borrower’s total adjusted gross income. The Repayment Assistance Plan also includes a minimum $10 monthly payment and “offers balance assistance to borrowers making their required on-time payments by waiving unpaid interest and providing a matching payment-to-principal of up to $50,” according to the panel. Cooper said the Repayment Assistance Plan “fixes one of the long-standing problems in the income-driven repayment system for student loans, which is that a lot of borrowers’ payments don’t cover their accrued interest, which means that they see their balances rise over time.”",,,,2025-05-15 17:17:09.163697

Connecticut’s Municipal Accountability Review Board (MARB) voted unanimously Thursday to end its control of the city’s finances, to cheers from city employees at City Hall.
Mayor Dorinda Borer, said city residents can now feel confident their tax dollars are being managed with integrity.
“They can know that the people they elected are working for them,” Borer said.
[RELATED: Former CT Rep. Michael DiMassa sentenced to 27 months in prison]
The MARB decision takes effect immediately. Borer and other officials say the city’s financial independence means it can more easily negotiate contracts and attract development.
The decision comes a few years after a COVID-19 fund scandal, where former State Rep. Michael DiMassa, was convicted for stealing more than $1 million in COVID-19 relief funds.
The state had already scrutinized West Haven’s budget years prior, but MARB officials credited Borer for the change in the city’s work culture.
Borer said the city can now more easily attract outside investment.
“It’s going to give me an opportunity; for investors and developers,” Borer said. “We’ve been doing a good job of courting them here to West Haven and showing what we’re doing, but we always had that state oversight hanging over our head.”
According to the latest available independent audit letter available on the MARB site for fiscal year 2024, the city has made improvements during the previous year.
But it stated the city needed further improvement on several metrics, including bank reconciliations, which compare the financial records of an entity such as the city with bank statements to ensure accuracy.
The board was already scrutinizing the city’s finances over an $18 million deficit according to Borer, before DiMassa’s case. But the scandal led to the state gaining significant oversight over the city’s budget, contracts and debt. The MARB noted the city made good faith efforts at improving financial safeguards.
Other West Haven officials including Emergency Management Director Rick Fontana, and Finance Director Michael Gormany celebrated Borer’s announcement at City Hall. Gormany, who became the director a year ago, said much of the transformation took place recently.

“Over the last year, we’ve continued the work of just making sure that we have financial policies, procedures, audits, and different things in place to continue the great work for the City of West Haven,” Gormany said.
Fontana addressed the crowd shortly after the board made its announcement, praising Borer. The city’s financial independence also means the city no longer needs a middleman for routine financial operations, according to Fontana.
“It certainly puts us in a better position for negotiating contracts. We’ll negotiate the contracts here with our union reps and the mayor, and not have it under a state oversight committee,” Fontana said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/West-Haven-finances_CT-Public-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-16 11:10:49.504041
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-15 20:13:42+00:00,CT Mirror,Advocates urge CT lawmakers to approve Trust Act expansion,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/15/trust-act-expansion-immigration-ct/,"Amid intensifying federal immigration enforcement, as 2025 legislative session nears its close, CT advocates push for Trust Act expansion.","Immigrant rights advocates and faith leaders packed a room at the state Capitol Thursday to pressure lawmakers to pass a bill that would place further limits on how law enforcement and businesses in the state interface with federal immigration authorities.  
H.B 7212 would add provisions to a current state law known as the Trust Act, which regulates how local and state police cooperate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. The Trust Act generally prohibits Connecticut law enforcement from arresting someone solely on the basis of a detainer — a request from ICE that police hold a person for up to 48 hours so federal agents can pick them up — with some exceptions.
The bill would prohibit public agencies in Connecticut from sharing information with ICE such as a person’s home address, workplace, school or “the date, time or location of a person’s hearings, proceedings or appointments with the public agency.” It also prohibits arrest or detention at courthouses based solely on a civil immigration detainer. 
In the wake of a recent decision by Avelo Airlines — which has a major hub in Connecticut — to contract with the Department of Homeland Security to carry out deportation flights, the legislature’s Judiciary Committee added language to the bill prohibiting state agencies from contracting with a company unless the leaders and “key personnel” issue a statement saying they won’t cooperate with federal immigration authorities. 
As the 2025 legislative session nears its final days, and the Trump administration expands immigration enforcement, Connecticut advocates expressed concern for the bill’s fate.
During the press conference Thursday, Rev. Joshua Pawelek of the Unitarian Universalist Society East in Manchester said he felt that elected officials, particularly Gov. Ned Lamont, “ appear to be wavering in their support for strengthening the Trust Act.” 
Rev. Tracy Johnson Russell of St. Monica’s Episcopal Church in Hartford called on lawmakers not to back down because of fears of retribution from the federal government. 
“ I understand there is concern that  might mean we lose federal dollars that our state desperately needs,” said Johnson Russell. “ I don’t want that to happen any more than anyone else does. But you know what I want even less? To sell out the rights of our immigrant community members in exchange for some hypothetical future grants.” 
Democratic leaders say the bill is currently in “a good spot.” Speaker of the House Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, told reporters he expects the bill to come up for a vote in the House of Representatives next week. 
Rob Blanchard, a spokesperson for Gov. Ned Lamont, said in a statement that Lamont was “proud” to sign legislation in 2019 that expanded the Trust Act, but that he did not feel the law needed additional expansions. 
“Our local law enforcement agencies are focused on maintaining the safety of our neighborhoods and the Governor is focused on making sure people feel safe in our schools, churches, and elsewhere. As many of the previous loopholes were closed, he does not believe the law needs to be revised,” the statement said. 
Blanchard told the Connecticut Mirror that Lamont wouldn’t support the law as it’s currently drafted, but he said the discussion with lawmakers is ongoing. 
On Wednesday, Ritter told reporters that he didn’t believe that the changes lawmakers were making to the bill would cause problems with the federal government.
“We’re not looking to provoke anybody, but I think we’re within the bounds of the rights of states to do it. And I think we’d rather err on the side of our values in helping people and trying to predict what might be a retaliatory response for doing what we’re legally able to do. We’re not going into federal powers, for sure,” he said. 
But House Minority Leader Vincent Candelora, R-North Branford, said he felt the Trust Act had already been pushed too far when it was expanded in 2019. 
“To double down and go further — I think it’s just an unnecessary political statement that they want to make,” said Candelora. “I am not interested in picking a fight with the federal government. I think we should be working with ICE to try to make our community safer, and that bill has just gone spiraling out of control in a direction that is not responsible for public safety for the residents of Connecticut.” 
David McGuire, executive director of the Connecticut chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, said the part of the bill most important to his organization was a provision allowing citizens to bring a lawsuit if the Trust Act is violated. 
“Without that, the Trust Act is merely a suggestion rather than a mandate,” McGuire told CT Mirror. 
Rep. Steven Stafstrom, D-Bridgeport, co-chair of the Judiciary Committee, said he was “ready to go” in bringing the bill for debate on the House floor. He denied that any particular part of the bill was holding up negotiations. But he also did not rule out the idea that the bill could be broken up, saying that they were “still working on it.” 
Lamont praised the current Trust Act during a press conference Thursday.
“We have a really strong, robust Trust Act. We go after felons and criminals and those that are a danger. And our police on the street, they don’t have time to sit around collecting people’s immigration status,” he said. “I think we’re in a good place there.”
He said there might be “other ways” to protect immigrants in Connecticut besides changing the Trust Act.

Rep. Maryam Khan, D-Windsor, and Rep. Farley Santos, D-Danbury, both of whom migrated to the U.S. as small children, spoke during the Thursday press conference. Farley Santos was undocumented when he arrived in the US at the age of 6, and he said he remembers his parents fear of driving over the speed limit.
“ And yet we continue to contribute to our community, to give back as often as we could. I’ll remind you that all those taxes that my parents paid, they were never able to get any of it back,” Santos said. 
Abby Fisher Williamson, a professor at Trinity College who researches immigration policy, questioned the idea that the bill would put Connecticut in the crosshairs of the federal government. 
“ What if we let this bill die because we’re scared — we’re scared of Trump’s retaliation? Will that stop him?” she said. “No.
“The institutions and jurisdictions that have capitulated to Trump’s overreach are not suddenly in his good graces,” she said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TRUST-ACT-0515_SR-6-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-15 17:17:09.163697

(Photo by Morgan Trau, WEWS.)High school students from Northeast Ohio testified at the Statehouse Wednesday, urging the lawmakers to fully fund education and support diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives.
“It’s very easy to make a decision that impacts many people — when that person isn’t you,” Cleveland Heights/University Heights City School District (CHUH) freshman Cavan Bruce said.
Four students and three educators made a two-and-a-half-hour drive — coming down from Cleveland Heights to Columbus — to fight for their school.
“I think it was just important for us to be there because we specifically represent diversity and we are all people of color,” CHUH freshman Kennedi Brown said.
Brown and freshman Emmanuel Gutierrez came to represent their district, testifying about the importance of school funding in front of the Senate Education Committee, urging the legislature not to restrict DEI initiatives.
“We all have an equal chance to be successful,” Gutierrez said.
The district would have received $7 million from the state under the expected funding formula. Due to the House cutting the education budget, they would only receive $700,000.
Both students are a part of multicultural clubs and music groups — both programs are at risk of being cut.
“We need a lot of funding to do music and be creative because a lot of people, especially in Cleveland Heights — they love art,” Brown said. “I should be able to produce my art.”
But Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman, R-Lima, claimed that schools are overspending, and there isn’t enough money in the budget to afford the high cost of per-pupil needs.
“One of our school districts spends about $12,000 per child,” he said about a Northwest Ohio school. “And [the superintendent] hastened to point out that the average was $16,300.”
We asked Huffman about the concerns that school clubs would be shut down. Huffman responded that he doesn’t think anyone is saying that cultural clubs would be shuttered.
He and state Rep. Josh Williams, R-Sylvania, say that DEI policies can actually stigmatize students — and can hurt Black, Brown, female, and students with disabilities.
“DEI policies are this closeted ghost that makes people believe that’s the only reason you’re in the room,” Williams said. “I want individuals to look inside of a particular room and see a Black individual and know they must be qualified to be there.”
Freshman Jesse Bowling disagreed, saying DEI initiatives empowered him to join school leadership.
“I was able to meet people just like me,” he said.
The students worry that the lawmakers won’t listen.
“Was the two and a half hour drive worth it?” we asked Bowling and Bruce.
“Well, it gives us a chance to have our voice heard,” Bruce responded.
“Being able to have our voices heard, even if they weren’t paying attention, it’s still the old saying, ‘It’s the thought that counts,'” Bowling said.
The budget will continue to be debated over the coming months.

(Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Eleven members of Gov. Dan McKee’s cabinet will see their salaries increase Sunday, after the Rhode Island Senate declined to stop the pay bumps from taking effect.
Senate President Valarie Lawson announced the news Thursday afternoon, one hour before the chamber’s scheduled floor session and its final opportunity to take up a resolution passed by the Rhode Island House of Representatives Tuesday.
“The Senate leadership considered whether this action by the executive branch warrants a highly unusual intervention by the legislative branch,” Lawson said in a statement. “We determined it does not.”
State law empowers the Rhode Island General Assembly to reject the executive’s proposed raises for department heads through a concurrent, joint resolution, which both chambers must vote on within 30 days of receiving the governor’s written proposal for pay hikes.
McKee sent the letter formalizing his proposed $82,000 worth of pay hikes for members of his cabinet to the legislature on April 18. 
On Tuesday, the House unanimously approved a resolution blocking the increases from taking effect — the first time on record the legislature has wielded its statutory authority to reject the governor’s annual pay raise plan. House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi sponsored the resolution, calling for prudence in a tight fiscal year. 
Shekarchi reiterated this viewpoint Thursday after Lawson broke the news that the Senate would not follow the House’s lead.
“I respect the Senate’s decision,” Shekarchi said in an emailed statement. “However, all 75 members co-sponsored the House resolution to block the raises and I stand behind the unanimous vote that was taken on Tuesday.  These are challenging and uncertain economic times and House members believe that Cabinet raises are not appropriate right now.”
The state is facing a $185 million deficit for fiscal 2026, along with major threats to federal funding, which comprises 35% of McKee’s proposed spending package. 
Lawson acknowledged Shekarchi’s concerns, along with the arguments put forth by McKee about raising wages to attract and retain key state administrators. 
“In some cases, director’s salaries have fallen behind the salaries of the staff in the departments they oversee,” Lawson said.
McKee’s office did not immediately return inquiries for comment Thursday.
Lawson’s move, or lack of, marks her first major decision since she was elected Senate president on April 29, following the death of the chamber’s former leader, Dominick Ruggerio. Her rise to power late in the session has shifted attention and pressure to the Senate on key votes, including a proposed ban on assault-style weapons and, potentially, raising taxes on top earners. 
Both bills have yet to advance out of committee in their respective chambers, with the Senate Committee on Judiciary having just concluded its initial hearing on a series of gun bills, including an assault weapons ban, Wednesday night.
As proposed by McKee, directors of nine departments will see their base salary increase by 5%: the Departments of Administration; Behavioral Healthcare, Developmental Disabilities and Hospitals; Business Regulation; Children, Youth and Families; Corrections; Environmental Management; Human Services; Labor and Training, and Revenue. 
The Department of Transportation director will get a 2% raise while the Rhode Island State Police superintendent, who also serves as director of the Department of Public Safety, will receive a 0.5% raise.

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)A woman from India who recently earned master’s and doctoral degrees from South Dakota Mines in Rapid City can’t be removed from the U.S. as her lawsuit against the federal government proceeds, a judge has ruled.
Priya Saxena sued U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem last month after Saxena learned that her visa had been revoked, and that Homeland Security had, in turn, terminated her record in the federal database that clears international students to study in the country.
U.S. District Judge Karen Schreier ruled on Thursday that the terms of a temporary restraining order against Homeland Security that she’d applied in the case last month should extend out for the duration of the lawsuit’s proceedings.
International student recounts ‘numb’ feeling after receiving email about her potential deportation

Saxena was among more than 1,000 students who’d had their student records scrubbed by Homeland Security in recent months. She’s also one of many who’d earned court orders to reverse the record removal. Homeland Security opted to reinstate the student records last month, and had argued in South Dakota court documents that doing so made Saxena’s lawsuit moot. 
Through her lawyer, Jim Leach of Rapid City, Saxena argued that it wasn’t moot, as without court intervention the government could resume its attempts to deport her at any point. 
Saxena collected her degrees from Mines on Saturday. 
Days later in court, Saxena told Schreier that she’d hoped to stay in the U.S. and apply to work under the U.S. Customs and Immigration Service’s Optional Practical Training (OPT) program, which allows international students to stay in the U.S. and work in their field following graduation.
In Thursday’s ruling, Judge Schreier wrote that the cloud of potential deportation proceedings should not hang over Saxena as she moves to participate in the post-degree work program.
“Saxena’s uncertain legal status as it relates to her ability to apply for OPT programs and the more-than speculative risk that she may be arrested and deported,” Schreier wrote, justifies an injunction to stop the federal government from interfering with Saxena’s plans.

Mark Wilkerson, an attorney for the Alabama Medical Cannabis Commission, updated the commission on ongoing legal cases. Wilkerson said three Court of Civil Appeals decisions over the past two and a half months ordered temporary restraining orders to be dissolved, but one of the denied applicants filed a petition requesting the Alabama Supreme Court review a decision made by the Court of Civil Appeals.
“We don’t have a timetable for what the Supreme Court may do in regard to that petition. If the (Alabama) Supreme Court issues an order requiring participation and briefing, this agency will do that,” Wilkerson said during the meeting.
The AMCC on February 14 opened a one-month window for parties to request an application for state testing laboratory licenses. From the five applications the commission received, the AMCC received one that had to be amended before being accepted. Justin Aday, general counsel for the commission, said that once the application was resubmitted, the only outstanding item was a background check.
“They had not yet received that completed background check from the FBI. Two days later on May 7, we did receive that FBI background check,” Aday said.
The commission approved the application, which will be made available during a 30-day period for public comments. The commission will hear the applicant’s presentation in a June 12 meeting and make the final decision at a June 17 meeting.
Under Alabama’s medical cannabis law passed in 2021, physicians can recommend the use of cannabis for patients with qualifying health issues. These conditions include chronic pain, PTSD, epilepsy and cancer-related pain. The law allows cannabis to be dispensed in forms such as tablets, tinctures, patches, oils and gummies, though only peach flavored. The use of raw plant material is not allowed.

(Courtesy/ Department of Energy and Environmental Protection)An undeveloped, 643-acre property bordering Rhode Island that includes four lakes in the town of Killingly was purchased recently by the state of Connecticut to be turned into public lands, officials announced Tuesday.
The land purchase — said to be one of the largest carried out by the state in recent years — was completed by the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection for $4.1 million, according to a press release.
The agency said it plans to add the property to its list of of more than 100 wildlife management areas that are open to the public. No name had been chosen for the site as of Tuesday.
“This acquisition is a landmark achievement for environmental conservation in Connecticut,” DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes said in a statement. “The new wildlife management area will not only protect vital ecosystems and water resources but also provide a serene space for the public to connect with nature through activities like wildlife watching and fishing.”
A spokesman for the agency said Tuesday that officials also plan to permit some hunting, pending a formal assessment of the property.
The property includes the 41-acre Lake Albert and three smaller lakes, as well as areas of forest and wetlands that are home to a “rich array of plant and animal species,” according to DEEP.
A listing on Zillow from January advertises the property for its “absolute peace, quiet and security with no public access.” The original listing price was $5.9 million.
The seller, Watertown developer Mark Greenberg, said he purchased the property in 1989 without any firm ideas of what he wanted to do with it. Later, he said he got local approval to build a sub-development of over 100 homes, only to find the cost of building the necessary roads and other infrastructure too prohibitive.
“Looking back, I wish I had not purchased it, it was not a good purchase for me,” he said.
After putting the property up for sale, Greenberg said the state reached out eight or nine months ago with a strong interest in purchasing the land, which he called a “wonderful” spot for its natural amenities. Ultimately, he said DEEP agreed to purchase the land for its appraisal price.
James Fowler, the DEEP spokesman, said Tuesday that the property had not previously been designated as open space and that its preservation “represents meaningful progress” toward achieving the state’s goal of setting aside 21% of its land — about 673,210 acres — as open space.
By law, that goal was supposed to have been reached by 2023. As of that year, however, DEEP reported it was only three-quarters of the way along.
According to CT Insider, the sale amounted to the single largest conveyance of land in Connecticut over the last three years — beating out an estate in Cornwall that was purchased last year.

Republican lawmakers sponsoring the bills stood outside the Capitol in the morning, joined by Payton McNabb, a former North Carolina high school athlete who said in 2022 she sustained a traumatic brain injury and other permanent injuries during a highschool volleyball game after a transgender athlete spiked the ball into her head.
President Donald Trump acknowledged McNabb, 20, at his joint address to Congress in March touting his executive order threatening to revoke federal money from educational institutions allowing transgender female athletes to compete on female sports teams.
“Biology is not bigotry,” McNabb said, contending that every adult who allowed a transgender girl onto the girls volleyball team failed her and denied the reality that there is a difference between the athletic ability of male and female athletes.

“It is not loving to lie and a man can just simply never become a woman no matter how many surgeries, what kind of clothes they’re putting on, it’s just not going to work,” McNabb said. “I’ve decided to try to use my story and turn pain into purpose and hopefully hope or use my story to make sure that this does not happen to any other girl across the nation.”
According to GLAAD, McNabb is a paid spokesperson for the Independent Women’s Forum, a group “that aggressively lobbies against transgender people”.
House Bills 4469 and 4066 dictate that schools must designate sports teams based on the sex listed on an athlete’s original birth certificate from the time they were born. The legislation would ban schools and districts from allowing “individuals of the male sex to participate in any interscholastic athletic team or sport designated as only for participants of the female sex”.
In order to safeguard the “integrity” of women’s sports, ensuring that girls don’t have to compete against “biological males”, bill sponsor Rep. Rylee Linting (R-Wyandotte) said there needs to be consistency in definitions for sports participation.
“This is not about putting anyone down. This is about lifting up our young girls who have dreams, making sure that they have a level playing field, that they are not robbed of scholarship opportunities, a spot on the team, or worse, seriously injured,” Linting said.
LGBTQ+ advocates condemn House resolution asking to bar transgender girls from high school sports

Earlier Thursday morning Linting and proponents for the bills, including anti-trans athlete advocate and former NCAA swimmer for the University of Kentucky Riley Gaines, who pre-recorded her testimony, advocated in the House Government Operations Committee for an amendment to Michigan’s Elliott-Larsen Civil Right Act specifying schools can base sports eligibility based on sex markers on original birth certificates.
If the sponsors of the bills are so interested in the health and safety of women and girls, they ought to look at actual issues impacting their safety like gun violence, housing affordability or food insecurity, Emme Zanotti, senior director of movement building and political affairs at Equality Michigan said during the committee meeting.
Sports are bigger than trophies, Zanotti told lawmakers during the committee meeting. Whether kids finish in first place or tie for fifth place, athletes learn important values such as perseverance and teamwork.

“We should want more young people to play sports in our state, not put up more barriers for all girls, like invasive inspections and ridicule about what gender they are because their hair is too short, they’re too tall, their shoulders are too broad, or because they have a good serve,” Zanotti said.
As a transgender woman and a coach to trangender athletes, Sarah Antaya  told lawmakers on the committee kids aren’t necessarily going to remember every trophy or medal they didn’t win, but the bullying and discrimination they face when trying to participate in sports, to have fun like all the other kids, will have an effect.
The vast majority of children in sports are not going to get a scholarship or become professional athletes, Antaya said, and coming from a hockey and roller derby background, she said the majority of injuries in sports aren’t in totality due to an opponent being “grossly physically superior”.
“The vast majority of injuries happen because injuries happen. It’s sports, and to say that we need to protect these kids from other girls is just a false narrative,” Antaya said. “These bills are simply taking away opportunities from kids who are just trying to be themselves, who are just trying to live, who just want to play the sports they’ve grown up loving, and be a part of the team with their peers that they’ve grown up with.”
The bills cleared the all male-member committee with no support from Democrats.

(Courtesy photo)Three years, $2,000 in civil and criminal fines, and a trio of misdemeanor charges later, a former state Senate candidate finally turned in her overdue campaign finance reports, the Rhode Island Board of Elections announced Wednesday.
The resolution comes after Jennifer Douglas, a Charlestown Democrat, provided the state elections panel with seven missing campaign finance reports spanning 2021 to 2022. Douglas turned in the paperwork on Friday, May 9, a day after entering a no contest plea in Rhode Island District Court on three criminal misdemeanor charges of violating campaign finance laws, according to public court records.
Douglas in an interview Thursday said she failed to keep up with the paperwork due to a loss in her personal life.
“I went through a very difficult time and was only concentrating on my kids and myself,” Douglas said. “Things just got away from me.”
She emphasized that failure to file reports was different from misuse of campaign funds. 
“My campaign finances are to the penny right now,” Douglas said. “It wasn’t like I stole campaign funds, it was simply bad accounting, and a failure to do my due diligence.”
She added, “I was wrong. It played out the way it should have.”
Douglas, who was backed by the progressive Rhode Island Political Cooperative, failed to unseat Republican Sen. Elaine Morgan for the Senate District 34 seat in the 2018, 2020, and 2022 elections.
The Board of Elections referred Douglas’ case to the Rhode Island Office of the Attorney General in July 2023, after it was unable to resolve the problems with her campaign finance reports solely through civil fines. The AG then referred the case to Rhode Island State Police, which charged Douglas in December 2024 with three counts of criminal misdemeanor charges for failing to report campaign donations and expenses. 
Douglas was fined $1,100 on May 8 after entering her plea in Rhode Island 3rd Division District Court in Warwick, according to the public court docket. 
Of her no contest plea, Douglas said, “I just wanted it to be over.”
Typically, candidates who flout campaign finance rules are able to work out the problems directly with the elections board through a consent agreement and some type of financial penalty. 
Douglas first ran afoul of campaign reporting rules in 2021. She agreed to pay a $1,200 fine after the elections board found she failed to disclose a combined $4,600 in campaign donations and spending from her 2020 run for the same seat.
But the problems persisted. Following the November 2021 agreement, Douglas failed to file the next seven regular campaign finance reports, spanning the fourth quarter of 2021 to 2022. A 2021 report submitted five months late also showed a $54 discrepancy not accounted for in her receipts. 
Attempts to contact Douglas — an elections panel audit report documents 18 emails, multiple voicemails and one successful phone conversation — yielded no progress in fixing the unaccounted for money or supplying the past-due reports.
The elections board voted in April 2023 to order Douglas to appear before them to explain why they should not hold her in contempt. But she never showed, nor did she supply the missing campaign documents. In June, the board voted to hold her in contempt, imposing a $1,000 fine. That penalty was paid in April 2024, Christopher Hunter, a board spokesperson, said via email. 
However, she still owes more than $1,100 in court fees and fines for the criminal misdemeanor charges, which have been set on a payment plan, according to court documents. Douglas said she plans to pay the full amount Friday.
Douglas said she has no plans to run for office again.
“No thank you,” she said Thursday.

(Photo: Wichayada Suwanachun/Getty Images)One legislator is pushing to explore the possibility of a publicly funded universal health care system for Maine, which would expand coverage to more than 59,000 currently uninsured residents.
During a public hearing on Wednesday, proponents stressed the urgent need for a better health care system, though the state’s affordable health care office said there is “no path forward” for establishing such a program right now.
One bill, LD 1269, proposes a comprehensive study to analyze the costs and feasibility of a universal health care plan. Another, LD 1883, offers a detailed blueprint for a state-wide system called the All Maine Health Program that would provide comprehensive coverage to all Maine residents.
If passed, Maine would be the only state in the country to shift to a universal health care system. 
During the hearing before the Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial Services Committee, Rep. AnnMarie Mastraccio (D-Sanford), who introduced both bills, said a state-wide system has not been studied comprehensively since 2002, and that “it’s time to update those numbers and evaluate our options.”
She is aiming to address rising health care challenges including the closure of hospitals in rural Maine, the uncertainty around Medicaid funding, and overall health care costs increasing. Mainers spend more than $18.5 billion annually on health care, nearly 20% of the state’s Gross Domestic Product, she said.
“Maine’s current health care system is fragmented, inefficient and economically unsustainable,” Mastraccio said.“As legislators, we have a responsibility to make data-driven decisions that promote a sustainable, equitable health care infrastructure that begins with understanding the true costs and potential savings of a universal, publicly funded system.”
Dozens of health care providers, advocates and Mainers who have struggled with medical costs testified in support of the bills, highlighting the urgent need for reform. They pointed to the lack of access to providers in rural areas, racial disparities in health care access in the state and the financial strain on both patients and providers because of the patchwork system of insurance coverage.  
“The burden of this poor health infrastructure falls disproportionately on women of color, Black and Indigenous women and low income and rurally located women,” said Lily James, advocacy coordinator for the Maine Women’s Lobby.
For example, 65% of pregnant Black Mainers receive adequate prenatal care in 2022, compared to 87% of white Mainers, according to Maine Department of Health and Human Services data. And 22% of pregnant Mainers have to travel more than 45 minutes to access a birthing hospital, according to a 2023 report that James cited. 
“The All Maine Health Program would be life changing, and in many cases, life saving for so many Mainers and will pave the way for the desperately needed changes to Maine’s health care infrastructure,” James said. 
A November 2024 report from the Maine Center for Economic Policy found that, based on current demographics and insurance coverage, the cost of such a program would roughly equal the amount Mainers spend now, between $17.8 and $19.3 billion. 
Testifying on behalf of the plan, James Myall, a policy analyst for MECEP who authored the report, said that, unlike the current system, the cost of a universal system could be offset by other revenue streams, such as federal grants or increasing taxes on the wealthiest Mainers. 
“This means that most Mainers will pay less under the proposed plan than under the status quo, while also being free of the stresses that come from being unable to afford copays and deductibles, worrying about in-network coverage, or switching insurance providers,” he told lawmakers. 
State argues bill not currently feasible
Meg Garratt-Reed, director of Maine’s Office of Affordable Health Care, which was established by the Legislature in 2021,  testified against both bills, saying the state isn’t in a position to implement them with the current financial constraints and the amount of change that would be required to implement the program. While she acknowledged that Maine’s health system is flawed and praised the intent behind the bills, she said a single-payer program would be too costly and complex to set up right now.
The All Maine Health Program aims to save money by removing insurance companies from the system, which would reduce administrative costs like billing as well as shareholder profits. But Garratt-Reed said those savings wouldn’t be enough to offset the added expenses in the plan. The bills would expand what’s covered, increase payments to providers, and do less to limit unnecessary or overly costly treatments — all of which would drive up overall spending.
She also said the bills would move away from the current cost-control system used by Medicare and MaineCare, Maine’s Medicaid system, which set fixed prices for services. Instead, the state would have to negotiate rates with each provider — a more complex and less efficient process that could lead to even higher costs.
The proposal also relies on using federal money (such as Medicaid and Medicare funds) to pay for the new system — but federal law doesn’t let states reallocate money designated for specific programs without special permission, she said. And the federal government is very unlikely to give that permission, Garratt-Reed said, especially under the current political situation, pointing to congressional Republicans’ proposal to drastically cut Medicaid funding. 
“I think we can all agree that our current health care system is flawed, and that many people suffer because of those flaws. However much we may wish that we could recreate our nation’s health care system from the ground up, we have a responsibility to those people to pursue solutions that have real potential to ease their suffering,” she said. 
“The reality is there is no path forward for implementing such a program in Maine now or in the immediate future.”

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderGeorgia Senate Majority Leader Steve Gooch is looking to become the state’s next lieutenant governor. Gooch announced his campaign for the November, 2026 race with a press release Wednesday.
“I’m running for Lieutenant Governor because Georgia deserves bold leadership that will stand up to the insanity of the Democrat Party, protect our families from the invasion of criminal illegal aliens and keep our economy vibrant and strong,” he said in the release. “I see a Georgia that is the gold standard for our great country — a state that leads the way in securing our borders, stopping violent crime, abolishing the state income tax and defending the values that make America great.”
The Dahlonega Republican has served in the Senate since 2010 and was elected majority leader in 2022. He owns a private environmental services company in Dahlonega.
The lieutenant governor is elected on a separate ticket from the governor and presides over the state Senate.

In his announcement, Gooch calls himself a “die-hard MAGA supporter,” a “MAGA champion” and a “consistent and vocal supporter of President Donald Trump” who is “unapologetically pro-life, pro-Second Amendment and pro-school choice” and will “proudly stand with President Trump and will continue fighting to restore the greatness of our country.”
Earlier this year, Gooch was lead sponsor of a bill creating a Georgia license plate stamped with “America First,” a slogan used by Trump. The bill was recently signed by Gov. Brian Kemp.
The same American flag design on the license plate tops his campaign website and the letterhead for his press release.
Gooch’s only declared Democratic rival, Sandy Springs state Sen. Josh McLaurin, scoffed at the focus on the White House occupant.

“The Majority Leader appears to have made his MAGA license plate bill the centerpiece of his campaign launch. I think that choice makes the point about how the GOP primary is going to go: it’s going to be about who can suck up the most to Trump,” he said.
The GOP primary could be a crowded race, with several powerful Senate Republicans reportedly considering runs.
Senate President Pro Tem John Kennedy of Macon, Sen. Blake Tillery of Vidalia and Sen. Greg Dolezal of Cumming are rumored to be on the list of potential candidates. Any candidate will likely face pressure to appear maximally conservative in a party primary likely to attract the most committed Republican voters.
The current lieutenant governor, Jackson Republican Burt Jones, could run for re-election, but with Kemp approaching his term limit, Jones is widely expected to launch a campaign for governor. If he does, he’ll join a slate of candidates that is likely to expand but for now includes Republican Attorney General Chris Carr and Atlanta Democratic Sen. Jason Esteves.

Ron DeSantis said Thursday that he plans to veto a bill championed for years by victims of medical malpractice who are blocked from suing doctors and hospitals they claim are responsible for the deaths of family members.
DeSantis, however, contended that eliminating the law that prevents people from suing physicians and hospitals for noneconomic damages would cause medical malpractice premiums to “skyrocket.”
Specifically, HB 6017 lifts a longstanding provision of Florida law that bans parents of single, childless, adult children and adult children of single parents from suing hospitals and physicians if alleged malpractice resulted in death.
The law defines adults as 25 and older.
“What that is going to do is, that’s going to lead to a flood of lawsuits against practitioners and against hospitals. Malpractice premiums are going to go up. It’s going to be harder to recruit physicians into Florida, and ultimately, health care costs will go up,” DeSantis said when asked whether he would sign the bill into law. 
The governor still has not received the legislation. Once he does, he’ll have 15 days to veto it, sign  it, or allow it to become law without his signature.
The decision to veto the legislation is a stinging defeat for family members who trekked this year to the Capitol to share stories about what they called the “free kill” law.  The bill was opposed by business interests, organized medicine, and hospitals across the state, worried about a flood of new lawsuits including some from estranged children who don’t live in Florida and haven’t seen their family members in years.
House, Senate panels OK bills to revamp Florida’s medical malpractice laws

Lobbyist scolded for ‘scare tactics’ in committee debate on wrongful-death bill

The Legislature overwhelmingly approved the law, above the threshold needed to override a veto. Those who supported the legislation spoke of the need to hold doctors and health care providers accountable if they make a fatal mistake.
Damages limits
DeSantis said he “suggested” to the Legislature that it place caps on the amount of non-economic damages people could recover, not only for the new lawsuits allowed under HB 6017, but for all medical malpractice cases. DeSantis noted that “there was some support of it in the Senate.” He was referencing the Senate’s razor-thin vote at the end of the session to reject the caps.
“If you had caps on the amount of damages, people could see that would disincentivize a lot of jackpot justice,” DeSantis said.
The governor said he had spoken with “lots of folks in health care,” including hospital and physician associations that oppose the bill.
“I mean, it was pretty overwhelming in terms of the concern, you know, that they had on it. If there were caps on that, then it would probably be something that people would be able to live with.”
  House Speaker Daniel Perez via the Florida House
HB 6017 has been a priority for House Speaker Daniel Perez, who has been at odds with DeSantis over state spending levels and tax relief, among other things.
The ban was initially passed in the 1990s as the state wrestled with rising malpractice premiums. But there has been a concerted effort in recent years, to eliminate the ban. That push has coincided with recent efforts by organized medicine, business, and insurance lobbyists to reinstate caps on pain and suffering in all medical malpractice lawsuits.
Florida had previously passed caps on noneconomic damages in medical malpractice cases but the Florida Supreme Court in 2017 ruled them unconstitutional.
DeSantis on Thursday described the 2017 court as “liberal.”
“I don’t think this current court would reach the same conclusion,” he said.
DeSantis, who has been harshly critical of the trial bar and Speaker Perez, said he’s aware of the families who appeared throughout the 2025 session to share their stories about how their family and loved ones died.
“I know there have been people that have been victimized, have family members, and it’s a really, really sad thing, but I also know you have to look at the global view of what is it going to do for the overall access to care prices, the willingness of physicians to come here. And that was very clear to me in speaking with folks,” the governor said.

(West Virginia Office of Gov. Patrick Morrisey | Courtesy photo)Gov. Patrick Morrisey on Thursday ceremonially signed a piece of legislation that will change statewide standards for plugging abandoned and orphaned oil and natural gas wells across West Virginia.
House Bill 3336 allows abandoned and orphaned wells in the state to be plugged by piercing the casing of the well and filling it with cement instead of removing the entire infrastructure of the well, which was previously required under state law. 
The bill passed the state House of Delegates 94-1 with five members absent and not voting. With one member absent, the state Senate unanimously adopted the bill on April 11, sending it to Morrisey’s desk for signature.
The new methods for plugging wells will give the state Department of Environmental Protection more “flexibility to adapt to real-world conditions,” said DEP Secretary Harold Ward. The method has been “successfully tested in the field” under a pilot project run by the DEP, according to a news release. Officials at Thursday’s briefing said they’re hopeful that enacting a less burdensome plugging method will allow wells to be plugged quicker using less money.
Ward said there are more than 21,000 abandoned and orphaned wells in the state of West Virginia that can pose varying levels of environmental or health risks for the people and communities near them. Because they are abandoned — meaning the operators have left them and it’s unknown who is responsible for them — the state is on the hook to plug the oil and natural gas wells.
But plugging wells has proven a challenge across West Virginia. For one, the work is expensive. According to the abandoned well mapping tool from the DEP, the cost of plugging each well varies, but generally comes in near or above $100,000.
A majority of wells plugged in the state are paid for using federal dollars allocated over recent years, specifically through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act in 2021 and the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022. Per the DEP, both of those federal programs — passed and allocated under former President Joe Biden — are a “significant boon” for the state’s attempts to identify and plug abandoned wells as they provide “substantial” funding to West Virginia that is “crucial” to supporting the state Office of Oil and Gas. 
State funds — allocated to the OOG through industry permit fees, bond forfeitures and severance taxes — also go toward plugging wells, but on a smaller scale. State money covered plugging 18 abandoned wells in 2023 and about 32 in 2024, per the DEP.
Meanwhile, federal funds covered plugging more than 200 abandoned or orphaned wells in 2023 and 2024 respectively. If the federal funding from the IIJA remains active and available, it’s estimated that the state will be able to plug at least 1,200 abandoned wells through 2030.
On Thursday, Morrisey praised the passage of HB 3336, saying it will “protect West Virginia’s natural resources and unique environment.” The law will go into effect on July 5.
“This new law cuts unnecessary regulation, safeguards our ecosystem, and saves taxpayer dollars,” Morrisey said.

Ball’s lawsuit, among other things, asks the court to declare that, “to abide by their constitutional duty to execute the law, Governor Beshear and CHFS must do what it takes to execute all of the General Assembly’s laws using the funding they have.” 
Norma Hatfield, who is raising two grandchildren and is a longtime advocate for kinship care families in Kentucky, is “thrilled” by Ball’s lawsuit.  
“I’ve been waiting for somebody to do something. It’s just been extremely frustrating,” Hatfield told the Lantern. “I am just thrilled that she’s taken this on for these kinship families.” 
Ball said in a statement that the suit is “about doing what is right for Kentucky’s most vulnerable children and their caregivers. They deserve transparency, accountability, and meaningful action.” 
The Lantern has asked Beshear’s office and the cabinet for comment. 
‘Tortured reading’ of the law  
CHFS officials said it would cost $20 million to implement the law, which was not appropriated by the General Assembly when it passed. Lawmakers have criticized the administration for not finding the money in its existing budget. 
While the law has remained in limbo many Kentuckians raising minor relatives must make do without the level of government assistance that foster families receive.
The Beshear administration has cited the state Constitution and two court cases, including a 2005 state Supreme Court decision, that it says precludes the executive branch from spending money the legislature has not appropriated. 
In her Thursday lawsuit, Ball calls Beshear’s interpretation of that case, Fletcher v. Commonwealth, a “tortured reading” of the law. 
“As the policymaking body and holder of the power of the purse that determines the proper level of funding to give state agencies to carry out the Commonwealth’s laws, the General Assembly says that Governor Beshear and CHFS have more than enough money to carry out SB 151 and must do so,” the lawsuit says. 
‘Flabbergasted:’ Help for kinship care families passed unanimously. $20M price tag could derail it.

The legislature enacted a new two-year state budget this year but took no action to appropriate the money the Beshear administration insists is needed. 
An estimated 59,000 Kentucky children are in what’s commonly called kinship care. Research shows that staying with family has better outcomes for children, but government financial support for kinship care has been lacking in part because caregivers make an important decision hastily, under stress and without all the information they need.
When the state removes a child from a home, grandparents and other family members often choose to take temporary custody rather than have the child go into state custody. State custody is the first step toward foster care. 
That first decision is permanent under current law which has excluded kinship caregivers who take temporary custody from ever receiving the $750 a month that foster parents receive for each child. 
Still crusading for ‘kinship care’ families

Hatfield hopes this lawsuit can settle the debate over the 2005 Supreme Court decision for good, she said. 
“If the cabinet and the governor are going to keep citing this, and the legislature doesn’t agree with the interpretation that the cabinet and the governor’s making, then we are going to have this problem in the future,” she said. 
Lawsuit cites ‘blatant disregard’ of Constitution 
In October, Ball’s office announced an inquiry into the issue aimed at discovering what funds, if any, the cabinet could use to implement the law. 
In her lawsuit, Ball says the Beshear administration officials “refuse to even cooperate” with the inquiry, using the same logic used to not implement SB151. 
“To rectify this blatant disregard of their constitutional duty and their obstruction of the (Auditor of Public Account’s) investigatory authority — obstruction that, to the APA’s knowledge, no governor or executive branch agency has ever committed in the history of the Commonwealth — the APA is here to ask this court to remind Governor Beshear and CHFS of their constitutional duty to execute and obey the law,” the lawsuit states. 
The impasse between the Democratic governor and Republican legislature on this issue sends just one message to Hatfield, she said: “I see them saying, ‘I won’t move one inch, even though grandma’s losing thousands of dollars for that child. I’m not moving one inch.’” 
That’s “shameful,” she said. 
“Politically, isn’t it better in the long run to show that you’ve stepped in for that grandmother, you’ve stepped in for that child, and you have a success story?” Hatfield asked. “Instead of putting up a barrier saying, ‘I am right and I do nothing’?”

Gabe Vasquez speaks in Las Cruces following a mass shooting on March 23, 2025 in Las Cruces that left three dead and 15 injured. (Leah Romero / Source NM)Southern New Mexico’s representative in the U.S. House of Representatives said Thursday he is introducing updated legislation intended to require federal immigration authorities to report their activities to Congress.
U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez (D-N.M.) held a news conference on Thursday alongside two community organizations to discuss what he called the “Humane Accountability Act 2.0,” which would require the federal Department of Homeland Security to report to Congress all immigration detentions, removals and encounters that have occurred since January.
Vasquez said the new version of the bill is updated to “reflect the times that we’re in today,” specifically the U.S. government deporting people to foreign countries. He said the legislation would require DHS to report, with legal justifications, each detention, removal or transfer to “non-traditional sites” like the Terrorism Confinement Center in El Salvador or the U.S. military base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
The bill also blocks surprise detentions at military bases, on tribal lands or overseas sites, requiring advanced notice with justification, including costs and care standards, he said.
The legislation would also mandate DHS to report on conditions in immigration detention centers for issues such as assaults, abuse, hospitalization and death, Vasquez said, along with complaints from detained people about access to legal representation or retaliation.
The congressman was joined by Lan Sena, policy director for the Center for Civic Policy, and Casey Mangan, a lawyer with the New Mexico Immigrant Law Center’s detention and asylum team.
Mangan said all three of New Mexico’s ICE detention facilities – the Otero County Processing Center, the Cibola County Correctional Center and the Torrance County Detention Facility — are full.
“On top of worsening conditions in the facilities, we’re seeing families and communities ripped apart by large-scale deportations, jamming people through the process without any due process,” he said.
Vasquez said detention centers like the one in Torrance County have shown substandard care for the people they hold, “and DHS has to be held accountable, as well as the private prison corporations that operate these centers.”
“Due process, transparency and accountability are not optional in a democracy,” Vasquez said.
Vasquez said seven people have died while in the custody of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement since January. He said the agency is detaining more than 52,000 people, far above its 41,500-person capacity, and is on track to spend more than Congress has allowed.
Mangan said not much has changed as a result of his organization’s and the federal government’s own documentation of abuses, neglect and deaths caused by ICE negligence in New Mexico.
“If anything, things have gotten worse,” Mangan said. “There’s a reason for that: Under current state law, these facilities operate without state oversight and functionally without any federal oversight.”
Sena, the daughter of Vietnamese refugees, noted that May is Asian American, Pacific Islander and Native Hawaiian Heritage Month and said she is reminded of the deep history of injustices against immigrants in the U.S.
“Now, our community is facing dire threats as we are being detained without due process, nor receiving proper notification or information in their own languages, and potentially being sent to countries they have never lived in nor citizens of,” Sena said.
Sena said Vasquez’s legislation “shines a light on the darkest corners of our immigration system, and demands accountability from those in power,” and urged Congress to pass it.
Vasquez said he has very little faith that the Trump administration would sign the bill into law in the event Congress does pass it, but he will keep introducing it.
Mangan said the bill would be an important step toward guaranteeing the due process everyone has under the U.S. constitution, including migrants.
“Now, more than ever, we need to enforce the rule of law and support the important power that Congress has to provide a check on executive power,” he said.

(Photo by Stephanie Keith/Getty Images)Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, who was arrested by federal agents last week and accused of trespassing at an immigration jail in his city, said Thursday that the case against him is an attack on due process and the rule of law.
Baraka, speaking to supporters outside a Newark federal courthouse where lawyers had just concluded a 20-minute status conference in his case, called his prosecution a political act by the Trump administration.
“We cannot arrest people simply because they disagree with us. We cannot target people because their political views are separate from ours. We cannot subjugate people, take their pictures, mugshots, and fingerprints because we believe that, somehow, they’re opposed to our positions,” said Baraka. “That, ladies and gentlemen, is authoritarianism.”
Baraka, one of six Democrats vying for their party’s nomination for governor on June 10, could face a July trial over the trespassing charge, lawyers in court said Thursday.
Federal authorities arrested Baraka on Friday at the migrant jail, called Delaney Hall, alleging he trespassed on the property. Rahul Agarwal, an attorney for the mayor, noted in court Thursday that video footage shows facility staff opening a gate to let Baraka into a fenced-off parking lot. Baraka was outside the property when federal authorities arrested him, Agarwal said.
“We believe the mayor was targeted,” Agarwal told U.S. Magistrate Judge André M. Espinosa.
The Department of Homeland Security has claimed that Baraka and a group including three sitting members of Congress “stormed the gate and broke into” the jail property as a bus carrying detainees entered the facility.
“We believe there’s clear evidence the mayor was on the property” and was asked to leave, federal prosecutor Stephen Demanovich said.
Baraka attorney Raymond Brown scoffed at the idea that his client stormed the property, citing the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol.
“That’s storming,” Brown said. “He didn’t do it.”
Acting U.S. Attorney Alina Habba, who last week trumpeted Baraka’s arrest as proof that “no one is above the law,” attended Thursday’s conference but did not make comments in court.
The defense, which signaled it would seek to dismiss the case on grounds of selective prosecution and jurisdictional infirmity, is seeking the identity of the person who they say invited Baraka onto the property.
The city has sued Delaney Hall’s private operator, GEO Group, alleging it failed to secure proper city permits before reopening the facility. GEO Group has said it complied with local rules. Baraka and other Newark officials visited the jail multiple times last week before his arrest to demand to inspect the facility.
Baraka’s attorneys said they had yet to receive any documents related to his arrest from prosecutors and requested that the judge require the prosecution to provide all relevant materials by next Thursday.
“We would like to see that evidence,” Agarwal said.
Espinosa did not immediately set a firm trial date due to staffing and other issues. He said, and both parties agreed, the charge does not require a jury trial, though Baraka’s counsel team reserved the right to seek one.
The trespass charge Newark’s three-term mayor faces is a misdemeanor that carries penalties of between five and 30 days’ imprisonment and fines of not more than $5,000.

SPRINGFIELD – House Speaker Emanuel “Chris” Welch made the extraordinary move of removing an appropriations committee chair on Wednesday with two weeks left in the legislative session and a tightening fiscal landscape.

Speaking exclusively to Capitol News Illinois on Thursday, Welch, D-Hillside, said he removed Rep. Fred Crespo, D-Hoffman Estates, from the Democratic caucus as well for lack of communication with caucus leaders.

Crespo has become a voice of dissent in the Democratic caucus against growing spending by the state, imploring fellow lawmakers to exercise fiscal restraint and not look to taxpayers to plug budget holes.

While he voted for the fiscal year 2025 budget last May, he was one of several Democrats to withhold their votes on a corresponding revenue package, helping to set up an all-night scramble for Welch’s House leaders to make sure the measure had enough votes to pass.

Welch told Jak Tichenor, host of the “Illinois Lawmakers” program, that he implemented new processes for communicating with leadership about the budget this year and Crespo “chose not to be a part of those processes and to go on his own” as lawmakers work toward a May 31 deadline to pass the budget.

“The breaking point was as an appointed chair of one of my appropriations committees, not communicating with the chief of staff, not communicating with the lead budgeteer – Leader (Robyn) Gabel – (and) not communicating with me as the speaker,” Welch said.

Crespo declined to comment immediately on Welch’s decision. He has represented northwest Cook County in the House since 2007 and was the chair of the House Appropriations-General Services Committee until Wednesday. The committee meets with various state agencies to hear budget requests.

Crespo’s excommunication from the caucus means he is barred from private meetings among House Democrats.

Brady Burden, a staff member on the committee who was also placed on administrative leave for an undisclosed reason, told Capitol News Illinois he worked with Crespo to put together some numbers on the budget to see where the state can save money. But Welch said his decision wasn’t because of Crespo’s independent exercise.

“If we're going to deliver things for the collective that's good for the state of Illinois, we have to follow processes,” Welch said. “And the chairman chose not to have any conversations with anyone, despite those processes calling for that.”

Gov. JB Pritzker told reporters Thursday he was aware of Welch’s decision but declined to say more.

Welch has implemented several changes this spring to processes in the House, including bringing on new top aides and revamping his budget leadership team with new members.

Burden argued he communicated Crespo’s activities to his superiors on House staff “to make sure that nobody was being blindsided by it.”

“There was a level of secrecy to the project, but I think the concern was more that it didn’t get leaked until there was a finished product,” he said.

Crespo’s expulsion is the second time in the last two years Welch has kicked a member out of the caucus. Welch removed former Rep. Mary Flowers, D-Chicago, from meetings in 2023 following allegedly disrespectful behavior toward staff members. Welch then backed a successful primary opponent against Flowers in 2023.

While he ultimately voted for the budget last May, Crespo rose on the House floor during debate over the bill to criticize leadership in his party for not considering spending restraints, such as hiring freezes and limiting appropriations to state agencies to 95% of the funds they asked for to force the agencies to lobby lawmakers for the other 5%.

Crespo warned the state faced a fiscal cliff if lawmakers continue to increase spending.

He’s continued those warnings this year, criticizing House Democratic colleagues who have proposed bills that would require new state appropriations.

“You can ask for everything, you can’t have it all,” Crespo said in April as the House debated a bill that would require the state to establish a program for student teachers to receive stipends, but didn’t include any funding.

“We need to start prioritizing what we want; and at the end of the day, taxpayers are going to pay for this,” he said. “And at this rate, we’re just going to run out of taxpayers’ dollars to spend.”

The revenue plan passed the House last year with the minimum 60 votes despite Democrats holding 78 seats in the chamber. Crespo told Capitol News Illinois earlier this year he feared the FY25 revenue enhancements that were enacted to close a roughly $900 million deficit would limit lawmakers’ options to increase revenue as they consider the FY26 budget.

However, he later praised Pritzker’s introduced budget as one of the best he has heard since joining the legislature, saying he was glad Pritzker told lawmakers they must come up with spending cuts to correspond to any spending increases they propose.

House Minority Leader Tony McCombie, R-Savanna, told Tichenor it is “really going to be a loss for the state of Illinois that he is no longer in those positions.”

Burden has been the leading voice of a House Democratic staff effort to create a legislative staff union. That is not currently authorized under state law, which previously prompted Welch to file legislation authorizing it. Burden and other staff members have filed a lawsuit seeking recognition under the state’s constitutional right to collective bargaining.

“That’s something I’ll be talking about with my counsel, about whether or not this is something that constitutes a form of retaliation,” Burden said.

The two new cases included an adult of unknown vaccination status and an unvaccinated child under the age of four.


Possible exposure in Sandoval County
Presbyterian Rust Hospital Emergency Department (2400 Unser Boulevard SE in Rio Rancho):
Wednesday, April 30 from noon – 5:30 p.m.
Sunday, May 11 from 7:30 a.m. – 1 p.m.

Saturday, May 10 from noon – 3 p.m.


DOH also reported several locations, days and times during which residents may have been exposed to measles.
“If you have been exposed to measles and are vaccinated, your risk of getting sick is low,” NMDOH Chief Medical Officer Dr. Miranda Durham said in a statement. “Watch for symptoms but know that the vaccine is very good at preventing measles.”
Measles symptoms begin with a cough, runny nose and eye redness, before progressing to fever and rash that starts at the head before moving down the body. Health officials advise that people who have measles can infect others from four days before the rash appears and remain contagious four days after the rash is gone.
With the new cases in Sandoval County, New Mexico now amassed 73 cases, with others in: Chaves, Curry, Doña Ana, Eddy and Lea counties. Currently, more than 1,000 measles cases have been reported nationwide, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The health department encourage people with symptoms who have been exposed to measles to call NMDOH Helpline at 1-833-SWNURSE (1-833-796-8773) for guidance in English and Spanish. If planning to see a doctor or visit an emergency room, call first so health care providers can plan for a visit by someone who may have measles.
Lastly, the Sandoval County Public Health Office (1500 Idalia Road NE in Bernalillo) offers the measles, mumps, rubella vaccination with no appointment necessary from 8:30 a.m to 11:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. Mondays – Thursdays. For more information call (505) 867-2291, extension 1707.

Read this story in English.
A ciertos inmigrantes en Connecticut se les ha impedido obtener una licencia de conducir que cumpla con los estándares federales de seguridad, conocida como REAL ID. Esto podría dificultarles viajar dentro del país ahora que han entrado en vigor nuevas regulaciones federales.
Según el Departamento de Vehículos Motorizados (DMV) del estado, solo los ciudadanos estadounidenses y los residentes permanentes pueden obtener el REAL ID.
Esto excluye a varios inmigrantes que viven en Connecticut, incluyendo refugiados, solicitantes de asilo, personas en libertad condicional humanitaria, personas que solicitan refugio o asilo, y beneficiarios de la Acción Diferida para los Llegados en la Infancia (DACA), según abogados de inmigración.
“Connecticut es más estricta que las leyes federales actuales”, declaró Dana Bucin, abogada de inmigración, en una mesa redonda reciente en el Capitolio. Según las regulaciones federales, estos grupos son elegibles para el REAL ID.
Bucin declaró al Connecticut Mirror que ella y varios otros abogados de inmigración de la sección estatal de la Asociación Americana de Abogados de Inmigración, han estado en conversaciones con el Departamento de Vehículos Motorizados durante los últimos dos años para lograr que la política estatal refleje las normas federales.
Sonia Castelan, residente de West Haven, comentó que a su novio, beneficiario de DACA, le informaron que no era elegible para el REAL ID cuando visitó el DMV el mes pasado.
Su novio, quien pidió no ser identificado por preocupaciones sobre su empleo, dijo que presentó los documentos necesarios que el DMV exige como prueba de su estatus legal, pero sin éxito. “Fue realmente desalentador, porque al menos esperaba algún tipo de aclaración”, dijo.
Castelan agregó: “La comunidad de DACA continúa enfrentando estos problemas del mundo real y sigue sufriendo discriminación”. Dijo que es “como una puñalada por la espalda”.
El Comisionado del Departamento de Vehículos Motorizados, Tony Guerrera, declaró que el DMV estaba trabajando para que los refugiados y las personas a quienes se les ha concedido asilo obtuvieran un REAL ID.
“Reconocemos la conveniencia que ofrece el REAL ID y estamos trabajando diligentemente para mejorar nuestros sistemas y adaptar esta opción a asilados y refugiados. El objetivo es que esta opción esté disponible en un futuro próximo”, se lee en el comunicado.
Guerrera indicó que las personas que viajan dentro del país aún pueden obtener autorización para volar utilizando documentos distintos al REAL ID, incluyendo una tarjeta de autorización de empleo o un pasaporte extranjero de su país de origen.
Sin embargo, Bucin señaló que los refugiados y solicitantes de asilo sin un REAL ID corren el riesgo de tener encuentros difíciles o desagradables en los aeropuertos.
Además, algunos inmigrantes aún tienen dificultades para obtener licencias de conducir regulares en Connecticut, señaló Jon Bauer, director de la Clínica de Asilo y Derechos Humanos de la Facultad de Derecho de la Universidad de Connecticut. Bauer señaló que la respuesta en las oficinas del DMV ha sido “inconsistente”.
“Hay que reconocerle al DMV que, cuando se les presentan casos particulares, han trabajado para corregirlos. Pero creo que con una orientación más clara y una mejor capacitación, algunos de estos problemas podrían evitarse desde el principio”, afirmó.
Bauer explicó que existen alternativas a la presentación de un REAL ID al abordar un avión, pero estas conllevan sus propios desafíos. Un pasaporte extranjero válido es un documento aceptable, explicó, pero los solicitantes de asilo y los refugiados que tuvieron que huir de sus países de origen podrían no tener uno.
“Muchas personas que huyeron de la persecución no pueden renovar sus pasaportes o no quieren lidiar con el gobierno de un país que los persiguió”, explicó.
Una tarjeta de autorización de trabajo emitida por el Departamento de Seguridad Nacional también debería ser aceptable, señaló, pero estas tarjetas a veces pueden tardar meses en llegar.
Bauer añadió que los inmigrantes con Estatus de Protección Temporal (TPS), o las personas que solicitan TPS o asilo, también son elegibles para un REAL ID según la ley federal. Pero esos estatus tienen fecha de vencimiento, lo que significa que el DMV tendría que emitir licencias con una validez limitada. Señaló que esto podría presentar dificultades logísticas.
Guerrera declaró que la agencia sabía que una licencia a corto plazo podría permitir que más personas calificaran para un REAL ID. Lo calificó como un área de enfoque importante para la agencia.
El abogado Chris Llinas, presidente del comité del Departamento de Vehículos Motorizados de CT AILA (Connecticut Immigration Lawyers Association), declaró a CT Mirror que el DMV implementó algunos cambios a principios del año pasado. Llinas indicó que la agencia acordó aceptar un documento de autorización de empleo como documento principal para quienes buscan obtener un REAL ID.
Tanto él como Bauer comentaron que el DMV había expresado su intención de que los refugiados y asilados fueran elegibles para un REAL ID, pero que hasta el momento, esto aún no ha sucedido.
“El progreso a veces ha sido frustrantemente lento, y tengo la esperanza de que muy, muy pronto implementarán el cambio para que las licencias REAL ID completas estén disponibles, no solo para las personas con ‘Green Cards’, sino también para las personas con estatus de asilo o refugiado”, dijo Bauer.
Llinas dijo que no creía que el DMV intentara impedir deliberadamente que las personas obtuvieran el REAL ID; comentó que la agencia siempre le había sido útil cuando acudía a ellos con casos individuales. Atribuyó los retrasos al tamaño de la agencia, a la naturaleza burocrática y a la dificultad de comprender la ley de inmigración.
“La ley de inmigración no se presta a la simplicidad”, dijo Llinas, y agregó que podría ser difícil para un empleado del DMV comprender las regulaciones.
El requisito de tener un REAL ID para cualquier vuelo nacional entró en vigor el 7 de mayo.
El novio de Castelán dijo que había visitado el DMV anticipando esa fecha límite, ya que a veces tiene que viajar por trabajo. Dijo que ahora prevé encontrarse con un proceso más incómodo y largo sin el REAL ID, que podría implicar una revisión adicional en el aeropuerto.
“Se espera que ahora viaje un poco más, y eso me ayudaría mucho, porque es un documento menos que tendría que presentar a la TSA (Administración de Seguridad en el Transporte)”, dijo.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Real_ID_AP_2016-1024x708.jpg,,,2025-05-15 16:07:51.945667

The pandemic isn’t the only reason.,Erica Meltzer | Chalkbeat,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/15/gender-gap-math-k12-education-pandemic/,A new study finds that gender gaps that had closed before COVID widened again after students returned to in-person learning.,"This story was originally published by Chalkbeat. Sign up for their newsletters at ckbe.at/newsletters
Girls had closed long-standing gender gaps in math test scores and were doing about as well as boys on standardized tests in the years leading up to the pandemic.
But the gender gap in math has come roaring back. And according to a new analysis from the testing and research organization NWEA, girls seem to have fallen further behind since students returned to in-person school.
NWEA also found that fewer girls were enrolling in algebra in eighth grade than before the pandemic. Because taking algebra in eighth grade sets students up to take calculus by the end of high school, it’s an important indicator of whether students will be able to pursue STEM fields in college and beyond.
The finding comes as most American students still have not recovered from the effects of disrupted pandemic learning and as the federal government is pulling back its support for research, particularly research that focuses on disparities.
The analysis draws from eighth grade scores on major international and national tests coupled with data from two million students who took NWEA’s MAP Growth Assessment.
The gender gap returned on the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study, or TIMSS, a test given every four years in 64 countries, and on the National Assessment of Educational Progress, or NAEP, a test often referred to as the nation’s report card.
Among eighth graders who took NWEA’s assessments, boys did better than girls in math.
“All these indicators that we’re seeing across these different tests, they’re giving flashing warning signs that there’s something big happening here,” said Megan Kuhfield, director of growth modeling and analytics at NWEA and lead author of the report.
A Wall Street Journal analysis of state test scores found similar trends.
NWEA’s analysis can’t explain why this is happening. Researchers and educators have tended to focus on the ways the pandemic affected girls differently than boys. Girls’ mental health suffered more, and older girls especially took on more responsibility at home, doing housework or caring for siblings when schools were closed.
“When I first started looking at this, I thought, ‘Well, COVID changed everything,’” Kuhfeld said. “When we started digging into it, the fact that the gaps really started to widen from 2022 to 2024 more so than from 2019 to 2022, made that theory less strong to me.”
By 2022, most students were back in school. And girls continue to outperform boys in reading.
“Maybe it’s less about these global impacts on girls’ mental health and more about the classroom dynamics with students and teachers,” Kuhfeld said.
NWEA found that the math gender gap was more pronounced for higher performing students, with boys scoring much higher than girls on average. Among the lowest performing students, girls did better than boys in both reading and math.
“There needs to be a focus in middle school on making sure girls who are potentially interested in science and math get support to stay on those trajectories,” she said. “At the same time, we can’t lose sight of the boys at the bottom who are struggling.”
Research has found that teachers tend to judge math mistakes more harshly among girls and students of color and are more likely to attribute those students’ errors to lack of innate ability. Teachers who believed that gender inequality was no longer a problem were especially likely to penalize female students’ work.
“What we are finding over and over again is that when there is a mistake, when the answer is not fully correct, teachers assume that girls don’t have the math ability, or they are less capable than boys,” said Yasemin Copur-Gencturk, an associate professor of teacher education at the University of Southern California who has studied bias in teacher perceptions. “So girls could be receiving more implicit messages about not belonging in math classrooms, or they don’t have the capacity to do the work.”
Copur-Gencturk, who was not involved in the NWEA study, said it’s frustrating to see the gender gap return, but she’s glad to see data highlighting the issue. “That could be the problem and the solution, to raise awareness that it is not a done deal,” she said.
At the same time, she’s concerned that deep cuts to federal education research, and in particular to studies that touch on issues such as implicit bias and gender, mean there will be less information about what works going forward.
Algebra enrollment could be a warning sign
Kuhfeld worries that today’s gaps will grow over time. NWEA also found that fewer girls are taking eighth grade algebra than before the pandemic, which could mean fewer girls pursuing STEM majors in college. Last year, 24% of eighth grade boys and girls enrolled in algebra in the schools NWEA surveyed, but before the pandemic, 26% of girls took algebra in middle school. Boys’ participation has stayed steady.
Last year’s eighth graders were in fourth grade when schools closed in spring 2020. The years when they should have mastered foundational skills like fractions — critical to understanding algebra — were deeply disrupted.
“Eighth grade achievement is a lagging indicator for elementary school math,” Kuhfeld said. “It might mean that they’re not as prepared academically. Absent of COVID and these big changes, there’s a whole class of girls who might have been academically prepared who were routed out of these things.”
Enrollment in eighth grade algebra has been declining for years, said Elizabeth Huffaker, a research fellow at Stanford University’s Graduate School of Education and author of a brief on algebra access and placement. Curriculum changes saw more algebra content incorporated into middle school integrated math courses, making it harder to move some students ahead earlier. And “algebra for all” policies have not had the results advocates hoped for.
Girls’ absolute decline in algebra enrollment is small, and other surveys find slightly higher enrollment. But Huffaker said the decline should serve as a warning sign, especially when coupled with test score declines that defy easy explanation.
States such as Texas and North Carolina have statewide initiatives to use test scores to place students in eighth grade algebra, she said. Historically such policies have helped more girls take algebra early, but if girls now are doing worse on tests, they could have the opposite effect.
Huffaker said she would not have predicted that the pandemic would have led to widening gaps between girls and boys, and the trend deserves more investigation.
Schools should consider multiple ways of determining whether students are ready for algebra, not just test scores, she said. Tutoring and summer programs could help some students who are close to qualifying be more prepared for algebra.
But ultimately, Huffaker said, the best way to improve test scores and algebra readiness for all students, including girls, would be to make sure they learn math well in elementary and early middle school.

(West Virginia Legislative Photography)The state school board is taking time to consider how it will move forward with Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s executive order to allow religious exemptions to vaccination requirements.
Nancy White, West Virginia Board of Education president, said Tuesday that the board wouldn’t take action at this time and would reconsider the issue at its next meeting in June. 
Morrisey issued an executive order mandating that public schools permit religious and philosophical exemptions to the state’s strict school immunization rules. 
He said his executive order must stand despite lawmakers’ declining to change the state’s school vaccine requirements. The House of Delegates voted 42-56 to kill a bill that would have implemented religious exemptions, and the state’s immunization rules remain intact.
“The board supports the state superintendents’ attempt to follow compulsory vaccination law and directs her to continue to work with the governor and with our legislative liaison to find resolution to this issue,” White said.
Numerous speakers urged board members to support the current vaccination laws during a measles outbreak. No one spoke in favor of religious exemptions to those requirements. 
Earlier this month, State Schools Superintendent Michele Blatt issued then rescinded a memo directing public schools to follow the state’s schools vaccination requirements that only permit medical exemptions under law. 
Morrisey has no intention of rescinding his executive order. He argues that the state’s “Equal Protection for Religion Act,” which went into law in 2023, gives his executive order legal authority. 
The questions about authority over vaccine laws come as preschoolers and kindergarten students are registering for the upcoming school year. Some private schools said they won’t comply with Morrisey’s order. Ohio County Schools hired a lawyer to weigh in on whether the school district should follow the governor’s vaccination executive order or the state’s current immunization requirements.
While appearing on MetroNews Talkline on Thursday, Blatt said there needs to be a statewide policy for vaccinations because a county-by-county basis would be difficult given the high volume of students who transfer during the school year.
“It’s important to note that our board of education decided that they’re eager to work in collaboration with the governor and with the Legislature, and, you know, a lot of things into consideration, as far as timelines with where we are in the school year,” Blatt said.
“And so most of our schools are wrapping up in the next few weeks. And so they thought it was important to give our executive and legislative branch a time to possibly work out their differences.”

Baraka appeared in federal court for a status conference on the Trump administration's charge that he trespassed last week at Delaney Hall, an ICE immigration detention center in Newark. (Photo by Stephanie Keith/Getty Images)Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, who was arrested by federal agents last week and accused of trespassing at an immigration jail in his city, said Thursday that the case against him is an attack on due process and the rule of law.
Baraka, speaking to supporters outside a Newark federal courthouse where lawyers had just concluded a 20-minute status conference in his case, called his prosecution a political act by the Trump administration.
“We cannot arrest people simply because they disagree with us. We cannot target people because their political views are separate from ours. We cannot subjugate people, take their pictures, mugshots, and fingerprints because we believe that, somehow, they’re opposed to our positions,” said Baraka. “That, ladies and gentlemen, is authoritarianism.”
Baraka, one of six Democrats vying for their party’s nomination for governor on June 10, could face a July trial over the trespassing charge, lawyers in court said Thursday.
Federal authorities arrested Baraka on Friday at the migrant jail, called Delaney Hall, alleging he trespassed on the property. Rahul Agarwal, an attorney for the mayor, noted in court Thursday that video footage shows facility staff opening a gate to let Baraka into a fenced-off parking lot. Baraka was outside the property when federal authorities arrested him, Agarwal said.
“We believe the mayor was targeted,” Agarwal told U.S. Magistrate Judge André M. Espinosa.
The Department of Homeland Security has claimed that Baraka and a group including three sitting members of Congress “stormed the gate and broke into” the jail property as a bus carrying detainees entered the facility.
“We believe there’s clear evidence the mayor was on the property” and was asked to leave, federal prosecutor Stephen Demanovich said.
Baraka attorney Raymond Brown scoffed at the idea that his client stormed the property, citing the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol.
“That’s storming,” Brown said. “He didn’t do it.”
Acting U.S. Attorney Alina Habba, who last week trumpeted Baraka’s arrest as proof that “no one is above the law,” attended Thursday’s conference but did not make comments in court.
The defense, which signaled it would seek to dismiss the case on grounds of selective prosecution and jurisdictional infirmity, is seeking the identity of the person who they say invited Baraka onto the property.
The city has sued Delaney Hall’s private operator, GEO Group, alleging it failed to secure proper city permits before reopening the facility. GEO Group has said it complied with local rules. Baraka and other Newark officials visited the jail multiple times last week before his arrest to demand to inspect the facility.
Baraka’s attorneys said they had yet to receive any documents related to his arrest from prosecutors and requested that the judge require the prosecution to provide all relevant materials by next Thursday.
“We would like to see that evidence,” Agarwal said.
Espinosa did not immediately set a firm trial date due to staffing and other issues. He said, and both parties agreed, the charge does not require a jury trial, though Baraka’s counsel team reserved the right to seek one.
The trespass charge Newark’s three-term mayor faces is a misdemeanor that carries penalties of between five and 30 days’ imprisonment and fines of not more than $5,000.

Yuan Lu, co-author of the findings published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), said there were disparities even within that 3%.
“Black, Hispanic, Asian patients were less likely to receive them compared to white patients,” she said. “People living in [a] rural area or [a] community with more social-economic challenges were less likely to be prescribed with this treatment.”
The class of medications called glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists are prescribed to treat Type 2 diabetes, a metabolic condition that increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. The injectable drugs include semaglutide (Ozemoic, Wegovy), and tirzepatide (Zepbound, Mounjaro).
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves the use of semaglutide and high-dose liraglutide (Saxenda) to help treat obesity, defined by a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher, according to the Cleveland Clinic.
Even though Zepbound is approved by the FDA for weight loss, its coverage by Medicare Part D is limited to treating diabetes.
Medicaid does not cover this class of weight loss drugs, and even private insurance offers limited coverage of the drugs for weight loss.
“The cost and the insurance coverage is the primary reason for people not getting this drug,” Lu said. “There is another part of the story. Even if the doctor prescribes it, you can imagine, because of the insurance, because of the cost issue, people come to the pharmacy, they find out it’s too high out-of-pocket cost, and they don’t fill the prescription.”
Lu said without insurance, the drugs cost between $1,000 to $1,500 per month.
Weight management beyond GLP-1 
A recently published review in the journal Obesity Reviews by Stamford Health found that significant weight is regained after stopping GLP-1 therapy, and the amount regained was proportional to the amount initially lost.
“For patients who have stopped GLP-1 drugs, it is recommended they continue to work with a health care provider to focus on sustainable dietary changes while also including regular physical activity,” said Suzanne J. Rose, executive director of research at Stamford Health.
“If patients have access to a registered dietician and personal trainer, they can work on formulating a plan that is maintainable,” she said. “In addition, it is important to include stress management as part of a healthy weight loss lifestyle.”
Rose said healthy coping mechanisms for stress include exercise, meditation, yoga, spending time in nature or engaging in hobbies.
She said patients should also consider joining a support group so they can connect with others who are going through similar experiences.
“Providers can encourage patients to be prepared for potential setbacks and have a plan in place to get back on track if they start to regain weight,” Rose said.

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)After forming a task force to make changes to its digital offerings, the University of Iowa has launched a new initiative to ensure its compliance with federal accessibility standards.
The UI announced the “Accessible Iowa: The Countdown to Digital Accessibility” initiative, a campus-wide drive to review all digital content and ensure the university is in line with changes to Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act.
According to a news release, public entities must come under compliance with the new rule, which states websites and other digital content must have accessible options and information for people with disabilities, by April 24, 2026.

“Meeting these digital accessibility standards is not just a legal obligation, but it’s the right thing to do,” said Tiffini Stevenson Earl, Office of Civil Rights Compliance senior director and ADA coordinator, in the release. “We are committed to giving all Hawkeyes access to the content and tools they need to succeed.”
The 15-member UI Accessibility Task Force, formed in December, is working to develop resources, training programs and policies to help better digital accessibility, according to the release.
Some work has already begun, according to the release, with the UI already having 65% of all online courses accessible through Anthology Ally, an accessibility tool.
Other goals of the initiative include finding and fixing accessibility issues in the university’s “most critical digital systems,” training all UI employees to utilize accessibility tools and practices when creating daily content and achieve at least a 94 accessibility score for all UI websites with SiteImprove, a website quality assurance program. The university currently has a score of 92.
The release stated these efforts align with more than just federal law, but the UI’s own 2022-2027 strategic plan, which includes removing barriers felt by students, staff and faculty with disabilities.
“This initiative is a major undertaking,” said Maggie Jesse, executive director of the Office of Teaching, Learning, and Technology and co-chair of the task force’s teaching committee, in the release. “With our combined efforts, we can create a more welcoming digital environment. The training and tools we’re developing will help everyone at UI play a part.”

Glenn Youngkin. (Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)The clerk of Virginia’s House of Delegates on Wednesday night rejected three of Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s recent vetoes in the state’s revised two-year budget. 
Acting within the clerk’s purview as Keeper of the Rolls, Paul Nardo published a letter on Virginia Legislative Information System that he would not  formally publish the vetoes because they are unconstitutional under Virginia’s constitution. 
The rejections blocked Youngkin’s vetoes of measures the legislature approved to expand access to weight-loss drugs in the state’s Medicaid program, to provide additional state and federal Medicaid reimbursements to nursing homes to bolster staff growth efforts, and to stop the state from issuing a contract to manage state employee health benefits on a contingency basis. 
In explaining he would not publish the vetoes, Nardo said that Youngkin had attempted to veto the provisions without also vetoing the budget appropriation that contained it. 
“Accordingly, I am duty-bound to not publish them,” he wrote as he cited constitutional law. 
Del. Rodney Willett, D-Henrico, who had carried the budget amendment for the weight-loss drug coverage, said Thursday he’s pleased the veto was rejected because the legislature had agreed for it to be appropriated. He also emphasized how the drugs can “save lives.”
Willett’s proposal stemmed from a recommendation by the rural health committee he chaired last year, which had toured the state to explore health disparities and solutions. Obesity has been a key contributing factor to health disparities — sometimes a result of other preexisting health conditions or a precursor to them, and sometimes being a side effect of living in areas with limited access to healthy foods and health care facilities. Weight-loss drugs can help people better manage their overall health, and prevent incurring additional health issues that could inflate  Medicaid costs down the line.
“It’s one of those win-wins,” Willett said in a call. “Because you’re going to save lives by getting people on that drug, but then also save money for the state.”
Virginia’s Supreme Court has previously defined an item in an appropriation bill like the state budget, for constitutional purposes, as an “indivisible sum of money dedicated to a stated purpose which may be eliminated from the bill without affecting the enactment’s other purposes or provisions.” 
Given that the vetoes were not recognized by Nardo, Willett thinks those appropriations should be implemented. 
Youngkin disagrees with that stance and plans for the executive branch to operate as if the vetoes stand, he told press at an unrelated bill signing on Thursday. 
Political analyst Stephen Farnsworth believes the dispute could “end up in the courts, like just about everything these days.”

Veterinarian Bradley Gordon of Altoona is charged by the Board of Pharmacy with failing to ensure physical security controls for controlled substances, failing to maintain accountability of controlled substances and related records, and failing to ensure inventory records included the drug strengths and dosages.
He’s also charged with failing to follow the rules for maintaining a perpetual inventory system for all Schedule II controlled substances, failing to ensure accountability of Schedule III through Schedule V controlled substances, failing to comply with the rules for disposing controlled substances, failing to create and maintain complete and accurate records, and committing acts that would render their Controlled Substances Act registration “inconsistent with the public interest.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The board has not disclosed when or where the alleged violations took place, nor has it disclosed any of alleged actions that led to the charges being imposed. The board’s statement of charges doesn’t specify the nature of Gordon’s profession, but board records show his controlled substance license is tied to his veterinary practice.
A hearing on the matter is scheduled for June 25, 2025.
State records indicate Gordon has faced licensing sanctions on several occasions:
May 2003: The Board of Veterinary Medicine sent Gordon a letter concerning an alleged failure to adequately document and maintain medical records.
July 2007: The Board of Veterinary Medicine sent Gordon a letter concerning an alleged failure to provide clients with medical records upon their request.
May 2017: The Board of Veterinary Medicine entered into a settlement agreement with Gordon related to allegations involving a surgery that failed to meet state standards. That case resulted in his license being placed on probation for one year and the imposition of a $1,000 fine.
2022: Gordon was suspended by the Prairie Meadows Racetrack and Casino’s board of stewards for allegedly violating regulations of both the state and the Horseracing Integrity and Safety Authority.
The board of stewards subsequently concluded Gordon possessed chemical or biological substances that were not FDA approved; that he had administered thyroxine or thyroid hormones in horses; and that he had failed to maintain adequate records, had possessed expired drugs and had improperly stored controlled substances.
The board of stewards fined Gordon $1,000 and suspended for two years his license to operate at the racetrack. Gordon appealed that decision and the board later agreed to reduce the suspension by nine months.
2023: The Board of Veterinary Medicine alleged it had received a complaint concerning Gordon’s treatment of racehorses at Iowa’s racetracks and that his actions may have violated state regulations.
The board subsequently concluded Gordon possessed expired drugs and medications, failed to properly store and label controlled substances, failed to maintain the required log of controlled substances, and failed to complete accurate and legible medical records as required. According to the Board of Veterinary Medicine, Gordon admitted to each of the allegations.
As a result, his veterinary license was placed on probation for one year beginning in March 2024, he was fined $1,000, and he was ordered to take online courses veterinary law and ethics, medical recordkeeping, and the legal requirements associated with medical records.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)The state’s universities will reevaluate door locks and lockdown protocol as a result of a statewide safety reevaluation prompted by the April 17 shootings at Florida State University that killed two people. 
State University System Chancellor Ray Rodrigues told the Florida Board of Governors Thursday that he has instructed each institution to, over the summer, “assess the security of their buildings and the ability to execute a lockdown drill.”
“Specifically, we want to know if the doors can be locked from the inside and, if there are windows in the doors, can those be covered or protected?” Rodrigues said during the virtual meeting. 
FSU students come to Capitol with asks following campus shooting

The idea, Rodrigues said, is to understand the needs of each university in time to make budget requests to the Legislature for the 2026 session.
A petition on change.org has nearly 32,000 signatures advocating for locks on FSU classroom doors after some people on campus reported doors students barricaded behind while the shooter walked the campus could not lock.
System leaders are planning a “safety summit” in October to share institutions’ assessments and suggest best practices. 
The Florida Department of Education hosted Florida’s National Summit on School Safety in February, focusing on policies implemented since the 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland that killed 17 people. 
“This is an active criminal case. We know what’s in the arrest report. We know what the media has reported. When the trial is completed, everything will be out,” Rodrigues said. 
“I feel confident in saying the response of the FSU campus police in this situation was nothing short of amazing, and this could have been a much, much worse tragedy than it was — obviously tragic to have students shot and to have any loss of life. But the quick response of the FSU campus police prevented this from being much, much, much worse than it could have been.”
Phoenix Ikner, a 20-year-old FSU student, was indicted by a grand jury Wednesday on two counts of first-degree murder and seven counts of attempted murder after he was released from the hospital.
He had been there since the day of the shooting, recovering from a gunshot wound to his jaw. Ikner is being held in Wakulla County jail south of Tallahassee.

Senate Republicans approved their own version of the budget weeks ago, sending it to the House. But as is standard practice, the House will pass a budget of its own, requiring budget writers from both chambers to sit down and hammer out a compromise.
Rep. Donny Lambeth (R-Forsyth), a lead House budget writer, remarked that the proposal developed by him and his GOP colleagues was “better than the Senate’s.” But he said concerns about the national landscape, as well as a busy few weeks that also included the “crossover” deadline, complicated matters.
“Are there cuts in here that I don’t like?” Lambeth said. “Absolutely. But we’re up against a really challenging time economically … we’ve just had to balance out a lot of priorities.”
The rapid process Thursday drew frustration from Democrats, who did not have access to the budget’s hundreds of pages until just prior to committee hearings. And their ability to amend the budget was limited by a series of watertight legislative rules that prevented almost all substantive changes.
“With respect, we should really have more time — at least a day,” said Rep. Phil Rubin (D-Wake).
Early next week, larger committees will approve the budget before it heads to the full floor for debate.

Education: Cell phone ban, internet restrictions, UNC tuition hike. Teacher raises TBD
The House budget is widely expected to include raises to teachers, principals and school staff, much like the Senate’s. But the specifics of those raises aren’t yet known; details will come next week.
Lawmakers have debated different variations on cell phone restrictions for K-12 classrooms this session. A version is included in the House education budget that would require all districts to eliminate or severely restrict phone access.
School boards would also be required to adopt guidance for policing how students can access the internet. They would be limited to “age-appropriate subject matter,” and wouldn’t be able to access social media through school-provided internet.
And $10 million would be earmarked yearly to train teachers on the “science of reading,” a method for teaching literacy in schools championed by the last two state Republican superintendents.
The UNC System would be hit with funding reductions — $61 million in the first year of the budget, and $69 million in the second. The Board of Governors would be asked to prioritize cuts to the system office and systemwide initiatives before making cuts to individual campuses.
Tuition rates would also likely go up. Lawmakers are asking the system to generate at least $30 million from tuition in new revenue in fiscal year 2026-27. The system has not raised tuition in nine years.
Health care: Cutting equity office, Medicaid work requirements and removing weight loss drugs
On the chopping block under the House’s budget for the Department of Health and Human Services is the Office of Health Equity.
The office, which describes itself as working to “eliminate health disparities,” is eliminated under the plan. Legislative staff said the cut would mean the removal of three full-time positions, and save around $3.2 million.
Lawmakers are also aiming to cut long-empty positions, tasking HHS with cutting $10 million worth of vacant roles. That would roughly equate to 200 cut positions.
The state’s expanded Medicaid program would also see major changes under the budget.
Like the Senate version, House lawmakers are moving to attach work requirements to Medicaid coverage. House Republicans in Washington are working to include similar requirements in the federal budget.
The budget would also end coverage of weight management drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy for Medicaid enrollees.
And the House plan takes a slightly different tack than the Senate on child care, but still aims to increase the subsidy reimbursement rate.
Justice and courts: Keeping innocence commission, carving out SBI
The House declined to follow the Senate’s lead in eliminating the Innocence Inquiry Commission, which investigates post-trial claims of actual innocence. Instead, it proposes to rename the program to the “Postconviction Review Commission.”
Budget writers in the House are also proposing to make the State Bureau of Investigation an independent agency, removing it from the purview of the Department of Public Safety. Lawmakers made a similar move with the highway patrol last year — a measure currently being challenged in court.
Republicans are also making a number of changes to judgeships — removing them from some counties and adding them to others. Those changes drew Democratic opposition, with Rep. Marcia Morey (D-Durham) filing an unsuccessful amendment to reverse the removal of a judge from her district.
The House budget also amps up funding for the Center for Safer Schools, providing $50 million in school safety grants. The Senate plan allotted $35 million.

General government: Election board changes, state agency insurance and lieutenant governor cuts
Like teacher pay, details on raises for state workers — which are expected to be higher than in the Senate’s budget — were not included in the draft budget Thursday.
North Carolina’s State Board of Elections would see major changes under the House plan. It creates seven new “exempt” (politically protected) staff positions for the board, a $1.5 million litigation fund for the hiring of private attorneys and $2 million to move the board into the same building that houses the state auditor’s office.
The board recently came under new, Republican-appointed leadership after the legislature passed a law shifting governance of the board to Dave Boliek, the Republican state auditor. Amendments offered by Rubin, a Democrat, to remove or delay the provisions were shot down by Republicans.
The House is also proposing a new self-insurance system for state agencies, designed to replace a current system to protect state property. It would cost $200 million.
House budget writers also included a laundry list of bills introduced this session to adopt new state symbols, including a state star, cookie and television show. And they set aside money to keep the legislative building’s snack bar open later than usual when lawmakers remain in session.
Committee on Agricultural and Natural and Economic Resources: More cuts to DEQ, small boosts to cultural resources
As has been the pattern for several years under Republican legislative leadership, the House proposal targets the Department of Environmental Quality for cuts to funding and programming
Among other things, the proposal would eliminate the Office of Environmental Education, three positions assigned to the Environmental Justice initiative, and four positions in the Facilities and Health Services and Public Information Office sections. The proposal also axes funding used to support a pathologist position at North Carolina State University’s Center for Marine Sciences and Technology.
In contrast, the Department of Natural and Cultural Resources would realize some modest funding increases. This includes exhibit updates at state historic sites, as well as positions and operating costs for the expanded visitor center and grounds at Fort Fisher State Historic Site and North Carolina Transportation Museum.
The budget allows funding to add a conservator, a museum park director, and a curator of Judaic art at the North Carolina Museum of Art, as well as additional funds for the North Carolina Symphony.
The proposal also proposes more funding for costs associated with renovating and expanding the Fort Fisher Aquarium, and the new Asia complex at the North Carolina Zoo.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_1706-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-15 15:07:42.122671

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)Attorney General Dana Nessel on Thursday announced more details about the charges her office filed against a former aide to ex-House Speaker Jason Wentworth (R-Farwell).
David Coker Jr, 51, of Clare, was arraigned on seven charges Wednesday, including embezzlement and conducting a criminal enterprise.
The charges revolve around the use of a $25 million state appropriation that was given in 2022 to a non-profit Coker founded just one month before the budget was passed. The appropriation was earmarked by Wentworth, his former boss.

Nessel said it’s an example of an outdated appropriations system in Lansing that is “more about who you know than what your expertise is, or your experience, or your ability to carry out that project.”
Complete Health Park later entered into a contract with IW Consulting, another entity owned and operated by Coker, to oversee development of the health and recreation complex the grant was for.
In December 2022, Coker asked the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services to disburse $9.9 million in grant funds, including $820,000 categorized as “other expenses.”
The same day the state released the funds, Coker allegedly transferred the full $820,000 “other expenses” amount to his consulting firm, fulfilling two invoices he allegedly both authored and approved.
Investigators with Nessel’s office alleged that the funds overstated the value of services rendered, arguing it would be impossible to provide more than $800,000 worth of consulting in about two weeks.
Once the funds were transferred to his IW Consulting account, Nessel’s office said Coker then quickly began emptying the business account into his own personal accounts and using the funds to pay off personal debts and make large purchases, including four vehicles, more than 70 silver, gold and platinum bars, at least 50 rare coins “and a few literal silver bullets.”
“It is our allegation that Coker constructed this arrangement from the very onset to be financial agent of both entities and the representative of the grant recipient to the state agency grant administrator in order to acquire for himself what we allege to be significant stolen fund sums,” Nessel said.

About $3.5 million of the funds that the state paid out were used to purchase land owned by state Rep. Tom Kunse (R-Clare), which Nessel said may have exceeded the value of the property as no appraisal was completed before the purchase.
While Nessel said her office’s investigation did not establish criminal wrongdoing by either Wentworth or Kunse, she added that “none of it looks very good.”
Nessel said it’s very unlikely the project could have been completed with the initial $25 million.
“What would that mean to me? Likely that Mr. Coker would be going back to the state Legislature to request more earmarks, to request more money to complete this project,” Nessel said. “And who might have been one of those people that he would have asked to sponsor such an earmark? Possibly Rep. Kunse, who had just gotten paid $3.5 million for his property.”
“Now, is that illegal? No, it is not,” Nessel added. “Does it raise red flags? Is it ethically concerning? I would suggest yes.”
She said it’s an example of an outdated appropriations system in Lansing that is “more about who you know than what your expertise is, or your experience, or your ability to carry out that project.”
But she expressed optimism that recent changes will make the process more transparent, including a requirement that every legislative grant request include a named sponsor and that grant recipients are limited to public entities and nonprofits that have been properly registered for at least a year.
“It’s inexplicable to me that you would have some of these LLCs that seemingly just come into being days, weeks or a month prior to the appropriation being signed into law,” Nessel said. “To me, that’s pretty obvious in terms of, you know, you are putting together this company, this nonprofit, purely for the reason that you’re going to be receiving an earmark, as opposed to a long standing organization who’s done good work for many, many years.”
Nessel said the matter was referred to her office in August 2023 after Sen. Roger Hauck (R-Mt. Pleasant) expressed concerns to MDHHS about the way the project was being handled.
She said her office is “still actively investigating two other high-profile cases stemming from the old process,” a $20 million grant to Fay Beydoun for Global Link International, a nonprofit incorporated 10 days after the appropriation was passed, and a $2 million grant to Michigan Aerospace Manufacturers Association Executive Director Gavin Brown meant to study bringing commercial rocket launches to Michigan.

Photo by Getty Images.Minnesota’s suicide rate held steady between 2023 and 2024, according to preliminary data from the state Department of Health. 
The 813 estimated suicides in the state last year work out to an age-adjusted rate of 13.9 per 100,000. Death statistics are typically reported in age-adjusted terms to account for how the age composition of a population changes over time.
The long-term trend is one of steady increase. Since 2000, Minnesota’s suicide rate has increased by roughly 50%.

The pattern is similar nationally. Suicide is closely linked to some mental health conditions, as well as substance use and gambling disorders, both of which have been increasing. Economic uncertainty, chronic illness, easy access to guns, fraying social ties and other factors also play a role.
“The overall increase in deaths by suicide over the last couple of decades continues to be concerning,” said Minnesota Health Commissioner Brooke Cunningham. “Every death by suicide is a tragedy and can have an ongoing impact on families and communities.”
The demographic picture is similar to prior years: Men are three times more likely to commit suicide than women. People in their 50s and in their 80s are more likely to die of suicide than those in other age groups. Indigenous Minnesotans have the highest suicide rates, followed by white, Black, Hispanic and Asian Minnesotans. 
The suicide rate in the state’s rural areas is about twice as high as in the Twin Cities, and previous research has found that the increase is happening faster in rural areas than in other places. Lack of access to mental health services is one major contributor.
Easy access to guns also plays a role in the elevated rural suicide numbers, and deaths involving those guns are increasing: Firearms were the mechanism in 43% of Minnesota suicide deaths in 2019, and in 51% of those deaths in 2024. 
MDH officials are also keeping an eye on how draconian cuts to federal spending could impact the suicide rate and efforts to reduce it. President Trump’s proposed federal budget would eliminate the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the White House has cut funding for the substance abuse and mental health services as well.
The administration has also proposed cuts to the funding for some 988 suicide prevention hotline services.
Preliminary data shows that the state’s 988 responders answered more than 90,000 contacts in 2024, a significant increase from the previous year, according to MDH.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1365261855-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-05-15 15:07:42.122671

“We will provide another update by the middle of next week as things continue to develop,” Speaker Daniel Perez wrote to representatives Thursday afternoon.
The Legislature initially gave itself until at least June 6 to solidify a budget and tax plan. The House voted this week to extend that until June 30. The Senate would have to agree to that extension.
“Over the past week, Chair [Ed] Hooper and I have continued to have productive discussions with our partners in the House on joint budget allocations,” Senate President Ben Albritton wrote to senators Thursday afternoon. “I believe we are making progress; however, we are not in a position to begin budget conference next week.”
The two leaders announced on May 2, the original scheduled last day of session, that they had reached an agreement on a budget framework. That agreement went to the wayside after Gov. Ron DeSantis said he would veto a cut to sales taxes, a provision included in the legislative branch’s agreement.
“I understand the week-to-week updates are challenging for long-term planning,” Albritton wrote. “Our goal is to bring the allocations discussion to a conclusion and announce a schedule for the budget conference as quickly and responsibly as possible, keeping in mind the priorities you are expecting Chair Hooper and I to advocate for in our budget.”
Tuesday, Perez made clear he was frustrated with DeSantis, saying the governor was unwilling to have conversations about the budget. Perez was unhappy with Albritton, too, for going back to the budget drawing board after DeSantis’ veto threat.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Republicans’ supermajorities in both chambers of the Iowa Legislature allowed them to push several high-profile bills to the governor throughout the legislative session – but many of the thousands of bills discussed this session failed to advance.
Lawmakers adjourned for the 2025 legislative session early Thursday after a night of debate and closed-door caucus meetings and nearly two weeks after the session was scheduled to end. Republicans were able to reach agreements Wednesday to pass several of the policy bills that had failed to advance earlier in the session, including Gov. Kim Reynolds’ bills providing paid parental leave for state employees and reducing the state’s unemployment insurance taxes on employers.
Earlier in the year, the Republican-controlled chambers moved quickly to pass measures like the bill removing gender identity from the Iowa Civil Rights Act. Other measures passed through with less coordination – legislation on eminent domain use in carbon sequestration pipelines only made it to a vote following a concerted effort by a group of 12 GOP senators who said they would not support any budget bills until the bill was brought to the floor.

However, many of the bills discussed throughout the session failed to make it to the governor’s desk. Among the legislation that failed are several of the priorities put forward by Reynolds in January, as well as legislation on a top issue highlighted by Republican legislative leaders: property taxes.
Though many measures failed this session, they can be revived in the 2026 legislative session, the second part of the 91st General Assembly. Additionally, not all of the bills passed are guaranteed to become law – they’re contingent on Reynolds’ signature.
The governor has 30 days from the end of session, June 14, to sign bills passed from the 2025 session into law.
Here’s a breakdown on high-profile bills passed and signed into law from this session – and the legislation that did not move forward:
 Signed into law

Gender identity protections: Reynolds signed Senate File 418 into law in February, removing gender identity as a protected class under the Iowa Civil Rights Act. The bill, the first measure signed from this session, removes protections against discrimination in employment, housing, public accommodations and education for transgender individuals on the basis of their gender identity. It also removes Iowans’ ability to change their sex as designated on their birth certificate after receiving gender-affirming medical treatment, and modifies definitions of “sex” and “gender” in Iowa law, and changes language in the law banning material related to gender identity for K-6 students to refer to “gender theory.”
Hands-free cellphones: Senate File 22, signed into law in April, bans the handheld use of cellphones and other electronic devices while driving when not in voice-activated or handsfree modes. The measure has been supported by law enforcement officials and families of people involved in car accidents that said the state’s current distracted driving laws do not allow for effective enforcement. Warnings will begin for violations of the law July 1, with penalties beginning Jan. 1, 2026.
Nursing home oversight: House File 309 changed a 2024 law that allows nursing homes to provide additional context and evidence before the Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing makes a decision to issue a citation when reviewing claims of substandard care and placing residents in immediate jeopardy of serious injury or death. Democrats brought forward multiple amendments to add other proposals they said would improve nursing home oversight in the state that were not granted subcommittee hearings that were not added to the bill.
Open beverage containers: House File 181, signed into law in March, extends Iowa’s ban on open containers of alcoholic beverages in the passenger compartments of vehicles to drinks containing tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC. 
Workforce training contract requirements: Senate File 603 makes changes to the state Registered Apprenticeship Act, barring state agencies and local governments from mandating requirements related to apprenticeship training for contractors outside of legal requirements. Local entities would also not be allowed implement other “restrictions, qualifications, or requirements” on contractors, subcontractors, developers and apprentices.
 Education

Accreditation retaliation: House File 295 would bar national accrediting agencies from taking negative actions against state universities for complying with, or refusing to disobey, state law. If authorized by the attorney general, universities with cause would have the option to file a civil suit against the accreditor. It was signed by Reynolds May 6.
Cellphones in school: Reynolds signed House File 782 into law in April, a bill requiring public K-12 school districts set a policy on cell phones that, at minimum, bans their use during instructional periods beginning in the 2025-2026 school year. The measure contains exemptions, including for students who have an Individualized Education Program (IEP) or 504 plan that involves accommodations using a cellphone or other device. Parents can also ask school districts to allow their child keep access to their phone during class periods if they establish a “legitimate” reason related to the student’s mental or physical health.
Career education: Career planning is required for fifth- and sixth-grade curriculum alongside expanded career education in seventh and eighth grades under House File 316. The Iowa Department of Education is also required to develop a list of industry recognized credentials and create a seal for schools to put on student transcripts and other documents if they have earned a professional credential while in the K-12 school system.
Charter school boards: House File 785 would require all members of a charter school board to be U.S. residents, and that only one member of the board can live outside Iowa.
Concussion diagnoses: House File 471 would expand the definition of “licensed health care provider” who can direct a student to be removed from extracurriculars because they show signs of brain damage or concussions. The definition is expanded to include people with a doctorate in psychology who have specialty training in neuropsychology or concussion management.
Court-ordered college payments: Senate File 513 will bar courts from ordering parties involved in the dissolution of a marriage to pay a postsecondary education subsidy for dependents. Reynolds signed the legislation May 6.
National Guard financial aid: House Files 117 and 118, both signed by the governor in early May, expand National Guard scholarship programs, with HF 117 establishing a new program for non-traditional degree seekers and HF 118 making changes to the National Guard Service Scholarship program. 
Threat assessment teams: Senate File 583 authorizes K-12 school districts, private schools and charter schools to create threat assessment teams consisting of school officials, law enforcement, mental health and social services workers. These teams, tasked with preventing school shootings and other violence, are allowed to share “reasonably necessary” information about students when their behavior could pose a safety risk to other students or school staff.
Tuition freeze: House File 440 would require state universities to study impacts of keeping tuition for students at what they paid their first undergraduate year. Universities would also need to establish at least one three-year degree program and institute work plus programs, where students can work part time and have their tuition paid for by a qualified employer. Reynolds signed the legislation May 6. 
Year-round academic calendar: House File 392 would allows school districts to apply to implement year-round school calendars for ninth through 12th grade. 
[subject]Justice[/subhed]
Firearm age limits: House File 924 lowers the age limit for carrying a firearm from age 21 to 18, a measure lawmakers said was needed in response to court rulings that found state age limits for people over 18 were unconstitutional.
[subject]Natural resources[/subhed]
Drones: Senate File 491 further restricts remote-piloted aircrafts from flying over farmsteads in Iowa. The bill would prohibit drones, without landowner permission, to fly within 400 feet of farm animals, farm equipment or structures. Reynolds approved the bill May 6.
Natural disaster assistance: Senate File 619 retroactively appropriates $13.6 million from the Iowa Economic Emergency Fund for fiscal year 2025, backfilling the response efforts following severe flooding and tornados in the summer of 2024. A majority of the funding, $11.6 million, goes to the Disaster Recovery Housing Assistance Program and $2 million to the Nuisance Property and Abandoned Building Fund, in addition to extending tax exclusions for developers building new houses in disaster-impacted areas. 
Other components of the bill include allowing the Iowa Department of Management access to 10% of the state’s Economic Emergency Fund when the governor issues a disaster proclamation and the creation of a new loan program for “ongoing risk mitigation” projects.
Roofs on docks: House File 710, signed into law May 6, allows hard dock roofs over boat slips and hoists on Iowa lakes. The law fixes an issue impacting dock owners in Carter Lake which has shores in both Iowa and Nebraska. 
 Sent to governor

	 
 Agriculture

Grain indemnity: Senate File 608 was approved by the Legislature, as a compromise between the bills proposed in each chamber. The final version of the bill, which was sent to the governor, will increase the grain indemnity fund maximum to $16 million, and minimum to $8 million,  to cover farmers’ losses when their buyers go broke. It would also allow farmers with deferred-pricing contracts to partake in the fund’s protections.
 Education

Absence exception for religious instruction: House File 870 allows students who are absent from school while attending religious instruction to be exempt from some state attendance laws.
Bullying definition: House File 865 would change the definition of bullying and harassment in Iowa Code to “repeated and targeted” acts and conduct that create a hostile school environment for a student. This is a shift from current language that defines bullying as acts and conduct based on “any actual or perceived trait or characteristic,” with 17 characteristics, including age, race, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity and disability listed as potential traits a student could face bullying over. While Republicans said schools were not enforcing anti-bullying laws if the student was not facing harassment because of one of the listed categories, Democrats said the change could mean some instances of bullying go unaddressed because they are not “repeated and targeted” acts.
Child abuse investigations: Though House File 389 – a bill that proposed giving the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services the authority to investigate alleged child abuse cases at schools – did not pass as a standalone measure, the language from this proposal made it to the governor through the standings appropriations bill. The language also allows Iowa HHS to work with the state Board of Educational Examiners when school employees were involved in these cases.
Fetal development instruction: Senate File 175 is a measure requiring human growth and development classes for Iowa students in grades 5-12 include fetal development videos and graphics depicting “the humanity of the unborn child by showing prenatal human development, starting at fertilization.” It is similar to bills discussed in previous sessions that directly reference the “Meet Baby Olivia” video produced by an anti-abortion organization, though this year’s bill does not include a specific reference to it. But this year’s measure does include one new provision – the House added a ban on materials to meet this requirement coming from entities that perform or “promote” abortions, or that contract, affiliate, or make referrals to organizations that perform or promote abortions.
Math education: House File 784 is Reynolds’ proposal to improve math education following recent scoring that the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) results that found mathematics scores decreased for Iowa fourth and eighth graders. The measure creates personalized mathematics plans and other intervention strategies to assist K-6 students deemed “persistently at risk” for mathematics proficiency, as determined through a mathematics screener from the Iowa Department of Education.
Nonpublic school athletics: School districts would be directed to allow students living in the district but attending a nonpublic school to participate in athletics offered by the public school district that were not offered by the private school for the past two years under House File 189.
School performance profiles: House File 393 would change how school performance grades are calculated for school districts, by stating the schools will not have their grade impacted by students who  of school multiple times past the first instance.
U.S. citizenship test: Iowa high schoolers would be required to pass the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services naturalization civics test to graduate beginning in the 2026-2027 school year under Senate File 369. The measure requires students earn at least 60% to pass, with those who fail allowed to retake the test as many times as necessary to earn a passing grade.
Vaccine exemptions: House File 299 would require all K-12 schools, child care centers, community colleges, public universities and private universities using the tuition grant program to include information on vaccine requirement exemptions in communications with students and families about vaccines. Child care providers and K-12 schools are also required to publish information about exemptions on their website and in student registration documents under the bill.
 Higher education

College reporting requirements: House File 890 would change where community colleges provide program-level data to from the state community colleges bureau to the Iowa Department of Education through its annual report. The Iowa Department of Administrative Services and Department of Education would also be required to develop an annual compensation schedule and determine benefits for all employees of the Iowa Educational Services for the Blind and Visually Impaired and Iowa School for the Deaf. 
DEI in state entities: House File 856 would bar state entities, including community colleges, from spending any funds on opening or keeping diversity, equity and inclusion offices or officials. The Iowa Senate voted to remove private universities from the bill through amendment May 9, to which the House concurred and sent the bill to the governor’s desk May 13. 
Medical residency requirements: House File 516 would require the University of Iowa doctor of medicine and dental programs to enroll classes made up of at least 80% resident students, or those who meet other qualifications. 
Pregnant student accommodations: Senate File 288, passed unanimously out of both chambers, would require public universities to provide reasonable accommodations for pregnant students and new mothers. These accommodations include allowing leaves of absence and providing more time to make up assignments and tests. 
School of intellectual freedom: House File 437 would have the University of Iowa establish a center for intellectual freedom, which would focus on “the historical ideas, traditions and texts that have shaped the American constitutional order and society,” according to bill language, and promote free speech, civil discourse, civic education and intellectual diversity.
 Health care

Cancer coverage for firefighters, EMS: House File 969 expands disability and death benefits for firefighters, emergency medical services responders and law enforcement officers to cover all types of cancer. It also changes contribution rates for several of the retirement and disability systems for public safety and government employees in order to finance this change.
Health care training, access: Another proposal from the governor, House File 972, proposes changes to Iowa’s health care system and training options. The proposal directed Iowa HHS to draw down more than $150 million in federal funds to create 115 new medical residency slots at state teaching hospitals, as well as consolidating and providing $10 million more in funding to the state’s student loan repayment programs. It also proposed creating a “hub-and-spoke” funding model for rural health care systems based on the state’s Centers of Excellence Program and would have increased Medicaid rates for health care providers serving mothers and infants.
Medicaid work requirements: Senate File 615, setting work requirements for Iowa’s expanded Medicaid program, passed both chambers. The measure requires people receiving health coverage through the Iowa Health and Wellness Plan, or IHAWP, to work at least 80 hours each month to retain health care coverage. The provision was for IHAWP recipients between ages 19 to 64 with some exceptions, like for people with serious illnesses or injuries and those with children under age 6. It also includes language that would end IHAWP in the future, contingent on federal approval, if the federal government allows Iowa to implement work requirements and then later revokes approval.
Outside of the legislative directive, the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services has moved to set work requirements for IHAWP through a federal waiver. The HHS proposal would set higher requirements, at 100 hours of work per month, to stay eligible with similar exemptions.
Personal needs allowance: Language in the Health and Human Services budget raises Medicaid beneficiaries’ monthly personal needs allowance – money that can be used by residents at care facilities for items like cell phone service, clothing, snacks or cable TV – from $50 to $65 each month. The policy measure was added to House File 1049 after a separate bill, Senate File 476, failed to advance, but at a lower increase to $55 per month.
Pharmacy benefit managers: Senate File 383 sets regulations on pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), the businesses negotiating prescription drug prices between drug manufacturers, health insurance companies and pharmacies in an effort to provide help to rural and independent pharmacies. The bill limits PBMs’ ability to engage in certain business practices that restrict people’s ability to fill drugs at the pharmacy of their choosing, or that provide financial incentives or penalties to encourage the use of mail-order or specific pharmacies. It also requires PBMs reimburse pharmacies for drug costs at the national or Iowa average acquisition cost, and sets a dispensing fee of $10.68 from PBMs to pharmacists for each prescription filled at rural and small pharmacies. Pharmacists and supporters said the measure will stop the trend of closures of pharmacies in rural Iowa communities, but opponents and some business group advocates said the bill will lead to higher drug and health insurance costs for Iowans.
 Labor and the workforce

Unemployment insurance taxes: Senate File 607 lowers the taxable wage base used in calculating unemployment insurance taxes from 66.7% to 33.4%, money collected from businesses and employers put toward the state’s Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund. The bill, a priority of Reynolds, also makes changes to the state’s unemployment tax tables.
 State government[subhed]
Citizenship verification for voting: House File 954 is the bill proposed by Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate after his guidance to county auditors ahead of the 2024 election to challenge the ballots of 2,176 registered voters as “potential noncitizens,” 277 of whom the Secretary of State’s office said were confirmed to not be U.S. citizens. The measure allows the Secretary of State’s office to contract with state and federal agencies, as well as private entities, to verify the citizenship status of registered voters. This provision would prevent the need to challenge ballots like in 2024, Pate said. However, the bill also allows registered voters to be challenged at the polls over their citizenship status, a provision Democrats argued could lead to discrimination.
The bill also includes a ban on ranked choice voting and an increase for the eligibility requirement to gain “political party” status on Iowa ballots.
Election recounts: House File 928 makes multiple changes to Iowa’s election recount system, including a requirement for results to be within a threshold of 1% or 50 votes, whichever is less, in order for a candidate to request a recount, with a 0.15% difference for recounts in statewide and federal races. The legislation also changes the composition of election recount boards, having county auditors leading the board with their staff and hired election workers with an equal number of workers from each political party.
Paid parental leave: A proposal the governor has proposed in several recent legislative sessions, House File 889, providing four weeks of paid parental leave for parents for state employees within 12 months of birth or adoption, made it to the finish line in 2025. The bill also adds a new policy allowing state employees to convert unused sick days to vacation time with some stipulations.
[subhed]Justice and public safety

Anti-SLAPP lawsuits: After several years of attempting to pass a bill providing protections against “strategic lawsuits against public participation,” or SLAPP lawsuits, the Legislature sent Reynolds House File 472. The measure allows expedited relief in court for actions related to First Amendment rights, like the freedom of speech and press, in SLAPP cases that are filed against news organizations and activists in an attempt to stop these entities from speaking publicly about certain issues by engaging them in long, expensive lawsuits. The bill was amended by the Senate to state anti-SLAPP protections could not be applied retroactively
Exposing minors to obscene materials: House File 306 would raise criminal penalties for the knowing dissemination or exhibition of obscene materials to a minor, with harsher penalties in place for repeat offenses. The first offense of the crime would be charged as a misdemeanor, the second offense as an aggravated misdemeanor and third or subsequent offenses would be changed as a Class D felony with mandatory minimum jail time. Minors who are charged with this crime for disseminating or showing obscene material to another minor would face a serious misdemeanor charge, but would not be subject to the heightened charges for additional offenses.
Minors testifying in court: Both chambers have approved Senate Joint Resolution 9, Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird’s proposed constitutional amendment to allow minors and some adults with disabilities to testify remotely against their alleged abusers using a closed-circuit television system. The constitutional amendment was brought forward to address an Iowa Supreme Court ruling that found this practice was unconstitutional. This is not a measure that needs the governor’s approval – it must pass in a second General Assembly, then go before voters on a general election ballot before it can be added to the state constitution.
Open records, meetings: House File 706 proposes raising penalties for violations of Iowa’s open meeting laws and would require newly elected and appointed public officials to receive training on open meetings and records laws. The measure was amended by the Senate to block two types of records – security camera footage at the Iowa Capitol and information from state employee identification card access systems – from public access, listing them as confidential records.
Police review boards: Cities that have a civil service commission could not adopt or establish a citizens’ boards that review the conduct of law enforcement officers under Senate File 311. The measure also makes changes to the makeup of city civil service commissions, as well as how legal disputes proceed when employees dispute a commission’s decisions or actions.
Service animals: House File 615 would remove current requirements in state law that law enforcement officials say make it more difficult to charge people for misrepresenting an animal as a service animal. It would remove current provisions stating a person must be first given a warning and can only be charged for misrepresentation of an animal as a service animal or service animal in training if they knowingly falsify the animal’s status.
 Pipelines

Eminent domain: Following a dramatic debate around eminent domain, carbon sequestration pipelines and the potential holes in the bill, House File 639 advanced from the Senate Monday. Despite numerous attempted amendments, including one that would have replaced the bill with language from House File 943, to outlaw eminent domain on CO2 pipelines, none of the amendments were adopted. 
HF 639 would adjust the definition of a common carrier, expand who is able to intervene in Iowa Utilities Commission proceedings, restrict the IUC’s ability to sanction intervenors, require IUC presence at all hearings, limit the permits for CO2 pipelines to one 25-year term and hold the pipeline operators responsible for insurance increases landowners face. 
 Failed to advance

 Agriculture

Anaerobic digesters: House File 989, which would task DNR with creating regulations for anaerobic digestors, or oxygen deprived systems to break down waste and convert it into biogas. The bill separates permits for anaerobic digestion systems from animal feeding operations. It did not advance in the Senate. 
Bee tax exemption: House File 1001 would remove the sales tax on honey bees, to bring the insects in line with other livestock tax structures. The bill advanced with unanimous approval from committee, but did not see floor debate. 
Reducing nitrogen fertilizer: House File 942 would have created a pilot program to reduce the statewide average use of commercial nitrogen fertilizers by 15% with the creation of a pilot program in the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship. The bill did not advance from a House Appropriations committee. 
 Education

Baseball: House File 153 would have directed Iowa State University and the University of Northern Iowa to reinstate men’s baseball teams. The bill did not survive the first funnel.
Bible studies in public schools: House File 845 and Senate File 510 were proposals directing the state Board of Education to establish course standards for elective social studies classes on “Hebrew Scriptures or the Old or New Testament of the Bible.” School districts that chose to offer these elective courses for 9th through 12th grade students would still have been required to comply with state and federal religious neutrality requirements under the bill.
Civil government course: House File 402, which failed to make it through the second funnel, would have required college students to take a course on American history and civil government in order to earn their baccalaureate degree. 
DEI courses in public universities: House File 269 would have barred state universities from requiring students to take a course related to diversity, equity and inclusion or critical race theory to satisfy general education requirements or earn any level of certification or degree, with certain exceptions. Employees of the institutions would have also been prohibited from requiring or incentivizing faculty to participate in DEI or critical race theory-related practices or having those topics in content. The bill died after Senate subcommittee passage. 
DEI in community colleges: House File 855 would have added community colleges to legislation passed last year prohibiting state universities from funding or maintaining DEI offices. While this legislation did not make it through the second funnel, community colleges are included in a bill that would bar state entities from funding DEI offices or officers. 
DEI in private universities: House File 854 would have prohibited private universities from opening, funding or otherwise maintaining offices of diversity, equity and inclusion as a prerequisite for participation in the Iowa Tuition Grant program. 
Dropout prevention funding: House File 579 would have increased the limit for a funding source – the modified supplemental amount ratio – that school districts can levy to fund dropout prevention programs to 5% if approved in an election, with the amount not allowed to increase more than 0.5% each fiscal year.
Financial information: House File 296 would have required universities to report and post online budget lines, expenditures and goods and services totaling $50,000, as well as written contracts, salary reports and any expenditures made related to diversity, equity and inclusion. The bill, as well as others, were referred back to the Iowa House Higher Education Committee after dying in the second funnel. 
Food dyes and margarine: The use of synthetic food dyes, margarine and other artificial additives would be banned from school meals, snacks and beverages under House File 212, a measure modeled after a California law.
Foreign funding: House File 575 would have required state universities to put together an annual report on foreign funding sources, amounts and how funds were used. The legislation did not make it through the second funnel deadline. 
General education requirements: House File 401 would have codified general education requirements for public colleges and universities, including directives to have students take courses in social studies, math and statistics, natural and social sciences, the humanities, Western heritage and American heritage. According to the bill, these classes cannot “distort significant historical events or include any curriculum or other material that teaches identity politics or is based on theories that systemic racism, sexism, oppression, or privilege are inherent in the institutions of the United States of America or the state of Iowa.” It was placed under unfinished business in April.
Grooming behavior: Senate File 273 would have implemented mandatory reporting requirements of school employees licensed by the state Board of Educational Examiners if they engage in “grooming behavior” toward students, defined as actions taken to build “trust or emotional connections with a student with the intent to exploit such student.”
Gulf of America: House Study Bill 97 would have required Iowa schools replace references to the Gulf of Mexico with “Gulf of America” and “Denali” with “Mount McKinley” in instruction and classroom handouts, in accordance with an order from President Donald Trump to rename these geological features in early 2025.
Home schooling: House File 888 would have made changes to state regulations on homeschooling. It included provisions allowing more than four unrelated children to receive instruction from one person, and would have removed current requirements that parents of students in homeschool instruction provide proof of immunization and blood lead tests. The measure also would have prohibited world language courses that use grammatical gender systems, like Spanish or French, from using gender-neutral language.
Iowa Tuition Grant changes: House File 867 would have required Iowa College Aid to allocate half of Iowa Tuition Grant dollars to students enrolled in degree programs connected to high-wage, high-demand job fields. The legislation failed to make it through the second funnel.   
Library associations: House File 880 would have stripped eligibility to receive Enrich Iowa Funds provided through the State Library of Iowa for libraries that are members of nonprofit organizations like the Iowa Library Association or American Library Association that engage in advocacy or lobbying work at the state, federal or local level.
Loan programs: House File 703 would have required ISL Education Lending to report certain loan data to Iowa College Aid relating to the annual percentage rate of the Federal Direct PLUS loan compared to college family loans and partnership loans. If the loans had a lower APR than the federal loan program, Iowa College Aid would have needed to post the information online and share it with universities, which would add it to financial aid offers. The bill died in the second funnel.
Peace officer tuition waivers: House Study Bill 329 would have required state universities and community colleges to waive tuition and fees for eligible members of law enforcement and other peace officers in Iowa and created a fund to reimburse institutions for waivers. The bill passed out of subcommittee in April, but did not move forward. 
Penalties for pro-terrorism language on campus: House File 576 would have allowed public and private colleges to penalize certain nonimmigrant visa-holders for voicing support for, or encouraging others to support, terrorist organizations or actions. 
Schools and natural disasters: House File 315 would have granted school districts impacted by natural disasters to have an additional year of budget adjustments.
School chaplains: The House passed House File 884, legislation allowing public school districts, charter schools and school innovation votes allow religious chaplains to provide “services” to students, through employment or volunteering. The measure did not receive a hearing on the Senate floor.
Sexual abuse education: Senate File 172, also called “Erin’s Law,” would have directed the state Department of Education to create guidelines for schools to teach K-6 students about child sex abuse.
Syllabus reports: House File 270 would have required state university instructors post syllabi information online in a way the public can access, including the instructor’s name, planned lessons, course requirements and materials that will be used in class. While the legislation died, the Iowa Board of Regents has directed state universities to post syllabus information online. 
Tampons, pads in school bathrooms: House File 883 proposed putting free feminine hygiene products in women’s restrooms at Iowa schools for 6th through 12th grade students. The initiative would have been funded by the state from the summer of 2025 through June 2028. Though a House subcommittee was held on the bill during the last week of session, it did not advance.
Tuition waivers: House File 577 would have required state universities to waive tuition and fees and provide a $5,000-a-semester stipend for undergraduate students who earn the highest-possible scores on the ACT or SAT, but failed pass through the second funnel. 
Use of names, pronouns: Senate File 8 proposed banning schools from disciplining a teacher or student for not using a transgender student’s preferred name or pronouns if these differ from their legal name or pronouns corresponding with the legally designated sex, regardless of if a parent had directed a school to use a different name or pronouns for their child.
 Health care

Abortion protection: Senate Joint Resolution 1 was a proposed constitutional amendment from Senate Democrats enshrining the right to access reproductive care. It did not receive any subcommittee or committee hearings.
Child care access: One of Reynolds’ priority bills for the 2025 session on child care passed the Senate with an amendment, but was not taken up in the House. Senate File 445 proposed shifting $16 million in funding from Early Childhood Iowa (ECI) and federal Child Care and Development Fund Wrap Around Child Care funds to create a new competitive grant pilot program, providing three-year grants of up to $100,000 for preschool and child care centers to provide full-day care, in addition to consolidating 34 ECI boards into seven regional boards. The measure also proposed shifting roughly $3.6 million in funding from the Shared Visions program for at-risk children from birth to age 5 to go to programs for at-risk 3- and 4-year-old children.
The bill also included a provision to permanently enact an existing pilot program allowing child care workers to receive state assistance for child care of their own children.
Child care workers: House File 382 would have allowed minors as young as age 16 to provide “flex care” for children from infancy to age 2 without direct adult supervision in child care centers.
HPV vaccine for minors: Senate File 304, passed by the Senate, would have removed a provision in Iowa law that allows minors to consent to vaccinations related to the prevention, diagnosis or treatment of sexually transmitted diseases or infections – most notably, the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine – without their parents’ approval. Iowa law requires parental consent for minors to receive most other vaccines.
Medical conscience: Health care professionals, institutions and payors would not have to perform or pay for a health care service they say goes against their conscience or personal beliefs under House File 571. The measure, which passed the House but was not debated on the Senate floor, would have stated these entities could not be held  civilly, criminally or administratively liable if they do not perform health care services because of a personal belief stated in “good faith.”
Medication abortion restrictions: House File 775 would have banned abortion medication from being distributed by mail, requiring these medications be distributed in-person with patients giving written consent to receive the medication acknowledging risks and ability to potentially reverse the effects of abortion medication.
mRNA vaccines: Senate File 360 would have banned gene-based vaccines that use nucleic acids like messenger RNA (mRNA), such as the  Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. It would have penalized providers that administer mRNA vaccines with a simple misdemeanor charge and fine of $500 for each violation.
Nursing home inspectors: Senate File 532, a proposal from Democratic Sen. Claire Celsi, would have made multiple changes to nursing home oversight, including a $600,000 funding increase for 30 new care-facility inspectors, higher penalties for certain regulatory violations by health care facilities. It also proposed banning Medicaid-certified nursing homes from requiring residents or families consent to arbitration instead of legal action over negligent care claims.
Psilocybin program: House File 978 proposed legalizing the use of psilocybin, the psychoactive compound in “magic mushrooms,” for psychiatric therapy. The bill proposed creating a similar program to the Iowa medical cannabis program for psilocybin, including the creation of a Psilocybin Production Establishment Licensing Board. The measure passed the House but was not taken up in the Senate.
Vaccine manufacturer immunity: House File 712 proposed requiring vaccine manufacturers waive immunity from lawsuits over certain vaccine injuries in order to distribute vaccines in the state. Currently, many vaccine injuries are covered through a no-fault compensation program under the federal 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act.
 Labor and the workforce

Public sector union lists: Senate File 472 dealt with the recertification process for unions through the Employment Appeal Board (EAB). The bill would allow Iowans to seek court action compelling government employers to provide a list of employees within a bargaining unit to the EAB, a required step before a union recertification vote that some Republicans claimed employers were intentionally not performing as a way to preserve existing union representation in contract negotiations.
 State government

Annexing southern Minnesota: Sen. Mike Bousselot’s proposal directing the state to begin negotiations with Minnesota for the purchase of nine southern Minnesota counties, Senate File 354, did not receive a subcommittee meeting.
Artificial intelligence: Rep. Ray Sorenson, chair of the House Economic Growth and Technology Committee, said he expects conversation on the use of artificial technology in creating election materials to continue in the 2026 legislative session. This year’s proposal, House Study Bill 294, failed to advance through the first funnel.
Citizenship on IDs: House File 439 proposed requiring Iowa driver’s licenses and non-operator identification cards list a person’s citizenship status, a measure supporters said would help poll workers verify voters’ citizenship status during elections but that critics said could lead to discrimination.
County funding: House Study Bill 310 proposed putting a three-year moratorium on Iowa Economic Development Authority (IEDA) programs and funding for the four most populous counties in the state.
Homelessness: House Study Bill 286 and Senate Study Bill 1195 were companion proposals discussed earlier this session to criminalize sleeping and camping on public property. The bills, which did not advance, would have also allowed local governments to designate certain spaces for legal homeless encampments, and to create “drug-free homeless service zones” – places where the facility operators could face criminal charges if individuals receiving services are found to possess or use controlled substances while at the facility.
Property taxes: House Study Bill 313 and Senate Study Bill 1208 address rising property taxes in the state. While there are many components to the bill, one of the top changes included is a move from the state’s “rollback” to a “revenue-restricted” system for calculating local property tax costs, capping the increase of most property tax levy rates to 2% each year. The measure would also shift $426 million funding for K-12 schools from local property taxes to the state.
Republican legislative leaders said they aimed to move on property taxes this session,but also said that the legislation was being reviewed to ensure that the measure will have its intended impact of lowering property tax costs for Iowans.Senate President Amy Sinclair said she would “like to see it get done this year, but we want it done right, rather than fast.”
Religious beliefs of adoptive, foster parents: Prospective foster or adoptive parents could not be required to accept policies about gender identity and sexual orientation that conflict with their personal beliefs in order to be deemed eligible to become a child’s caretaker under Senate File 473.
 Justice and public safety

Age verification for obscene materials: House File 864 would have required pornography websites and other online distributors of obscene material implement “reasonable” age verification methods to prevent minors’ access.
Age verification for social media: Parents would need to give permission before a minor could create an account on a social media platform under House File 798. The bill also would have required social media companies provide parents the ability to access their child’s posts and messages on the platform, and to revoke access to the account at any time.
Death penalty: Senate File 320, this year’s proposal to reinstate the death penalty in Iowa, proposed capital punishment in cases where a person was convicted of first-degree murder of a law enforcement officer.
Human smuggling: House File 572 would have created the criminal offense of human smuggling, defined as acts including the transportation of an undocumented person with the intent to conceal them from law enforcement, encouraging or coercing them to stay in the country against the law by concealing or harboring them, and directing multiple people to say on agricultural lands without the landowner’s consent. The bill proposed higher penalties for cases involving monetary gain and those that risk or cause serious bodily injury or death. Religious and immigrant rights advocates argued the measure could mean people providing aid to undocumented immigrants could face criminal charges.
ICE agreements: House Study Bill 187 would have required all law enforcement agencies in Iowa to enter into written memorandums of agreement with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) by Jan. 1, 2026, for participation in immigration law enforcement efforts. Law enforcement officers and immigrant rights groups expressed concerns about the measure hurting relationships between police and Latino communities and putting new financial strains on local law enforcement.
Immigration law enforcement: House File 946 was proposed following a February social media post by Winneshiek County Sheriff Dan Marx in February stating he would not comply with immigration detainer requests from ICE or other federal agencies outside of “valid” judicial warrants and court orders – a post that also result in Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird filing a lawsuit against the county and Marx for violating state law. The bill, which passed the House but did not advance in the Senate, stated law enforcement officers who “knowingly and intentionally” fail to comply with state laws on federal immigration enforcement would be subject to investigation by the attorney general.
Obscene performances: House File 891 garnered significant attention earlier in the 2025 session, when a version of the bill proposed penalties related to minors going to drag shows that defined these shows as performances where the main aspect is “a performer who exhibits a gender identity that is different than the performer’s gender assigned at birth through the use of clothing, makeup, accessories, or other gender signifiers.” The measure was significantly changed, removing this definition and creating a new criminal charge for exposing a minor to an obscene performance or admitting a minor to premises with obscene performances, evaluated using current obscenity definitions. The bill still failed to advance.
Obscenity laws in libraries: House File 521 proposed removing current obscenity law exemptions for libraries and educational institutions. The measure could have subjected public libraries to costly litigation, opponents said, by people who want certain materials removed from shelves even if those materials do not meet the definition of “obscene” in Iowa law.
Pesticide lawsuits: Senate File 394, a proposal providing legal protections for pesticide manufacturers from certain lawsuits, including claims that pesticide products gave individuals cancer, passed the Senate but did not have enough support to pass the Iowa House. This multistate legislation spurred by the manufacturer of Roundup failed for the second year.
 Natural resources

Beneficial use water permits: House File 861 would have required the Iowa Department of Natural Resources to determine beneficial use on a case-by-case basis when considering water-use permits.
Chemtrails: House File 927 would have prohibited the release of air contaminants that intentionally affect “temperature, weather, or the intensity of sunlight.” Rep. Adam Zabner, D-Iowa City, proposed an amendment to the bill to “research the existence of Bigfoot in the state.” 
Community solar: A bill that did not see debate, House File 404, would have allowed communities to build small solar projects and connect into the electric power grid. Community members would have received waivers on their electricity bills if they purchased shares of the solar project. Utility companies opposed the bill because they would have been responsible for the connection maintenance.
Governor’s energy bill: An energy bill proposed by the governor faced significant opposition from both the U.S. Department of Justice and former Iowa Utilities Commission members. 
House File 834 and Senate File 585 would have granted existing utility companies the right of first refusal to new transmission projects, expanded advanced ratemaking principles and created regulations for anaerobic digesters. 
Land acquisition: Bills that would have prohibited DNR purchases of land from auction, Senate File 553 and House File 714, did not advance.
PFAS: A bill that required sewage sludge to be tested for perfluoroalkyl, polyfluoroalkyl or PFAS did not advance. House File 723 would have notified landowners if the sludge destined for their fields contained PFAS. 
 Pipelines

Eminent domain for CO2 pipelines: House File 943 would have stopped hazardous liquid pipelines from being granted eminent domain rights. The bill, advanced from the House, had its language added as an amendment to HF 639, but was ruled not germane during Senate debate. 
Office of the Consumer Advocate: Representatives unanimously passed House File 578 to restore the Office of the Consumer Advocate as an independent office, but the bill did not advance in the Senate. 
 Nutrition

Double Up Food Bucks: House File 970 would have allocated $1 million to the Double Up Food Bucks program which allows recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, to double their spending on produce. The bill, which advanced from the House, but was not taken up by the Senate, conditioned the allocation to the program on the approval of a waiver from the federal government to restrict the foods SNAP recipients can purchase. 
Senate File 232, which did not advance, would have allocated the funds to Double Up Food Bucks, with no conditions. 
School nutrition: House File 851 would have instructed the education department to seek a federal waiver from school nutrition guidelines to instead prioritize Iowa-specific foods like corn, pork and dairy. The bill advanced from the House in March, but was not taken up on the Senate floor. 
Rural grocery initiative: House File 1032 would have appropriated funds to establish a grocer reinvestment program and a local produce processing grant program under the Iowa Economic Development Authority. The bill advanced from the House April 24, but did not have a subcommittee meeting in the Senate. However, spending for the program was approved in the economic development budget bill, sent to the governor.

(Getty Images)A Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP) report shows that Florida would likely lose at least $1.6 billion in federal dollars for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and advocates are sounding the alarm.
Unless the Legislature chooses to backfill the loss of federal funds the reductions will force lawmakers either to cut eligibility for the program or reduce benefits if the U.S. House’s proposed reductions become effective.
The Florida Policy Institute (FPI) is  an independent, nonpartisan, nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing state policies and budgets that improve the economic mobility and quality of life for all Floridians. Florida Impact is a statewide anti-hunger policy organization. The groups issued a joint statement highlighting their concerns with the SNAP proposal as well as proposed Medicaid cuts.
“In Florida, more than 3.2 million people are food insecure, including over 807,000 kids, a number which will increase if the House’s plan to cut federal SNAP funding is enacted,” FPI CEO Sadaf Knight said in a written statement, relying on information from CBPP analyses.
The CBPP is a  nonpartisan research and policy institute that analyze federal budget priorities, with a particular focus on how budget choices affect people with low incomes.
“No child or adult in Florida should have to go hungry. Our congressional delegation should instead focus on improving the SNAP program so more families can put food on the table, and so that more communities can benefit from an economic boost as Floridians spend SNAP at local grocery stores and businesses.”
SNAP benefits have been 100% funded by the federal government. The CBPP reports that more than 2.9 million Floridians participate in SNAP, the average daily benefit at $6.12. 
Additionally, CBPP reports that more than 59% of Florida families participating in SNAP have children, and more than 41% of participating families include seniors or adults with disabilities.











These individuals are our neighbors, coworkers, loved ones, and friends. Florida’s future depends on ensuring that all Floridians thrive regardless of their zip code,

The budget proposal passed by the House Agricultural Committee this week cuts more than $290 billion from SNAP. Specifically, the bill includes a mandate that states pay between 5% and 25% of monthly SNAP benefit costs based on each state’s payment error rate.
Error rates measure  the accuracy of a state’s SNAP program. Error rates measure SNAP overpayments and underpayments.

U.S. House panel passes GOP plan that cuts Medicaid by $625B, adds work requirement

Florida’s error rate in 2023 was 12.6%, according to the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. Under terms of the legislation, the error rate would require Florida to cover 25% of the costs, or $1.6 billion in 2028 alone, the May 13 CBPP analysis shows.
Congress also is considering $625 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade. Many of the reductions would affect the Medicaid expansion population under the federal health care law know as Obamacare. Because Florida never expanded Medicaid to low income childless adults as allowed under the federal law, those provisions wouldn’t affect the state.
But Florida will be affected by a provision Congress is considering that limits provider taxes, which Florida relies on heavily to help fund its Medicaid program.
The combination of the Medicaid and SNAP cuts worries Asheena Moses, outreach and advocacy manager at Florida Impact.
“At Florida Impact, we’ve heard directly from families across the state who depend on Medicaid and SNAP to make ends meet. We’ve also seen how vital these programs are in local economies — supporting small businesses and community food providers who rely on SNAP revenue. Our partnerships with direct service organizations have shown us just how important Medicaid is for families’ health and stability,” Moses said in a statement.
“Any cuts to these programs would disproportionately harm low-income communities, affecting nearly 3 million SNAP participants and close to 4 million Medicaid enrollees — most of whom are hard working families already struggling to get by. These individuals are our neighbors, coworkers, loved ones, and friends. Florida’s future depends on ensuring that all Floridians thrive regardless of their zip code.”

(IEDC), Gov. Mike Braun’s office announced Wednesday.
The quasi-public entity is the subject of allegations, revealed in Indiana Legislative Insight reporting last month, of self-dealing, unreported side gigs and more. Just three days later, Braun promised a forensic audit.
In such audits, financial records are examined for any illegal activity and can serve as evidence in court. But the contract with FTI consulting is called “Forensic Review & Support Services” — and one provision says it isn’t an audit.

“While FTI’s work may include an analysis of financial and accounting data, the services will not include an audit, compilation or review of any kind of any financial statements or components thereof,” it reads.
Braun’s office didn’t immediately respond to a request for clarification.
The contract, worth up to $800,000, began May 13 and lasts one year. The consultant agreed to discount its standard hourly rates for all staff assigned to the project to a “blended hourly rate of $595.”
Commerce Secretary David Adams said last month that the forensic audit would be paid for by IEDC funds. Adams’ role includes serving as IEDC’s leader, but legislation taking effect July 1 separates the positions.
The review will be conducted “in cooperation with” the Indiana Office of Inspector General and the IEDC, governor’s office spokesman Griffin Reid said in a statement Thursday.
FTI Consulting will begin work “immediately,” Reid said.
“We do not anticipate any additional updates until completion of the audit,” he added.

(Photo: Jerry Redfern)The company at the center of a controversial green energy project connecting New Mexico and Arizona has changed plans for a key component: A much-debated pipeline that would have carried climate-friendly hydrogen will instead carry natural gas, and possibly a natural gas-hydrogen blend at a future date. Unlike hydrogen, natural gas, blended or not, contributes to climate warming both in its production and when it is burned for energy.
The pipeline is part of a much larger project by Tallgrass Energy Partners LP that would create a hydrogen economy centered in Farmington in the northwest corner of New Mexico. Plans include hydrogen production, a massive hub to inject carbon deep underground, repurposing a mothballed coal-fired power plant as a hydrogen-fired power plant, and pipelines connecting the various parts. The plans also included one pipeline to carry hydrogen across the Navajo Nation to markets in Arizona and farther afield.
 
Tallgrass decided to change what would be delivered in the pipeline earlier this year, and the news surprised many. Starting in 2021, the company, working through its subsidiary GreenView, carried out a public relations campaign along the proposed pipeline route through the Navajo Nation, hyping the green benefits of hydrogen. Switching to natural gas or a gas-hydrogen blend would dramatically reduce or eliminate those benefits. 	

This story originally appeared on Capital & Main and is republished with permission.


Tallgrass and GreenView also negotiated directly with the top level of the Navajo government about the project, most recently Navajo Nation President Buu Nygren. But when asked about the change to natural gas, Bidtah Becker, chief legal counsel for the president’s office, said, “It clearly was a decision that had been made long before we were informed.”
 

Common methods of producing hydrogen use natural gas as a feedstock, creating large quantities of climate-warming carbon dioxide.

 
Many embraced the project in a region that has seen declining oil and gas production and associated revenues from the surrounding San Juan Basin, as well as the closure of a large coal-fired power plant and its mine. The project also drew sharp skepticism on and off the Navajo Nation, where more than a century of industrial mineral extraction and production has failed to produce widespread economic benefits to residents.
Unlike fossil fuels, many see hydrogen as a miracle fuel. It produces only water vapor as a byproduct when run through an electrolyzer to make electricity and it produces no climate-warming carbon dioxide when burned, though it does emit other noxious air pollutants.
However, common methods of producing hydrogen use natural gas as a feedstock, creating large quantities of climate-warming carbon dioxide that need to be permanently buried underground — which is difficult, expensive and often unsuccessful — if the fuel is to be considered climate friendly.
Steven Davidson, vice president of government and public affairs at Tallgrass, said the change “does not indicate a departure from our commitment to clean hydrogen production and [carbon dioxide] sequestration. Instead, we are strategically positioning the project to meet both current and future energy demands.”
The change would make a pipeline capable of carrying natural gas and a blend of natural gas and hydrogen in the future, Davidson said: “In short, definitely no deviation from our focus on clean hydrogen as a decarbonization solution.”
That solution includes working with the Navajo Nation, he added. “We have invested four years of our time and resources in true partnerships to invest with the Navajo people,” he said. “We are a group of one in that respect.”
Joe Romm, a senior research fellow at the University of Pennsylvania’s Penn Center for Science, Sustainability and the Media and a former acting assistant secretary for energy efficiency and renewable energy at the U.S. Department of Energy, is doubtful about the project’s overall prospects.
“In the real world, you don’t see [projects] like this happen a lot, something so complicated,” he said. So big hydrogen projects are the result of “powerful backers. And the most powerful is the oil and gas industry.”
The complication starts with transporting blended gas.
“Blending doesn’t make a lot of sense. You can’t blend a lot” because the chemical nature of hydrogen “will basically tunnel through and destroy normal steel and a lot of other things,” Romm said.
By comparison, long-distance natural gas pipelines have been around for decades (though they aren’t risk-free).

Then there is the basic math of the most common method of making hydrogen from natural gas: steam methane reformation. According to researchers at Texas A&M University, it requires 3.16 kilograms of natural gas and another 9.74 kilograms of water to make a single kilogram of hydrogen. That process also creates 8.47 kilograms of climate-warming carbon dioxide. The formula doesn’t include the fuel needed to power the process or the energy needed to sequester the carbon dioxide to keep the hydrogen’s green credentials.
That carbon sequestration hub would be another sticking point because carbon capture projects are hard. “You can’t find a successful major carbon capture and storage [project],” Romm said.
Furthermore, natural gas production itself is an inherently leaky process, and the methane in the gas is 80 times more effective at trapping heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide.
With all of these complications inherent in hydrogen production and transport, Romm said, “Just pipe the natural gas.”
The pipeline change came at roughly the same time that a member of the Arizona Corporation Commission asked the commission to study building more natural gas pipelines and storage facilities for the state. Among other duties, the commission oversees pipeline safety and power utilities.
Nick Myers, the Arizona commission vice chair, said he hadn’t heard of the GreenView pipeline project when he asked the commission to study such projects. “To the extent I may have been informed, but don’t remember, it was only in passing,” he said. “I would love to talk to someone just to be in the loop.”
Tallgrass’ Davidson said, “We were not involved in the [commission’s] decision.” But, he added, “It’s not surprising,” considering that AI data centers alone are projected to consume up to 16.5% of the state’s power grid by 2030.
“None of the [other] pipelines that are proposed to be built into Arizona, to the best of our knowledge, provide any value to the Navajo Nation,” Davidson added.
So far, Myers’ February memo to the commission has prompted 17 letters on possible new natural gas infrastructure in Arizona. All but two were in favor, and six specifically mentioned the GreenView natural gas pipeline.
One of those letters was co-authored by New Mexico state Rep. Meredith Dixon (D-Albuquerque), who promoted and regularly voted in favor of fossil-fuel-friendly legislation during the state’s two-month legislative session earlier this year. She also cosponsored legislation that set up a framework for the state to manage carbon sequestration projects such as the planned CarbonSAFE hub in northwest New Mexico that’s part of Tallgrass’ overarching hydrogen project. (Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham signed the bill into law on April 7.)
 

For the past few years, grid-scale solar and wind energy have been cheaper to install than any fossil fuel.

 
Dixon’s co-author of both the letter and the legislation was state Sen. William Sharer (R-Farmington), the Senate minority floor leader and a longtime champion of oil and natural gas production. His district covers a large portion of the San Juan Basin in northwest New Mexico. Among the perceived benefits, the legislators championed the natural gas pipeline as “a unique opportunity to uplift the Navajo Nation,” despite the fact that oil and gas have been produced for more than 100 years on the economically challenged reservation. The letter doesn’t note them talking with anyone from the Nation, either.
In an email, Dixon said, “Even as [Sharer] and I disagree on some principles, we agree on the important role of carbon storage.”
Dixon didn’t say how she heard about the GreenView pipeline change, apparently before many on the Navajo Nation did. But she did offer reasons for supporting it: the argument of natural gas as a so-called “bridge fuel” (which is often–debunked); national and international security risks in light of the Russian invasion of Ukraine (which are debatable); and the real lack of other readily available power sources for energy-intensive manufacturing processes and transport.
Groups ranging from the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to the Rocky Mountain Institute support using hydrogen in energy-intensive industrial processes and heavy transport — but not elsewhere. That’s because for the past few years, grid-scale solar and wind energy have been cheaper to install than any fossil fuel. In fact, solar projects are growing across the Navajo Nation as part of a federal program to electrify Native lands. And the Environment America Research & Policy Center ranked New Mexico fourth in its top 10 list of states for renewable energy.
“My letter is intended to highlight potential opportunities created by this project,” Dixon said. “I fully expect Tallgrass to engage with all affected tribal and non-tribal communities.”
Three more letters that share similar structure and language and came from businesses on or near the Mexican border may be the work of LS2group, which calls itself “a bipartisan public relations, government affairs, public affairs, and marketing firm.”
Josh Rubin, the vice president of a cross-border manufacturing facilitator in Nogales, Arizona, 300 miles from the pipeline, told Capital & Main that a friend at LS2group asked him to send the letter, though he wasn’t overly familiar with the project.
A second letter, signed by a Holly Jensen claiming to own a Groovy Hues painting franchise in Tucson, couldn’t be verified. Neither name is affiliated with a registered business in Tucson, though there is a Groovy Hues 113 miles away in Phoenix, registered to a different person. And a call center operator for Groovy Hues said the company doesn’t do business in Tucson.
A third letter writer, Michael Sene, who runs a truck repair shop on the border, didn’t respond to a call and message from Capital & Main.
LS2group also did not return calls from Capital & Main.
Jessica Keetso (Diné) is deeply familiar with the GreenView project. For three years as an outreach coordinator for the Native group Tó Nizhóní Ání, or Sacred Water Speaks, she led an educational campaign opposing the hydrogen pipeline. (She recently left the group to attend law school.)
Even so, she first heard about the change from hydrogen to natural gas from Capital & Main, though she suspected something was in the works. “We knew something was happening because of how little presence Tallgrass had in the community” in recent months, she said.
“I think the Nation was always uncertain about the market for hydrogen,” she added. As for the pipeline change, “I think it’s really going to push the Navajo Nation for more benefits.”
Keetso said tribal agencies had already devoted a lot of time and energy working on the initial GreenView proposal, and changing the fuel could restart the whole process. She said that when she asked regulatory agencies on the Navajo Nation what would be required for changing the long-debated hydrogen pipeline to natural gas, they hadn’t heard of it.

The justices had before them three cases with injunctions levied by judges on Trump’s executive order to end birthright citizenship, from courts in Maryland, Massachusetts and Washington state. Under the 14th Amendment, all children born in the United States are considered citizens, regardless of their parents’ legal status.Trump’s order, originally planned to go into effect Feb. 19, said that children born in the United States would not be automatically guaranteed citizenship if their parents were in the country without legal authorization or if they were on a temporary legal basis such as a work or student visa.The justices questioned the practicality of a system in which judges can no longer issue nationwide injunctions and the logistics of instead having individuals file their own cases.Liberal justice Elena Kagan said that would create a chaotic system, and conservative justice Neil Gorsuch said it would produce a “patchwork” of suits and noted how long it takes for a class — a group of affected people — to be put together for a court case.Nationwide injunctions have stymied Trump’s agenda, but were also frequent during the Joe Biden administration. However, Trump has lashed out at judges who have blocked his actions, which in March prompted a rare response from conservative Chief Justice John Roberts on the importance of an independent judiciary.‘Stateless’ childrenIf the Supreme Court, dominated 6-3 by conservatives, decides that nationwide injunctions are not allowed in the birthright citizenship cases, it would temporarily create a patchwork of citizenship rules varying from state to state while the cases are litigated. Liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor said it would create a class of stateless people.“Thousands of children who are going to be born without citizenship papers that could render them stateless in some places because some of their parents' homes don't recognize children of their nationals unless those children are born in their countries,” she said.If birthright citizenship were to be eliminated, 255,000 children born each year would not be granted U.S. citizenship, according to a study by the think tank Migration Policy Institute.40 injunctions since Jan. 20Arguing on behalf of the Trump administration, U.S. Solicitor General D. John Sauer, in his opening remarks, noted that since Trump took office in January, there have been 40 nationwide injunctions.“Universal injunctions exceed the judicial power granted in Article III, which exists only to address the injury to the complaining party,” he said, referring to the Constitution. “They transgress the traditional balance of equitable authority, and it creates a host of practical problems.”Sauer touched on the merits of birthright citizenship, arguing that the 14th Amendment was only meant to grant citizenship to newly freed Black people, and not for immigrants in the country without legal authorization.“The suggestion that our position on the merits is weak is profoundly mistaken,” Sauer said. “That kind of snap judgment on the merits that was presented in the lower courts is exactly the problem with the issue of racing to issue these nationwide injunctions.”He said that the Trump administration would follow the high court’s ruling on birthright citizenship.

Sotomayor said that the Supreme Court has ruled four times to uphold birthright citizenship, starting in 1898, in United States v. Wong Kim Ark, in which the court ruled children born in the U.S. are citizens.The justice that seemed most inclined to agree with Sauer’s argument was conservative Clarence Thomas, who noted the use of nationwide injunctions began in the 1960s and the U.S. has survived without them.However, conservative Justice Samuel Alito criticized that district court judges “are vulnerable to an occupational disease, which is the disease of thinking that ‘I am right and I can do whatever I want.’”Citizenship ‘turned on and off’New Jersey Solicitor General Jeremy Feigenbaum, who represented the states that sought an injunction against the birthright citizenship order, laid out how the patchwork of citizenship means that citizenship would be “turned on” and off depending on state lines.“Since the 14th Amendment, our country has never allowed American citizenship to vary based on the state in which someone resides, because the post-Civil War nation wrote into our Constitution that citizens of the United States and of the states would be one and the same without variation across state lines,” he said.Immigrant rights’ groups and several pregnant women in Maryland who are not U.S. citizens filed the case in Maryland; four states — Washington, Arizona, Illinois, and Oregon — filed the case in Washington state; and 18 Democratic state attorneys general filed the challenge in Massachusetts.Those 18 states are California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Vermont and Wisconsin.Feigenbaum argued that the birthright citizenship case before the justices is the rare instance in which nationwide injunctions are needed because under a patchwork system, a burden would be created for states and local facilities such as hospitals where births occur.“We genuinely don't know how this could possibly work on the ground,” he said.

Kelsi Corkran, who argued on behalf of immigrant rights groups, said that the Trump order is ""blatantly unlawful,” and that a nationwide injunction against the executive order was warranted.“It is well settled that preliminary injunctions may benefit non-parties when necessary to provide complete relief to the plaintiffs or when warranted by extraordinary circumstances, both of which are true here,” she said.Corkran is the Supreme Court director at Georgetown’s Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection.This report will be updated.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-05-15 14:08:34.285004

(Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Lawmakers approved Nebraska’s $11 billion mainline budget for the next two years Thursday, leaving themselves with $1.1 million in wiggle room while controlling spending and moving enough money to cover the first two years of a projected deficit.
That figure includes $1.5 million in spending from LB 513, to give all state judges 1.5% salary increases in each of the next two years, which State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood, chair of the Legislature’s Appropriations Committee, anticipates passing.
On Thursday, no senators spoke during debate in favor of or to defend the budget bills — Legislative Bills 260, 261, 262, 263 and 265, as well as LB 534 to fund legal claims against the state — while multiple opponents said the budget was “supposedly” but not really balanced.

State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha, for example, predicted the bills wouldn’t stop the deficit and that a special session would be needed.
“This budget is based on a number of sleight of hands,” said State Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Omaha. “It is not actually balanced. We’re just making it look like it’s balanced.”
Clements said “there’s nothing” to indicate a special session would be needed unless there are “drastic actions” federally, hinting at possible congressional budget cuts. He said he was pleased with the result of the budget bills that funded salary increases and health insurance benefits for state employees and that state agencies were not “slashed.” 
‘An insurmountable mountain to climb’
Clements said his committee’s work put the state in “good financial shape” for the next two years in a budget-writing year that required extra work and he described as stressful. He said he was proud to protect funding for the Perkins County Canal and a new state prison.
“It seemed like an insurmountable mountain to climb, but we did it, and we also did not cut essential services,” Clements said.

LB 261, passed 37-11, and LB 264, passed 35-13, were the main budget bills. Because legislative rules required the budget to pass by the end-of-day Thursday, lawmakers made no last-minute changes, despite criticizing the bills for more than two hours. The bills now head to Gov. Jim Pillen, who can line-item veto any items. Overrides require at least 30 votes.
Clements said he had not been in communication with the Governor’s Office on whether to expect vetoes, or how many.
General fund estimates for the current fiscal year and the following two are:

Fiscal year 2024-25: $4.56 billion in net receipts, $5.48 billion in expenses.
Fiscal year 2025-26: $5.36 billion in net receipts, $5.48 billion in expenses.
Fiscal year 2026-27: $5.42 billion in net receipts, $5.52 billion in expenses.

Net receipts for the 2025-26 and 2026-27 fiscal years include $57.6 million in interest, $216 million in cash fund transfers and $147 million from the state’s “rainy day” cash reserve fund, which were used to help close the projected deficit.
Core criticisms
DeBoer compared the budget bills to the fairy tale “The Emperor’s New Clothes,” where the ruler is naked but his subjects pretend he has extravagant clothing.
“They talked about how great it is because they don’t want to be seen as unworthy,” DeBoer said, noting a young boy in the story called out the facade.
  State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha. Jan. 15, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
DeBoer and Cavanaugh argued the budget bills were littered with mistakes and unconstitutional provisions that were largely strewn together with sweeps of various cash funds in a budget that offered a two-year average spending growth of 0.9%. The two said some of the sweeps included funds from increased fees on Nebraskans.
Cavanaugh criticized moves to take about $2 million in interest from the administrative account for the Board of Educational Lands and Funds and $15 million in transfers from the Environmental Trust Fund. She proposed taking the amounts from the state’s “rainy day” cash reserve fund to avoid lawsuits for transfers she called unconstitutional.
She said officials overseeing the educational lands have said they might need to sue, and a former state official has suggested a lawsuit to protect the Environmental Trust.
At least $24 million of the budget gap is expected to be filled by seizing unspent agency funds after June 30, the end of the fiscal year. State Sen. Ashlei Spivey of Omaha said at least $7 million of that is contractually obligated in the Nebraska Department of Education.
Some senators have also said the budget doesn’t fully consider federal changes, such as in efforts to take away state-dedicated dollars for broadband expansion, because similar dollars came from the federal government. Some of those federal dollars are now at risk.

State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, who supported the budget, suggested lawmakers should have been looking at more cuts to prepare for major federal spending cuts, such as to Medicaid.
“It’s not about tightening our belt, as it is, we might be having to lop off limbs in order to help pay for our budget,” Hansen said.
‘Do better next time’
Spivey, a freshman member of the Appropriations Committee with Cavanaugh, said it would be “interesting” to see the budget implications, including for the years farther out, when lawmakers are projected to face a hole of at least $110 million under current projections.
“I hope, as we continue to work on our financial status and sustainability, that folks are more open to discourse and challenging ourselves around our decisions and our approach to how we create a responsible and responsive budget to our constituents,” Spivey said.
DeBoer said cash funds don’t sit around for no reason and expects a number of deficit requests next year that the Legislature might need to grapple with.
Of the budget’s passing, DeBoer, a senior member of the body, said: “I guess we need to learn this lesson to do better next time.”

The increases range from 2.5% to 4%, with Emporia State University declining to raise tuition in the 2025-2026 academic year. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Administrators of public universities in the Kansas Board of Regents system proposed student tuition increases for undergraduate resident students in the upcoming academic year ranging from 2.5% at Pittsburg State University to 4% at Fort Hays State University.
The outlier was Emporia State University, which responded to steady enrollment declines by requesting no increase in tuition for the second consecutive year.
To varying degrees, the six Board of Regents universities in Kansas grapple with a decline in the college-age population, an ongoing crash in international student enrollment, flat state appropriations, instability in federal research spending as well as inflation in operational costs, pressure to raise employee compensation and demands for substantive direct support of college athletics.
The nine-member Board of Regents has authority over tuition adjustments, but typically recommendations from campus leadership have been adopted.
Here are tuition rate increases proposed by university officials for in-state undergraduate students in the 2025-2026 academic year: University of Kansas, 3%; Kansas State University and Wichita State University, 3.5%; Pittsburg State University, 2.5%; and Fort Hays State University, 4%.
On Wednesday, FHSU President Tisa Mason said during a presentation to the Board of Regents the 4% hike at FHSU would balance financial responsibilities of the university with the capacity of students to afford college.
“We believe that the proposed tuition increase is essential for maintaining our high quality education and our student support services,” she said.
Board member Jon Rolph of Wichita asked whether Mason should consider a more aggressive tuition increase. FHSU historically maintained the state system’s lowest tuition rate due to revenue received from offering instruction to students in China, but the university found it necessary to raise undergraduate tuition by 7% in 2024 and 6% in 2025.
“Our students would loudly say, ‘No,'” Mason told Rolph. “They are feeling these increases right now.”
Ken Hush, president of Emporia State University, defended the decision to request no tuition increase. It meant ESU would go without a tuition rate hike in five of the past seven years. The university projected it would collect 0.4% less revenue from tuition next academic year compared to the current year, a reflection of erosion in enrollment as ESU restructured the university by firing tenured professors and eliminating academic programs.
Since 2016, tuition revenue to ESU has fallen by 26% while the six-university system overall generated an additional $140 million from tuition during that period.
“We are recommending a zero percent increase for the second year in a row,” said Hush, who indicated ESU’s budget factored in a possible 3% enrollment decline in the upcoming year.
Rolph, however, reiterated that he was concerned adopting less-than-necessary tuition increases at this juncture could lead to substantial spikes in the future to fill revenue gaps.
“Do you have that mapped out over two, three, four years where it’s stair-stepped?” Rolph said.
Hush said ESU was proud to offer a high-quality education with a tuition rate that moderated financial barriers faced by students.
“Our goal is to keep it flat from here on out,” Hush said. “We believe its moving in the right direction.”
Rick Muma, president at Wichita State University, said the 3.5% surge in tuition recommended to the Board of Regents reflected an attempt to navigate a difficult financial landscape. He pointed to leveling of investment from the state, uncertainty regarding federal appropriations, employee compensation that was 16% below market rates, the need to allocate $3.5 million to athletics programs and the anticipated reduction in international student enrollment.
“We are seeing the effects of decreased enrollment among international students,” he said. “This just didn’t start this year. It’s significant for us.”
Muma said the tuition increase could net WSU about $3.4 million annually, but the decline in international students could reduce revenue by $5.5 million annually. He said the university planned to implement a 4.8% budget reduction.
Kansas State President Richard Linton said tuition for in-state undergraduates would climb by 3.5%, but a 2.5% tuition increase would be applied to veterinary medicine students and an 8% increase would be sought for students on the aviation campus in Salina.
He expected KSU enrollment to climb 2% in the upcoming year, which would be a second consecutive year of growth following nine years of decline.
“The goal is to be working as hard as we can from a student-affordability standpoint,” Linton said.
KU Chancellor Doug Girod said the plan was to raise undergraduate tuition by 3% and boost student fees by 2%. These adjustments were in reaction to a projected 2.4% inflation rate, challenges with faculty salary compression, the flat state budget, reinvention of federal research funding and arrival of the long-anticipated enrollment decline tied to U.S. population trends. He expected KU also would experience a reduction among international students.
He said financial ramifications of these forces on higher education were difficult to fully predict, especially in terms of what could happen to student enrollment.
“I think the next two years are going to answer that question for all of us,” he said.
Tuition at the six universities in the Board of Regents’ system didn’t rise in 2020 and in 2023. In 2022, only KSU raised tuition. KU didn’t adopt a tuition increase from 2020 through 2023 before embracing increases of 5% in 2024 and 3.5% in the current academic year.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Board-of-Regents-1-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-15 14:08:34.285004

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — The geese that fly across the Department of Juvenile Justice’s long-term correctional campus inspired Jordan Thompson to start carving ducks out of wood.
Thompson, a 16-year-old from Anderson, was one of three boys at the department’s Broad River Road Complex on Wednesday showing off what he made in a woodworking class meant to prepare teenagers for jobs once they leave.
Like many of the program’s participants, he signed up because he needed an activity to fill his days after earning his GED diploma and found the work calming, he said.
When he’s feeling homesick, he turns to his woodwork to soothe him. Along with the ducks, Thompson carves crosses as a reminder to keep faith in God, he said.
“I put my emotions into it,” Thompson said.

Thompson’s ducks, alongside other student-made pieces of art and furniture, are put up for sale at the department’s Store of HOPE, an acronym for Helping Others Prepare for Employment. The store also runs a booth at Columbia’s outdoor farmers market, Soda City, about once a month.
All proceeds go back into the program, said Tonya Romriell, who has run the woodworking program for the past three years. Often, people walking through the booth at the market don’t realize the art is student-made until someone tells them, she said.
“Every time, it’s, ‘Wow, kids made this?’” Romriell said.

The program began in 2007, when some youth at the facility used wood leftover from a project with Habitat for Humanity to build Adirondack chairs, said her husband, Neal Romriell, who runs the Store of HOPE.
In 2012, the store opened to sell what the teens had created. More than a decade later, Adirondack chairs were still among the common creations sold.
Many of the supplies for the projects come from donations, and the state pays the program’s participants for their work, between $1 and $14 an hour, depending on their behavior. (They can increase their earnings by improving their behavior.)
Their earnings first go toward paying any court-ordered restitution they owe. The youth keep anything else they earn after they leave, according to the department.

Before the teens can join the program, they go through an interview process, just like they would to get a job outside the department. Participants must already have their diploma or equivalent certificate, so the work doesn’t distract from school. No woodworking or other crafting experience is necessary, said Tonya Romriell, the instructor.
“It’s a lot like a summer job, a first job,” Romriell said.
The number of teens in the program at any time can vary, from just a few to as high as 20.
Romriell doesn’t expect the teenagers she works with to become master craftsmen, she said.
She does expect them to pick up basic life skills they can use in any job. For instance, she teaches the teenagers in her program how to resolve conflicts with colleagues, how to talk to authority figures with respect and how to shake hands with a potential employer, she said.
The youth also get the confidence of knowing they’re capable of creating something people want to buy, Romriell said.

“It’s the first time for some of them that they made something they can be proud of and brag about,” she said.
Creative control is left up to the youth, Romriell said.
Those starting out or unsure of what to make can use preset designs, but Romriell is open to anything her students want to make, so long as it’s appropriate, she said.
Among the offerings Wednesday were wood-carved desk games, outdoor benches, cutting boards and decorative fish. Along with wood, the youth can work with metal, making Palmetto trees and wire words. Or, they can upholster furniture.
“They bring more to the table than I can even fathom,” Romriell said.

Like Thompson, 17-year-old Kayden Payton applied for the program will little experience.
The Abbeville teen always saw himself as a hands-on type of person, and he had once built a doghouse with his dad, so he was willing to give the program a shot, he said.
Payton started with a pre-designed Palmetto tree. He liked that, so he made more in different sizes, then moved onto signs that read “HOME” and “LOVE,” the Os replaced with the outline of South Carolina.

The work distracted him from whatever problems he was having that day, he said.
“It eased my mind from what’s going on around me,” Payton said.
The art is a reminder that people at DJJ’s long-term facility are capable of making “beautiful things,” no matter what they did to get there, Romriell said.
“Too often, we focus on what the boys have done and not what they’re capable of,” Romriell said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_3989-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-15 14:08:34.285004

(Photo courtesy EVHS)The union representing teachers at an Española high school has filed a complaint with the state labor board, alleging the school committed an unfair labor practice when it asked teachers to collect — and, soon after, delete — student immigration data in recent weeks.
As Source reported last month, the National Education Association initially issued a cease-and-desist letter to the Española School District superintendent regarding the high school’s effort to collect student immigration data as part of a standardized workplace readiness exam, though a spokesperson for the exam company told Source New Mexico that the company has no need for that information and does not ask test administrators to collect it. 
In response to the NEA letter, the superintendent told the union that teachers were no longer required to collect student immigration data. However, soon after, high school leaders “began requiring educators to delete the information they had previously collected regarding students’ immigration and citizenship statuses,” NEA spokesperson Edward Webster said in a news release Thursday. 
Española high school sought students’ immigration status as part of standardized test

Deleting the information amounted to “destruction of evidence during an open union investigation” and prompted the union to file a Prohibited Practice Complaint with the Public Employee Labor Relations Board of New Mexico. 
The new complaint alleges the school violated aspects of the Public Employee Bargaining Act of New Mexico, which defines unfair labor practices as those that violate employee rights and carry legal consequences. 
The state labor relations board had not yet scheduled a hearing for the case, according to its website. 
Española Superintendent Eric Spencer, who will retire in late June, did not respond to a list of questions Thursday from Source NM. He has previously said that his staff is working with the union on the matter and that, “The district takes all matters of student confidentiality seriously.”
According to the union, the emailed letter from the union cited the 1982 Plyler v. Doe U.S. Supreme Court case that guarantees the right to a free, public education for all children, regardless of their immigration status.
Mary Parr-Sanchez, NEA-NM president, said in a news release Thursday that the effort to collect student immigration information plays into the Trump administration’s targeting of immigrants. She noted that the Española school district and others around the state have students in different and precarious immigration statuses, including students brought to the United States as minors and others who are seeking asylum due to political persecution. 
“The current administration is targeting children in this country because of the color of their skin and origin of their birth,” Parr-Sanchez said in a statement.
“This is no different than the harassment that our Las Cruces students experienced when they were going to a swim meet in Albuquerque when ICE officers boarded their private bus and demanded proof of citizenship from children,” she said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/evhsfront_1000.jpg,,,2025-05-15 14:08:34.285004

Tate Reeves last week attended and spoke at a fundraiser for State Auditor Shad White, whose 2027 gubernatorial aspirations at this point are well known.
Reeves’ office in a statement said he’s not endorsing anyone yet to replace him after his final term in office, but his appearance at the White fundraiser at a wealthy patron’s home in Northeast Jackson spurred speculation among politicos that Reeves is aligning early with White. 
Over his many years in statewide office, including two terms as lieutenant governor, Reeves has most often kept his powder dry on endorsing or openly helping other statewide candidates in Republican primaries. But his criticism of another fellow Republican who has made his 2027 gubernatorial aspirations known, Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann, has some folks suspecting Reeves is getting out front early supporting White to thwart Hosemann’s aspirations.
“The governor often supports — financially and otherwise — elected officials throughout the state with whom he regularly works with to improve the state he loves,” Reeves’ Deputy Chief of Staff Cory Custer said in a statement. “Auditor White certainly meets that criteria.
“But, no, the governor has not made any endorsements for any office in the 2027 Mississippi elections,” Custer said.
White was ebullient over the governor’s assist at the fundraiser.
“I was honored to have Gov. Reeves attend the fundraiser,” White said in a statement. “We have tons of momentum as a state but big new challenges on the horizon that will require energy and grit from our next crop of elected officials, something he and I have discussed at length, so I was proud he chose to come to the event. It was the most successful fundraiser I’ve had in my time as state auditor.”
Jockeying and fundraising for Mississippi’s 2027 statewide elections is entering full swing, with politicians eyeing open seats for governor, lieutenant governor and potentially others through a domino effect.
Besides White and Hosemann, other Republicans considering a run for governor in bright-red Mississippi include Attorney General Lynn Fitch, Agriculture Commissioner Andy Gipson, former U.S. Rep. Gregg Harper, former House Speaker Philip Gunn and billionaire businessman Tommy Duff. 
The potential entre into the race of Duff, the state’s co-wealthiest person along with his brother, will be a linchpin for the 2027 governor’s race. The prospect of running against someone who could easily write his own campaign an eight-figure check would likely cause all but the most confident, foolhardy or well-funded candidates to waive off a run and pick another office.
The political chatter of late has been that Duff, who has toyed with a gubernatorial run in past cycles, will not run in 2027. But Duff’s recent actions would appear to belie this. He has been traveling across the state and attending events in a very campaign-like manner for months. Duff also formed a PAC late last year that is already helping GOP candidates in local elections across the state in 2025, including running an ad in the heated Gulfport mayoral race between Republican Hugh Keating and Democrat Sonya Williams Barnes and donating $25,000 to the House Leadership Fund.
With some gubernatorial hopefuls considering a plan B, and an also open lieutenant governor seat, the field for the No. 2 spot in state government could become very crowded. Besides aforementioned potential gubernatorial candidates, numerous others, including Secretary of State Michael Watson, Treasurer David McRae, state Sen. Briggs Hopson III and others are considered potential lieutenant governor candidates.
One name often mentioned lately for a potential run for lieutenant governor, attorney general — you name it — is Deputy Attorney General Whitney Lipscomb. Lipscomb, who was previously deputy chief of staff and legal counsel for former Gov. Phil Bryant, has also been widely rumored as a likely pick by President Donald Trump for one of Mississippi’s two U.S. Attorney spots.
Democrats, who do not currently hold a statewide elected office in Mississippi, have at times struggled to field competitive candidates. But many suspect former Public Service Commissioner Brandon Presley, who ran against Reeves in the last gubernatorial race, might try again. State House Minority Leader Robert Johnson is often mentioned as a potential lieutenant governor candidate.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/15114642/AP24009673109722.jpg,,,2025-05-15 13:21:29.773353

Tim Walz, Senate Majority Leader Erin Murphy and bipartisan House leaders announced a budget deal on Thursday that includes significant cuts to spending on health, human services and transportation. 
But, with four days left in the legislative session, the agreement does not appear to have the support required to pass the Senate. A special session is likely.
Walz, GOP House Speaker Lisa Demuth, DFL House leader Melissa Hortman and Senate Majority Leader Erin Murphy signed the agreement released Thursday. Senate Minority Leader Mark Johnson, R-East Grand Forks, did not sign the budget agreement and did not attend the press conference with the other legislative leaders. 
Johnson released a statement Thursday morning, which said, in part: “While the final deal includes some needed reforms, it falls short of acknowledging we need bipartisan support to stop the harmful progressive policies hurting small businesses and working families.”
Progressive Democratic senators have also signaled they will not vote for the budget deal. 
As Walz and legislative leaders held a press conference announcing the budget agreement, progressive Democrats of the People of Color and Indigenous Caucus and activists chanted outside the room and banged on the door to the room where the press conference was taking place. 
Protesters chanted “don’t kill immigrants” and “One Minnesota, right?” — a dig at the governor’s 2018 election slogan.
Given the slim Senate DFL majority, 34-33, Murphy needs either her entire caucus or Republican votes, and it wasn’t clear Thursday morning that she had either.
Senate progressives were outraged that the agreement would end access to state-subsidized health insurance, MinnesotaCare, for undocumented adults. Undocumented children would remain eligible for the program. 
The budget agreement outlines the spending targets for each state agency. The overall budget for 2026-2027 would be around $66 or $67 billion, several billion smaller than the previous two-year budget, said Ahna Minge, the state budget director.
It would also eliminate the majority of the projected deficit for the budget starting in 2028, assuming the next class of lawmakers follows through on the cuts outlined in Thursday’s agreement.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MG_9158-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-05-15 13:21:29.773353

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)In the wake of President Donald Trump’s executive order aiming to reinstate “common sense” school discipline, more states may follow and expand the authority of teachers and school officials to deal with disruptive students.
The order, signed in April, repeals prior federal guidance that encouraged schools to address racial disparities in discipline, arguing that such policies promoted “discriminatory equity ideology” and compromised school safety by pressuring administrators to underreport serious student misconduct.
In some states, new legislation already is trending toward giving teachers more authority to address student misbehavior.
Shaken by post-pandemic disruptions, some states take a harder line on school discipline

In West Virginia, for example, a new law creates a structured process for responding to violent, threatening or disruptive behavior among students in grades K-6.
Under the law, a student exhibiting such behavior can be immediately removed from class, evaluated by counselors or behavioral specialists and placed on an individualized behavior plan. If there’s no improvement after two rounds of intervention, the student could be moved into a behavioral intervention program or an alternative learning environment.
West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey, a Republican, and supporters say the law empowers teachers to maintain safe classrooms.
“This legislation provides teachers with the tools to regain control of the classroom and ensure safe learning environments for our kids,” Morrisey said at the bill’s signing.
In April, the Texas House of Representatives passed a bill referred to as the “Teacher’s Bill of Rights” with a bipartisan vote of 124-20.
That bill, now sitting in the Senate’s education committee, would significantly expand the grounds for out-of-school suspensions, allowing students to be suspended for repeated disruptions or threats beginning in third grade. It would reverse earlier changes that limited suspensions for younger students. It also would mandate that students making terroristic threats or assaulting school employees be placed in alternative education programs for at least 30 days.
Texas civil rights groups argue that the bill would impose a one-size-fits-all punitive approach, rather than addressing students’ developmental and behavioral needs.
Alycia Castillo, associate director of policy at the Texas Civil Rights Project and a former teacher, said state lawmakers are taking the wrong approach by mandating sweeping discipline policies for a state as diverse as Texas.










Discipline is the backbone of effective learning.


– Jessica Bartnick, co-founder and CEO of Foundation for C.H.O.I.C.E.


During the 2020-21 school year, according to the latest data available from the U.S. Department of Education, Black students faced the highest rates of disciplinary action across all categories — suspension and expulsion — among all racial and ethnic groups.
They were 39% more likely than white students to receive in-school suspensions, 70% more likely to face out-of-school suspensions, and 71% more likely to be expelled.
The disparities were even starker for Black students with disabilities, who experienced suspension and expulsion rates far exceeding those of both their white peers and non-disabled students.
Reviving old, harsh disciplinary policies risks disproportionately harming students of color, students with disabilities and those from low-income backgrounds, Castillo said.
“What works in Austin may not work in West Texas,” Castillo said.
“Children are naturally disruptive — that’s part of their development,” she added. “Excluding them only harms their growth into functional adults.”
 Restorative justice models

In recent years, some other states have passed laws promoting restorative practices in schools, in which students and teachers work through problems and focus on repairing the harm caused by disruptions or conflict.
Hundreds of SC preschoolers suspended each year for offenses like hitting, spitting

Michigan’s 2017 law requires schools to consider restorative approaches before suspensions or expulsions, aiming to repair harm rather than exclude students. Nevada began mandating restorative justice approaches in 2019, but scaled back that approach in 2023.
This year, Maryland passed a law requiring the state to establish “restorative practices schools,” specific schools with trained educators who use the approach in everyday discipline.
Kimberly Hellerich, an assistant professor at Sacred Heart University and a former K-12 teacher, said discipline policies should go beyond punitive measures to foster accountability and community healing.
“Adding restorative practices to accompany codes of conduct can allow students to recognize the impact of their actions on themselves, peers, the teacher, the class and the school community,” Hellerich said.
In her own classrooms, Hellerich used what she called “community circles” to guide students in processing behavior, offering apologies and rebuilding trust. “The apology served as a way to restore the student’s relationship with the entire class community,” she said.
 A warning about low expectations

While lawmakers debate discipline procedures, other education advocates warn that an even deeper issue is unfolding inside classrooms: the gradual erosion of behavioral expectations and academic rigor.
Some SC school districts won’t give grades below 50. Legislation would ban such policies.

Jessica Bartnick, co-founder and CEO of the Dallas-based mentorship program Foundation for C.H.O.I.C.E., said that declining school discipline and lowered standards are quietly undermining educational outcomes.
“Discipline is the backbone of effective learning,” Bartnick, who supports the Texas legislation, told Stateline in an email. “Without it, classrooms become chaotic, instructional time is lost and teachers are forced to shift their focus from instruction to behavior management.”
Bartnick said efforts to promote equity sometimes inadvertently lower behavioral standards and deprive teachers of the tools they need to maintain safe learning environments.
She also criticized lenient grading policies and unlimited test retakes, arguing that they diminish the value of preparation, responsibility and resilience.
“If students are shielded from the discomfort of failure, they are also shielded from the growth that comes with it,” she wrote. “If we want to prepare students for a world that will not offer endless second chances, we must return to a classroom culture grounded in discipline, responsibility, and rigor.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-05-15 16:54:40+00:00,Mississippi Today,Citizens call for Rankin sheriff and supervisor to resign,"Steph Quinn, Mukta Joshi and Jerry Mitchell",,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/05/15/citizens-call-for-rankin-sheriff-and-supervisor-to-resign/,Several Rankin County citizens called for Supervisor Steve Gaines to resign because of remarks that some have called racist.,"At Thursday’s standing-room-only Board of Supervisors’ meeting, several Rankin County citizens called for Supervisor Steve Gaines to resign because of remarks that some have called racist.
The Rev. Ava Harvey, pastor for the Pilgrim Rest Missionary Baptist Church in Brandon, called for “an honest apology and an honorable resignation” by Gaines, saying, “It is time for our county to heal.” 
In 2023, five of Sheriff Bryan Bailey’s deputies, some of whom called themselves the “Goon Squad,” beat, tased and sexually assaulted Eddie Parker and his friend, Michael Jenkins, before shooting Jenkins in the mouth during a mock execution. The deputies tried to plant a BB gun and drugs on the men to cover up their crimes, but they were ultimately convicted and sent to federal prison for decades.
On May 1, the sheriff’s department’s lawyer, Jason Dare, announced that Rankin County had negotiated a $2.5 million settlement with Parker and Jenkins. Two days later, Gaines praised the settlement and Dare.
“He beat the pants off of those guys—the dopers, the people that raped and doped your daughters,” Gaines told the nearly all-white crowd of 100 gathered at the sheriff’s breakfast. “He beat their pants off.”
Malik Shabazz, a lawyer for Parker and Jenkins, called Gaines’ remarks racist and said his clients are considering a defamation lawsuit.
On May 13, Gaines released a statement saying that his comments were “not aimed at anyone personally.”

At the Thursday meeting, Harvey said it’s obvious that Gaines was speaking of the two men. “If you were not referring to Mr. Eddie Parker and Michael Jenkins, who were you referring to?” he asked Gaines. “If you’re not speaking specifically to the case that the lawyer was involved in, then exactly who is it? Is there another case out here that no one knows about?”
After Rankin County residents experienced the initial shock of what happened to Jenkins and Parker, there was “utter disgust, complete dismay” and “frayed trust” between the community and the sheriff, he said. “Goon Squad is now a household name.”
Some power brokers in Rankin County have urged Gaines to resign, but he gave no indication Thursday he would do so.
An investigation by Mississippi Today and The New York Times exposed a decades-long reign of terror that involved at least 20 Rankin County deputies, several of whom routinely tortured suspected drug users to elicit information and confessions.
Many people have filed lawsuits alleging abuses by deputies, or say they filed complaints with the department or reported these incidents directly to Bailey, but the sheriff has denied any knowledge of these alleged abuses.
Last September, the Justice Department opened an investigation into the sheriff’s department’s practices, but in January, the current administration’s department ordered the Civil Rights Division to halt any litigation or new cases. The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Jackson did not respond to requests for comment on whether the probe would continue.

The state auditor’s office launched an investigation after Mississippi Today reported on Bailey’s alleged misuse of taxpayer money equipment and supplies used at his mother’s commercial chicken farm.
Outside the meeting, one protester, John Osborne of Jackson, whose son frequents Rankin County, held a sign criticizing Gaines. “Steve Gaines claimed that Michael Jenkins and Eddie Parker raped and doped your daughters,” the sign read. “Steve Gaines lied.”
“It isn’t just about the racist trope,” Osborne said. “Gaines’ comments were a celebration of what happened to those two men.”
He said when Gaines made those comments at the May 3 breakfast meeting, “Bryan Bailey did not stand up and say those comments were wrong.”
Addressing the supervisors, Fred Chambliss, a federal correctional officer who became a whistleblower, questioned why Gaines had bragged about a $2.5 million settlement of a case in which “somebody got shot in the mouth, sexually assaulted, basically raped, waterboarded.”
“If you are bold enough to say that in a meeting, what else are y’all talking about behind closed doors?” he asked. 
Leon Seals, who has complained about being tased by Pearl police and is now running for alderman, said if citizens are held accountable, “police officers should be held accountable, or the supervisor members should be held accountable.”
In 2023, Harvey ran against Gaines for supervisor for District Four, the largest district in the county, stretching from east of Brandon to the northeast corner. Gaines, a Republican, won three-fourths of the vote over Harvey, who ran as an independent.
Harvey called the supervisor’s remarks disheartening. “I just do not believe the majority of people in District Four agree with his statement,” he said. “Mr. Gaines has now again brought national attention to our county unnecessarily.”
In an interview with Mississippi Today, Harvey said Gaines’ remarks still make it more difficult for Black Mississippians to navigate life in Rankin County. 
“How am I being viewed by my neighbors?” he asked. “Am I being viewed as a rapist? Am I being viewed as a doper? Is this the type of behavior that my neighbor now endorses, and people that I go to church with?”
Over the past several years, Rankin County has been “trying to go through this healing process” after all of the abuses by the Goon Squad, only for Gaines to “pull the scab right back off,” he said. “We just can’t seem to get past this dark cloud that’s just hanging over our county.”
He said both Gaines and Bailey should step down. Harvey said he may run against Gaines in 2027, saying the county needs better representation and new leadership to restore trust and improve the county’s reputation. 
“This is beyond bad judgment. This is beyond incompetence,” he said. “This is just reprehensible.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/15103703/IMG_0445-1.jpg,,,2025-05-15 13:21:29.773353

(Niki Kelly/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita issued a letter on Thursday accusing the University of Notre Dame of potentially violating discrimination laws as well as jeopardizing its nonprofit status. 
This is the second time the university has come under fire this year regarding its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies. In March, the U.S. Department of Education included Notre Dame among 50 universities targeted for allegedly using racial preferences and stereotypes in education programs, according to WSBT. In that investigation, the university could face losing federal funding if found in violation. 
At the time the university released a statement saying “As always, The University of Notre Dame follows the law and in no way practices or condones discrimination. As a Catholic university, we are fully committed to defending the dignity of every human person and ensuring that every person can flourish.”
Rokita’s letter alleges that Notre Dame’s 2023 Strategic Framework and public materials suggest discriminatory practices, including differential treatment based on race or ethnicity.
In the letter, he also points to the universities’ efforts to boost “underrepresented” student and faculty members, track enrollment in courses taught by faculty who “look like” underrepresented students, and host racially segregated “multicultural recognition ceremonies” for graduates. He argues these practices breach Indiana’s anti-discrimination laws and federal laws, specifically in light of the 2023 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard that imposed restrictions on race-based admissions. 
“Notre Dame’s DEI policies raise troubling questions about whether, in its pursuit of DEI goals, the university may be crossing the clear line that Indiana law draws against racial discrimination. I am seeking answers,” Rokita said in the letter. 
The office requested detailed documentation and information including admissions and hiring practices, changes made to its practices following the Students for Fair Admissions decision, guidance it provides to faculty and admission staff on its DEI goals and an explanation on whether and how race plays a role in recruiting, hiring and enrollment. 
Rokita asked Notre Dame to respond by June 9. If the university does not respond, the office could take legal action against the university and jeopardize its nonprofit status.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/468299097_10160739210542253_1012901555041309062_n-1.jpg,,,2025-05-15 13:21:29.773353

In the wake of President Donald Trump’s executive order aiming to reinstate “common sense” school discipline, more states may follow and expand the authority of teachers and school officials to deal with disruptive students.
The order, signed in April, repeals prior federal guidance that encouraged schools to address racial disparities in discipline, arguing that such policies promoted “discriminatory equity ideology” and compromised school safety by pressuring administrators to underreport serious student misconduct.
In some states, new legislation already is trending toward giving teachers more authority to address student misbehavior.

In West Virginia, for example, a new law creates a structured process for responding to violent, threatening or disruptive behavior among students in grades K-6.
Under the law, a student exhibiting such behavior can be immediately removed from class, evaluated by counselors or behavioral specialists and placed on an individualized behavior plan. If there’s no improvement after two rounds of intervention, the student could be moved into a behavioral intervention program or an alternative learning environment.
West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey, a Republican, and supporters say the law empowers teachers to maintain safe classrooms.
“This legislation provides teachers with the tools to regain control of the classroom and ensure safe learning environments for our kids,” Morrisey said at the bill’s signing.
In April, the Texas House of Representatives passed a bill referred to as the “Teacher’s Bill of Rights” with a bipartisan vote of 124-20.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
That bill, now sitting in the Senate’s education committee, would significantly expand the grounds for out-of-school suspensions, allowing students to be suspended for repeated disruptions or threats beginning in third grade. It would reverse earlier changes that limited suspensions for younger students. It also would mandate that students making terroristic threats or assaulting school employees be placed in alternative education programs for at least 30 days.
Texas civil rights groups argue that the bill would impose a one-size-fits-all punitive approach, rather than addressing students’ developmental and behavioral needs.
Alycia Castillo, associate director of policy at the Texas Civil Rights Project and a former teacher, said state lawmakers are taking the wrong approach by mandating sweeping discipline policies for a state as diverse as Texas.











Children are naturally disruptive — that’s part of their development.


– Alycia Castillo, associate director of policy at the Texas Civil Rights Project



During the 2020-21 school year, according to the latest data available from the U.S. Department of Education, Black students faced the highest rates of disciplinary action across all categories — suspension and expulsion — among all racial and ethnic groups.
They were 39% more likely than white students to receive in-school suspensions, 70% more likely to face out-of-school suspensions, and 71% more likely to be expelled.
The disparities were even starker for Black students with disabilities, who experienced suspension and expulsion rates far exceeding those of both their white peers and non-disabled students.
Reviving old, harsh disciplinary policies risks disproportionately harming students of color, students with disabilities and those from low-income backgrounds, Castillo said.
“What works in Austin may not work in West Texas,” Castillo said.
“Children are naturally disruptive — that’s part of their development,” she added. “Excluding them only harms their growth into functional adults.”

Restorative justice models

In recent years, some other states have passed laws promoting restorative practices in schools, in which students and teachers work through problems and focus on repairing the harm caused by disruptions or conflict.

Michigan’s 2017 law requires schools to consider restorative approaches before suspensions or expulsions, aiming to repair harm rather than exclude students. Nevada began mandating restorative justice approaches in 2019, but scaled back that approach in 2023.
This year, Maryland passed a law requiring the state to establish “restorative practices schools,” specific schools with trained educators who use the approach in everyday discipline.
Kimberly Hellerich, an assistant professor at Sacred Heart University and a former K-12 teacher, said discipline policies should go beyond punitive measures to foster accountability and community healing.
“Adding restorative practices to accompany codes of conduct can allow students to recognize the impact of their actions on themselves, peers, the teacher, the class and the school community,” Hellerich said.
In her own classrooms, Hellerich used what she called “community circles” to guide students in processing behavior, offering apologies and rebuilding trust. “The apology served as a way to restore the student’s relationship with the entire class community,” she said.

Calls for a cultural shift on expectations

While lawmakers debate discipline procedures, other education advocates warn that an even deeper issue is unfolding inside classrooms: the gradual erosion of behavioral expectations and academic rigor.










Discipline is the backbone of effective learning.


– Jessica Bartnick, co-founder and CEO of Foundation for C.H.O.I.C.E.


Jessica Bartnick, co-founder and CEO of the Dallas-based mentorship program Foundation for C.H.O.I.C.E., said that declining school discipline and lowered standards are quietly undermining educational outcomes.
“Discipline is the backbone of effective learning,” Bartnick, who supports the Texas legislation, told Stateline in an email. “Without it, classrooms become chaotic, instructional time is lost and teachers are forced to shift their focus from instruction to behavior management.”
Bartnick said efforts to promote equity sometimes inadvertently lower behavioral standards and deprive teachers of the tools they need to maintain safe learning environments.
She also criticized lenient grading policies and unlimited test retakes, arguing that they diminish the value of preparation, responsibility and resilience.
“If students are shielded from the discomfort of failure, they are also shielded from the growth that comes with it,” she wrote. “If we want to prepare students for a world that will not offer endless second chances, we must return to a classroom culture grounded in discipline, responsibility, and rigor.”

(Michigan Advance)A Maine lawmaker introduced a late-session, bipartisan bill that she hopes will address what she called the “twin challenges” of high energy costs and harmful fossil fuel emissions.
Sen. Anne Carney (D-Cumberland) outlined the several ways LD 1949 will address those problems during a public hearing Thursday before the Legislature’s Energy, Utilities and Technology Committee. It includes protections for vulnerable populations against power disconnection, enhanced utility accountability and environmental justice requirements. 
“Taken on the whole, the intent is really to make sure that we are having and working toward a system that works as well for customers as it does for energy executives,” said Lucy Hochschartner, climate and clean energy director for Maine Conservation Voters, who spoke in support of the bill.
Though the Office of Public Advocate, the Governor’s Energy Office and the Public Utilities Commission said the intent of the legislation is commendable, they all testified neither for nor against the bill and raised concerns about unintended consequences of the sweeping proposal. The commission and the Office of Public Advocate recommended carrying the bill over to the next session to allow for more time to refine the details. 
The public hearing comes just one day before the deadline for committees to submit their carry-over requests to the presiding officers. However, that deadline is somewhat of a moving target and the presiding officers have final say over what can be pushed to the second regular session, which begins January 2026. 
Carney described her bill to the committee as “a meaningful step toward making sure our energy systems work for everyone, not just those who can afford to keep up.” To take that step, the legislation has four parts, with the first seeking to bolster overcharge and disconnection protections for ratepayers. 
Lawmaker argues it’s a ‘moral imperative’ to address high energy costs alongside climate change

The legislation would prohibit utilities from disconnecting services for customers who haven’t paid, if the customer is 65 years or older, experiencing financial hardship, has certain medical conditions, attempted to access an assistance program or has a child under the age of 1 living there.
Versant Power, one of Maine’s two largest private utility companies, opposed the bill, citing multiple concerns, including that the disconnection provisions could increase costs for other ratepayers and could violate customer privacy, given the health and age details those new provisions could hinge on. 
Carney’s legislation also hopes to address an issue raised in a recent annual report from the Maine Office of the Public Advocate. Per that report, between 2016 and 2023, competitive providers charged households $135 million more than what would have been charged by the standard offer for electricity supply. 
To prevent that and ensure that assistance program dollars aren’t being overspent, Carney said the bill would prohibit competitive electricity providers from entering into a contract with a household that has received low-income assistance unless the Public Utilities Commission finds that the customer would in fact receive a lower rate.
The second portion of LD 1949 seeks to strengthen utility accountability by limiting what expenses can be passed onto ratepayers. These include costs related to travel, lodging and food for utility company officers, among other expenditures related to investor relations and rate case proceedings. 
Though aimed at energy utilities, the Maine Water Utilities Association said it would also be swept up into the requirements outlined in the proposal. Water utilities in Maine are typically small and only receive revenue through rates, so David Parent, superintendent of the Sanford Water District, said the limitations on what costs can be passed onto ratepayers would pose challenges for them. 
He also said most water utilities likely won’t have the software needed to track the demographics to consider in disconnections. 
Unless the bill is amended to carve out water utilities, Parent asked the committee not to move forward with the legislation. 
Because accurate data is key to ensuring utility laws benefit Maine people, Carney said her proposal also includes improved reporting metrics. Under her bill, utilities with over 50,000 customers would be required to file quarterly reports with the Public Utilities Commission with information on overdue accounts, disconnections, reconnections and payment plans. 
The commission would also be required to conduct proceedings at least once every five years to review the administrative charges collected by the utility companies. 
The final piece of LD 1949 targets the other side of the dual challenge Carney outlined by requiring the Public Utilities Commission to incorporate environmental justice principles into its work. There is a lengthy definition for “environmental justice” included in the bill to mean fair treatment of all people with respect to the implementation and enforcement of environmental laws. 
The legislation also includes a labor component by requiring that a certain percentage of labor hours for construction and repair projects for energy generation facilities are performed by qualified apprentices. 
Reed & Reed, a construction company that has built numerous wind energy projects in the state, opposed the bill largely because of the last section. Since the company has struggled to retain a workforce in some of the most rural parts of the state, they argued the apprenticeship requirements seem unsustainable.

A new pharmacy in Jackson will distribute medication to patients free of charge.
The St. Vincent de Paul Community Pharmacy – a “pharmacy of last resort” – provides free prescription services and wellness education to Mississippians who can not afford their medications.
“We are here for individuals that have exhausted all available means to get their prescription medicine on their own,” said executive director Samuel Burke at the pharmacy’s dedication Wednesday. 
The pharmacy will operate as a partnership between St. Vincent de Paul Community Pharmacy, St. Dominic Health and Stewpot Community Services, a homeless shelter and social service organization in downtown Jackson. 
It is the pharmacy’s third site in the state, joining locations in Hattiesburg and Biloxi. The organization chose to open the Jackson location due to the capital city’s high poverty rates, Burke said. 
The pharmacy, which is licensed by the Mississippi Board of Pharmacy and operates like any other retail pharmacy, distributes generic medications included on its formulary free of charge to patients. All staff members, including the pharmacist, are volunteers. 
Most medications are purchased wholesale with the support of donations.
“I tell folks all the time I have a terrible business model,” said Burke. “I raise money, I buy medicines, I give it away and then I do it all over again. But that’s what we’re here (for) and we’re called to do.”
The pharmacy also distributes unused prescriptions from nursing homes that would otherwise be destroyed, which is allowed by state law. The pharmacy currently has partnerships with four nursing facilities and expects this number to grow.
Individuals can be referred by clinics, the emergency room or their doctor or can ask for their prescription to be sent directly to the pharmacy without a referral. To receive continued assistance, clients must undergo an eligibility screening process. 
A free shuttle runs to the pharmacy Thursdays from Sister Trinita Community Clinic in downtown Jackson, which provides primary care health services to low-income families and homeless individuals. 
Burke said St. Vincent de Paul Community Pharmacy is the only multi-facility storefront charity pharmacy that allows patients to receive recurring services in the state. 
The need for such services is great, he said, because many Mississippians struggle to afford their prescriptions or choose between paying for their prescriptions and other important expenses. 
“We all know that we could open five, 10, 16, however many more, and there would still be a need,” Burke said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/14121418/3X0A9715.jpg,,,2025-05-15 12:17:38.550350

They also sealed the fate of a litany of bills. 
Among the final-day casualties: 
– A massive incentive package designed to convince the Chiefs and Royals to stay in Missouri; 
– An  bill clarifying that a judge can’t prevent a divorce from being finalized just because a woman is pregnant; 
– An effort to reenact a law penalizing Missouri police for enforcing federal gun laws.
It was the 5th year in a row the Senate was unable to make it to the 6 p.m. Friday constitutional deadline for the session to adjourn. Even the House decided to adjourn early, announcing that it would work on bills Thursday then head home for the year.
It marks the first time the House has not worked on the legislative session’s final day since a fixed adjournment date was set in 1952. 
House Speaker Jon Patterson, a Lee’s Summit Republican, said despite the Wednesday meltdown, the Senate actually functioned much better than any year since he joined the legislature. 
“With the Senate, you just have to keep your expectations in check,” he said. “But I’m actually very happy with the way things went. You can’t always end the way you want.”
After years of the Senate’s discord being caused by internal GOP squabbles, Republican leaders celebrated soon after the early adjournment Wednesday by touting party unity and a host of big-ticket accomplishments. 
They pointed to legislation sent to the governor enacting state control of the St. Louis police, exempting capital gains from the income tax and pumping $50 million into a private school voucher program, among others. 
“This session proved what’s possible when Republicans lead together,” said Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin, a Shelbina Republican. 
But after a mostly placid legislative session, which O’Laughlin noted last week was marked by solid cooperation with Senate Democrats, the decision to cut off debate in order to roll back two voter-approved initiatives could have long-lasting consequences. 
“It’s sad. We tried. We tried to negotiate all session on these issues,” said Senate Minority Leader Doug Beck, an Affton Democrat, later adding: “You think things are going back to business as usual. I’ve heard a long time, ‘well, nobody has ever made us pay.’ You’ll find out now.”
 Senate Minority Leader Doug Beck speaks about negotiations on a bill that seeks to establish a constitutional amendment to ban abortion (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
Republicans cut off debate using a procedural maneuver known as “calling the previous question,” or PQ. 
Used regularly in the Missouri House, it is used rarely in the Senate because the chamber has a tradition of unlimited debate and negotiations over difficult issues. Wednesday was the first time since 2020 when a PQ was invoked and the first time since 2017 when it was used during a regular session.
Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe spent the session’s final days trying to avoid a PQ and win support for his plan to help finance stadiums for the Chiefs and Royals.
Kehoe formally rolled out his plan Tuesday morning to cover up to half of the cost of a new stadium for the Royals and a refurbished Arrowhead Stadium for the Chiefs. 
It easily cleared the House, but when it landed in the Senate, it ran into a wall of resistance. 
Looking for a path forward on stadium funding, Kehoe began pushing for a compromise that could lead to a vote on his plan along with paid sick leave and abortion. 
Democrats agreed to end their filibuster and allow Republicans to repeal the paid sick leave law — which voters approved in November and went into effect May 1 — as long the minimum wage would continue to be indexed to inflation. 
They also were willing to let Republicans put an abortion ban constitutional amendment on the statewide ballot if they agreed to remove a provision purporting to ban gender-affirming care for minors, something that is already illegal in Missouri.
A repeal of Missouri’s abortion ban was approved by voters in November, and Planned Parenthood clinics have restarted surgical abortions for those up to 12 weeks gestation at clinics in Kansas City, Columbia and St. Louis. 
“We put everything out there on negotiations, we were willing to do everything,” said state Sen. Maggie Nurrenbern, a Kansas City Democrat. “It came down to making sure that we were being honest with voters when it came to amendments that were being placed on the ballot. And to us, it is non negotiable to lie to voters.”
In the end, Republican leadership decided to deploy the PQ and force a vote. 
O’Laughlin defended the move in a post on social media, declaring that while she respects her colleagues on both sides of the aisle and is willing to “work endlessly” to reach compromise, “sometimes it simply is not something we can achieve.”
“Those who support conservative measures and vote us into office expect us to stand our ground on issues which reflect their bedrock beliefs,” she said. “That is what we did and I am proud of all my colleagues for taking a stand for what we consider right.”
Democrats contend Republican leadership was not interested in finding a compromise.
“Republicans did not step up and provide leadership,” said state Sen. Stephen Webber, a Columbia Democrat. 
The governor vowed Tuesday to call the General Assembly back into session later this year if the stadium funding plan didn’t pass. Missouri is competing to keep the teams with Kansas, which last year expanded a tax incentive program in the hopes of convincing one or both teams to relocate. 
The leases for both teams’ Jackson County stadiums run through the end of the 2030 season.
Senators have also floated the idea of a special session to consider a $500 million construction package the House refused to pass that would have funded projects for health care, education and law enforcement across the state.
“You could possibly have a special session,” said state Sen. Nick Schroer, a Defiance Republican. “But what’s that going to look like? I hope my colleagues on both sides can continue moving forward. We showed that we could work together on the majority of these issues this year, both sides making concessions, and that’s how it should be. Unfortunately we hit a brick wall, but I’m hoping for the best once we do come back, whether it’s in a special or in January.”
But on Wednesday, as the legislative session was collapsing under the weight of the Senate PQ, Democrats promised a much more confrontational approach.
“Moving forward, we’re going to operate with an assumption that Republicans don’t respect their fellow senators, they don’t respect the voters, they don’t respect the process and they don’t respect the institution,” Webber said. “We didn’t pick this fight, but we’re not scared.”

Michele Rayner is not certain how the budget impasse between the Florida House and Senate will end, but fears the result may not be good for most of her constituents.
“I really think that it’s going to come down to be a compromise, right? And my concern is that compromise is going to be on the back of everyday Floridians,” Rayner said Wednesday night in a virtual town hall meeting.
  Screenshot of Tampa Bay Area Democratic Rep. Michele Rayner during virtual town hall meeting on May 14, 2025.
“My concern is that the compromise is going to affect the people that I serve in District 62, or the people that Rep. [Lindsay] Cross serves, or the people that may not make a certain amount of money — all this kind of thing. So what I really foresee happening is that it is going to end, but the people of the state of Florida are going to take a hit that they unnecessarily don’t need.”
Fellow Pinellas Democratic Rep. Lindsay Cross joined Rayner in a Zoom meeting sponsored by Justice Over Everything, a social justice group co-founded by Rep. Rayner.
At the center of the budget breakdown is the size and dimensions of a tax cut for Floridians. House Speaker Daniel Perez’ signature plan had been a reduction in the state’s 6% sales tax, but that blew up last week after Gov. Ron DeSantis said he would veto any such cut, indicating it would interfere with his own plan to give homeowners a break on their property taxes in the form of $1,000 rebate checks.
Perez, however, blasted that proposal earlier this week, saying, “These checks do not actually lower property rates.”
Rayner sits on the 37-member Select Committee on Property Taxes created by the speaker to evaluate the possibility of overhauling local property taxes, which are the primary funding source for most local governments in the state.
As a progressive Democrat, DeSantis might have included her when he criticized the panel as a “dog and pony show” featuring “some of the most left-wing Democrats in the state of Florida.”

Cross, who represents much of St. Petersburg and Pinellas Park in the Florida House, said she is concerned about the status of appropriations filed by lawmakers this year as the budget talks eventually resume.
“I expect that there will be less money for member projects and appropriations that way, although we haven’t seen the draft of that,” she said.
“But I think that some of our nonprofits and community groups like the arts have already gotten hit by that massive veto last year. We had 35 arts and culture institutions in Pinellas County that lost funding because of that blanket veto last year, so I think some of those groups are going to have a harder time getting some of that funding, which may be the difference of those organizations being able to keep their doors open or not.”
Environment, LGBTQ
With the tax cut issue pushing the legislative session into overtime, there has been less discussion about what the Legislature actually did in terms of policy this year.
Equality Florida said in a press release that only four anti-LGBTQ bills were filed this year, and celebrated the fact that all four failed. Rayner said some of those bills are likely to come back next year, but she attributed their lack of movement to House leadership.
“We have a speaker that wasn’t into that,” she said, referring to Perez. “He’s very much a conservative. Very much a hard-line conservative, but he’s more low key. He’d probably get mad if I say this, but I don’t care. He’s more of a socially ‘liberalesque’ of his party vs. him being very fiscally conservative. That’s what you’ve seen him really, really focus on, vs. the last two terms I was in. We had speakers who were very, very socially conservative ideologues.”
Rep. Cross, who works as an environmental scientist, said two of the biggest wins as far as she is concerned regarded the environment: a measure (HB 209) to prevent development in state parks, and a bill (HB 1143) that bans oil exploration and drilling near the Apalachicola River in Northwest Florida.
“Both of those things happened, I think, because everyday Floridians and people who love this state got up in arms when they saw egregious proposals to either put pickleball courts, golf courses, hotels in our state parks, or drill for oil in Apalachicola, which is one of our most significant estuaries not only for its ecological value but also for its role in aquaculture and the oyster industry, which is very steeped in history and just the identity of that local area,” she said.
“So, both of those issues received attention from Republican lawmakers. The oil drilling bill was a bipartisan effort to prevent that. So for me, it shows that advocacy works in certain areas.”

It results from careful planning, strategic investment and a commitment to long-term growth. 
This approach applies not only to business but also to our most important resource: our children. The future of our state’s economy depends on how well we invest in our youngest citizens, and no investment is more impactful than early childhood education.
When families can access reliable, high-quality early education for their children, parents can go to work or school, and businesses thrive with a stable workforce. Most importantly, children enter kindergarten ready to succeed and better prepared to become the skilled workers and leaders of the future that our economy depends on.
In pro-family, pro-business states like ours, quality child care should be a cornerstone of family stability, worker productivity, and economic growth. Yet in Louisiana, despite years of progress and bipartisan support for early learning, we still fund this essential system as if it’s optional.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Nearly 174,000 children under age 5 in Louisiana are in households experiencing economic hardship, yet only one in five have access to high-quality early childhood education. 
Programs like Head Start, LA 4, and the Child Care Assistance Program (CCAP) are funded through federal and state funds and serve thousands of children, yet the demand still outpaces the supply. While the majority of funding for Louisiana’s child care programs comes from the federal government, state lawmakers ultimately decide how those dollars are used — and how much more we invest. 
The quality of our current and future workforce shouldn’t be left solely to decisions made in Washington.
Despite investments from all levels of government, more than 116,00 economically disadvantaged Louisiana children, from birth to age 4, still lack access to a high-quality, affordable child care program. Any changes in state and federal funding streams directly and immediately impact our working families, who need access to quality child care the most.
Due to inadequate funding, many families are left without affordable, high-quality child care options, leaving our children and their working parents behind. Whether we act or not, Louisiana’s future workforce is growing up right now. When we make it possible for children to access early learning programs, the data is clear: they are more likely to graduate from high school, secure well-paying jobs, and contribute to their communities. 
Failure to act leads to costly outcomes for our future communities and economy. But the gap in funding and access isn’t just a future problem — it impacts all of us today. 
Louisiana currently loses an estimated $1.3 billion annually in lost productivity, tax revenue and turnover costs due to inadequate access to child care. Yet, studies show that every dollar invested in early education returns at least 13% due to higher earnings, reduced social and academic remedial costs, and better long-term health outcomes.
It’s time for Louisiana to treat early childhood education not as an option but as an essential investment in our present and future. This legislative session, Louisiana lawmakers have the opportunity — and the obligation — to sustain and grow investments in early childhood education. 
Our children deserve a strong start. Our parents deserve the ability to work. And our state deserves a workforce ready to compete.

A celebration of Fred’s life will be scheduled in the summer.A Life Well LivedIt is with great sorrow that we announce the passing of Fred A. Curran, 80, who died peacefully at the Residence at Quarry Hill in South Burlington, VT on May 9, 2025.Fred was the beloved and loving husband of Ann (Bissonette) Curran, who died in December of 2022. Theirs was a joy-filled marriage of 52 years and a wellspring of peace and comfort for Fred to the end of his days. In his waning weeks, he often expressed his pleasure at the prospect of being reunited with Ann.Fred met Ann when they were both college students in Rochester, NY, he at St. John Fisher College, she at Nazareth College. After Fred received his graduate degree from Boston College, he and Ann married in 1970 and found their true forever home in Burlington.Fred was hired by UVM right out of grad school and became a highly regarded administrator, serving as Director of Institutional Research for more than thirty years, including a period as Assistant Provost. It was said that any statistic one could want about UVM (or the entire American educational system) could be found at Fred’s fingertips.He held leadership positions on state and regional higher education boards and commissions. Following his retirement, he served on the executive board of UVM’s Retired Faculty and Administrative Officer organization.He was a man of many interests, ranging from an encyclopedic knowledge of the First World War, to mystery novels, cooking, travel and long walks all over Burlington. His life-long love of gadgetry meant that if there was a new piece of electronic equipment you’d just heard about, chances were that Fred already had it.He and Ann shared a love of birding and traveled the U.S., Canada, Europe and even Sri Lanka in pursuit of species both domestic and exotic. And you could be sure that Fred would be the birder with the latest, most sophisticated binoculars (not to mention the field jacket with the most pockets).He and Ann subscribed to the Opera de Montreal and traveled there often, though it could be said that the city’s many gourmet international restaurants were an added draw for Fred.  His love of good food, great wines and well-made cocktails (especially Perfect Manhattans) was legendary.He was a great booster of UVM athletics, especially men’s basketball and hockey. He and Ann were courtside regulars at Catamounts games and at the Frozen Four playoffs.If a man’s life may be measured, at least in part, by how he made those around him feel, then Fred’s life must be judged a great success. His innate warmth and sociability made him a pleasure to be with. Even when faced with his own health challenges, he found the humor in life’s little ironies. He was a much-loved figure at Quarry Hill and was famous for welcoming newcomers and helping them get settled.Fred’s family would like to thank his many friends, most of whom had been a part of his life for decades, for their unending love and support. Thanks also go out to his devoted caregivers, to the staff, nurses and administrators at the Residence at Quarry Hill and to the many caring people at Bayada hospice.Fred was predeceased by his mother Alma Ulber Indivino, his father Arthur Curran, his stepfather Tracy Indivino and uncles Alfred and Robert Ulber and Maurius and Albert Centoz. He is survived by his brother-in-law Paul Bissonette and wife Barbara Silvestri, his niece Maya Bissonette and husband David Tamburin, his nephew Bohdan Bissonette and wife Melissa and daughter Josie, his aunt Bonnie Ulber and by his cousins in New York, California and Arizona.In Fred’s memory, donations are encouraged in his name to Habitat for Humanity or HomeShare of Vermont.A celebration of Fred’s life will be scheduled in the summer.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Fred A.

(Courtesy Special Collections, USDA National Agricultural Library).Members of New Mexico’s federal delegation on Thursday responded to growing concerns about the spread of the New World Screwworm, a parasitic fly that can damage livestock and other animals.
United States Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins on May 11 announced the immediate suspension of live cattle, horse and bison imports through United States ports of entry along the southern border “due to the continued and rapid northward spread” of NWS in Mexico. According to the USDA, NWS “has been recently detected in remote farms with minimal cattle movement as far north as Oaxaca and Veracruz, about 700 miles away from the U.S. border.”
U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), a member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, announced on Thursday bipartisan legislation, also sponsored by fellow New Mexico Democrat U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich, aimed at curbing the outbreak. The Strengthening Tactics to Obstruct the Population of Screwworms (STOP Screwworms) Act, introduced by Republican U.S. Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, would pay for and direct the USDA to start construction on a new sterile fly production facility.
“Given the current screwworm outbreak, Congress must take immediate action to help protect New Mexico’s cattle and livestock from this growing threat,” Luján said in a statement. “This bipartisan legislation will fund a new sterile fly facility to help stop the spread of the destructive New World screwworm and protect New Mexico’s 1.4 million cattle and calves. This is a critical investment that supports over 10,000 cattle farms and ranches in New Mexico, saves the U.S. livestock industry nearly $1 billion each year, and helps prevent an outbreak in the U.S.”
U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez (D-N.M.) who represents the state’s 2nd congressional district that includes the border communities, wrote to USDA Secretary Rollins in March expressing concerns about the mounting NWS threat, and is a co-sponsor of the new legislation in his chamber.
“I’ve been raising the alarm about the New World Screwworm threat because I know what it means for our ranchers, ports, and rural economies,” Vasquez said in a statement this week. “That’s why I introduced this bipartisan bill to fight this outbreak and protect our livestock industry. I was one of the first lawmakers to urge the USDA to take this seriously. Livestock auctions in New Mexico are already feeling the squeeze, and ranchers who depend on cross-border cattle trade are being left in limbo. USDA must be transparent about the timeline for reopening ports of entry, and they need to address the staffing and operational issues that are slowing things down. Our border economies can’t wait.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/screwworm.jpg,,,2025-05-15 11:15:07.617817

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota’s state government is testing for “forever chemicals” in rivers across the state.
Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have been used in industry and consumer products since the 1940s, including in modern products such as nonstick cookware and water-resistant clothing, and don’t break down easily in the environment or in the human body. Research indicates PFAS exposure may be linked to negative developmental and reproductive effects, and an increased risk of some cancers.
Concerns about their prevalence in the environment and their impacts on human health have grown steadily in recent years, as they’ve been discovered in drinking water, fish and food packaging.
State offering free PFAS cleanup to local fire departments, schools

The Biden administration set first-ever limits on the chemicals in last year. EPA-mandated testing has found them in nearly half of Americans’ drinking water. Publicly available test results found a type of PFAS called perfluorooctane sulfonic acid at Mount Rushmore National Memorial as well as smaller amounts of other PFAS contaminants in Aberdeen, Harrisburg, Rapid Valley Sanitary District, Lincoln County Rural Water System and the Mni Wiconi water system. The Trump administration is planning to weaken drinking water limits on PFAS, according to Politico.
The state Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources began testing rivers this spring to “establish a baseline” for the presence of PFAS in surface waters across the state, according to Ben Koisti, spokesman for the department.
The department will use results to determine risks and help “identify and address potential contaminant sources,” Koisti said in an emailed statement.

“The results can also be beneficial for water systems that use surface water as their water source,” Koisti said. “If PFAS contamination is identified in an area and at concentrations that pose a potential risk to a drinking water system, DANR will take action to further identify the source and mitigate the contamination to protect the impacted water supply.”
Testing is underway with additional sampling planned at the 30 testing sites this fall. Results will be posted on the department’s website. The East Dakota Water Development District tested 11 sites along the Big Sioux River in eastern South Dakota last year, finding the contaminants were most concentrated downstream of cities like Watertown and Sioux Falls in its preliminary data.
The department’s sampling sites were selected based on geographic distribution, population density, and whether the surface water contributes to a drinking water supply. There are 26 water systems in the state that rely on surface water for drinking water.
The project costs about $15,000 using federal EPA funds through the Public Water System Supervision grant.

Titled “Justice Delayed Is Still Justice Denied,” the event allowed participants to share comments, calls for justice, and frustration over the 2022 death of Black motorist Patrick Lyoya by white former Grand Rapids Police officer Christopher Schurr.
During community testimonies and opinions, citizens and community leaders from Grand Rapids expressed their discontent with what they say is ongoing police abuse and frustration over last week´s mistrial in the Schurr case and their demand for a retrial.
Schurr was charged with second-degree murder in the shooting of Lyoya, a 26-year-old Congolese refugee, in the back of his head during a traffic stop on April 4, 2022. 
The trial concluded May 8 without a jury decision after Kent County Circuit Judge Christina Mins declared a mistrial which sparked collective outrage in the community.

The listening session began with speeches from leaders of the organizations involved in this event, attorneys, and social activists.
¨This system is inherently evil because when you have the audacity to draw your side arm and shoot a young man who is 26 years old who poses no threat to you in the back of his head, that’s evil and not justifiable,¨ NAACP President Cle Jackson said.
¨We will continue the fight that has been for decades around accountability within the Grand Rapids police system,” Eric Brown, Urban League of West Michigan president said during his virtual speech.
¨We will not rest until we get to make sure that police are going to be held accountable for their misbehaviour. They are not above the law,¨ Brown remarked.
Among the speakers, civil attorney Steven Drew provided legal police contexts to the public and answered community questions.
”This is nothing new. I even learned that suing the police is a difficult thing, because the police are called the blue code, always coming and trying to help each other among them,” Drew emphasized.

Drew also mentioned that during Schurr’s trial, the defense requested a mistrial several times, and the jury denied those requests. However, the mistrial occurred anyway because the jury couldn’t reach a unanimous verdict. He clarified that in criminal cases, all twelve jurors must agree on a verdict; otherwise, they must declare a mistrial, as has happened.
Fridah Kay, founder of A Glimpse of Africa and an African immigrant, emotionally emphasized the suffering of Lyoya’s family and the problems faced by immigrants and refugees.
”It is very hard, especially for me as an immigrant and my refugee community. We have so many competing needs, and then to just imagine, you have to keep up finding a system that is not giving you a chance,” Kay said to those gathered for the event. ”I spoke to Patrick´s dad, and he is exhausted. He is tired. He is really not trying to do this, but this is what we have. This is all we can do.”

During public commentary and testimony, reported instances of police abuse and brutality did not take long to come up over the microphone. Concerns over jury selection were also expressed among the audience. 
Lamar Fourcha, 35, a Grand Rapids resident, recounted how he was brutally pulled from his car and thrown to the ground by more than five police officers the night of April 5, 2024, outside his home, as he was returning from work. 
Fourcha said his wife was also arrested as she watched them handcuff her husband on the road. Although Fourcha said he was cleared of all charges filed against him by the police, he lost his job and his home, and is undergoing therapy as a result of the police abuse. He still sees the same officers that he contends violently arrested him.
”There needs to be some type of accountability on the GR police department, because I see these same officers that assaulted me during the night, on third shift. I see them on TV shows. I see them still going as if everything is okay,” said Fourcha.
Outrage over the impunity enjoyed by police in the abuse of Black and brown people was a recurring theme brought up by those in attendance. 
“I am not going to turn the other cheek. It is time to keep fighting. They think we are weak. They don’t know us. You don’t know us. Don’t be afraid, and let’s show them something different,” Jocelyn Robinson, 76, and a Grand Rapids resident, said.

(Photo: Richard Bednarski/Nevada Current)“Nevada’s economy is already suffering from the chaos caused by President Trump’s trade wars, which have blown a $350 million hole in our state budget,” Nevada Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro and Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager said in a joint statement this week.
“Congressional Republicans’ new plan to cut federal SNAP funding will cost Nevada another $50 million every year, shifting that cost onto Nevada taxpayers. And while we don’t yet know the full state budget impact of the GOP’s proposed Medicaid cuts, it is clear that low-income Nevadans will lose their coverage and our uninsured rate will rise,” added the Democratic legislative leaders.
So with Washington piling so many additional costly burdens on the state, and given both the scale and duration of the chaos created by Trump’s helter-skelter economy remain unknown, the only prudent thing for Nevada Democratic legislators to do is … give $120 million of public funds to California motion picture corporations every year for 15 years? 
That was not the course of action recommended by Cannizzaro and Yeager. Well, not in their joint statement this week, anyway. 
Instead, they said that Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo should “join the 23 other governors who have already spoken out against these cuts before a bill is passed and the damage to Nevada is done.”
Fair enough. But Cannizzaro and Yeager already made Lombardo say “Medicaid” once this year. Shockingly (to no one anywhere), Trump and congressional Republicans appear not to have noticed the governor of Nevada having an opinion on something, and are storming ahead to deprive people of vital safety net programs — while leaving states to pick up the slack — Lombardo’s concerns notwithstanding.
Meanwhile, a panel of Yeager’s Democratic Assembly colleagues indicated during a hearing last week that a.critical mass of Democratic legislators will be steaming ahead with the largest public subsidy to private industry in Nevada history (and that is not a low bar) by authorizing $1.8 billion worth of transferable tax credits for Hollywood film corporations.
Even the one (and only) existing analysis of the proposal’s economic impact, an analysis built at the film industry’s request and based on numbers provided by the industry, predicts roughly half the total jobs that might be created via film tax credits would be in hotels, retail, and food service.
Those are already the state’s three largest occupational sectors. With exceptions, most notably Culinary union members working under collectively bargained contracts, jobs in those sectors are often held by people in households who rely on Medicaid and other programs that Trump and his congressional lapdogs are about to slice and dice.
In other words, an enormous film tax credit bill will almost certainly generate even more Nevada workers who will need Medicaid, while at the same time deprive the state of $120 million in annual tax revenue the state will need to compensate for Trump’s Medicaid and SNAP funding cuts.




How transferable tax credits cost the state money: A $50 million example
Transferable tax credits sell for less than face value — a discount of about 10% isn’t unusual.
Let’s say the state issues Sony $50 million of tax credits. MGM Resorts International buys them from Sony for $45 million. Then, instead of paying the state $50 million in gaming taxes that it owes, MGM gives the state the tax credits it bought from Sony.
MGM gets a $5 million tax break.
Sony gets $45 million.
And the state, which otherwise would have received $50 million in tax revenue from MGM, gets nothing.




The tax credit bill’s sponsors, Democratic Assemblymembers Danielle Monroe-Moreno (who is also chair of the Nevada Democratic Party; this thing has always been a Democratic brainchild) and Sandra Jauregi, said don’t worry be happy at last week’s hearing, because:

The film industry won’t get any public assistance until 2028, so the bill wouldn’t compound the aforementioned “$350 million hole in our state budget,” and
“Additional guardrails,” as Jauregi dubbed them — as yet unidentified — will be in place in case the economy is still being tortured by Trump’s tantrums in 2028.

Here’s an idea for a guardrail: Put the Godzilla of Giveaways on ice. If everyone insists on continuing to consider it, get some independent economic analysis that critically takes into account the performance of film tax credits elsewhere, and present some verifiably concrete reasons to move ahead other than the fact that Howard Hughes Holdings thinks it would be cool.
Lombardo(!?) has a better idea
Weighing in at $12 million a year — one-tenth the size of the film tax credits giveaway — the governor is proposing a plan to use transferable tax credits for new and expanding child care facilities.
Here’s the difference between more child care and more film industry: If Nevada never has  more of a local film industry than it already has (the economic impact of which after all is mostly more of the same), that’s not going to be a drag on the economy we have now. But chronic unaffordable and/or unavailable child care continues to be a drag on Nevada’s economy every day in countless ways, and it has been for years.
Child care allows parents to work. And that means child care is good for the parents’ employers, i.e., business. 
Quality affordable child care also helps assure the well-being of the child, not only through the day-to-day care itself, but by buttressing household financial stability — the most important factor in a child’s educational performance and success, according to mountains of research. 
Unlike sports fields and film studios and tax breaks for any and every company that bats its eyes at the state, promoting and assisting quality child care is genuine economic development, saving money for families, the community, and the state. Over the long-term, child care is one of the soundest investments a society can make.
Lombardo’s tax credit proposal, which is included in an otherwise unremarkable economic development bill, would provide transferable tax credits to help finance a new or expanding child care facility for up to five years. True, $12 million a year is not, well, $120 million a year, and it’s hard to say how much of a dent the program could make in the state’s child care shortage.
But even small progress on the child care front — especially on a bang-for-buck basis — would be at least ten times more beneficial to Nevada families than ladling public money to Sony Pictures and Warner Bros.
As this is written, roughly 20 days before the Legislature is scheduled to adjourn for a year and a half, the legislation including the child care tax credits isn’t even scheduled for a hearing.
Things appear to be going swimmingly for Sony and Warner Bros. though.
Cannizzaro and Yeager, like every elected Democrat in the country, need to call out Trump and congressional Republicans. Of course they do.
At the same time, Nevada’s Democratic legislative leaders, and those who advise them, also need to carefully and thoughtfully tend to what’s going on in their own back yard. There’s more than one school of thought that says state and local Democratic failure to do that is why Trump won.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/canniyeager-1024x668.jpg,,,2025-05-15 11:15:07.617817

Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/ Virginia MercuryNext summer, certain people with past convictions will be eligible to apply for their criminal records to be sealed — meaning long-past convictions won’t show up on background checks. 
This can help people who have been formerly incarcerated and rehabilitated get a fresh start when applying for jobs, loans or apartments. The process stems from a 2021 law that underwent several years of workshopping before its delayed implementation.
Starting next summer, people with some misdemeanor and felony convictions will be able to petition to have their records sealed. For felonies, people need to have had no new convictions for 10 years to be eligible, while people with misdemeanor convictions need to have no new convictions in seven years. People with Class 1 or 2 felony convictions, typically violent crimes, or charges that carry life sentences are not eligible. And petitioners must not have been convicted of a Class 3 or Class 4 felony within 20 years. 
For people with misdemeanors that might have been dismissed but still appear on records, expungement of records is a separate process they can seek out through their local circuit courts. 
While expungement has been a limited option for people in Virginia, record-sealing is new. 
The 2021 law’s rollout has been slowed down to give circuit court clerks time to prepare for waves of people who would seek a sealing, determine how far back in court records would be permitted (prior to the 1980s, most courts weren’t digitized), and compromise on the types of crimes that are eligible. 
Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, virtually joined a panel of criminal justice experts Wednesday in Richmond to discuss the law’s evolution and the journey for beneficiaries that lies ahead. 
“It was important to get the system up and running and functioning,” Surovell said, noting that updates to Virginia’s digital criminal record-keeping that can help streamline the process have been underway in recent years. 
And while he, Del. Rae Cousins, D-Richmond, and Suffolk Circuit Court Clerk Randy Carter suspect the law will need further tweaking, they celebrated the fact that it’s come to fruition.
With a start date of July 1, 2026, Surovell said dozens of constituents have already reached out to him to express excitement. Surovell said that one of those people had a larceny charge in his youth that has “followed him around” for decades. 
Likewise, Cousins stressed her support for the law. 
“It is laws like this that make it easier for people who have taken accountability who have also served their time, who have rehabilitated themselves to actually get out and have a second chance at life.”
Lawyer George Townsend, who moderated the panel, said the law inspired him to found a firm called Clean Slate Virginia, specifically focused on record-sealing cases. 
He said he saw the law as a “game changer” for helping people get their lives back on track and reduce recidivism. 
With a little more than a year before the law is effective, the panel acknowledged that public outreach about the new law will help let potential petitioners know they have this option.

(Photo by Scott Heins/Getty Images)Following a request by the federal government, the state of Alaska has turned over the personal information of roughly 70,000 Alaskans enrolled in the federally funded Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps.
As first reported by NPR, the federal government normally collects information to determine a SNAP applicant’s financial eligibility for the program. The new request goes beyond that, to cover name, date of birth, address, contact information, Social Security number, citizenship status and information about people living in a recipient’s household. 
It affects nearly 1 in 10 Alaska residents, who participate in the program.
In a May 6 memo, the USDA said it was requesting that information because of an executive order by President Donald Trump. Numerous news agencies have reported that the Department of Government Efficiency — part of the executive branch under Trump — has used that order to combine personal data collected from several agencies to help the federal government track and arrest immigrants they want to remove from the country.
“Alaska is complying with the federal government’s requirement to share the information as requested,” said Alex Huseman, a public information officer for the Alaska Department of Health.
“Per the USDA guidance on May 6, 2025 … all data related to SNAP is being shared with the federal government,” he said. “This includes any information on a client’s application or renewal, any documentation sent in as part of their application or renewal, or other data acquired by DPA staff while processing applications and renewals.”
The USDA is specifically requesting “records sufficient to identify individuals as applicants for, or recipients of, SNAP benefits, including but not limited to personally identifiable information in the form of names, dates of birth, personal addresses used, and Social Security numbers.”
Huseman said the federal government has not requested that information before.
The Alaska Legislature has previously expressed concerns about the federal collection of Alaskans’ personal data but has not addressed the SNAP data-sharing arrangement.
In 2008, the Legislature forbade the state from spending money to implement the post-Sept. 11 REAL ID program, and only begrudgingly reversed course years later.
In 2017, lawmakers said they did not trust federal government data collection and requested additional privacy protections. Among those lawmakers was then-Sen. Mike Dunleavy, R-Wasilla.
“Federal contractors, businesses, everyone’s a victim here, of the federal government,” Dunleavy told the Anchorage Daily News about the REAL ID program.

The company informed regulators late last month that it overcharged another 20,000 customers an undisclosed amount.  
The Public Utilities Commission’s Regulatory Operations Staff is asking the PUC to launch an investigation to “address numerous residential rate misclassifications” by NV Energy.
“Commission investigation and action are necessary to provide transparency, ensure just outcomes for injured customers, and investigate whether NV Energy properly administered its tariffs in its attempt to remedy the situation to date,” PUC staff wrote in a petition posted to the agency’s website late Wednesday. 
PUC staff, through an investigation, “discovered that NV Energy has been overcharging tens of thousands of misclassified residential customers since as early as 2001. Between April 1, 2017,  and April 1, 2024, NV Energy’s residential rate misclassifications resulted in nearly 60,000 customers being overcharged in excess of $17 million,” the petition says. 
The utility, which says it completed an audit of the misclassifications in January, disclosed in late April that it overcharged some 20,000 “previously unidentified ‘multi-family accounts’ for an undisclosed amount.” 
“It remains unclear to Staff whether NV Energy will identify additional misclassified residential premises,” the petition reads. 
The utility said it is currently reviewing its nonresidential accounts to determine if any are misclassified, the petition says.
“Despite overcharging more than 80,000 customers for up to 23 years, NV Energy only provided refunds to a portion of affected customers. For the customers who received them, NV Energy capped refunds at six months, amounting to less than $2 million in refunds,” PUC staff asserted, adding the rule employed by the utility that “unarguably does not apply” to customers in the north, and is “otherwise inapplicable to this situation.” 
The skimpiness of the refunds triggered public outcry and caught the attention of the Legislature this year, the petition says. 
It’s unknown how the misclassification occurred, according to the petition, but it began in 2001 when the utility adopted its multi-family rate schedule. 
Between 2017 and 2024, NV Energy overcharged some 59,939 customers across 22,101 premises, just over $17 million because it misclassified the multifamily residences as single-family. 
During the same period, NV Energy undercharged 5,438 customers across 2,451 premises for just over $2.5 million because it misclassified single-family residences as multi-family. 
“In addition to financial harm, NV Energy disconnected service for a substantial number of injured customers due to nonpayment. Between April 1, 2017 and April 1, 2024, NV Energy disconnected service to 3,177 of the 59,939 customers who overpaid. 
The petition says it’s unknown whether the customers endured multiple disconnections or if the overcharging was a substantial reason for the lack of payment and subsequent disconnections. 
Staff writes that given the number of affected customers disconnected for nonpayment, “it is reasonable to infer that overbilling contributed to, if not caused, nonpayment and related service disconnections in some cases.” 
Staff contends NV Energy used an inapplicable rule to cap refunds at six months, “denying tens of thousands of known injured customers millions of dollars of measurable financial losses…” 
The utility did not notify PUC staff of the mistake, but instead unilaterally applied the six month rule. 
Staff learned of the misclassifications through customer complaints of insufficient refunds. The utility released a public statement saying it “promptly refunded the overcharged customers in accordance with the applicable rules and is not seeking repayment by those customers who were undercharged.” 
NV Energy did not publicly disclose that the amount undercharged was a fraction (12.4%) of the amount overcharged, according to PUC staff. 
The Commission can issue administrative fines against NV Energy, require the restoration of funding to accounts necessary to achieve compliance with proper rate schedules, and impose any other remedy available. 
Staff is recommending the Commission order NV Energy to fully refund affected customers as a sanction.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)A small, little-known provision is among the most contentious issues at the Capitol this session. It doesn’t have to do with health care for undocumented immigrants or cutting services for people with disabilities. It’s about your eye doctor.
Minnesota optometrists for years have sought the ability to prescribe oral antiviral medications — to treat ailments such as glaucoma — for up to 14 days and administer injections in and around the eye. Dozens of other states allow optometrists to administer these medications and perform injections, but Minnesota is an outlier.
Instead, Minnesotans have to see an ophthalmologist for that care. The state has fewer ophthalmologists — licensed physicians who went to medical school — than optometrists, who completed four years of graduate study but are doctors of optometry, not doctors of medicine. This means in order to receive the care, patients have to pay more, travel further and endure longer wait times.
This seemingly innocuous expansion of what’s known among policymakers as “scope of practice” may seem mundane, but it’s a microcosm of how influence works at the Capitol, and how that influence can net millions of dollars for legislative winners.
Ophthalmologists and optometrists are dug in: Ophthalmologists say the optometry scope of practice expansion would endanger Minnesotans, while optometrists point out the vast amount of money ophthalmologists have given to Democrats in hopes of winning influence and blocking the optometrists.
The optometrists were on the one-yard line last year when then-House Speaker Melissa Hortman pulled the provision even after House and Senate negotiators had signed off on a compromise.
With a 67-67 tied House, Hortman doesn’t have the same power this year. But the provision could still be killed by Gov. Tim Walz, who is close to a prominent ophthalmologist and DFL donor Mary Lawrence.
When asked if he supports a scope of practice expansion for optometrists at a recent press conference, Walz said he’ll rely on data and science. But he echoed language ophthalmologists have been using around the Capitol to lobby against the scope expansion:
“I think the safety of Minnesotans is the top priority,” Walz said.
Safety
Optometrists want to be able to do injections around the eye — especially anesthesia — to treat styes or inject medicine for various diseases or swelling. Optometry schools train students how to do these injections in order to receive their Doctor of Optometry degree.
Ophthalmologists argue that because optometrists don’t have an M.D., they aren’t trained to deal with injections and potential complications.
“The legislation would allow optometrists to do surgical procedures. Optometrists are essential parts of the health care team, and we do all work together but optometrists — they are doctors of optometry. They are not doctors of medicine, and they are not surgeons, and the bill would allow them to do procedures that they just aren’t able to do and are not taught to do appropriately,” said Dr. Amanda Maltry, a board-certified ophthalmologist and president of the Minnesota Academy of Eye Physicians and Surgeons.
Maltry said that injections around the eye are essentially surgery because the organ is tiny and delicate. Instead of a scalpel to do her procedures, Maltry said, she uses needles. 
“When I think of the eye, I think in millimeters because the spaces that we’re working in are so tiny,” Maltry said.
Optometrists say they aren’t asking to do surgery. They’re seeking to do in-office procedures — nothing like the kind of surgery for cataracts or glaucoma performed in an operating room, said Beth Coleman-Jensen, executive director of the Minnesota Optometric Association.
“We want to help patients, and if the scope does not evolve with the care that optometrists are being trained and taught and is available, then the patients are hindered from that care and it’s an access issue,” Coleman-Jensen said.
The Minnesota Board of Optometry — the state’s regulatory board that licenses optometrists — for the first time last year got involved in the years-long scope of practice battle.
In written testimony, it said that Minnesota eye care is lagging behind —  especially compared to neighboring states where optometrists are able to offer more services.
But the board also pointedly raised what’s been understood but unspoken: Some ophthalmologists are throwing big campaign money at the issue.
“It is troublesome that the opposition to these bills comes from a small delegation of individuals who do not accurately represent the professions at large or consider the patients a priority. It is further troubling when reviewing donation logs and corresponding votes or simply certain legislators being unwilling to hear a bill due to support that they have received from a very small delegation of individuals,” the board wrote.
The largest donor is Dr. Mary Lawrence, a retired ophthalmologist who, along with her husband Jim Lawrence, are prominent DFL donors and longtime opponents of allowing optometrists to broaden their care. Mary Lawrence is also on the board of the Minnesota Academy of Eye Physicians and Surgeons.
From 2016 to 2023, the Lawrences donated nearly $750,000 to the House DFL and Senate DFL caucuses, the Alliance for a Better Minnesota and individual Democratic legislators.
In 2018, Jim Lawrence gave $60,000 to the Minnesota Victory Fund, a pro-Walz political action committee that was instrumental in assisting Walz’s 2018 campaign after he lost the DFL endorsement.
Last year, Mary Lawrence gave $50,000 to the House DFL Caucus and boasted in a blog post for the Minnesota Medical Association about her connections with legislative leaders.
“Over the past several years, my husband, Jim, and I have hosted dozens of political fundraisers … Together, Jim and I have developed personal relationships with legislative leaders in Minnesota, and as a result, we hope that ‘excellent physician-led health care’ is at the forefront of legislative decision making,” she wrote.
A message left with Mary Lawrence was not immediately returned.
Scope of practice battles often put lawmakers in an uncomfortable position. Each year, multiple professions ask legislators to dictate into law what they can and cannot do, even though lawmakers usually have little or no experience in the field.
Scope battles aren’t normally contentious. Last year, the Legislature signed into law scope of practice changes to multiple professions, including veterinary technicians, dental assistants and social workers.
But the optometry versus ophthalmologist battle has been ongoing for years.
Rep. Robert Bierman, DFL-Apple Valley, has chief authored the optometry bill for seven years straight and has been working with the two professions to come to a compromise.
“Scope of practice is really important to do so that we keep all of our professionals working up to their scope. If they’re not, then we’re not using our professionals to the maximum level,” said Bierman, who also serves as co-chair of the House Health Policy and Finance Committee. “With optometry, we are woefully behind.”
Maltry, the president of the state ophthalmologist association, said there’s a better way to expand the scope of practice for optometrists and encourages lawmakers to write legislation that has “patient safety guard rails.”
Optometrists are optimistic that they will finally be able to offer more services for their patients this year.
But if last year was any hint, many are prepared for a last-minute loss.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NN250425_1005-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-05-15 10:09:45.287800

(Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)The Colorado Legislature passed dozens of bills making changes to K-12 education in the state this year. 
Some bills add new requirements for school districts and their policies while others relate to curriculum requirements for students. Lawmakers also approved a new school finance policy that extends the implementation of a new school finance formula approved last year amid budget shortfalls. 
Colorado Gov. Jared Polis has signed a few education measures from the legislative session into law already while several others await his signature. The 2025 session ended last week.
Here are some other bills that came from the Legislature’s work on education.

Financial literacy
House Bill 25-1192 requires that school districts implement a financial literacy course as a graduation requirement for high school students. 
Public high school students would need to pass a financial literacy class in their junior or senior year under the requirements of the bill. Colorado law currently encourages school districts to require financial literacy coursework for graduation, and about one-quarter of districts do so, according to the Colorado Department of Education.
The bipartisan measure would apply starting with students who are in the ninth grade starting in September 2026.
The class would need to cover the standards adopted by the State Board of Education in 2022, which include topics like household budgeting, saving, investing, using credit, and understanding the difference between leasing and buying large purchases like cars and homes.
The bill would also make completion of the federal or state financial aid form a condition for graduation. Students and parents would be able to opt out of that requirement. 
Polis has not yet taken action on the bill.
Black education standards
House BIll 25-1149 directs the Colorado Department of Education to establish a 17-member advisory committee to help develop statewide K-12 curriculum on Black history and cultural studies. 
The curriculum should represent “Black historical experiences through truthful, inclusive, complex narratives that connect with contemporary realities” and highlight “innovations and cultural contributions of Black people in Colorado, America, and the world,” the bill says.










Implementing a standardized Black history curriculum in our public schools ensures that students of all races and backgrounds receive a more complete education that prepares them to be informed, engaged citizens and honors the extensive contributions of Black Americans in shaping our state and nation.


– Sen. Tony Exum


The Trump administration has targeted DEI — diversity, equity and inclusion — initiatives particularly in educational institutions.  
“Implementing a standardized Black history curriculum in our public schools ensures that students of all races and backgrounds receive a more complete education that prepares them to be informed, engaged citizens and honors the extensive contributions of Black Americans in shaping our state and nation,” Sen. Tony Exum, a Colorado Springs Democrat who sponsored the bill, said in a statement celebrating its passage. 
The advisory committee will include experts on Black history and culture, teachers from rural and urban school districts, a librarian, curriculum specialists, community leaders, a parent in a public school parent organization and members of the Colorado Legislature, among others. 
The timeline for implementing the new standards aligns with the six-year cycle the State Board of Education already uses for revising academic standards. Education providers will have two years to implement the standards after they are developed.
Polis has not yet taken action on the bill.
Cell phone use in schools
House Bill 25-1135 requires school districts to adopt policies on the use of cell phones and other communication devices during the school day.
The bipartisan bill does not impose a ban on student cell phone use but intends to reduce classroom distractions and requires all Colorado schools, including charter schools, to adopt their own policies by July 2026. 
“Many teachers already work hard to limit phone use in class, but they need backup,” Sen. Janice Marchman, a Loveland Democrat who sponsored the bill, said in a statement. “This new law gives local schools the support to set clear, consistent policies — so students can focus, learn, and take a real break from the pressures of constant connectivity.”
The policies must also consider accommodations for students who need access to a phone for medical reasons. 
A 2023 advisory from the U.S. Surgeon General warns that social media use among young people is associated with poor mental health, especially among adolescent girls. Research also shows that cell phone use during instruction time has adverse effects on student learning.
Polis signed the bill into law at the start of May. 
Library book ban policies
Senate Bill 25-63, dubbed the Freedom to Read Act, requires school districts to create policies about the “acquisition, retention, display, reconsideration, and use” of library books and other materials by September. 
The measure intends to safeguard public school libraries from the growing trend that targets certain books, often about diverse topics or by diverse authors, for removal.
“This legislation creates a standard process to evaluate a book’s inclusion or removal from a library, further shielding our public school libraries from D.C. culture wars and political fights,” Rep. Jenny Willford, a Northglenn Democrat who sponsored the bill, said in a statement. “Schools are for learning, and our students deserve access to age-appropriate books that encourage them to think broadly and critically about the world.” 
District policies will need to consider when and why library materials can be removed, and outline a process for challenging and removing books from circulation. Only parents of students in the school district will be allowed to challenge books, and reviews of individual books will be limited to once every two years.
In 2024, there were seven attempts to ban 137 books in public schools and libraries in Colorado, according to the American Library Association. The most challenged book in the country that year was “All Boys Aren’t Blue,” a memoir written for young adults by queer Black author George Johnson.

(Dave Kendall)TOPEKA — The Trump administration is attempting to strike protections for the lesser prairie chicken, a bird that has teetered between threatened and endangered for decades.
The administration argued in a May 7 court filing that a Biden-era ruling granting protections for the lesser prairie chicken contained mistakes when the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service identified two distinct populations of the bird.
The filing alleges the USFWS improperly applied policy when determining whether the lesser prairie chicken should be listed under the Endangered Species Act, which “amounts to a serious substantive defect because it calls into question the very foundation of the listing decision.”
The lesser prairie chicken forages on the grasslands and brush of southeastern Colorado, southwestern Kansas, eastern New Mexico, western Oklahoma and the panhandle and south plains of Texas. Those lands are also viewed as prime cattle-grazing and oil and gas drilling areas.
In the bird’s southern range in New Mexico and the southwest Texas Panhandle, it is listed as endangered. In it’s northern range of Kansas, Oklahoma and the northeast Texas panhandle, it’s threatened, a lesser listing but still affording some protections. Experts and politicians have argued that the lesser prairie chicken serves as an indicator species, signaling the health of grasslands and prairies.
In 2023, then-President Joe Biden vetoed legislation from Kansas Republican U.S. Sens. Roger Marshall and Jerry Moran that would reverse its status as a threatened species. Again in 2025, U.S. Rep. Tracey Mann and Marshall introduced legislation in each chamber to delist the lesser prairie chicken and prevent any future efforts to relist the species. Neither bill has progressed.
The Center for Biological Diversity, which has been advocating for protections for 30 years, said the lesser prairie chicken has been left in jeopardy. The center renewed an attempt to intervene in the case and opposed the Trump administration’s move.
“The Trump administration is again capitulating to the fossil fuel industry, ignoring sound science and common sense, and dooming an imperiled species to extinction,” said Jason Rylander, legal director at the center’s Climate Law Institute.
The Endangered Species Act, passed and enacted in 1973, restricts certain uses, including drilling and ranching, on lands that are habitats to endangered or threatened species. The Trump administration’s court filing argued that the lesser prairie chicken’s habitat is adequately protected without the listing. It is served by “at least sixteen different conservation efforts and programs administered by state, federal, and private entities,” the filing said.
Rylander said there’s “no question” the lesser prairie chicken is imperiled.
“Removing Endangered Species Act protections is a purely political act that won’t stand up in court,” he said. “We won’t let this administration drive species to extinction so fossil fuel billionaires and their shareholders can make a buck.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/DSC07039-1024x582.jpeg,,,2025-05-15 09:03:16.714927

When Gov. Gavin Newsom released his preliminary $322 billion state budget plan in January, he projected a “modest surplus.” But many things have changed since then: A general economic slowdown in the U.S. economy; an estimated decline in income tax revenue due to the stock market fallout from President Donald Trump’s tariffs; and an unprecedented Medi-Cal budget shortfall to name a few.
Now — as Newsom on Wednesday unveiled his updated budget plan — California is facing a $12 billion budget deficit, writes CalMatters’ Alexei Koseff. 
Newsom’s budget proposal paints an economic outlook that, at best, is unclear, and at worst, is grim. For instance, Trump’s ongoing tariff policies (which Newsom described in the plan as “remarkably inconsistent”) could have “broad-reaching impacts” on nearly all of the state’s imports and could worsen inflation in California. The state’s job growth is also expected to slow through 2026.
In light of the current and upcoming challenges, Newsom plans to close the gap in a few ways. He still needs legislative approval.

Walking back Medi-Cal: To save more than $5 billion, Newsom wants to pause new Medi-Cal enrollments for adult immigrants without legal status beginning in 2026 — a rollback Republican legislators have called for. He is also proposing that adults with “certain statuses” (which could still include those with lawful status) pay a $100 monthly premium starting in 2027. Weight loss drugs, such as Ozempic, would no longer be covered as well, which is estimated to save $85 million this year. Read more from CalMatters’ Kristen Hwang and Ana B. Ibarra.


Closing prisons: California has closed four prisons in recent years, a trend that was enabled by falling numbers of incarcerated people. Newsom wants to close another yet-to-be-determined prison by October 2026, which would save roughly $150 million annually. One big question mark, however: In November, voters passed Proposition 36 to increase penalties for drug- and theft-related crimes. The measure is expected to increase the prison population, though, “we just don’t know how much,” said Newsom on Wednesday. Read more from CalMatters’ Nigel Duara.


Shifting cap-and-trade funds: California’s landmark cap and trade program — which enables companies to buy and trade climate credits — has provided billions of dollars for projects aimed at combating climate change and other environmental issues for more than a decade. Newsom wants to shift some of that money to pay for Cal Fire operations, as well as at least $1 billion a year to fund the High-Speed Rail project.

Bad news on CA housing

From CalMatters housing reporter Ben Christopher:
For all the optimistic legislation, gubernatorial edicts and state-led lawsuits that the state has aimed at boosting the construction of desperately needed homes, California’s housing market stubbornly refuses to cooperate.
As part of the governor’s revised budget, the administration noted that permits for residential construction are at a decade-long low. Fewer than 100,000 new units were permitted in 2024 — a 10% decline from the prior year. The 2025 numbers so far are coming in even lower than expected.
The future doesn’t look much different. Blaming high interest rates, tariffs and tight labor markets for construction workers, Newsom’s budget wonks projected low permits through mid-2027.
The figures were dragged down by a collapse in proposed apartment projects specifically. That’s despite a bevy of prior bills aimed at promoting dense “infill” urban development.
Will two more bills make a difference? Newsom is counting on it. In Wednesday’s presentation he endorsed two of this year’s most controversial bills (Senate Bill 607 and Assembly Bill 609) that would exempt most urban housing projects from the state’s signature environmental law.

Will freezing building codes make housing more affordable?

Speaking of housing, Ben also takes a look at a bill that seeks to make housing more affordable by putting a multi-year pause on building standards — a proposal critics say is misguided.
If passed, the bill wouldn’t negate any of the current building standards, which dictate a building’s plumbing, safety features, electrical wiring and more. Rather, the measure would freeze the rules in place starting on June 1 through at least 2031. That means that California’s 2025 code, which is set to kick in January 2026, wouldn’t go into effect. 
The bill has breezed through the Assembly, likely because its co-author is Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas of Salinas. Proponents say the measure would bring down the cost of construction: Major building standard updates over the last 15 years have added as much as $117,000 to construction costs on each single-family home, according to the California Building Industry Association.
But bill opponents, which include environmental advocates, construction unions and code enforcement officials, argue that the approach is too dramatic of a departure from how the state typically regulates buildings, and that building codes are not the primary cause of high housing costs.

Boston City Councilors voted 8-4 in favor of a home rule petition that would begin the process of implementing ranked-choice voting in the capital city, setting up a potential clash with an often disinterested Legislature.
The post Boston pushes forward on ranked-choice voting appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","THE BOSTON CITY COUNCIL voted 8-4 to implement ranked-choice voting for city elections on Wednesday, tapping on what many consider the first domino in the latest round of ranked-choice voting pushes. The system asks voters to select their candidates in order of preference. In general terms, candidates with the fewest numbers of first choice votes are eliminated over multiple rounds of vote counting, until a candidate emerges with the largest amount of consensus support. In effect, it selects for the candidate most acceptable to most voters. “This is about making sure that we are building a better democracy by electing candidates who are able to build a broad majority of support,” City Council President Ruthzee Louijeune said before the vote on Wednesday. Louijeune worked as an election lawyer in Maine during the country’s first ranked-choice voting congressional election in 2018. Proponents cheer the process as a way to avoid the so-called “spoiler effect” where candidates with less popular support carve off votes from candidates with similar political appeal, leaving the path clear for candidates who may not reflect the interests of most voters but secure the largest vote share in a “winner takes all” election. Spoiler candidates are often discouraged from running and expanding the field, advocates say, for fear that they would harm ideological allies’ chances. Critics decry ranked-choice voting as too complicated for people to understand, arguing that it undermines the intuitive principle that a person would like to vote for a single favored candidate. If a voter only feels strongly about one candidate, but that candidate gets the fewest number of first choice votes, opponents say the voter’s choice is essentially thrown away after the first round of counts. The current system is “simple, clear, [and] makes sure every vote counts,” said City Councilor At-Large Erin Murphy at the council meeting, adding that ranked-choice voting could be confusing to voters who do not speak English as a first language. “Let’s fix our current voting system first,” Councilor Ed Flynn said on Wednesday, referencing issues with the last city election that left polling places in multiple neighborhoods short on ballots and prompted Secretary of State William Galvin to launch an investigation into the Boston Election Department. “Let’s not set up the Boston Election Department for failure,” Flynn said. Louijeune said the city’s election commissioner clearly stated during multiple meetings that the elections department would be “ready and able” to move forward if ranked-choice voting were implemented. The Boston proposal would increase the number of candidates moving from the primary stage to the general election, at which point ranked-choice would take effect, rather than ranked-choice voting starting at the preliminary election.Cambridge is one of the rare US cities to use a proportional ranked-choice voting system, which has been in place since the early 1940s, to elect its local officials. Ranked-choice elections are far from a liberal slam-dunk, as some opponents claim, with moderate candidates like Eric Adams coming out on top of a busy New York City ranked-choice election and Daniel Lurie, an heir to the Levi Strauss fortune who has never held elected office, winning the San Francisco mayor’s race in part because of his dominance in second- and third-choice votes. A bid to bring ranked-choice voting across Massachusetts by ballot measure failed in 2020, by 55 percent to 45 percent. Just five of the state’s 14 counties voted in favor of the measure.  Suffolk County, dominated by the city of Boston, showed up most strongly with just over 60 percent voting in favor of ranked-choice voting. But the statewide loss put a waiting period in place before the subject could be revisited by statewide referendum, because it is unconstitutional for a measure to be put before voters if it is “substantially the same” as another measure submitted in the last two statewide general elections held in even-numbered years. In the meantime, the coalition behind the ranked-choice ballot measure turned its eyes to the Bay State’s capital city. When Cheryl Clyburn Crawford, executive director of MassVOTE, described the Boston push in July 2023, she didn’t point to any problems with the city’s nonpartisan runoff election system, which includes an at-large city council system where voters cast ballots for up to four citywide representatives along with a district councilor.  Rather, she said, the 62 percent of Boston voters who approved of ranked-choice voting indicates “a lot of great interest in rank-choice voting and we wanted it here in Boston. I think ranked-choice voting is absolutely a way to break down additional barriers for people running for office, and those that want to run for office.”  Adopting ranked-choice voting isn’t a simple municipal process. The petition now goes to Mayor Michelle Wu for consideration. If the mayor signs on, which her office told CommonWealth Beacon she will, the matter goes to the State House to join Brookline, Acton, Northampton, and Lexington in waiting for lawmakers to allow them to bring the change to the local ballot for approval by residents. A bill to allow municipalities to skip this Oliver Twist-eqsue process – where legislators from across the state must agree to let localities alter their governing charters – has floundered through the last three sessions. The act to allow a local option for ranked-choice voting in municipal elections, put forward for a fourth time in the state Senate by Sen. Becca Rausch of Needham alongside House counterparts over the years, has been consistently sent to study and killed. Alongside refiling the ranked-choice voting bill, Rausch has filed a more comprehensive piece of legislation this session that would reduce the need for legislative review of local home rule petitions including but not limited to enabling ranked-choice voting. “There is very good policy behind the concept of wanting state legislative review for local work that has statewide impact,” Rausch said. “We should keep it for those types of home rule petitions. But those types of home rules are very few and far between.” Wu’s own election for mayor is occasionally invoked as a potential example of vote-splitting that could have been impacted by ranked-choice.  No Black candidate advanced to the general election despite Andrea Campbell (now state attorney general) and interim Boston Mayor Kim Janey both receiving about 20 percent of the primary vote only to be boxed out for the final by Wu and Annissa Essaibi George. Without any candidate reaching 50 percent in the preliminary, the election would have proceeded to a second round if the city used ranked-choice voting. If the Black voters split between Campbell and Janey, as ranked-choice advocates hypothesize was the case, one of them may well have had a majority of votes in the second round. In 2020, then-City Councilor Wu told the Boston University News Service that she hoped the ranked-choice ballot measure would succeed. “This is a state with a huge pipeline of talent, activism and an incredible energy in terms of people participating and wanting to jump into political office,” she said. “Ranked-choice voting makes sure that we are reflecting the true will of the people.” The post Boston pushes forward on ranked-choice voting appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Boston_City_Hall.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-15 09:03:16.714927
,California,2025-05-15 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,Rejection of Inland Empire warehouse project signals a retreat from California’s decadeslong boom,Jim Newton,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/05/inland-empire-warehouse-development-retreat/,Local and state leaders in California are breaking with decades of inertia and reining in warehouse development. A recent decision in Riverside cemented the shift and elated activists who spent years opposing a major project.,"The residents of an embattled Riverside neighborhood gathered Monday night for a meeting that had implications for their lives, the future of their community and, in a real sense, for the state of democracy.
The meeting was held at a Riverside County building, in a room that can host some 300 people. It was full. An overflow room had space for over 100 more. It was full. A cafe in the building had a few more seats. Those filled up, too. Some people stood along the edges.
The reason, as it so often has been in the Inland Empire in recent years, was warehouses — specifically a proposal to build an industrial and warehouse complex on the edge of the old March Air Force Base.
But the result on this night was different, breaking with decades of political and economic inertia and cementing a genuine sea change that formally emerged last year. After Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill in September reining in warehouse development statewide, San Bernardino County Superior Court overturned an approval for a gigantic project in Bloomington a few weeks later.
Then came Monday’s hearing. A developer, Meridian Park West, had proposed a 3 million-square-foot warehouse space as part of what planners called the West Campus Upper Plateau project, an 818-acre swath of land west of the decommissioned base and surrounded mostly by homes, a church and ballfields. 
The prospect of warehouses on that land infuriated the neighbors, who already navigate the trucks and traffic that come with the Inland Empire’s self-created place in international commerce, a waystation between the Los Angeles and Long Beach ports and the American interior. The warehouse boom in recent decades has brought jobs but also disruption to Riverside and San Bernardino counties, and this project crystallized what has become a difficult choice for many communities: The jobs are tempting, but the price is safety and public health.
In community after community, that debate resolved in favor of jobs. In 1980, there were 234 warehouses spread across this region. Now there are more than 4,000. They cover nearly 40 square miles of land. 
That rampage was virtually uncontested in the early years. But concentration has multiplied the environmental and community impact of these projects. It also focused public attention. Proposals that once sailed through now are encountering more determined opposition. That was starkly on display this week as the March Joint Powers Commission met to discuss, one more time, the ever-evolving proposed project.
The developer this time came with some concessions and window dressing. Recast as the March Innovation Hub, the warehouse pitch was accompanied by a promise to create a center of research and “innovation,” backed by a $4 million endowment. The project footprint had been reduced, highlighted by the new center, which, in theory, would act as a place to explore advances in biotechnology, aviation and transportation, according to the authority’s staff. 
The authority’s staff also recommended the commissioners, made up of various Riverside County politicians, approve the modified project. Their constituents were having none of it. 
Authority officials and the developer made their pitches, leaning heavily on the prospect of new construction jobs and an estimated 3,100 permanent jobs once the complex was built and operating. Hundreds of residents who had assembled for the evening stirred uneasily during those presentations, occasionally interrupting with jeers
When a public opinion researcher hired by the developer reported that the community was evenly divided about the project, “What a lie!” one resident called out. 
Speaker after speaker rose to address the commission. Those in support came almost exclusively from organized labor, in particular building and trade unions. Carpenters, pipe fitters and others spoke up for the jobs that would be created in the construction of the complex.
Unanimous vote
The evening was dominated, however, by opponents. One after another, they ticked off their reasons for wanting the project stopped:
It would bring thousands of truck trips through residential communities. These residents were not buying the staff’s assertion that trucks would be restricted to certain roads — these communities already are overrun by truck traffic, so they’re not easily fooled by assurances.
It would provide jobs, yes, but most of them seemed ill-suited to this area. Warehouse employment is often minimum wage or just above it, and rents in Riverside and surrounding communities are high. One speaker noted that a full-time employee of one of these new warehouses might take home $2,800 a month — income, to be sure, but hard to stretch in an area where rents average $2,000 a month. Workers, then, would have to live in cheaper areas and commute, meaning more traffic.

It would contribute to the region’s stultifying air pollution and health problems that flow from it. Parents told of their asthmatic children struggling to breathe; residents spoke of loved ones moving away in search of healthier places. One doctor responded to the claim that “there’s no such thing as a bad job” by retorting: “There’s no such thing as a good cancer.”
It would demolish the character of the communities around it. These are neighborhoods of private homes. A large church that runs a school and sports programs sits to the south of the project area. What about those residents and parishioners and their priorities, the speakers asked?
It would, to opponents, represent a triumph of money and influence over popular will. “You are our elected officials,” one speaker noted. “Your responsibility is to represent us, not a wealthy developer who does not even live in the county.” Cheers erupted. And others made the same point, to the same applause. “We deserve,” one speaker pointedly noted, “to be protected by the leaders we elected.”
As the night ground on, the developer’s representatives seemed to feel the momentum swinging against them. When it came time to vote, some commissioners entertained the prospect of a compromise: They would approve the project but insert language that specifically prohibited the developer from using any of the land zoned as “industrial” for logistics, the planning word for warehouses.
Desperate for a win, the developer agreed to that condition. That alone offered powerful evidence of how far this debate has shifted. In order to salvage a commercial, industrial project here in the land of warehouses, the developer was willing to jettison the warehouses themselves.

And yet, even that was not enough. Opponents, sensing the possibility of a broader victory, objected. They pressed for a straight up vote on the overall project.
There were a few last gasps. Riverside City Councilmember Chuck Conder sputtered a bit in frustration, defending the region’s air quality and arguing that the project would make traffic “better, not worse.” He stared down disbelieving members of the audience and demanded that residents who opposed this project come back with ideas of their own. 
“Something’s going to be built,” he noted. “Tell us what you want.”
But that felt like the death rattle of an old idea, and the matter plowed ahead to a vote. The commission’s clerk called the roll, and the project died. The vote was unanimous.
Jennifer Larratt-Smith has been one of the leaders of the campaign to kill the warehouses, which she has been fighting for years, often just grateful for a delay. She was among the speakers Monday night, and as she left the meeting room, she beamed, absorbing the congratulations of her neighbors and others. 
She noted that public sentiment against warehouses is shifting. And she noted, with relief, that democracy, as exemplified by the hundreds who petitioned their leaders for help, sometimes prevails.

Is the building code to blame for California's housing crisis?,"In summary
California lawmakers are considering a bill that would pause updates to state housing standards. Is the building code to blame for California’s housing crisis? 


As lawmakers scramble to turbocharge post-fire recovery efforts in Los Angeles and to tackle a housing shortage across the state, a new addition may be coming to California’s building code: A pause button.
Assembly Bill 306 would freeze the building standards — the rules governing the architecture, the layout, the electrical wiring, the plumbing, the energy use and the fire and earthquake safety features — for all new housing through at least 2031. Local governments, which often tack on their own requirements, would also be kept from doing so in most cases. 
Building standards tend to reflect the state’s most pressing concerns. New seismic requirements are added after major earthquakes, home-hardening requirements have followed deadly fires and new green energy mandates have popped up as California has raced to prepare for a warmer planet.
This latest proposed change to the code is meant to tackle another crisis: affordability.
The bill wouldn’t delete any of the current rules, which are widely considered to be among the most stringent of any state’s. It would also include exceptions, most notably for emergency health and safety updates. But on the whole, the California building code would be set on cruise control for the better half of a decade.
Assemblymember Nick Schultz, a freshman Democrat from Burbank and the lead author of the bill, said there’s nothing extreme about leaving the code as it is for a few years, particularly as homeowners in Altadena and the Palisades rebuild. 
Though Schultz introduced the bill, the second listed co-author may explain why such a significant policy change swept through the Assembly with little resistance: Speaker Robert Rivas. In early April the bill passed out of the Assembly with 71 “yes” votes. No lawmakers voted against it. Now it heads to the state Senate.
Such smooth legislative sailing notwithstanding, plenty of environmental advocates, renewable energy industry groups, construction unions, structural engineers and code enforcement officials have turned out to oppose the bill. 
Building standards need to be nimble because the effects of climate change are unpredictable, said Laura Walsh, policy manager with Save the Bay, a nonprofit focused on conservation and preparing for rising seas. They see it as a radical upending of the way the state regulates buildings, reduces emissions and prepares for a changed climate.
“We’ll get to a place in the trend where things get worse really fast,” she said.
Beyond the specifics of the debate, the bill represents something fairly new in the politics of California housing. 
Over the last decade, lawmakers in Sacramento have passed a raft of bills aimed at making it easier to build new homes. Most of those bills have set their sights on the zoning code — the patchwork of land-use standards that dictate which types of buildings can go where. If you recall any high-profile political battles about apartment buildings in exclusive suburbs, dense residential development near transit stops or proposed mountain lion sanctuaries — that’s all about zoning.
Now some lawmakers are considering a new deregulatory target. Schultz’s freeze is the most dramatic example of a handful of bills this year that would take on the impenetrably technical, frequently overlooked and ever-changing building code — all for the cause of cheaper housing. 
As California legislators are “finding religion on land use, other issues are sort of bubbling up,” said Stephen Smith, founder of the Center for Building in North America, a nonprofit that advocates for changes to building codes that make it easier to build apartment buildings. “Architects, developers, contractors are pointing out, ‘No, actually, there are barriers in the actual construction process and many of those do go back to the building code.’”
Where does the building code come from?
California’s building code does not originate in California. 
As with most states, our code takes as its jumping off point a set of general rules written by the International Code Council, a nonprofit organization governed by a mix of building industry associations, state and local regulators, engineers and architects. Despite the name, the organization is based in Washington D.C. and its model codes are a predominantly North American product.
“It’s like naming the World Series the World Series,” said Eduardo Mendoza, a research associate with California YIMBY, an organization that promotes more housing development.
The Code Council puts out its model codes every three years. The state then gets to work on its own version in a year-long process involving seven state departments.

These exceedingly arcane deliberations typically receive little attention from the public. The exception is a small cadre of engineers, developers, architects, appliance manufacturers, energy efficiency, solar and climate advocates and other parties with a direct financial or ideological interest in the way new things get built. 
For these groups, the triannual code adoption cycle — and the “intervening” amendment process for urgent updates — make for an endless game of regulatory tug-of-war.
“It’s all very bureaucratic, very dry, but still extremely political,” said Mendoza.
Now that behind-the-scenes fight is playing out in public. 
On one side are housing developers. Keeping up with the salvo of state and local building code changes is its own full-time job, said Dan Dunmoyer, president of the California Building Industry Association, a trade group for big builders. 
“We had the most seismically safe, water-reduced, fire retardant, energy efficient homes in the world two years ago and we just keep on adding more and more and more to it,” he said. “At what point do you just take a pause?”
A potential pause is especially appealing to many affordable housing developers, who typically rely on multiple sources of funding, all with their own restrictions and timelines. If a change in the building code means going back to the architectural drawing board and delaying a permit application, that can put off a potential project “another year or two,” said Laura Archuleta, president of Jamboree Housing Corporation, a nonprofit low-income housing developer in Irvine.
California would not be the first state to consider tapping the breaks on its building code. In 2023, legislators in North Carolina passed a law banning most changes through 2031. That bill, backed by that state’s building industry association, froze in place a significantly older code than California’s; some of North Carolina’s energy efficiency rules hadn’t been changed since 2009.
California’s so-called 2025 code is currently in the works and is set to go into effect in January 2026, but not if Schultz’s measure passes. The bill would freeze the current rules in place starting on June 1.
The experts who help write the state’s building standards have “health and safety and other criteria in mind but they don’t have cost as a factor in their decision making — well, they should,” said Assemblymember Chris Ward, a San Diego Democrat who voted for Schultz’s bill. He is also the author of two other building code related bills this year. One would require the state to consider subjecting small apartment buildings to a more relaxed set of standards. The other would reevaluate whether builder should have more flexibility in meeting the state’s energy efficiency rules.
Ward said that mining the building code for possible cost savings is an idea embraced by a growing number of his colleagues. 
“The theme of the year has been ‘let’s all focus in on the cost of construction and on reducing the cost of housing,” he said.
What’s the real cost driver?
Opponents of the bill argue that in their quest for affordability, supporters have either picked the wrong villain — or, at the very least, approached the problem with a sledgehammer when what’s needed is a scalpel. 
“There’s just this idea that if you simplify things in some ways, it will help,” said Merrian Borgeson, policy director with Natural Resources Defense Council, who calls the bill “well-intentioned” if fundamentally flawed in its premise. “The driver of cost in California for housing is not code.”
The state’s building industry disagrees.
According to estimates provided by the state industry association, major building standard updates over the last 15 years have added between $51,000 and $117,000 to construction costs on each single-family home. By far the largest estimated cost, with an upper end of $65,000, was the price tag on the water utility hook-up required for sprinkler systems mandated in new single-family homes since 2011. California, Maryland and Washington D.C. are the only state-level jurisdictions with this requirement.
For apartment buildings alone, a national study sponsored by the building industry attributed 11% of total development costs to changes in the International Code Council model codes since 2012. 
It’s impossible to independently verify any of these estimates. But if code changes don’t cost much, developers certainly seem to act as if they do. Reuben Duarte, a land-use planner with the California Chapter of the American Planning Association, said in the months before a scheduled code update, city planning departments are always the scene of “a mad rush from developers who are trying to get in” before the new rules go into effect.
A code for cheaper construction
Most of the big ticket changes to California’s standards over the last decade have been about energy efficiency and electrification. Some of these requirements have added upfront costs for developers, said Matt Vespa, an attorney with the environmental legal nonprofit Earthjustice, but they ultimately save homeowners in the long-run. 
“The cost of housing is just one part of affordability,” he said. He pointed to possible energy code changes that would allow homes to calculate their electricity needs differently, potentially saving on costly capacity upgrades. “Those energy code enhancements could save people money on their energy bills and that is part of affordability. Why is that completely not considered in this equation?”
It’s that prospect of preventing changes to the code that might actually save money that has even some pro-building, “yes in my backyard” advocates concerned about the bill as currently written.
How could the building code make a building less expensive to build? A 2023 law, for example, directs state regulators to consider letting developers build apartment buildings over three stories with just one staircase rather than at least two. Single stair construction is an architectural mainstay outside that United States that allows for more housing to occupy a given lot and is estimated to bring down construction costs on mid-sized apartment buildings by as much as 13% without obviously elevating fire risk.
Schultz’s bill includes a carve out for any future single stair changes. It also includes exceptions for code amendments aimed at making it easier to convert office buildings into apartments and condos, another legislative directive. But additional cost-saving changes could get frozen out. 
One possibility: Dallas, Texas recently adopted a new, relaxed set of codes for mid-sized apartment buildings, a considerable step down from the rules in place in most American cities where they share a set of standards with skyscrapers.
Smith with the Center for Building said he understands why someone who “just doesn’t trust that the building code development process is going to appropriately balance affordability and all the other concerns” would support the bill. But “it’s a little upsetting to see everyone throwing the baby out with the bath water,” he said.
The “baby,” in this case, refers to possible cost-reducing changes that Smith said are more likely to be found for apartment buildings. 
“If I were a single family developer, I’d be a lot more happy with the code as it is than if I were a multifamily developer and a lot more eager to fix it in place,” said Smith.
Schultz stressed that though the bill has already passed out of the Assembly, it remains a work in progress. He said he is currently negotiating possible changes to the bill that would allow for a general “escape hatch” for any proposed “changes to the code that might actually reduce the cost of housing.”
After all, he added, “that is the goal.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/061624_Pleasanton_LE_CM_26.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-15 09:03:16.714927

As a result, those engaging in sex work are often afraid to report crimes or come forward to get medical help, said UNLV sociology professor Barb Brent, who conducted the survey of 334 people.
Assembly Bill 209, sponsored by Democratic Assemblymember David Orentlicher, hopes to change that. The bill would grant sex workers immunity from criminal liability from prostitution-related offenses if they call 911 seeking medical assistance.
Orentlicher said sex workers are “one of our most marginalized communities” and often “face a significantly increased risk of rape and other physical violence.”
“Despite their elevated risk of grave harm, sex workers face a serious barrier to receiving medical care,” he continued. “If they go to the hospital, police may be called in, and sex workers worry that, because they engage in prohibited conduct, they would be arrested.”
AB 209 passed out of the Assembly in April on a party-line vote and was heard by the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday. It must pass out of the committee by Friday or it will be declared dead.
The bill was originally broader and included protections for sex workers who called the police if they were victims or witnesses of crime, including assault or human trafficking. In an attempt to appease law enforcement, Orentlicher narrowed the bill specifically to protect sex workers seeking medical assistance.
The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, the Nevada Sheriffs’ and Chiefs’ Association, and the Nevada Association of District Attorneys still oppose the legislation. 
Eve Hanan, a professor at UNLV’s Boyd School of Law who presented alongside Orentlicher, said nine states have passed similar laws to offer some protections to sex workers who seek medical assistance or report crimes against them.
“This is not the type of bill that has met with opposition in the other states where it’s passed and where it’s being considered,” she told lawmakers. 
Chris Ries, representing LVMPD, asked for examples of police arresting sex workers who seek medical help. Ries said the bill implies that officers would “prioritize an arrest over addressing an emergency situation.”
“During discussions with the proponents, they were unable to provide an example of this,” Ries said. “Bluntly, this does not happen. Perpetuating this inaccurate narrative exacerbates the mistrust.”
He encouraged sex workers to come forward without fear when seeking medical services and emergency assistance. 
But proponents of the bill countered that part of the problem is that people aren’t seeking medical help or reporting crimes out of fear of being arrested.
“This person who is engaging in sex work is incredibly vulnerable to sexual and other forms of assault while she’s engaged in sex work, yet the costs of reporting a serious, violent crime committed against her, they’re simply too high for her to risk reporting,” Hanan said. “It’s a problem of being unable to report out of fear of what the possible consequences would be.”
In a recent study published this year, Brent found 92% of the 334 people interviewed said they don’t think “police takes rape against sex workers seriously.”
Brent submitted written testimony from the people she interviewed. They described “belligerently intoxicated and aggressive” encounters and “predators posing as clients.”
“They count on you (the lawmakers) to keep it this way, so that they can prey on our vulnerability through the law,” wrote one anonymous worker.
While Ries said he didn’t think the bill was needed and suggested people could seek assistance without fear, some Democratic lawmakers pushed back.
“Would you not believe that putting into law proactive and protective measures such as this bill might encourage those victims to come forward more fully because they feel more comfortable, because there are protections in law,” asked Democratic state Sen. Rochelle Nguyen.
Republican state Sen. Ira Hansen said the legislation seemed like a Band-Aid to a larger problem and questioned why Clark County didn’t just legalize prostitution. He later clarified he would be against any measure to decriminalize sex work. 
AB 209 is supported by the ACLU of Nevada, the Nevada Fines and Fees Justice Center, and both Clark and Washoe public defenders office
“By removing the fear of arrest by seeking emergency and medical care, we can reduce harm, save lives and build bridges between vulnerable individuals and the support systems that they so desperately need,” said Angela Knott with the Washoe County Public Defender’s Office.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/metro-lvmpd-ronda-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-15 09:03:16.714927

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The Iowa Legislature adjourned Thursday at 6:01 a.m. in the Senate and 6:31 a.m. in the House, finishing the 2025 legislative session with many priorities from the majority party met — but with several major goals, including property taxes, not making the cut.
While leaders reflected on successfully moving forward on many of their top objectives, the final few days of the 2025 legislative session were tense between some members of the majority party. Twelve Republican senators had announced they would not vote in support of any budget bills until the Senate voted on House File 639, a bill containing multiple measures related to the use of eminent domain in carbon sequestration pipeline projects.
On Monday, the bill passed the Senate 27-22 following hours of heated debate and days of closed-door meetings discussing the measure, which included many barbed comments traded between Republicans.

Rep. Steven Holt, R-Denison, told reporters he believed the eminent domain legislation was the most pivotal bill to move during the 2025 session.
“The fact that it was finally taken up in the Senate certainly sticks out to me,” Holt said. “But unfortunately, it also sticks out to me … as a Republican, the unfortunate debate that occurred in the Senate, in terms of Republicans sort of going after one another. It’s something that we don’t normally see, and I hope we never see again.”
Holt said he was “confident” that Gov. Kim Reynolds will sign the bill into law, though other lawmakers have expressed doubts that she will grant the measure final approval.
While the pipeline bill was brought up for debate, another high-profile measure from the session was not — the Republicans’ property tax proposal. The Senate Ways and Means Committee approved Senate File 651, the most recent version of the proposal eliminating Iowa’s “rollback” system of calculating local property taxes, in a meeting earlier in May, but the measure was not brought for floor debate in either chamber.
Here’s what Iowa lawmakers did on marathon final day of session

House Minority Leader Jennifer Konfrst said her biggest takeaway from the 2025 legislative session was that lawmakers did nothing to lower costs for Iowa families.
“If anything, all they did was raise costs, especially when it comes to property taxes, that now could go up and count the districts across the state because they didn’t fund public education enough,” Konfrst said, referring to the K-12 funding package that Democrats said will trigger property tax increases in many Iowa public schools. “They did nothing, nothing for housing … They did nothing to fix health care costs, except put 182,000 people, their health insurance at risk. They did absolutely nothing to help the economy.”
Reynolds said in a statement early Thursday property taxes would be a top issue in the 2026 session, alongside further government efficiency efforts.
“I look forward to continuing this work next session — especially when it comes to reducing Iowans’ property tax burden,” Reynolds said in the statement. “And to make sure tax cuts remain sustainable, even as we continue to make smart investments, we’ll keep streamlining government. Our alignment efforts, so far, have already saved taxpayers more than $250 million, and we’re just getting started.”
Senate Majority Leader Jack Whitver said the Legislature did take action to lower costs for Iowans as the the state’s economy “is under a lot of pressure from outside issues,” pointing to the bill passed Thursday to reduce unemployment insurance taxes, a priority of Reynolds.
“At the start of this legislative session, we told Iowans, ‘We hear you,'” Whitver said in a statement on his closing remarks for the session. “We hear your concerns about the high costs in our everyday lives, the concerns about costs and access to health care, and concerns about safe communities.”
In the final days of session, the Legislature approved some of the top proposals laid out by Reynolds for the 2025 legislative session, including the unemployment insurance taxes, as well as the bill on paid parental leave for government employees and another aiding rural health care and expanding medical residency slots. Several of the goals she laid out in her January Condition of the State address — like the two bills restricting cellphone use during class time and behind the wheel of a car, and her bill providing natural disaster aid for communities impacted by 2024 floods and tornadoes, were all signed into law earlier this session.
But there were some bills that did not make it to her desk. The House did not take up Senate File 445, the governor’s child care infrastructure bill to shift funding from Early Childhood Iowa (ECI) and some federal funds to establish a new grant program for preschool and child care centers providing full-day care for children, though it was passed by the Senate. Her energy proposal that would have given existing utility companies the right of first refusal to new transmission projects — which received pushback from the U.S. Department of Justice — also did not advance.
The first measure signed into law in 2025 was the repeal of gender identity protections under the Iowa Civil Rights Act. The law came up in budget discussions in the days before session ended, as the health and human services spending bill included a restriction on Medicaid coverage for sex reassignment surgery and hormone replacement therapy for transgender individuals. Some GOP lawmakers said this limit is now legal because of “gender identity” was removed as a protected class under state civil rights law, but Democrats argued the measure remains unconstitutional — as ruled previously in courts — under the Equal Protections Clause.
Republican legislative leaders did not mention the gender identity law in their closing comments, but did praise the passage of a bill setting Medicaid work requirements on Iowa’s expanded Medicaid program.
The bill sent to Reynolds Wednesday would set an 80-hour work requirement per month for people on the Iowa Health and Wellness Plan, or IHAWP, to retain eligibility for health coverage. IHAWP provides Medicaid coverage for low-income, able-bodied adults between ages 19 to 64. The bill passed includes certain exceptions to the work requirements. It also includes “trigger” language that would end the program if the federal government first allows Iowa to enact work requirements and then later revokes approval.
The governor and Iowa Department of Health and Human Services have independently pursued IHAWP work requirements, submitting a federal waiver for similar requirements at 100 hours per month to keep health coverage with exceptions. Senate President Amy Sinclair said in her closing comments for the session work requirements are “common sense.”
“There is dignity in work, and the vast majority of Iowans know this,” Sinclair said in the written comments. “Having a sense of purpose and accomplishment is not only good for one’s well-being, but it is good for our state. Enacting policies that help put people back to work, like work requirements for able-bodied Iowans on assistance programs, provides opportunities for Iowans to earn a living, find a sense of purpose, and contribute to the growth of our economy.”

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)After a lengthy hearing that ran overnight and amid orders from President Donald Trump to reduce the national deficit, a U.S. House committee advanced a tax bill that, among many other actions, would phase out clean energy initiatives from the Biden administration that have substantially contributed to energy developments in Utah.
The House Ways and Means Committee, the chief tax-writing panel in the House, approved its bill that, bundled with other bills, make up Republicans’ “big, beautiful bill” on Wednesday. With full Congressional approval, the large reconciliation package would establish some Trump priorities, including eliminating the tax on tips, paving the way for a national school choice voucher program, and eliminating major programs from President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, a 2022 federal law that propelled clean energy investments. 
Environmentalists in the state expressed deep concerns when the proposal was unveiled on Monday that some federal tax credits for clean energy developments, electric vehicles, home energy efficiency upgrades, and manufacturing projects would either be eliminated or phased out early. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Some pointed out that repealing these energy incentives would drive up electricity prices in Utah. According to a study by Rhodium Group, an independent research provider, energy bills would rise between 2.5% and 5.5% in Utah if the tax credits were to be repealed. Another study from Energy Innovation, an energy and climate policy think tank, indicates that the action could increase energy costs for an average Utah household by $20 annually in 2030, and more than $120 a year in 2035.
“Current federal policies, such as clean energy tax credits, grants, loans, and standards accelerate clean energy project deployment and electric vehicle sales in Utah,” Energy Innovation wrote in the report. “But repealing these policies would force Utah households to pay higher electricity bills because less low-cost clean energy is being built, while fewer EVs on the road would force consumers to spend more on gasoline.”
Simultaneously, phasing out the clean energy tax credits would eliminate the prospects of supporting 3,200 jobs annually, and $50 million in local tax revenue by 2032, according to BW Research and the Nature Conservancy.
Josh Craft, director of government relations and public affairs at the nonprofit Utah Clean Energy, said in a statement that this proposed budget would make it much harder to bring the necessary clean energy and other efficiency resources to meet Utah’s growing needs.



Let us know what you think...


 


“Clean energy tax credits are critical to harnessing Utah’s plentiful solar, geothermal, and energy storage resources this decade,” Craft said. “The House should revise the final reconciliation bill to maintain robust clean energy tax credits that are workable for Utah businesses and communities.”
Republicans voted along party lines to advance the draft to the House floor, including Utah Republican Rep. Blake Moore, who sits on the House Ways and Means Committee and praised the bill in a social media post, arguing that it would keep taxes low for families, workers and businesses.
“Today we will advance policies that prevent a major tax hike on hardworking Americans, provide financial relief for families and parents, put American workers first, fuel economic growth, make American companies more competitive, and lower taxes for our farmers,” Moore wrote. 
However, his nod to the bill didn’t sit well among some Utah environmentalists. Rebekah Ashley, Sierra Club Utah’s lead organizer on climate and energy described it as “deeply disappointing” and “a disservice to Utahns.”
The organization lamented the bill’s progress in a news release, since the tax credits had propelled some of the state’s most important clean energy projects recently, including Fervo’s Cape Station, located in Beaver County, which is set to become the largest next-generation geothermal project in the world. The incentives also helped to make possible the Green River Energy Center in Emery County, which is poised to become one the country’s largest solar and storage facilities.
“It blocks economic opportunity, puts good-paying jobs out of reach, and makes it harder for families to afford home energy upgrades that lower monthly bills and improve quality of life,” Ashley said in a statement. “These clean energy tax credits have supported some of Utah’s most exciting and forward looking projects, but by voting to rollback these investments, Rep. Moore is turning his back on the clean energy future that Utahns deserve.”

Senate Democrats, upset after a dispute between the House and a senator over a gambling bill for Greene County, managed to slow consideration of an agenda of 50 local House bills in the chamber, which Senate President Pro Tempore Garlan Gudger, R-Cullman, said last week would be his priority for the last day of session.
“We’re going to use the tools we have to make happen what we need to make happen,” said Senate Minority Leader Bobby Singleton, D-Greensboro, whose criticism of the House’s handling of a local gambling bill led to the slowdown.

Republicans repeatedly clotured Singleton and Sen. Rodger Smitherman, D-Birmingham, the other major figure in the filibuster, limiting debate to 20 minutes. But Democrats  asked for each bill to be read in its entirety and for a roll call vote on each motion. After about six hours, the Senate had only passed about 11 of the bills on its calendar.
Smitherman  later said that he felt locked out of the political process after discussing lawmakers from the same region working together to address local issues. Not being afforded the same luxury, he said the tools to represent his constituents effectively were taken away.

“I just couldn’t do what I needed to do. That’s all … when you’ve got no tools, you can build nothing. My tools were put in the toolshed, and they locked the door,” Smitherman said, saying he’s “trying to knock on the door.”
The Republican-led chambers managed to pass HB 202, sponsored by Rep. Rex Reynolds, R-Huntsville, which extends police immunity protections. The legislation, a priority for GOP lawmakers and Gov. Kay Ivey, in the waning minutes of the session on Wednesday.  In the House, the chamber concurred with Senate changes on HB 199, sponsored by Rep. Travis Hedrix, D-Birmingham, that allows the Board of Pardons and parole to electronically monitor a juvenile delinquent before their court hearing.
But the Senate filibuster dominated most of the day. After the Shroud Award was presented to Rep. Ron Bolton, R-Northport, early Wednesday afternoon,
House Speaker Nathaniel Ledbetter, R-Rainsville, said a farewell and thanked the chamber for all their work this session.
“You guys are like family to me. I love each one of you, and we pray every night for success throughout the districts,” Ledbetter said. “And I can’t be more proud of a group of men and women that serve the people of Alabama.”
The House then recessed for nine hours to wait for the Senate to pass the police immunity bill. The slow grind Wednesday brought an end to a session that saw several notable pieces of legislation passed.

Lawmakers approved a bill banning firearm modifications known as “Glock switches,” which convert semi-automatic handguns into fully automatic weapons. The bill was the first gun restriction to pass the Alabama House since 2010, and passed after Rep. Philip Ensler, D-Montgomery, introduced similar legislation the year before.
The Legislature also passed legislation to change the state’s public school funding formula to help address the needs of underserved students through a new funding system. But Republican lawmakers also pumped $180 million into the CHOOSE Act, a voucher-like program in which families can claim tax credits for nonpublic education expenses, including private school tuition. The allocation far exceeded the $100 million lawmakers originally put into the bill.
Lawmakers rushed through the “What is a Woman Act” early in the session, provides definitions for sex, male, female, man, woman, boy, girl, mother and father. Critics said the bill  attempted to erase trans and intersex identities. Lawmakers also passed bills targeting immigrants.
Ledbetter highlighted the a bill regulating pharmacy benefit managers, a cut on the grocery tax and a bill allowing the state’s dominant agricultural organization to offer its members health benefit plans.
“I think we got a lot to be proud of, lots to hang our hat on,” he said.
Ledbetter said he was surprised HB 188, sponsored by Rep. Allen Treadaway, R-Morris, did not receive final passage. The bill would have created a scholarship program for dependents of law enforcement, which passed the House in February.
“I really don’t even understand that one,” Ledbetter said. “It’s pretty simple to me, because we give everybody else scholarships. If we’re really trying to protect the police officers and in this state, and back the blue then, to me, that’s a no brainer.”
Gudger said after the Senate adjourned that despite the partisan tensions of the last day, he felt like there was cooperation. He said that they could have concluded the debate sooner, but he wanted to make sure members “were treated as fairly as possible.”
“You heard some people tonight saying they didn’t treat them fairly tonight, but if you look back into how many minutes they’ve had at the mic, I think they’ve had more movements than anybody else on the floor. You’ve got to be able to balance that, and so you can’t look at just one night,” he said.

Gudger signaled the Senate might work on potential rule changes to improve efficiency before the next legislative session, particularly in handling local legislation.
“It would be, how do we handle local legislation and it be fair so that one person can’t hold up the whole legislature,” he said. “In the Senate, you’re able to do that, but I think there needs to be more of a group that needs to say, ‘this is something we don’t want as a delegation’ before you hold up everyone’s local bills,” Gudger said.
Smitherman, shortly before the Senate adjourned, asked the lawmakers to reassess how they’ll conduct business when they return next year.
“All of us want to take something home. You all want to take something home. We want to take something home. And where it is now, it’s not working out like that, so I hope you all reassess when we come back,” Smitherman said.

HB 16 is identical to a ballot measure slated for a statewide vote in 2026. If HB 16 becomes law, that measure would be canceled, and the 2026 elections would move forward with donation limits in place.
HB 16 proposes to limit Alaskans to $2,000 in donations per candidate in each two-year election cycle. For the governor’s race, where a lieutenant governor candidate and governor candidate run together on a single ticket, the limit would be $4,000. The limit for donations from one person to a political party or group would be $5,000.
If a group wants to donate to a candidate, the limit is $4,000, or $8,000 for the governor’s race.
Those limits would be adjusted for inflation every 10 years.
The new limits are required because a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in 2021 that the state’s prior limits were unconstitutional. The Dunleavy administration declined to appeal that ruling.
On Wednesday, Sen. James Kaufman, R-Anchorage, proposed amending the bill to include higher donation limits equivalent to those in federal law.
The committee voted down that amendment, and Schrage said he prefers to keep the bill in line with the ballot measure.
Doing otherwise could run afoul of a clause of the Alaska Constitution that says the Legislature can override an upcoming ballot measure only if it enacts a law “substantially similar” to the measure.
HB 16 is expected to move in parallel with Senate Bill 64, an elections bill moving toward a final vote in the state House, multiple lawmakers said, meaning that both bills are expected to reach final votes about the same time.

The Legislature Wednesday gave final approval to the bill, sending it to Gov. Kay Ivey. (Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama Legislature passed a bill to enhance immunity protections for law enforcement in the final hours of the 2025 legislative session Wednesday. 
HB 202, sponsored by Rep. Rex Reynolds, R-Huntsville, changes the standard by which law enforcement can claim immunity as they perform their jobs and gives them additional procedural protections during litigation. 
The debate showed the stark differences in experiences with law enforcement between Republican lawmakers, nearly all of whom are white, and Democratic lawmakers, nearly all of whom are Black.

Democratic senators, who said the legislation would give law enforcement a “license to kill” during debate, raised concerns that the bill could put nonwhite Alabamians at a higher risk of being victims of police brutality.
“You will have blood on your hands,” said Sen. Merika Coleman, D-Pleasant Grove.

Reynolds, a retired police chief, said after the House convened that while he hears the concerns of his Democratic colleagues, he also thinks about the families of fallen police officers.
“But we turn that nickel around, and we’ve got to say the same thing about our fallen officers,” Reynolds said. “We hope it will restore some faith in our officers, that we do have their back in Alabama. We hope it increases recruitment and helps for the retention of our officers.”
The bill the Senate passed 25-6 after a nearly two-hour debate and went back to the House for concurrence due to Senate changes. The House voted to concurred shortly after, sending the bill to Gov. Kay Ivey. Ivey wrote in a social media post that she looked forward to “swiftly signing it into law.”
Currently, law enforcement officers can face prosecution or lawsuits if they act “willfully, maliciously, fraudulently, in bad faith, beyond his or her authority, or under a mistaken interpretation of the law.” Under the legislation, the officer would have to violate rights explicitly outlined in the constitutions of Alabama or the United States.
The legislation grants law enforcement officers a hearing at the start of civil or criminal cases to determine if their actions were within their discretionary authority. If the court rules in favor of the officer, the case is dismissed. If the appeal is rejected, the officer can appeal the verdict to the Alabama Supreme Court, but the appeal is time-limited. Even if the appeal is rejected, the officer can continue to assert their defense.
Sen. Robert Stewart, D-Selma, asked Sen. Lance Bell, R-Pell City, who handled the bill in the Senate,f the intent of the bill was because of the “dangerous” nature of police work, which Bell said was one of the reasons. Stewart said that the Bureau of Labor Statistics identifies professions like log work and construction, but “unfortunately, law enforcement is not included.”
“I’m talking about the true intent this legislation gives the veneer that it is about protecting police officers, but we know that this is about outsized influence,” Stewart said, saying that the bill comes at a more “inopportune time” after the Hanceville Police Department was disbanded following the arrest of the police chief and four officers.
“This legislation erodes public trust. A grand jury investigation revealed that a rampant culture of corruption within the department,” he said.
Under the bill, plaintiffs can’t gather evidence during discovery in civil cases when the officer requests dismissal. They can also obtain video footage in civil lawsuits but not criminal cases. A study commission will evaluate the legislation’s impact on law enforcement recruitment and retention. Under the legislation, law enforcement agencies must collect and submit data to the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency about excessive force committed by officers and the race and ethnicity of both officers and victims.
Senate Minority Leader Bobby Singleton, D-Greensboro, tried to amend the bill so that law enforcement training would be uniform across the state, but Bell said that was an unfriendly amendment, saying that law enforcement already receives adequate training.
“Before we can carry a gun, before you’re putting a badge on and going out there, you have all kinds of training on those scenarios,” Bell said during the debate.
The House debated Reynolds’ motion to concur in Senate changes for about 45 minutes. Rep. Ontario Tillman, D-Bessemer, brought similar concerns as he did when the legislation passed the House on March 6.
“I still have my concerns about this bill,” Tillman said. “What it is actually doing is taking away judicial discretion. It is dictating to the courts and judges on how they should view police officers.”
After Tillman and other Black Democrats spoke on the bill, debate was clotured, limiting the rest of debate to 10 minutes. Rep. Phillip Ensler, D-Montgomery, the only white Democrat to speak against the bill, asked Reynolds to look at the situation from an empathy standpoint.
“At the end of the day I think about… just hearing my colleagues over and over again, individuals that don’t look like us, very candidly. The concerns about Black men that will be disproportionately affected by this,” he said.
Rep. Napoleon Bracy, D-Prichard, asked for the bill to be read at length with about two minutes left of debate and with about 25 minutes left of Legislative session.
“At concurrence, on the third reading, the bill cannot be read at length,” House Speaker Nathaniel Ledbetter told Bracy.
The House concurred 73-28 with Senate changes with 24 minutes left of the session.
House Speaker Nathaniel Ledbetter commended Reynolds after the Legislature adjourned on Wednesday.
“I can’t thank our members enough to stay into the late hour to try to get a bill that was important to law enforcement across the state,” he said. “The men and women in blue protect us every morning that and every afternoon, and we just had to stay another hour and a half to give them a protection.”
Sen. Kirk Hatcher, D-Montgomery, pointed to the “legacy” of police violence and the reason that Black senators are the ones speaking against the bill is because Black Americans are often those impacted by this violence, saying that “it is very hard to even remotely feel what we feel about this.”
“One of the things I struggle with is how easy it is for so many of my colleagues to compartmentalize things like this,” Hatcher said, saying that if he were in his Republican colleagues’ position, he “would be sensitive to what happens to (their) children.”
Hatcher said there was no justification for the legislation and warned that the body will be held accountable for the laws they choose to codify into law. 
“This train has left the station,” Hatcher said. “But we can make very clear, this law does not protect good cops.”

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Paul Burns: Vermonters deserve real climate action, not delays and denials.","This commentary is by Paul Burns, executive director of the Vermont Public Interest Research Group.The Scott administration’s dismissal of recent climate laws passed by the Legislature as offering “only theoretical benefits” is pure political theater from officials who know better.After nearly a decade in charge, Gov. Phil Scott and his administration have failed to deliver the responsible climate action Vermonters expect and deserve. The May 4 op-ed by Sec. Julie Moore and Commissioner Kerrick Johnson isn’t just misleading — it’s insulting to the Vermonters who are paying for the costs of a warming world and need real solutions.READ MORE
Let’s be clear: the Climate Superfund Act is not theoretical. It’s a concrete, common-sense law that says fossil fuel companies — the world’s biggest polluters — should pay their fair share to clean up the mess they made. Vermont taxpayers and communities shouldn’t bear the full cost of the climate disasters these billion-dollar corporations knowingly helped cause.This isn’t a radical idea. It’s responsible governance.Moore and Johnson’s sudden concern over implementation funding is transparently disingenuous. They suggest that legislators “perhaps believe that funding this work is somehow optional,” when Gov. Scott included not one dime for Climate Superfund Act implementation in his proposed budget. They also complain that a version of the budget under consideration earlier this year didn’t include that funding — conveniently ignoring that the budget that passed the Senate just last week did. Is it essential that the Legislature pass a budget with that funding included? Absolutely. Is there even the slightest hint Gov. Scott will help make that happen? No. In fact, as of this writing the House GOP negotiator on the budget succeeded in getting that funding – that Moore and Johnson call “imperative” – to be cut in half. This is a familiar pattern.For nine years, the Scott administration, aided by most Republicans in the legislature, has dragged its feet on climate policy:They’ve opposed nearly every meaningful piece of climate legislation.
They’ve routinely dismissed strategies recommended by the governor’s own Climate Action Commission and the Vermont Climate Council.
They’ve failed to put forward serious proposals of their own to reduce emissions.
And they’ve opposed renewable energy development, making it harder to build affordable clean energy right here in Vermont. The economic toll of their inaction is real. Vermont’s clean energy sector was once one of the fastest-growing in the state — up 29% between 2013 and 2017 and employing over 19,000 people. Today, fewer Vermonters work in clean energy than when Phil Scott took office.And though the administration’s opinion piece gives lip service to weatherization and EVs, Gov. Scott’s primary proposal on that front is to raid Efficiency Vermont’s work and claim credit for repurposing funds that are already saving Vermonters money.  While other states move forward, Vermont has stalled. The Scott administration’s failure to support forward-looking energy policy has stifled innovation, cost jobs and robbed rural communities of millions in investment.President Trump denies the climate crisis even exists. Gov. Scott and his team admit the problem exists, but they just don’t want to do anything about it. It’s a distinction with little difference and in the end, the only ones who benefit are the polluters. Now, Moore and Johnson are trying to gaslight Vermonters into thinking they are the problem. Their complaint about “special interests” pushing for accountability and action is deeply cynical. Who are these so-called special interests? Regular Vermonters — parents, farmers, students, workers — tired of broken promises and demanding a livable future.The Global Warming Solutions Act gives the people of Vermont the right to hold their government accountable when it fails to meet its obligations. That’s not a loophole — it’s democracy. The administration’s effort to undermine that right is an attempt to strip Vermonters of their voice. It’s also an admission that they have no intention of getting the job done.Meanwhile, the Climate Superfund Act is exactly the kind of innovative policy Vermont should champion. Modeled after the federal Superfund law that’s held corporate polluters accountable for decades, it uses science to link emissions to damages, directs the Treasurer to calculate climate-related costs from carbon pollution and prepares Vermont to seek compensation from massive corporations that profited while Vermonters’ livelihoods washed downstream.It’s time to stand up for Vermonters and not for the corporate polluters that have caused our people and communities so much harm. We need leadership brave enough to take on powerful interests, smart enough to embrace innovation, and honest enough to step aside when it’s not up to the task.The Climate Superfund Act and Global Warming Solutions Act aren’t the problem. The real problem is a governor and administration who’ve lost sight of their responsibility to the people they serve.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Paul Burns: Vermonters deserve real climate action, not delays and denials.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Commentaries_featured-image-25.png,,,2025-05-15 07:05:32.305057

Nader Hashim, D-Windham, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and by Rep. Martin LaLonde, D-South Burlington, chair of the House Judiciary Committee.When floodwaters tore through Vermont in July 2023 and then again exactly a year later, they left more than physical destruction in their wake. They also revealed to Vermonters the mounting price tag of climate change. While national media attention may have shifted to climate change catastrophes in other parts of the country, Vermont families are still displaced, businesses are shuttered or drowning in debt, and communities are struggling to rebuild.The financial toll of climate change in Vermont is real and ongoing. Every washed-out road, damaged bridge and flooded home and business represents a cost someone must pay — and right now, that burden falls squarely on Vermont taxpayers. We see it through higher property taxes, rising insurance premiums and reduced municipal services.This dire reality prompted our legislature to pass the Climate Superfund Act, applying the same principle that has governed environmental cleanup for more than 40 years: Those who contribute to a problem should help pay for its solution.Overwhelming scientific consensus tells us that some of the world’s largest and most profitable fossil fuel corporations are at the root of the climate crisis. For decades, these corporations knew their products were likely to cause the kind of costly damage Vermont increasingly faces as the planet overheats.Vermont’s Climate Superfund Act applies this established polluter-pays approach to the mounting costs of our climate-related disasters, requiring these corporations to pay their fair share and help clean up the climate mess their products and activities have caused.Americans across the political spectrum have long embraced the ethical standard that when someone makes a mess, they should help clean it up. Directing these massive fossil fuel corporations to contribute to recovery efforts isn’t radical, it’s basic fairness.The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court of Vermont to stop the law from being enforced. DOJ makes several claims including that the Climate Superfund Act is preempted by the Clean Air Act, exceeds the territorial reach of Vermont’s legislative power, unlawfully discriminates against interstate commerce, conflicts with federal interstate commerce power, and is preempted by federal foreign-affairs powers.Last year, when we took up the bill that would become the Climate Superfund Act, the House and Senate Judiciary Committees vetted the legal and constitutional claims that could be made against the Act and we were confident that it would stand up in court.As chairs of the Vermont General Assembly’s Judiciary Committees, we take our legal and constitutional obligations seriously. We appreciate the proper balance between state and federal authority. States have long served as the proving grounds for practical solutions to our challenges, and Vermont’s Climate Superfund Act continues this proud tradition.The law establishes a careful, science-based process to determine which companies should contribute and how much, ensuring fairness while addressing pressing needs.This law passed with strong support from Vermonters of all political parties, but we knew that powerful interests would fight back. The recently filed lawsuits against Vermont and our neighbors in New York, who passed their own Climate Superfund Act, merely confirms what we already understood: Our approach is effective enough to warrant powerful opposition.Vermont has always stood firm in defending our right to protect our citizens and preserve our way of life. From our founding days to the present, we’ve maintained that local solutions often best address local problems. We deeply appreciate the work Vermont’s congressional delegation and state officials are doing to defend our state’s authority, and call on them to continue that work as long as necessary. We must hold accountable those who profit while others pay the price.Climate change presents unprecedented challenges but addressing them requires the same principles of responsibility and fairness that have always guided our legal system. Vermont’s Climate Superfund Act upholds these principles while protecting taxpayers from bearing costs they shouldn’t have to shoulder alone.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Sen.

(Getty Images)In less than a week, Indiana is set to execute Benjamin Ritchie, a man with significant brain damage due to Partial Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (pFAS) and exposure to multiple neurotoxins, even though no jury was ever presented with evidence about Ritchie’s multiple impairments.
His trial lawyers never identified or even investigated his condition. This is not completely surprising because pFAS is sometimes missed due to the fact that the facial abnormalities are not as apparent as they are for individuals who have other forms of the condition, but the brain damage is just as severe. Individuals with pFAS should be afforded the same constitutional protections against execution that those with intellectual disabilities have received for the last 23 years.
Exposure to alcohol while in utero can affect every stage of an individual’s brain development and cause long-term deficits with regards to cognitive, motor, and behavioral functions. Neuroimaging studies have found that prenatal alcohol exposure leads to a decrease in brain volume/size, reductions in gray matter, and disorganization of the central nervous system, as well as other brain abnormalities.
Individuals with pFAS, like Ritchie, typically demonstrate deficits with executive functioning, including cognitive processes like working memory, problem solving, planning, and response inhibition. They may also lack impulse control, concept formation, and adaptive functioning skills which are necessary for everyday life, including the development of appropriate social relationships. Ritchie’s impairments directly contribute to his lack of capacity for rationality and his limited ability to reflect on the potential outcomes of his behavior.

The fact that he was only 20 years old at the time of the crime may also have played a role because brain scientists have discovered that in a healthy individual, the parts of the brain responsible for impulse control are not fully developed until age 25. One expert found that, at the time of the crime, Ritchie’s functional age due to his multiple impairments was more similar to a child or adolescent’s than a 20-year-old. Throughout his life, he has consistently been less capable of resisting his social and emotional impulses than most individuals his age.
The national organization, FASD United, believes that it is critical that judges, jurors, prosecutors, and corrections officers are educated about pFAS and are made aware that experts have determined that its impact on individuals is functionally the same as an intellectual disability. Minnesota and Alaska have appropriately codified Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders as developmental disabilities. The U.S. Supreme Court determined in 2002 that death is not the appropriate punishment for individuals with intellectual disability because they are less culpable for their actions. The same should be true for individuals with pFAS and related conditions.
Ritchie was also exposed to excessive amounts of neurotoxins as a child, which may have compounded his impairments. From conception to age five, when the brain is most malleable and vulnerable to injury, he was exposed to three highly neurotoxic agents – alcohol, multiple psychoactive drugs, and lead, increasing his risk of neurological deficits.
If any of this information about Ritchie’s multiple impairments had been properly investigated and presented to the jury; he may never have been sentenced to death. At the time of trial, he even offered to accept a sentence of life without parole. Unfortunately, the Indiana Supreme Court voted 2-2 to deny Ritchie’s request to consider this new information even though all four voting justices acknowledged there was ample evidence of his brain damage due to pFAS.
Ritchie’s execution should not proceed under these circumstances.

Jiahong Pan/Minnesota Reformer.The Minnesota Legislature is debating whether our state highway system and the funds that maintain it should serve all Minnesotans regardless of how they travel — or continue to serve just cars and trucks.
For seasoned lawmakers and transportation advocates, the question of highway purposes is not new. It’s been debated in commissions, committees and courtrooms for decades
This ongoing debate centers on a crucial question: Who is our road system for, and how can we most efficiently invest in a transportation system that serves the diverse ways Minnesotans move today and will move tomorrow?
Minnesota established our current highway funding structure through two key constitutional amendments. First, a 1920s amendment created what’s known as the trunk highway system and established a dedicated funding structure. Later, a 1950s amendment established the Highway User Tax Distribution Fund we see today, directing motor fuel and vehicle registration taxes to fund highway expenses through a constitutional formula. This funding is dedicated to “highway purposes.”  
In the years since, the purpose of highways has been interpreted narrowly to prioritize cars and trucks, failing to address today’s diverse transportation needs. 
State highways comprise more than just big freeways like I-94. They include thoroughfares like Snelling Avenue in St. Paul, Central Avenue in Minneapolis and main streets in smaller communities, and they often serve multiple functions beyond moving vehicles. They are economic corridors, social spaces, and critical connections for people walking, biking, rolling, and using transit.
Restricting transportation funding to car and truck infrastructure creates barriers to funding comprehensive projects. When it’s appropriate to build transit, bike or pedestrian elements, those components can require separate funding sources and could lead to misaligned projects. 
For example, MnDOT and Met Council proposed a one-time funding partnership this session where Met Council would loan funds to MnDOT to align a highway project with the F Line bus rapid transit construction along North Metro trunk highways. This coordination would allow simultaneous road repairs with transit investments and bike and pedestrian safety improvements. According to MnDOT, failing to align these projects could cost taxpayers an additional $18 million, create redundant work, and cause two extra years of travel disruptions.
These inefficiencies extend beyond one project, creating a fragmented approach that undercuts the financing and development of a truly multi-modal system that is safe and affordable. Aligning the way we invest could save us significantly in the long run and bring us more efficient investments in all modes of transportation concurrently.

State Sen. Omar Fateh and Rep. Samantha Sencer-Mura, along with Our Streets and other transportation leaders and advocates, are trying to broaden Minnesota’s vision, including language in the Senate transportation bill (SF2438) that would clarify that highway purposes include transit, active transportation and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from the trunk highway system, which is an important step in realizing our state’s transportation goals. Colorado passed a similar bill in 2013, and MnDOT is largely supportive of this more flexible funding approach. 
Here is what makes this change so impactful: 
It creates a transportation system for everyone 
Our transportation system must serve all Minnesotans and all types of communities equitably. When highways cut through communities, residents deserve safe crossings, transit access and bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure regardless of geography, age, ability, race or income. 
In urban and rural areas alike, state highways that double as neighborhood corridors and main streets need designs that support local businesses and community life, not just through-traffic. Mobility is a fundamental right that extends beyond car ownership and can create benefits within and beyond the curbline. 
It makes fiscal sense 
In the practical sense, especially given our state’s fiscal outlook, clarifying highway purposes will create a pragmatic, flexible and holistic approach to investing in transportation. Opponents cite maintenance burdens on our existing road system and maintain that “leakage” of funds meant for highways will undercut our ability to maintain roads. 
Minnesota’s continual efforts to add lanes to our road system — we already own the fourth most lane miles of any state in the U.S.— creates a much bigger maintenance burden than what we’re proposing. 
We face a $17.8  billion funding gap for maintenance on our highway system, stagnant traffic fatalities, increasing demand for affordable and sustainable transportation options, and significant uncertainty when it comes to federal money. So, there has never been a more important moment to flexibly invest, allowing us to provide a variety of transportation choices and do more and better with fewer resources.
It’s constitutionally sound 
Our constitutional amendments didn’t intend to restrict trunk highway funding to cars alone.  They promised to serve communities through any reasonable means of transportation along designated routes. The courts affirmed this broad interpretation in a 1958 case, Minneapolis Gas Co. v Zimmermann, establishing precedent that trunk highway funds can be broadly used to make the most efficient use of highways to serve the public good, not just move cars. 
This multi-modal vision reflected the era’s transportation reality of the past and today, when Minnesotans rely on a variety of ways of getting around. 
This approach acknowledges that highways aren’t just for cars and trucks — they’re critical corridors connecting people to jobs, education, health care and each other through whatever transportation options best meet their needs and circumstances. We should invest in these roads with the same logic in mind. 
Minnesota’s transportation future requires both vision and pragmatism. By defining highway purpose to include all users, we can build a system that better serves our communities, uses taxpayer dollars more efficiently, and honors the original constitutional intent. 
It’s time to resolve this issue and fund a truly multimodal transportation system for all Minnesotans.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_4760-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-15 07:05:32.305057

The Women, Infants and Children Program, known as WIC, for years required participants to physically visit an office to have their benefits loaded onto their cards — a requirement that sometimes hindered eligible Missourians from getting the food benefits at all.
But as of this month, the Department of Health and Senior Services has completed updates to allow participants to receive benefits remotely — transitioning to a system that has long been operated in nearly every other state. 
WIC is a federal program providing supplemental food, nutrition education and referrals to health care to low-income pregnant, breastfeeding and postpartum women, infants and children up to age 5 who are determined to be at nutritional risk. 
The new WIC card technology in Missouri in effect as of May 1 “will improve the participants’ benefit issuance and redemption experience,” said Lisa Cox, spokesperson for Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, which operates the program. “So we anticipate that participants may remain enrolled in WIC for a longer time, which could increase participation.”
Missouri’s rate of WIC participation has long been below the national average, though it’s improved in recent years. Some attributed Missouri’s administratively-challenging system to the low rate, especially during COVID, when the state had to continue requiring in-person issuance.
In 2022, only 41% of eligible Missourians were enrolled in WIC, and the national average was 54%. As of April, Cox said, there were 95,401 Missourians participating in WIC. 
As of 2022, Missouri was one of just nine states which used a WIC system that required participants to bring their benefits cards to the local agency office when loading benefits — what’s called  an “offline” system for reloading benefits.
Participants on the offline system dealt with transportation and socioeconomic barriers to accessing in-person benefits.

“I have to request off work just to come load the card,” one mother told The Independent.
The modernization effort in effect this month allows the state to operate an “online” system capable of remotely and automatically reloading benefits.
Cox previously said the reason Missouri elected to operate an offline system was based on an analysis conducted roughly a decade ago.
In 2020, “it became apparent that an online system would be more user friendly,” Cox previously said, but “Missouri WIC was unable to change that decision mid-implementation.”
There are other advantages to the modernization, Cox said in a press release, designed to make it easier for participants to track their benefits and for retailers to receive their reimbursement.

New citizens, pictured in white chairs, received welcome materials complete with little jugs of milk in a nod to the Indianapolis 500 race tradition. (Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle) The federal agency that confers citizenship upon thousands of new Hoosiers annually is pulling back from naturalization ceremonies held in donated venues — to the alarm of volunteers who won’t be allowed inside the “in-house” alternatives to register prospective voters.
The Indianapolis Public Library’s Central Library regularly hosts ceremonies in its expansive auditorium, but after scarcely a month’s notice, its last will be next week.
U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) told library staff that ceremonies “will no longer be held in public places” in an April 17 conversation, library spokeswoman Mary G. Barr relayed. A written notice the next day said the cancellations would take effect May 22 and were “due to a decision by (Department of Homeland Security)/USCIS leadership.” 
Under President Donald Trump, USCIS has stopped coordinating ceremonies in so-called sanctuary cities that limit local law enforcement cooperation with federal immigration authorities. But a spokesperson confirmed that this shift is not related.
Instead, the agency hopes to “maximize use of resources.”
The nitty-gritty of naturalization
Naturalization candidates can take their Oath of Allegiance at one of two event types.
Two federal courts, operating throughout Indiana’s northern and southern districts, hold judicial naturalization ceremonies about twice monthly.
“The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana annually provides USCIS with the list of ceremonies we will conduct for the next calendar year along with the number of citizens we can accommodate at each one,” Public Information Officer Doria Lynch wrote. “The Chief Judge then issues an order authorizing USCIS to administer the oath to any citizens above that number.”

USCIS representatives can also offer the oath at administrative naturalization ceremonies held either at agency facilities or donated venues.
The agency’s manual lays out detailed requirements for what materials USCIS can distribute, as well as the ceremony check-in process, program, guest speakers, participation by elected officials, post-ceremony voter registration and more. It also governs how USCIS should coordinate with external organizations and vet facility donation offers.
“Conducting administrative ceremonies in-house saves the agency resources by reducing the staff and supervisor time needed to coordinate logistics with the outside venue, conducting pre-ceremony meetings or walkthroughs, day of setup and breakdown, as well the time involved in conducting ethics reviews of proposed guest speakers and facilities donated to the government,” a spokesperson wrote.
“Indiana locations are not considered ineligible to host ceremonies,” another response read. “USCIS will simply focus resources on in-house administrative ceremonies, rather than external.”
Focus shifts to field office
In contrast to the Indianapolis Public Library, other organizations that regularly donate venues signaled they were unaware of the changes. When asked if it had notified such groups, USCIS didn’t answer.
The Indianapolis Motor Speedway, which has annually hosted ceremonies for four years now, held its latest one Tuesday. Spokeswoman Amanda Stanley wrote that the Brickyard “ha(s)n’t heard anything from USCIS.” While the venue’s 2026 schedule hasn’t been set, it “would be happy” to host again, she added.
The Benjamin Harrison Presidential Site’s July ceremony is still a go, spokeswoman Angela Tuell wrote, although the details are still being finalized. She didn’t address the fate of future ceremonies.
It’s unclear if USCIS’ withdrawal will impact ceremony capacity — or require the Indianapolis Field Office, where the agency already naturalizes candidates, to pick up the new slack.

It’s the only such location in Indiana, according to the USCIS office locator. The locator directs Region residents to the Chicago Field Office, but doesn’t suggest locations in Cincinnati or Louisville to other border-dwellers.
The Indianapolis Field Office, like other locations, “routinely conduct(s) administrative ceremonies in field offices, at regular intervals, as frequently as is necessary,” the spokesperson wrote.
The Southern District has the capacity to offer additional ceremonies and has already scheduled some smaller ones on an as-needed basis, per Lynch. But, she wrote, “It is up to USCIS to notify us if they require additional judicial assistance.”
She and Northern District Court Clerk Chanda J. Berta indicated they’re not expecting changes to judicial naturalization ceremonies. But changes to the administrative variants could impede efforts to get Indiana’s newest citizens registered to vote. 
Post-ceremony sign-ups no more
Barbara Tully is among the small group of dedicated League of Women Voters’ Indianapolis chapter members who volunteer to sign new citizens up after ceremonies conclude. They registered more than 2,500 naturalized citizens on-site last year, and have already tallied upward of 900 this year, she said.
That’s likely coming to an end.
  Barbara Tully testifies in committee on Wednesday, March 5, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
Asked if USCIS would invite organizations offering on-site voter registration services to ceremonies at the Indianapolis Field Office’s 10th-floor space in the Landmark Center downtown, a spokesperson wrote: “No. New U.S. citizens are provided with general information on how to seek services, including registering to vote.”
Tully said the league floated a variety of set-up possibilities but got no traction.
“We tried to see if we could come to their office,” Tully recounted. “… It could just be two league people. It doesn’t have to be like the seven or eight — or however many of us — here to register new citizens. And she said, ‘Well, we really don’t have the space for that.'”
Setting up in the building’s lobby or parking lot, meanwhile could get in the way of other tenants.
“We can’t impede traffic in the parking lot, No. 1. We could be asked to leave because it’s private property. We might have to be on the sidewalk. The weather would have to be good,” Tully listed. “I mean, there’s a lot of hurdles to just standing outside that stupid office building.”
She noted that the changes come as Indiana leaders ramp up scrutiny of citizenship in voting.
Legislation requiring proof of citizenship for those who used temporary forms of identification while registering to vote goes into effect soon — potentially entrapping recently naturalized citizens. The league has encouraged those Hoosiers to present their citizenship certificates to their county voter registration offices after July 1, but is also among groups weighing legal action.
“It’s not right,” Tully said. “You know, they’ve done what they needed to do to become citizens. They’ve gone through all the hurdles, they’ve paid the money, they’ve taken the test, they’ve shown all the documentation that they need to show.”

The Vorsteveld Farm is seeking to add 580 cows, reigniting existing concerns about Lake Champlain’s degrading water quality.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont Supreme Court holds Vorsteveld farm in contempt, clouding farm’s expansion bid.","This exhibit presented by the Hoppers’ attorneys shows runoff in Lake Champlain near the Hopper and Vorsteveld properties. Photo courtesy of Addison County Superior CourtThe Vermont Supreme Court last week found the owners of a Panton dairy farm in contempt of court for their failure to reduce agricultural runoff produced by their large operation. The latest decision in a long-running legal case could further mire the farm’s application for state approval of its plan to add 580 cows. The expansion has already prompted concerns from neighbors who complain that the farm is worsening the water quality in nearby Lake Champlain.Owned by Rudy, Hans and Gerard Vorsteveld, the property is recognized as a Large Farm Operation by the state. The farm’s 1,500 mature dairy cows and 1,500 heifers produce 19.87 million gallons of liquid manure annually. The proposed 580 cow expansion would generate an estimated 6.1 million additional gallons of waste each year, according to their permit application.In response to Vorsteveld Farm’s application, 18 concerned Addison County residents urged state leaders to deny the expansion in an April letter to the secretaries of the Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets and the Agency of Natural Resources as well as Gov. Phil Scott. The neighbors cited the farm’s multiple violations, lack of compliance and defiance of court orders.Additionally, a crowd of roughly 60 people gathered at an April 3 public meeting held by the Agency of Agriculture to discuss the farm’s expansion plans. After a five-day public comment period following the meeting, the agency began reviewing the farm’s expansion application and plans to approve or deny it June 16.In response to neighbors’ claims, Gerard Vorsteveld has said the farm would gradually increase the herd, rather than adding all 580 cows at once. He acknowledged public concern and said he and his brothers were following orders from the state regarding the farm, according to Seven Days.Neither the Vorstevelds’ attorney, Claudine Safar, nor Gerard Vorsteveld returned multiple requests for comment.READ MORE
A history of conflictThe brothers have already been accused of releasing pollution into local waterways, including Lake Champlain — one of Vermont’s primary drinking water sources.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency filed a civil suit against the Vorstevelds last summer for allegedly violating the Clean Water Act and destroying wetlands. The brothers denied the charges, and the case remains open.In 2022, Addison Superior Court Judge Mary Miles Teachout found the Vorstevelds liable for trespass due to polluted runoff crossing a neighbor’s land and flowing into Lake Champlain. The contaminants included nitrates, phosphorus, suspended solids and E. coli levels comparable to untreated sewage, according to the court decision. Though the court ordered the farm to stop the runoff in 2022, the Vorstevelds were held in contempt in September 2024 for failing to comply. Teachout ordered they pay a $1,000 fine for each day the farm was out of compliance, starting Nov. 15, 2024. The Vorstevelds, through their attorney, appealed the decision and invested an estimated $60,000 in improvements to their tile drainage system to prove their compliance with court orders.“The Farm did its best to address the issues that were raised by every point, and spent a significant amount of time and money addressing these issues,” Safar said in an argument before the Vermont Supreme Court. In rebuttal, the Hoppers’ attorney Merrill Bent argued much of the $60,000 the Vorstevelds spent on improvements was geared toward the EPA’s lawsuit against the farm, rather than in response to Teachout’s contempt order. Bent said “there is a robust record” of evidence validating Teachout’s motion for contempt.At evidentiary hearings on April 24 and 25, Gerard Vorsteveld testified that he had capped the tile drains, successfully preventing water from flowing into neighbors’ property. Although the excess runoff was halted temporarily, the court found that Vorsteveld’s solution did not meet the clear and convincing standard to prove permanent compliance with the initial contempt order, according to Teachout’s May 1 Superior Court decision.To conclude the three-year legal battle, a final Supreme Court decision on May 9 upheld the lower court’s contempt order. However, Teachout relieved the Vorstevelds of any fines due to their attempt to comply during the period between Nov. 16, 2024, through April 25, 2025.Community complaintsIn their letter to state agencies and the governor, neighbors pointed to the contempt ruling as evidence that Vorsteveld Farm has not addressed the continued harm to Vermont’s waterways, therefore, “the question the Secretary of Agriculture must determine when evaluating an LFO Amendment application has already been conclusively determined.”Neighbor Glen Macri pointed to the EPA’s separate lawsuit accusing the Vorstevelds of illegally discharging pollution into wetlands, calling it a clear contradiction against the farm’s ecological practices such as cover-cropping and no-till farming.“They are trying to maximize yields, but there’s no countermeasure to control the accelerated runoff that’s going directly to the lake or surrounding waterways,” Macri said. “I guess there’s no regulation or requirement to prevent that.”He said the farm is situated in an environmentally sensitive area with the Dead Creek watershed to the east and Lake Champlain directly to the west, both of which provide popular public recreational sites. Paulette Brogan, another neighbor and longtime Addison County resident, said algae blooms near her Lake Champlain property have rapidly increased since the Vorstevelds built their tile drainage system, which she believes to be the cause of the pollution.“We have a dock … I used to swim in it, and I would not swim in it anymore. It’s directly a result of the algae blooms,” she said. In an email to VTDigger, Safar wrote that these claims from neighbors were “completely baseless.”The state’s roleThe proposed farm expansion accompanies ongoing criticism of Vermont’s regulatory system, which divides oversight between the Agency of Agriculture and the Agency of Natural Resources. Macri voiced frustration with what he called a “totally dysfunctional” arrangement between the agencies. Under the existing system, the agriculture agency oversees farm practices to prevent runoff, while the Agency of Natural Resources is tasked with intervening if that pollution reaches streams or lakes. However, neighbors say the split regulatory system has led to finger-pointing rather than action. Brogan said her questions about water quality have gone unanswered by the state. “Every time we ask (the agriculture agency) to look into the water quality,” their response is to put the responsibility on the Agency of Natural Resources, even though “the agriculture agency has 12 water specialists on their staff,” she said.Scott Waterman, a spokesperson for the Agency of Agriculture, said in an email that officials were unavailable for comment while the Vorsteveld farm’s expansion application remains under review until June.The EPA has acknowledged deficiencies in Vermont’s regulatory programs for more than a decade. In a January letter to Natural Resources Secretary Julie Moore, the federal agency said the state’s division of responsibilities between her agency and the Agency of Agriculture “has led to confusion and regulatory inaction.” The EPA has pushed Vermont to clearly define the two agencies’ roles, particularly for regulating concentrated animal feeding operations, which have never been formally permitted in the state. The pollution generated from phosphorus, often present in agricultural runoff, is arguably the greatest threat to clean water in Lake Champlain, according to the Department of Environmental Conservation.In response to the EPA’s concerns, legislators are considering bill S.124, which would give oversight of the concentrated animal feeding operations program to the Agency of Natural Resources, though many responsibilities would still be shared with the Agency of Agriculture. Moore said the bill received broad support from the EPA.“There were places where we hadn’t kept up with some of the changes in the Federal Code of Regulations around CAFO,” Moore said. “We’ve committed to EPA that we will revise that to provide better clarity around roles and responsibilities, and that the authority for the CAFO program really sits with ANR.”The agriculture agency is responsible for approving or denying the Vorsteveld’s proposed expansion, and its review of their permit application is expected to occur “outside of any real conversation about the CAFO program,” Moore said.Brogan, one of the neighbors, expressed disbelief that the farm’s expansion is even on the table, due to the drastic reforms needed in Vermont’s regulatory system. “Since we’ve got this dysfunctional relationship between ANR and the agency of ag, and we have no permit for CAFOs in Vermont, and we’re in violation of the Clean Water Act, how can they possibly consider an expansion of the farm?” she said. Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont Supreme Court holds Vorsteveld farm in contempt, clouding farm’s expansion bid.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Vorsteveld-trial-13-scaled.jpg,,,2025-05-15 07:05:32.305057

Bonamo,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/05/15/meet-the-powerful-brother-of-newarks-mayor/,Newark Mayor Ras Baraka's brother Amiri has been by his brother’s side as Ras Baraka rose from community activist to councilman to mayor to potential governor.,"Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, left, is running to become New Jersey's next governor. His brother Amiri, known as Middy, is his chief of staff in Newark. As Newark Mayor Ras Baraka campaigns to become New Jersey’s next governor, his professional, political, and personal relationship with his brother and chief of staff could provide a glimpse of a future Baraka administration. 
Amiri “Middy” Baraka Jr., who has been by his brother’s side as Ras Baraka rose from community activist to councilman to mayor to potential governor, is a controversial figure in the state’s largest city, someone whose supporters say is tough because he has to be — but whose critics liken to a lawbreaker.
Rahaman Muhammad, Newark’s deputy mayor of employment, called Middy Baraka “underestimated.”
“I think he’s one of the best campaign operators around. People misinterpret the things that he does. He’s just a strong personality,” Muhammad said. “In this business, you’ve got to be tough. If you ain’t tough, you’re on the menu.”
Alif Muhammad, a former Newark Housing Authority commissioner who sued Ras and Middy Baraka over claims of intimidation and retaliation, called the two brothers “inseparable.”
“Ras is great when you put a mic in front of him and the lights are on, but he’s an introvert. Middy is the extrovert. Ras needs him when he goes out to get the troops together. Then, Middy takes his chances. Ras can’t function without him,” Alif Muhammad said. 
If Ras Baraka ends up winning the Democratic nod for governor on June 10 and then wins the November general election, it is expected Middy Baraka will play some role in a Baraka administration, officially or unofficially.
Ras Baraka appointed his brother as his chief of staff the day he became Newark’s mayor in 2014.
“I’ve got my brother’s back, 120 percent,” Middy Baraka said in an interview shortly after that election.
Since then, Middy Baraka has boosted his brother’s electoral chances via his political consulting firm, Bottom Up Consulting, a mainstay of Newark’s political scene.
Middy Baraka took credit for the Baraka team’s role in the local get-out-the-vote effort in the Democratic primary in 2017, the first step for Gov. Phil Murphy before winning his first term. Murphy won that year’s primary with 48% of the vote; in Newark, he won 73%.
“The mayor is the king of the city,” Middy Baraka said then. “And this time, our operation was fully prepared. We did our regular drill.”
 Amiri “Middy” Baraka Jr. has been the chief of staff in Newark ever since his brother Ras became mayor in 2014.
‘He fights in the streets’
New campaign filings for Ras Baraka’s bid to become governor show it paid his brother’s firm more than half a million dollars this year alone.
Bottom Up received about $529,200 for consulting work in 2025 and $46,000 last year for get-out-the-vote efforts, campaign filings show. The Baraka campaign has spent $4.8 million total as of May 9.
Bottom Up also worked for Ras Baraka’s mayoral campaign, which paid the firm more than $77,000 for get-out-the-vote efforts during the mayor’s 2022 reelection campaign. Voter turnout in that election was anemic, with just 17,784 ballots cast out of 160,298 registered voters, an 11% turnout rate, according to the Essex County Clerk’s Office.
Ras Baraka’s campaign declined to comment for this story. But he defended his brother’s work for his campaigns at a recent candidate forum in Maplewood.
“My brother has a firm where he hires people to work on campaigns. Obviously, that’s going to happen. He’s going to continue to do that,” Baraka said. “He’s my brother. I trust him. He’s loyal. He fights in the street. He’s going to continue to do that.”










In this business, you’ve got to be tough. If you ain’t tough, you’re on the menu.


– Rahaman Muhammad, Newark’s deputy mayor of employment


In an emailed statement, Middy Baraka questioned the merits of this story.
“I do hope your story also takes a broad view and examines how many senior government officials across the state are similarly involved in campaign efforts — hard side as well as dark money political PACs. That kind of context is essential if we’re truly trying to understand the landscape, rather than singling out a Black politician,” he said.
It’s true that Middy Baraka is not the only government official who is also on the campaign trail for one of the gubernatorial hopefuls — South Orange Mayor Sheena Collum is campaigning for one of Ras Baraka’s Democratic rivals, Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop. He’s also not the only relative getting paid by one of the campaigns (Republican Jack Ciattarelli’s daughter is a paid staff member on her father’s campaign). And Ras Baraka’s rivals for the Democratic nomination for governor also pay consultants, though the Baraka campaign’s payments to Bottom Up are the highest by far.
Recent campaign filings show Rep. Josh Gottheimer spent $304,000 on political consultants this year, while Rep. Mikie Sherrill spent $214,640 on political, fundraising, media, and polling consultants. Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop’s campaign shelled out just $3,000 for political consulting, his campaign filings show.
Ras Baraka’s campaign spent an additional $83,129 on political consulting this year, on top of the roughly $529,200 it paid Bottom Up.

City Hall
Middi Baraka’s 11-year tenure as Newark’s chief of staff has not been without controversy.
Alif Muhammad, the former Newark housing commissioner, alleged in a May 2022 lawsuit filed in state Superior Court that Middy Baraka approached him to change his vote on a resolution involving a landscaping contract.
Muhammad’s lawsuit recounts a conversation he had with Middy Baraka about his vote.
“I don’t want to do it,” Muhammad alleged he told Baraka. “All I have is my integrity.”
“Integrity is about us,” he said Baraka told him. “This is politics and this is the world you’re in. When somebody else disrespects me it’s going to be a problem.”
Muhammad also claims Middy Baraka told him, “At the end of the day, I protect my brother, that’s all I do,” and that Middy Baraka griped that pay-to-play laws made it so that “we can’t make no money in this town.”
A judge dismissed the case in October 2022.
Five years prior, in June 2017, Middy Baraka was a defendant in a federal whistleblower lawsuit filed by former Newark city attorney Willie Parker and centered around a development deal Newark was negotiating. 
Parker alleges Middy Baraka “commanded” Parker to execute a contract on behalf of the city that Parker disapproved of, confronted Parker outside his home escorted by Middy Baraka’s “fully armed” security patrol, and accused Parker of snitching on him to Ras Baraka.
The two sides settled soon before Ras and Middy Baraka were scheduled to be deposed in the case. Newark paid Parker a $300,000 settlement.
Alif Muhammad believes Middy Baraka’s alleged behavior has not served his brother well in more ways than one. 
“The attitude, the intimidation – Middy has hurt Ras in Newark. He has a thing about absolute power, and so you make a lot of enemies,” Muhammad said. “But if you’re trying to go to Trenton, it’s a bigger spectrum and you have to be more sophisticated. I ride around town and I see Middy putting up posters in Newark, and I think, ‘Does he know where Monmouth County is?'”
‘Money above merits’?
If Baraka ends up in the governor’s mansion, his brother would likely not land on the governor’s payroll.
State law bars relatives of the governor from taking certain positions in the executive branch. But Dan Cassino, a professor of government and politics at Fairleigh Dickinson University and director of the school’s poll, said Middy Baraka could still have significant influence in a Ras Baraka administration.
“There’s no requirement that your top advisor has to be on the state payroll. It’s certainly possible to have outside advisors. It’s a long tradition we call “kitchen cabinets,” the idea that you bring in people from the outside who are actually your closest advisors and are not necessarily paid or on the state payroll,” Cassino said. “In fact, it gives people a lot more flexibility, and also means that a lot of their communications wouldn’t be subject to FOIA laws, for instance.” 
Craig Holman of the Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit consumer advocacy organization Public Citizen, whose work focuses on governmental ethics and campaign finance, said it should raise voters’ eyebrows that Ras Baraka gave his brother such a high-profile public job.
“This is the type of relationship that contributes to the public’s general distrust of politicians. It’s a situation in which essentially nepotistic relationships are built for for-profit purposes,” Holman said. “It places money above merits.”
The Rev. Ronald Slaughter, pastor of St. James AME Church in Newark, said the mayor’s brother might have a political future of his own in Newark. The city’s next mayoral election is in 2026.
“It could be that the chief of staff runs for mayor himself,” Slaughter said. “I don’t think he ever personally looked for what he himself could become in terms of politics. And if his brother is elected governor, that may be a wonderful time for him to look.” 
Parker, the former Newark attorney who sued the city in 2017, said if Ras Baraka makes it to Trenton, he expects Middy to go with him.
“Whatever it is in Newark, it would be on the state level,” Parker said. “It would only be amplified.”

(Susan Demas | Michigan Advance)Over two days of hearings this week, members of the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, environmental advocates and experts testified against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers granting a permit to reroute Enbridge’s Line 5 oil and natural gas pipeline in northern Wisconsin. 
The tribe’s testimony was one of its last chances to prevent the new pipeline from being installed upstream of its reservation — which the tribe says will harm water quality in the watershed, encourage the growth of invasive species and damage wetlands, diminishing the ability to filter pollutants out of runoff before reaching surface waters. 
Enbridge insists the reroute plans do everything possible to minimize the environmental effect of pipeline construction and operation while industry groups and labor unions say the project has been vetted to ensure it isn’t harmful and that the arguments against the environmental effects of construction could be used to slow down any project in the state, not just those the tribe disagrees with politically.

Last year, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources issued its own permits for the company to build the pipeline with more than 200 added conditions to ensure compliance with state standards. Months after the DNR’s permit decision, a separate pipeline operated by Enbridge in Wisconsin spilled 69,000 gallons of crude oil in Jefferson County. 
The tribe is also challenging the DNR’s permit determination in a series of hearings later this summer. 
For decades, Line 5 ran through the tribe’s reservation and in 2023 a federal judge ordered that it be shut down. Since 2020, Enbridge has been working on a plan to reroute the pipeline, which runs from far northwest Wisconsin 645 miles into Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, under the Straits of Mackinac and across the U.S. border into Canada near Detroit. It transports about 23 million gallons of crude oil and natural gas liquids daily.
At the hearings this week, the tribe argued that under the Clean Water Act, the Corps shouldn’t grant the permits because the tribe has determined the new pipeline will negatively affect its water quality. 
Tribal chairman makes the case against Line 5
“Our people have resided in the Bad River watershed for hundreds of years,” Robert Blanchard, the tribe’s chairman, said Tuesday. “It’s our homeland. If the U.S. Army Corps grants these permits, Enbridge is undoubtedly going to destroy and pollute our watershed by trenching, blasting and horizontal drilling across hundreds of upstream wetlands and streams. I’m asking the U.S. Army Corps to think of the people and all the living things this will affect, and to deny the permit for this project.”
During Tuesday’s testimony, Blanchard added, “When I look at my homelands, I see it through the eyes of my grandfather, who saw it through the eyes of his grandfather.” 
Blanchard said he wants his grandchildren to be able to see their homelands through his eyes, too. He recounted boating up the Bad River toward Lake Superior as a boy, catching fish with his elders to eat or to sell at the market. His grandfather taught him to hunt and gather and to this day Blanchard gathers medicinal herbs which are used by his community, he said. He remembers the lumber companies that clear cut the forests, and, he said, some of his loved ones have died of cancer after living near an industrial dump site. 
“That was all in the Bad River watershed,” said Blanchard. He stressed that in tribal tradition, all things in nature have spirit, including the water. To the Bad River Band, nature is not only critical to human survival, it is a sacred thing to be protected.

In their testimony Tuesday, Enbridge consultants and researchers downplayed concerns about how the pipeline reroute could harm local ecosystems. Just over 118 acres of forest will need to be cleared during construction and turned into a managed grassland. Experts testifying for the company said that the underground pipeline will not act as an underwater dam and disrupt groundwater flow, nor will the explosives used to blast trenches for the pipeline present a danger. Other concerns such as radioactive contamination, PFAS pollution (often called forever chemicals) and arsenic are not used by the project, and have not been detected in the area. 
Although Enbridge’s consultants and experts argued that the project would not violate the Bad River Band’s water quality standards, the Band itself disagreed, citing concerns about pollutants, water quantity and quality, hydrology, mineral content and water temperature. 
Connie Sue Martin, and environmental attorney who testified against the project said the Bad River Band “is the expert” on water quality in the area, not U.S. government agencies including the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
Esteban Chiriboga, a geologist with the Great Lakes Indian Fish and Wildlife Commission, testified that the rerouted pipeline’s distance from the reservation is irrelevant because contaminants can travel. Using imagery from Laser Imaging, Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) technology, Chiriboga demonstrated that waterways and flow channels between rivers, creeks and wetlands are interconnected. Others who spoke against the project on Tuesday expressed concerns about the potential for increased runoff, soil erosion, and the spread of invasive species as consequences of the project.

On Wednesday, much of the tribe’s testimony centered around the ways in which the tribe’s members rely on the Bad River and its tributaries. 
“You will not find another community so dependent upon subsistence harvesting and dependent upon the health of our environment,” said Dylan Jennings, a member of the tribe and former appointee of Gov. Tony Evers to the state Natural Resources Board. “Simply put, our community maintains a relationship with the entire ecosystem and not a segmented area, we continue to utilize an entire system approach which naturally extends beyond our reservation boundaries.” 
Union members testify in favor of Line 5
During the public comment period of the hearing Wednesday, a number of labor union representatives defended the project as a source of local jobs and environmentally safe. Chad Ward, a representative of the Teamsters Local 346, said members of his union will work on the project and live locally, so they take “very seriously our commitment to the community and the environment around the construction site.” But, he said, the tribe’s complaints could be made about any construction project in the area. 
“I and others have grave concerns that the assertions made by the tribe could have impacts well beyond the Line 5 project itself,” Ward said. “Construction practices considered industry and regulatory best practices for environmental protection are cited as reasons by the tribe for why this project should not proceed, practices that are standard use all over the country” 
“They are practices the Band has been fine with for dozens of projects in the same area,” he continued. “This leaves the impression that these concerns are more based on the political views of the project than the construction method themselves. And while they’re entitled to their political views, it is the job of the permitting process to determine if the laws and regulations are being followed, not weigh the political arguments.” 
After Wednesday, the Army Corps will accept written comments on the permit approval for 30 days and then can make a decision any time after that. The hearings on the legal challenge to the DNR permits begin Aug. 12 in Ashland.

The purpose of the committee is to undertake a study of state and local land use regulations and how they impact the housing supply.
In addition to the study, the committee can make recommendations to the Idaho Legislature during the 2026 legislative session.
  Residents ‘can’t afford a house in our community,’ Star mayor says 

Committee members did not make any recommendations on Wednesday.
Instead, members received briefings on affordable housing issues in the Gem State.
The committee identified some of the barriers and problems, including high costs of mortgages and rent, a low inventory of housing that doesn’t meet demand, vacation homes and short-term rentals, infrastructure needs like water and sewer, emergency services and more.

	 Committee may discuss economic incentives, zoning changes or streamlining permits as potential solutions to Idaho’s housing affordability crisis [/subhed]
Without affordable housing available, more Idahoans are living on public lands, living in unsafe spaces that aren’t designed to be homes or moving elsewhere, housing and development experts told the committee Wednesday.
Without getting into specific proposals, committee members began discussing potential solutions to discuss at future meetings, including economic and tax incentives, streamlining approval and permitting processes, zoning or density changes, infrastructure upgrades and the potential use of a local option tax or resort tax to incentivize housing construction. 
After adjourning Wednesday, the housing study committee plans to meet three more times around the state before the 2026 legislative session begins in January. 
Future meeting dates include June 27 in Idaho Falls, Aug. 14 in Sandpoint and Sept. 26 in Boise.

Indiana government has a new digital front door with the redesigned IN.gov website. The homepage now features an AI chatbot, “Ask Indiana,” where residents can ask questions and get real-time answers 24/7. 
Want to know when the Bureau of Motor Vehicles is open? “Ask Indiana” has the answer: 
“Indiana BMV branch hours can vary by location, but most branches are open Tuesday through Saturday. Many branches are closed on Sundays and Mondays. Typical hours are:

Tuesday: 9:00 AM – 6:30 PM
Wednesday–Friday: 9:00 AM – 5:00 PM
Saturday: 9:00 AM – 12:30 PM”

The Indiana Office of Technology launched the redesign last week as part of an ongoing web maintenance contract with Tyler Technologies, a software and services company assisting government and schools. 
Indiana Office of Technology Director of Communications and External Affairs Graig Lubsen said the agency began the redesign in December and included the new features after obtaining user input through a survey. The redesign also features additional accessibility settings such as light/dark themes and font size adjustments to make the website more user friendly. 
Lubsen said “Ask Indiana” was created to modernize how residents can interact with state services. It uses generative AI and natural language processing to break down government agency “silos” and respond in real time.  Its the latest foray of state government into the world of AI.
The state entered into a four-year, $22 million contract with Tyler Indiana in October 2024. Tyler provides services to maintain and operate the state web portal. According to Lubsen one of its many deliverables in the contract was to focus on redesigning the homepage and agency templates every other year.
“Ask Indiana” can be found in the top right corner of the IN.gov homepage. 
When opening the chatbot, users can find the seven point terms and conditions. Here it includes that the AI Resident Assistant may not always be correct or up to date, and it may limit the service’s ability to respond to particular requests such as personal information or sensitive topics or current events. 
The chat often includes links to state webpages with more information. 



We asked the chatbot a few questions, and even stumped it once:
What is the most unique thing about Indiana? 
“Indiana is unique for several reasons, but one of the most distinctive features is its nickname, “The Crossroads of America.” Indiana has more miles of interstate highway per square mile than any other state, making it a major hub for transportation and commerce. This is reflected in the state motto, adopted in 1937, and highlights Indiana’s central role in connecting different parts of the country.”
How can I get an Indiana drivers license?
“To get an Indiana driver’s license, follow these steps:

Obtain a Learner’s Permit (if required):
You must be at least 15 years old and enrolled in a driver education program, or 16 years old without driver education.
Pass a vision screening and a knowledge exam.
Provide documents proving your identity, Social Security number, lawful status, and Indiana residency.
Complete Supervised Driving (if under 18):
Hold your learner’s permit for at least 180 days.
Complete 50 hours of supervised driving (10 hours at night).
Apply for a Driver’s License:
If under 21, you’ll receive a probationary license.
Pass a driving skills test.
Provide required documents and, if under 18, a parent or guardian must sign a financial liability agreement.
For New Indiana Residents:
You have 60 days to obtain an Indiana license after moving.
Surrender your out-of-state license and provide required documents.
Pass a vision screening (and possibly a knowledge/driving test if your license is expired).
Visit a BMV Branch
Bring all required documents and complete the application process in person.

What is Indiana’s Black history? 
Indiana’s Black history is rich and complex, beginning in the 1700s and continuing through today. Here are some key highlights:

Early Settlement and Slavery: The first record of African Americans in Indiana dates to 1746, when enslaved people lived in Vincennes. Although the 1787 Northwest Ordinance banned slavery, some early settlers brought enslaved people with them. Indiana’s 1816 Constitution officially prohibited slavery, but Black residents still faced many restrictions and discrimination.
Black Communities: By the mid-1800s, more than 30 Black farming communities were established, especially in central and southern Indiana. Notable settlements include Lyles Station (Gibson County), Beech (Rush County), and Roberts Settlement (Hamilton County). Many of these communities built their own schools, churches, and social organizations.
Legal Barriers: The 1851 Indiana Constitution included Article XIII, which barred new Black residents from settling in the state. Black Hoosiers were also denied voting rights, could not serve in the militia, and faced other legal restrictions.
Civil Rights and Achievements: Despite challenges, Black Hoosiers made significant contributions. James Sidney Hinton became the first African American to serve in the Indiana State Legislature. The 28th Regiment United States Colored Troops, organized in Indiana, fought in the Civil War.
Cultural Impact: Indiana Avenue in Indianapolis became a center for Black culture, music, and business in the 20th century. Madam C.J. Walker, a famous entrepreneur, established her business headquarters there.
Modern Recognition: Today, Indiana celebrates Black History Month and works to preserve historic Black sites and cemeteries. Organizations and museums highlight the achievements and struggles of Black Hoosiers.

How much does Indiana spend on medicaid?
As of May 2024, Indiana’s Medicaid expenditures for the current state fiscal year (July 1, 2023 – June 30, 2024) total approximately $18.16 billion. Of this amount, about 71% comes from federal funds, and around 21% is funded by the state’s general fund. The remainder is covered by intergovernmental transfers, provider taxes, and other sources.
For the previous fiscal year (2023), Indiana’s total Medicaid spending was about $17.9 billion.
These figures include all Medicaid programs and services provided to eligible Indiana residents.
For more detailed and updated financial reports, you can visit the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration’s Medicaid financial reports page.
What does Indiana spend the most money on? 
Indiana spends the most money on education. According to the State of Indiana’s 2024 Financial Report and the official state budget, education is the largest category of state spending. This includes funding for K-12 schools, higher education (colleges and universities), and related educational programs.
Here’s a breakdown of Indiana’s major spending categories for Fiscal Year 2024:

Education: Over $13 billion (largest single category)
Health & Welfare: Includes Medicaid, public health, and social services, totaling over $7 billion
Public Safety & Transportation: Includes corrections, state police, and the Department of Transportation
General Administration: Covers the operation of state government agencies
Other: Includes natural resources, environmental management, and state parks

Education consistently receives the highest portion of Indiana’s budget, reflecting the state’s commitment to funding schools and universities.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-14-at-1.21.29 PM-scaled-e1747244931676-1024x492.jpeg,,,2025-05-15 07:05:32.305057
,WyoFile,2025-05-15 10:25:00+00:00,WyoFile,"How a Wyoming town agreed it needed a charter school, but ended up fiercely divided",Katie Klingsporn,,,,,https://wyofile.com/how-a-wyoming-town-agreed-it-needed-a-charter-school-but-ended-up-fiercely-divided/,"

Alpine “desperately” needs a school. But when a charter school got approved, it ignited a polarizing community debate that roiled the small town. 
The post How a Wyoming town agreed it needed a charter school, but ended up fiercely divided appeared first on WyoFile .","ALPINE—Nothing stirred on this residential corner of spread-out homes, though the school bus was due in just 10 minutes. The sun had yet to peak over the hulking mountains east of town, and a lone robin chirruped across the cold blueish pre-dawn light.
Six minutes later, at 6:51 a.m., a group of children marched into view and toward the bus stop.
A minivan soon pulled up and idled. Behind the wheel was a woman named Irena, who was dropping off her first-grade daughter and didn’t give her last name in the morning rush. Irena, like many residents of this small bedroom community, commutes to work in Jackson, she said. Most Alpine school kids like her daughter, meanwhile, attend Lincoln County schools, which means they ride buses taking them in the opposite direction.
The disconnect has long been a source of frustration for families in this community, where many parents spend their days working in a town one to two hours’ drive away from where their children are educated.
Then relief appeared on the horizon when longstanding efforts to raise up a school in Alpine finally got traction last fall. Wyoming’s new state authorizing board approved a charter application for a town residents agree is in “desperate” need of its own education facility. The early process was defined by overwhelming support for a school, and a charter group chose American Preparatory Academy out of Utah to operate it.
But fast-forward several months, and the charter school proposal has deeply divided the community. Outcry over APA’s conservative values and history of lawsuits fueled months of debate before the Alpine Town Council stipulated the charter board select a new provider. Adding to the tension, landowners of a nearby airpark are leery about a school location that might sit in their flight path. Questions about precise school enrollment estimates, employment structure and the makeup of the school’s governing board remain unanswered as the town considers leasing its land to the school.
School proponents, meanwhile, say they need the town’s stamp of approval before they can nail down details — underscoring a chicken-and-egg conundrum that has swirled around the charter school proposal since its inception.

It’s a story shaped by factors that include rural challenges and the high cost of living in resort towns. It’s also one that could offer a cautionary tale of the stumbling blocks and lengthy process proponents might face as they work to open more charter schools in a state that is becoming friendlier to school choice.  
In Alpine, the charter school proposal also has become a painful reminder of deep disagreements over how the town can best shape its future. 
“It’s gutted us,” said Shay Scaffide, a real estate agent and mother who was motivated to run for town council by her interest in the school. She was elected in November. 
Back at the bus stop, Irena, who has two younger children not yet in school, said she and her husband sincerely hope they can enroll their kids in an Alpine school someday soon. They don’t want to spend their daily lives in such a scattered arrangement, she said. They support the charter school. 
Moments later, a Lincoln County School District 2 bus pulled up, the doors opening with a hiss. Irena’s daughter exited the family van and queued up behind the other children. With the riders aboard, the bus driver closed the doors and pulled away from the corner, heading south to Etna, where the girl would transfer to another bus that would ultimately take her to Thayne Elementary School. 
By the map, she’d be 54 miles away from her mother’s work. But to her mom and many others in Alpine, the gulf feels much larger.
A complication of geography 
Alpine butts up against the Idaho border where the Snake River flows into the southern foot of Palisades Reservoir. Along with bordering two bodies of water, the town of 1,220 people is surrounded by mountainous national forest. 
It’s relatively young among Wyoming towns; it wasn’t incorporated until 1988. But it’s grown substantially and has been one of the state’s fastest-growing communities in recent years. 
Lifelong Alpine resident Dave Jenkins was born before it was incorporated. His father started a hardware business in Alpine and was instrumental in forming the fire department, EMS and a local church. The younger Jenkins has watched the community evolve drastically. 
It’s always been a bedroom community for people who work in Jackson, Jenkins said, but he remembers when it was little more than a handful of homes, plus a gas station and bar. Today, the town boasts a grocery store, three banks, a brewery and a medical center. Neighborhoods near the reservoir house families, and residents and visitors can land and stow their aircraft in the Alpine Airpark. It’s plain to Jenkins why more people are moving here. 
“We have three rivers, a beautiful lake, the mountains,” he said. “It’s just an awesome place to live if you like the outdoors.”

Alpine, which sits near the Idaho border on the northern end of Star Valley, was incorporated in 1988. (Katie Klingsporn/WyoFile) 
Alpine also technically sits at the northern tip of Star Valley — a scenic and sparsely populated landscape settled by Mormons in the late 1870s. 
That puts Alpine inside the boundaries of Lincoln County School District 2, which operates schools in Etna, Osmond, Thayne, Afton and farther south in Cokeville. 
As a kid and then a parent in Alpine, Jenkins experienced firsthand the hardships involved with having a school so far from home. Kids leave the house before 7 a.m. and, depending on after-school activities, often don’t return until after dinnertime.
“It’s a long day,” he said. “It’s an hour there, an hour back. Sometimes you get home, and then have to go back again for something else.”
The grueling schedule puts Alpine kids at a disadvantage, he said, especially the youngest students. “Your 5-year-old is changing buses in the middle of the winter, in the dark, in Etna, and then getting on another bus to go on to Thayne.”
He also thinks a school is crucial for Alpine to be a sustainable and well-rounded community. 
“You hear multiple times where people move here, they get kids, the kids get of age and either they move to Afton or Victor/Driggs or somewhere else” that has a school, he said. A school would root people into Alpine, he said.
When Kelly Shackelford moved her family to Alpine to be close to her parents in 2017, the school transition for her children came as a shock. They had previously lived in Cheyenne, where schools were blocks away, she said. 
“I was like, ‘Oh my God, what have I done to my children?’” she remembers. 
As a single mother working in Jackson, the juggling act has been difficult, she said. She remembers the day she got a phone call at work that her daughter was injured playing soccer in Afton. “It took me two and a half hours to get to her … And that’s just not fun for any parent.”
Shackelford and Jenkins were among a group of citizens who joined forces with a common goal for a school. Investor and developer Steven Funk was also heavily involved early in the process. 
Jenkins was so motivated that he ran for the LCSD2 school board. He was elected in 2022 with the express goal of bringing a school to Alpine. But he soon discovered that going through traditional public school channels would take many years.

LCSD2 Superintendent Matt Erickson confirmed that. In Wyoming, schools are built according to a formula of need based on capacity or building condition. Alpine simply doesn’t have the student population to trigger a new building, given that Etna and Thayne elementary schools have sufficient capacity, he said. 
“It’s all about numbers, and we average about 15 students per grade level in the Alpine area,” Erickson said. The population likely will grow to substantiate the creation of a school in the future, but so far, he said, “the numbers just haven’t borne out that they would qualify for a school,” based on the state’s formulas.
Jenkins and others didn’t want to wait years. They began exploring other options. 
School dreams
Alpine resident Eric Green commuted to Jackson five days a week when his children were in LCSD2 schools, and he knows firsthand what a headache it can be. When he was elected Alpine mayor in 2022, one of the first things he did was initiate a conversation with district officials about a school in Alpine. Officials were clear that it would be years before a public school was feasible.
Green also initiated the Alpine Public Education Committee. 
“Since Alpine didn’t have a school, and I think everyone is in agreement that Alpine deserves a school, I thought it was a proper time to put together a group of people to do some research and give us their recommendation on, should we focus on a Lincoln County School District school in Alpine or should we go the charter school route?” Green said. 
The committee looked into the possibility of LCSD2 reconfiguring grades in buildings so that young Alpine students could have a shorter bus ride to Etna for K-6 grades. The district, which had moved to the pod structure of schools — which concentrates kids of the same class together in configurations such as K-3 and 4-6 schools in lieu of K-6 — was reluctant to change back. The committee ultimately decided that the charter option was its best bet for success. Jenkins also came to that conclusion, and a charter school board coalesced. 
A charter school is a tuition-free public school that is run independently. In Wyoming, these were traditionally approved through school districts, like Arapahoe Charter High School on the Wind River Reservation. In 2023, however, the Wyoming Legislature created a state charter authorizing board as another avenue for charters to emerge. That board was empowered to approve three charters, which it did for schools in Cheyenne, Chugwater and Casper. 
By the time school advocates decided to pursue a charter for Alpine, the state board did not have the authority to approve another charter until 2026. The Alpine group hired education consultant Jeff Daugherty to work with lawmakers, and they helped pass legislation that enabled one Western Wyoming charter school to be authorized in 2024, which meant a spot was open for Alpine.

The Alpine group set out to select a school provider. Wyoming doesn’t have any charter providers, so they looked out of state and — with the recommendation of Sen. Ogden Driskill, R-Devils Tower, and support of Sen. Dan Dockstader, R-Afton — settled on American Preparatory Academy out of Utah to move forward with the application. 
APA, which operates nine charter schools in Utah, touts its program as a “classical education charter school focusing on academic rigour and character development.” Its students wear uniforms, learn cursive from a young age and study Latin. It boasts a structured and patriotic environment that pushes kids to want to excel on their own.
The Alpine charter board, joined by APA’s founder, Carolyn Sharette, held public information sessions last summer before undergoing the application process with the state. 
In the end, Alpine won out over another application from Cody.
The authorizing board approved the K-8 school charter in October with several conditions. They included stipulations that the charter board add member who is a K-12 expert; that the head of school report to the school board rather than the APA; and that the local board be the financial decision-maker.
“So we got the charter,” Jenkins said. “We thought that would be the hard part.”
Sentiment splits
Support dominated the tenor of early town meetings on the possibility of a charter school.
Jennifer Wilhite stood at the lectern during a September meeting to explain how, after 27 years, she had sold her home in Jackson and moved her family to Alpine. But getting her kids on a bus at 6:50 a.m. every day “was challenging, to say the least.” So challenging that she went to the trouble to build a house in Etna and move her family again to be close to that school. She still dreams of settling in Alpine. “I am 100% for this charter school,” she said. 
At that same meeting, Alpine resident, parent and elementary school teacher Jen Baki said she sees how the grueling schedule impacts students’ ability to learn, especially the youngest ones. “They come to school so exhausted,” she said.

There were voices of concern about Alpine Preparatory Academy, however, including from members of the mayor’s education committee. Jordan Kurt Mason, a Jackson teacher, warned about “dog whistles to a far-right political stance,” such as an American Preparatory Academy blog post specifying that teaching Critical Race Theory at a K-12 level is indoctrinational. 
Heather Goodrich was another member of the committee. Because she is a teacher in Jackson, Goodrich has been able to enroll and take her children to school in Teton County School District 1. But she wanted Alpine to have a school of its own. She even dreamed of working for it, she said. 
However, she was troubled by the APA’s rhetoric and what she sees as language coded toward far-right and white nationalist views. Soon after the committee began to explore the charter school option, Goodrich said she started feeling like the plan was predetermined, which she didn’t like. 
When she and others tried to explore other charter providers, she said, they were shot down and “gaslit” with the message that APA was the only option. But the more she learned about APA, the more opposed she became. She discovered a host of concerns regarding lawsuits, pedagogy, alleged racism and anti-LGBTQ+ sentiment, she said. 
“It’s very clear that this is a very right-leaning school,” Goodrich said. 
In Alpine, criticism began to grow louder. Meetings grew more contentious, with accusations flying about conflicts of interest and complaints that the state’s and town’s school conditions weren’t being met. Both sides felt attacked.
“It just feels like this snowball,” said council member Scaffide, who was among critics. “Every time we have actual facts to say, ‘this isn’t a good idea,’ we are made to look like we’re anti-school.” There were also too many outstanding questions around how the school would be funded and how students would be served, she said.

In a written response signed by the Alpine Charter Board, the group aimed to dispel many of the criticisms about APA. 
“There have been significant rumors, inaccurate statements, and baseless lies being spread around our community about the Alpine Charter School project, and the proposed Education Service Provider, American Preparatory Academy,” the group wrote, adding that a group of community individuals “are actively engaged in an attempt to discredit this school and kill the opportunity for Alpine to finally obtain a public, community school.”
That didn’t mollify those concerned that APA was a bad fit for Alpine. 
A town divided 
Those concerns spilled into town council meetings over the winter and spring when the charter board asked to lease town land for the school. The land in question sits near the south end of the reservoir, and town council members expressed caution of promising away too much without certain guarantees. 
Mayor Green noted during a meeting that despite the need that everyone agrees is there, something this monumental cannot be rushed. 
“This is probably the biggest decision that’s happened [in Alpine] in the last 30 years,” he said. “And I don’t take that lightly.”
In December, the council presented the charter board with a list of demands: a roster of the fundraising foundation’s board and any contracts with APA, projected enrollment, financial documentation, building budgets, etc. Following that meeting, the apparently discouraged charter board pursued purchasing a private parcel for the school. Funk told a local radio program that “lawsuit threats, coercion, lies” had seeped into the process and he feared they would “lose this at the town level” due to the obstacles being put in the way.
Then, in March, a hasty town council meeting was convened. The charter board had an unexpected opportunity to purchase modular buildings for the school, but faced a tight purchase deadline. The board wanted to know if the town would lease it the property.
The opportunity was too good to pass up, Jenkins told the room. He repeatedly urged the council’s support . 
“If we lose these modulars, I don’t know how we’re going to do it,” he said. “Are you with us or not? That’s kind of what we’re saying to the town council tonight.” 
Frustrations boiled over, and decorum eroded as people shouted over one another and demanded to make public comment. The town attorney brought up a new letter from the airpark giving notice that the proposed location is in its unpublished flight path — basically the ground zone of aircraft trajectories. He called it a litigation threat. Tensions were thick.

Councilwoman Emily Castillo, who also served on the Alpine Education Committee, noted that as the mother of a toddler, she’s the only member of the council who stands to personally benefit from a charter school.
“But I have to look at all the factors,” she said, and she still had concerns. “This is town-owned land, which means that everybody owns it and everybody has a seat at the table.” 
In the end, the council passed a measure directing Mayor Green to work with the charter group and the airpark to find a property that works for all parties. Castillo and Scaffide voted against it. 
Around this time, a 2024 court judgement surfaced from a Utah civil lawsuit, with the judge finding that APA founder Sharette had defrauded her sister when the latter was cognitively impaired from a health condition. The sister, Laura Campbell, co-founded APA with Sharette. 
Just last week, the town issued a new lease stipulation for the charter board: select a different provider. 
Days later, the charter board began talks with Academica, a service provider to the Wyoming Classical Academy in Casper and Cheyenne Classical Academy. The Alpine charter group plans to amend its charter contract to reflect a new provider and present it to the state board by June 5. Academica can still offer the classical style of education, Jenkins said. 
Jenkins told the state charter board Wednesday the parties are closing in on a lease for town land. “We are hopefully within a week or two of having that back from the mayor,” he said during an update. 
A town ‘fractured’
What began as a lofty goal for the kids of Alpine has put the community’s adults through a stressful and acrimonious process. It’s not over yet, but those involved hope the provider change will smooth some of the edges. 
“I’m really relieved they’re moving away from APA,” Goodrich said. She hasn’t had a chance to look into Academica carefully, but said she has general concerns “about the charter school movement and diverting public funds away from public schools to private entities.”
Still, she is hopeful the latest development leads to more open conversations, she said. 
The charter board fought for APA for a long time, Jenkins said, so pivoting wasn’t easy. But the piece of town land is critical for a school, and the charter board is willing to make this concession if it means a school is possible, he said. 
“It’s tough, but what do you do?” he said when reached last week. 
Councilwoman Scaffide also hopes this is a turning point toward a better process. “What’s so hard at the end of the day is it’s so divided,” she said.  
When Scaffide thinks about all the factors straining the issue, she comes back to this feeling that the town has been kind of pushed aside by the school district and other entities and left to fend for itself.

“So it’s like, Lincoln County School District 2 doesn’t want us, Teton County [School District] can’t take us with their moratorium from over-crowding,” she said. “So we’re just this little island.”
Lawmakers pushed this charter and celebrated when the board authorized it, but, Scaffide asked, to what end? The charter board needs to approve charters that already have a building in place, she said. Instead of gifting something to Alpine, she said, the lawmakers “have just fractured our town.” 
The school district considers Alpine just as seriously as it does all the district communities, LCSD2 Superintendent Erickson contends. Right now, however, options that have been floated — like reconfiguring Etna to a K-6 school — don’t pencil out.
“We want to support as much as we can,” Erickson said of the town’s charter effort. “We totally understand the motivation behind it, and wish them nothing but the very, very best.”
Listening to the community   
The Alpine charter board originally envisioned opening the school to students this fall. That was revised to fall of 2026, and the group is still aiming at that ambitious goal, Jenkins said. 
“We’re very hopeful,” he added. “Alpine needs relief.”
During a virtual status update Wednesday afternoon, Jenkins told the Wyoming Charter School Authorizing Board the project is advancing, despite the many backslides. 
“We’re just going to keep moving forward until we can’t,” he said. “But so far, we just keep getting a little pathway forward.”
The new twist with the school provider was apparently serious enough to warrant a visit to Alpine from two Wyoming Charter School Authorizing Board representatives last week. 
One of those representatives, Chair Janine Bay Teske, summed up the situation like this: “You guys listened to your community, your community told you that APA wasn’t something that they really favored, and so you’re fixing that.” 
Meanwhile, Alpine kids have a few more weeks left of the school year. They will rise early, with many arriving at the bus stop before the rest of the town stirs.

The current judicial selection process doesn't need reform. It works well precisely because it's merit-based, attorney Khale Lenhart writes. 
The post Say no to those who would undermine Wyoming’s independent judiciary appeared first on WyoFile .","Recent news articles reported that some legislators want to change how Wyoming chooses judges from a merit-based process to an elected one. This proposal is difficult to understand because, frankly, our process works very well. It is merit-based, takes input from both legal professionals and community representatives, and removes bias and partisan leanings from the selection criteria. The only reason to change our process would be to create a new system that is not based on merit but is instead based on something else. This is a bad idea and would result in a worse, less professional judiciary.

Opinion

Wyoming’s judicial selection process works well precisely because it is merit-based. Under the Wyoming Constitution, the governor is limited in who he can appoint to the bench. A judicial nominating committee, consisting of both practicing attorneys and public representatives, is responsible for collecting applications, interviewing potential judges and forwarding a list of three names for each judicial vacancy to the governor. There is no campaigning and no partisanship when it comes to the selection of judges. Our constitution purposefully excludes political considerations from the process. It recognizes that judges must be independent of those pressures and features a system specifically designed to find the most qualified candidates.
The proposed changes would do away with the benefits of our existing system and introduce a far worse one. In fact, the proposed changes would revert to a system that was already abandoned as being inferior to the one we currently operate under. Approximately 50years ago, Wyoming citizens amended our state constitution to do away with judicial elections and instead adopted the merit-based system described above. 
The most difficult thing to understand about this proposal is the “why.” Our judges do good work and our selection process has produced quality nominees. The only reason that has been raised to justify a change is that certain legislators dislike certain recent rulings. They believe they can obtain judgments more favorable to their preferences if judges have to campaign for election. Simply put, they want to reduce the independence of the judiciary and make judges more political. 
Asking judges to run for election is a bad idea for several reasons. The most apparent is the potential for conflicts of interest. Elections cost money. If we ask judges to run for election, they will have to ask others for political donations to fund those campaigns. The potential for conflict in these situations is obvious. Judges may feel that they owe something to those who contributed to their campaigns, or those appearing before them may feel that they have better odds of prevailing should they contribute to the judge’s campaign fund. It is common to hear stories from states with judicial elections of judges calling attorneys for contributions, or of attorneys speculating on who gave the judge the largest donation and therefore has the upper hand in the lawsuit. Even if baseless, these questions undermine confidence in the judiciary and its impartiality. 
Further, campaigns take time and many otherwise qualified people do not want to go through the time and expense of a political campaign. Asking judges to campaign for office necessarily requires that they take time that they may have otherwise spent working on cases and instead spend that time acting like a political candidate. This would likely result in both a slowdown in judicial work during election season and a reduction in the number of qualified people willing to undertake the role. Again, our system is made worse, not better, by this proposal.
It is important to remember that the vast majority of cases are not the headline-grabbing decisions that we hear about most. Judges spend their days on criminal matters, large and small, divorces, custody cases, business disputes, personal injury lawsuits, probate hearings and countless other matters that are necessary for our world to operate. That is the real work of our judicial system. We should not ignore the need for quality judges to decide these cases. 
Simply put, our system for selecting judges works. We should not change it. Our judges are selected by merit for their abilities and political considerations are kept out of the process. That is as it should be. We must have confidence in our judicial branch to be able to decide disputes without worrying about whether their decisions would hurt a potential reelection campaign. Judges are insulated from these outside pressures for a reason, and we should continue to uphold that protection. Let’s hope that our Legislature recognizes the importance of an independent judiciary and spends its time tackling the real issues Wyoming faces.

(Screenshot/WisEye)Legislation to allow nurses with advanced training to practice independently has overcome objections that led the measure to be vetoed twice in the last four years, the Assembly’s health committee heard Tuesday.
AB 257 would create a new health care professional category of Advanced Practice Registered Nurse (APRN). APRNs would include certified nurse-midwives, certified registered nurse anesthetists, clinical nurse specialists and nurse practitioners.
Under the bill, an APRN would be permitted to practice on their own after working under the supervision of a medical doctor.
Currently, nurse practitioners in Wisconsin must have a continuing collaboration agreement with a practicing physician. Advocates for the legislation have said such agreements  shouldn’t be necessary for a fully trained APRN, and that some nurse practitioners have faced barriers in enlisting a collaborating doctor despite their own qualifications.
The legislation to end that requirement is a goal that organizations representing the nursing profession have been pursuing for more than a dozen years in Wisconsin. There are now 28 states that have a similar standard in place, advocates said.
At Tuesday’s public hearing on the bill before the Assembly Committee on Health, Aging and Long-term Care, advocates and one-time opponents of the measure alike appeared ready to see it finally enacted this year.
“Where health care providers are even more scarce, when the difference between a good outcome or a bad outcome is on the line, access to quality, dependable health care is everything,” said Rep. Tony Kurtz (R-Wonewoc), lead author of the Assembly bill, in his hearing testimony. “Recognizing APRNs will help ease the provider shortage we feel across our state and make Wisconsin a more attractive place for these professionals to practice.”
The bill “is important to meeting the demands for health care throughout Wisconsin and in particular our rural and at-risk populations,” said Terri Vandenhouten, a nurse practitioner in Brown County.  
Gov. Tony Evers vetoed a version of the APRN legislation in 2022 after it passed both houses of the Legislature, and he did so again in 2024.

This time around, Evers along with legislators from both parties spent time working through the objections that led to Evers’ previous vetoes.
“We had very good conversations with the governor’s office and came up with a compromise,” said Sen. Patrick Testin (R-Stevens Point), for whom the legislation has been a long-time goal. Testin said that “not everyone is 100% happy” with the bill in its current form — “which probably tells me we landed in a really good spot.”
As the last version of the bill was under debate, Evers laid down markers for three elements that he required before he would sign the measure: increasing the amount of training and supervision before an APRN can practice independently; requiring additional supervision for some APRN practitioners in the field of pain treatment; and ensuring that APRN practitioners didn’t use titles that might confuse patients about their credentials.
The new bill addresses all three points, said Testin.
Under the new bill, in order to be credentialed as an APRN, a nurse must have the equivalent of two years of practice under a doctor’s supervision. The new APRN must then work for another two years under a doctor’s collaborative supervision before going solo.
The bill added a requirement — sought by doctors in the field of pain medicine — requiring  APRN practitioners who treat pain syndrome and who use “invasive techniques” to work in collaboration with a pain medicine physician.
The bill also addresses the use of professional titles, which doctors have argued are sometimes improperly appropriated by providers without a physician’s credential. For an APRN to use a title, it must be one granted under Wisconsin’s nursing statutes, according to the bill.
An APRN with a doctorate may use the title of “Doctor,” but with identifying information about what field the degree is in, so patients don’t misinterpret the practitioner as being a physician.  
Representatives for the medical profession who have opposed previous versions of the bill told lawmakers Tuesday they now were officially neutral.
The Wisconsin chapter of the American College of Emergency Physicians hasn’t taken a position for or against the bill, said the group’s representative, Dr. Aurora Lybeck.
While she praised the “significant strides” in adding experience requirements, provider title protection and restrictions on pain practice, Lybeck said Wisconsin should institute specific requirements to staff emergency rooms with doctors.
Mark Grapentine, the Wisconsin Medical Society’s policy advocate, also testified that the doctors’ organization was now neutral on the measure after having opposed it. His remarks all but conceded that the arguments of the bill were now over.

“We are grateful that so many bipartisan members of the Legislature and that Gov. Evers listened to the concerns that physician groups brought forward and were able to include three of those important elements in the bill that you have before you,” he said.
Rep. Lisa Subeck (D-Madison), the health committee’s ranking Democrat, told the Wisconsin Examiner that years of working on the bill as well as Evers’ role in encouraging a resolution helped the legislation reach a point where its enactment now seems likely.
“This was a good example of a bill where there was both bipartisan support and bipartisan opposition,” Subeck said. “It felt like we were a long way from getting it done, and I think the governor has really helped to get this bill moving forward.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-14-9.14.21-PM-1024x627.png,,,2025-05-15 07:05:32.305057

Francesca Hong)This year marks the 50th anniversary of the resettlement of Hmong refugees in Wisconsin. During a press conference Wednesday morning, Brenda Yang, the first Hmong person to serve on the Dane County Board of Supervisors, reflected on a complicated question: What does it mean to be Hmong?
“Is it one’s genetics? Is it being born into a Hmong family? Is it about the values of the community and prioritizing collective needs over individual needs or is it about knowing how to speak the Hmong language?” Yang mused.
“As I reflect on the many ways that I am Hmong, I realize that every new generation among us has had to wrestle with what it means to be Hmong, and despite the challenges of extinction, we have endured and overcome them through reimagining and redefining what it means to be Hmong, wherever we reside.”
In 1975, in the aftermath of the Vietnam War, Hmong families began resettling in the U.S., including in Wisconsin, aided by church organizations. According to the Hmong American Center, the U.S. government enlisted Hmong allies to assist with its “secret war” — the covert military operations carried out in Laos during the Vietnam War against the North Vietnamese and the Pathet Lao. Hmong were persecuted by the Lao and Vietnamese governments as a result, forcing them to flee. The last group of Hmong refugee families came to the U.S. between June 2004 and May 2006.
At the Wednesday press conference, organized by the Legislative Asian Caucus, Yang highlighted the work of several Hmong Dane County community members including Manila Kue, who is the founder and CEO of Grand Journey, an organization that provides support services for Hmong and Southeast Asian elders, and Nkauj Nou Vang-Vue, who is the the first school principal of Hmong descent in the Madison Metropolitan School District and also leads the only Hmong-English Language Immersion Program in Wisconsin. She said the leaders are prime examples of people working to embrace their cultural identity as a way to heal and reconcile with the past traumas endured by Hmong and Southeast Asian communities.
“I am reminded that to be Hmong is to be free. I come from a long line of deep history, rich culture and immense resilience,” Yang said. “To be Hmong is to be free and to be free means to not only liberate ourselves but also to liberate others.”
Tammie Xiong, the executive director of the Hmong American Women’s Association, was born in the U.S. to Hmong refugees and she said she has “made it my duty to never forget what happened and why.” Families including hers, she said, “came as Hmong and Southeast Asian refugees uprooted from our homelands, resettled in a country whose language we did not speak, into a new context we would have to learn to live and build community in.”
The state Assembly approved two resolutions this week, including one to celebrate 50 years of strength and resilience of the Hmong, Lao, Cambodian and Vietnamese people and another to commemorate Hmong-Lao Veterans Day and honor the Hmong-Lao veterans who served with U.S. soldiers in the Vietnam War. Xiong said those resolutions are an important step in remembering history.
“The 50th year allows us to look back on where we have been, what we have been able to build here in the U.S.,” Xiong said. “We have gone to school. Some of us have become entrepreneurs, adding to the U.S. economy. Many of us are teachers, mental health practitioners, carpenters, artists, community organizers, researchers, healers, scientists, caretakers. The list goes on and on and these are also positions that continue to nourish and support the community.”
“We must never forget and we will never forget,” Xiong said.
Wisconsin is now the state with the third largest Hmong population in the U.S. with over 55,000 people. Xiong noted that they are “a young community, where the median age is 26 years old, and many of us here in Wisconsin still live at or below the poverty level.”
“Our communities did not come here by choice,” Zon Moua, director of organizing for Dane County-based nonprofit Freedom Inc, said. “We came here because of war, because of displacement, and because of U.S. foreign policy and when we arrived, we were given very little to rebuild our lives, and for five decades, southeast Asian people have worked tirelessly to survive, to heal and to build futures for ourselves and our families.
Moua said the anniversary commemoration is also about looking forward and working to improve the lives of Hmong people in Wisconsin.
“What we need is our elected leaders to choose not only to stand with us today, but to act with us tomorrow,” Moua said. She called for fully funding culturally specific victim services, investing in housing and supporting leadership pathways for Southeast Asian youth, “especially those who are trans and queer.”
“It means teaching our history in schools and making sure our communities are no longer an afterthought,” she said. “We are here to build and we invite you to build with us.”
Pheng Thao, who is the co-executive director of Southeast Asian Action and Southeast Asian Freedom Network, called attention to the challenges that some Hmong and Asian Americans are now facing from the Trump administration.
A Hmong woman who was born in Thailand and has lived in the Milwaukee-area since she was eight months old, was recently swept up in the Trump administration’s deportation efforts and sent to Laos — a country she had never been to and where she doesn’t speak the language.
“Those who came here as refugees, my generation, are being detained and deported back to Laos, a country that they do not know or to Cambodia, a country that they’ve never seen or to Vietnam to a place that they do not know the language…,” Thao said. “This is double punishment, and this is something that our families are forced to reconcile with again, and our community is forced to reconcile with forced family separation again.”

The legislation comes as anti-abortion advocates seek to crack down on doctors who ship of abortion-inducing medication to states where abortion is illegal. In nearly all cases, abortion has been illegal in Louisiana since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022. 
House Bill 575 by Rep. Lauren Ventrella, R-Greenwell Springs, passed on a 59-29 vote. She has dubbed her proposal the “Justice for Victims of Abortion Drug Dealers Act,” though it would apply to all forms of the procedure. 
Ventrella’s bill is supported by Attorney General Liz Murrill, who is currently prosecuting a case against a New York doctor accused of providing abortion-inducing medication to a minor in West Baton Rouge Parish. Gov. Kathy Hoschul has refused to extradite the doctor to Louisiana to face charges, citing New York’s shield laws. 
The doctor and the minor’s mother were both indicted. Murrill has alleged the minor was coerced to take the medication, though her mother was not charged with this crime.
Current law allows the “mother of the unborn child” to sue any person who performs an abortion, but Ventrella’s bill adds her parents, the man who impregnated her and his parents as potential plaintiffs. They could sue anyone who causes or “substantially facilitates” an abortion, regardless of whether the procedure was successful. The bill denies men the right to sue if the pregnancy was the result of rape, sexual assault or incest.

The bill’s opponents argued it could lead to lawsuits that violate the privacy of people alleged to have had an abortion. 
“My fear is you’re involving a lot of other people … Some women I’ve known, and I’m sure you’ve known, have had repetitive miscarriages through no fault of their own,” Rep. Stephanie Hilferty, R-New Orleans, said. “The last thing I want is somebody bringing this saying, ‘Well, there’s no way there can be this many miscarriages,’ and that’s going to pull this woman and her medical records into a potential lawsuit.” 
Ventrella said plaintiffs still have to meet the burden of proof. 
“Frivolous lawsuits are taken care of on the front end,” she said.

Republican and Democratic legislators raised concerns about the procedural language of the proposal. 
Rep. Brian Glorioso, R-Slidell, asked Ventrella to delay a vote on her bill to work out what he sees as potential kinks. The legislation would create absolute liability, which does not require proof of negligence or fault, he said. Most Louisiana lawsuits require plaintiffs to prove liability rather than the law assuming it, Glorioso said in an interview. 
Glorioso said he would have supported the bill if Ventrella addressed some of the procedural concerns he has. He was absent from the House chamber when lawmakers voted on the bill, as were several other Republican lawmakers who were present for other votes Wednesday. 
Rep. Mandie Landry, D-New Orleans, raised concerns that Ventrella’s bill does not define “cause,” which she said could lead to people being sued for loaning money for an abortion, driving someone to a clinic or other actions that support a person who has an abortion. 
Ellie Schilling, an attorney who represented abortion providers before the state ban took effect, said that while the title of the bill includes the word “unlawful,” it’s the only time it appears in the bill.  That would allow lawsuits to be brought against providers of legal abortions, she said. 
While they are rare, Louisiana law does allow abortions when a doctor believes they are necessary to “prevent the death or substantial risk of death” of a pregnant person. 
In its original state, Ventrella’s bill would have also allowed drug manufacturers to be sued, but she added amendments to the bill to exclude them. Abortion-inducing drugs, most commonly mifepristone and misoprostol, have a number of other uses, including for miscarriage management, treating postpartum hemorrhage and inducing labor.
Last year, lawmakers reclassified both drugs as controlled dangerous substances despite concerns from medical professionals it could make them more difficult to access in time-sensitive medical crises. 
Ventrella’s bill would allow a judge to award a minimum of $100,000 in damages if the defendant is not licensed to practice medicine in Louisiana, is not licensed to dispense medication in Louisiana or is a foreign company. Plaintiffs can also receive damages for emotional distress, court costs, attorneys fees and additional damages when the pregnant person is a minor. 
House Bill 425 by Rep. Josh Carlson, R-Lafayette, passed on an 80-10 vote. 
His measure would expand the definition of coerced abortion, which is currently defined in state law as the “use or threatened use of force, control, or intimidation” against a pregnant woman to compel her to undergo an abortion against her will, regardless of whether the procedure has been attempted or completed. 
Carlson’s legislation originally sought to expand the definition of coerced abortion to include the pregnant person’s actions, but it was substantially trimmed back in committee to add battery, assault, simple kidnapping, false imprisonment and extortion to the existing definition.

(Photo: Hyosung HICO)A South Korean power transformer manufacturer announced Wednesday it will expand operations at its U.S. headquarters in Memphis.
Hyosung HICO will invest $51 million into its 360,000-square-foot facility located on a 200-acre plot near the Mississippi River in South Memphis.
The expansion is expected to add 123 new jobs in Shelby County, according to the Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development. The facility currently employs about 400 people.
Hyosung HICO is a subsidiary of Hyosung Heavy Industries, which was founded in South Korea in 1962 and delivered its first power transformer to North America in 1998, according to the company’s website. Hyosung Heavy Industries manufactures electrical power equipment including transformers, switchgears, energy storage systems and SMART Grid solutions.
Hyosung HICO purchased the Memphis manufacturing plant in 2019 from Mitsubishi Electric. 
The plant became the South Korean company’s first in the U.S. when it opened in 2020 to be closer to North American electric utility customers, the website states. 
The Memphis and Shelby County Economic Development and Growth Engine (EDGE) approved $10 million in tax breaks for the deal in 2019. State records show a $5 million grant for the same year.
The facility has manufactured transformers for some of Nashville-based solar power company Silicon Ranch’s Tennessee solar farms.
“We are committed to executing this expansion with the firm belief that only companies that succeed in the U.S. market can secure true competitiveness,” Hyosung Heavy Industries CEO Taehee Woo said in a news release. “Today’s expansion of our Memphis transformer facility marks a major milestone in our U.S. growth strategy and underscores our vision to become the #1 supplier of large power transformers in the country by 2027, and the leading supplier of solutions by the end of this decade.”

(Camilla Forte/The Hechinger Report)Jaci Grado has wanted to be an educator since she was in kindergarten. Her love of teaching solidified in high school when she worked at an after-school program in her hometown of Schuyler, Nebraska. 
The biggest employer in Schuyler is the Cargill beef processing plant, which relies on immigrant labor. More than 70 percent of the town’s 6,500 residents are Latino, including Grado, whose parents immigrated from Mexico. The second-biggest employer is the school system, which struggles to hire and keep teachers, much like rural communities nationwide.

Grado is wrapping up her sophomore year in the University of Nebraska-Lincoln’s teacher-training program. The first person in her family to go to college, she has been able to attend thanks to a scholarship program co-directed by UNL and Kansas State University to support aspiring teachers from rural places like Schuyler who could fill vacancies in their hometown schools. It’s a program the Nebraska Examiner highlighted in February.
“I never would have thought it was possible for me to come to a university like this one,” said Grado. “This was kind of like a dream that came true.”
That dream is in jeopardy because the scholarship program supporting Grado — like dozens of other efforts to train and retain rural educators — relies on federal grants eliminated by the Trump administration. In February, the Department of Education abruptly canceled $600 million in grants it said promoted “divisive ideologies” such as diversity, equity and inclusion. 
Two lawsuits filed in federal court against the cuts — one by the attorneys general of eight Democrat-led states and another by membership organizations of teacher colleges and teacher-residency programs — argued the department lacked the authority to abruptly withhold funds appropriated by Congress and that the cuts would cause “immediate and irreparable harm” to schools and students. 
In both cases, district courts temporarily restored funding, but in April, those judgments were overruled — one by the U.S. Supreme Court and the other by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit — allowing the cancellations to stay in place until further judicial review.
The Education Department, which did not respond to interview requests, has never provided a complete list of the terminated grants, but they included money for more than 200 projects under three programs designed to recruit and train teachers through scholarships, teacher-residency programs, mentoring, professional development and salary bonuses tied to gains in student learning. The funding cuts have forced many of those initiatives to lay off staff, withdraw scholarships and shut down altogether. 
In some cases, delays in official termination notices combined with emergency funding from universities and foundations have kept programs operating, but long-term prospects are precarious at best, given the Trump administration’s efforts to not only cancel the grant programs but eyeing the entire Education Department. 
Grado’s program has backfilled some money to cover expenses, but not the scholarship portion, which only has guaranteed funding for the remainder of the semester. 
Some educators, experts and advocates say the grant cancellations threaten to exacerbate teacher shortages in many rural communities, forcing schools to rely more on underqualified teachers and worsening outcomes for students. Research on earlier teacher-training projects supported by the same federal grant programs suggest they have helped districts stem teacher vacancies and keep educators in classrooms.  
“These types of teacher support programs are critical to rural schools trying to compete for the best teachers for their students,” said Robert Stafford, executive director of the Kentucky Rural Education Association, a nonprofit that supports rural educators. “When you’ve made those plans and developed partnerships and understandings with universities and others, and then you have that support pulled out from underneath you, it can be devastating for a small school district.”

Research consistently shows that high-quality teachers are the most important factor in student achievement — yet there’s a chronic shortage of them in low-income schools. The three grant programs targeted in February — the Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP), the Supporting Effective Educator Development (SEED) and the Teacher and School Leader Incentive (TSL) programs — were established during the Obama administration to bolster the teaching ranks in high-need districts.
The most severe teacher shortages are in rural areas, largely because of high turnover, according to a 2023 study co-authored by Richard Ingersoll, professor of education and sociology at the University of Pennsylvania. High-poverty rural schools needed to replace 28 percent of teachers every year, compared with 19 percent in high-poverty urban schools, the study found. 
Teachers also were twice as likely to move from rural to urban or suburban schools as they were to move in the opposite direction.
“It’s not a happy story,” Ingersoll said.
Recent efforts to alleviate teacher shortages have focused on recruiting more local teacher talent. For example, the program supporting Grado, which began in 2023 and was funded by a three-year, $3.4 million federal grant, partners with six rural districts in the region. 
Dubbed Project RAÍCES, which means roots in Spanish, the program sponsors high school clubs that engage students in community issues and has awarded 16 full college scholarships to students planning to pursue teaching with the expectation that they’ll return to lead classrooms in their communities. 
Importantly, Project RAÍCES continues to support new teachers in their first years in the classroom, when quit rates tend to be high, by offering free professional development and paying stipends to experienced educators who serve as mentors, among other ways. 
Trump push against ‘DEI hires’ and diversity efforts hits home in Nebraska 

Bret Schroder, superintendent of Schuyler Community Schools, said in recent years his district and others have turned to recruiting teachers from overseas; last year, he hired roughly a dozen teachers from the Philippines. 
“Nothing against these teachers,” he said. “But would I rather have a plethora of available teachers who grew up here, know the kids and their families and are already embedded in the community? Absolutely.” 
Many of the imperiled programs support teacher residencies, modeled on medical residencies, that combine coursework with teaching jobs and pair scholarships with a commitment to teach in a district partnering with the program. 
While many of the specific programs were too new to demonstrate results, studies of other teacher residencies and of programs providing ongoing support for budding educators show the models can help. For example, one report on teacher-residency programs nationwide cited research suggesting that 50 percent of teachers in high-needs schools leave the profession within five years, while 70 to 80 percent of participants in residency programs are not only still in the profession, but in the same district, after five years. 
At East Carolina University, a residency program called edPirate supports 10 new teachers a year who commit to spending three years in one of six rural districts. The initiative (named after the East Carolina mascot) began in 2022 with a five-year, $4.8 million federal grant. 
When the funding was terminated in February, program leaders scrambled to find emergency support from university sources to cover stipends for the remainder of the semester, but they had to let go of project staff, cancel contracts for things like program evaluation and certification support and stop all recruiting efforts for next year’s crop of teachers. 
One of the rural districts partnering with East Carolina is Elizabeth City-Pasquotank, in North Carolina, where about 450 teachers serve a coastal town of about 19,000 people. Elizabeth City Superintendent Keith Parker said federal funding has been essential to districts like his with smaller populations and lower tax revenues. 
He credited the support for helping him attract applicants and reduce vacancies from more than 40 in the summer of 2022 to only four today. Parker noted that vacancies peak in the summer and said he anticipated them to tick up before the next academic year.  
“These grants have allowed us to be competitive,” he said. “We’ve been able to say to a young college graduate, ‘Come here and teach, commit to us, because there are opportunities for you to grow here.’” 
In addition, Parker said the terminated grants paid the salaries of at least four teachers, and the district needed to find a couple hundred thousand dollars immediately to pay them for the remainder of this academic year, requiring the cancellation or postponement of several dozen school maintenance projects, such as repairing leaky roofs. 
Parker’s district also partnered with another teacher-pipeline project funded by a recently terminated grant — an initiative to give rural teachers bonuses based on improved student achievement. That project was led by The Innovation Project (TIP), a collaboration of public school systems across North Carolina. 
Teachers in Elizabeth City and seven other rural districts were expecting to receive performance-based bonuses of up to $7,500 at the end of this school year, but there’s no money now to pay them — a “devastating” loss, according to Parker. 
TIP had to lay off support staff and four experienced teacher coaches they had hired from across the state to help mentor new teachers in rural partner districts. 
“It was absolutely heartbreaking, to tell people, ‘As of 5 p.m. today, you no longer have a job, and we can’t pay you any sort of severance or anything,’” said Sharon Contreras, TIP’s chief executive officer. “That’s no way to treat this nation’s educators.”
The cuts caught educators by surprise. In mid-February, a wave of form letters from the Department of Education, identical except for the recipients’ names and grant numbers, hit the grantees’ inboxes. The letters, signed by Mark Washington, the department’s deputy assistant secretary for management and planning, informed recipients that their grants were being terminated because they funded “programs that promote or take part in DEI initiatives or other initiatives that unlawfully discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, or another protected characteristic.” 
The letters demanded an immediate stop to all spending and gave recipients 30 days to appeal. 
“There was a lot of confusion, and a lot of chaos about what does this actually mean,” said Ben Seipel, a professor of education and graduate program director at California State University-Chico who leads the GREAT Teachers Pipeline, which received a three-year, $13.4 million grant in 2022 to recruit, train and support hundreds of teachers from a largely rural area of Northern California about the size of Ohio. 
The program was in the final year of the grant when it was terminated. While the university was able to secure enough alternative funding to cover the program’s spring semester obligations, recruiting for next fall’s teachers went forward without assurances that money would be available.
Seipel and his team also scaled back plans for summer professional development workshops for teachers in their partner districts and shelved plans to track the longer-term impact of the teachers they trained for rural schools after the Education Department canceled the call for new grant applications. 
The primary goal of the three federal grant programs at the center of the legal battles is to train and support skilled teachers for districts that need them most, according to the funding priorities published by the Education Department. All three also focus on increasing teacher diversity as a secondary goal. 
The grantees interviewed for this story said their projects did not rely on quotas or preferences based on race or other demographic categories, as the termination letter alleged. Instead, they said their efforts increased educator diversity by lowering the barriers to pursuing a teaching career and by recruiting local teacher talent from communities with diverse populations.

The legal cases center not on questions of diversity, though, but on whether the Education Department has the authority to terminate grant programs established by Congress.
The decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals to let the cancellations stand for now is not promising for the plaintiffs. Regardless of what the courts ultimately decide, it appears likely that the Education Department will end most of its support for teacher-training programs going forward.
President Donald Trump’s executive order to dismantle the department, signed March 20, calls for returning power over education to the states. Already the education agency has lost thousands of staff members through layoffs and resignations, and it is investigating moving some responsibilities, including special education programs, to other agencies such as the Department of Health and Human Services. 
“We currently have our applications open for the fall,” said Seipel of Chico State, “but we know that some students are hesitant, because they just can’t trust that the money will be there.”
As for Grado, she’s determined to find a way to finish college, even though she’s not sure how she might pay for it — maybe loans, maybe taking a job at one of the packing plants to save money for tuition. In addition to her classwork, her training includes teaching periodic lessons at a nearby elementary school. 
“I love being there, and I constantly think of my kids back home, and how much I would love to return and teach,” she said. “I mean, that’s what I came here for.”

(Photo by Ariel Skelley/Getty Images)U.S. Mike Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, should be lauded for his vocal and enthusiastic support of increasing and renewing the Child Tax Credit.  It is one of those pandemic-era programs that made a big difference in a working, Idaho family’s ability to survive and thrive during tough times. 
In many ways, the times have not improved. It is not easy or inexpensive to have and raise kids in 2025, and Sen. Crapo’s support for the Child Tax Credit reflects a sensitivity to that challenge.
Amid protests and Democratic pushback, U.S. House GOP launches work on Medicaid cuts

I would like to see him extend the same support to the 89,000 Idaho families that do not have enough income to qualify for the tax credit under the proposed guidelines. Those families face the same costs and the same challenges, but they have fewer resources to deal with it.
But on the issue of the proposed cuts to Medicaid, Sen. Crapo’s statements are much more cautious. 
I first met Sen. Crapo in 1989 when I was working with a group of people attempting to move the state of Idaho to adopt Personal Care Services as an option of the state’s Medicaid program. We met in his office during the time he served as the Idaho Senate’s president pro tempore. 
He agreed to let our bill get a hearing, a controversial stance due to the opposition of some in the Idaho Legislature. He struck me as fair minded and willing to do the right thing, even if that thing was controversial.
By 1990, a Personal Care Services bill was signed by Gov. Cecil Andrus and the program has subsequently allowed elders to stay in their own home, with assistance, rather than being placed in a nursing home. And it has given people with disabilities, who otherwise would be institutionalized, the option to live in community. 
Fast forward to 2025 and the national clamor to cut Medicaid due to waste, fraud, and abuse. Sen. Crapo has stated that he is not in favor of cutting benefits or coverage under Medicaid, but it is possible to cut the budget without technically changing the rules about coverage and benefits. It hardly matters if one qualifies for benefits and coverage if the dollars are not there to make it a reality. 
Cutting the budget will result in fewer people being served, services being cut out, and new recipients on waiting lists for years. Idaho has avoided wait lists, and most people with disabilities cannot wait for years to access services. 
What always gets lost in this loud and vocal conversation that implies that users of Medicaid are engaging in waste, fraud and abuse is the unavoidable fact that big cuts to the Medicaid budget nationally will fall heavily on people with disabilities. The result will be life threatening harm to the same people we were working to protect in 1990 – elders and people with disabilities. 
I personally know many adults with disabilities and families caring for their disabled family member. The suggestion that the families and individuals I know are engaging in waste or abuse is beyond outrageous. They carry huge burdens even with Medicaid assisting them. 
The pandemic took a nationwide toll on the services for people with disabilities. The headline of an article last week from Disability Scoop, a national newspaper on disability-related issues stated, “Nation’s Disability Services System Begins To Buckle As Funding Threats Intensify.”
And this characterization of services for people with disabilities was about other cuts being pushed through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services — before the proposed cuts to Medicaid have landed. Large cuts to Medicaid on top of the cuts in services already being rolled out will produce actual harm, real hardship and catastrophic overload for Idaho families caring for family members with disabilities. Surely that is not a good strategy to address waste, fraud, and abuse. It is more like an inquisition than problem solving.
Sen. Crapo needs to exhibit the same fair mindedness we witnessed in 1989 as we discussed personal care services, the same sensitivity that he is exhibiting for the plight of Idaho families raising children in 2025 – AND he should stand up for Medicaid with the same vocal enthusiasm he has brought to the Child Tax Credit. It is the right thing to do, even if it is a controversial stand within his own party.

DemasDuring his weekly media briefing, Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) continued to air grievances with Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson over the Department of State’s new financial disclosure portal. However, that frustration, and a looming disclosure deadline, proved to be the catalyst needed for the Republican-led House and the Democratic-led Senate to temporarily break a monthslong deadlock.
Since the introduction of the new financial reporting system on March 14, the system has been criticized by politicians, reporters and government officials, who have noted the information offers less information than the previous portal, which was locked behind a login screen. 
Benson’s Chief Communications Officer Angela Benander previously told the Advance that the department had been behind schedule when preparing for the launch of the new system. Switching between systems meant migrating a massive amount of data between the platforms, she said, creating delays that dramatically reduced the department’s ability to conduct pre-launch data testing, resulting in errors and problems with the system’s performance.

“We understand this is a problem. We are working to fix it as quickly as possible but have had to prioritize the parts of the system that allow filers to meet their legal requirements by the filing deadline. Once the project is complete, this system will be much more transparent and accessible than the old system and the temporary issues we’re experiencing now will be fully resolved,” Benander said. 
However, two days before public office holders were required to submit reports detailing their assets, income, any properties they own over $1,000 and any liabilities of $10,000 or greater, Hall said lawmakers were still experiencing difficulties with the website. 
“I talked to our members, and I talked to a lot of politicians, and I said, ‘How’s the website working?’ And they say, ‘Every time we go on there, it crashes, I submit my information, and it crashes. [There are] website errors, there’s poor site mapping. The platform is failing…. You get all the way to the end and it crashes, and then you got to start over. You’re in there. You’re halfway through the whole thing resets,” Hall said. 
Amid these difficulties Hall said Senate Minority Leader Winnie Brinks had reached out to make a deal to extend the timeline for 2025, with the House altering a pair of policies passed by the Senate at the end of April to extend the 2025 filing deadline from May 15 to June 13 and to prescribe the form used to file these disclosures, where the form was previously created by Department of State. Hall also called for an option to submit the forms via email, which was already included in the policies. 
Gov. Gretchen Whitmer put her pen to the bills Wednesday afternoon, approving the changes alongside additional alterations to the disclosure requirements. 
During the previous filing cycle, members of the Michigan House and Senate, the Attorney General, Governor, Lt. Governor, Secretary of State were required to disclose the name and occupation of their spouse, their spouse’s employer, whether their spouse was registered as a lobbyist agent during the reporting period and any stocks, bonds, or other securities valued at $1,000 held by the individual filing or held jointly with their spouse, with some exceptions.
Sens. Jeremy Moss (D-Southfield) and Ed McBroom’s (R-Vulcan) Senate Bills 99 and 100 alter those requirements to only require disclosure of a spouse’s occupation and employer if their annual income was more than $1,000. 
They also require public officers and candidates to list the origins and addresses for sources of unearned income and securities, as well as the names of lobbyists who make gifts, gift payments, travel payments, or payments to a charity on behalf of the public officer. 
In response to the changes, Benander told the Michigan Advance in an email that the Department of State “has been working nights and weekends to make sure the online system is ready for the personal financial disclosure deadline,” noting that the department already allowed filers to submit their reports via email, sending a message to filers on Friday informing them of the alternative.
“We will continue to support filers through the extended 2025 deadline, but we believe the additional provisions in the bills move us further away from the transparency Michigan’s voters demanded when they passed Proposal 1 in 2022. Specifically, these bills do not require officials to describe the value of their assets, investments, and liabilities,” Benander said. 
“Michigan is behind nearly every other state in requiring transparency from lawmakers and public officials. We should be doing everything we can to make our state a leader for government transparency and accountability,” Benander said. 
In an email, Brinks spokesperson Rosie Jones said there are still issues with the disclosure process that require a legislative solution. 
“There has been a standing agreement between the majorities to solve this and we are making progress on that,” Jones said.

School-based health services nationwide are partially funded through Medicaid, and some advocates worry about potential cuts. (Jon Cherry | Getty Images)Even as Republicans in Congress walk back their most aggressive proposal to slash federal Medicaid spending, they are weighing other options that could force states to cut services for children and other vulnerable populations.
U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters last week that his caucus won’t reduce the 90% federal funding match that states get to cover working-age adults who became eligible for Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. However, the GOP is still considering capping federal spending by setting a fixed amount for how much states receive for every Medicaid enrollee.
That move would fundamentally change the nature of the program, which has been an open-ended entitlement since its passage 60 years ago.
Another Republican congressional proposal would limit states’ ability to increase Medicaid payments to doctors and hospitals by using tax revenue they collect from health care providers. States draw down additional federal dollars by utilizing the strategy, and the extra money helps many hospitals stay afloat.
Any federal cuts to Medicaid — large or small — would strain state budgets and likely lead to service cuts and coverage for fewer people, according to a new analysis released last week by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
The agency predicted that to make up for lost federal dollars, states would have to reduce payments to health care providers, curb benefits or reduce enrollment. Some advocates also suggest that states might seek savings in other areas of their budgets, such as K-12 education.
Child health advocates say any of those actions would have a significant trickle-down effect on children and their caregivers. They’re concerned states would have to reduce or even eliminate services that help tens of millions of children access routine care that’s critical from birth, such as vaccinations and physical exams.
Half of U.S. kids
About half of the nation’s 72.8 million children are covered by Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP, another joint federal-state program that covers children from families who earn too much to qualify for traditional Medicaid.
“I think what is missing from some of these debates is [Medicaid] is not only the primary payer for children’s health, it’s also supporting the safety net for children’s health, by paying for hospitals, clinics, physicians and offices,” said Heather Howard, a former New Jersey health commissioner who is now a faculty affiliate with the Center for Health and Wellbeing at Princeton University.
“It’ll mean that hospitals will close in rural areas, but even in urban areas, we’re going to see, as hospitals see their funding cut, they’re going to have to pull back on services,” Howard added. “And that clearly is going to impact kids.”
Mississippi pediatrician Dr. John Gaudet said the importance of Medicaid for children begins at birth; Medicaid covered 41% of all U.S. births in 2021. The program also covers a benefit package called Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment, which covers an array of critical services meant to take care of childhood mental and physical health, such as dental and vision care, vaccinations, lab tests and physical exams.
The program serves children struggling with severe emotional distress, as well as physical disabilities. Medicaid pays for long-term and home-based care services.
Gaudet says he’s afraid that a variety of child-related services could be affected by federal Medicaid cuts.
“As a pediatrician, I’m very concerned about prevention and wellness, because that’s going to give you more return on your investment in the long run, if you can prevent an illness rather than wait until it gets more severe and then you’re having to treat it,” Gaudet said in an interview.
School health services
Medicaid cuts also could affect the health services offered in schools.
Between $4 billion and $6 billion in annual Medicaid spending helps pay for school-based health services, including routine health screenings, preventive care, mental health care and physical, speech and occupational therapies.
Children from underserved communities disproportionately rely on school-based health services, according to Abuko Estrada, vice president of Medicaid and child health policy at First Focus on Children, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit group.
“We’re not only talking about things like higher emergency room utilization for kids or increased hospitalizations for preventable conditions,” Estrada said in an interview. “We’re also talking about lost educational opportunities, potentially reduced future earnings in adulthood, and perpetuating cycles of poor health that ultimately cost the nation far more than it would potentially save.”












As hospitals see their funding cut, they're going to have to pull back on services. And that clearly is going to impact kids.

But Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that is working with Republicans to imagine Medicaid cuts, wrote in an email to Stateline that the ideas circulating on Capitol Hill wouldn’t harm children at all. Rather, he said, the proposed cuts would shift the funding focus away from working-age adults toward children and more vulnerable populations.
“In my view, it is a moral imperative for Congress to protect the program for the truly vulnerable and end Washington’s discrimination in favor of non-disabled, working-age, childless adults,” wrote Blase, who was a health care adviser to President Donald Trump during his first term.
Chris Pope, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning policy group the Manhattan Institute, said he doesn’t think Republicans in Congress will be able to cut much from Medicaid.
Republicans couldn’t get the votes to make major changes when they tried in 2017, Pope noted, and they have even fewer votes this year. “Unless they can get every Republican to sign off on cuts,” he said, “it’s just not going to happen.”
Republicans in Congress are trying to find roughly $2 trillion in savings to offset the cost of extending tax cuts enacted during the first Trump administration and to make additional tax cuts. The U.S. House committee that oversees Medicaid is supposed to come up with $880 billion of that total.
Despite Johnson’s assertion that reducing the federal Medicaid match for working-age adults is off the table, some fiscal hawks in his own party aren’t ready to give up the idea, which would save more money than any other proposal.
“It’s necessary to stop robbing from the vulnerable to fund the able-bodied,” U.S. Rep. Chip Roy of Texas wrote on X shortly after Johnson’s comments were reported.
In a May 7 letter to House Republican leaders, 32 GOP representatives vowed to find $2 trillion in cuts, calling the House budget framework “a floor for savings, not a ceiling. We must hold that line on fiscal discipline to put the country back on a sustainable path,” the letter said.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)A new Tennessee law with the unassuming acronym “PEACE” might appear, on the surface, to be a mundane update to the state’s criminal code. But tucked into the legislation’s language is a clear and deliberate threat to the First Amendment freedoms of Tennesseans. 
On Friday, Gov. Bill Lee signed Senate Bill 30, the Protecting Everyone Against Crime and Extremism Act (PEACE Act).The law makes it a criminal offense to leave “unsolicited flyers” on public or private property, hang signs from overpasses and bridges, ride in the back of a box truck, refuse to give one’s name or give a false name to law enforcement, and approach within 25 feet of an officer after being ordered to stop or retreat.
While these provisions might sound like routine penalties for littering, limits on approaching police officers and tweaks to law enforcement powers, they raise serious First Amendment concerns.  
One of the most troubling aspects of the law is its expansion of the state’s intimidation law to criminalize acts like handing out flyers or trespassing if done with the “intent to intimidate” someone from exercising their rights. This language is dangerously vague, and that’s exactly the problem. “Intent to intimidate” is not clearly defined and can easily be used to target protestors, demonstrators, or anyone expressing dissent in a way that makes someone uncomfortable. 
Bill expanding Tennessee law enforcement powers during protests draws pushback

Additionally, the law classifies dropping “unsolicited flyers” on private or public property as “littering,” which means a political pamphlet left on a doorstep could potentially lead to a criminal charge. The Supreme Court has long held that leafleting is protected speech, not trash. In Lovell v. City of Griffin (1938), Schneider v. State (1939), Talley v California (1960) and Watchtower v. Village of Stratton (2002), the Court affirmed that the right to distribute printed material, especially for political or religious purposes, lies at the heart of the First Amendment.
 The Tennessee law’s new provisions also prohibit approaching within 25 feet of a law enforcement officer after being ordered to stop. Although the amended version narrows this to active crime scenes, traffic stops, or public safety threats, it still violates the public’s right to record and monitor police conduct in public spaces. Federal courts have increasingly recognized this right as an essential check on government power. In Glik v. Cunniffe (2011), the First Circuit wrote that “[t]he filming of government officials engaged in their duties in a public place… fits comfortably” within the principles of protected First Amendment expression.
As if these aspects of the law were not concerning enough, it also grants police broader authority to arrest individuals for misdemeanors not committed in their presence and provides legal immunity to officers who decide later not to issue citations for these alleged offenses. In combination with the new criminal categories for expressive conduct, this gives law enforcement a wide berth to intimidate and arrest peaceful demonstrators, especially in politically charged settings. 
Legal advocates have tracked similar efforts around the country where these minor offenses are not used against litterers and loiters but as a means to shut down protests. This would give the government wider latitude to target speech that the party in power doesn’t like, from climate activists to pro-life protestors to labor union strikes.  
Supporters of this law may argue that these provisions promote public order or protect communities from hate. But the First Amendment does not allow the government to punish speech simply because it is offensive or hateful. The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that even the most disturbing or bigoted speech is protected unless it is intended and likely to provoke imminent lawless action, amounts to a true threat, or defamation. 
Laws that target speech based on the speaker’s motive or viewpoint and give broad discretion to law enforcement violate fundamental constitutional principles. The PEACE Act presents significant risks of overreach and is likely to face constitutional challenges in court.

(Photo Illustration by Justin Sullivan | Getty Images)I’ll hand it to West Virginia lawmakers for being on the forefront of a national movement during the recent legislative session, and educating me while doing so. I hadn’t thought much about artificial food dyes, or problems associated with them, until a bill to ban them started gaining traction in February. 
The synthetic dyes have been a target of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the Make America Healthy Again movement because they are petroleum-based and have been linked to adverse effects in children. 
The dyes are found in a range of foods particularly marketed to children, including cereals, candies and drinks. Growing up, I recall often, while bored, reading the nutrition labels as I ate, despite not really understanding the ingredients I saw. 
Following the legislation’s passage and considering what comes next, Del. Adam Burkhammer said, “we need to look at everything.” 
If that’s true, I encourage people under the Make America Healthy Again umbrella and West Virginia lawmakers to consider ways to address toxins that we’ve known for a long time are harmful and have been hurting West Virginians. 
Take lead poisoning, for example. Lead can be found in soil and in some pipes that pump our drinking water. It also was used in paint before 1978. Much of the housing stock in Appalachia is old, and old chipped paint and dust poses a big risk to toddlers.
There’s no safe level for lead exposure. It can cause behavior problems and mental defects in children. One way to know where lead is a problem is to screen children. And we’re not doing that enough.
Back in 2021, Clarksburg saw a sharp increase in the number of children who had high lead exposure, likely due to lead service lines. In a presentation on the state’s response, the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources said low screening rates and lack of awareness about the harms of lead poisoning were challenges. They recommended that the state incentivize lead screenings and formulate a state action plan. 
The Biden administration finalized a rule to require utilities to conduct an inventory of water lines, and to replace ones made of lead. This will be hard work; home and business owners can be hard to reach. Then, typically the utility will be on the hook for replacing the lead pipe up to the home. The owner would have to replace the pipes in the home, which can be costly. 
Where do policymakers fit into this? The Legislature could allocate more funding to health departments to create and implement lead action plans, including intense screening outreach and education. The state could also identify ways to create (and actually put money into) a fund to help homeowners replace their lead pipes. 
This lead example has taken a lot of space. So I’ll spare the reader similar explanations on other environmental and public health issues that come to mind where I think common ground can be found with the MAHA movement. Those are:

Power plant arsenic and mercury emissions that seep into water
Groundwater pollution from oil and gas drilling, transportation spills, and manufacturing
Air pollution for people who live near factories, plants, major roadways
Tobacco use
Black lung disease and other workplace injuries and illnesses
PFAS, or forever chemical, contamination (which the state did take action on, but unfortunately has been put on pause thanks to the Trump administration) 

I hope food dyes are just a start.

(Nigell Moses/Verite)Under a bill moving toward passage in the Louisiana Legislature, sheriffs’ deputies and other local law enforcement agents could face jail or prison time and heavy fines for failing to cooperate with federal immigration authorities.
The Louisiana Senate voted overwhelmingly Monday to approve Senate Bill 15, which, if passed, would authorize prison sentences of up to 10 years for local officials who do not fully and proactively assist with immigration enforcement.
If Senate Bill 15 were to become law, it would directly conflict with immigration policies adopted by the Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office and, potentially, the New Orleans Police Department, both of which are under federal orders to limit their cooperation with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal immigration agencies.
“This bill, if it passes, would basically say that [Orleans Parish Sheriff] Susan Hutson would be in criminal malfeasance in office,” Will Harrell, a spokesman for the Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office, said in a phone interview Tuesday.

Louisiana already has a law, passed last year, that prohibits local agencies from adopting policies against cooperating fully and proactively with immigration enforcement.
Last year, Gov. Jeff Landry, an immigration hardliner, worked with Republican state lawmakers to pass Act 314 — enacted through Senate Bill 208, sponsored by Sen. Blake Miguez, R-New Iberia — which prohibits “so-called sanctuary city policies” that block cooperation with federal immigration enforcement agents.
That’s a civil law, carrying no jail time for failure to comply. But Senate Bill 15, which calls for individual sheriffs and deputies to lose their freedom, represents a dramatic escalation in the state’s crusade against so-called “sanctuary cities.”
“This is part of a national movement to intimidate local leaders from Democratic-led cities that have been more sympathetic or more willing to addressing the immigration challenge in a humane way,” said Sen. Royce Duplessis, D-New Orleans, who voted against the bill  Monday.
Under the bill, it would be a misdemeanor under the state obstruction of justice law to “hinder, delay, prevent, or otherwise interfere with or thwart federal immigration enforcement efforts.” Penalties for members of the public would be up to a year in jail. But the bill would also apply to public officials — even those acting in compliance with their agencies’ policies — who would face up to six months behind bars and $1,000 in fines.
It’s not clear whether that would affect NOPD, which has a policy strictly limiting when officers are authorized to assist ICE. The policy was adopted in 2016 with sign-off from the U.S. Department of Justice, as part of the 2013 federal consent decree over the department. Mayor LaToya Cantrell’s office and the NOPD both declined to comment for this article.
Another provision in the bill is aimed squarely at local sheriff’s offices, which are responsible for operating most local jails in the state. Senate Bill 15 would also make it a 10-year felony, under a state law against public malfeasance, for local jailers to refuse to hold jail detainees past their release dates when requested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Though he did not name Hutson or any other New Orleans official when the bill came up in a committee hearing last week, Senate Bill 15 sponsor Sen. Jay Morris, R-West Monroe, said it is aimed at forcing local law enforcement to comply with ICE detainer requests.
“There’ve been quotes from elected officials that said they will not comply with ICE,” Morris said in a judiciary committee meeting earlier this month.
Morris did not respond to an interview request.
Except for a few limited circumstances where a detainee is accused of a particularly serious crime, complying with such requests is currently prohibited by an Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office policy adopted more than a decade ago as part of a legal settlement. The state recently asked a federal judge to rule the policy unlawful and order it dissolved. The judge has yet to rule on the request.
In a December interview with Fox 8 News, Hutson was quoted saying that while she intends to comply with the law, she “cannot do ICE’s work … It’s too big of a load.”
During Senate floor debate Monday, Duplessis and Sen. Regina Barrow, D-Baton Rouge, expressed concern over the apparent conflict between Hutson’s obligations under state law and the court settlement.
Responding to those concerns on Monday, Morris said OPSO offered up an amendment that would carve out an exception for government agencies under federal consent orders that limit their compliance with ICE. That amendment was introduced by Sen. Barrow. Morris said he discussed the exception with state Attorney General Liz Murrill — also an immigration hardliner — and decided it would “gut the bill.”
Senate Bill 15 passed without the amendment by a vote of 28-10. It has been transferred to the state House of Representatives for debate. As of Wednesday afternoon, it had not yet been scheduled for a House committee hearing.
While in committee last year, Miguez said that Senate Bill 208 would not conflict with federal consent orders in Orleans Parish. However in February, Murrill petitioned in legal filings to become part of the long-settled 2011 federal civil rights case in an effort to toss the consent judgement and the OPSO policy, claiming that they are now in direct conflict with the newly passed state law. A federal court in New Orleans is considering whether to allow the state to become a party to the case.

(photo: Greg Childress)Melissa Mitchell and her daughter Katherine Mitchell were among dozens of home health care advocates who came to Raleigh on Wednesday to ask lawmakers to invest more in home health aide services.
The advocates say an appropriation of an additional $120 million is needed so that home health employers can keep pace with Amazon, McDonald’s and other corporations that pay employees more than the $14-$16 per hour caregivers earn in North Carolina. Medicaid and other federal reimbursement programs don’t allow them to pay more, they said.
Meanwhile, hourly pay at Amazon starts at $22 per hour, advocates said.
“I think caregivers should make more than Amazon employees or McDonald’s employees,” said Melissa Mitchell, a paid family caregiver for daughter Katherine who has Muscular Dystrophy.
Melissa Mitchell, a BAYADA Home Health Care employee from Greensboro, doesn’t begrudge anyone their Amazon purchases or Big Macs, but believes people who care for the elderly and people with disabilities should be fairly compensated for the difficult work they do.
“It’s a very intimately driven job … and you need to have an extremely large heart,” Melissa Mitchell said. “There’s no value that you can place on this.”
Katherine Mitchell said it’s beneficial to have her mom as caregiver because she “knows me best and knows how to care for me.”
Katherine Mitchell, an artist, said she planned to share tidbits about her life with lawmakers. At home, Katherine Mitchell said, she is surrounded by people who know her and love her.
“I wouldn’t be able to thrive as I am if I wasn’t able to be cared for at home,” Katherine Mitchell said.
Wednesday’s advocacy day event was organized by Hearts for Home Care (H4HC) in conjunction with the Association for Home & Hospice Care of North Carolina (AHHC) and SembraCare. More than 150 people were expected to meet with lawmakers throughout the day to urge them to increase funding for health aide services.
The organizers contend that 51,000 seniors and people living with disabilities are in danger of losing access to care due to staffing shortages. Aides, they said, are being forced to leave the home health care industry to find better paying jobs.
In February 2024, a North Carolina Health Talent Alliance workforce demand survey found that the turnover rate for in-home caregivers was 80%.
“Caregivers will come in and they’re disappointed in the wage, and they’ll start with us but if an agency down the road will pay them 25 cents [an hour] more or McDonald’s will pay them 25 cents [an hour] more, then they leave us,” said Felicia Cunningham, division director at BAYADA. “There’s not a lot of commitment to this work because they’re trying to make ends meet.”
Cunningham and others said an increase to $25 per hour would make a huge difference in recruitment and retention.
“Twenty-five dollars an hour would make an amazing difference because we could compete with caregivers in nursing homes, caregivers at hospitals and the fast-food industry,” Cunningham said.
  Rep. Donna McDowell White (Photo: NCGA)
Rep. Donna McDowell White (R-Johnston) noted in an interview with reporters the cyclical nature of the issues that tend to capture the attention of lawmakers. White said that could mean there’s little-to-no appetite this year for additional funding for home health caregivers after recent increases funded by federal COVID dollars.
“Folks that tend to be at the Fulcher level [a reference to a legislative budgeting term] see things in a cyclic pattern and they might really focus on health care one year, then they’ll focus on another issue another year,” White said. “I’ve just seen that as a pattern. I think this year, it’s not only keeping with that pattern, but it’s also the fact that we just don’t have the resources that we’ve had with all over the extra federal money that we’ve had.”
On the Senate side, Sen. Gale Adcock (D-Wake) said most health care legislation thus far in 2025 has consisted of bills to alter policies and not “money bills.”
Adcock said home health care providers are small businesses and there needs to be a way to help them to succeed.
“I think their [lawmakers] hearts are there, it’s finding the money because there’s never enough money to do everything you want to do,” Adcock said.   
Monica McKenney, CEO of Carolina Home Care, LLC, said one of the toughest parts of her job is telling a new hire how much they will be paid.
“When I have to tell her $14 or $15 an hour, it’s like crickets, everything gets quiet,” McKenney said.
New hires say they can’t work for that amount because they can’t pay bills or put food on the table, McKenney said. McKenney said new hires also tell her that $14 or $15 an hour will only pay for gas to travel to take care of the client.
“It’s frustrating to me and honestly, it’s a little embarrassing,” McKenney said.
Shannon McCarson, regional director of the Southeast and Midwest for BAYADA, echoed those concerns, and said hiring and retaining staff has been a big challenge. McCarson said the home health care industry is losing employees to Amazon and fast-food restaurants at a time when the number of caregivers is declining and the need for their services is growing.
The $120 million request from the state would go a long way toward helping to improve pay for caregivers, he said.

“It just puts us in a more competitive wage range, and it creates more of a living wage for those caregivers so that they can do the work they love to do,” McCarson said. It becomes a win for everybody.”  
Toynia Edmond-Moore traveled from Charlotte to share photos of her brother Derrick Hasan Allen who died in October at age 23. Allen had developmental disabilities and received home care 10 hours per day, Monday through Friday, Edmond-Moore said.
“We would not have had my brother for as long as we did without home health,” said Edmond-Moore.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_4326-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-05-15 06:00:10.706407

In one of my first classes, we visited spaces like AS220 and New Urban Arts, places that showcase, nurture, and invite creativity. The art scene easily stopped feeling like an abstract concept and became a reason this city began to feel like a second home.


WaterFire ‘Starts at Sunset’
Presented by the Providence Tourism Council
The season’s first WaterFire ‘Starts at Sunset’ event is Thursday, May 15.
Programming begins at 7 p.m., including live music and art activations along the Michael S. Van Leesten Memorial Bridge. The five braziers will be lit at 8 p.m. and burn until 10 p.m.


One of my earliest memories here is following a trail of music and light — until I stumbled across WaterFire, flames flickering along the river as strangers became a community.
I can’t imagine what my experience would have looked like if the flames had gone cold. This is why the recent rise of AI in the arts feels more personal than theoretical. The same creative community that drew me in is now under threat. 
Unchecked, AI could limit compensation, erase human authorship and weaken the artistic institutions. Generative AI challenges the foundation of our creative economy. In Rhode Island, a state where the arts fuel both the economy and identity, that loss isn’t just creative. It’s structural. It’s social. 
We must act now to regulate AI thoughtfully, protecting artists’ rights while embracing technology responsibly.
Together, arts and culture contribute $2.2 billion to Rhode Island’s economy and nearly 18,000 jobs. Through traditions, institutions, and organizations such as WaterFire Providence, AS220, and the RISD museum, creative capital drives commerce, education, and tourism. 
WaterFire, a public art installation of fire statues across three downtown Providence rivers, provides major economic benefits. The fires attract around 1 million attendees every year, serving to fill local restaurants and hotels. These free events generate an estimated $12 million to $15 million in tax revenue for Rhode Island, and stand as living proof that art is legitimate economic fuel. 










The recent rise of AI in the arts feels more personal than theoretical. The same creative community that drew me in is now under threat. 


A few blocks away, AS220 is an artist-run organization that invests in affordable creative space. Each year the organization supports 1,000 local artists and draws upwards of 90,000 people to its events. Further, in the past year, the RISD Museum brought nearly 120,000 visitors and hosted hundreds of educational programs for schools and the public.
Enter generative AI, a modern challenge to Rhode Island’s embedded creativity. AI art tools can learn and grow from existing artist’s works without permission or pay. Local creatives worry their livelihoods could be the next casualty of unchecked, unregulated automation. 
Griffin Smith, a digital art instructor at the Rhode Island School of Design, warns that AI could “eliminate a ‘middle class’ of designers and freelance artists” as algorithms begin to replace local talent. 
This isn’t a hypothetical fear. Nationally, the Brookings Institution has identified creative jobs, especially in design, writing, music, and video production, as among the most vulnerable to AI-driven automation. A McKinsey report predicts that by 2030, as many as 30% of creative and media jobs could be displaced without meaningful regulation. In states like Rhode Island, where small arts organizations and independent creators keep entire neighborhoods alive, the consequences won’t just be artistic, but social. 
We can’t stop innovation, change, or progress. And we shouldn’t try to. What we can do is channel new technologies with foresight. We need thoughtful regulation of AI to preserve the creative economy Rhode Islanders have built. 
First, copyright laws must catch up by requiring artists’ consent before companies use their work to train AI, preventing labor extraction. 
Second, ensure transparency. AI-generated art and content should be clearly labeled so consumers know the origin of the work. By protecting artists’ intellectual property we preserve trust in the creative industries. 
Third, lead by example. Rhode Island’s leaders, politicians, and companies should discourage art built solely by AI in public programs and promote technology that enhances and assists rather than replaces human creativity. 
Providence is the “Creative Capital” for a reason. Not because of algorithms, but because of our people. Let’s not risk our identity, our economy, or our communities, a protection that demands public pressure.

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)A recent study provided further evidence that living near oil and gas wells in Colorado isn’t safe.
The study, led by Dr. Lisa McKenzie of the Colorado School of Public Health, demonstrated that children who were diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, a type of cancer, were more likely than children without cancer to live within 8 miles of a well site. The finding aligned with earlier studies that have shown that the risk of cancer is much greater for people who live near oil and gas operations.
It also added weight to a conclusion that is increasingly unavoidable: A landmark state law adopted in 2019 that was supposed to protect the public from oil and gas development is failing.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The law brought about a long overdue mission change to oil and gas regulation in Colorado. The state’s previous official position was that its role was to “foster” oil and gas development. But, with the passage of Senate Bill 19-181, its new position was that its role is to “regulate” oil and gas development “in a manner that protects public health, safety, and welfare, including protection of the environment and wildlife resources.”
This was supposed to be an official pledge to protect residents who are at risk of illness or death due to exposure to emissions, who live near operations where spills and other accidents might occur, and against environmental degradation, including from climate change. Colorado was supposed to take the side of residents, not a polluting industry. It was supposed to serve the people, not corporations, and protect the environment, not profits. 
The state has not fulfilled that commitment.
“Unfortunately, not a lot has changed,” said Micah Parkin, executive director of 350 Colorado, which works for climate solutions and environmental justice. “They’re still fracking right by and underneath communities.”
She pointed to the recent approval, by regulators on the Colorado Energy and Carbon Management Commission, of a plan for an enormous, 156-well oil and gas development in Arapahoe County adjacent to neighborhoods, schools and the Aurora Reservoir, a drinking water supply. Community members organized intense, persistent protests against the plan, but the ECMC was unswayed.
This is a pattern. There are already more than 46,000 producing wells in the state, and every year Colorado regulators grant permits for many hundreds more. Denials are rare. The rate of oil and natural gas production has remained roughly steady since 181’s passage, and there’s every reason to believe — given apparent regulatory capture at the state level, the existence of untapped resources in Colorado, and industry rhetoric — that production will only increase in the coming years. Oil and gas production is the single biggest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions in Colorado, according to state data.
How is any of this protective of public health and the environment?










I mean, it just seems like common sense. You don't keep digging the hole when you're already deep in it.


– Micah Parkin, of 350 Colorado


As industry has steamrolled new regulatory provisions, emissions have increasingly exposed Coloradans to health risks. The Front Range region has failed to meet Environmental Protection Agency ozone standards for decades, and ozone pollution — which is linked to asthma, lung disease, bronchitis, congestive heart failure and other conditions — is now so bad the state is officially in “severe nonattainment” of the standards. Oil and gas production is one of the state’s top contributors of ozone “precursors.”
It’s also a major source of benzene pollution. Benzene, associated with a higher risk of cancer and other adverse health effects, was recently found in concentrations that were 10 times above federal standards miles away from the site of a well blowout in Weld County last month. 
The biggest threat of all — to Colorado and the world — is climate change, which is caused largely by combustion of fossil fuels like those being pumped out of the Colorado ground. It wasn’t until last year that state regulators got around to considering oil and gas rules that might account for the industry’s “cumulative impacts,” including on the climate. But the final rule fell far short of meaningful new protections.
As oil and gas production increasingly threatens Coloradans, residents might wonder how regulators can justify the approval of even a single new permit to drill.
“If their mission truly had changed, and they were considering public health, safety, welfare and the environment and prioritizing those things, they wouldn’t be permitting any more until we were on track to meet our climate goals, and we were on track to not be in nonattainment for ozone,” Parkin said. “I mean, it just seems like common sense. You don’t keep digging the hole when you’re already deep in it.”
Yes, that’s the view of an environmental advocate. But it’s also a view that’s implied by the plain language of state law.

Gov. Glenn Youngkin paused over $600 million in funding requests for 10 renovation and expansion projects at Virginia’s higher education institutions to prepare for possible statewide repercussions stemming from uncertainty about the country’s economic future.
As President Donald Trump’s administration continues slashing federal spending and programs and overhauling global trade policies, Youngkin and lawmakers are keeping a keen eye on the state’s purse strings. 
On May 2, the governor announced that Virginia will retain $900.4 million from its budget, leaving a projected $3.2 billion surplus as a cushion. Of the $900 million removed from the state spending plan, $626 million would have been allocated to cover 10 one-time capital projects at Virginia’s colleges and universities.

“While the 10 new projects included in the 2025 Higher Education Capital Outlay Pool are each worthy investments, it would not be financially prudent for me to advance these projects to the construction phase with the current risks to our general fund forecast,” Youngkin wrote in his veto letter. “As chief executive officer of the commonwealth, the conservative course of action is to delay appropriation for these projects.” 
The affected schools include Virginia State University, which plans to renovate Virginia Hall because of multiple infrastructure issues, and Virginia Commonwealth University, which plans to acquire the Altria research building to expand its lab space.  
“The project remains of critical importance and we are hopeful it will be restored at the next opportunity,” a VCU spokesperson said in a statement to the Mercury.
The governor said he plans to reintroduce the projects in his December budget proposal “should the revenues required to support their construction continue to be available.”
In his veto letter, Youngkin said the commonwealth has spent 17%, or $551 million, of its $3.2 billion in authorized capital outlay projects at Virginia’s public institutions of higher education. 
The Virginia Community College System (VCCS) is also among the institutions that now must wait for their projects to proceed. VCCS plans to renovate Amherst and Campbell Halls at Central Virginia Community College (CVCC) in Lynchburg, which are the core classroom spaces for the college. Amherst Hall was built in 1968 and Campbell Hall was completed in 1974. Neither has had a significant renovation since then.


Federal fallout
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and
whether to make up the difference.

Susan Pollard, a VCCS spokeswoman, said in a statement that CVCC is currently in the planning and design phase for both buildings and is using a limited amount of other available resources to continue moving forward until state funds may become available.
“Virginia’s Community Colleges are positioned well in the near term to navigate what we understand is a temporary postponement to the impacted higher education capital outlay budgets,” Pollard said in a statement to the Mercury. “We understand that difficult decisions regarding the reallocation of budgets are necessary at times, and we are hopeful funding will be restored as the situation allows.”

Maine’s new energy-efficiency plan is projected to lower electricity bills for the state’s residents — even those who don’t directly benefit from its rebate and incentive programs.
The plan, set to go into effect in July, is heavily focused on getting electric heat pumps in as many homes as possible. It comes as other states debate rolling backefficiency programs funded by utility customers as a short-term fix to rising energy prices. Maine’s strategy takes the opposite approach: It leverages investments in efficiency and electrification to lower rates for everyone.
This is bucking the trend,” said Michael Stoddard, executive director of Efficiency Maine Trust, the agency that administers the state’s energy-efficiency plans. ​“ This is our pathway to managing electricity prices while also transitioning the consumers of our state to the highest-efficiency, lowest-polluting equipment that is available.”
Maine has been an aggressive adopter of home heat pumps in recent years. In 2019 , the state set the goal of deploying 100 ,000 heat pumps by 2025 , a target it blew by two years ahead of schedule. The state now aims to get another 175 ,000 heat pumps up and running by 2027 . Maine is also a member of a five-state coalition that is collaborating to boost heat pump adoption, lower prices, and train installers throughout New England.
The state’s new energy-efficiency plan is geared toward continuing this progress. It is centered largely on the idea of ​“ beneficial electrification,” a somewhat jargony term that refers to switching from fossil fuels to electricity wherever the move would save money and cut emissions. There are plenty of opportunities to make that swap in Maine, where roughly half of households keep warm with heating oil, which can be pricey and inefficient.
Over the next three years, the incentives in the plan are forecast to support 38 ,000 new whole-home residential heat pump systems — including 6 ,500 in low-income households — and weatherization for 9 ,900 houses. A low-income household can get rebates of up to $9 ,000 for heat pump installations, and homes at high income levels qualify for up to $3 ,000 . The incentives do not offer any money for residential fossil-fuel-burning equipment.
This strategy should decrease annual heating costs by more than $1 ,000 each for homes that switch to heat pumps from oil, propane, or electric baseboard heat, but it is also expected to lower electricity prices across the board, Stoddard said. Efficiency Maine Trust estimates the plan will suppress electricity rates by more than $490 million over the long term.
How? Utilities have certain fixed costs, such as maintaining power lines. To pay for them — and this is a bit of a simplification — they essentially divide the expense by the amount of power they expect customers to use in a year, and add that number to the rate they charge per kilowatt-hour. When more heat pumps come online, power demand goes up, so the fixed costs are spread out over more kilowatt-hours, lowering bills for the average consumer.

Accomplishing that effect depends on finding ways to make sure much of the added demand occurs during off-peak hours, when there is plenty of room for more power to flow along the lines without building out more infrastructure and thus increasing the utilities’ fixed costs. To achieve this timing, Maine’s plan includes demand-response programs that pay consumers for using less energy at peak times, an incentive for low-income residents to buy electric vehicles with chargers that can be set to work at off-peak times, and other measures.
We’ve already invested a lot of money in the grid, and yet it sits largely unused for many hours of the day,” Stoddard said. ​“ If we can find ways to manage consumption so that it is occurring during off-peak periods, then it will maximize the use of the grid infrastructure and spread the fixed costs of the utility across many more kilowatt-hours.”
Maine’s plan also includes an innovative program that calls for Efficiency Maine Trust to negotiate with retailers and distributors for discounted prices on electric water heaters and for agreements to keep the equipment in stock. The strategy is particularly effective at getting people to switch from fossil-fuel water heaters in moments when their old equipment has failed and they are searching for an affordable, easily available replacement, said Erin Cosgrove, director of policy and programs for the nonprofit Northeast Energy Efficiency Partnerships.
This program is unique for the Northeast,” she said.
More states have prioritized electrification in their efficiency programs in recent years, said Mark Kresowik, senior policy director for the research group American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. Massachusetts, for example, phased out its incentives for oil and gas equipment last year, and Washington, D.C., has also eliminated rebates for fossil-fuel-powered systems and appliances.
What a lot of programs across the country are doing is recognizing that providing incentives for fossil-fuel-based systems doesn’t achieve their goals,” he said. ​“ Most of the leading states are prioritizing efficient electric appliances like heat pumps going forward.”
Energy-efficiency programs have traditionally centered the big-picture goal of helping consumers lower their energy use to save money and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, whether that energy comes from an oil-delivery truck, a natural gas pipe, or over power lines.
Amid rising concern about climate change, however, more states have looked for ways to amplify the emissions impact of their programs. The solution has been to limit or eliminate incentives for fossil-fuel equipment and lean into electrification, which can often save consumers money and almost always reduce the emissions associated with heating and cooling their homes.
When you use those additional metrics, you realize some of those old measures don’t make sense anymore,” Kresowik said.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-1934748893-scaled-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-15 06:00:10.706407

For the last year, South Carolina has stood alone as the only state without laws protecting victims of nonconsensual distribution of intimate images, or NDII. That’s finally changing.
Virginia could lead the way on strengthening privacy laws regarding intimate images

HB3058 unanimously passed the state Legislature and became law Monday with Gov. Henry McMaster’s signature, marking a crucial step forward in protecting South Carolinians from image-based sexual abuse and aligning our laws with the rest of the country.
This legislation has been years in the making. Previous bills failed to gain traction. But now, we have a law that not only protects survivors, but it also defends our democracy by addressing a new barrier to public participation: the fear of digital exposure.
Distributing intimate images without consent, sometimes called “revenge porn,” is a growing form of digital-age sexual violence.
Today, millions of people store private moments on phones or in the cloud.
In 2000, just 2.7% of adults reported sending sexually explicit images. By 2023, that number had soared to nearly 77%. This shift reflects the reality of modern relationships — but it also reveals how vulnerable we’ve become in a world where your digital history can be weaponized.
For those seeking to serve their communities — especially young people and women — this vulnerability carries a heavy cost.
In an age where sharing intimate images is common, the fear that a private moment from the past could resurface can be enough to deter someone from running for office or stepping into public life.
And it’s not just fear — it’s a rational calculation. Women, in particular, face harsher scrutiny and stigma when private images are leaked or misused.
This isn’t just about individual harm. It’s about who gets to participate in democracy.
If personal privacy can be used to shame people out of the public arena, we risk creating a political culture that only welcomes those with the least to lose. That often means excluding young people, women, people of color, and anyone whose digital history doesn’t fit a narrow standard of respectability.
That’s not democracy. That’s silence.
We’ve seen this before in different forms: gatekeeping disguised as moral judgment.
From criticizing women’s clothing to shaming single mothers or discrediting candidates based on their identities, the underlying message has often been that only certain people are deemed worthy of leadership.
The distribution of intimate images is a modern extension of that same exclusion, now supercharged by technology.
The consequences are especially dire for young leaders. Digital life begins early now. Teens and college students grow up with smartphones and social media. Decisions made in adolescence can follow them forever.
When these decisions are turned into ammunition for harassment, it sends the message that leadership is only for the flawless. That excludes most of us.
This new law helps turn the tide. It establishes penalties based on the harm caused. When intimate images are shared with intent to cause emotional, reputational, or financial harm — or for financial gain — the act is a felony. When there’s no intent to harm, it’s classified as a misdemeanor.
This ensures the punishment fits the offense while sending a clear message: image-based abuse is a serious crime.
More importantly, this bill affirms that no one should be disqualified from public life because of their digital life or a violation of privacy. We must build a society where people are safe not just from violence, but from being silenced or shamed into invisibility.
Protecting privacy is essential to protecting participation.
By passing this bill, South Carolina is standing up for survivors — and for a future where every person can engage in public life without fear.
But the work doesn’t end here. We must ensure the law is implemented effectively, educate the public about it, and continue advocating for policies that reflect the realities of the digital age.
HB3058 is more than a legal win. It’s a democratic one.
South Carolina is saying that dignity, privacy, and the right to serve belong to everyone — not just those whose pasts remain unseen.",https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Getty_cellphone-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-15 06:00:10.706407

Getty Images.A proposed bill would require Ohio school districts to have a moment of silence every day. 
Ohio state Reps. Gary Click, R-Vickery, and Eric Synenberg, D-Beachwood, gave sponsor testimony on House Bill 187 Tuesday during the House Education Committee. 
State law currently allows teachers to have a moment of silence in the classroom, so this bill would change one word in the law — from may to shall, creating a new mandate. The bill leaves the implementation up to the teacher. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“This bill does not ask for much and is extremely non-prescriptive,” Click said in his sponsor testimony. “It does not say where, when, or how long. It just says simply a moment. … Mindfulness is becoming a lost art in the hustle and bustle of modern society and is a discipline worth teaching.”
Students are constantly being bombarded with technology, Synenberg said. 
“While we as lawmakers can’t solve every mental health challenge students face, we do have the ability to create a space for a brief opportunity of peace and quiet,” he said. 
Students have the right to leave the classroom if they do not wish to participate in the moment of silence under the bill, but Synenberg said the legislation can’t prevent a student who chooses not to participate from getting bullied or made fun of. 
“That will have to be dealt with on an individual basis by the teachers (and) administration at school,” he said. “Hopefully, students are not going to do that. I’m sure it could happen, but we unfortunately can’t prevent that.”
Lawmakers on the committee had a lively discussion weighing the pros and cons of the bill. 
“We’ve been having a lot of discussion in the committee so far about how to roll back some of the mandates and regulations in our schools, and obviously this one says shall, as opposed to may,” Education Committee Chair Rep. Sarah Fowler Arthur, R-Ashtabula, said. “So how do you propose that fits into the context of trying to be less burdensome and not adding costs to the local districts?”
Click responded by saying there would be no cost to this bill. 
“This could be defined as a mandate,” Synenberg said. “It is sort of an anti-mandate mandate. So it’s do this, but really what we are having you do is for a small part of the day telling you don’t have to teach, you don’t have to instruct, you don’t have to be disciplining students. You’ll just be present with your students for that time.”
State Rep. Beryl Brown Piccolantonio, D-Gahanna, asked what currently prevents a school from having a daily moment of silence? 
“There’s nothing that prevents them,” Click said. “And yet, for some reason, not everyone does, and we just think it would be a good practice to implement across the state in every school.”
State Rep. Sean Patrick Brennan, D-Parma, said he would occasionally do a moment of silence in his classroom. 
“In today’s day and age — with the mental health crisis that we have on our hands — I think it’s wise,” he said. 
Brennan asked the lawmakers how having a daily moment of silence could help students foster mindfulness, empathy, and gratitude.
“I don’t know if our young people are consistently taught the value of just being still,” Click said. “I think that is a discipline that is worth teaching, and some teachers might want to expand on that and teach their students how to meditate.”
Ohio’s new religious release time law — which passed during the last General Assembly — also changed one word in the law from may to shall, requiring school districts to come up with a religious release time policy. Click sponsored a religious release time bill and language from that bill was eventually added to another education bill that was later signed into law by Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine earlier this year.

Few initiatives of modern American conservatives have been more successful than the crusade to take control of the courts. From the U.S. Supreme Court on down, big dollars and a commitment to hardball politics have helped give Republicans large majorities on several courts where the partisan divide should be about even.
Notably, however, Republican Jefferson Griffin’s recent effort to overturn his loss to Justice Allison Riggs in a North Carolina Supreme Court election by tossing thousands of ballots, may have flipped the script.
Griffin’s sore loser refusal to concede has angered so many people of all stripes that it’s greatly altered the environment surrounding state judicial elections.
Meanwhile, thanks to her energetic defense of her candidacy and the voting rights of all North Carolinians, Justice Riggs has emerged as a minor political rock star.
The bottom line: Things can still change quickly, but for now, Democrats’ chances of reversing recent patterns in state judicial elections have brightened considerably. And all those concerned can thank Jefferson Griffin for the shift.

I got a request just the other day from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission to offer my thoughts on revising their rules about using steel traps to catch wild animals.
“The FWC is seeking feedback from the public on proposed changes to wildlife trapping regulations in Florida,” said the agency’s email, dated May 9.
Well, gosh, I was happy to oblige them! I am generally in favor of steel traps when it comes to minds. As for actual steel traps? Put me down as a NO.
For the past 53 years, steel-jaw foothold and leg traps and body-gripping traps to capture wild animals have been banned for use in Florida unless you were one of the few people who qualified for a special use permit.
But now the wildlife commission is considering changes to its trapping rules.
A spokesperson for the agency, Ryan Sheets, said this effort to “modernize” the rules does say that “requirements currently associated with the Special Use Permit process be incorporated into rule.” However, Sheets told me, “nearly everyone would be required to obtain a permit prior to trapping wildlife in Florida.”
The problem is that the permittees would no longer be the small, select professional group that now qualify. Instead, the general public could get one.

“The key component to the rule changes to steel-jaw foothold traps and steel-jaw body-gripping traps is that they will remove the existing ‘Special Use Permit’ requirement to use these traps … which, for all intents and purposes, effectively reverses the state’s ban on steel-jaw traps,” Robert Ruderman of Humane Wildlife Consulting of South Florida said.
The wildlife commission’s talk about “modernizing” the trapping rules is “just a shameless attempt to gaslight the public,” Ruderman told me this week.
I guess you could say that the wildlife commissioners feel trapped — or at least tightly confined — by the existing rules. Now, like any trapped animal, they want to loosen things up.
This loosening of the regulations hasn’t gotten a lot of attention yet, because everyone’s so upset about the FWC’s misguided and unscientific push for another bear hunt. But advocates of humane treatment of animals are paying close attention, indeed.
  Kate McFall via Humane Society of United States
“We’re glad they’re considering an update to the trapping rules,” said Kate McFall, Florida director of the Humane Society of the United States. But her organization is opposed to any attempt to make it easier for people to use steel foot and leg traps, which she called “barbaric.”
“We do not want to put these antiquated traps in the hands of the general public,” she told me.
 Free love and captive wildlife
In case you’re wondering (I sure was!), the use of these traps date to the days when men wore hats made of animal fur instead of ballcaps touting overpriced sports teams or brainless political slogans. Trapping was the preferred way to catch beavers, wolves, and other wildlife used by hatters, mad or otherwise.
A lot of folks these days sneer at fashion news: “Who cares who wore what at the Met Gala!” But the economics of fur fashion drove a lot of the early American (and Canadian) exploration and economy.
  Sewell Newhouse via Find A Grave
Some of the earliest steel traps were made by a guy named Sewell Newhouse, who lived in the upstate New York town of Oneida. Newhouse’s father was a blacksmith, so at age 17 he made his first steel trap using his dad’s scrap metal.
In 1849, Newhouse the trap maker joined a religious commune in Oneida run by an unusual fellow by the name of John Humphrey Noyes. The fur trade was in full swing then, and a history of Newhouse traps says that by 1855, “the demand for Newhouse steel traps had grown to such an extent that the Oneida Community leaders decided to begin manufacturing on a much larger scale, and it became a major part of the business dealings of the community.”
The main thing the Oneida community is remembered for these days is not its trap factory but what happened when they got behind closed doors. Noyes believed he was God’s prophet on Earth, and his version of the gospel called for the commune members to all have sex with multiple partners. In fact, Noyes has been credited with coining the term “free love.”
“They were swingers basically before swinging was ever invented,” explained the author of a recent book on the Oneida community. Isn’t history fun?
It’s impossible to miss the irony of the commune-ist Newhouse’s life. Here was a man who made a living making traps for animals, but he didn’t want to be trapped into a conventional marriage. He was in favor of free love and captured wildlife.
Eventually the commune got out of the steel trap business. Instead, they became known for making a different metal product: forks, knives, and spoons. Their popular Oneida Flatware is still a big deal today. I guess you could say they stuck a fork in their trapping business.
 Voice of the trapper
Outside of Davy Crockett cosplay, nobody’s wearing fur hats anymore. Instead, the steel traps are now mostly used to protect commercially valuable animals from predators or to catch unwanted intruders.
  Mark Neely via his website
There are about 200 licensed professional trappers in Florida, according to the Florida Trappers Association. One of the most active is Mark Neely, a Navy retiree who’s been in the trapping field since 2005. He specializes in catching coyotes on cattle ranches because “there’s nothing like trying to outsmart a coyote.”
Neely sat on the technical advisory group that the wildlife commission formed to consider how to change its rules. He attended every meeting but told me he didn’t understand where the staff was coming from on some of its proposals.
“Sometimes I wondered, ‘Have any of these people set a trap before in their lives?’” he told me. “Sometimes I wondered if this person knew what they were talking about.”
Neely was not a big fan of the animal welfare folks on the committee, either, whom he also did not consider well-informed.
“They talk with their hearts, God bless ’em,” he said.
Neely contended the wildlife commission would never get rid of the need for permits for using steel traps. Nevertheless, he said, he’s inclined to favor the existing rules over any new ones.
“If I could do it over,” he said, “I wouldn’t make any changes.”
 Tripods in triplicate
I don’t know why Florida clamped down (so to speak) on the use of steel leg and foot traps in 1972.
This was the era when Congress passed our foundational environmental laws, like the Clean Water Act (1972) and the Endangered Species Act (1973), all of which resulted from the first Earth Day protest in 1970. Perhaps it was driven by that same circumstance.
I bet it had something to do with the traps’ propensity for grabbing the wrong thing — dogs, cats, eagles, panthers, even children. Ten years ago, for instance, a 12-year-old boy in North Carolina got his hand caught in a trap and it took six emergency room doctors to get the thing off of him.
Even when a steel trap grabs hold of the right wild animal’s leg, the animal may be so desperate to escape that it winds up ripping off that limb. Sometimes trappers put out so many traps that they can’t come back to check on what they’ve caught until it’s too late to stop that from happening.
“The length of the suffering is significant,” McFall told me.
The state’s permitting system has limited the number who can use these instruments to about 100 people. But they are still in use and still taking a toll.
  Katrina Shadix of Bear Warriors United via subject.
Katrina Shadix of Bear Warriors United told me that she’s seen not one, not two but THREE three-legged bears in Seminole County, all of them nicknamed “Tripod.”
How did they get that way? The answer, in the words of Admiral Ackbar from “Return of the Jedi”: “It’s a trap!”
 Breaking the law
The 1972 state law that bans steel leg and foot traps doesn’t allow for any exceptions, Shadix told me. But the wildlife commission has allowed their use to continue as long as the trapper applies for a free permit first.
In other words, she said, the wildlife commission has been breaking the law.
That’s why, in 2019, Shadix threatened to sue the FWC over its trapping rules. Shadix is not shy about taking state agencies to court. She recently won a big case in which she’d accused the state of breaking the Endangered Species Act by failing to protect manatees from a major die-off.
Shadix told me that her threatened lawsuit prompted the wildlife commission staff to promise that if she held off suing, they would update the rules to make sure they are more humane. The update has hobbled along about as fast as one of those three-legged bears.
In 2023, Shadix and more than two dozen other people concerned about the humane treatment of wildlife showed up at a commission meeting where the staff presented a report on how they were progressing.
“The objectives for updating the wildlife trapping rules include allowing for all current uses of traps without the need for a permit,” said a memo from one senior wildlife commission staffer.
Shadix and the other the people who showed up for the meeting urged the commissioners to keep the permitting requirement and start charging a fee for it, too. And they suggested anyone using a trap should get mandatory training and licensing as well.
“Let’s definitely do require licensing and training,” said Katherine McGill, who runs 411 Wildlife Solutions in Brooksville, according to FloridaPolitics.com. “I do not understand why there would not be a fee with this permit, just like every hunter and angler and so forth pays.”
After listening to the parade of speakers, FWC Chairman Rodney Barreto said he was on their side.
“I think as we are modernizing our trapping policies and procedures, I think the public’s correct,” Barreto said. “We want to [have] best practices, we want to check all the boxes, we want to be humane.”
If the FWC now makes it easier, not harder, to use these cruel traps, perhaps that should count as another falsehood told by Barreto, who recently denied before a state Senate committee plans to build on submerged land in Palm Beach County even though the Palm Beach Post reported he’d tried to do exactly that.
“Everything they’re proposing is making things worse, not better,” Shadix told me this week.

 Traps for a real threat
The good news here is that there’s still time for the wildlife commission to reconsider.
Sheets, the FWC spokesman, told me the staff hopes to bring its recommendations to their bosses in August so they can vote on them. That’s the same meeting where they’re expected to vote on holding another bear hunt, too.
If the commissioners do vote to let anyone who wants to use a steel leg or foot trap, I have a suggestion. Perhaps everyone who finds this to be disturbing should run right out and obtain one of these traps.
Then, they should bring these traps to the very next FWC meeting. They should set them up all around the table where the commissioners are meeting.
These traps would be clearly marked and checked regularly, which is better than what the animals get these days.
Maybe if they experience what being snagged is like, then the commissioners will do a better job of figuring out what’s humane and what’s not. You don’t have to have a mind like a steel trap to see that.

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)In the wake of President Donald Trump’s executive order aiming to reinstate “common sense” school discipline, more states may follow and expand the authority of teachers and school officials to deal with disruptive students.
The order, signed in April, repeals prior federal guidance that encouraged schools to address racial disparities in discipline, arguing that such policies promoted “discriminatory equity ideology” and compromised school safety by pressuring administrators to underreport serious student misconduct.
In some states, new legislation already is trending toward giving teachers more authority to address student misbehavior.
Shaken by post-pandemic disruptions, some states take a harder line on school discipline

In West Virginia, for example, a new law creates a structured process for responding to violent, threatening or disruptive behavior among students in grades K-6.
Under the law, a student exhibiting such behavior can be immediately removed from class, evaluated by counselors or behavioral specialists and placed on an individualized behavior plan. If there’s no improvement after two rounds of intervention, the student could be moved into a behavioral intervention program or an alternative learning environment.
West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey, a Republican, and supporters say the law empowers teachers to maintain safe classrooms.
“This legislation provides teachers with the tools to regain control of the classroom and ensure safe learning environments for our kids,” Morrisey said at the bill’s signing.
In April, the Texas House of Representatives passed a bill referred to as the “Teacher’s Bill of Rights” with a bipartisan vote of 124-20.
That bill, now sitting in the Senate’s education committee, would significantly expand the grounds for out-of-school suspensions, allowing students to be suspended for repeated disruptions or threats beginning in third grade. It would reverse earlier changes that limited suspensions for younger students. It also would mandate that students making terroristic threats or assaulting school employees be placed in alternative education programs for at least 30 days.
Texas civil rights groups argue that the bill would impose a one-size-fits-all punitive approach, rather than addressing students’ developmental and behavioral needs.
Alycia Castillo, associate director of policy at the Texas Civil Rights Project and a former teacher, said state lawmakers are taking the wrong approach by mandating sweeping discipline policies for a state as diverse as Texas.











Children are naturally disruptive — that’s part of their development.


– Alycia Castillo, associate director of policy at the Texas Civil Rights Project



During the 2020-21 school year, according to the latest data available from the U.S. Department of Education, Black students faced the highest rates of disciplinary action across all categories — suspension and expulsion — among all racial and ethnic groups.
They were 39% more likely than white students to receive in-school suspensions, 70% more likely to face out-of-school suspensions, and 71% more likely to be expelled.
The disparities were even starker for Black students with disabilities, who experienced suspension and expulsion rates far exceeding those of both their white peers and non-disabled students.
Reviving old, harsh disciplinary policies risks disproportionately harming students of color, students with disabilities and those from low-income backgrounds, Castillo said.
“What works in Austin may not work in West Texas,” Castillo said.
“Children are naturally disruptive — that’s part of their development,” she added. “Excluding them only harms their growth into functional adults.”
Restorative justice models
In recent years, some other states have passed laws promoting restorative practices in schools, in which students and teachers work through problems and focus on repairing the harm caused by disruptions or conflict.
Trump’s school choice push adds to momentum in statehouses

Michigan’s 2017 law requires schools to consider restorative approaches before suspensions or expulsions, aiming to repair harm rather than exclude students. Nevada began mandating restorative justice approaches in 2019, but scaled back that approach in 2023.
This year, Maryland passed a law requiring the state to establish “restorative practices schools,” specific schools with trained educators who use the approach in everyday discipline.
Kimberly Hellerich, an assistant professor at Sacred Heart University and a former K-12 teacher, said discipline policies should go beyond punitive measures to foster accountability and community healing.
“Adding restorative practices to accompany codes of conduct can allow students to recognize the impact of their actions on themselves, peers, the teacher, the class and the school community,” Hellerich said.
In her own classrooms, Hellerich used what she called “community circles” to guide students in processing behavior, offering apologies and rebuilding trust. “The apology served as a way to restore the student’s relationship with the entire class community,” she said.
Calls for a cultural shift on expectations
While lawmakers debate discipline procedures, other education advocates warn that an even deeper issue is unfolding inside classrooms: the gradual erosion of behavioral expectations and academic rigor.











Discipline is the backbone of effective learning.


– Jessica Bartnick, co-founder and CEO of Foundation for C.H.O.I.C.E.



Jessica Bartnick, co-founder and CEO of the Dallas-based mentorship program Foundation for C.H.O.I.C.E., said that declining school discipline and lowered standards are quietly undermining educational outcomes.
“Discipline is the backbone of effective learning,” Bartnick, who supports the Texas legislation, told Stateline in an email. “Without it, classrooms become chaotic, instructional time is lost and teachers are forced to shift their focus from instruction to behavior management.”
Bartnick said efforts to promote equity sometimes inadvertently lower behavioral standards and deprive teachers of the tools they need to maintain safe learning environments.
She also criticized lenient grading policies and unlimited test retakes, arguing that they diminish the value of preparation, responsibility and resilience.
“If students are shielded from the discomfort of failure, they are also shielded from the growth that comes with it,” she wrote. “If we want to prepare students for a world that will not offer endless second chances, we must return to a classroom culture grounded in discipline, responsibility, and rigor.”

Gary Hudson excitedly planned a fishing trip with his 4-year-old son and purchased a kids fishing pole in late 2019. He tossed it in the trunk of his Ford Taurus and parked on the street outside his Hartford, Connecticut, home.
Within hours, his car was hauled away by a tow truck. Hudson couldn’t afford to pay the more than $300 in towing and storage fees and asked if he could at least get into the car to collect his belongings — the fishing pole and the safety vest and handcuffs he needed to work nights as a security guard. 
He said he offered to pay $20 but that Whitey’s, a Hartford towing company, told him he had to pay the full amount. “They would not budge, period,” Hudson said. “So I can’t get my work equipment, and you expect me to make money to pay you?” When Hudson couldn’t afford to retrieve the car, he said, Whitey’s sold it, and he lost his belongings. Whitey’s has since closed, and its owner has died.
The Connecticut Mirror and ProPublica have heard repeatedly from people with similar stories. Inside their vehicles, they had work equipment, child car seats or personal mementos, and towing companies refused to give them back.
Connecticut Department of Motor Vehicles regulations say that vehicle owners can retrieve “personal property which is essential to the health or welfare of any person.” But that gives towing companies wide latitude in how they interpret the rule, and several people whose cars were towed said the companies used their belongings as leverage to get them to pay towing and storage fees.
Past reporting by CT Mirror and ProPublica showed how Connecticut’s laws have come to favor tow companies at the expense of vehicle owners. Connecticut has one of the shortest windows in the country between when a car is towed and when tow companies can consider it abandoned and start the process of selling it — companies have to wait just 15 days for vehicles worth less than $1,500. People with low incomes have been particularly impacted by these laws, the news organizations found.
Some nearby states, like Rhode Island, have no law on the books about getting possessions from towed cars. But in those that do, the list of items owners must be allowed to retrieve is often broader than Connecticut’s. Maine allows people to retrieve clothing, car seats, medications and mail. In New York, people can retrieve anything from the vehicle. A bill in the Massachusetts legislature would let its drivers do the same.
In an interview last year, Michelle Givens, the Connecticut DMV’s assistant legal director, said she couldn’t say whether work equipment qualified as essential to health or welfare.
“It’s broad,” Givens said. “I can’t answer that and sit here and say, ‘Yes, that will qualify.’”
So I can’t get my work equipment, and you expect me to make money to pay you?Gary Hudson, a security guard who was not allowed to get his belongings out of his towed car
DMV Commissioner Tony Guerrera said he thought car owners should file a complaint with the agency if they weren’t able to get their belongings out. The complaint process can take weeks, however, which is often longer than the period before a towing company is allowed to sell a car.
Timothy Vibert, president of the industry association Towing & Recovery Professionals of Connecticut, said people can generally retrieve medicine or tools, but he said that part of the law shouldn’t apply if people wait months to get them. He added that when people don’t pay the towing fees, it makes towers reluctant to return their belongings.
“If somebody owed you $800 and they called up and said they wanted to get something out of their car,” he asked, “it’s OK for them to waltz down here and take their things and then leave you with an $800 bill?”
Other towers say they are more lenient. Sal Sena, owner of Sena Brothers and Cross Country Automotive in Hartford, said if someone has keys to the vehicle or can prove it’s theirs, he lets them get stuff out of it regardless if they pay the fees.
“I don’t care if you take stuff out, but I just want to make sure you’re not putting my ass in a situation where I’m gonna get in trouble,” Sena said. “You got the key? Then take what you want out of the car because then I can justify it.”
Connecticut lawmakers are looking to change the state’s towing laws. House Bill 7162, which was voted out of committee in March, would overhaul the law and allow owners to retrieve “any personal property” from a towed motor vehicle. 
The bill “makes a strong effort to identify and correct abusive practices in the towing industry that have had a serious and detrimental effect on motor vehicle owners,” legal aid attorney Rafie Podolsky said in public testimony.
Tow company employees and owners have objected to the bill, saying it would make it harder for them to tow vehicles that are parked illegally or unsafely and that towers didn’t have enough involvement in crafting the legislation.
Transportation Committee co-chair Sen. Christine Cohen, D-Guilford, said during a March meeting that the importance of the issue hit home for her because of “the number of folks” who have told her they got towed and weren’t allowed to retrieve belongings from their vehicles.
“The people should certainly be made aware of their rights with respect to towed vehicles,” she said.
Hudson, who had planned the fishing trip, had to save up to replace his holster, mace and safety equipment for the security job, which he estimated cost him about $1,000. He canceled the fishing trip and said he failed his son “by breaking a promise.”
“It really, really hurt,” Hudson said.
Hudson is one of several people who told the news organizations they lost things they needed for work — tools, chef’s knives, even the draft of a movie script.

Paul Boudreau, a carpenter and mechanic in Hamden, said he lost his entire carpentry tool set worth more than $1,500 when his Chevrolet Blazer was towed from his apartment complex in April 2021. 
The vehicle wasn’t registered because it couldn’t pass an emissions test, and his mechanic was waiting on a part that was hard to get during the supply chain crisis following the COVID-19 lockdown. The apartment complex’s management gave him more time to get it registered, he said, so he was surprised when he looked out his window and saw a tow truck hooking up his vehicle. 
He said MyHoopty.com, a towing company in Watertown, told him it would cost more than $300 to get it back. With his wife recovering from cancer, his carpentry work scarce because of the pandemic and “not a penny in cash,” Boudreau realized he couldn’t afford to retrieve his car. 
Still, he asked multiple times to retrieve his tools and was denied, he told the DMV in a complaint, which included an itemized list of tools. But MyHoopty owner Michael Festa said in an interview, “At no point did anyone contact us or attempt to come down and retrieve any personal belongings that may have been in the vehicle.”
The Connecticut DMV found that MyHoopty committed no violations related to the tow but did not address the items Boudreau said were in the vehicle.
“Anybody we talked to was like, ‘There’s nothing we can do,’” Boudreau said in an interview.
After 18 days, MyHoopty submitted a form to sell the Blazer.
The tows at his apartment complex led Boudreau to become a tenant union organizer. He said state legislators always tell him that when it comes to landlords, their “property is sacred.”
“Why isn’t our property sacred? Why isn’t our car sacred?” Boudreau asked about tenants. ”Wealthy people’s property is always sacred, but poor people’s property doesn’t mean a thing.”
Other drivers lost belongings that held sentimental value — photographs, a sewing project, a prayer card from their father’s funeral.
When Brandon Joyner’s Nissan Maxima was towed from the front of his Bridgeport home in 2017, he lost photos of his mother and aunt that had never been digitized, which he’d traveled with since he got his license as a teenager. He also had shoes, clothing and a car seat for his nieces and nephews in the vehicle, he said.
The car was towed because Joyner owed motor vehicle taxes on it. After a couple of weeks of saving, he paid the taxes. But when he asked for his car, he said he was told it had been sold.
“Everything was just gone,” he said.

(Getty Images)When 1 in 4 New Hampshire residents are rationing or skipping their prescription medications due to cost, we need to strengthen our efforts to make life-saving prescriptions more affordable — not weaken them. Yet that’s exactly what some lawmakers are attempting to do by dismantling our strongest defense against skyrocketing prescription prices. 
The New Hampshire Legislature’s budget proposal, which has passed the House of Representatives and is currently being considered by the Senate, would completely defund the Prescription Drug Affordability Board (PDAB), our state’s only independent, nonpartisan entity dedicated to addressing the rising costs of life-saving prescriptions that so many Granite Staters rely on.
The statistics around prescription prices are both alarming and personal. More than half of our residents (53%) are worried about affording their prescription medications, regardless of if they make less than $50,000 a year or more than $100,000 a year. Additionally, 80% believe that drug companies charge too much money. These aren’t just statistics; they represent real Granite Staters struggling to choose between filling a necessary prescription and paying for groceries or rent.
The burden is particularly heavy on our older residents, who are expected to comprise nearly 30% of our population in the next 10 years. A 2024 New Hampshire survey found that 93% of adults aged 65 and older took at least one prescription medication regularly, with nearly one-third taking four or more. The same survey found that nearly 40% of people in New Hampshire have cut back in some way (food, fuel, electricity, etc.) due to the cost of prescription medications. Skipping critical medications isn’t just a financial decision — it’s a potentially life-threatening risk that can worsen chronic conditions and lead to costly emergency interventions.
New Hampshire’s PDAB, established in 2020, is rooted in our state’s values, like taking care of our own. The PDAB works for Granite State residents and taxpayers — not for drug companies, middlemen, or insurers. 
Since its inception, the PDAB has brought much-needed transparency and accountability to the complex world of drug pricing, which has long operated in the shadows. It is working to identify ways to reduce the massive amounts our state spends on medications through public insurance programs and state employee benefit plans. For example, the PDAB has identified that the state is struggling with the same high-cost prescription drugs now negotiated by Medicare. As more high-cost drugs are negotiated for lower prices, the PDAB could make recommendations about how to leverage price negotiations at the federal level to achieve similar savings in New Hampshire.
In just one year, the PDAB identified $6 million in potential savings for our state. Currently, they are exploring a partnership with a discount card program that could save the state an average of $212 per prescription while protecting patient data and supporting independent pharmacies. Further, the PDAB identified that the state could realize savings by allowing pharmacies to substitute FDA-approved biosimilar biologic drugs; this measure was included in the House budget as a cost savings. These are tangible, meaningful interventions that directly impact our people and our communities. 
Now is not the time to dismantle our PDAB. There is simply no other organization that can step in to provide the same level of oversight and insight into this critical area of our health care system. The PDAB has identified millions of dollars in savings, which far outweigh the PDAB’s budget. To abandon the PDAB at this juncture is penny wise and pound foolish.
The PDAB is our only defense against rising prescription costs. 
Stand with the 53% of residents who worry about medication costs. Stand with the 80% who recognize that drug companies are charging too much. Stand with the only strategy currently available to control prescription drug costs in our state.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/pharmaopioids-1024x705.jpeg,,,2025-05-15 05:00:08.993161

(Photo courtesy of First Solar.)Two Ohio state lawmakers want to earmark $24 million over the next two years to help manufacturers make upgrades. State Reps. Nick Santucci, R-Niles, and Steve Demetriou, R-Bainbridge Twp., argue manufacturing is a leading industry in the state but small and midsize companies have trouble securing funding for improvements.
“It’s essential that we protect our legacy manufacturing companies to support the continued success of manufacturing here in Ohio,” Santucci said when they introduced the bill earlier this month.
Grants themselves are capped at $150,000 and the pool of available funding would be split evenly between companies with 50 employees or fewer and those with 51-500.
“These grants,” Santucci added, “will provide essential support to manufacturers by enabling them to automate repetitive tasks and upskill employees so they can adapt to evolving demands and circumstances including workforce shortages.”
He and Demetriou point to similar programs in Iowa and Indiana that have been running for years. But they’re walking a fine line convincing their fellow lawmakers.
Despite longstanding economic development efforts like JobsOhio and the state Department of Development, there’s an air of ‘picking winners and losers’ to the proposal. That runs counter to many Republicans’ free-market inclinations, and some members worried about blowback if grant recipients crash and burn.
At the same time, Democrats’ ears prick up at that “automate repetitive tasks” argument. They don’t want to pay for business improvements that push existing staffers out of the job.
The pitch
In a lot of ways, what Santucci and Demetriou are suggesting fits neatly with existing state programs. Handing the Ohio Department of Development an extra $12 million a year with specific requirements for how to target and administer that funding isn’t exactly reinventing the wheel. Demetriou cast the program as a supplement to economic development programs aimed at attracting businesses to the state.
“We have a great opportunity to create an environment to organically grow businesses that have already called Ohio home,” he argued.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Even if the funding is a grant, he added, recipient companies have to match the state’s investment dollar-for-dollar.
“In addition to that, the bill stipulates that the business would have to return any unmatched dollars that they received from the state,” Demetriou said. “So, they get $150 grand, and they only invest $75 grand of their money, then they’re returning $75 grand back to the state.”
Committee concerns
Still, lawmakers have a lot of questions about the idea. And to be fair, not all of them are skeptical. State Rep. Heidi Workman, R-Rootstown, suggested the grants might not be big enough. In some industries, she said, that $150,000 grant might only cover a single piece of equipment.
State Rep. Ismail Mohamed, D-Columbus, praised the sponsors intent, but said he’s looking for “a balance” between supporting new technology and protecting employees.
The sponsors’ answers were likely unsatisfying. Santucci chalked up potential job losses to “creative destruction.”
“There’s a creation of new technology,” he said. “Those (old) jobs go away, there’s new jobs that get created because of that technology advancement, and so this is something that Ohio has to embrace. We have to move forward.”
That’s obviously cold comfort for the workers whose jobs disappear, but Demetriou was quick to note Indiana’s program has seen a modest net increase in employment per grant.
Eric Jenkusky, the CEO of T.J. Clark International, testified alongside Jeff Spain who works with a workforce training program at Columbus State. Both are big supporters of the bill.
Jenkusky explained his company has just 16 employees but it has contracts with the U.S. Defense Department for fuel and water pump systems.
“For our company in particular,” he explained, “(the Manufacturing Technologies Assistance Program) would allow us to enhance our manufacturing with modern CNC plasma metal cutting and rapid metallic 3D printing prototyping capabilities.”
Committee chairman, Rep. Thad Claggett, R-Licking County, pressed them about how lawmakers can protect taxpayer dollars.
“How do we how do we have winners — far more winners — than technology grants that did not work?” he asked.
Spain argued the program would be in good hands with the Department of Development. Claggett pressed further on whether he’d support a claw back feature. Spain said he would.
Gov. DeWine lands biggest jobs deal in Ohio history with defense company Anduril’s new plant

State Rep. Ron Ferguson, R-Wintersville, argued a dollar spent on grants is a dollar that can’t go to tax cuts. “What do you think the value is, of say, cutting your tax liability versus giving a grant?” he asked. State Rep. Riordan McClain, R-Upper Sandusky, asked what about regulatory changes?
“Rather than a grant program that spends money, just kind of picks companies to invest in,” he said, “I want to know if we can do it from a from a regulatory perspective.”
Jenkusky brushed off both suggestions. He wouldn’t turn down a tax cut, but reducing overhead “would take much longer for us to be able to realize any benefits.” And he said for companies his size, the biggest challenge is access to capital — not navigating regulations.
“I’m probably going to get myself in trouble for saying this,” he said, “but even with JobsOhio, if you look, it’s not guys like me that’s in that program. It’s always the Andurils and the Intels. It’s never the TJ Clarks.”
In a statement, JobsOhio spokesman Matt Englehart said the organization doesn’t comment on pending legislation, but argued it’s got a strong track record of supporting small and medium sized businesses. As a handful of examples, he pointed to funding for Mansfield’s Ohio Valley Stamping, Milo’s Whole World Gourmet in Athens County, and Warren machining company Buckeye Precision Threads.
“More than 80 percent of all JobsOhio projects are with small and medium-sized enterprises,” Englehart said. But importantly, JobsOhio defines that as any business with $1 billion or less in revenue.

(File photo by Spenser Heaps/Utah News Dispatch)A recent study showed increases in free and reduced-price meals for students, including in Ohio, as some lawmakers attempt to get more of the meals paid for by the state.
The Food Research & Action Center’s study on the reach of school breakfast and lunch programs during the 2023-2024 school year showed participation in free and reduced-price school breakfast and lunch went up 9% in Ohio compared to the year before.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Participation went up nationwide as well, with nearly 12.2 million children participating in free or reduced-price school breakfasts and about 21.1 million children participating in school lunch programs.
“Ensuring that students are well-fed is part of safeguarding the health and well-being of our country’s children and supporting working families in every state,” the study stated.
Schools can provide free and reduced-price meals as part of the federal National School Lunch program and the School Breakfast program, programs that distribute aid based on household income.
Children in households with annual incomes at or below 130% of the federal poverty line are eligible for free meals, and students in households living between 130% and 185% of the federal poverty line can receive reduced-price meals. Students outside of those poverty levels pay prices set by individual school districts.
Ohio lawmakers passed a state budget in 2023 that included free meals for any student qualifying up to the reduced-price eligibility level, but it’s unclear whether that will continue under the new budget, still being decided by the General Assembly.
The Ohio House’s version of the budget kept the governor’s proposal to maintain the standard, keeping students eligible for reduced-price lunch from paying anything. But the House version did not include a proposal from the governor that required each school district that has at least 25% of students participating in meal programs to join onto the Community Eligibility Provision that would make breakfast and lunch free for every student.
Anti-hunger advocates across the country fear that provision might be on the chopping block as the budget reconciliation process continues at the U.S. Capitol, which would impact 280,000 students in Ohio alone, according to advocates.
More than 280,000 Ohio kids would be impacted by proposed national school meal program cuts

The Ohio Senate is deep in discussions on the state budget currently, and two senators are hoping to include universal meal eligibility as part of the Senate draft, something that has received public support from Ohioans in the past.
Ohio Senate Bill 109, which Republican co-sponsor Sen. Bill Blessing, of Colerain Township, hopes to see included in the two-year budget, would appropriate $300 million for reimbursements of public and chartered nonpublic schools to support school meal programs for all students.
Whatever comes of the Senate draft will have to be reconciled with the House draft as the two chambers come together to create a final draft to send to the governor by the end of June.
Overall in the U.S., free and reduced-price lunch went to 1.3 million more children compared to the 2022-2023 school year, according to the research center’s study. It attributed reductions in food insecurity and “numerous academic, health and behavioral benefits” to access to breakfast and lunch during the school day.
“The increase in participation – following a drop during the 2022-2023 school year as the pandemic-era nationwide child nutrition waivers expired – is a strong indication that school nutrition departments are stabilizing after years of facing staffing challenges and supply shortages triggered by the COVID-19 public health crisis,” researchers stated.
The center also noted the rebound shows nutrition departments in schools “were better positioned to implement many of the best practices that increase participation in school meals.”
But the biggest driver of increase, the study found, was the “growth in the number of schools offering meals to all students through the Community Eligibility Provision and state Healthy School Meals for All policies.”
“Offering meals at no charge to all students reduces the administrative burden on school nutrition departments, eliminates school meal debt, reduces stigma and streamlines the implementation of breakfast in the classroom and other innovative service models,” according to the study.
The center sees the increase in participation as “positive momentum,” but also said more participation could be happening.
“Participation in both school breakfast and school lunch by students from households with low incomes is lower than it was during the last full school year before the pandemic, which means that even though participation has increased from the prior school year, these programs have not regained all the ground lost during the last five years,” the study stated.

The Ohio Senate passed Senate Bill 158 by a vote of 30-2 during Wednesday’s Senate session. The bill would require schools to create a policy banning students from using cellphones during the school day. Ohio state Sens. Bill DeMora, D-Columbus, and Beth Liston, D-Dublin, voted against the bill, which now goes to the Ohio House for consideration. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Ohio Sen. Jane Timken, R-Jackson Township, introduced the bill about a month ago. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine was quick to voice his support for it, saying last month that “we need to be sure that our classrooms, frankly, are now cellphone free.”
“This legislation is a common sense approach to unplug our children from the constant flow of distractions during the vital school time in which they are in the classroom,” Timken said during Wednesday’s Senate session. “It will boost in-person relationships and reduce distractions.” 
A 2024 Pew Research study reported 72% of U.S. high school teachers said cellphone distraction is a major problem in classrooms. Students receive nearly 200 alerts per day on their cellphones, according to Statista.
Ohio law currently requires all school districts to have a policy for student cellphone use by July 1. Some schools already ban cellphones while other schools limit cell phone use to only certain times of the day. S.B. 158 would take the law a step further by banning the use of cellphones in school.
School districts would have to ban cellphones in school by Sept. 1, according to the bill. 
“The facts are clear, school districts that have restricted student cellphone use during the instructional day have seen a return to noisy classrooms, fostering real face-to-face conversations and relationships,” Timken said. “Eliminating cellphones in schools leads to improved academic performance and allows them to develop academically and socially and thrive.”
State Sen. Catherine D. Ingram, D-Cincinnati, echoed Timken’s comments. 
“There are distractions, and we need to make sure that when our children are in school, they are learning,” she said. 
There are some exceptions to the bill. A school board can allow a student to use a cellphone to monitor a health concern if the board receives a written statement from the student’s doctor. 
The bill also requires public school administrators to include protocol addressing cellphone use during an active shooter situation in the emergency management plan for each building. 
At least 21 states require school districts to ban or restrict students’ cellphone use in schools, according to Education Week. Florida, Louisiana, South Carolina, and Utah have a statewide restriction.

(Getty Images)I hate how we talk about politics.
This might come as a surprise, because at least part of my day job involves writing about politics in Kansas. But the exposure has solidified my belief that lawmakers, officials, journalists and the general public all could do a better job of thinking about what they’re doing and why.
Our conversation about politics fails at least in part because it’s inevitably couched in adversarial terms. In one metaphor, Democrats and Republicans are two teams fighting for victories. This leaves less-engaged members of the public as passive spectators and suggests that ideological debate exists only to score points for one side or another. Cue the cheers and pouring of Gatorade.
I hate that.
In another metaphor, the parties and their ideological camps fight a brutal war. This has become the favored interpretation recently, as politicians nursing grudges try to crush their opponents through the machinery of government. During a war, both sides strive for enduring victory, and the ends might justify the means.
I hate that even more.
Each of these metaphors depends on fundamentally distorting the nature of governance. The game metaphor depicts statesmanship as meaningless posturing. The war metaphor insists that half of the country (pick your half) has gone to an irredeemably dark place.
In reality, we elect people to public office to make our state and nation better, representing us while they do so.
We can debate the “better,” and we can debate whom that “us” includes, but politics exist to shape government.
For that reason, I think we need a new metaphor, one that doesn’t pit Americans against one another. Perhaps this metaphor could cool temperatures and increase cooperation. Or maybe not. I’m trying to be realistic here.
Regardless, we should work toward thinking of of politics as a neighborhood bar. Not an ominous dive, mind you, or a place for students to pick up one another. No, a cozy neighborhood watering hole, the kind of place called a “pub” by our cousins in Britain or “Cheers” by Ted Danson and company.
If you’re not lucky enough to be familiar with such a spot, let me elaborate. It serves as a community gathering spot. It has regulars. The bartenders know the customers and chat, or don’t, as required. You can visit and read a book in the corner or debate philosophy. You can spend a couple of hours there with friends or drop by for 20 minutes. Whatever you like.
Such bars don’t primarily exist to intoxicate customers. Sure, people will have a drink or two, but the business doesn’t depend on customers imbibing to excess. No, the drinks serve as a bit of social lubricant. Folks might just have a soft drink and check up on friends.
What I appreciate about such bars is that any one person’s political leanings make no difference. The customer might be a diehard MAGA supporter or pushy progressive. Regardless, if you insult the bartender or order too many drinks, you’re not welcome. If you’re friendly and get along with others, you have an open invitation to visit. How you behave matters.
Sure, you encounter some loudmouths. You put up with some cranks. But you accept them as part of the scenery.
Our country would be stronger if we engaged in politics the way people visit such bars. A variety of people come together, with mutual respect. Differences can be aired, or not, depending on how we feel. And everyone unites if something needs to be done. In a bar like this, if someone gets sick or has an emergency, everyone springs into action. The bartender calls for assistance. Others will tend to the distressed person. Still others will watch outside for help to arrive.
You don’t see such behavior just in bars, of course.
You can see it in coffee shops or restaurants that the enjoy the patronage of regulars. You can see it in social clubs and certain houses of worship. You can see it at trivia nights and bowling leagues. You can see it among extended families.
In all of these circumstances, we primarily value one another as people — not as politicians or activists, not as Democrats or Republicans, not as liberals or conservatives. We give one another the benefit of the doubt and wish the best for them and their loved ones and families.
Unfortunately, we live in a turbocharged political world. No one benefits from unilateral disarmament, so extremism spirals. Treating government debates as pitched battles leads to extreme rhetoric and destructive actions. Policy-making suffers, and the general public pays the price.
In my job as Kansas Reflector opinion editor and columnist, I work in this context. That means I often write forcefully, passionately. Real people and their families have become entangled in  the rhetoric. The consequences appear so grave that no other course makes sense. I can’t be the one man sipping a cocktail while others aim howitzers and launch Hail Marys.
I hope that in years to come we can somehow wrench ourselves away from that narrow, zero-sum approach to politics and toward a community-focused, humanistic approach. Such a change would take everyone deciding to rethink our basic approach toward local, state and federal government.
I wouldn’t hate that.

For much of the 20th century, young Americans were seen as free speech’s fiercest defenders. But now, young Americans are growing more skeptical of free speech.
According to a March 2025 report by The Future of Free Speech, a nonpartisan think tank where I am executive director, support among 18- to 34-year-olds for allowing controversial or offensive speech has dropped sharply in recent years.
In 2021, 71% of young Americans said people should be allowed to insult the U.S. flag, which is a key indicator of support for free speech, no matter how distasteful. By 2024, that number had fallen to just 43% – a 28-point drop. Support for pro‑LGBTQ+ speech declined by 20 percentage points, and tolerance for speech that offends religious beliefs fell by 14 points.
This drop contributed to the U.S. having the third-largest decline in free speech support among the 33 countries that The Future of Free Speech surveyed – behind only Japan and Israel.
Why has this support diminished so dramatically?
 Shift from past generations

In the 1960s, college students led what was called the free speech movement, demanding the right to speak freely about political matters on campus, often clashing with older, more censorious generations.
Sociologist Jean Twenge has tracked changes in attitudes using data from the General Social Survey, a biennial survey conducted by the University of Chicago’s National Opinion Research Center.
Since the 1970s, this survey has asked Americans whether controversial figures – racists, communists and anti-religionists – should be allowed to speak. Support for such rights generally increased from the Greatest Generation, born between 1900-1924, to Gen X, born between 1965-1979.
But Gen Z, those born between 1995-2004, has reversed that trend. Despite the fact that the Cold War, which pitted the communist Soviet Union and its allies against the democratic West, ended more than three decades ago, even support for the free speech rights of communists has declined.
 Political drift and cultural realignment

At the same time, some data suggests that young Americans may be drifting rightward politically.
A Harvard Institute of Politics poll in late 2024 found that men ages 18–24 now identify as slightly more conservative than those ages 25–29. Another Gallup survey showed that Gen Z teens are twice as likely as millennials to describe themselves as more conservative than their parents were at the same age.
This shift may help explain changes in speech attitudes.
Today’s young Americans may be less likely to instinctively defend speech aligned with liberal or progressive causes. For example, support among 18- to 29-year-olds for same-sex marriage, generally considered a liberal or progressive cause, fell from 79% in 2018 to 71% in 2022, according to Pew Research.
 Attitudes toward hate speech

The Future of Free Speech study found that younger Americans are especially hesitant to defend speech that offends minority groups.
Only 47% of those ages 18 to 34 said such speech should be allowed, compared with 70% of those over 55.
Similarly, tolerance for religiously offensive speech was 57% among younger respondents, down from 71% in 2021.
This concern over harmful or bigoted speech is not new. A 2015 Pew survey found that 40% of millennials believed the government should be able to prevent offensive speech about minorities.
More recently, a 2024 report by the nonpartisan free speech advocacy group FIRE found that 70% of U.S. college students supported disinviting speakers perceived as bigoted. Over a quarter said violence could be acceptable to stop campus speech in some cases.
 Broader implications

Why does this matter?
The First Amendment protects unpopular speech. It does not just shield offensive ideas, but it safeguards movements that once seemed fringe. Whether it’s civil rights, LGBTQ+ rights or anti-war protests, history shows that ideas seen as dangerous or radical in one era often become widely accepted in another.
Today’s younger Americans will soon shape policies in universities, media, government, tech and the public square. If a growing share believes speech should be regulated to prevent offense, that could signal a shift in how free speech is interpreted and enforced in American institutions.
To be sure, support for free speech in principle remains strong. The Future of Free Speech report found that 89% of Americans said people should be allowed to criticize government policy. But tolerance for more provocative or offensive speech appears to be eroding, especially among young people.
This raises questions about whether these changes reflect a life-stage effect − will today’s young people become more speech-tolerant as they age? Or are we seeing a deeper generational shift?
The data suggests Americans across all generations still value free speech. But for younger Americans, especially, that support seems increasingly conditional.

(Photo courtesy of the Center for Employment Opportunities).When Karina Lariz was released from a California prison in September 2021, she had only the clothes she was arrested in — stretched out and weathered by time. She had lost her home, her car and her job. Her two children had moved in with other family members.
“I didn’t have nothing, everything that I had within those two weeks of coming home was what I found in donation bins,” recalled Lariz, who was incarcerated for three years. She added: “I was so worried about, ‘How am I going to get to these different programs? Where am I going to sleep at?’”
After her release, Lariz spent two days at a motel before moving into a transitional home. She also participated in a job training program.
Then came an unexpected lifeline: direct cash payments through a nonprofit program called the Returning Citizens Stimulus. The Center for Employment Opportunities, an organization that offers reentry support and services to formerly incarcerated people in 28 cities, runs the program.

With the money, Lariz, 35, was able to buy clothes for job interviews, cover groceries and public transportation fare, and begin rebuilding her life and relationships. The money, totaling nearly $2,500 over three payments, helped her gain footing in the weeks following her release — a period often marked by high risk of recidivism and reincarceration.
“It liberated a lot of stress,” she said.
Now, a new independent evaluation of the initiative suggests that short-term aid may have positive long-term effects. The study comes as some states are considering whether direct financial support is an effective — or appropriate — tool for reducing recidivism.
In 2022, Lariz landed a job with the very organization that helped fund her reentry. She now works as a program associate on the organizing team at the Center for Employment Opportunities, where she helps others leaving prison.
Nearly four years after her release, Lariz is married and again living with her two children.
“If I didn’t have that support, I would have not pushed myself to do half of the things that I did,” Lariz said.
She is one of more than 10,000 formerly incarcerated people across 28 cities who received support through the Center for Employment Opportunities’ stimulus program, which launched in April 2020.










If I didn't have that support, I would have not pushed myself to do half of the things that I did.


– Karina Lariz, cash assistance recipient


The national organization works with local agencies to distribute up to $2,750 in cash over 60 days, contingent on participants completing basic milestones, such as creating a resume or attending a job readiness workshop. More than 80% of participants complete their milestones and receive the full payments.
People leaving prison often face staggering rates of joblessness, homelessness and food insecurity. Most program participants used the funds to cover food, rent, utilities or public transportation fare. Some participants also used the money to pay off credit card and medical debt.
“The basics of survival are this acute challenge in those early days of reentry, and then you layer on that sort of the big structural challenges,” said Sam Schaeffer, the executive director and CEO of the Center for Employment Opportunities. “Just putting food on the table, just getting to work, just getting that set of interview clothes is so critical.”
The new study supports that assessment.
Efforts to release prisoners from long sentences draw new interest

According to the study — which was conducted by MDRC, a research organization focusing on poverty reduction — participants were significantly less likely to violate parole than peers who did not receive payments. Within the first six months after release, parole violations fell by more than 41%, with violent parole violations dropping by 64%. The study evaluated the outcomes of people who were released in 2020 in Los Angeles and Alameda counties in California.
Roughly 77 million Americans — or about 1 in 3 adults — have a criminal record, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. That includes records of arrests, charges and criminal convictions. Formerly incarcerated people often face stigma and major barriers in the job market.
They also often return home without savings or financial resources and earn less than half as much as peers who have never been incarcerated over their careers, according to a 2020 report by the Brennan Center for Justice, a left-leaning law and policy institute at the New York University School of Law.
 Legislation and pilot programs

A bill introduced in the New York legislature earlier this year would create a reentry fund to offer cash payments of $425 each month for up to six months for eligible residents leaving prison. The bill has been stalled in committee since January and is unlikely to pass before the legislature adjourns in June.
Some critics say that the proposed New York program is a redundant and unrestricted handout for people with criminal records, and question whether limited public safety funds should support individuals already eligible for state services, including Medicaid, food assistance, job placement programs and housing aid.
“This is just one more element of what is an overall theme by the Democrats here in Albany to coddle criminals and put their priorities over the priorities of victims and law-abiding citizens,” New York state Sen. George Borrello, a Republican, told Stateline.
‘Transformative’: More college programs are slowly coming into prisons

This isn’t the first time states have considered offering stipends to people leaving prison.
Most recently, legislators in Colorado in 2024 and North Carolina in 2023 proposed bills that would have provided monthly payments to formerly incarcerated individuals. Neither bill made it out of its originating chamber, but both bills proposed up to $3,000 in support.
In Colorado, the pilot program would have offered money for basic living expenses to those who enrolled in workforce training programs following incarceration in a state facility. In North Carolina, the proposal would have provided monthly stipends for housing, food, clothing and transportation for up to six months after release.
Similar pilot cash assistance programs have launched in New Haven, Connecticut; Gainesville, Florida; and Philadelphia.
The Gainesville program, which ran from January 2022 to February 2023, had 115 participants. They received $1,000 in the first month, followed by monthly payments of $600. An impact report released in February found that participants experienced greater financial security, reduced mental stress and lower rates of recidivism.
 Potential savings

In 2022 — the most recent year with available data from the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics and the U.S. Census Bureau’s annual survey of state and local government finances — state governments spent $58 billion to incarcerate more than 1 million people in state facilities.
How many inmates return to prison? Inconsistent reporting makes it hard to tell.

Forty-four percent of all state prison admissions in 2021 were people who violated the terms of their parole or probation sentences, according to a 2024 report by the Council of State Governments Justice Center. On any given day, 1 in 4 people in state prison were incarcerated due to supervision violations — costing states more than $10 billion collectively.
Some critics maintain that the most effective way to prevent crime is to punish those who break the law.
“We do not do enough to hold people accountable,” said Borrello, the New York state senator who opposes the bill that would create a reentry fund in his state. “I really don’t give any credence to [supporters’] thoughts on whether or not they think this is going to save money down the road.”
For people such as Karina Lariz, though, the impact is personal and profound.
“I’ve been able to redefine and find who I am today, like the real Karina — not the Karina that grew up in trauma and all the problems that I had before incarceration,” she said.

(Ian Round/Capital News Service)Maryland recorded 746  fewer overdose deaths in 2024 than in 2023, a 29.2% drop that mirrored a sharp decline nationally, according to preliminary data released Wednesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The decline – from 2,493 in 2023 to 1,747 in 2024 in Maryland – continues a promising trend that indicates that overdose prevention efforts have been effective, federal health officials said. The trend began in 2023, when deaths nationally fell 10% from the year before, and in Maryland they fell 6.16%.
Maryland’s slightly outpaced the national decline last year, when overdose deaths fell an estimated 25.6% from 2023, according to the CDC’s annual Provisional Drug Overdose Death Counts released  Wednesday.
While the data suggests a significant improvement, federal health officials say there more work to be done to prevent overdose deaths nationwide – including in Maryland.
“Despite these overall improvements, overdose remains the leading cause of death for Americans aged 18-44, underscoring the need for ongoing efforts to maintain this progress,” the CDC said in a written statement.
Last year, there were more than 79,500 people who died from overdoses across the United States, according to the new estimates, down from the 106,881 people who died from overdose in 2023.
CDC says Maryland, and most of the nation, has had fewer overdose deaths in 2024

“Since late 2023, overdose deaths have steadily declined each month — a strong sign that public health interventions are making a difference and having a meaningful impact,” the CDC said.
It was a shift from 2018 through 2023, when the United States struggled with an increasing number of deaths due to overdoses, partially fueled by the rise in opioid use and increased prevalence of stronger substances such as fentanyl. Other factors included increased drug use during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The decrease that began in 2023 is believed to be the result of greater overdose prevention efforts, such as increased education and distribution of the opioid overdose-reversal drug, naloxone.
The substance leading to the most overdose deaths still appears to be opioids, in both the U.S. and in Maryland.
Maryland’s Overdose Data Dashboard says that through the first three months of this year, from January through March, there were 283 deaths due to overdose. Of those cases, opioids were involved in 233 deaths, with 209 deaths related specifically to fentanyl.
There were also more than 1,393 emergency room visits related to opioid overdose from January through March, according to the dashboard.
While Maryland’s decrease was steep, and sharper than the national average, it more or less fell in the middle of the pack when compared to other states.
Neighboring West Virginia was estimated to have the steepest decline in overdose deaths among states, falling 42.4%, from 1,389 deaths in 2023 to 800 in 2024.
Washington, D.C., also showed a greater drop in its overdose death rate than Maryland. District overdose deaths fell from 635 in 2023 to 396 last year, a 37.6% decline.
Just two states are estimated to have had increases in overdoses last year. South Dakota had an increase of 4.8% in overdose deaths, from 84 deaths in 2023 to 88 deaths in 2024, while Nevada saw 4.6% more deaths due to overdose, rising from 1,400 in 2023 to 1,465 in 2024.

Property taxes are at an all-time high for Marlene Homan in Cleveland.
“When you’re on Social Security, that’s a lot of money,” Homan said of the increase in her tax bill. “And I know a lot of people got hit with a lot worse.”
And with reappraisals and voter-approved tax hikes, it has been pricing some Ohioans out of their homes.
“Where does it end?” she asked.
Due to what Lakewood advocate Beth Blackmarr calls the lack of movement from lawmakers to provide relief, residents are taking taxes into their own hands.
“We really need change, because nothing was getting done — substantially,” Blackmarr said.
She is leading a movement to abolish property taxes in the state, and the Citizens for Property Tax Reform is on their way to getting a constitutional amendment on the ballot.
Click here to read the full proposal.
“Legislators, in many ways, are reluctant to dive in,” she added.
State Rep. David Thomas (R-Jefferson) has been tasked by House Speaker Matt Huffman to help devise property tax relief. The Northeast Ohio lawmaker understands the concerns, he said, but is asking homeowners to be patient.
“I know our members are motivated, it’s just also getting it right and making sure the policy is a good one,” he said. “We don’t want to do anything that’s just real quick or haphazard.”
Gov. Mike DeWine raised another concern about what happens to local governments, police stations and schools if there are no more property taxes.
“I understand [their concerns], but they have an obligation — I think a moral obligation — to come forward and explain how they’re going to pay for schools, how they’re going to pay for the things that we value in Ohio,” the governor told us.
Many schools rely on property taxes for the vast majority of their funding, with some Cleveland-area schools at about 80%.
“There are other ways that this can be approached,” Blackmarr said about funding schools. “SDIT, a school district income tax, to help balance out the property taxes in their district.”
But the advocate said that this movement doesn’t have to hit the ballot.
“So really, this is the power going back to the people?” we asked.
“It is; it’s the power back to people,” she responded. “Hopefully, what legislators will do, is counter with some legislation of their own.”
The state ballot board will decide Wednesday if the organization can start collecting signatures for the November ballot.

Kayla Bartkowski/Getty ImagesThrough most of last week, U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene sounded pretty much committed to a run for the U.S. Senate seat now held by Jon Ossoff. She made it clear how eager she was to run, how much she wanted to be the one to reclaim the seat that in her mind Democrats had stolen. She wanted to wait and think about it over the weekend, she said, but her intention seemed obvious.
Then suddenly, everything changed.
On Friday, before the weekend even arrived, Greene announced that she no longer had any interest in the Senate. In a long, embittered bitter rant on social media, she explained that “the Senate doesn’t work” and that the Republican elite has lost touch with the American people.
“I won’t fight for a team that refuses to win, that protects its weakest players and that undermines the very people it’s supposed to serve,” she wrote.
“Can I deliver for the people of Georgia in the Senate?” she went on to ask. “Can I fulfill my promises? Can I actually save this country from the inside?” The answer, she concluded, was that she could not because her fellow Republicans would not help her.
Greene is nothing if not stubborn, so why the sudden change of heart? My theory is that the only person who could have forced such a change was Donald Trump, and that directly or indirectly, he sent down word to Greene that she would not have her hero’s support.
The bitterness of Greene’s rant, and the language she chose, provide supporting evidence for that theory. She complains about the GOP elites, sucking down booze “at the country clubs and Mar-a-Lago,” and lashes out at what she calls “the political consultants embedded in the White House,” who allegedly manufacture polls reflecting what the elites want to see.
I suspect another set of fingerprints would also be on the knife that found Greene’s back. That would be those of Gov. Brian Kemp. He acknowledged speaking with Trump early last week about his own decision not to run for Senate and about the need for Republicans to come together to support a candidate who could unite the party and succeed statewide.
That does not sound like a description of Marjorie Greene.
Greene seems to have similar suspicions. In her diatribe, she attacks “the ultra-rich Kemp donors gathering last weekend at their elite retreat on luxurious Sea Island to anoint their candidate to run against Jon Ossoff…They’re trying to carefully select someone who can dress up in MAGA just enough to trick the grassroots into thinking they’re one of us.”
“These are the Republicans who see Trump as a speed bump, one they believe they can carefully roll over now that he won’t be on the ballot again,” she said.
Frankly, there’s some truth to that analysis. Kemp’s greatest success as a two-term governor, his most important legacy, is not policy-based. Instead, it has been his ability to keep the Georgia Republican Party largely within the broad bounds of reason, logic and responsibility, a party that is still capable of governing. In the Trump era, it’s a trick that Republican leaders in other states have been unable or unwilling to accomplish, and the GOP has suffered in those states as a result. You can get away with outrageous stuff in Texas and Alabama that you cannot in Arizona and Georgia.
Kemp, to his credit, recognizes that. He has talked of wanting to leave the state and party as he inherited it from predecessors such as Nathan Deal and Sonny Perdue, one-time conservative Democrats who found success as conservative Republican governors. Kemp understands that if Georgia is now a purple state, as attested by its two Democratic senators, it would be much closer to outright blue today had GOP leadership succumbed to the mindless Trumpite populism that we’re now seeing play out at the national level.
Will Kemp, as a lameduck governor, be able to enforce that discipline through the 2026 election cycle? For the moment he seems to have an important ally in Trump himself, but the president is nothing if not fickle.
Just ask Marjorie.

Jill Nolin/Georgia RecorderNo good journalist ever wants to be part of the story, but today’s story is all about celebrating Georgia Recorder Editor-in-Chief John McCosh, whether he likes it or not.
At the end of the month, the Recorder will bid a fond farewell to the guy who gives voice to our daily newsletter, ensures all of our stories make sense and livens up slow news days with quips and anecdotes.
McCosh is retiring after a long and distinguished career in the news and public affairs business that began when he was a wee lad of 10, delivering papers for The Miami News, the city’s evening paper. One of his customers was then-President Richard Nixon’s waterfront retreat in Key Biscayne, known as the winter White House.
Little McCosh’s parents were constant newspaper readers and encouraged the budding reporter to ask questions about the forces that shaped his world. 
“Because Nixon was on the island where I grew up, there were constantly marches to protest all kinds of federal policies,” McCosh said. “I was aware that teenagers, just a little older than I was, were being drafted to go fight in Vietnam. And I knew some who didn’t come back. So I was pretty engaged for a kid.”
McCosh found he was just as good at writing stories as he was at tossing them onto doorsteps. After his family moved to Georgia, he joined his high school paper; was editor for the paper at DeKalb Community College, which is now Perimeter College at Georgia State University, and wrote for the Georgia State Signal. 
He took a break from college to start his first paid writing job at Neighbor Newspapers, starting out as a sports writer for the Clayton Neighbor and later covering the Henry County Commission for the Henry Neighbor. It was good experience, but didn’t leave him with much money in his pocket.
“I was making $160 a week, I was living at home, and I could barely support myself because I was living in Stone Mountain, so I was driving every day from Stone Mountain to Stockbridge, and I could barely support a car for what I was making,” he said.
McCosh finished up his bachelor’s degree and started at the Atlanta Journal-Constitution at the bottom of the corporate ladder.
“I was a copy carrier, but it was basically an errand runner. I would go get the managing editor coffee, and I think the most degrading errand was to go take his dry cleaning and drop it off. It wasn’t even ‘pick up the clean stuff,’ it was ‘drop off the dirty stuff,’” he said with a laugh.
McCosh was soon promoted to clerk on the business desk, and then to reporter for the AJC’s weekly North Fulton Extra, covering local city and county governments. The work was good, but he had bigger goals.
“I got frustrated because it was clear that that was where the ceiling was, that I was going to be thought of as a junior reporter unless I did something different,” he said.
After a brief stint doing public relations at BellSouth Mobility, McCosh moved to the Atlanta Business Chronicle to cover commercial real estate. Part of the job was going down to the courthouse and looking at new deed filings to figure out what the wheelers and dealers were up to.
“It was a revelation to me that you could use public records to find out stuff that people wouldn’t tell you over the phone, that you could look up these deeds, and I guess there still is a Southern sensibility. You don’t talk about how much things cost, but this — I didn’t need anybody’s permission to tell them how much somebody just paid for a piece of property, and in fact I could use it as leverage in interviews,” he said.
McCosh remembered one major scoop in the late ‘80s when he learned Japanese conglomerate Sumitomo had plans to buy what was then the tallest building in Atlanta, One Atlantic Center in Midtown, then called IBM Tower. 
About a month after he published that story, the AJC called him up and recruited him to help beef up their business coverage. The former junior reporter from the outer ‘burbs would soon have a spot in the paper’s downtown office. 
After more than a decade at the paper as a reporter and editor, McCosh worked several jobs in PR and public affairs, including providing communications at the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute, but when a family member in Knoxville experienced a health crisis, he spent about a year up there helping out while working freelance.
Back in Atlanta and looking for a new full-time gig, he heard about a growing nonprofit news network that became States Newsroom, which then had outlets in about a dozen states, from an old AJC friend. Around the same time, States Newsroom Publisher and CEO Chris Fitzsimon poked around looking to find someone to establish a Georgia foothold.
A series of meetings turned into a handshake at Atlanta’s South City Kitchen, and, in August 2019, the Georgia Recorder was born. 
“This was pretty incredible for someone who was looking for an opportunity to get back in the news business, to have somebody say, ‘OK, here are resources, go create a news outlet, and go hire a staff, and you’ll need some computers, so go buy some of those, and we believe in the newsroom concept, so go lease an office, and if you need help, we’ll help you, but if you can do it yourself, find your own broker, go do that,’” McCosh said. 
“This is certainly a great way to cap off a long run doing a job that – I don’t want to say I would have done it for nothing – but there are definitely days where I think ‘I can’t believe I get paid for doing this,’” he added.
Today, States Newsroom has a nationwide presence, running or partnering with news outlets in every state, and it is now the country’s largest nonprofit, state-focused news organization. As one of States Newsroom’s 39 state outlets, the Georgia Recorder relies entirely on the support of readers and donors, and its work is available to anyone to read for free. 
Georgia Recorder: the Next Generation
McCosh is passing the torch to another Georgia Recorder day one-er, Deputy Editor Jill Nolin. 
Nolin is a south Alabama native who has more than 20 years of experience in journalism, including more than 10 covering Georgia politics and policy. Over the last six years, she’s regularly been the one to step in for McCosh during vacations, doctor’s appointments and the like.
She lives in Atlanta with her partner, Brianne, and their two dogs, Edie and Lottie, their cat Malachi, four chickens named after the women from the sitcom “Abbott Elementary,” and thousands of nameless bees. 
Nolin said readers will continue to see hard-hitting news and in-depth coverage of statewide issues from the Recorder, and she’s looking forward to building on McCosh’s legacy.
“We’ll miss John and his daily witticisms and snark, but we’re grateful for the strong foundation that he helped to build for the Recorder as we move into the next chapter,” she said.
McCosh says he’ll use some of his extra free time to support journalism through the Georgia First Amendment Foundation, where he serves on the board, but he is also looking forward to seeing the world. He’ll celebrate his retirement watching a ball game in Pittsburgh with his brother, and a Europe trip and an Alaska cruise are also on his to-do list.
“I know that I leave the Recorder in good hands,” he said. “When people give me a compliment about how much they enjoy the Georgia Recorder, I am quick to deflect and say I hire well. We have a crew that’s been together since March 2020, with the baptism by fire that that date implies, and so I have every confidence that things will only improve.”

Ned Lamont?,"A late-night deal narrowing the scope of a controversial artificial intelligence regulatory bill produced bipartisan passage in the Senate on Wednesday but left unanswered a bigger question: Are the changes enough for Gov. Ned Lamont?
Sen. James Maroney, D-Milford, who has become the General Assembly’s acknowledged expert on data privacy and AI, declined to speculate if the changes were sufficient to avoid a veto of Senate Bill 2.
“It would be my hope,” said Maroney, co-chair of the General Law Committee, where the bill originated.
Until Wednesday night, the dynamics this year were little changed from 2024, when the Senate Democratic majority passed a similar bill on a party-line vote, only to see it die from inaction in the House at the urging of the governor.
Republicans and the Democratic governor had feared last year’s bill was a premature effort to set standards for the development and use of artificial intelligence and that it could hamper innovation and investment.
Sen. Paul Cicarella of North Haven, the ranking Senate Republican on General Law, said the revised measure maintains significant consumer protections while limiting the exposure of developers and users to litigation.
“We want businesses to come to Connecticut, know that they’re welcome, know we’re going to be good to them and not put burdens on them, whether that comes in the form of regulations or comes in the form of fees,” Cicarella said.
With the revisions drafted by Maroney and co-sponsored by four Republican senators, SB 2 passed on a 32-4 vote shortly before midnight, with all 25 Democrats and seven of the 11 Republicans in support.
It was unclear if the changes would reassure Lamont that state regulation would not discourage innovation involving artificial intelligence, a technology his chief economic adviser likens to a second industrial revolution. 
“I just worry about every state going out and doing their own thing, a patchwork quilt of regulations, Connecticut being probably stricter and broader than most, what that means in terms of AI development here,” Lamont said earlier Wednesday.
According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, at least 550 pieces of the AI legislation have been filed this year in 45 states and Puerto Rico. Connecticut is one of eight states attempting comprehensive AI regulation, some modeled after the first-in-the-nation law passed last year in Colorado.
The Connecticut bill passed Wednesday night requires greater transparency about uses of AI and makes a crime of disseminating “deep-fake porn,” synthetically produced intimate photos of an actual person.
But the revisions strike a reference to “algorithmic discrimination.” That had been defined as “any use of an artificial intelligence system that results in any unlawful differential treatment or impact that disfavors” any protected class. It also exempts the use of AI in health care from the bill.
AI and algorithms are used widely to evaluate credit, job and housing applications, with evidence that some algorithms acting disfavorably on names deemed to be “Black sounding,” Maroney told reporters hours before the debate.
“There are real harms that are happening,” Maroney said.
Sen. Gary Winfield, D-New Haven, bemoaned the deletion of algorithmic discrimination, which he described as an important provision to him and other members of the Black and Puerto Rican Caucus.
“I’m voting for this bill, but let’s not fool ourselves. This bill has a glaring hole in it, and it’s the same hole that just about every policy we do in this building has, as a whole,” Winfield said. “But broken people and broken lives are often the cost of business. I just hope we don’t break too many people’s lives.”
Sen. Tony Hwang, R-Fairfield, one of the four senators to oppose the bill, said even with the changes it was premature, rushed and overreaching.
“I am wholly supportive of AI and technology innovation, but it is a technology and innovation in which we need to watch and nurture, not try to watch and over regulate, because it will hurt our businesses,” Hwang said. “We don’t need to be the first. We need to be the best.”
“This has never been about being first,” Maroney replied. “We do want to be a leader. This is about protecting our residents, promoting the responsible use of AI, and making us a leader in efficient governance, as well as supporting our residents and giving them the skills they need to succeed in the modern economy.”
The other no votes were cast by Sens. Eric Berthel of Watertown, Ryan Fazio of Greenwich and Rob Sampson of Wolcott.
Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven, and Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff, D-Norwalk, staged a press conference with Maroney prior to the debate to underscore that SB 2 was a priority of their caucus.
“We are ever more concerned about the wonderful possibilities of AI, but also the severe threats of AI,” Looney said.
Duff noted that not only do congressional Republicans have no appetite for federal regulation of AI, but they are proposing a 10-year moratorium on the states doing so. The Trump administration also has discouraged AI regulation.
“Now, it’s the wild west,” Duff said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_7489-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-15 01:01:09.289143

We require principals, nursing home administrators, and even hairdressers to be licensed. Somehow, hospital administrators are exempt from the individual accountability that comes with holding a license, and patients in Connecticut hospitals are suffering the consequences.
The past few years we have seen many examples of what is now being referred to as “administrative harm” in healthcare. In Boston, Steward Health stopped paying their medical suppliers and a brand new mother died after giving birth because the hospital did not have basic surgical supplies to stop her from hemorrhaging.
In Connecticut, Prospect Medical paid $424 million in dividends to their shareholders and then filed for bankruptcy at Waterbury, Manchester, and Rockville hospitals. At Waterbury Hospital specifically, Yale alleges that noncompliance with basic safety standards contributed to the death of a patient.
In all of these cases, real people with names made decisions to siphon money to shareholders rather than maintain basic safety standards, putting the public at risk of harm and death. While the Department of Public Health can suspend the license of the hospital for noncompliance, none of the individuals responsible for these reckless decisions were held accountable because they don’t hold an individual license. We don’t allow doctors and nurses to hide behind the hospital’s license, and we shouldn’t allow administrators to either.
St. Francis Hospital in Hartford was founded by nuns – members of our own community who cared deeply about their neighbors, took pride in their noble work, and took home zero executive bonuses. Now, many of our hospitals are owned and operated by out of state actors, such as Trinity Health in Michigan and Prospect Medical in California. In order to ensure our hospitals uphold Connecticut values and prioritize patient safety over profit, it is imperative that we license the decision makers and hold them to the same safety and ethical standards as our clinicians.
Senate Bill 7 would create a licensure requirement for hospital administrators that would hold them liable for decisions they make, such as:

A fiscal or operational decision that causes unreasonable risk or harm to patients
An administrative or operational decision that impedes a healthcare provider from adhering to basic standards of practice 
Aiding and abetting a healthcare provider with knowledge that the provider is causing patient harm or practicing outside of their scope of practice

Hospital administrative licensure is self-funding through application and renewal fees. It would protect us and our loved ones from preventable harm caused by unsafe hospital conditions. It is supported by many nurses and doctors across Connecticut who want hospital leadership to commit to the same ethical principles that we do. Above all, do no harm.

The most recent budget cuts to the Department of Education are already setting up the impending school years (2026-2027) for failure.  Since layoffs for U.S. employees have skyrocketed 245 percent, more so with half of the employees of the Department of Education being cut and removed, we are essentially damning the next generation of young scholars.  
Because of the budget cuts, the National Center of Education Statistics (origins of which go back to 1867) is also losing at least 95percent of its staff, which means we are cutting off central resources and information to educators and researchers that require it, as well as “complicating the distribution of funding.”  As of right now, low-income schools and those in more rural areas will be receiving next to nothing, in regards to funds and grants.  Without these grants, or help from the federal government, these schools are going to have an exceedingly hard time staying afloat.  But, there may be a solution to all of this.
It is no secret that the United States is over $36.8 trillion in debt, and this fact cannot be overlooked.  So it is not wrong to believe that many federal programs should be cut, to better our country and save our money —this much I understand.  But instead of cutting the very education that prepares young leaders for the world, how about government office space?  
That may sound odd, but according to various news sources, only “12 percent of space is being used in the Federal Government headquarters.”  The Government Accountability Office or GAO has estimated that a whopping $100-$200 billion dollars could be saved if we disposed of these underutilized government properties.  
Of course, some of them have essential purposes, but do we really require them all, especially when federal occupancy is at such a low rate?  Hundreds of millions of dollars go into maintaining these office spaces which are not even used.  
In prior years, the House Oversight Committee spent $3.3 billion just on furniture alone.  Why not cut this?  We could have saved land, resources, and most of all, money.  And isn’t that what you want?  
Another process that could be cut for the better is producing coins.  Did you now that producing a singular nickel costs 11.5 cents?  Producing pennies and nickels has cost the United States over $179 million dollars,  If we were to terminate or at least lessen the production of coins, we would be saving millions of our dollars, instead of losing the very system that provides our younger generations with the necessary knowledge to survive and thrive in this world.
Mr. President, you are not a student, so you likely cannot relate to those in the younger generation.  You are not searching for what colleges you want to apply to.  You likely are not worried about how much money you can spend monthly.  But we are, especially now.  
Thirty percent of U.S. college students rely on federal loans, but because of these budget cuts they will have to either drop out of school, leaving fewer options for the future.  With the Department of Education gone, discrimination will also no longer be prohibited, and those with disabilities under the IDEA program or Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, such as my sister, will no longer be protected or have the proper support they need to live in our society (which is 15 percent of students, or 7.5 million).  Because of your actions, millions upon millions of students will be losing their education protection; but most importantly, their chance to obtain knowledge.
I will conclude this letter as I began it, with a question:  Who does the government serve?  The people.  And the people do not want to see their education flushed down the drain with no hope for the future.  The people do not want to see their children left stagnant and lost, with no resources to receive the proper knowledge for the next chapter of their lives.  
As a bright student in high school myself, I can confidently and firmly say that I, too, do not want to see my education, the very foundation of my future, crumble beneath my feet.

These actions were sparked by Avelo’s choice to operate “ICE flights” and profit from the Trump Administration’s cruel and illegal deportation practices. Why do flights originating more than 2,000 miles away matter so much to Connecticut?
In a leaked internal memo, Avelo CEO Andrew Levy offered an alarming rationale: the new revenue will mitigate operating losses at Tweed Airport in New Haven. Losses are already mitigated by significant subsidies from the State of Connecticut, including a fuel tax waiver and $2 two million backstop. 
The tax subsidy sunsets on June 30, with no renewal planned – perhaps due to outrage expressed by state elected officials, including Attorney General William Tong, State Senate President Martin Looney, and Deputy House Majority Leader Juan Candelaria. Now, Connecticut Avelo patrons face the knowledge that trips out of New Haven are subsidized on the backs of neighbors ripped from their families, communities, and workplaces often without justification, due process, or basic safety.
Avelo’s promotional materials proudly declare company values to include “Safety Always in everything we do and in caring for one another” and “Do the Right Thing by treating everyone with kindness and respect, honoring our commitments, and being open, honest and transparent.” Yet DHS requirements for ICE flights make a mockery of these values, with rules such as five point shackles for all detainees. 
Flight attendants are routinely encouraged not to make eye contact with or speak to detainees. Staff sounded the alarm that there is no realistic plan in place to safely evacuate detainees in the event of an emergency. Given the shackles, it would be impossible to evacuate detainees using the long-standing airline safety standard 90 second rule. Thus Avelo’s ICE flights will not offer “Safety Always” or the “Right Thing” – and ordinary passengers are not pleased. 
As of this writing, more than 37,850 people from 50 states and 18 countries pledged to boycott Avelo until they break the ICE contract, in a petition organized by our New Haven Immigrants Coalition. Protests have also taken place in Bend, OR; Burbank, CA; Rochester, NY; Sonoma, CA; and Wilmington, DE. At the same time, Avelo seeks $100 million from investors, given projections indicating that cash-on-hand will dip below $2 million in June. It’s difficult to imagine how to run an airline with $2 million in cash, much less who will be lining up at the gate to publicly invest in dehumanization and family separation. 
Human rights experts decry the misapplication of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deny due process, independent review, and court access to detainees. As long as detentions and deportations take place in direct opposition to the law, to court orders, and to standard practice, we will boycott Avelo and resist.

As long as Avelo facilitates the Trump Administration’s practice of detaining and deporting citizens, permanent residents, and people with legal student visas without due process from the U.S. to countries and prisons with horrific histories of documented human rights abuses, we will sound the alarm and choose other ways to travel. 
Once considered New Haven’s “hometown airline,” Avelo has broken with our state’s values and opened a dark and dangerous chapter. This is a choice, and a different choice can still be made. Mass deportations only occur if airlines cooperate. 
We call on Avelo CEO Andrew Levy to remember the heroism of those who refused to be complicit in the crimes of authoritarian governments in eras past, and to follow in their footsteps.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Dozens of Second Amendment and gun control advocates alike filled the Rhode Island State House rotunda, floors and halls Wednesday, many waiting hours to testify on a bill that would ban a wide array of semiautomatic weapons statewide. 
It was also a long day for the Senate Committee on Judiciary, which heard seven and a half hours of testimony on 15 gun bills. But nearly every speaker addressed bill S0359 — also known as the Rhode Island Assault Weapons Ban Act of 2025 — sponsored by Middletown Democratic Sen. Lou DiPalma. Unlike most hearings, Senate staff allowed only a small number of people into Room 313 at a time, and only one row of chairs for people testifying. A Capitol police officer, senate staff, and a stanchion were stationed outside the door to control the flow of people entering the room.
As the hearing rolled into its seventh hour, Sen. Mark McKenney, a Warwick Democrat, subbed in for Committee Chair Sen. Matthew LaMountain, who had stepped out of the room momentarily. LaMountain and McKenney are listed as co-sponsors on the bill text. 
Yellow is color of the day as gun rights advocates turn out to oppose assault weapons ban bill

“It sure would make life easier for us if we could simply make policy based on the T-shirt colors,” McKenney joked after one yellow-shirted Second Amendment supporter pointed out yellow shirts outnumbered the red and orange shirts of gun control advocates as they did in years past. 
DiPalma’s bill, plus companion House submission by Barrington Democratic Rep. Jason Knight, is one of two avenues Gov. Dan McKee is testing this year in an attempt to ban the sale and manufacture of firearms with military-style features. The bills’ interpretation includes semiautomatic rifles, pistols, and shotguns equipped with accessories such as pistol grips, folding stocks, or threaded barrels.

The bills would build on prior reforms passed during McKee’s tenure, like a magazine cap, an age 21-and-over carrying limit, and a ban on open carry of shotguns and large rifles — successful efforts DiPalma mentioned in his testimony to fellow senators.
“Some will say this is not going to do everything. You’re absolutely correct. This is not going to do everything,” DiPalma said. “It’s yet another building block in the framework of gun safety and gun violence.
The push to forbid select semiautomatic weapons is old hat at the State House, but this year things have changed following the April 21 death of former Senate President Dominick Ruggerio — a longtime skeptic of firearm bans who had expressed a possible change of heart in his final months. Now, with Senate leadership refreshed, the fate of the bill depends upon the Senate Committee on Judiciary.
DiPalma said 24 senators have signed on to support his bill, or 64% of the 38-member body, now down one vote to 37 with Ruggerio’s District 4 seat vacant. Another bill co-sponsor is Senate President Valarie Lawson, attended the hearing at various points.

“President Lawson personally supports an assault weapons ban,” spokesperson Greg Paré said over email Wednesday. “She believes strongly in the committee review process and will let it play out.”
Judiciary has 10 members. Committee members Sen. Andrew Dimitri, a freshman Democrat from Johnston, newly elected Sen. Todd Patalano, a Cranston Democrat, and Sen. Leonidas Raptakis, a Coventry Democrat, voiced their opposition to the bill. Republican Sen. Thomas Paolino was mostly quiet during the hearing but has voted against similar legislation in the past.   
“I think it’s drawn confusion because we’re referring to them all as assault weapons, when, in reality, this bill does not really distinguish actual, quote/unquote, assault weapons from handguns and certain kinds of shotguns,” Dimitri, a recreational bird hunter, said during the hearing.
Raptakis wondered if a study commission should be formed instead.
“I don’t know what you would study beyond what’s already been studied. It’s either we agree or we don’t it’s the right time to do it,” DiPalma replied, gesturing with his hands.
Raptakis returned to the proposal of a study commission around 9:25 pm, right before the last five testimonies took the stand.
“Thank you,” a weary-sounding LaMountain replied after Raptakis shared the idea.
Other senators who sat in on the hearing were Majority Leader Frank Ciccone, who is a licensed gun dealer; Majority Whip David Tikoian, a former North Providence police chief who also served 23 years on the Rhode Island State Police;  and the Republican leadership, Minority Leader Jessica de la Cruz of North Providence and Minority Whip Gordon Rogers of Foster.
Opponents take aim before hearing
Senate Republicans and a handful of Democrats took to the State Library an hour before the hearing to denounce the bill. The Democrats in attendance included Ciccone and Tikoian, who stood in the audience, as did Rep. Arthur Corvese of North Providence. Reps. Stephen Casey of Woonsocket, and Deborah Fellela of Johnston stood in the lineup alongside de la Cruz, Rogers, Patalano and gun rights advocates.
“If enacted, this ban would ban most weapons in common use here in Rhode Island, it would be a blatant violation of the United States Constitution as well as the Rhode Island constitution,” de le Cruz said.
Rogers blasted the bill’s reliance on “military-style” features to define an assault weapon, and held up a folding grip for the crowd.

“Same gun, same round, same ammunition,” Rogers said. “but when you put a grip on it forward as an accessory, it becomes an assault weapon.  Does that make it any more dangerous? No. Do we go around banning cars that have chrome rims and spoilers on because they look dangerous? No, we don’t.”
De la Cruz and Rogers continued those lines of argument during the hearing, with both critiquing the bill’s language as overly broad and unreflective of mechanical reality — as well as DiPalma’s understanding of kinetic energy. DiPalma said weapons which would be banned by the bill yield impacts “nine times greater than…from a traditional weapon.”
“The gun has a firing pin that triggers the bullet — the ammunition — that is where the kinetic energy comes from, not the firearm,” Rogers told DiPalma. “So we bring up the kinetic energy and what it does. And I think you were very theatrical last year, or the year before, when that was brought forward.” 
Rogers framed Rhode Island’s proposed ban as a political outlier rather than a national standard. Only nine states have enacted such bans, he said. “That tells me 41 states haven’t,” he added. 
An hour-long expert panel brought sharply divided testimony from both sides, from constitutional precedent for bans to historical efforts to forbid sawed off shotguns and bowie knives. 










If enacted, this ban would ban most weapons in common use here in Rhode Island, it would be a blatant violation of the United States Constitution as well as the Rhode Island constitution.

Jake McGuigan, senior director of government relations for the National Shooting Sports Foundation and a former adviser to Gov. Donald Carcieri, cited homicide data as a reason the bill would be narrowly focused and not accomplish much. 
“If we look over the past 13 years, 0.6% — that’s 0.6%, not even one percent — of all homicides in Rhode Island are attributed to rifles that will be banned by this bill,” McGuigan said. “Why do we need a common-sense approach to address 0.6%?…That’s not a problem, that’s a rounding error.”
Greg Lickenbrock, a former gun magazine editor and firearms analyst with Everytown for Gun Safety, pushed back.
“Those are lives, not rounding errors,” Lickenbrock said.
After experts departed, a wider range of views emerged. Andrew Wright of Pawtucket criticized the measure as racially and socially exclusionary.
Gun control “always just enforces a white supremacist status quo,” he said. “Black and brown people, Asian people, queer and trans people are buying guns more now than they were before. They’re the people who are going to be most affected by their inability to buy guns that match the weapons already in the hands of the people who want to do them harm.”
As the hearing stretched into the evening, more gun control advocates came forward, including Emily Howe of Warwick, former executive director of the Rhode Island Democratic party, and also a mother of three who described the fear she feels daily for her two kids still in school.
“I’ve never allowed my kids to wear light-up shoes because I’m really afraid that one day that will be the end of them,” she said. “If there’s a gunman, my kids will be quiet — but the light-up shoes would be one to set them off and let them know where they’re hiding.”

Danielle Conrad and George Dungan, both of Lincoln. April 10, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen late Wednesday vetoed a measure passed just hours earlier to end a lifetime ban preventing some Nebraskans from accessing SNAP benefits.
The veto of Legislative Bill 319, from State Sen. Victor Rountree of Bellevue, seeks to keep in place the status quo prohibiting anyone who has been convicted of selling or distributing a controlled substance from accessing Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits. People with three or more felonies for possessing or using a controlled substance also are ineligible.

The current law allows Nebraskans with one or two drug possession or use convictions to access SNAP if they have completed a licensed and accredited treatment program.
LB 319 would allow someone to access SNAP quicker if they have completed their sentence or are serving a term of parole, probation or post-release supervision.
Under Rountree’s bill, a person with three or more felony convictions for felony drug possession or use could access SNAP only if they are participating in or have completed a licensed and accredited treatment program, unless a health care provider determines that substance abuse treatment is not needed.
Pillen said that would create “loopholes” where “habitual offenders” could evade treatment.
“Individuals that distribute or sell illicit drugs should not be entitled to taxpayer-funded benefits,” Pillen said in his one-page veto letter. “Any illegal drug users should be required to complete treatment before they receive their third felony conviction.”
Food shouldn’t be a ‘bargaining chip’
Versions of LB 319 have stalled in the past, the most recent led by State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha. LB 319 passed 32-17, and Rountree said the veto wasn’t a surprise. It takes 30 votes to override a veto, but senators sometimes fall to gubernatorial pressure on such motions.
  State Sens. Victor Rountree of Bellevue and Megan Hunt of Omaha. April 10, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Rountree, a pastor who serves on the Legislature’s Judiciary Committee, said the bill is about forgiveness and restoration. He said food shouldn’t be a “bargaining chip” and that someone should be able to access food once they’ve served their time.
“SNAP is an opportunity for them to reenter, get back on their feet, and I don’t believe that people want to stay on SNAP forever, as many times the story is written that way,” he said.
The bill was also supported by law enforcement, Rountree noted. He said helping Nebraskans with past felony drug convictions can restore their dignity and reduce bad interactions with law enforcement officials. At the bill’s hearing, only the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services opposed the measure.
Rountree said the changes would also help maintain family integrity, noting that as a substitute teacher, he saw the power of food for young children.
‘This moves the needle’
Advocates, such as Derrick Martinez, who had previously been banned from SNAP, had urged Pillen to sign the bill just after its passage. In a statement, Martinez said LB 319 “shows that years of advocacy can actually pay off.”
“This moves the needle in a positive direction for not just me but for our state as it works to reduce recidivism,” Martinez said. “This means less of a struggle, less anxiety, less pressure overall for myself and for others who have been banned from SNAP because of past convictions.”

Jasmine Harris, director of public policy and advocacy with RISE, a nonprofit focused on habilitative programming and reentry support, said the legislation would remove “another unnecessary barrier to help people meet their basic needs after incarceration.”
Eric Savaiano, program manager for food and nutrition access at Nebraska Appleseed, said LB 319 also represented a “huge win” for Nebraskans impacted by the “failed” War on Drugs of the 1990s.
He said more than 1,000 Nebraskans would be able to “better support themselves and their households with critical food assistance, helping them better meet their needs and not fall back into bad habits because of desperation.”
Rountree said the bill would let impacted Nebraskans know “their life has value and meaning.”
Second SNAP bill amendment
Also Wednesday, lawmakers voted to modify a separate SNAP-related bill with an “unfriendly amendment” that was resurrected after having been previously defeated.
The underlying LB 192, introduced by State Sen. Dan Quick of Grand Island, calls for an extension of current SNAP income eligibility levels, which otherwise would return in October to lower pre-pandemic eligibility levels.
  State Sen. Dan Quick of Grand Island, left, talks with State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair. Feb. 4, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha made LB 192 his priority bill this session. DHHS, which administers the program, has estimated that more than 4,000 families could be disqualified for earning too much money if the older eligibility threshold is restored.
While the essence of LB 192 remained, State Sen. Bob Anderson of Sarpy County successfully revived an amendment that largely mirrors his LB 656, which would prohibit DHHS from seeking what he called “blanket” waivers that make exceptions to SNAP work requirements, such as living in areas with high unemployment.
Andersen’s amendment this time passed on a 28-8 vote — a contrast from the 22-14 vote that defeated it last month. It needed at least 25 votes.
The newly amended LB 192, on a voice vote, then moved back to final reading.
New work requirements?
Quick, during debate, noted that Andersen’s was an “unfriendly” amendment. He opposed it and said if Andersen wanted to help “strengthen” it, as Andersen said was his goal, he could have discussed it with Quick earlier.
Quick said the amendment “puts barriers” in place for SNAP recipients who already comply with work requirements.
  State Sen.-elect Bob Andersen of Sarpy County talks with State Sen. Mike Moser of Columbus at a legislative retreat in Kearney on Thursday, Dec. 12, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Andersen said his amendment still allows for six specific work exemptions, and is aimed at about 20,000 people who he said were able-bodied Nebraskans currently exempt from work and training requirements.
He said his amendment would get workers “trained and employed.”
State Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln pointed out that the amendment at one point was estimated to cost $2.2 million in the first year and even more in the next. He said a new financial estimate reduced the cost to zero only because, instead of requiring DHHS to help find work for impacted SNAP recipients, it says the agency “may” do so.
Cavanaugh objected to the amendment and said the “permissive language” is “another sleight of hand to put off the books, to unbalance our budget behind people’s backs.”
State Sen. Tom Brandt of Plymouth said he was not opposed to strict work requirements but objected to Andersen’s late change in the lawmaking process.
State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair was a fan of the amendment, saying it could result in able-bodied people getting back to work sooner. As for additional costs, he said: “If the resources aren’t there, they (DHHS) are not going to do it.”

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)The Alaska Legislature on Wednesday approved almost all of Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s appointments to state boards and commissions during an annual joint session of the state House and Senate.
Of the 99 officials awaiting confirmation, the Legislature rejected only two: physician assistant Samantha Smith to the state medical board, and principal Kimberly Bergey to the Professional Teaching Practices Commission.
That rejection rate is not unusual, but one of the votes may have made legislative history.
Smith’s nomination was rejected by a 0-60 vote, something Senate President Gary Stevens, R-Kodiak, called “remarkable.”

Neither he nor any other member of the Legislature could recall a prior case when a nominee failed to receive a single vote in their favor. Stevens has been serving in the Legislature since 2000.
The Alaska Legislature’s library does not keep track of confirmation votes, the librarian said, and a search of online newspaper archives failed to find a similar vote.
Smith did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment.
Speaking during the joint session, lawmakers questioned Smith’s experience and said they had received overwhelming testimony against her.
Smith is a physician assistant at a chiropractic office, and that’s not representative of the work that most PAs do, said Rep. Andrew Gray, D-Anchorage and a physician assistant himself.
Rep. Zack Fields, D-Anchorage, said the Alaska Academy of Physician Assistants, which represents PAs across the state, wrote a letter opposing her confirmation, as did individual PAs across the state.
Multiple legislators said they were concerned about Smith’s performance during confirmation hearings. In one hearing, Smith appeared to violate HIPAA, the federal health privacy act, Fields said.
“The hearings, I thought, were consistently troubling,” said Sen. Matt Claman, D-Anchorage.
He mentioned one example: Smith said she believes the state needs more attorneys able to file malpractice claims against doctors to keep them in line.
“If enthusiasm was a qualification, she has 150% of that. I was a little taken aback by some of the comments that she made,” said Rep. Mike Prax, R-North Pole.

After rejecting Smith, legislators approved Brent Taylor for the medical board by a close 33-27 vote. Taylor is the board’s current chair. 
Rep. Justin Ruffridge, R-Soldotna and a pharmacist, said Taylor has taken a “somewhat antagonistic” approach toward working with other licensed medical professionals.
The vast majority of nominations received no comment from legislators.
Bergey, renominated to a board that oversees teacher performance, appeared to have few problems getting legislative approval until Sen. Bill Wielechowski, D-Anchorage, noted that she was not nominated for her seat by the state principals association, as required by law.
Bergey had the association’s nomination when she was originally appointed to the professional practices board, but not for her renomination.
“I do not believe this person meets the statutory requirements, and I believe we must reject this nomination,” Wielechowski said.
Legislators rejected her nomination with 33 legislators opposed.
Last year, legislators approved 78 of 81 nominees. In 2023, it was 77 of 78. Three years ago, the governor had a perfect score: The Legislature approved all of his nominees.

Two proposed pulp mills were granted 50-year logging contracts in territorial days: Ketchikan Pulp Company in Ketchikan was awarded 8.25 billion board feet in 1951 and Alaska Pulp Company in Sitka 4.975 billion board feet in 1956. 
Wrangell Lumber Company also received a 50-year contract that allowed them to harvest 60 million board feet of timber annually from the early 1960s until 1990. The sawmill minimally processed the trees into what are known as “cants” and shipped them overseas.
The 1980 Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act exempted the Tongass from complying with the National Forest Management Act of 1976, which led to very low stumpage fees, or the cost timber harvesters had to pay the federal government. The U.S. Forest Service had to spend an enormous amount of staff time surveying timber tracts and building roads in remote areas.
A study by the Southeast Conservation Council calculated the federal government spent $386 million for preparation and sale of Tongass timber while collecting only $32 million in stumpage fees from 1982 to 1988.
While the heyday of the timber industry supported about 4,000 jobs, many were nonresidents or recent arrivals who left when the pulp mills closed. Most of my former colleagues at the Sitka mill went “back home” to Washington when the mill ceased operation. 
The pulp mills closed primarily because of tree farms in warmer climates such as South Africa, where forests grow much faster than the Tongass. Many fruit and vegetable farms in the southern U.S. converted to tree farms.
The 2016 Tongass Land and Resource Management Plan created a 16-year transition period from harvest of old growth trees to second-growth timber. The first 10 years would allow the annual cutting of 34 million board feet of old growth and 12 million board feet of second growth before shifting to 5 million board feet of old growth and 41 million board feet of second-growth trees.
This plan was upset by the 2001 “Roadless Rule,” which set aside 58.5 million acres of national forests, including 9.2 million acres in the Tongass. The national rule forbade “road construction, road reconstruction and timber harvesting” in the set-aside acreage. The first Trump administration ended the Roadless Rule, but the Biden administration reinstated it. Now President Trump again wants to strike it down.
Second-growth forests require massive thinning operations in remote locations and very little thinning has been accomplished in the old clearcuts. The only trees with market value are old growth, which takes a century to reach maturity in the Tongass.
So, are there enough standing old-growth trees to support a vibrant timber industry in the Tongass? It depends upon who you ask.
As a young journalist in Ketchikan, I interviewed a couple of men who took part in the initial surveys of Tongass timber that helped support the 50-year contracts. They said the surveys were accomplished by flyovers with a very few boots on the ground, and grossly overestimated the volume of harvestable timber.
In a recent interview by the Juneau Empire, Joel Jackson, president of the Organized Village of Kake, pointed out that “nobody touched” numerous past timber sales on Kupreanof and Kuiu islands, as the cost of accessing the trees and getting them to market overwhelmed the market value.
If the “DOGE” cuts to the U.S. Forest Service are left in place, the foresters would be hard-pressed to do the groundwork necessary to make sales. 
Those looking to resurrect industrial-scale logging in the Tongass are chasing an old dream that fails to recognize the current importance of tourism, which relies upon healthy forests and wildlife. The salmon fishermen of the Tongass need healthy streams, not clearcuts.

,DC,2025-05-15 01:39:34+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,States on the hook for billions under U.S. House GOP bill making them help pay for SNAP,Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/states-hook-billions-under-us-house-gop-bill-making-them-help-pay-snap,,"The U.S. House Agriculture Committee approved, 29-25, Wednesday evening its portion of Republicans’ major legislative package that includes a provision that would shift to states some of the responsibility to pay for a major nutrition assistance program.The bill would require states, for the first time, to cover part of the cost of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits that provide $100 billion per year to help 42 million Americans afford groceries. The measure would also shift more of the administrative cost to states and increase work requirements for recipients.Republicans are planning to combine the measure with legislation from 10 other committees in a budget reconciliation package that allows the Senate to avoid its usual 60-vote threshold.House Agriculture Chairman Glenn “GT” Thompson said the panel’s bill and its estimated $290 billion deficit savings over a 10-year budget window were necessary for the larger legislative package to extend tax cuts and increase border security and defense spending.The package would “prevent the largest tax increase in American history on our families, farmers and small businesses, and (would) deliver critical funding necessary for the Trump administration to continue their work keeping Americans safe,” the Pennsylvania Republican said in an opening statement.“Our reconciliation instructions provide the opportunity to restore integrity to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, to make sure that this essential program works for the most vulnerable and functions as Congress has intended.”Republicans on the panel said throughout a marathon committee meeting, which started Tuesday night and wrapped up more than 26 hours later following an overnight break, that the added work requirements and accountability measures for state governments were overdue reforms.The panel’s GOP majority approved the bill over unified opposition from Democrats, who argued that the measure would unfairly cut benefits to needy families to pay for tax cuts for high earners, undermine the panel’s bipartisan tradition of fusing crop subsidies with nutrition assistance and overburden state governments that can’t afford to take on the additional cost.Ranking Democrat Angie Craig of Minnesota called the measure “the largest rollback of an anti-hunger program in our nation's history” which would be felt deeply across a broad swath of recipients.“We will see children going to bed without dinner, more seniors skipping meals to afford their medicine, more parents sacrificing their own nutrition, so their kids can eat,” Craig said. “Every single one of us knows (the cuts) will take food away from families at a time when working folks are struggling with higher costs.”State contributionsThe bill would make states pay for up to 25% of SNAP benefits, which are currently entirely covered by the federal government, starting in 2028.States would be required to pay at least 5%, with the rate rising with a state’s payment error rate. The highest state cost-share would be triggered by a state reaching a 10% or higher error rate.Even at the lowest state cost-share, the provision would add $4.7 billion overall to annual state obligations, according to an analysis published Wednesday by the center-left think tank Center for Budget and Policy Priorities.But only seven states would have qualified for the lowest cost-share in fiscal 2023, the most recent year for which data is available. The national error rate was 11.7% and more than two dozen states and territories had error rates higher than 10%.That means in practice the costs to states would be much higher. The three most populous states — California, Texas and Florida — alone would have combined to owe more than $5.7 billion under their 2023 error rates and 2024 benefit amounts.Republican members said the requirement would incentivize states to better manage their programs.“Unlike every other state-administered entitlement program, SNAP benefit is 100% funded by the federal government, resulting in minimal incentives for states to control costs, enhance efficiencies and improve outcomes for recipients,” Thompson said.Impact on state budgetsDemocrats said states could ill afford to take on additional costs, meaning the bill would result in cuts to the program or other critical services.“The massive unfunded mandate this bill forces on states just passes the buck onto state legislatures, forcing them to slash local programs and services, cut benefits, kick vulnerable people off SNAP or raise taxes,” Craig said. “We already know states can't afford it.”The change would force difficult decisions for states, several Democrats said.In Ohio, the state would be on the hook for an additional $534 million annually, Democrat Shontel Brown said.“That's not to expand benefits or improve outcomes, that's just to maintain the status quo.” she said. “To cover the costs, Ohio, along with every other state, is going to have to make brutal tradeoffs. It's going to mean cutting K-12 education funding, scaling back opioid and mental health treatment programs, reducing Medicaid coverage or putting off critical infrastructure repairs.”Republicans countered that the provision would bring much needed accountability to state administrators, which would make the program fairer overall.Alaska had an error rate of nearly 60% in fiscal 2023. Without mentioning that state, Derrick Van Orden, a Republican whose home state of Wisconsin was among the few states with error rates under 6%, said the costs associated with such numerous errors shouldn’t be covered by states with lower rates.“Overpayments, waste, fraud and abuse have plagued programs like SNAP,” he said. “There is a state that has a 59.59% overpayment rate and my Wisconsinites are not going to pick up that slack.”States’ error rates include fraud, but it makes up a small share of a category that also includes inadvertent underpayments and overpayments, Michigan Democrat Kristen McDonald Rivet said.SNAP has a fraud rate of less than 1% and work requirements already exist, McDonald Rivet said. Republicans’ efforts to target fraud and add work requirements wouldn’t reach the cost savings they sought, she said.“Are there error rates in the states? Sure,” she said. “Should we address it? Absolutely. But the idea that we are going to find $300 billion of cuts — $300 billion of cuts — on that small percentage of people who are not working that are already required to or error rates in the states is just a flat-out lie. What we are really doing is cutting food for people.”Administrative costsThe bill would also increase states’ share of the cost of administering the food assistance program.Under current law, states and the federal government evenly split the cost of administering the program. The bill would have states shoulder 75% of administrative costs.Democrats, including the ranking member of the panel’s Nutrition, Foreign Agriculture, and Horticulture Subcommittee, complained that would compound the problems created by the new cost structure for SNAP benefits.“States will be forced to budget more for SNAP benefits with less for administrators,” Rep. Jahana Hayes of Connecticut said. “With fewer administrative staff, it is inevitable that errors will increase.”Work requirementsAnother section of the bill would expand the number of participants subject to work requirements to receive SNAP benefits.The proposal would raise from 54 to 64 the age at which a person no longer has to meet work requirements. It would also lower from 18 to 7 the age at which caring for a child exempts a person from work requirements.Democrats raised and introduced several amendments meant to address the provision, but were outvoted each time.Kansas Republican Tracey Mann said the changes were not only about improving SNAP efficiency, but would make the program’s rules fairer for those it was meant to serve.“It is wrong to jeopardize the benefits of the single mom taking care of kids too young to be in school or the disabled or elderly in order to subsidize someone who is perfectly capable of making an honest income but isn't willing to join the workforce,” Mann said.“These changes will ensure that individuals are served by the program as it was intended — not as a couch that you can sit on as long as you want, but as a true safety net that gets you back on the ladder of opportunity and back into a job.”",,,,2025-05-14 22:01:22.740982

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout) A Tennessee U.S. congressman said Wednesday he will call for an investigation into Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell following more than a week of traffic sweeps and detentions by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency in Nashville. 
U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles, a Republican representing the 5th District which covers part of Nashville, alleged in a press release that O’Connell is responsible for “blatantly obstructing” ICE agents. 
“By ordering city agencies to monitor and potentially sabotage ICE operations, he has crossed a dangerous line — using the power of government to shield criminal illegal aliens from the law,” Ogles said in a statement.
Ogles plans to ask the U.S. House Judiciary Committee and the Homeland Security Committee to investigate O’Connell and other Metro Nashville officials. 
Immigration and Customs Enforcement “dragnet” in Nashville results in detentions

The statement came one day after a U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) official singled out O’Connell in a statement claiming ICE agents — in conjunction with Tennessee Highway Patrol officers — arrested 196 people without permanent legal status. Allegedly, 95 of those had either pending criminal charges or convictions. 
“By ICE’s own admission, a large percentage of people caught up in this sweep had no criminal record. Who and where are they? ICE should release the names and charges for everyone they detained in Nashville, not just a select few,” O’Connell said in a statement. 
A spokesperson for O’Connell declined to specifically address Ogles’ comments.
Since May 4, ICE agents and THP officers have been conducting sweeps through Nashville and Middle Tennessee, often pulling drivers over for alleged traffic violations. 
Metro Legal Director Wally Dietz said on May 5 he sent a letter to the Tennessee Highway Patrol asking for the names of those arrested and what those people were charged with. Officials with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency, he added, have been “totally opaque in responding.”
Tennessee 5th District Congressman confirms FBI fraud investigation

The detention comes amid a federal and state focus on immigrants and moves to deport them. In a January special legislative session, the Tennessee General Assembly passed sweeping immigration legislation to create a new state enforcement office as a liaison with the Trump administration and provide grants to law enforcement agencies that agree to work with federal immigration officials. Under a federal program, local police and sheriff deputies can work with ICE to enforce federal immigration laws and criminalize public officials who vote for sanctuary city policies.
Ogles has had his own brushes with federal law. In August 2024, Ogles confirmed the FBI had confiscated his phone amid a fraud investigation into his campaign finances and as recently as January, a U.S. House Congressional Ethics panel recommended further investigation into his activities. In late January, just after President Donald Trump was inaugurated, the FBI announced it would drop the investigation.
Ogles has proposed a measure that would allow Trump to serve a third term as president.

Merv Riepe of Ralston and Kathleen Kauth of the Millard area meet on the floor of the Nebraska Legislature. April 22, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A bill seeking to define “male” and “female” in Nebraska law advanced Wednesday for K-12 and collegiate sports teams alone, no longer for school bathrooms, school locker rooms or state agencies.
State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston ultimately supported Legislative Bill 89, the “Stand With Women Act,” on the condition that his amendment was adopted to limit the bill to sports. He said the amended bill preserves athletic competition without a “moral panic” against transgender Nebraskans.
“I did not run for office to become part of the ‘Nebraska State Potty Patrol,’” said Riepe, who publicly requested the change last month.
  State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston. April 8, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Riepe’s amendment was adopted 34-8. The bill advanced 33-15.
The “panic,” Riepe said, “is no different” than when some people justified “government overreach” to argue that video games make people violent, rock music leads to devil worship and comic books corrupt youth.
He said “reason eventually won out” and “cooler heads prevailed” in those cases.
Bill requirements and definitions
Under the bill, a student-athlete would need to verify their sex at birth with a doctor’s note before they could participate in single-sex sports, which State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of the Millard area, LB 89’s sponsor, envisioned would come during a student’s physical exam.
Public school sports would be restricted to students’ sex assigned at birth, for males or females only, unless coed/mixed. There would be an exception if there is no female equivalent team, such as football. Private schools competing against public institutions would need to do the same.
“Sex” would be defined as whether someone “naturally has, had, will or would have, but for a congenital anomaly or intentional or unintentional disruption, the reproductive system that at some point produces, transports and utilizes” either eggs (female, woman or girl) or sperm (male, man or boy) for fertilization.
‘Incremental steps’
Kauth, who designated LB 89 as her 2025 priority, said her bill was about “common sense” and “adherence to biology” while establishing protections for women and girls.
She said she was grateful to Riepe, and while she wished the bill could remain in full, she respected Riepe and said, “Sometimes making incremental steps is the best way to go.”

Kauth said she would return in 2026 and try again for bathrooms and locker rooms, which Riepe said he would not support. He said LB 89 indirectly took care of locker rooms and that he was against turning the Legislature into a “vehicle for fear, overreach and culture war crusades.”
“LB 89, as amended, respects that line,” Riepe said during debate. “It focuses on competition, not surveillance. It protects sports, not panic.”
Gov. Jim Pillen, speaking with the Nebraska Examiner a few weeks ago, said he would accept the pared-back LB 89 “if that’s where it ends up.” He said that if a boy goes into a woman’s restroom, “the rest of the boys will take care of him.”
Kauth said LB 89 would prevent that self-policing and that a “high-trust society” would give faith that someone under her bill is on the right sports team, or as in the larger bill, bathroom.
Some opponents, such as State Sens. Megan Hunt and John Cavanaugh, both of Omaha, have said Kauth’s bill would require policing on whether anyone is allowed in the “right” bathroom or locker room and would be discriminatory against transgender Nebraskans.
‘Jesus loved us all’
Still, opponents to LB 89 did not block Riepe’s amendment — State Sens. Jane Raybould of Lincoln and Dan Quick of Grand Island even voted for the amendment, despite not voting to advance the bill later.

Progressives, such as State Sens. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln, Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha, George Dungan of Lincoln and Victor Rountree of Bellevue, instead took time to speak directly to transgender Nebraskans and their families, knowing they couldn’t stop the bill.
Conrad said that in more than a decade in public life, she’d never seen one group of Nebraskans and their families suddenly “under attack by their government.” She said opponents would “lean in with more love and light when faced with darkness.”
“Those of us who stand on the right side of history and in support of human rights will not stop until each member of the human family is afforded equal rights and human rights,” said Conrad, who previously led the ACLU of Nebraska. “I thank you for your love and compassion in the face of hate and harm.”
Rountree said that as a pastor, he would stand with love “because Jesus loved us all.”
‘I don’t hate anyone’
State Sen. Dan Lonowski of Hastings, a former public school teacher, said the bill wasn’t about discrimination and noted that he would often have LGBTQ students eat in his classroom over lunch because they didn’t want to eat in the full cafeteria. He said it didn’t matter his political affiliation and that it was about giving those students space.
State Sen. Mike Jacobson of North Platte said that if someone wants to be transgender, “be transgender,” and if they want to play sports, they can, just on the team corresponding to their sex.
  State Sen. Tanya Storer of Whitman. Feb. 10, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Kauth and State Sen. Tanya Storer of Whitman said it was “shocking” that lawmakers needed to defend women’s rights, and Kauth said LB 89 sought to prevent discrimination against women. The pair called out Dungan, who said lawmakers needed to “shut up” and leave the issue alone.
Storer said it was “gaslighting” to suggest that supporters had “hate” in their hearts, which she denied.
“I see the faces of beautiful women disappearing, being erased, so they’re supposed to step aside, be quiet, sit down, shut up, for fear of being called out for ‘hating,’” Storer said.
She added: “You can defend the rights of women and not hate transgender, and I don’t hate anyone.”
‘Love thy neighbor’
Sen. John Cavanaugh said he didn’t think the problem was “hatred” or “discrimination,” while he thought there might be some “misunderstanding” of what “discrimination” means legally. 
“I think this is an unwillingness to get to know people,” he said.
  State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha. May 19, 2023. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner).
Hunt said children just wanted “the freedom to play with their friends without being politicized.” Dungan said “all they’re asking is to be left alone.”
Cavanaugh pointed to the biblical commandment to “love thy neighbor as thyself,” and that when he met families who would be hurt by LB 89, they were “just regular Nebraska families.” He said that while with Riepe’s amendment the bill is “less harmful,” trans children would still be hurt.
“If people have hurt your feelings by saying that you are ‘hateful’ and ‘discriminatory,’ then I’m sorry,” Cavanaugh said, “but do not take that out on these children.”

Tony Sorrentino of the Elkhorn area remains vacant on Wednesday, May 14, 2025. His absence led to the defeat of a bill seeking to weaken voter-approved minimum wage increasees, LB 258. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska lawmakers expected to spend two hours Wednesday on a nearly inevitable proposal to slow voter-approved annual increases in the state’s minimum wage to a fixed rate, rather than the faster inflation-based bumps passed in 2022.
Lincoln State Sen. Jane Raybould’s proposal faced a promised filibuster. Yet even her opponents knew the measure had the votes to be sent to the governor’s desk. Wednesday was set to be the latest example in a trend of the officially nonpartisan but GOP-dominated Legislature pushing back against a handful of ballot measures passed by Nebraska voters on paid sick leave, minimum wage, school vouchers and medical marijuana.
A moment arrived
But instead of grinding things to a halt, State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln began withdrawing her delay-focused motions to force an unexpectedly quicker vote on the proposal.

Conrad asked for a roll call in reverse order, as one of the 33 lawmakers needed to tweak voter-approved proposals that changed state law was absent. 
Under the Legislature’s rules, the reverse order vote caused the missing lawmaker, State Sen. Tony Sorrentino of the Elkhorn area, to be considered “excused not voting” as his name is lower than on the roll, and votes are typically done in alphabetical order. This caused the bill to fail 31-17.  
Raybould, the lone Democrat supporting a slower minimum wage increase, said she thought Conrad and other Democratic-aligned lawmakers were acting in good faith or “goodwill” as she had the votes for passage. 
Instead, filibustering lawmakers celebrated a short-term political victory defending what they called “the will of the people.” And Raybould and her Republican colleagues were left hunting for a backup plan — a broader bill to which they could attach the contents of her Legislative Bill 258.
Stalled but not stopped?
The move most likely delays but will not stop the passage of Raybould’s proposal. Lawmakers were already discussing amending it onto State Sen. Beau Ballard’s Legislative Bill 415, which is aimed at weakening voter-approved paid sick leave protections. Raybould’s LB 258 had secured 33 votes with a “compromise” from State Sen. Stan Clouse of Kearney.
  State Sen. Jane Raybould of Lincoln. March 31, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Currently, the state minimum wage is $9 an hour. If lawmakers do nothing, voters will increase it to $15 next year. Then it will increase each year based on a cost of living measurement, a calculation of inflation for the Midwest region from the previous August. 
Raybould’s stalled proposal, in its current form, would shrink the voter-approved annual increases by capping the annual increase after next year to 1.75%. It also would create a youth minimum wage and amend a separate state training wage to limit it to workers aged 16 to 19 at 75% of the state minimum wage later this year, rather than at 75% of the federal wage. Training workers can earn that wage for up to the employee’s first 90 days on the job.
Under the voter-approved law, workers would see larger wage increases. But Raybould and supporters of her measure said her changes would protect small businesses that could not afford to pay more. 
Next steps
Raybould told reporters she is not comfortable with suspending legislative rules to bring back her bill. She said she would look into whatever options are available to “get something done this year.” 
She added that Sorrentino’s absence during the vote was “a rookie error on his part.” 
She didn’t specify what options she is considering. Ballard told the Examiner he would be open to adding Raybould’s proposal to his paid sick leave bill. He voted present, not voting during the vote, once he realized the votes weren’t there, so he could possibly file a reconsideration motion. But statehouse rules don’t allow that type of maneuver. He filed a motion anyway, according to the Legislature’s website. That could hint at a possible rules suspension to retake the vote.
“There’s always next year,” Raybould said. 
Or maybe sooner, if an alternative arises.

(Getty Images)LINCOLN — Nerves are fraying among those seeking to expand broadband service across Nebraska due to funding uncertainty caused by recent actions by the Trump Administration and the Legislature.
However, a state official said he isn’t worried that the largest program, the $42.5 billion Broadband Equity, Access and Deployment (BEAD) program, enacted by the Biden Administration to bring high-speed “internet for all,” would be impacted.
Patrick Haggerty, director of the Nebraska Broadband Office, said Wednesday that his office continues to take applications for the first-round of BEAD grants while it awaits “new guidance” on the distribution of those funds.

Despite the cancellation Friday of a $1.25 billion “digital equity” training program by the Trump Administration, Haggerty said he has seen “no indication” that the $405 million in BEAD deployment funds sent to Nebraska is going away.
“Getting universal broadband across Nebraska is not at risk in any way,” he told the Examiner.
On Friday, states were informed that the $1.25 billion Digital Equity Competitive Grant Program was being cancelled after President Trump labeled the program “racist and illegal” and unconstitutional.
“No more woke handouts based on race!” Trump posted on his Truth Social account.
States were told that the program used “impermissible and unconstitutional racial preferences,” according to the news site Broadband Breakfast, which reported that at least one state, Vermont, was weighing whether to legally challenge the cancellation.
In a statement last week, U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., called it “absolutely insane” that Trump had cancelled a program because it included the word “equity.”
She said she had drafted the equity program to “close the digital divide” by helping seniors access the internet and providing laptops for “middle schoolers in rural districts.”
The Trump edict eliminates $6.5 million in grants for Nebraska that were intended for nonprofit groups to train and educate people on how to better utilize high-speed internet services and even how to repair computers.
The program targeted eight “covered populations,” including veterans, the elderly, those living in rural areas and members of racial or ethnic minorities.
But additional worries have been spawned by the Nebraska Legislature’s efforts to close a state budget shortfall.

On Tuesday, the Nebraska Public Service Commission ordered that the $20 million-a-year Nebraska Broadband Bridge Act be “held in abeyance” due to the expectation that the funds, which provide incentives for companies to expand high-speed internet into remote areas, will be diverted by the Legislature to help close the state budget gap.
However, BEAD remains the bigger worry among some involved in broadband deployment, that it might be cut back or eliminated as part of Trump Administration efforts to reduce “fraud, waste and abuse.”
There’s been speculation online and by the Wall Street Journal that the BEAD program could undergo dramatic changes by shifting up to $20 billion of the grant funds to the StarLink satellite internet service tied to the world’s richest man, Elon Musk.
Haggerty, the Nebraska broadband czar, said despite the funding uncertainty, “we’re not going to let that slow us down.” The deadline for the first round of grants is Friday. He declined to speculate on when the first grants would be distributed.
He added that the state’s BEAD funding should be enough to provide broadband to the state’s unserved and underserved areas despite the suspension of the Broadband Bridge program.

(Julie O'Donoghue/Louisiana Illuminator)Louisiana legislators could remove the public’s ability to confidentially or anonymously raise concerns about illegal activity by government employees and elected officials. 
The Louisiana House and Governmental Affairs Committee voted 10-4 Wednesday for House Bill 160 from Rep. Kellee Dickerson, R-Denham Springs, despite a warning from the state ethics board that it would have a “chilling effect” on ethics complaints about public employees and leaders. All four lawmakers who voted against the proposal are Republicans. 

“The Board regularly receives complaints requesting that the complainant’s identity remain confidential due to fears of retaliation,” state Ethics Administrator David Bordelon wrote in a letter to the committee sent Monday on behalf of ethics board members. “This is seen most often when a complaint is received from an individual who has information regarding a potential violation by a supervisor or their local elected official.”
“The board still supports that during the investigation the complainant should remain confidential,” Bordelon said Wednesday during a legislative hearing on the proposal. 

Dickerson’s legislation would require the ethics board to provide the identity of anyone who reported an ethics complaint to the target of the investigation. Currently, the identity of a complainant remains unknown to anyone outside of the ethics board and staff, unless the person chooses to identify themselves.
“If any of you have had to go before the ethics board, it is a very intense process,” Dickerson said Wednesday during the committee hearing. “When you’re brought before the ethics committee, who has quite the reputation … It’s difficult.”

“This is to kind of bring some of those frivolous, if you will, complaints down and to help you face your accuser,” she said. 

Dickerson’s legislation would also eliminate the ability to file an ethics complaint against someone anonymously. From 2020-23, the ethics board received 137 anonymous complaints – where the board and staff doesn’t even know the identity of the complainant – that would no longer be allowed. 
In her bill, Dickerson said she’s tried to protect those who report ethics violations from retaliation. It includes a provision to allow lawsuits to be filed against anyone who threatens or coerces someone into not raising a concern with the ethics board.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 
Yet Bordelon said the proposal would also create an inconsistency when it comes to the confidentiality of potential whistleblowers. Dickerson’s bill only eliminates confidentiality for people complaining about government ethics violations. People who report illegal activity related to political campaign fundraising and spending would still be allowed to keep their identity from the target of the investigation, he said.  

Dickerson’s bill is also part of a broader effort since Gov. Jeff Landry came into office to weaken the authority of the ethics board and water down anti-corruption laws. 

Two other major bills are moving through the Legislature this session that would make it harder to investigate government ethics and political campaign wrongdoing. Last year, Landry and lawmakers passed legislation to allow the governor to have more influence over ethics board appointees. 

The ethics board oversees the enforcement of laws related to government corruption, nepotism, lobbying and political campaign finances. It supervises the activities of state and local government, including public employees and elected officials at all levels. 
Landry has had several personal disputes with the ethics board dating back to when he became attorney general in 2016. Most recently, he has been in negotiations over ethics charges the board filed against him in 2023 for not disclosing a trip he took to Hawaii on a political donor’s private plane. 
On top of eliminating confidential and anonymous complaints, Dickerson’s bill would also create other challenges for launching an ethics investigation. 

It limits the materials ethics board members can use to instigate a probe. They would only be able to look into misconduct if an individual filed a formal complaint with the board.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX 

Currently, the board uses a much wider swath of information to launch its investigations. They can initiate inquiries based on state legislative audits, news coverage and required annual reports from the heads of state agencies on potential ethics violations in their departments. 
All of those avenues for pursuing an ethics investigation would be cut off if Dickerson’s bill becomes law. 
Almost half of the board’s 177 investigations from 2020-23 that resulted in a discovery of wrongdoing came from either a legislative audit (21),  one of the annual state agency head reports (44) or a news story (18), according to information provided by the ethics board. None of these investigations would have been launched if Dickerson’s legislation had been in place. 

Also, a large number of the ethics complaints would also have to be filed in person at the ethics board’s office in downtown Baton Rouge under Dickerson’s bill. All “non-sworn” complaints from an individual would have to be delivered by hand, and the person would have to present their government-issued identification when dropping it off. 
“Sworn” complaints – those made under a legal oath attesting to the truthfulness of its statements – could be delivered by mail, fax or electronic means, under Dickerson’s legislation. 

The in-person delivery standard for “non-sworn” complaints would apply to people making complaints about local government officials in all corners of the state. For example, a person who was complaining about potential problems with a local official in Bastrop, in the far northeastern part of the state would have to drive to Baton Rouge to submit their concerns. 

From 2020-23, the board received more than four times as many “non-sworn” complaints as sworn ones from the public, according to information the ethics staff provided. 

Non-sworn complaints also resulted in the largest number of “findings” of an ethics violation. Out of the 177 cases where the board concluded there was wrongdoing, 52 came from non-sworn complaints during the four-year period.

Calvin Schrage, I-Anchorage, during a vote on amendments to the state's capital budget on Monday, May 12, 2025. (Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)The Alaska House of Representatives, following in the path of the state Senate, has approved a small construction and renovation budget for the fiscal year that starts July 1.
The vote on Senate Bill 57, the annual infrastructure bill — formally known as the capital budget — was 21-19, along caucus lines.
When oil prices and production are high, the Alaska Legislature pours hundreds of millions of dollars into new construction and maintenance projects. This spring, with the Legislature anticipating low oil prices and reduced federal funding, the House version of the capital budget proposes to spend just $167.9 million in general-purpose dollars. 
In comparison, the capital budget two years ago spent more than three-quarters of a billion dollars. The newly approved capital budget isn’t the smallest in recent history — in 2016, legislators approved just $107 million — but spending is very limited by historical standards, noted Rep. Calvin Schrage, I-Anchorage, who oversaw the budget on the House Finance Committee.
“This was not a fun or easy year to be the capital budget co-chair,” Schrage said, “due to our state’s dire fiscal picture. We had to say no — or at least not now — to a lot of good projects that would have benefited Alaskans. That said, we were still able to make some meaningful investments.”
A significant amount of the capital budget is being set aside for matching funds needed to unlock federal grants. For example, it allocates $57.2 million in general-purpose money to the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities, which gives the state access to over $2 billion in transportation funding once federal money is considered.
It isn’t yet clear how federal budget cuts will affect that figure. The budget is set based on what is known as of today.
With general-purpose revenue limited, the House and Senate finance committees were mostly limited to assigning money to deferred maintenance projects at state facilities spread across Alaska.
For example, the Senate added $19 million to the major maintenance list at public schools. The House added another $19 million on top of that, enough to cover the top nine projects on the list..
“We basically had an agreement going in; we got half, they got half,” said Sen. Bert Stedman, R-Sitka and Senate Finance Committee co-chair.
When it came to discretionary funding, requests from individual legislators for things like playgrounds or streetlights, the House and Senate were again treated equally.
“Everybody got nothing,” Stedman said.
Budget documents show few exceptions to Stedman’s comment. 
One of the few budget additions made by the House was $500,000 for a Blood Bank of Alaska testing lab. Gov. Mike Dunleavy requested the money, the Senate rejected it, but the House added it back in.
In many places, the budget attempted to use other sources of money instead of general-purpose dollars that primarily come from Permanent Fund earnings, oil taxes and royalties.
For example, Dunleavy requested $7 million for a time and attendance system to be used by state employees. The Senate cut that request to $4 million, and instead of using general-purpose dollars, lawmakers took additional money from the accounts of the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority. The House approved that change.
Of the budget overall, Schrage said lawmakers tried to deny projects equally, without regard to party or district.
“I know that this won’t make everyone happy, but we’ve done the best that we can,” he said.
The budget will return to the Senate for a concurrence vote, then advance to Dunleavy, who has line-item veto power and may eliminate individual budget items but cannot add new ones.

(Mary Ann Chastain / Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — When state Supreme Court Justice John Few bought fishing flies off Amazon on Tuesday, he felt like he was purchasing from the online retail giant.
But Few was actually buying from a third-party seller on the website.
Whether Amazon should have collected sales taxes on purchases like that prior to 2019 — when a state law made clear it was mandatory — is at the heart of a nearly decade-long case argued before the high court Wednesday.
Attorneys for Amazon claim it’s a marketplace, not a seller. But attorneys for the state contend that Amazon is selling the products, regardless of whether it is literally the one listing the items.
If justices agree with the state, Amazon could have to pay more than $277 million in back taxes and interest for sales on the website between April 1, 2016, and 2019, according to the Department of Revenue.
That amount is tied to two separate pending cases. Amazon already paid the $12 million at the center of the case heard Wednesday.
Ruling by SC high court could result in Amazon owing $277M in back taxes

In 2019, Amazon began collecting sales taxes from third-party sellers and sending them to the state after the Legislature passed a law requiring “marketplace facilitators,” or platforms that facilitated sales by others, to pay sales tax on all purchases made.
Amazon should’ve been doing that all along, and the change simply clarified existing law, argued Chad Johnston, an attorney for the state.
But attorneys for Amazon countered that under the prior law, which they claim was ambiguous, Amazon didn’t count as a “seller,” so it didn’t have to collect sales taxes on items posted by third parties.
Under an agreement with Amazon, third-party sellers are responsible for collecting and paying their own sales taxes. For an additional $40 monthly fee, Amazon will collect sales taxes for third-party sellers, but the company still sends the money back to the seller to forward to the state Department of Revenue.
Amazon is certainly selling products, Few said.
If someone asked where he bought his new equipment, Few asked Amazon’s attorney, how should he respond?
“Well, your perspective might be you bought it on the Amazon marketplace, but if you actually look into your receipt, you will find out who you bought it from,” replied attorney Rob Hochman.
Amazon is a “pure marketplace,” Hochman said, where shops of all kinds can sell their products.
Like Few, people may feel like they’re buying from Amazon directly, but in many cases, they are not, he said.
Because it’s impossible to know how people think and feel about a topic, interpreting the law from the way customers view their purchases would be “a wreckage of the law,” Hochman said.
“I totally understand why it might be intuitive to say, ‘Let’s just look at this from the consumer’s perspective,’” Hochman said. “Well, tax law can’t work that way.”
That’s not necessarily the case, Johnston argued.
Amazon does more than simply provide a platform for people to post their products. Customers can visit Amazon’s website and search for products, compare prices, make purchases, receive items and receive refunds all while interacting only with Amazon, he said.
Whether the law applies to Amazon could come down to the exact phrasing, Few said.
By legal definition, the state sales tax applies to anyone “engaged … in the business of selling.”
“No doubt, Amazon Services is a business, but are we in the business of selling?” Hochman said.
According to the ruling by the state Court of Appeals, the answer is yes, Amazon is “in the business of selling.” But the lower court’s decision didn’t draw a line as to what else might count.
Few presented scenarios: If a credit card is used to make a purchase, does that make the credit card company “in the business of selling?” What about a bank holding the funds, or a delivery service bringing a person their order?
“There are people who are, in my view, engaged in this business,” Few said. “Where does it end?”
The decision should come down to Amazon’s total control over everything on its website, Johnston said.
Credit card companies “are not offering advertising services for the products,” Johnston said. “They’re not controlling the format and descriptions on the listing page. They’re not suggesting for review the purchase through a proprietary algorithm that accounts for 50% of the sales on the website.”
In the first ruling in the case, the Administrative Law Court compared Amazon to a consignment shop.
As Hochman began to make his case Wednesday, Chief Justice John Kittredge asked, “Are you a mall or a credit card company?”
“We’re more like a mall than a credit card company,” Hochman replied.
A sales tax exemption the Legislature approved for Amazon in May 2011 — in order to secure the company’s plans to build distribution centers in South Carolina — applied only to items purchased directly through Amazon, Hochman said.
And after that exemption expired Dec. 31, 2015, the company began collecting sales taxes from all purchases made by South Carolinians that weren’t sold by third parties.
Amazon has disputed two other tax bills, which comprise the approximately $277 million the Department of Revenue says the company owes. The cases are on hold pending a decision from the state Supreme Court.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/SCSupremeCourt-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-14 21:01:42.967653

Fate of the Wyoming Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit’s  science faculty — Matt Kauffman, Anna Chalfoun and Annika Walters — unclear as president orders deep cuts.
The post Trump’s ‘liquidation plans’ could wipe out Wyoming research group renowned for migration work appeared first on WyoFile .","The future of a Wyoming-focused science team that helped understand and popularize the phenomenon of wildlife migration is uncertain after a series of moves by the Trump administration’s U.S. Geological Survey to hollow out or even end its 43 cooperative research units. 
Multiple sources reached by WyoFile this week said that plans are being developed to vastly reduce or even eliminate the entire national program, started in Iowa 90 years ago by conservationist J.N. “Ding” Darling. The Wyoming Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit has been around since 1977.
“They have been instructed to develop liquidation plans,” said Tony Wasley, president and CEO of the Wildlife Management Institute. “I don’t know if it’s in anticipation of partial elimination or if it’s bigger than that, but they have been working to that end.” 

(U.S. Geological Survey)
Wasley’s organization is the private partner in the 43 cooperative research units. The U.S. Geological Survey pays the professors’ salaries while other cooperators in the research units are the Wildlife Management Institute, state wildlife management agencies, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and universities. In addition to USGS, Fish and Wildlife Service and the Wildlife Management Institute, the Wyoming unit’s unique partners are the Wyoming Game and Fish Department and the University of Wyoming. 
The Wyoming Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit has been best known publicly in recent years for its work on wildlife migration. Under its lead scientists and USGS employee Matt Kauffman, it administers the Wyoming Migration Initiative, which has refined the science, informed policy on the state and federal level and through its storytelling popularized the biological phenomenon of migration.

John Organ, a former chief of the USGS’ Cooperative Research Unit program, received the same information that Wasley did. 
“Co-Op Unit leadership was told to come up with a plan to dispose of all vehicles and equipment and shut things down within two weeks,” Organ told WyoFile.
A story by Government Executive, an online magazine covering government affairs, increased alarm that Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency saw no need to continue with the cooperatives, which housed nearly 1,200 scientists, staff and students nationally in 2024. The publication reported that the USGS was laying off around 1,000 employees — and focusing the cuts on the Ecosystems Mission Area, which has roughly the same number of employees. The cooperative research units fall under USGS’ Ecosystems Mission Area. 
Subsequently, the cooperatives got a slight reprieve: the U.S. Court for the Northern District of California issued a temporary restraining order pausing most federal agencies’ reduction-in-force notices through May 23, Government Executive reported. There was an additional glimmer of hope the research units might be spared when word spread this week that the 1,000 jobs cut would be distributed throughout the entire USGS, which has around 8,000 employees, according to the agency’s budget brief. 
Organ, however, heard that the layoffs would “disproportionately” hit the USGS’ Ecosystems Mission Area and its cooperative research units. If any units survive the reduction-in-force layoffs, there are longer-term challenges. Trump’s 2026 budget request proposes $564 million in cuts to the agency, shaving roughly a third of its current appropriation, and an internal email publicized by Science suggests the administration has plans to fully eliminate the $307 million Ecosystems Mission Area. 
Federal appropriations to the cooperative research units have ranged from $17.3 million to $28.2 million over the past decade, according to a USGS fact sheet.
Agencies mostly mum
The U.S. Geological Survey’s public affairs officers at the agency’s Washington, D.C. headquarters did not respond to an interview request for this story. 
Ahead of the budget cuts, non-federal members of the Wyoming cooperative aren’t saying much about its potential demise. 
The Wyoming Game and Fish Department declined an interview for this story. 
At the University of Wyoming, the unit falls under the College of Agriculture, Life Sciences and Natural Resources. Kelly Crane, the dean, was unavailable for an interview, but told WyoFile in an email that he has little information about the situation.

“The expectation that our [cooperative research unit] faculty will be terminated by USGS has not been confirmed or even conveyed to UW,” Crane wrote. “We are aware of a potential [reduction-in-force] at USGS aimed at the Ecosystem Services section, but that is the extent of my insight.” 
It’s unclear, Wasley said, if Wyoming’s and the other 42 research units could continue as a private, public partnership in the absence of federal funding. Those are conversations, he said, taking place right now. 
“We understand that time is our biggest enemy,” Wasley said. “We’re doing everything we can to figure out how to maintain what we view as critical capacity for conservation, particularly for the fish and wildlife community.” 
Kauffman was not authorized by USGS to give an interview, but losing him “would throw us into disarray,” said Greg Nickerson, the Wyoming Migration Initiative’s only other full-time employee. 
“There is a tremendous amount of work that would not be happening without Matt,” he told WyoFile.

With the USGS’ Corridors Mapping Team, Kauffman has spearheaded publishing five volumes of ungulate migration maps and has a sixth in the works, Nickerson said. The federally funded University of Wyoming professor has also been integral to the Global Initiative on Ungulate Migration, which launched an interactive global atlas last year. 
There’s a theme to Kauffman’s work, Nickerson said. He uses science not only to understand large mammal migration, but also to guide its conservation by providing actionable information.
“That model has really developed here in Wyoming,” Nickerson said.
Lot to lose
Bob Lanka, a former Wyoming Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit graduate who went on to supervise statewide wildlife and habitat management for Game and Fish, described the potential hit to migration research as “only part of the story.” The unit’s other USGS-salaried staffers, Anna Chalfoun and Annika Walters, have conducted important research that informs management tools like the Wyoming State Wildlife Action Plan.
Wyoming Game and Fish, he said, has improved its capacity to do its own research, but still leans on the cooperative for the “more difficult” research questions. 
“Like, how do songbirds react to oil and gas development? And not only how do they react, but why do they react that way?” Lanka said. 
Anna Chalfoun looks for songbird nests in the sagebrush. Chalfoun has been studying sagebrush songbirds since 2008. (Dave Showalter).
Between current and former students, the Kauffman, Chalfoun and Walters labs have mentored nearly five dozen graduate students, according to the cooperative’s website. Browsing the names, it’s clear many have remained within Wyoming, employed with the Game and Fish or through other nongovernmental organizations. 
Nationally, there are “hundreds” of graduate students whose research is now in limbo, said Steve Williams, a former U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service director who earned his Ph.D. via the Pennsylvania Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit in the early 1980s. 
“I have friends in the Fish and Wildlife Service, and know folks in the co-op units, and they don’t know what tomorrow is going to bring,” Williams told WyoFile. “This is a hell of a way to run a government if you’re looking for efficiency. It makes no sense at all.” 

(U.S. Geological Survey)
Outside of the Trump administration’s target on the program, Williams has never heard of any displeasure with the 43 cooperative research units, either from the states or universities. 
“It’s just the opposite,” he said. “We just added a couple co-op units recently.”
Wyoming’s unit, Williams said, is the “poster child of what the research cooperatives can do for fish and wildlife.” They took on a “real problem,” he said, and helped solve the puzzle of how migration works — and what it requires to survive — on the modern landscape. 
“Matt Kaufman and all the students and researchers, they pushed that issue right to the Secretary of Interior,” the former Fish and Wildlife Service director said. “They’re making great strides protecting migration corridors. What’s going to happen if they go away?”

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – Gov. Kevin Stitt and legislative leaders on Wednesday announced an agreement on a $12.6 billion state budget for the upcoming fiscal year that contains a tax cut, increased education spending and money to purchase a prison.
Republican leaders praised the budget deal, with one legislator calling it the smoothest negotiations he’d seen in seven years. 
Democrats, though, expressed doubts that the deal benefits Oklahoma residents. 
The proposed tax cut, which drops the state’s top income bracket to 4.5% from 4.75%, comes after years of calls from Stitt. The Republican had faced roadblocks from lawmakers within his own party, who feared it could harm state coffers in bad revenue years. 
It also reduces the number of tax brackets from six to three.
“It stays in people’s pockets to be able to be spent how they see fit,” Stitt said.
The plan calls for triggers to further reduce the top bracket when revenue hits a certain target. Most Oklahomans fall within the top bracket.
A family of four with an income of $50,000 would save about $137 a year, according to Senate staff.
“That’s going to be very, very significant for a lot of families,” Stitt said.
He said the cut is needed so Oklahoma can be competitive with other states.
The budget agreement keeps most state agency allocations flat. However, it includes a 3.15% increase in public school funding, but a nearly 8.8% decrease in CareerTech funding, according to the Oklahoma State School Boards Association. Public schools will get $3.98 billion, up from $3.86 billion, according to the association.
Some other agencies are slated to receive strategic investments for special projects.
Some $200 million will go to construct a University of Oklahoma pediatric heart hospital, said House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow.
Another $250 million is allocated to the Oklahoma State University College of Veterinary Medicine in an effort to increase the number of animal doctors in the state, Hilbert said.
“It has not been taken care of and it should be an absolute gem for the state of Oklahoma,” Hilbert said.
The state also plans to buy the private prison in Lawton for $312 million. The facility currently houses about 2,300 Oklahoma inmates.   
The budget keeps about $3.5 billion in state savings, Hilbert said.
Senate Appropriations Chairman Chuck Hall, R-Perry, said the budget allocates funding to address deferred maintenance at state facilities.
It also calls for a $26 million supplemental appropriation for the financially troubled Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services. 
In addition, it gives the agency some funds to finance the provisions of a settlement agreement that the state entered into after being sued for not providing competency restoration services to inmates awaiting trial, said Trey Caldwell, R-Faxon, the House Appropriations and Budget Committee chairman.
On the policy side, Republicans said they agreed to create business courts, which are specialized courts that handle commercial litigation matters. They also said they’ve agreed to reform the state’s workers’ compensation system and lawsuits.
Under the proposed tort reform, lawmakers are expected to propose a cap on damages for pain and suffering, called non-economic damages. A prior cap was deemed unconstitutional.
The bills are being drafted and will run through the legislative process, officials said.
Hilbert said it was the seventh year he has been involved in the budget process.
“I would say it to me it feels like the smoothest year in terms of budget negotiations amongst the three stools of the House and Senate and governor,” Hilbert said.
Senate Minority Leader Julia Kirt, D-Oklahoma City, said her party was left out of the process and has some deep concerns about the budget.
She said the budget has priorities for big business and corporate giveaways, but doesn’t prioritize people and services.
“We don’t believe this budget prioritizes people,” she said.
Lawmakers must pass a budget before 5 p.m. May 30.

Bob Ferguson sign or veto a pile of tax bills and a state budget dependent on them? It’s anyone’s guess.
Lawmakers, lobbyists and business leaders are all watching to see what the governor does. Ferguson, just four months on the job, is aware of the acute interest and seems determined to keep folks in suspense right up until Tuesday. 
That’s the appointed deadline for him to act — or not act — on a new two-year operating budget and the pieces of a $9.4 billion tax package on which it is balanced, as well as a multibillion-dollar transportation revenue bill containing a 6-cent increase in the state’s gas tax.
“You’ll hear on Tuesday,” Ferguson said as he walked through a parking lot at Saint Martin’s University in Lacey.  “It’s a work in progress. Each day, we make some decisions and delay others. Some are a little more complicated, so we’ll keep talking.”
Pressed on whether lawmakers should be planning to return in summer to deal with his decisions, Ferguson smiled. “I can’t give anything away. I want to keep people guessing,” he said.

The Standard caught up with the first-term Democrat after he addressed 250 people at the Thurston County Chamber of Commerce’s annual meeting.
Ferguson didn’t provide them any clues either, saying only that he’s busy going through “the many bills that need to be signed or vetoed” and has until Tuesday “to essentially sign the budget or make any vetoes I think are appropriate.”
Ferguson didn’t delve into specific budget decisions except to laud the Legislature for putting his requested $100 million law enforcement hiring grant program in the spending plan. But he did tell the crowd he was surprised it “took so much work” to get it through.
It’s not to the finish line. Those dollars are in House Bill 2015, which he’s yet to sign.
He warned, as he has before, spending cuts are made throughout the budget and some taxes are needed to help overcome a shortfall he pegged at $16 billion over four years.
“There are going to be increased taxes,” he said. “There was no way to cut your way out of a $16 billion shortfall. So there’s going to have to be a balance there.”
With tax hikes on the horizon, he acknowledged, “It is becoming unaffordable for a lot of Washingtonians.”
“Anything that the government does that makes life less affordable is a concern,” he said. “Philosophically speaking, these are your dollars and my job is to spend them as efficiently as possible.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_0785-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-14 20:04:42.767525

Gabe Evans of Fort Lupton participates in an 8th District Republican primary debate at the Grizzly Rose in Denver on June 1, 2024. (Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)Democrats, nonprofit advocates and health providers from across Colorado on Wednesday slammed U.S. Rep. Gabe Evans’ vote in favor of a Republican plan to reduce Medicaid spending by an estimated $625 billion over the next 10 years.
The House Committee on Energy and Commerce advanced the plan — part of a sweeping GOP budget package that envisions trillions of dollars in tax cuts paired with trillions more in cuts to spending programs — after a marathon 26-hour hearing that began Tuesday afternoon in Washington. Evans, a Fort Lupton Republican elected to Congress last year, was one of 30 GOP committee members to vote in favor of the cuts, with all 24 Democrats opposed.
About 1 in 4 of Evans’ constituents in the 8th Congressional District, which includes the northern Denver metro area and parts of Weld County, receive Medicaid benefits. Advocates with Protect Our Care Colorado, a coalition of groups opposed to Medicaid cuts, said that Evans’ yes vote broke a promise he made last month not to “support cuts that harm Colorado providers or patients.”

“The shameful cuts advanced in the Energy and Commerce Committee today … will force Colorado to make impossible choices,” said Kathy White, executive director of the Colorado Fiscal Institute. “These cuts to Medicaid have nothing to do with fiscal responsibility or improving efficiency. They take critical healthcare away from people, plain and simple, to finance tax cuts for the rich.”
U.S. House panel passes GOP plan that cuts Medicaid by $625B, adds work requirement

Colorado lawmakers adjourned their 2025 legislative session last week, but have openly discussed the likelihood that they will have to return for a special session later this year to manage the impact of up to $1 billion in federal cuts to the state-administered Medicaid program.
House Republicans’ plan, part of a so-called budget reconciliation bill, includes new work requirements for Medicaid enrollees, a suspension of Biden-era rules aimed at streamlining enrollment and renewal, reductions to federal matching and cost-sharing rates, and more. An analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, shared with States Newsroom by Republican staff on the Energy and Commerce Committee, estimates that the Medicaid changes would add up to $625 billion in cuts over the next decade.
At nearly 10% of projected spending over that period, it would be the largest cut in the program’s 50-year history. About 10.3 million people would lose access to Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with 7.6 million people becoming uninsured during the 10-year budget window, according to the CBO analysis, which has yet to be released publicly.
In a written statement, Evans dismissed concerns about the cuts as “fear mongering for political purposes,” and said the GOP reconciliation bill will preserve Medicaid “for the people who need it most.”
“This bill follows through on our promises to cut waste, fraud and abuse while simultaneously protecting coverage for Colorado’s most vulnerable populations,” he said.

‘Monstrosity of a bill’
Evans didn’t speak at any point during the Energy and Commerce Committee’s lengthy hearing on the bill, which dragged on as Democrats introduced a series of unsuccessful amendments and procedural motions. He skipped at least one vote, on an amendment brought by Democrats to repeal a provision in the bill prohibiting Planned Parenthood from receiving any federal funds, even to cover the costs of cancer screenings, birth control and other non-abortion-related services.
As the clock neared 1 a.m. in Washington, Democrats moved for a recess until the morning, but Republicans defeated the motion on a party-line vote.










House Republicans are so focused on appeasing Trump and giving tax cuts to billionaires that they are gutting essential health care programs and providers.


– U.S. Rep. Diana DeGette


Denver U.S. Rep. Diana DeGette, the No. 2 Democrat on the committee, said in a statement on Wednesday’s vote that Republicans had plowed ahead with the hearing “to hide what they are doing from the American people.”
“House Republicans are so focused on appeasing Trump and giving tax cuts to billionaires that they are gutting essential health care programs and providers,” DeGette said. “I called out their cuts throughout the markup, and I am going to continue to fight to protect Medicaid and access to health care as Republicans try to jam this monstrosity of a bill through Congress.”
Democrats say a nationwide Medicaid work requirement, coupled with new mandates for eligibility verification and other obstacles to enrollment enacted by the bill, are extraneous hurdles that will deny care to millions of eligible Americans. Nearly two-thirds of Medicaid recipients are already employed, and nearly all the rest are caregivers, students and people with disabilities, according to the nonprofit KFF. Studies have found that state-level Medicaid work requirements, like one enacted in Arkansas, result in substantial losses of coverage and higher administrative costs, but no change in the rate of employment.
In addition to the projected rise in the number of uninsured Americans from Medicaid cuts, Democrats pointed to a CBO analysis showing that an additional 5 million people will lose coverage if Republicans, as expected, decline to extend insurance subsidies under the Affordable Care Act before they expire this year, bringing the total number losing insurance to 13.7 million.
U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat who visited Evans’ district in March to denounce the GOP’s Medicaid cuts, took time during the hearing on Tuesday to warn that Platte Valley Medical Center in Brighton was among the health providers that would be at risk of closure under the GOP plan. And she rejected claims by Evans and other Republicans that the cuts would target benefits for immigrants in the country unlawfully or otherwise fall into the categories of “waste, fraud and abuse.”
“The math is not adding up,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “Their claim, which I dispute — but if you believe them, their claim is that 1 million undocumented people are on Medicaid. So why are they trying to cut 13.7 million Americans off their health care?”
“Who do you believe?” asked Ocasio-Cortez. “The people who are trying to cut this — not, by the way, to cut from ‘undeserving people’ to give to ‘deserving people’ — but they are cutting these Medicaid dollars to pay for tax cuts for Elon Musk and billionaires.”

(Photo courtesy of Boeing)A $96 billion deal with Qatar Airways will give Boeing its largest order ever for South Carolina-made planes, the White House announced Wednesday.
The order of up to 210 jumbo jets is part of $244 billion worth of economic deals between the U.S. and Qatar agreed to while President Donald Trump is visiting the country, according to a White House fact sheet.
The Boeing agreement is for 130 of the 787 Dreamliners made in Charleston County, South Carolina and 30 of the 777 planes built in Washington state, with an option for an additional 50 planes of some combination of the two, according to a Boeing news release.
The order breaks three records for Boeing, the company said: It is the largest ever for its “widebody jets,” generally meaning jets with two aisles that can carry lots of passengers on long flights. It is the largest for the 787 Dreamliners made in North Charleston. And it is Qatar Airways’ largest-ever order.
“A major victory for Boeing, North Charleston, and all of South Carolina,” Gov. Henry McMaster wrote on X. “Thank you to President Trump for making this investment possible and for continuing to put American manufacturing first.”
Boeing employs about 8,200 people in South Carolina, most of them in Charleston County.
“We are deeply honored that Qatar Airways has placed this record-breaking order with Boeing, one that solidifies their future fleet with our market-leading widebody airplane family at its center,” Stephanie Pope, president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said in the company’s release.
The purchase will make Qatar Airways the largest operator of 787 Dreamliners in the Middle East.
The airline already operates more than 150 Boeing airplanes, including 777 and 787 passenger jets and 777 Freighters, according to Boeing.
Since 2014, Qatar Airways has ordered 94 777X planes and 30 Dreamliners, according to data from Boeing.
The aircraft will be powered by American-made engines from GE Aerospace.
Producing and delivering the planes will support 154,000 domestic jobs annually and more than a million positions over the course of production, according to the White House.
The company’s CEO, Kelley Ortberg, joined Trump and other officials in Doha, the capital of Qatar, for the announcement.
“The landmark deals celebrated today will drive innovation and prosperity for generations, bolster American manufacturing and technological leadership, and put America on the path to a new Golden Age,” the White House said.
U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham emphasized that this was Boeing’s largest ever widebody and 787 order, dubbing the deal a “game changer” for the company and South Carolina.
“Qatar Airways’ purchase will ensure the Charleston plant has work for many years to come and it is a validation of the work product coming from the Charleston Boeing facility,” Graham said in a statement. “The Boeing workforce in South Carolina has a lot to be proud of – they consistently work hard and provide great airplanes.”
The first of Boeing’s 787 Dreamliners built in South Carolina rolled off the North Charleston assembly line in April 2012, about 2 ½ years after the company chose the site, lured by hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of incentives approved by state lawmakers and county officials.
In exchange, the company promised in fall 2009 to invest at least $750 million and create more than 3,800 full-time jobs.
Boeing has expanded its South Carolina operations multiple times since. In 2013, the Legislature provided $120 million more in incentives after the company pledged to invest an additional $1 billion and add 2,000 jobs.
In December, Boeing pledged to invest another $1 billion and add 500 new jobs over five years.

That action was immediately followed by another use of the rule, this time to get a bill passed repealing the paid sick leave law that was also approved by voters.
The use of the rule — a procedural maneuver known as “calling the previous question,” or PQ — requires a signed motion from 10 members and forces an immediate vote on the bill under debate.
Sen. Adam Schnelting, a Republican from St. Charles, made the motion for a PQ on the abortion amendment shortly after 5 p.m. By 5:30 p.m., that bill, which must be approved by voters on a statewide ballot, had passed.
The sick leave repeal followed, and by 6 p.m. both bills were finished.
In the hour leading up to the vote, Democrats warned that Republicans were destroying months of good will and could expect no more cooperation this year and well into the future.
“Nothing will happen, nothing,” said Senate Minority Leader Doug Beck. “The banner year that everybody had in this place? That is over with.”
Wednesday’s use of the previous question rule is the first time since 2020 when it was invoked and the first time since 2017 when it was used during a regular session. Used regularly in the Missouri House, it is used rarely in the Senate because the chamber has a tradition of unlimited debate and negotiations over difficult issues.
“What we’re doing today is a failure of the Senate,” said state Sen. Stephen Webber, a Democrat from Columbia. “And when there’s a failure in the Senate, there needs to be a response, and that response can’t last forever, but that response has to happen, and it has to be painful, and has to make us all understand that when the Senate doesn’t function as a body, we all lose.”
Just as Republicans were moving to put an abortion ban on the ballot, protests erupted in the Senate gallery, with abortion-rights activists shouting down lawmakers. The gallery was briefly cleared, including the press, and the Senate continued with its work until it adjourned for the year a few hours later.
State Sen. Nick Schroer, a Defiance Republican, said using the PQ is always a last resort. But it was his understanding that “goal posts were being moved” in negotiations by Democrats. 
“I don’t know what transpired, but I do know that we hit a log jam,” he said, leaving the PQ as the only way forward to pass the sick leave repeal and abortion ban. 
 Abortion ban

 Senate Minority Leader Doug Beck speaks about negotiations on a bill that seeks to establish a constitutional amendment to ban abortion (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
The proposed ban seeks to repeal the constitutional right to an abortion but allow exceptions for medical emergencies, fatal fetal anomalies and for survivors of rape and incest in the first 12 weeks of gestation. 
Missourians could see the question on the November 2026 ballot, or as soon as this year if the governor chose to call a special election on the issue. 
The proposed ban, if approved by a simple majority of voters, would reinstate several targeted regulations on abortion providers, or TRAP laws, that were recently struck down as unconstitutional by a Missouri judge. 
It would also ban gender transition surgeries and prescribing medications for gender transition, including puberty blockers, for children younger than 18.
The amendment also includes a severability clause. This could allow the rape and incest exceptions in the amendment to be challenged in federal court as being discriminatory and in violation of the 14th Amendment. 
If approved, the amendment would also require any legal challenges to the state law around reproductive health care be heard in Cole County. The Missouri Attorney General’s Office was recently unsuccessful in convincing the courts to move an ongoing legal battle between the state and Planned Parenthood from Jackson County to Cole County.
The language that could appear on each ballot does not mention the amendment would ban abortions, a detail that’s been highly-criticized by Democrats as deceiving. 
Democrats have also accused Republicans of including the ban on gender-affirming care for minors, which is already illegal in Missouri, as a form of “ballot candy” — a ruse aimed at tricking voters to support a measure they might otherwise vote against.  
Schroer said removal of the transgender health care provisions was a deal breaker for conservative senators. 
“We talked to a lot of our members,” he said, “and they said that issue needs to be included.” 
Amendment 3 narrowly passed in November following a multi-million dollar campaign by abortion-rights advocates. A day later, Planned Parenthood and the ACLU of Missouri sued the state, challenging several of Missouri’s laws focused on abortion facilities and providers.
An amendment to alter the language so it directly states that it is repealing Amendment 3 was defeated just before the motion to cut off debate.
While many sitting Republicans have previously opposed abortion exceptions outside of those to save the mother’s life, many said the November election showed Missourians’ desire for a less stringent law.
Missourians overwhelmingly support abortion exceptions for survivors, an August 2022 SLU/YouGov poll found. The polling was done several weeks after Missouri became the first state to enact a full abortion ban following the overturning of Roe v. Wade.
Since Amendment 3 took effect, surgical abortions are being performed but medication abortions have not.
Three of the state’s several Planned Parenthood clinics have restarted surgical abortions for those up to 12 weeks gestation at clinics in Kansas City, Columbia and St. Louis. 
The clinics were authorized to begin the procedure again for the first time in nearly three years after a judge struck down many of the state’s abortion regulations, citing them as discriminatory.
Medication abortion — the most common means of ending a pregnancy — remains inaccessible in Missouri after the state health department rejected complication plans submitted by the clinics outlining continued care for patients in the case they had any adverse effects from the medication. 
 Sick leave law

  State Sen. Tracy McCreery, D-Olivette, prepares for Senate Republicans to force a vote on a constitutional amendment to ban abortion (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
If the bill is signed by the governor, the paid-sick leave benefits approved by voters that went into effect on May 1 will be stripped away on Aug. 28. 
The bill also removes the requirement that the minimum wage be indexed to inflation, which has been in place since 2007
The paid sick leave and minimum wage provisions passed with 58% of the vote in November as Proposition A, garnering support from unions, workers’ advocacy groups, social justice and civil rights groups, as well as over 500 business owners. 
“Workers are earning paid sick leave right now,” said state Sen. Patty Lewis, a Democrat from Kansas City, “and then it’s going to get taken away and they’re going to be fired up about it.”
GOP critics have portrayed paid sick leave as a “job killer” that would hurt small businesses. The bill was sponsored by state Sen. Mike Bernskoetter, a Republican from Jefferson City, and Republican state Rep. Sherri Gallick of Belton. 
Senate Democrats have been in negotiations with Republicans over the last month to modify the bill, in what they’ve said is an effort to maintain the will of the voters in expanding paid sick leave rather than gut it entirely, as well as make it easier for businesses to comply.
State Sen. Tracy McCreery, an Olivette Democrat, said senators have “worked tirelessly to figure out some kind of compromise.” 
The Democrats spent two nights blocking a vote on the paid sick leave repeal earlier in the session.
Under Proposition A, employers with business receipts greater than $500,000 a year must provide at least one hour of paid leave for every 30 hours worked. Employers with fewer than 15 workers must allow workers to earn at least 40 hours per year, with larger employers mandated to allow at least 56 hours.
The measure made sick leave guaranteed for 728,000 workers who lacked it statewide, or over 1 in 3 Missouri workers, according to an analysis from the progressive nonprofit the Missouri Budget Project. 
Richard Von Glahn, policy director for Missouri Jobs with Justice, the organization that helped lead the campaign for Proposition A, said it’s a slap in the face to voters that will create “disgruntled employees” and cause “chaos” for businesses.
“Proposition A was passed so overwhelmingly, with so much support from Republican voters, it seemed that it would be so controversial in the legislature that Republican politicians would be more hesitant than they apparently are,” he said, “to overturn the will of their own voters, and cause them economic pain.”
The message lawmakers are sending is: “They don’t believe that you deserve economic security,” he added. 
It could also cause backlash for the lawmakers from districts who supported the measure, he said. 
“We’re going to make sure that workers don’t experience this as something that just happens to us without understanding these are decisions made by people, and workers have the ability to hold people accountable for those decisions,” he said.
Von Glahn said it’s not the end of the fight for paid sick leave, and advocates will consider putting it on the ballot again as a constitutional amendment, a move that would make it much harder for lawmakers to repeal. 
“I’m confident,” he said, “this is a policy that Missourians want and we’re going to continue to fight for that through every means necessary.” 
 Republican fractures 

 Sen. Mike Cierpiot, R-Lee’s Summit, speaks on the Senate floor on Feb. 10, 2021 (screenshot courtesy of Senate Communications).
The debate Wednesday afternoon began about 12:30 p.m. and Democrats held the floor for much of the time. But near the start of the debate, state Sen. Mike Cierpiot, a Lee’s Summit Republican, aired his grievances with the leadership of Missouri Right to LIfe.
Cierpiot accused the organization, one of the most visible anti-abortion groups in the state, of focusing more on enforcing purity of thought and maintaining its influence within the GOP than writing laws acceptable to most Missourians.
Amendment 3 reinstated abortion rights lost in 2022 when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. If Missouri Right to Life’s leaders had not demanded a ban with no exceptions for rape or incest, he said, Amendment 3 might have been defeated.
“Their leadership, Ms. (Susan) Klein, and Mr. (Dave) Plemmons and Mr. (Steve) Rupp have been much more interested in causing Republican brush fires over issues with much smaller or no impact on the huge effort for life,” Cierpiot said. 
The problems with Missouri Right to Life was evident in the 2024 elections when it made single-candidate endorsements, freezing out candidates who had been ardent anti-abortion legislators. The organization endorsed then-Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft in the Republican primary for governor, then refused to endorse Republican nominee Mike Kehoe for the general election.
Other Republicans who won without the endorsement of Missouri Right to Life joined in the criticism. State Sen. Mary Elizabeth Coleman, a Republican from Arnold, said the law triggered by the 2022 abortion decision was negotiated in spite of Missouri Right to Life, not with its help.
“I don’t know that I really care, frankly, that they didn’t endorse me,” Coleman said. “What I do care about is that they didn’t endorse Gov. Kehoe in the primary, and they didn’t endorse him in the general.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/051425_abortionaccess1-1024x615.jpg,,,2025-05-14 20:04:42.767525

It was a stark escalation of Democratic lawmakers’ opposition to the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.After the incident, Menendez detailed how ICE agents “pushed, physically assaulted two female members of Congress.” Several Republicans on the panel that oversees Homeland Security, including Chair Mark Green of Tennessee, said there should be consequences for the Democrats, such as criminal charges.Green accused one of three Democrats of assaulting a law enforcement officer.“This behavior demands a swift and firm response, and I assure you, action will be taken,” Green said.Arizona GOP Rep. Eli Crane suggested there be criminal charges lodged against the Democratic members and Republican Rep. Andy Ogles of Tennessee suggested to Noem that she “look into actions (to) be taken if a member assaulted” law enforcement.The top Democrat on the panel, Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, slammed Noem for the incident.“Instead of following the law, masked ICE personnel stopped and assaulted the members,” he said. “Then, to make matters worse, instead of launching an investigation into the incident, your department lied to the press about the situation and threatened to arrest members of Congress for doing their job.”One of the Democrats who was at the detention center protest, McIver, sits on the committee, but she did not speak to Noem about the incident.“This is not about me,” McIver said, and instead pressed Noem about international students who had their visas revoked.Focus on Abrego GarciaDemocrats criticized Noem and the Trump administration's aggressive immigration enforcement that has led to swift deportations and concerns about a lack of due process.They especially focused on Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man who was wrongly deported to a prison in El Salvador.Rhode Island Democratic Rep. Seth Magaziner called Noem’s leadership of DHS “sloppy,” and said it has led to immigrants and even U.S. citizen children being wrongly deported.“Instead of enforcing the laws, you have repeatedly broken them,” Magaziner said. “You need to change course immediately before more innocent people are hurt on your watch.”California Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell asked Noem if Abrego Garcia was given proper due process.Swalwell said he was defending due process and held up a poster that showed Trump holding a picture of Abrego Garcia’s hand that digitally added “MS-13” tattoos to his knuckles.He asked her several times if the photo was doctored. Noem did not answer the question but said she was unaware of the image.Instead she said that even if Abrego Garcia were returned to the United States, he would be immediately deported. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled the Trump administration must facilitate the return of Abrego Garcia but he remains in El Salvador.Crane asked Noem if she supported suspending habeas corpus, something that top Trump officials such as Deputy White House Chief of Staff Stephen Miller have floated.Habeas corpus allows people who believe they are being unlawfully detained to petition for their release in court, and it’s used to challenge immigration detention. It’s currently the only avenue that Venezuelans subject to the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 have to challenge their deportation under the wartime law.“That's not in my purview to weigh in on,” Noem said. “This is the president's prerogative to pursue, and he has not indicated to me that he will or will not be taking that action.”The U.S. Constitution allows for habeas corpus to be suspended “in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.”Crane argued that unauthorized immigration counted as an “invasion,” and therefore could be used to suspend habeas corpus.Habeas corpus has been suspended four times in U.S. history, during the Civil War; in almost a dozen South Carolina counties that were overrun by the Ku Klux Klan during reconstruction; in a 1905 insurrection in U.S. territories in the Philippines; and after the Pearl Harbor bombing in Hawaii.FEMA dismantlingThompson grilled Noem about the president’s comments wanting to dismantle FEMA.Noem said that she is supportive of Trump’s policy.“The president has been clear that he wants to empower states to give them the opportunity to build out their response,” she said.She said that while the federal government will be there for support, that local and state governments “know what they need.”Thompson asked Noem if she had a plan for the federal government responding to natural disasters.Noem said while there is nothing in writing, “the White House is coming forward with a plan…that will be making recommendations.”GOP Rep. Carlos Gimenez of Florida, said that while he supports efforts to “reform FEMA,” he stressed to Noem that “we can’t leave those who can’t fend for themselves.”",,,,2025-05-14 20:04:42.767525

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Frontline workers at Butler Hospital unable to reach a new contract with hospital management will walk off the job starting at 6 a.m. Thursday, despite a push by state lawmakers to coax both sides back to the negotiating table.
A May 8 letter to Butler Hospital President & COO Mary Marran signed by 44 legislators calls on the management of Rhode Island’s only private, nonprofit psychiatric hospital to negotiate a new contract with SEIU 1199NE workers, whose last labor contracts expired on March 31. 
SEIU 1199NE represents nearly 800 professional and clerical staff, registered nurses, mental health workers, and housekeeping and dietary staff at the hospital on Blackstone Boulevard in Providence. The workers are demanding higher wages, pension program access for future employees and greater attention to workplace safety. The union announced April 25 that its members had voted to authorize a strike.
“None of us want to strike,” Ashley Ouellette, an R.N. float nurse who has worked at the 168-bed hospital owned by Care New England since 2016, said in a phone interview. She is a member of the union’s executive board and bargaining committee. 
“Nobody cares about these patients more than we do,” Ouellette said. “As scary as it may be, we’re going to do whatever we have to protect the work that is done here.”
Butler Hospital frontline caregivers working without contract want more safety precautions

A message from Marran to the Butler community posted Wednesday on the butlerinfoforyou.org website indicated a strike appeared imminent.
“Please know we have worked hard to try to reach a satisfactory agreement with the union, but so far have been unsuccessful in these efforts,” Marran wrote. 
“No doubt the days ahead will challenge us all. I want to take a moment to express my heartfelt care and concern for each and every one of you. Whether you will be participating in the picketing or remaining on duty to help care for our patients, you are the staff that make this organization a leader in behavioral healthcare and your dedication and hard work are deeply valued and appreciated.”
A post on X by the city of Providence warned that traffic may be significant Thursday morning on Blackstone Boulevard, especially on the north side where Butler’s entrance is.
The 22 state senators and 22 state reps who wrote the letter to Marran expressed concern that the pending strike “would impact patient care, overwhelm our emergency rooms, and place additional strain on state resources.” Butler serves some of the most vulnerable individuals in the state, with nearly 70% of patients relying on Medicaid or Medicare.
The legislators’ letter claimed the majority of Butler workers earn under $20 an hour, with some as low as $15.30. Marran disputed those figures in an email to Rhode Island Current clarifying key facts about the hospital’s best, last and final proposal to the union on May 7.
“Only 20% of Butler’s union employees currently make under $20 per hour, not the overwhelming majority,” Marran said. “Under our latest proposal, that number would drop significantly within weeks of ratification, and by the end of the contract, 99% of our current union workforce would be above $20 per hour. We also offered substantial raises, preserved the pension for all current employees, guaranteed lower health plan contributions, and committed to partnering with the existing Health and Safety Committee on further improving staff safety.”
Marran said she wanted the community to be aware that Butler will remain open and continue to provide care for patients. “We are committed to reaching a meaningful agreement with the union and continuing to provide safe, compassionate, and uninterrupted care to the community we proudly serve,” she said.
The cost of bringing in replacement workers will leave Butler with fewer resources in future proposals to the union, Marran said, She did not confirm how much the hospital will have to spend to cover the striking workers.
SEIU 1199NE Executive Vice President Jesse Martin claimed the hospital planned ahead to bring in temporary labor at a cost of $1.8 million.
The union said Wednesday there were 116 open positions at Butler. 
“We have lost some really, really incredible staff to go work at other hospitals in the state or even out of state because of the wages here,”  Ouellette said.
Staff shortages have impacted staff training and onboarding, which union members say contributes to diminished workplace safety.
SEIU 1199NE says patient assaults on staff increased 41% between 2022 to 2024 while 95% of Butler caregivers say Care New England was not doing enough to keep them safe at work.
Ouellette said a friend and fellow nurse at the hospital is out of work with whiplash after being punched in the face by a patient a few days ago.
“We can’t have new staff training new staff. That happens here and it’s terrifying,” Ouellette said. “I’ve seen it happen multiple times and I know my coworkers have seen it happen multiple times. Like there’s absolutely no reason that a person who’s been here for a couple of months should be training. They’re still learning.”

(FWP photo)When Tom Millett, a Republican state lawmaker from Marion, was working at a nuclear powerplant on Lake Michigan nearly 30 years ago, he routinely found himself face to face with zebra mussels. 
The small freshwater mollusks are not native to North America, but were introduced into many waterways east of the Mississippi River in the 1980s, including the Great Lakes and have spread prolifically, earning a moniker as one of the most dangerous invasive species on the continent. 
For Millett, zebra mussels would routinely coat parts of the power plant that connected to the freshwater lake.
“We had to go in there and we had to actually physically remove the zebra mussels all the time,” Millett said. “And I can just tell you stories about zebra mussels, that we would take them out in big, huge dumpsters. By the dumpster load. That’s how prolific these things are.”
In an 2024 environmental review for the Palisades Nuclear Plant on Lake Michigan, it was reported that zebra mussels still coated parts of the intake system, an inch-and-a-half thick. 
To prevent a similar problematic infestation of Montana waterways, Millett carried House Bill 242 during the 2025 Legislative session, increasing the fines for anyone who knowingly or negligently introduces any aquatic invasive species into Montana or fails to stop at a watercraft check station.
Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte signed the bill on May 5.

Aquatic invasive species include plants, animals and pathogens that are not native to the state, and can harm the ecosystem and economy. 
Mussels are one of the common poster species for AIS prevention. 
Montana doesn’t yet have a major problem with Zebra mussels, or the similarly invasive quagga mussel, but neighboring states do, and there have been several suspicious detections of mussels and their larvae in Montana waterways, including Canyon Ferry Reservoir and the Missouri River. 
Montana Fish Wildlife and Parks runs a program to counteract aquatic invasive species, which includes a public information campaign and numerous AIS check stations that all boaters in Montana, including non-motorized ones such as canoes and stand-up paddleboards, are required to stop at for inspection. 
Out-of-state boaters must also obtain an inspection before launching on Montana waters. 
In 2024, FWP officials reported intercepting more than 47 mussel-fouled boats, and 800 transporting aquatic weeds. 
According to the state’s AIS inspection dashboard, FWP reports that watercraft check stations have already intercepted 10 mussel-fouled boats in 2025. 
The new law essentially doubles the fine for a first negligent offense as well as subsequent offenses for introducing AIS or failing to stop at an inspection station— from $500 to $700 for a first offense and from $750 to $1400 for subsequent offenses. 
In addition, knowingly attempting to introduce an invasive species to Montana, a felony, now has a fine of as much as $25,000. 
“Is that tough? It’s absolutely tough, because we can’t risk having AIS being introduced into Montana to hurt our fishing industry, our tourism industry, our hydro facilities, our water treatment plants or any of our industries that employ thousands of Montanans,” Millett said during a hearing on his bill in February. “We need to send a message to everyone who wants to come to Montana that we are serious about keeping our waters clean now and for future generations.”
Millett’s bill was supported during legislative hearings by researchers with the Flathead Lake Biological Station, the Montana Association of Conservation Districts, Montana Audubon, The Fishing Outfitters Association of Montana, Trout Unlimited, and the Little Bitterroot Lake Association. 

The threat of AIS, specifically zebra and quagga mussels, comes with a drastic price tag. 
A 2019 study published by the University of Montana’s Flathead Lake Biological Station estimated that if mussels colonized all of Montana’s water bodies, it could cost the state between $384.5 million to $731.4 million in mitigation costs, lost revenue and property value losses.

Prevention efforts, by comparison, are cheap. 
Montana spent more than $3.6 million running its inspection and decontamination stations in 2018, and operates a grant program that disseminates more than a half million dollars for invasive species-related prevention. 
In 2024, the Fish, Wildlife and Parks and partners conducted more than 130,000 watercraft inspections across the state, resulting in 47 citations and 91 written warnings. 
Under the law signed last week, the increased fines leveraged against violators would be funneled into the state’s general fund. 
FWP officials remind all Montanans that boaters and anglers must remember to clean, drain and dry their watercraft before leaving a water access site and are required to stop at all open watercraft inspection stations. 
Nonresidents and residents returning home must have their watercraft inspected before launching in Montana. Watercraft must also be drained of all water before transporting.

When Karina Lariz was released from a California prison in September 2021, she had only the clothes she was arrested in — stretched out and weathered by time. She had lost her home, her car and her job. Her two children had moved in with other family members.
“I didn’t have nothing, everything that I had within those two weeks of coming home was what I found in donation bins,” recalled Lariz, who was incarcerated for three years. She added: “I was so worried about, ‘How am I going to get to these different programs? Where am I going to sleep at?’”
After her release, Lariz spent two days at a motel before moving into a transitional home. She also participated in a job training program.
Then came an unexpected lifeline: direct cash payments through a nonprofit program called the Returning Citizens Stimulus. The Center for Employment Opportunities, an organization that offers reentry support and services to formerly incarcerated people in 28 cities, runs the program.

With the money, Lariz, 35, was able to buy clothes for job interviews, cover groceries and public transportation fare, and begin rebuilding her life and relationships. The money, totaling nearly $2,500 over three payments, helped her gain footing in the weeks following her release — a period often marked by high risk of recidivism and reincarceration.
“It liberated a lot of stress,” she said.
Now, a new independent evaluation of the initiative suggests that short-term aid may have positive long-term effects. The study comes as some states are considering whether direct financial support is an effective — or appropriate — tool for reducing recidivism.
In 2022, Lariz landed a job with the very organization that helped fund her reentry. She now works as a program associate on the organizing team at the Center for Employment Opportunities, where she helps others leaving prison.
Nearly four years after her release, Lariz is married and again living with her two children.
“If I didn’t have that support, I would have not pushed myself to do half of the things that I did,” Lariz said.
She is one of more than 10,000 formerly incarcerated people across 28 cities who received support through the Center for Employment Opportunities’ stimulus program, which launched in April 2020.










If I didn't have that support, I would have not pushed myself to do half of the things that I did.


– Karina Lariz, cash assistance recipient


The national organization works with local agencies to distribute up to $2,750 in cash over 60 days, contingent on participants completing basic milestones, such as creating a resume or attending a job readiness workshop. More than 80% of participants complete their milestones and receive the full payments.
People leaving prison often face staggering rates of joblessness, homelessness and food insecurity. Most program participants used the funds to cover food, rent, utilities or public transportation fare. Some participants also used the money to pay off credit card and medical debt.
“The basics of survival are this acute challenge in those early days of reentry, and then you layer on that sort of the big structural challenges,” said Sam Schaeffer, the executive director and CEO of the Center for Employment Opportunities. “Just putting food on the table, just getting to work, just getting that set of interview clothes is so critical.”
The new study supports that assessment.

According to the study — which was conducted by MDRC, a research organization focusing on poverty reduction — participants were significantly less likely to violate parole than peers who did not receive payments. Within the first six months after release, parole violations fell by more than 41%, with violent parole violations dropping by 64%. The study evaluated the outcomes of people who were released in 2020 in Los Angeles and Alameda counties in California.
Roughly 77 million Americans — or about 1 in 3 adults — have a criminal record, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. That includes records of arrests, charges and criminal convictions. Formerly incarcerated people often face stigma and major barriers in the job market.
They also often return home without savings or financial resources and earn less than half as much as peers who have never been incarcerated over their careers, according to a 2020 report by the Brennan Center for Justice, a left-leaning law and policy institute at the New York University School of Law.

Legislation and pilot programs

A bill introduced in the New York legislature earlier this year would create a reentry fund to offer cash payments of $425 each month for up to six months for eligible residents leaving prison. The bill has been stalled in committee since January and is unlikely to pass before the legislature adjourns in June.
Some critics say that the proposed New York program is a redundant and unrestricted handout for people with criminal records, and question whether limited public safety funds should support individuals already eligible for state services, including Medicaid, food assistance, job placement programs and housing aid.
“This is just one more element of what is an overall theme by the Democrats here in Albany to coddle criminals and put their priorities over the priorities of victims and law-abiding citizens,” New York state Sen. George Borrello, a Republican, told Stateline.

This isn’t the first time states have considered offering stipends to people leaving prison.
Most recently, legislators in Colorado in 2024 and North Carolina in 2023 proposed bills that would have provided monthly payments to formerly incarcerated individuals. Neither bill made it out of its originating chamber, but both bills proposed up to $3,000 in support.
In Colorado, the pilot program would have offered money for basic living expenses to those who enrolled in workforce training programs following incarceration in a state facility. In North Carolina, the proposal would have provided monthly stipends for housing, food, clothing and transportation for up to six months after release.

Similar pilot cash assistance programs have launched in New Haven, Connecticut; Gainesville, Florida; and Philadelphia.
The Gainesville program, which ran from January 2022 to February 2023, had 115 participants. They received $1,000 in the first month, followed by monthly payments of $600. An impact report released in February found that participants experienced greater financial security, reduced mental stress and lower rates of recidivism.

Potential savings

In 2022 — the most recent year with available data from the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics and the U.S. Census Bureau’s annual survey of state and local government finances — state governments spent $58 billion to incarcerate more than 1 million people in state facilities.

Forty-four percent of all state prison admissions in 2021 were people who violated the terms of their parole or probation sentences, according to a 2024 report by the Council of State Governments Justice Center. On any given day, 1 in 4 people in state prison were incarcerated due to supervision violations — costing states more than $10 billion collectively.
Some critics maintain that the most effective way to prevent crime is to punish those who break the law.
“We do not do enough to hold people accountable,” said Borrello, the New York state senator who opposes the bill that would create a reentry fund in his state. “I really don’t give any credence to [supporters’] thoughts on whether or not they think this is going to save money down the road.”
For people such as Karina Lariz, though, the impact is personal and profound.
“I’ve been able to redefine and find who I am today, like the real Karina — not the Karina that grew up in trauma and all the problems that I had before incarceration,” she said.

(Courtesy photo)When Marissa Munoz took her oldest child to an urgent care clinic in Albuquerque 16 years ago, she didn’t know what Medicaid was until the staff explained to her how it could cover his treatment, and how to apply.
Now, with congressional Republicans threatening to gut Medicaid, she can’t imagine life without it.
Munoz lives in the South Valley, just outside Albuquerque. Originally from Juarez, Mexico, she came to the United States 23 years ago. Her three other children are still minors and also enrolled in Medicaid.
On Sunday, House Republicans released a plan that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates would cut $715 billion to Medicaid funding, which could translate to more than $1.1 billion in cuts here in New Mexico, according to budget experts. On Tuesday afternoon, the U.S. House of Representatives panel in charge of overhauling Medicaid voted to move the proposal, which also adds work requirements for eligibility, forward.
Munoz told Source NM in an interview lawmakers in Congress should be aware of how the communities they represent benefit from Medicaid coverage, specifically for mental health treatment.
“If they’re going to cut those benefits, then that problem is going to get worse,” she said.
Munoz said her 13-year-old son has autism, thyroid issues and developmental delays. Every three months since he was a baby, medical staff have tested his blood and scanned his body with an MRI machine. Medicaid has covered the cost of those visits, and allowed her to seek second opinions when needed, she said.
Other students bullied Munoz’s son for being disabled, which led him to try to take his own life on two separate occasions. “He’s been going through a lot,” she said.
Munoz’s son now needs a weekly visit with a counselor at his school, which is also covered by Medicaid. The counselor helps him process his emotions, she said.
“Without Medicaid all these years, I don’t know how I would have done all this,” Munoz said. “I wouldn’t have been able to afford all of the treatment and care for him, let alone his medication.”
In interviews with Source NM, health care advocates in New Mexico said the proposed cuts would hurt not only patients but also rural hospitals, which heavily rely on Medicaid to pay for their operations.
New Mexico Voices for Children health policy analyst Monica Otero  told Source NM that Medicaid covers about 61% of New Mexican children, and 55% of births.
“Consistent health coverage really plays a role in reducing birth complications and health outcomes for birthing parents and children,” said Otero, who is pregnant herself and learning the importance of prenatal and perinatal care.
Arika Sanchez, health care director at the New Mexico Center on Law and Poverty, said if New Mexico experiences these cuts, they would impact children, people with disabilities, elders, veterans, people working low-wage jobs that don’t provide health insurance, people in nursing homes and caregivers.
“Cutting Medicaid and putting on these work requirements just to increase barriers for people who get their health insurance through Medicaid, all of this is just an excuse to fund tax breaks for really wealthy people and corporations,” Sanchez said. “It really prioritizes profit over the care of our communities.”
Two months ago, Munoz said she and her family also enrolled in the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP), because she divorced her husband and she needed to make ends meet.
On Tuesday night and into Wednesday morning, the U.S. House Agriculture Committee held a markup on the Republican tax bill, which would cut $290 billion in SNAP benefits. SNAP provides Munoz’s family with $356 per month in food assistance, which she said covers a lot but not all of their food expenses.
“As a single mom, it’s hard to provide good food for the kids,” she said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
For the past four years, Munoz has worked part-time as a parental advisor for the nonprofit Partnership for Community Action, where she helps parents learn how to care for children aged zero to 5 years old, advocate for themselves, receive public benefits and get connected to different organizations around Albuquerque.
Munoz said her experience caring for her 13-year-old son has taught her about how Medicaid works, and better equipped her to help address the needs of parents facing similar situations with their own disabled children.
“It’s hard for parents to tell their kids, ‘I’m sorry, we don’t have a meal today,’” Munoz said.
If lawmakers also cut funding for SNAP, then that will only make it harder for families to succeed by taking the time to interview for jobs, she said.
Sanchez said when the government takes health care away from families, people put off going to the doctor, don’t receive preventive care and wait to receive care until they can’t put it off any longer, often leading to emergency room visits that are more expensive for them, the hospitals and the state.
“These cuts will not only impact families and patients but also providers, hospitals and our overall health care system,” she said.
Munoz asked lawmakers to consider what they would do if they got into an accident, or needed to see a doctor, and did not have certainty that the care would be paid for.
“I want the people in charge to think more about our community, because not everyone has the opportunity to have a good job,” she said. “Parents are going through a lot, and having these benefits is meaningful for them.”

(Danielle Prokop / Source New Mexico)According to New Mexico officials, for the last three years, the National Nuclear Security Administration has failed to pay its share toward monitoring the environment around federal installations in the state.
Unless the federal government makes up that funding, Source has learned, independent monitoring of air, water and ecology around Los Alamos and Sandia National Labs could stop at the end of the month.
“My concern is that the state of New Mexico and our citizens will not have an independent review of the impacts the labs are having,” New Mexico Environment Department Resource Protection Division Director Rick Shean told Source NM. “Without this funding, going forward we’re not going to be able to sample and monitor the environment for ourselves in order to ensure that the data that they’re collecting is true.”
NMED has operated water, air and environmental monitoring projects at LANL and Sandia since 1990, and later included the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant near Carlsbad.
“We’re verifying they’re not impacting the environment and public health around their facilities,” Shean said. The bureau does not regulate the sites but does release data to the public on its findings.
The work is funded by a U.S. Department of Energy grant, which was developed as part of an agreement between the state and federal government.
Previously, one office in the Department of Energy paid for the grant funding the oversight bureau at NMED. In recent reshuffling at the federal level, the National Nuclear Security Administration was assigned to foot part of the bill. Currently, NMED’s Department of Energy Oversight Bureau has 16 employees and a budget of $4.3 million. The NNSA has failed to pay its share for the past three years, Shean said. For this year, that amounts to a $750,000 gap, approximately 17% of the budget for the state oversight program.
Without the funding, NMED would have to stop the current monitoring work at the national laboratories on May 30, Shean said. WIPP monitoring would still continue.
Compounding the missing funding, Shean says new federal projects are putting more strain on existing employees. For instance, Shean noted LANL’s new plan to start venting pent up barrels of tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen, possibly in June, which would increase the monitoring workload for the oversight bureau.
Shean said he received assurances on May 9 after a meeting with NNSA officials, that federal funds would be available by May 16.
In an emailed statement, the NNSA said it issued a partial payment to NMED, but did not disclose the amount.
“NNSA will continue to incrementally fund its portion of the funds for the remainder of FY 2025,” the statement said. The statement concluded by saying the agency would pay NMED by the close of the fiscal year. It’s unclear if that indicates the federal fiscal year (in September) or New Mexico’s fiscal year, which ends in June.
NMED spokesperson Drew Goretzka confirmed to Source NM that NNSA sent a partial payment to the agency but said the NNSA statement to Source does not reflect previous commitments the federal government made. Source has a pending request for more specifics on the amount of the payment that was made.
“That timeline does not line up with what they presented to us in meetings in which they are going to deliver the funds by this Friday, May 16,” Goretzka said in a phone call. “We’re still under the impression they’ll deliver the funds by then.”

Gov. Gavin Newsom today called for the closure of another prison in his new budget proposal, which would be the fifth facility closed under his watch, though he didn’t specify which institution now has a target on its back. 
The closure, which Newsom proposed take place by October 2026, would happen despite the implementation of Proposition 36, a new California law that is predicted to briefly increase the number of people in the prison system. 
“While Proposition 36 is expected to increase (the prison) population, the population should continue its downward trend over the long-term,” Newsom said in the proposal. 
Newsom’s proposed budget pledges that a  prison closure would save about $150 million annually. He called for the shutdown as part of his plan to close a $12 billion deficit.
The Legislative Analyst’s Office has calculated that California’s prison population — which, despite Prop 36’s additional inmates, is still estimated to start dropping again in 2027 — could allow Newsom to close as many as five more prisons, saving $1 billion a year. 
Instead, in last year’s budget cycle and in the new budget proposal, Newsom has taken a more cautious approach to trimming prison beds. Last year, he proposed closing 46 housing blocks inside 13 state prisons but declined to call for a total prison closure. 
Advocates for prison closures welcomed Newsom’s announcement. 
“I am relieved that Gov. Newsom has taken a step in the right direction by announcing an additional prison will close in 2026,” said Amber-Rose Howard, executive director of Californians United for a Responsible Budget, a coalition that advocates for reduced incarceration. “In the midst of an extremely difficult political moment, where Californians are suffering budget cuts to life-affirming programs, prison closures are a smart solution to offset some of those cuts.”
At the inmate population’s peak in 2006, California locked up 165,000 people in state prisons. Today, after a decade of sentencing changes, federal court intervention and a surge of releases tied to COVID-19, California’s prisons house about 91,000 people. 
The Newsom administration expects to spend about $13.6 billion on the prison system next year. 
Newsom has already moved to close four prisons over the course of his administration. He projects that those shutdowns will save the state $3.4 billion by 2027.
So far, Newsom closed the Deuel Vocational Institution in Tracy in 2021 and the California Correctional Center in Susanville in 2023. He ended a lease with a privately run prison called the California City Correctional Facility, and the corrections department removed the last prisoners from the Chuckwalla Valley State Prison near the Arizona border in October.
Some of those communities fought back, notably in Blythe, where the city hired a PR firm and attempted to lobby for the Chuckwalla facility’s survival. So far, the governor’s office has not shown any signs of reversing course. 
California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation spokesperson Terri Hardy said in a statement that the department will make its facility choice based on its own guidelines. 
Those guidelines, spelled out in the California penal code, dictate that the criteria for closing prisons include the age and condition of the facility, its geographic proximity to other prisons, the economic impact to the local community and the programming available to incarcerated people at the facility.  
The corrections department “is committed to managing its resources efficiently to best serve the people of California,” Hardy said. “The state would support the affected local community and workforce with an economic resiliency plan, and workers would be offered transfers to nearby facilities.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/051425-California-Correctional-Center-GC-Getty-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-14 19:07:31.013777

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd)LOUISVILLE — As Republicans in Washington advanced a proposed Medicaid work requirement Wednesday, two Kentucky advocates speaking in Louisville disagreed on the wisdom of the policy. 
A House committee chaired by U.S. Rep. Brett Guthrie, R-Bowling Green, approved a plan for trimming  $625 billion in federal Medicaid spending over the next decade that includes new copays and work and reporting requirements. The vote is an early step in moving the changes, part of a massive tax and spending bill, through both chambers of Congress. The federal Medicaid work requirement would not take effect until 2029, under the bill approved by Guthrie’s House Energy and Commerce Committee during a marathon session that lasted 25 hours.

The federal-state Medicaid program pays for almost 1 in 3 Kentuckians’ health care.
The Louisville Forum already was planning to host a debate around the question: Will changes to Medicaid  “heal or hurt?” after Medicaid also took center stage in Kentucky’s 2025 legislative session. 
Deborah Yetter, a Kentucky Hall of Fame journalist who writes for the Lantern, moderated the Wednesday panel between Jim Waters, president of the Bluegrass Institute for Public Policy Solutions, and Emily Beauregard, executive director of Kentucky Voices for Health. 
On work requirements 
Waters and Beauregard spent a large chunk of the debate discussing the ins and outs of Medicaid work requirements. 
During the legislative session Kentucky lawmakers added a mandated work requirement for Kentuckians  between the ages of 18 and 60 who don’t have dependents and are both “physically and mentally able to work.” 
Waters said that “there’s going to be some hurt whenever you try to rein in a program that’s really exploded in cost” and said Medicaid “was intended to be for the truly disabled, indigent.”

“It was not meant to be a destination,” he said. “It was meant to help along the way.” 
“Contrary to maybe what some people think, there is not an automated taxpayer machine there in Frankfort,” he said. “I mean, taxpayers are not an endless source of resources, so resources are limited, and they need to be spent in a way that actually helps people.” 
Beauregard said “we don’t need work requirements for Medicaid” and said reporting requirements often lead to administrative hurdles that keep people from being able to prove their employment, such as hard-to-prove seasonal work or literacy issues. 
Beauregard said work requirements are “short sighted” because “it is a prerequisite to work that you are healthy.” 
“While we do spend a decent amount of money on Medicaid, the cost of being uninsured is much greater — and it’s not only greater to the individual, it’s greater to our entire economy and to our health care system,” she said. 
For Waters, Medicaid is “unsustainable” as it is. 
“Don’t we want fewer people on Medicaid? I think that should be the goal,” Waters said. “Fewer people on Medicaid means when people are in the private workforce getting coverage from employers, are independent, are experiencing the dignity of work and effort,” he said. “If everybody, pretty much, is working …. that’s receiving Medicaid benefits now, like I’ve heard, and then it’s a very small percentage that aren’t, what’s the problem with implementing a program that gets the rest of those folks onto an employer’s payroll and off of the taxpayers’ benefit plan.” 
On fraud
Lawmakers have cited fraud prevention as a motivator to more thoroughly oversee and rein in Medicaid. 
Beauregard said “there’s very little fraud for individuals” and that fraud is “mostly in the provider arena, and it’s not widespread.” 
“Individuals aren’t able to take advantage of their Medicaid coverage for nonmedical purposes,” she said. “You can’t take your Medicaid card and use it to purchase groceries or go on a vacation. Very few people are getting a root canal for the fun of it.” 
Waters believes “there’s more fraud that we even know right now” and called on the newly established Medicaid Oversight and Advisory Board to “be aggressive in looking at what fraud is happening and the extent of it.” 
“Taxpayers deserve to know what that is, and to have somebody looking at that,” he said.

Photo by Eric Thayer/Getty Images)U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem accused three New Jersey House Democrats Wednesday of “lawlessness” by appearing at a new migrant jail in Newark on Friday and scuffling with federal agents after the agents arrested Newark Mayor Ras Baraka.
Noem, speaking before the House Committee on Homeland Security, called the Democrats’ actions “beneath this body.” Federal officials have already said they are considering charges for the three, Reps. Rob Menendez, LaMonica McIver and Bonnie Watson Coleman.
“Members of Congress should not break into detention centers or federal facilities,” Noem said Wednesday. “Had these members requested a tour, we certainly would have facilitated the tour.”

Menendez, McIver, and Watson Coleman have been at the center of controversy since Baraka’s arrest at the new migrant jail, Delaney Hall, which Baraka says is operating without required city permits. Videos of the melee that erupted when agents arrested Baraka show McIver pushing past a federal agent, a moment the Department of Homeland Security has highlighted on social media. McIver has alleged that agents assaulted her and Watson Coleman and “roughed up” Menendez.
The three House Democrats say they visited Delaney Hall as part of their oversight duties. They have refuted the claim that they broke into the facility, and they blasted a resolution introduced by Rep. Earl Carter (R-Georgia) that would strip them of their committee assignments. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Georgia) said Wednesday that McIver should be expelled from Congress entirely.
“This is just another attempt to distract from the reality of what Republicans are seeking to do: strip healthcare away from 13.7 million Americans and slash programs that strengthen our communities and make them healthier,” they said in a joint statement. “As we all know, Members of Congress have a legal right to conduct oversight at any DHS detention facility without prior notice, and that’s exactly what we were doing last week. This week, we’re back in Washington doing exactly what New Jerseyans sent us here to do: delivering for them.”
Republicans on the House’s homeland security panel echoed Noem’s criticism Wednesday.
“When you punch a law enforcement officer, that’s not the law enforcement officer’s fault. This behavior demands a swift and firm response, and I assure you action will be taken,” said Rep. Mark Green (R-Tennessee), the committee’s chairman.
Much of the hearing Wednesday centered around issues like due process for legal residents facing deportation and border security. But some members defended their fellow Democrats about the Delaney Hall matter.
Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Mississippi) said he’s “never seen anything like” the way Congress members were treated Friday, calling it “a sad day.
“Even when the secretary, my Republican colleagues, and I had strong disagreements, we still had productive conversations, and did our duty to keep America safe, but that’s not the case any longer,” he said. “My colleagues across the aisle have sold their souls or at least their spines to Donald Trump. They try to cover the administration’s lies and blame Democrats for doing the job our constituents send us here to do.”
Rep. Nellie Pou (D-09) called it “disturbing and certainly dangerous” that federal officials would publicly threaten to arrest members of Congress.
Baraka is scheduled to appear in federal court Thursday on a trespassing charge. 
The mayor, who is among six vying for the Democratic nomination for governor on June 10, was at Delaney Hall Friday as part of a series of protests outside the facility. On Wednesday, he shared video showing federal agents allowing him inside the gate that separates the jail from the street.
“Nobody was kicking or shoving like the coverage suggests. We were invited in,” he said.
Other videos from Friday show federal agents asking Baraka to leave the property and Baraka walking to the street-side of the gate before agents arrested him.
On Saturday, Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin told CNN that Menendez, McIver, and Watson Coleman could be arrested. Noem didn’t comment directly on that Wednesday.
In a press release Wednesday, McLaughlin repeated the claim that the three House Democrats stormed the facility, and said they can’t “break the law in the name of ‘oversight.’”
McIver is a member of the House’s homeland security panel. When Noem appeared before it Wednesday, McIver didn’t respond to Noem’s or Republicans’ criticism of her and her Democratic colleagues, and instead grilled Noem on workplace conditions and collective bargaining rights for Transportation Security Administration agents and the revocation of international students’ visas without due process.
“A lot has been said, and I expect a lot more will be said about the department’s interactions with members of this body when it comes to oversight,” McIver said. “But this is not about me.”

The House Environment Committee is starting to explore how the state could reintroduce an apex predator. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Final Reading: What would it take to bring cougars back to Vermont?.","A mountain lion. Photo via Adobe StockRight now, the closest answer to the question of “What would catamounts in Vermont look like?” may be an AI-generated image of the large cat in a state forest, or perhaps it’s UVM’s felted Rally Cat mascot cheering from the sidelines of a hockey game.But soon, the House Environment Committee hopes to flesh out that image a little further and launch a feasibility study for what reintroducing cougars to the Green Mountain State would entail. (Had to!)Jed Murdoch, a wildlife biologist at UVM’s Rubenstein School of Environment and Natural Resources, joined the committee Wednesday to explain the role of apex predators in an ecosystem and to walk through what would need to happen to reintroduce the animals to Vermont. (BTW, cougar = catamount = panther = mountain lion — and the list goes on. The Puma concolor holds the record for the mammal with the most English names) These big cats have been officially considered extinct in the state since 2018, though the last known cougar in Vermont was killed in 1881. You can see him at the Vermont History Museum.Rep. Amy Sheldon, D-Middlebury, said she’s been interested in exploring cougar reintroduction as part of her broader mission toward a “connected and functioning landscape,” she said in an interview. Though the state’s Fish & Wildlife Department already has a full plate, Sheldon believes facilitating the cascade of ecological processes that can come from the introduction of a keystone species may actually lighten that load. “Mother nature will heal herself if we give her the tools to do so,” Sheldon said.But that doesn’t mean you’ll be seeing cougars lurking near your favorite mountain trails next week, next month, or even next year. The committee is still figuring out what a feasibility study would need to contain and how to fund it. Murdoch said any study should include an assessment of the habitat across the state that would be suitable for the catamount and where they’d be likely to appear. He also suggested analyzing projected movement patterns with an approach called “circuit analysis” that maps potential pathways the animal might take from protected area to protected area. Food availability is another big factor to consider. Murdoch estimated that one mountain lion eats somewhere between 14-20 deer a year. Though deer populations in the state are booming now, would they be able to keep up with this top-down pressure after years of predation? A study should address that, he said. Also, it’s important people really understand what reintroduction could mean, and that there is support for reintroduction across the region for the reintroduction of animals that roam across wide areas, Murdoch said. “I think (for) a lot of our folks here, it’s a warm and fuzzy thing, but I don’t think they understand the reality of doing (a reintroduction). The first and foremost question should be, what’s in the best interest of the cougar?” said Rep. Chris Pritchard, R-Pawlet, during the hearing. “Is this really the right thing to do for the cougar?”It’s a question, Sheldon expressed, that gets at the heart of the need for such a study.— Olivia GiegerIn the knowFor roughly 22 months, the former site of the Montpelier Post Office has sat vacant, a lonely looming presence at the corner of State and Elm streets. The building sustained significant damage from the July 2023 flood, when water inundated the streets of Vermont’s capital. It was so hastily vacated that federal employees’ items are still sitting on their desks, creating an “eerie” feeling, according to Jon Copans, executive director of the Montpelier Commission for Recovery and Resilience. Now, the city and state are considering whether it may be worth buying the property at 87 State St. from its owner, the U.S. General Services Administration. The General Services Administration announced it would begin the disposition process in December 2024. On April 21, it sent a letter to Montpelier and the state of Vermont about the possibility of a negotiated sale, similar to a “right of first refusal” for government actors before it becomes available to the general public, Copans said. Read more about how the state and city are weighing the purchase here. — Erin PetenkoOn the moveA marquee infrastructure financing program that’s meant to spur housing in smaller towns has passed a key hurdle in the Legislature – but Gov.

The legislation would raise the sales threshold to $30,000.The Senate’s revisions to H.401 introduce a comprehensive cottage food product category, defining low-risk foods that can be produced in home kitchens that will receive licensing exemptions. Eligible products include non-perishable baked goods, candies, jams, pickles and other non-refrigerated items.Liz Wirsing, Director of Food and Lodging at the Vermont Department of Health expressed support for the amended version of the bill in testimony before the house agriculture committee on Wednesday. She called the bill a “compromise,” balancing food producers’ interests with public health concerns.Producers must still file forms with the health department and follow strict guidelines for food preparation, including online food safety training. Canned goods, which were initially excluded from the bill, must meet specific pH and processing standards in order to be sold.“People want to see support for small food enterprises,” Caroline Sherman-Gordon, Legislative Director of Rural Vermont, said in an interview. The cottage food bill would alleviate some of the “bureaucratic” costs many Vermonters see when starting a small business, she said. — Izzy WagnerVisit our 2025 bill tracker for the latest updates on major legislation we are following.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Final Reading: What would it take to bring cougars back to Vermont?.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Mountain-Lion-Cougar-Catamount-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-14 19:07:31.013777

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota student leaders say they have a lot of unanswered questions after lawmakers passed a law requiring schools to be cellphone-free.
Members of the Superintendent of Public Instruction’s Student Cabinet met Wednesday in Bismarck to discuss new legislation that will affect students. 
Senate Bill 2354, which takes effect Aug. 1, prohibits public school students from having access to cellphones and other electronic devices in school from “bell to bell.”
But the students raised a lot of questions lawmakers may not have considered. Some students said laptops provided by schools are “horrible” and wondered if they could continue using personal laptops to do school work.
Another student said she views digital versions of her textbooks on a tablet so she doesn’t have to carry heavy textbooks all day.
Yet another student said she’ll miss using her phone to access the digital calendar she uses to keep track of homework, after-school practices and appointments.
“I see a lot of uncertainties with a lot of the exceptions the students were bringing up,” said Bridger Rivinius, a junior at Gackle-Streeter Public School. “I feel like it might be a slight overreach for the state government to have to be involved with that.”
Gov. Kelly Armstrong was among the supporters of the bill. He has said it will help the next generation of students emotionally and academically.
Gov. Armstrong advocates for eliminating student cellphone use in public schools

The law requires cellphones to be silenced and stowed away in an inaccessible location during the school day. It gives school boards flexibility to craft their own policies around school-related noninstructional time, such as dances and sporting events. 
It also mandates that school districts collect data to measure the impact of the new policy on student behavior, mental health, disciplinary incidents, school attendance and academic performance.
Gwyn Marback, a facilitator for the student Cabinet, said she expects there will be some “fumbles” as school boards try to address issues with their new policies.
“They (state lawmakers) didn’t think of everything,” Marback said. “Hopefully, there’s common sense when things arise.”
Sophia Johnson, a sophomore at Bismarck Legacy High School, said her school has an open campus policy that allows students to leave school during lunch or a free period, which could be an issue in implementing the policy at her school.
“It might be a bit of a disaster,” Johnson said. “We have the open campus and we really want to focus on the 21st Century learning and that involves using our phones.”
She said some courses, such as media class, require students to use their phones to participate.
“All of that stuff is going to be really inhibited by this,” Johnson said. “It really should be up to the teachers because they know their students the best. They know what’s happening in their classrooms and they know how to work their students.”
Aidan Pelton, a senior at Watford City High School, said his school already implemented a zero tolerance cellphone policy. He said kids still have their phones in school, but fewer than before the policy was implemented.
“I like the bill. I just think there’s going to be a lot of problems with it,” Pelton said. “I don’t really love the less control at the school level. But, I think it is overall a good thing to have no phones in schools.”
Addyson Rademacher-Nyame, an eighth grader at Mandan Middle School, testified in favor of the legislation at the Capitol. She said she finds it encouraging that each school board will be able to craft its own policy.
“It’s going to be very interesting, especially this first try. It’s going to be good to see the positive and negative results of it right away,” Rademacher-Nyame said. 
She said legislative fixes might be needed during the 2027 session to address problems that arise from implementing the bill.
“Every school in North Dakota is different,” she said. “I want to see every angle about how every school developed and adapted to this bill and we’ll go from there.”

Ibarra,,,,,https://calmatters.org/health/2025/05/medi-cal-coverage-weight-loss-drugs-newsom-california/,Weight loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy would no longer be covered by California's health insurance for low-income people under the governor’s proposal.,"In summary
Weight loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy would no longer be covered by California’s health insurance for low-income people under the governor’s proposal.



Popular weight loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy would no longer be covered by Medi-Cal under a proposal unveiled by Gov. Gavin Newsom Wednesday in an effort to reduce cost overruns in the state health insurance program.
The costly drugs prescribed to fight obesity have been driving up the cost of Medi-Cal, the state program that provides health coverage for low-income Californians. Eliminating coverage for these drugs would save the state $85 million in 2025-26, and up to $680 million by 2028-29, according to the governor’s office. 
Newsom’s proposal will be taken up by the state Legislature as the governor and top legislators tackle a state budget facing a $12 billion deficit.
As proposed, coverage of the drugs would end on Jan. 1, 2026. Medi-Cal patients trying to lose weight would have to pay for the prescriptions themselves, at a cost of more than $1,000 per month, making it unattainable for low-income people.
Some health professionals say the drugs are highly effective at combating obesity, a chronic disease that drives up health care costs because it can lead to many other disorders such as heart disease and diabetes.
An estimated 18 million adults in California are obese or overweight, according to the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research. 
“This is a bad decision. The people who are already taking this medication, what’s going to happen to them?” said Liz Helms, president of the California Chronic Care Coalition, a group of health consumer advocacy organizations and providers. 
The California Association of Health Plans said Newsom’s proposal “should send a strong signal to the Legislature that they should reconsider mandating that health plans cover these costly drugs for weight loss without the proper clinical safeguards in place.” 
California is not required by federal law to cover the cost of the weight loss drugs in its Medi-Cal program. Instead, the state opted to include them. Under Newsom’s proposed cuts, when Ozempic is prescribed to treat diabetes, it would still be covered by Medi-Cal.
Newsom’s proposal comes as Wegovy and Ozempic prescriptions among Medi-Cal enrollees are soaring along with overall prescription drug spending. In fiscal year 2023-24, drugs cost Medi-Cal close to $15.2 billion, according to state drug cost reports. That’s about a 10% increase from the previous year. 
Between 2022 and 2023, Wegovy prescriptions in the Medi-Cal program jumped from 15,000 to 181,000, data from the U.S. Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services show. Ozempic prescriptions for diabetes and weight loss rose from 178,000 in 2022 to 480,000 in 2023.
In 2023, the latest year for which data is available, Medi-Cal spent about $733 million on both drugs. (This amount does not include the refunds that Medi-Cal received from pharmaceutical companies as part of rebate programs.)
“This is a bad decision. The people who are already taking this medication, what’s going to happen to them?”LIZ HELMS, CALIFORNIA CHRONIC CARE COALITION 
In his budget presentation today, Newsom did not mention the drugs. But he said the state had to “tighten things up” in its massive Medi-Cal program so he proposed several restrictions, including a freeze on Medi-Cal enrollments by people who lack permanent legal immigration status. Medi-Cal covers nearly 15 million Californians.
Earlier this year, the state had to backfill a $6.2 billion shortfall in its Medi-Cal budget to pay providers through the end of June. The Department of Health Care Services, which oversees the Medi-Cal program, cited a number of reasons for going over budget, including the state’s expansion to undocumented immigrants and an increase in prescription drug spending.
Ozempic is primarily used to treat Type 2 diabetes, but some doctors prescribe it for weight loss, too. Wegovy is used only for weight loss. Both are manufactured by Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk, and there are no generic versions.
Semaglutide, the active ingredient in both drugs, works by mimicking the GLP-1 hormone, which helps regulate blood sugar and appetite. In an attempt to contain costs, Medi-Cal already limits the quantity of Wegovy that can be dispensed every 28 days to one carton of four pen injectors. Patients inject themselves once a week. 
To qualify for Medi-Cal, a single person’s annual income cannot exceed $21,597. For a family of 4, the threshold is $44,367.

Kseniia Petrova has been held in ICE custody for roughly three months, including for a week at a Vermont prison, after authorities say she failed to declare frog embryo samples when she arrived by plane from France.

Photo by Bob LoCicero/VTDiggerBURLINGTON — A federal judge in Vermont is weighing whether she has the authority over a case of a Harvard Medical School scientist from Russia who claims she is being wrongly held in custody by federal authorities.Chief Judge Christina Reiss heard arguments Wednesday morning in U.S. District Court in Burlington in a case brought by Kseniia Petrova, a genetics researcher. Petrova, 30, has been held in detention since February when, according to court filings, she arrived at Boston Logan International Airport from France and did not properly declare research samples — frog embryos. She was eventually placed in the custody of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.Petrova, who had her visa revoked by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, was held at Vermont’s women’s prison in South Burlington for about a week before she was transferred to an ICE facility in Louisiana, where she has been held ever since. Petrova’s case is the third high-profile immigration matter to come before federal courts in Vermont since President Donald Trump took office in January. The other cases involved a Columbia University student living in Vermont and a Tufts University student who was held in custody for a short time in the state. Both students have since been ordered released from custody by separate federal judges in Vermont.  Petrova brought her legal action, a habeas petition, in Vermont while still in custody in the state, alleging she was being unlawfully held by federal authorities. The federal government filed a motion seeking to dismiss that complaint, contending that the matter, at least at this point, should be playing out in an immigration court in Louisiana and that the federal court in Vermont lacked jurisdiction.Reiss, the judge, listened during Wednesday’s hearing to more than an hour of arguments on the jurisdictional issue. She said as the hearing came to a close that she was taking the matter under advisement and set a bail hearing in the case for May 28.“I will see you on May 28 at 10, unless I decide that the court has no authority to go forward,” Reiss told the attorneys as the hearing came to a close. “We may even have the hearing anyway, and I will tell you what I’ve determined with regard to that.”Throughout the hearing, the judge challenged the positions of attorneys on both sides of the case, often interjecting questions as they spoke.Reiss, speaking to Jeff Hartman, a trial attorney from the U.S Department of Justice who represented the Trump administration at Wednesday’s hearing, said an immigration court process could take months or years to play out.“This is not going to happen anytime soon,” Reiss said to Hartman, adding, “And if she is, in fact, unlawfully detained, that’s exactly what a habeas petition is for.”“If she believes that her removal proceedings, which are ongoing in Louisiana, are unlawful or contrary to the Constitution, you know, she can bring a claim,” Hartman replied. “We think the proper venue for that question is Louisiana, where she’s detained.”Reiss questioned that response. “But in this case, her habeas petition was filed here when she was here,” Reiss said. “And, the Supreme Court has said, ‘Yeah, even if you move somebody the court retains habeas jurisdiction,’” the judge added. “Otherwise it would create an adverse, perverse incentive to move somebody around the country and say, ‘Oh, now you’ve got to file in Louisiana. Oh, you’re in Ohio now, file there.’” Petrova took part in Wednesday’s hearing remotely from the ICE facility in Louisiana where she has been detained for the past three months. The courtroom gallery in Burlington was filled with her supporters, several wearing clothing emblazoned with “Harvard.” The case has received national media attention, and an essay from Petrova appeared this week in the New York Times titled “I Came to Study Aging. Now I’m Trapped in ICE Detention.” In the initial filing in federal court in Vermont, Petrova’s attorney described the incident leading to her custody as an “inadvertent failure to declare on a customs form non-hazardous, noninfectious, and non-toxic frog embryos that she was bringing to the United States at the request” of a leader of a researcher group at Harvard Medical School “under whose leadership she works.” Such cases, according to Petrova’s attorney Gregory Romanovsky, often result in a fine and the forfeiture of the undeclared items.  Petrova, the filing stated, had entered the United States on a valid visa in May 2023 and had been conducting “groundbreaking scientific research” at Harvard. She had traveled in and out of the country several times since then without issue, the filing added. She traveled to Europe in late January, her attorney stated in the filing, and prior to her return, a leader of a research group at Harvard asked her to bring back samples of frog embryos from his scientific collaborators at the Institut Curie Centre de Recherche in France.“She simply placed the samples in her luggage and did not declare them to CBP at the time of her entry” to the United States at Boston Logan International Airport, according to the filing. At the luggage conveyor belt, the filing stated, Petrova was approached by a CBP officer and escorted to a room for questioning and examination of luggage.After finding the undeclared items, “and despite her attempts to explain,” the CBP officer marked her visa in her passport as “cancelled,” according to Petrova’s attorney. The officer then gave Petrova a choice, the filing stated, to withdraw her application for admission and apply for a new visa from overseas or face expedited removal and the possibility of being barred from admission to the United States for five years.She asked that her application be withdrawn and requested to return to Paris, according to the filing. Petrova, the filing stated, said she had no fear of returning to France, but “did have a fear of returning to Russia, where she faced past persecution for her political activities.” The filing then stated, “CBP subsequently apprehended and detained” Petrova.Petrova, in her New York Times essay, stated that she had been arrested in Russia for protesting the war in Ukraine.  In a statement, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said Petrova was “lawfully” detained after “lying to federal officers about carrying substances into the country.” The statement added, “A subsequent K9 inspection uncovered undeclared petri dishes, containers of unknown substances, and loose vials of embryonic frog cells, all without proper permits.”Petrova, in a court filing, denied the allegation of lying to federal officers, and her attorney reiterated that denial during Wednesday’s hearing.Judge Reiss asked Hartman during the hearing Wednesday if the federal government was ultimately seeking to deport Petrova to Russia.“Yes,” Hartman responded. Romanovsky, Petrova’s attorney, said after the hearing Wednesday that he looked forward to a bail hearing for his client later this month in federal court in Vermont. “We’ll ask for Ms. Petrova to be present at the bail hearing in person,” he said. “We’ll have an opportunity to present witnesses to show that she is not a danger to the community and not a flight risk.” Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont federal judge hears arguments in case of detained Harvard scientist from Russia .",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Champlain-College-4-24-18-750363-scaled.jpg,,,2025-05-14 19:07:31.013777

(Photo by Getty Images)Both chambers of the Iowa Legislature passed changes to Iowa’s unemployment insurance taxes Wednesday, sending Gov. Kim Reynolds’ proposal to her for final approval.
Senate File 607, brought forward by Reynolds early in the 2025 legislative session, would cut the taxable wage base used to calculate unemployment insurance taxes in half from 66.7% to 33.4%.
 It includes other changes, like reducing Iowa’s unemployment tax tables, and excludes wages paid from employers to employees working in other states from the definition of “taxable wages” if the other state extends reciprocity to Iowa.
The bill passed the Senate 32-16 and the House 59-27. In the House, Rep. David Young, R-Van Meter, said Iowa is in a good position when looking at the amount of money in the state’s Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund — $1.95 billion — but said there have been questions “legitimately” raised about what would happen to the fund in the case of a recession or economic downturn. 
Though the bill contains decreases to the taxes going to this fund by decreasing the taxable wage base, Young said changes to the tax rate are triggered under current law — and retained in the bill –if the balance of the fund falls below $941 million.

“Our state’s unemployment rate is 3.4%, and with an unemployment insurance trust fund at almost $2 billion, the sound argument is being made that we’ve been over-collecting — especially compared to other states,” Young said. “The proposal before us saves employers and businesses approximately $975 million over five years, injecting that back into the private sector.”
Democrats proposed multiple amendments in both chambers, including measures to reverse Iowa’s cuts to unemployment in recent years, each of which failed. One Senate amendment would have waived work search requirements for people with seasonal employment.
In the Senate, lawmakers opposing the legislation said it does not help workers but benefits the companies that lay them off, causing residents to find work in another state rather than try to figure out a complicated, burdensome system that won’t provide aid for as long as they need. 
“Our unemployment system is rigged for the employers, particularly with this bill,” Sen. Molly Donahue, D-Marion, said. “It is the workers who hold those businesses up, and we need to do better by those workers, not give more breaks to the employers who are laying them off.” 
Sen. Bill Dotzler, D-Waterloo, said he was “ashamed” of Senate Republicans for how they’re treating workers with the legislation by not allowing more time to take advantage of benefits and helping businesses more than employees. 
Providing unemployment insurance to Iowans doesn’t mean they’re just being handed a check, Dotzler said, it means they have the time to better themselves for employment while they seek it and won’t have to worry as much about finances in the process. 
One of the House Democrats’ amendments proposed requiring savings for employers through the bill be used to increase employee salaries or benefits — a suggestion, not requirement, under the current legislation.
Democrats argued during debate on the bill in the House the unemployment funds need to be available for Iowans in need, and that businesses should not necessarily be trusted to use tax savings on better compensation for workers. Rep. Lindsay James, D-Dubuque, said “the reason the fund is full in the first place is because this body, the majority party, voted to strip workers’ benefits.”
“The money in this fund was never meant to go back to the big corporations,” James said. “It was meant to go to workers, and that’s where it should be going. … This isn’t policy. It is corporate theft.”
Young said most of the claims made by Democrats were factually inaccurate, saying the measure does not provide an “corporate income tax break,” and does not cut any unemployment benefits.
Sen. Adrian Dickey, R-Packwood, called concerns brought up by Democrats “old, tired talking points,” and said the problems they worried about with previous unemployment legislation have not come to fruition. Iowa’s population grew between 2023-2024, he said, countering statements that Iowa is losing workers in favor of going to other states with better pay, benefits and unemployment programs. 
For the lawmakers who said the process to apply for unemployment is too complicated, harming those who need aid, Dickey said they’d be happy to know that Iowa Workforce Development will launch updated websites and materials this summer. 
Dickey acknowledged there are flaws in the current system, including the state’s unemployment fund, and said the Legislature should take time next year to take a hard look at how unemployment works in the state. However, Iowa is third in the nation for average weekly rate of benefits at just over nine weeks. He asked why Iowa would want to be like its neighbors, which have longer averages. 
“The Republican Party has been the party to stand up for Iowa workers,” Dickey said. “We are the party that wants our workers to aspire more than desiring an unemployment check.”
Reynolds released a statement celebrating both chambers passing the measure.
“Passing this bill means nearly $1 billion in savings over five years for Iowa businesses of all sizes,” the governor said in a statement. “Thank you to our legislators and key stakeholders for their support to help attract new business to Iowa and place existing businesses on a level playing field with our neighboring states.”

The bills that passed included Legislative Bill 383, from State Sen. Tanya Storer of Whitman, requiring that, starting in July 2026, anyone wishing to create a social media account in Nebraska must prove they are 18 years old or older. Younger users would need parental permission. A parent would also need to prove they are 18 years old or older.

LB 383 also includes the provisions of LB 172, from State Sen. Brian Hardin of Gering, outlawing using artificial intelligence or computer generation to create pornographic images or videos depicting someone younger than 18 years old, or knowingly and intentionally receiving such content.
Both measures were priorities of Gov. Jim Pillen and Attorney General Mike Hilgers, as was LB 140 from State Sen. Rita Sanders of Bellevue.
LB 140 would require all of Nebraska’s 245 school districts to prohibit student use of cellphones and other personal electronic communication devices during most parts of the school day beginning this fall. School districts would retain wide latitude in implementing such a policy. Most already have one.
LB 383 passed 46-3. LB 140 passed 48-1.

Lawmakers also approved LB 246, from State Sen. Barry DeKay of Niobrara at Pillen’s request, to ban the sale of lab-grown meat. Some lawmakers, including conservative State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston, as well as the Nebraska Farm Bureau, preferred to label rather than ban the products, which aren’t currently available in Nebraska markets.
LB 246 passed 38-11 and would take effect three months after lawmakers adjourn. The last day is scheduled for June 9.
Lawmakers also advanced housing supports for survivors of domestic violence and sex trafficking through LB 78, from State Sen. Eliot Bostar of Lincoln. It would increase the documentary stamp tax by 7 cents per $1,000 worth of property, which is on the transfer of real estate, a portion of which the state uses for affordable housing or homeless shelter assistance.
All new revenue would be directed to the new housing assistance. It passed 49-0 and would take effect three months after adjournment.

Senators also passed LB 559, from State Sen. Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln, chair of the Legislature’s Judiciary Committee, to outlaw unauthorized skimming devices and “kingpins” who use them, such as on ATMs, point-of-sale systems or fuel pumps. It passed 43-6.
The bill included LB 464, also from Bosn, a former prosecutor, to outlaw “organized retail crime,” a step up from strings of shoplifting depending on the value of merchandise stolen.
Other bills that passed on Wednesday include:

LB 32, from State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha, to allow candidates to use a post office box instead of a street address on political advertisements. A street address would still need to be on file with state officials. Passed 47-2.
LB 36, from State Sen. Tom Brandt of Plymouth, to establish the “Safe Battery Collection and Recycling Act” to collect and safely dispose of certain batteries, increase fees on Nebraska Game and Parks Commission park entry permits and expand allowable water recreation projects. Passed 43-6.
LB 80, from State Sen. Bob Hallstrom of Syracuse, would consolidate laws related to protection orders, extend ordered protection orders and renewals to two years instead of one, require child abuse involving a military family to be reported to the service member’s military installation and require landlords to change locks or remove a perpetrator of domestic violence from a rental agreement soon after abuse is documented and a protective or restraining order has been granted. Passed 46-3.
LB 133, from State Sen. Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue, to expand the definition of “law enforcement officer” to include animal control officers to enforce state or local animal control laws if authorized by a city, village or county. Passed 42-7.
LB 166, from State Sen. Jana Hughes of Seward, to require county treasurers to conceal the addresses of law enforcement, members of the Nebraska National Guard or judges if such a person applies to have their address withheld, which is currently the law for county assessors. Addresses for judges would also be concealed when they are up for retention elections. Passed 48-1.
LB 230, also from Hallstrom, to restrict and regulate the sale of kratom to those 21 years of age or older, classify tianeptine (“gas station heroin”) as a Schedule II controlled substance and prohibit the sale of nitrous oxide (laughing gas). Passed 49-0.
LB 257, from State Sen. Dan Quick of Grand Island, creates a pathway for marriage and family therapists from other states to be licensed in Nebraska and increases the minimum liability coverage needed for child care licensing. Passed 46-3.
LB 287, from State Sen. Terrell McKinney of Omaha, to give additional authority to cities of the metropolitan class (Omaha) to crack down on bed bug infestations and regulate housing authorities within metropolitan cities for pest control, regular inspections, property registrations, penalties or requiring updates to the city council. Passed 34-15.
LB 332, from State Sen. Brian Hardin of Gering, to create assistant funeral directors, permit pharmacists to dispense emergency refills in certain circumstances and require Medicaid coverage for psychology services provided by qualifying advanced-level practitioners supervised by a licensed psychologist. Passed 49-0.
LB 364, also from Quick, would allow the Legislature’s Executive Board, when the Legislature is not in session, to approve an “indication of intent” from the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission to move land into the state park system. Passed 46-3.
LB 526, from State Sen. Mike Jacobson of North Platte, to allow a public power supplier to pass on costs to or require additional terms and conditions of cryptocurrency mining operations, including if the operation necessitates infrastructure upgrades. Passed 49-0.
LB 561, also from Brandt, would create a special permit for overweight vehicles carrying raw milk up to 107,500 pounds. The Nebraska Department of Transportation would need to create a list of bridges that would and would not support the weight. Passed 49-0.
LB 660, from State Sen. Bob Andersen of north-central Sarpy County, would require state agencies to regularly review regulations and repeal unnecessary rules, mandate an updated inventory of federal funds the state relies on along with contingency plans in the event of reductions in federal support and permit legal challenges against rules or regulations in local district courts rather than only in Lancaster County. Passed 49-0.

(Courtesy of FM)A late-in-session bill aimed at helping Johnston-based insurance company FM is prompting new whispers down the State House’s marbled halls: Is Rhode Island at risk of losing another top employer?
Just the opposite, says Rep. Alex Finkelman, a Jamestown Democrat who introduced the House bill May 8 at the request of the Fortune 500 company, which rebranded from FM Global in July 2024. Gov. Dan McKee has also put his name behind the bill.
Finkelman confirmed in an interview that privately held FM, with its 8-acre Johnston corporate campus and 1,500-person state workforce (totaling 5,500 employees worldwide), is considering expanding its local presence. 
That’s why FM CEO Malcolm Roberts met with House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi in April to ask for legislation lifting restrictions on its investment abilities. Shekarchi said he later received a similar request from executives with Amica Mutual Insurance Co., based in Lincoln.
Shekarchi, typically noncommittal on legislation prior to a committee hearing, did not hesitate to show his support for the bill ahead of its initial hearing scheduled for Thursday, May 15, before the House Committee on Corporations.
“I appreciate dialogue from companies on ways the state can improve the business climate and level the playing field with neighboring states,” Shekarchi said in an emailed statement Tuesday. “I look forward to seeing this bill pass into law before the session concludes in June.”
The focus on keeping up with neighboring states sharpened for lawmakers and business leaders in the last year, after two major private companies, Citizens and Hasbro Inc., threatened to leave Rhode Island for Massachusetts.
Hasbro executives now expect to to provide an update on a potential relocation to Massachusetts this summer, while Citizens appears content to stay put after state lawmakers shepherded through a tax rewrite for its benefit in the 2024 legislative session.
The Citizens Bank bill, rushed through both chambers and signed into law in the final throes of the 2024 session, drew criticism from a small group of progressive lawmakers, who bristled at loss of state tax revenue ($15 million for a full fiscal year) to further boost the bottom line of a major financial services company.
Executives at FM have no plans to leave, despite a state law enacted in 1984 restricting its investments in long-term assets outside of stocks and bonds. Such nontraditional or alternative assets, currently limited to no more than 10% of total assets, could include hedge funds, private equity funds and real estate holdings. Finkelman’s bill would repeal the investment cap, letting local insurers invest as much as they want in what are referred to in federal reporting rules as Schedule BA investments.
“FM welcomes this proposal, which we believe will help support business growth and competitiveness in Rhode Island and enable insurance companies in the state to manage their investments with greater flexibility without compromising policyholder protection,” Rob Julavits, a spokesperson for FM, said in an email.
Julavits remained vague when asked about the company’s expansion plans in Rhode Island.
“FM is one of the largest private employers in Rhode Island,” Julavits said. “The company continues to grow and is currently hiring for a variety of roles. We believe this legislation would give us additional flexibility to support growth in Rhode Island, which has been home to our headquarters for nearly 200 years.”
Finkelman, owner and president of Warwick-based insurance agency The Egis Group, said FM’s cutting edge research, development and insurance of niche areas like solar panels and renewable energy could lead to new jobs for Rhode Islanders.
Keeping up with neighbors 
The bill also puts Rhode Island in line with neighboring states, a selling point for McKee.
“The Governor is committed to creating a level playing field for local companies, which is why he submitted this legislation to lift investment caps placed on Rhode Island-based insurance companies,” Olivia DaRocha, a spokesperson for McKee, said in an email. “Repealing these limits would align our state with Massachusetts and Connecticut, making Rhode Island a more attractive place to do business and ensuring our domestic insurers can compete on equal footing with their regional competitors.”
Massachusetts and Connecticut are among 10 states that do not limit investment in Schedule BA assets, Matt Touchette, a spokesperson for the Rhode Island Department of Business Regulation, said in an email.
Touchette referred questions about past investment limits in Massachusetts and Connecticut to their states’ respective business regulators. Mary Quinn, a spokesperson for the Connecticut Insurance Department, confirmed via email Wednesday that the state does not limit Schedule BA investments. However, a separate clause in Connecticut’s laws for insurers restricts company stock investments in a single institution at 5%, and non-stock investments in a single institution at 25% of assets.
The Massachusetts Office of Consumer Affairs and Business Regulation, which oversees insurance for the Commonwealth, did not respond to multiple inquiries for comment on Wednesday.
Repealing restrictions on local insurance companies’ investments might indirectly help consumers who could see premiums drop if the companies can improve their bottom lines, Finkelman said. By that same logic, if company profits suffer under riskier investment strategies, it might also hurt their policyholders.
However, state business regulators limit how much insurance companies can charge consumers, offering protections against dramatic premium spikes.
FM posted a nearly $3.4 billion profit on $8.1 billion in revenue in 2024, according to its annual report. It does not publicly report the number of policyholders, primarily commercial and industrial customers.
Amica posted an $84 million profit in 2024, according to unaudited financial statements.

Brendan Dowling, a spokesperson for Amica, expressed support for the law change in an emailed statement. 
“This change will help us manage our investments more effectively, allowing us to deliver stronger, more reliable support for our policyholders when they need us most,” Dowling said.
Dowling did not specify whether lifting the investment cap could reduce consumer costs for Amica’s 1.2 million policies, which center on individual insurance products like auto, home and life insurance.
Origins of 1984 law a mystery 
No one contacted for this story could answer why Rhode Island limited investment caps for insurers in the first place. Finkelman suggested hedge funds might have seemed too risky to lawmakers in the 1980s.
But nontraditional or alternative investments are now commonly accepted across industries, Finkelman said.
“FM and Amica are two of the most financially sound insurance companies,” he said. “I  have very little concern about them running into financial trouble by overleveraging themselves.”










FM and Amica are two of the most financially sound insurance companies. I  have very little concern about them running into financial trouble by overleveraging themselves.


– Rep. Alex Finkelman, a Jamestown Democrat


Insurance companies have been steadily increasing investments in alternative assets since at least 2010, searching for higher returns in a low-interest rate environment. The appeal of alternate asset classes increased further after 2017 regulatory changes adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), which reformed how companies could record exchange-traded funds on their balance sheets. 
Julavits declined to answer questions about the timing of the company’s requested state legislation — three months after the Feb. 5 deadline for state lawmakers to submit new bills under standard procedure during the 2025 session.
Even after Shekarchi met with FM in April, it took several weeks before the proposed legislation made its debut on the House floor.
“Nothing in government moves fast,” Finkelman said.
Lawmakers will have to act quickly to advance the bill before the session ends on or before June 30. 
A Senate companion bill sponsored by Sen. Andrew Dimitri, a Johnston Democrat, was introduced on Friday. A hearing has not been scheduled yet, Greg Pare, a Senate spokesperson said.
Senate President Valarie Lawson signaled preliminary support.
“Amica Mutual Insurance and FM Global (sic) are both longstanding, valued corporate citizens in Rhode Island,” Lawson said in an emailed statement. “While the specifics of the proposal to remove the investment cap will be reviewed through the public committee process, I am open to the idea. It appears that this would create a more welcoming, business-friendly environment and improve opportunities for job creation at no cost or risk to the state.

While performers put traditional dances on display in the Capitol rotunda, multiple booths offered information and advice for encounters with law enforcement as federal authorities ratchet up immigrant arrests and deportations.
Latino legislators, local business owners and faith leaders met with Oklahoma’s Republican governor on Wednesday about immigration policies and Oklahoma’s reliance on immigrant labor.

Arturo Alonso-Sandoval, D-Oklahoma City, during a news conference of the Oklahoma Legislative Latino Caucus on Wednesday at the state Capitol in Oklahoma City.

Latino lawmakers’ biggest ask, Sen. Michael Brooks said, was for the governor to follow through with his opposition to the Oklahoma State Department of Education’s proposal to have public schools collect students’ immigration status. Gov. Kevin Stitt previously pledged to block the proposed rule, saying “putting kids on a list is not something we should do.”
“That was well received,” Brooks, D-Oklahoma City, said. “The governor has continued to be able to maintain that he’s committed to making sure those rules do not go into effect.”
State Superintendent Ryan Walters has said he proposed the rule to better account for resources needed to serve immigrant students. He also said his administration would share the collected information with the federal government, if asked, and would support immigration raids in schools.
A resolution that passed the state Senate this week would reject the rule. It now advances to the House for consideration.

Stitt said he heard from leaders of various industries during the roundtable meeting Wednesday that the proposed rule had made some Oklahoma families “really, really scared and nervous about sending their kids to school.”
“They were just asking me to help them on that (and) be able to protect the young people in the state of Oklahoma,” Stitt said. “It’s a complicated issue. It’s an issue that normally is a political issue that nobody on my side of the aisle would jump in and say, ‘Hey, let’s attack this.’ So, I knew it was going to be political and people were going to come after me for it, but it’s the right thing to do.”
Stitt’s stance on the issue was a balm for families in Santa Fe South Schools, an Oklahoma City charter district where about 97% of the student body is Hispanic, said the district’s superintendent, Chris Brewster.
But, the district’s community is still experiencing crises and heightened anxiety with the growing number of deportations, Brewster said.

A month ago, he said, a Santa Fe South fifth grader learned his mother and other members of her roofing crew had been placed in immigration detention. Brewster said the boy and his mother had entered the country to seek asylum from violence in Honduras.
He said school officials scrambled to get in touch with the 11 year old’s mother, who is now slated for deportation, and to contact his estranged father, who now has custody of the child.
“This is not an isolated issue, and we have hundreds of these stories in our community,” Brewster said. “As a conservative Christian and an American, I don’t find this to be tenable, the way that we treat children, those that have been made in God’s image, that they should go through this type of turmoil and tragedy because of what’s taking place in our immigration system.”
The Oklahoma Legislative Latino Caucus, though in agreement with Stitt on the Education Department’s proposed rule, continues to oppose a bill the governor signed into law last year to create the state crime of “impermissible occupation.”
Scores of Latino Oklahomans gathered at the Capitol last year on Hispanic Cultural Day to protest the policy. A lawsuit challenging the law was refiled this week.
Wednesday’s festivities were a far cry from the large-scale protest that took place last year. With the added fears that the immigrant community now faces, Brooks said “having a huge event on the steps of the Capitol wasn’t the right thing to do this year.”

To meet uncertain times with music and dancing is a testament to the community’s temperament, said Rep. Annie Menz, D-Norman, a member of the Latino caucus who founded the Hispanic Cultural Day event.
“Whenever we feel like our community is coming under attack, it’s up to us to fight back,” Menz said. “We will remain prayerful that those (attacks) remain few and far between, and it’s in that spirit that we wanted to go back to our original format for this event and kind of lighten it a little bit and remind people we are no threat. Our community is no threat. We are your neighbors. We are your friends, we are your coworkers.”

(Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)Two Arkansas ballot question committees on Wednesday filed a motion to intervene in a federal lawsuit challenging new direct democracy-related laws. 
The American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas, Elias Law Group LLP and Shults Law Firm LLP filed the motion in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Arkansas on behalf of For AR Kids and Protect AR Rights. The former is a grassroots coalition that’s received approval from the attorney general to gather signatures for its proposed education-focused constitutional amendment. 
The latter plans to file its own proposed ballot initiative for the 2026 election to protect Arkansans’ “right to propose, sign, petition and campaign for ballot initiatives to improve their communities,” according to a Statement of Organization filed with the Arkansas Ethics Commission Friday. 
Protect AR Rights is composed of several groups, including Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, Arkansas Appleseed, Arkansas Citizens First Congress, Arkansas Public Policy Panel, the Arkansas State Conference of the NAACP and For AR People.
“This case is about protecting core political speech,” ACLU of Arkansas Legal Director John Williams said in a statement. “Arkansas voters have a constitutional right to speak out, organize, and propose laws through the ballot initiative process. The laws we’re challenging are deliberate efforts to suppress that speech and silence the voices of ordinary Arkansans in favor of entrenched political power.”
Arkansas attorney general rejects first ballot measure under new law

The original lawsuit was filed last month by the League of Women Voters of Arkansas who alleges eight recently approved laws governing direct democracy violate the First and 14th amendments to the U.S. Constitution. The case is assigned to Judge Timothy Brooks.
Arkansans can propose new laws or constitutional amendments and put them to a statewide vote through the direct democracy process. Arkansas is one of 24 states that allows citizen-led initiatives, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
The majority of the laws challenged in the lawsuit regulate the petition-gathering portion of the initiative and referendum process. New requirements include directing signature gatherers, known as canvassers, to sign a “true affidavit,” to request a photo ID from potential signers and inform them that petition fraud is a criminal offense, among other things. 
According to Wednesday’s court filings, the intervenors want to challenge additional laws, including a 2023 law that requires petitioners to gather signatures from 50 counties instead of 15 counties and Act 602 of 2025, which prohibits ballot titles from being written above an eighth grade reading level. Attorney General Tim Griffin cited the new law for the first time when he rejected a proposed ballot measure from the League of Women Voters last week. 
In Wednesday’s filings, the plaintiffs argue that intervening in the League of Women Voters lawsuit is more efficient than filing a separate lawsuit, which they said would likely be consolidated with the League’s complaint under federal court rules. 


Let us know what you think...


 

Legislators and supporters of the new laws have said they will bring integrity to the initiative and referendum process, while opponents argue they will make it nearly impossible for citizens’ proposals to qualify for the ballot. Protect AR Rights spokesperson Bill Kopsky called the laws “a blatant power grab by politicians trying to silence voters.”
“Direct democracy has been under attack in the Arkansas Legislature really since 2012,” he said. “Passing just bill after bill, it’s death by 1,000 paper cuts, making the process harder for people.”
For AR Rights formed in 2020 in opposition to Issue 3, a proposed constitutional amendment referred by the Legislature that would have changed the initiative and referendum process by requiring voter petitions to be submitted earlier and increasing the number of counties where signatures must be collected, among other things. Issue 3 failed with 56% voting against it.
Two years later, For AR Rights fought against Issue 2, another lawmaker-referred constitutional amendment that would have increased the percentage of votes required to pass constitutional amendments and citizen-proposed state laws from a majority to 60% of votes cast. Issue 2 failed with 59% of voters voting against it.
Arkansas AG certifies education coalition’s 2026 ballot proposal

Kopsky is also part of For AR Kids, which submitted and received approval for its proposed constitutional amendment for the 2026 general election after failing to collect enough signatures for the 2024 election.
After the conclusion of the 2025 legislative session, Kopsky said the group assessed the new laws and volunteers tried collecting some signatures to learn how difficult it would be to comply with the new requirements. The regulations were “so onerous that it’s nearly impossible to collect signatures,” which is why the group decided to seek to join the League of Women Voters’ lawsuit, he said.
“We just view ballot measures as a fundamental right in the Constitution, obviously, but we also see it as a way to cut through the partisanship that is caused by our politicians and special interests,” Kopsky said. “Arkansans tend not to be super political, which I love about us. It’s not about what camp you’re in, it’s what can we do to make our community better.”

Joseph Bellino (R-Monroe) told a large crowd outside the State Capitol Building Wednesday during the annual Unite to Face Addiction rally.
Bellino has been vocal about his struggles with addiction prior to his time in the Legislature, telling attendees there is a lot of shame in addiction and making mistakes because addiction, but there is pride in recovery.
“This is my favorite day of the year, when addicts outnumber assholes in Lansing,” Bellino said.

In Bellino’s first year as a lawmaker, he told the crowd that he befriended another legislator, a Democrat, and the pair would go to recovery meetings together, staying sober together. But the other state representative ultimately lost their fight with addiction, killing themselves in 2017.
About 17% of Americans aged 12 or older have experienced a substance abuse disorder, according to the 2023 report from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. In Michigan, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, or MDHHS, reported in 2024 that through efforts to provide harm reduction resources and recovery opportunities, Michigan’s overdose death rate declined five times faster than the national average.
Attendees listened to live music, laid flowers on the Capitol steps in honor of those who have experienced addiction and heard speakers advocate for hope in recovery.
The fight against addiction is a statewide fight, Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson, a Democratic candidate for governor, told the crowd and there needs to be belief in recovery, that generations of addiction can be broken if communities work together.
That’s the soul of the IGNITE program in the Flint area, Swanson said. IGNITE, which stands for Inmate Growth Naturally and Intentionally Through Education is a program in correctional facilities across the country that Swanson created to offer educational opportunities to those who’ve interacted with the justice system to have opportunities in the workforce. This week, Genesee County saw its 100th GED earned through the program since it launched in 2020.

“Keep fighting, fighting for the people, giving hope to people, believing in people, that’s what’s going to free people… not one person… on this stage, not one person on this lawn has not been touched by the disease of addiction and you are the one that needs to stand in the gap. So if you do your part, I do my part. We do our part, we will save lives every single day,” Swanson said.
Sobriety is an everyday commitment for many who’ve experienced addiction and not enough attention is paid to the level of grit and hope that’s required to take on the challenge of overcoming addiction, Chris Nixon, an addiction medicine specialist at Henry Ford Health told the crowd.
Reflecting the journey of his wife, who has been clean from opioid addiction for eight years and the loss of his father and brother to addiction, Nixon said there is honor in fighting against addiction.
Relapse is not defeat in addiction, Nixon said, perfection is not required, only a willingness to reset and start again. At a gathering of addicts and supporters like the Unite to Face Addiction rally, Nixon said there’s likely attendees that have relapsed within the last 48 hours, but their decision to attend a rally where several recovery organizations are offering contact info and advocates are ready to support is a testament to their commitment to strive towards sobriety again.

Housing advocates say a cap on the amount of state tax revenue set aside for the new CHIP program would severely limit the number of homes that could be built with its help, among concerns about other restrictions.

Emile Kornheiser, D-Brattleboro, speaks as the House Ways and Means Committee takes testimony at the Statehouse in Montpelier on Tuesday, April 8. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerThis story, by Report for America corps member Carly Berlin, was produced through a partnership between VTDigger and Vermont Public.A marquee infrastructure financing program that’s meant to spur housing in smaller towns has passed a key hurdle in the Legislature – but Gov. Phil Scott, senators and housing boosters say House lawmakers have added too many restrictions for the program to work.“It’s just much too complicated for anyone to understand, and will not be utilized by small communities,” Scott said at his regular Wednesday press conference. “It’s taking a step backwards.”The initiative, called the Community and Housing Infrastructure Program, would allow municipalities or developers to borrow money for infrastructure like water lines, roads and sidewalks for a particular housing project – and then use the increased tax revenue from the development to pay off the infrastructure debt.Proponents say it provides a new avenue to pay for costly public infrastructure – without the Legislature or municipalities needing to cut a check, or developers baking the cost into the price of housing. Critics have argued the tax incentive’s benefits don’t outweigh the foregone property tax revenue to the state’s overstretched Education Fund. In that vein, the House Committee on Ways and Means placed a $40 million annual limit on the amount of tax increment dedicated to housing project debt before advancing the bill on Wednesday.But housing advocates say that cap severely limits the number of homes that could be built through the program amid Vermont’s acute housing shortage.“Why do we want to cap the ability to see that housing growth happen, especially if we’re using this program to incentivize it in smart-growth areas, whether that’s rural or urban?” said Megan Sullivan, a lobbyist for the Vermont Chamber of Commerce.The tax-writing panel also added a test that would occur as part of each housing project application to determine whether a project would not have occurred without financing from the program. “There’s actually development happening all over the state,” said Rep. Emilie Kornheiser, D-Brattleboro, who chairs the committee. “We want to make sure that we aren’t putting public dollars towards projects that would happen regardless.”READ MORE
Yet CHIP’s proponents point out that Vermont is currently building less than half the homes needed annually in order to meet demand, ease housing vacancy rates and make progress on eliminating homelessness, based on several recent projections.House lawmakers also added a host of other rules to the program, including floor-area minimums for housing, location criteria, affordability incentives, and additional layers of oversight. Their version of the bill also sunsets Vermont’s existing tax-increment financing program in 2028, a move intended to assess its usefulness going forward, Kornheiser said.Taken together, the CHIP’s proponents say the House’s direction curbs access to the program too severely.“We would probably say they have put maybe so many guardrails in place that it keeps people out of being able to participate,” said Sen. Kesha Ram Hinsdale, D-Chittenden Southeast. The housing package that contains CHIP still needs to clear the House floor. After that, Ram Hinsdale said she expects the bill to ultimately land in a conference committee, where House and Senate lawmakers can hash out their differences of opinion.“This is by far the most significant housing action in front of the Legislature this session,” said Miro Weinberger, former Burlington mayor and executive chair of Let’s Build Homes, a new housing advocacy group that has thrown its weight behind the CHIP proposal. If lawmakers fumble the policy, he said, it “would just be a breathtaking legislative failure.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  This year’s main Vermont housing policy gets mired in legislative disagreement .",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/emilie-kornheiser-1-20250408-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-05-14 18:08:50.666591

SPRINGFIELD — Gov. JB Pritzker’s office is now projecting state revenues to come in about a half-billion dollars below the baseline projections assumed during his February budget address.

The latest downward revision comes as lawmakers are entering the final two-week stretch to approve a budget before their May 31 deadline amid increasing economic uncertainty.

While Pritzker’s office blamed changes made by the Trump administration for revenue shortfalls, the new fiscal reality is almost certain to make passing a budget more difficult as lawmakers are forced to consider approving new revenue streams or cutting state programs to make up the difference.

The Governor’s Office of Management and Budget lowered revenue projections for fiscal year 2026, which begins July 1, by $536 million from its February estimate. It’s a 1% decrease that puts the state on track to finish FY26 with $54.9 billion in revenue.

The change “is largely driven by the economic uncertainty and anxiety fueled by the Trump Administration and Republicans in Congress,” Deputy Gov. Andy Manar said in a statement.

“Their reckless economic policies have already triggered the first quarterly decline in the nation’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in three years and are driving up costs for working families,” Manar added. “This growing national instability poses a serious risk to Illinois’ continued economic progress and outlook.”

Income tax, federal funding changes

Projections for income and sales tax revenue in FY26 were lowered by 1% since February while corporate income tax expectations decreased by nearly 7%.

GOMB’s projection more closely aligns with a revision issued earlier this month by the Commission on Government Forecasting and Accountability, the General Assembly’s bipartisan forecasting commission. COGFA’s May 2 forecast projects FY26 will see $54.5 billion in revenue, compared to the $54.9 billion forecast by GOMB.

The roughly $400 million difference between COGFA’s and GOMB’s is driven by the fact that GOMB’s latest estimate includes tax code changes sought by the governor that will raise revenue beyond what’s in current law. Pritzker proposed a tax increase on electronic gambling and table games at casinos, pausing a transfer of sales tax revenue from motor fuel sales to the road fund, and providing temporary amnesty for individuals making delinquent tax payments.

Pritzker’s office decreased federal revenue expectations for FY26 by about 2%, but COGFA lowered expectations by more than 6%.

Pritzker in February proposed a $55.2 billion spending plan that would be fueled by $55.5 billion in revenue, including the proposed revenue changes. But now lawmakers must work to fit their spending priorities into a smaller window that was already tight. Pritzker’s introduced budget called for 1% spending growth in most areas of the budget outside education, pensions and health care costs.

Senate Democrats’ budget leader, Sen. Elgie Sims, D-Chicago, said he believes the governor’s office’s adjustment keeps with its recent tradition of “responsible and conservative revenue estimating” and that Pritzker was not too aggressive when he introduced his budget in February.

“It was looking at the information available at the time,” Sims said in an interview. “He made an adjustment call. After having more real data, he changed the estimate to reflect that.”

House Republicans’ budget leader, Rep. Amy Elik, R-Godfrey, said Pritzker’s adjustment was “sensible,” but he should have been aware of President Donald Trump’s plans and accounted for their effects when he introduced his budget. She added the state budget has also relied too much on federal funds to pay for state programs.

“We are now in a situation where we have so much reliance on the federal government that any little cut feels like a very big deal to Illinois,” Elik said in an interview.

Special session needed?

The Trump administration has made the budgeting process “much more difficult,” Sims said, and it is possible lawmakers will need to come back later this year to make changes to any budget passed this month.

“We have no idea what the federal government is going to do,” Sims said. “This is the most uncertainty we’ve had in a very long time. So it’s possible. Is it the preferred outcome? Absolutely not, but is it a possibility? Sure.”

Both Sims and Elik said lawmakers need to look closely at what the state is spending to make decisions about how to balance the budget with minimal revenue growth and without hurting key services.

""We’re looking at every line,” Sims said. “This is that point of the session where we gather information.”

Some Republicans are seeking to slash significant portions of the state budget. Rep. Jed Davis, R-Newark, a member of the far-right Freedom Caucus, suggested the budget could be reduced by $10 billion, but many of his recommendations eliminate capital projects that are not part of the $55 billion general fund budget. He also suggested reducing  pension contributions that are required by law.

Elik was more measured when discussing potential cuts.

“You can’t just do an across-the-board reduction of state spending,” she said. “I wouldn’t recommend that in any way. So I think you go department by department and line by line.”

Projections for the current FY25 budget that ends June 30 remain largely in line with expectations on the revenue end, although spending has outpaced revenues.

Both COGFA and GOMB expect the state will close the year with $53.9 billion in revenue, though corporate and sales tax income will end slightly lower than expected.

Spending for the year is so far trending 4% higher than what lawmakers budgeted for, according to GOMB, but nearly all of this comes from higher-than-expected pension payments. Recently enacted state law allows the comptroller to “pre-pay” pensions, meaning the comptroller can make pension payments earlier in the fiscal year. Generally speaking, that means spending could fall more in line with revenues as the fiscal year progresses.

Further cuts from Congress?

Congressional budget talks taking place this month could mean further cuts to federal funding for the state.

Congress is considering a plan that includes some substantial cuts to Medicaid and federal health care programs, including a 10% cut to the federal matching rate for states that provide health care coverage for undocumented immigrants.

Pritzker proposed eliminating a health care program for noncitizens ages 42-64 to save the state $330 million in FY26, but a $132 million program covering seniors remained in his proposal.

Pritzker has long warned the state will not be able to make up for any significant Medicaid cuts approved by Congress.

“The Governor has made it clear: he will only sign a balanced budget,” Manar said. “At the same time, he has warned of the devastating impact on working families if Trump and Congressional Republicans succeed in their cruel cuts (to) Medicaid, SNAP, and other critical safety net programs.”

Today, as an adult, I am still working on the side effects.”Leaders of Vermont’s Roman Catholic Diocese have heard many such comments over the years as they’ve paid out $34.5 million to settle 67 civil lawsuits alleging clerical improprieties dating as far back as 1950.But Wednesday saw officials in a different venue: U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Burlington, where the state’s largest religious denomination is seeking Chapter 11 protection in hopes of reorganizing its depleting finances.“I’d like to say thank you for having our voices heard,” the first speaker, who identified himself to reporters as Kevin McLaughlin, told Judge Heather Cooper. “This sort of thing leaves scars.”As part of the Chapter 11 process, all pending and future lawsuits have been placed on hold as 118 new accusers have submitted confidential claims to join the case as potential creditors — almost double the number of people who previously settled before the diocese filed for bankruptcy last fall.Although the bankruptcy court has no authority to rule on any of the sealed allegations, it allowed seven of the latest accusers to offer non-evidentiary “survivor statements” as a courtesy at a special session at Burlington’s Federal Building.“When the diocese filed for bankruptcy, it robbed those survivors of their opportunity to stand in front of a jury of their peers,” said Brittany Michael, the lawyer for a federally appointed committee representing creditors with abuse claims. “We know that the opportunity to speak in court can be an important part of the healing journey.”For two hours, speaker after speaker talked both generally and graphically, standing up and breaking down, as they remembered being anywhere from 6 to 15 when they were abused.“I immediately buried those memories, but I was forever changed,” said a man identified as Speaker 3. “I thought many times of committing suicide because it was so painful.”Other men spoke of continuing shame and stress, anxiety and depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and panic attacks, as well as failed classes and marriages and alcohol and drug dependence.READ MORE
“It has taken me decades to understand this monster has been responsible,” a man identified as Speaker 2 said of the priest who abused him. “All this time I thought I had been the only one. My only regret is not having the courage to come forward sooner.”The Vermont diocese is the nation’s 40th Catholic entity to seek bankruptcy protection because of clergy misconduct. Under federal law, it must present the court with a tally of its financial assets and liabilities. The judge then will decide whether to allow church leaders to develop a reorganization plan that would require approval from both the court and creditors.Abuse claimants are seeking church records detailing not only a reported $35 million tied to the diocese’s headquarters and state-level holdings but also all the local operations it oversees, starting with 63 parishes with an estimated collective worth of $500 million. The resulting findings are expected to spark future court debate on which assets can be used to compensate creditors.Vermont Catholic Bishop John McDermott attended Wednesday’s special session.“It is my sincere hope and fervent prayer,” he said afterward in a statement, “that today’s hearing will be a source of continued healing for the survivors who shared their stories and for all who have filed a claim against the diocese.”McDermott was installed as bishop last July, only to land in court just two months later.“The diocese is not filing this bankruptcy case in an attempt to avoid any responsibility,” the bishop said at the time in an affidavit. “Due to the number of civil cases and claims filed against the diocese and limitations of the diocese’s resources, the diocese determined that reorganization under Chapter 11 is the only way to fairly and equitably fulfill the diocese’s obligations to all survivors of sexual abuse.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  A new wave of Vermont Catholic abuse claimants has its day in court.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/VTD-Catholic-19-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-14 18:08:50.666591

(Perry Bennett | West Virginia Legislative Photography)The West Virginia Board of Education will pursue litigation over a recently-passed bill that gives lawmakers the ultimate authority over school board policies. 
The Republican-backed measure was designed to trigger litigation for a likely review by the state Supreme Court that will favor lawmakers’ side. 
The Legislature signed off on the bill earlier this year despite a clear voter rejection of a similar proposal three years ago. It became law last month without the governor’s signature.
“I move that the board pursue litigation to contest the constitutionality of House Bill 2755 regarding the board’s independent policy making authority,” said State School Board President Nancy White, who announced the legal challenge Wednesday at the board’s monthly meeting in Charleston. 
No other comments were made by board members about the litigation.
  Del. Mike Hornby, R-Berkeley
Bill sponsor Del. Mike Hornby, a Republican from Berkeley County, said he expected a legal challenge to the bill. He believes lawmakers have constitutional authority to intervene in education and noted the state’s near-bottom ranking in academic outcomes.
“I hope we will come out with the right decision here, and I look forward to the results,” he said. 
The bill requires that all legislative rules enacted by the state board must first be authorized by the Legislative Oversight Commission on Education Accountability, a lawmaker committee known as LOCEA. The proposed rules would then be submitted to the full Legislature for review.
“I think the point of the bill is to work with the Department of Education,” Hornby said. “A lot of people keep saying we want control — it’s not the intent.”
In 2022, West Virginia voters rejected a constitutional amendment that would have given the Legislature authority to review and approve the state board of education’s rules and policies. 
Fifty-eight percent of voters were against it.
Opponents of this year’s legislation consistently argued that it was ignoring West Virginians’ decision on the matter and injecting politics into classrooms. 
Hornby also said he sponsored the bill because he wanted the West Virginia Supreme Court to revisit the issue. 
The state school board has independent authority to oversee schools. The state Supreme Court upheld this in 1988 in West Virginia Board of Education vs. Hechler, determining that the state Board of Education has the “general supervision” of schools under the Constitution. Any statutory provision that interferes with authority and rule-making is unconstitutional, the opinion read. 
“A lot of people think that decision was wrong,” Hornby said. “That’s why I figured we’d do this, and that’s why we got a lot of sponsors.” 
Ten other House Republicans sponsored the measure, including House Education Committee Chairman Joe Ellington, R-Mercer.
During bill debate, Democratic lawmakers predicted that the bill would likely result in a lawsuit. They argued — like the state school board — that the measure wasn’t constitutional since the state Supreme Court had already ruled on the matter and the proposed amendment was defeated by voters three years ago. 
Hornby said money spent on the case would be “well spent” if it fixes the education system.

“This is no ordinary criminal case, and Dugan is no ordinary criminal defendant,” the motion states. “Dugan is a Milwaukee County Circuit Court judge. She was arrested and indicted for actions allegedly taken in and in the immediate vicinity of her courtroom, involving a person appearing before her as a party. The government’s prosecution of Judge Dugan is virtually unprecedented and entirely unconstitutional — it violates the Tenth Amendment and fundamental principles of federalism and comity reflected in that amendment and in the very structure of the United States Constitution.” 
The motion states that the problems with the prosecution “are legion,” and begin with her judicial immunity, which prevents judges from being charged with crimes for their official acts. Immunity is not a defense to be used at trial but “is an absolute bar to the prosecution at the outset,” the motion states, citing the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Trump v. United States that found the president can’t be charged with crimes for official acts. 
Dugan has been accused by federal officials of helping an immigrant without legal status in the U.S. escape from federal agents waiting to arrest him outside her courtroom last month. The criminal complaint alleges she directed the man, Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, who came to her court for a routine hearing in a misdemeanor case, out a side door to avoid federal agents waiting to arrest him with an administrative warrant. Flores-Ruiz and his lawyer exited the courtroom into the same hallway where the agents were waiting and a DEA agent rode down the elevator with him before he was arrested on the street. 
Trump administration officials have touted the case as an example of a stern federal response to “deranged” judges across the country working to stymie the president’s efforts to increase immigration enforcement. 
Dugan’s motion states the facts alleged in the indictment and criminal complaint against her would be disproven at trial, but that the case should never get that far. 
“Even if (contrary to what the trial evidence would show) Judge Dugan took the actions the complaint alleges, these plainly were judicial acts for which she has absolute immunity from criminal prosecution,” the motion states. “Judges are empowered to maintain control over their courtrooms specifically and the courthouse generally.” 
Dugan’s attorneys also argue that the prosecution violates the Tenth Amendment, which clarifies the balance of power between states and the federal government. The motion states that federal agents going into a state courthouse to arrest a sitting judge is a violation of the Constitution. 
“The government’s prosecution here reaches directly into a state courthouse, disrupting active proceedings, and interferes with the official duties of an elected judge,” the motion states. “The federal government violated Wisconsin’s sovereignty on April 18 when it disrupted Judge Dugan’s courtroom, and it is violating Wisconsin’s sovereignty now with this prosecution. The Court should end the violation of Wisconsin’s sovereignty and dismiss the indictment.” 
Dugan is scheduled to appear in court for her arraignment Thursday morning.

,California,2025-05-14 21:30:14+00:00,CalMatters,Newsom picks more housing over CEQA in backing two bills meant to speed construction,Ben Christopher,,,,,https://calmatters.org/housing/2025/05/newsom-ceqa-yimby-housing/,The California environmental law known as CEQA can be used to block construction in developed areas. Gov. Gavin Newsom is supporting changes to encourage more housing.,"In summary
The California environmental law known as CEQA can be used to block construction in developed areas. Gov. Gavin Newsom is supporting changes to encourage more housing.


The effort by two Bay Area lawmakers to exempt most urban housing developments from the state’s premier environmental regulation — an idea that has drawn some of the state’s most powerful interest groups into a fierce legislative debate — just received a prized endorsement from Gov. Gavin Newsom.
While announcing his updated budget proposal for the coming fiscal year, the governor urged the Legislature to pass two housing bills and thanked their Democratic authors, Oakland Assemblymember Buffy Wicks and San Francisco Sen. Scott Wiener.
“It’s time to get serious about this issue, period, full stop,” Newsom said this morning. “If you care about your kids you care about getting this done. This is the biggest opportunity to do something big and bold and the only impediment is us.”
Wicks’ Assembly Bill 609 would exempt most “infill” housing developments,  projects built in or next to existing developments, from review under the California Environmental Quality Act. That 55-year-old statute requires governments to study the environmental impact of any decisions they make, including the approval of new housing. Any person or organization — construction worker unions, environmental advocates or neighborhood groups, to name a few —can challenge the validity of those studies, delaying approval. 
Critics of the law argue that it is regularly abused for non-environmental reasons to delay urban housing projects which are inherently better for the environment than sprawl development. Defenders of the law say such lawsuits are relatively rare.
Wiener’s Senate Bill 607 is a highly technical grab bag. Among other things it would make it easier for state and local governments to approve projects — housing and otherwise — without conducting a full, lengthy review and exempt certain zoning changes for infill projects from CEQA entirely.
Newsom said that he would include language that mirrors those policy goals in upcoming budget bills. 
“These bills are critical permitting reform proposals, and I applaud Gov. Newsom for including them in his proposed budget,” Wiener said in a statement. “By clearing away outdated procedural hurdles, we can address California’s outrageous cost of living, grow California’s economy, and help the government solve the most pressing problems facing our state.”
The governor also published proposed legislative language that would channel certain environmental impact fees collected from development projects toward the construction of new affordable housing located near public transit stops. That mirrors another bill authored by Wicks.
That proposed legislation would also give the California Coastal Commission, a frequent target of pro-development legislation, a deadline for responding to project proposals.
This isn’t the first time the governor has weighed in on the landmark environmental law. Two times in as many years, the administration has urged the Legislature to tinker with the law to make it easier to build infrastructure projects and to expand the state’s renewable energy capacity.

The Legislature hasn’t always listened and the prospect of comprehensive “CEQA reform,” a goal regularly touted by California governors and resisted by environmental groups and many unions, remains elusive. 
Those earlier legislative efforts were “weak sauce” and “piddlywinks,” these bills represent much more substantive change to housing and environmental policy, said Chris Elmendorf, a UC Davis Law professor and frequent public critic of CEQA.
“The fact that the governor is willing not just speak in generalities, not just have Ezra Klein on his podcast, but to endorse specific bills and even go beyond endorsing them by tying them to his budget and putting pressure on the Legislature, that, I think is a very big development that we haven’t seen previously from this governor,” he said.
His nod to these two bills comes at a politically important time. Wicks’ bill has sailed through the Assembly so far with the explicit backing of Speaker Robert Rivas. Wiener’s bill has made its way through one committee, but only barely and over the objections of that committee’s chair.Both Legislative leaders have vowed to prioritize legislation that promotes “affordability.” Rivas, closely allied with the “yes in my backyard” movement, has publicly endorsed a suite of bills aimed at reducing regulations and speeding up approvals for new housing. McGuire, tasked with wrangling a Senate Democratic caucus with public fractures over housing policy, has been more reluctant to articulate the specifics of his housing agenda.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/080723_Oakland-Affordable-Housing_SN_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-14 18:08:50.666591

The General Services Administration put the site on the market after July 2023 flooding caused significant damage.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  The former Montpelier post office building is up for sale. Should the city buy it?.","The federal building in Montpelier on Jan. 8, 2024. File photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerFor roughly 22 months, the former site of the Montpelier Post Office has sat vacant, a lonely looming presence at the corner of State and Elm streets. The building sustained significant damage from the July 2023 flood, when water inundated the streets of Vermont’s capital. It was so hastily vacated that federal employees’ items are still sitting on their desks, creating an “eerie” feeling, according to Jon Copans, executive director of the Montpelier Commission for Recovery and Resilience. Now, the city and state are considering whether it may be worth buying the property at 87 State St. from its owner, the U.S. General Services Administration. “If you think about the location of this particular building and piece of land, it really does represent a transformative opportunity for our city in terms of what comes next,” Copans said. The commission, a private/public partnership between Montpelier Foundation, Montpelier Alive and the city itself that was developed in the wake of the July 2023 flood, has been working to lead a discussion about the potential uses of the property — including housing, parking, businesses, state offices and more. The General Services Administration announced it would begin the disposition process in December 2024. On April 21, it sent a letter to Montpelier and the state of Vermont about the possibility of a negotiated sale, similar to a “right of first refusal” for government actors before it becomes available to the general public, Copans said. READ MORE
Since then, the commission has been coordinating a collaborative discussion between Montpelier, the General Services Administration and the Vermont Agency of Commerce and Community Development to determine whether this property could be a good fit for Montpelier’s needs. Many questions remain. Copans wouldn’t even put a ballpark estimate on the sale price of the property since there hasn’t been an appraisal on it post-flooding. In the 2024 Grand List, it was valued at $7.8 million.Asked about the current condition of the building, Paul Hughes, a spokesperson for the General Services Administration, said via email that it has been “stabilized.” He wrote that the General Services Administration decided to dispose of the property “after it was deemed a high financial and operational risk.” Montpelier’s post office has since moved into the Montpelier City Center at the corner of State and Main streets. Copans said there was a “gargantuan” amount of water in the basement of the former post office, but “my understanding is they have done a lot of work.” Local rumors have circulated about problems with the building’s foundation, but Copans said the General Services Administration has reassured the commission that it’s still solid.It’s also unclear if the building may come with a historic covenant to preserve its appearance since it’s a part of Montpelier’s historic downtown. Copans said many people find its Brutalist style not “particularly pleasing,” but nonetheless, its historic status is one issue that would need to be addressed in order for Montpelier to get a sense of the value of the building.The 70,000-square-foot building, built in 1964, hosted the post office’s retail space on the first floor with room for postal activity in the back. The second and third floors had office space for federal agencies like the U.S. Department of Agriculture and U.S. senators’ local headquarters. When it comes to how the city could make use of the building, Copans said housing was at the forefront of everyone’s mind. Montpelier has faced a housing shortage that only worsened after the 2023 flood. The property also comes with a large parking lot that could be developed into multilevel parking, Copans said. That could ease the need for parking on the other side of State Street, where riverside parking lots are exacerbating flood risk.“We don’t believe that’s the highest and best use for that riverfront property,” he said. “A, it is ugly and B, it’s really not great when it comes to flood resilience to have a bunch of impervious surface right next to the river.”Lindsay Kurrle, secretary of the Agency of Commerce and Community Development, said the state has a “shared interest” in building resilient communities and developing housing for workers across the state. “This has presented an opportunity for everyone to kind of lean in and take a look at this building and see how it could be redeveloped,” Kurrle said. The state has no obligation to actually take ownership, Kurrle said — but it’s facilitating the opportunity to do an assessment of the sale. There’s no risk involved at this point, she said, since the parties are just expressing interest. The Montpelier city manager’s office, the city spokesperson and the mayor did not respond to interview requests. Read the story on VTDigger here:  The former Montpelier post office building is up for sale.

Jay Collins speaking in Tampa on May 12, 2025. (Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Hillsborough County Republican state Sen. Jay Collins is one of Ron DeSantis’ top allies in the Legislature’s upper chamber, so might the governor consider naming him as the state’s next lieutenant governor?
DeSantis hasn’t tipped his hand in any direction to date in terms of who he is considering to fill not only the LG position that has been vacant since Jeanette Nuñez departed to lead Florida International University in February, but also the chief financial officer seat that has remained empty since Jimmy Patronis resigned shortly before he was elected to serve as the U.S. representative in Florida’s 6th Congressional District last month.
POLITICO reported in late April that DeSantis is likely to select Hernando County Republican Sen. Blaise Ingoglia to succeed Patronis as CFO, although the timing remains uncertain with the Legislature now extending its regular session to contend with the serious disagreement between the two chambers about the state budget.
There hasn’t been much speculation about the lieutenant governor’s position, but Collins, like Ingoglia, is considered one of the governor’s closest supporters in the Senate.
“We haven’t had a direct conversation on that,” Collins told the Phoenix on Wednesday. “If my name’s in the running, that’s an incredible honor.”
Collins said that if the governor wants him in that role, “I’m sure we’ll have the appropriate conversation when the time comes. I think we’ve heard him say he’s really hyper focused right now on this budget, which is critical.”
He equally is focused on the House and Senate coming together to resolve their differences, Collins said.
“I’m really focused on getting the job done, but if that conversation happens, we’ll have it. It’s an honor to serve our state and I’d be happy to do it,” he said.
‘Perform such duties’
Per Article IV, Section 2 of the Florida Constitution, the lieutenant governor “shall perform such duties pertaining to the office of governor as shall be assigned by the governor.” Other parts of the state Constitution say that, upon impeachment “or during the governor’s physical or mental incapacity, the lieutenant governor shall act as governor.”
No other specific duties are assigned to the lieutenant governor, but most have been given specific assignments during their tenure. Nuñez was appointed by DeSantis as chair of the Florida Women’s Suffrage Centennial Commission at the beginning of their first term together in 2019, and in 2019 and again in 2023 to chair the Space Florida Board of Directors.
Collins has served in the Florida Senate since 2022. A decorated Army Special Forces veteran and Purple Heart recipient who served more than two decades in the U.S. Army, he initially decided to run for Congress against Democrat Kathy Castor in 2021. After redistricting occurred in early 2022, he then filed to run in Florida’s 15th Congressional District.
However, he was recruited by Florida Republicans to challenge Democratic incumbent Janet Cruz in the Florida Senate District 14 seat in Hillsborough County in the fall of 2022, with the full backing of DeSantis. He ended up winning the seat by 10 points.
DeSantis said in Tampa on Monday that he was intent on appointing replacements for lieutenant governor and chief financial officer once the regular legislative session ends — which, of course, hasn’t happened yet.
“Now, it doesn’t mean at this juncture that I couldn’t do anything before a budget gets laid on the desk, but I also just am mindful that there’s still work to be done, and I just want to make sure that we kind of see that process through. But we will do it, and that will happen, you know, relatively soon,” the governor said.

,California,2025-05-14 21:23:36+00:00,CalMatters,Newsom blames California’s worsening state budget outlook on Trump’s tariffs,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/05/california-budget-may-revise-trump/,"Gavin Newsom pinned California's gloomy financial picture on a ""Trump slump,"" blaming the president's tariffs during the rollout of a revised state budget proposal.","As Gov. Gavin Newsom unveiled a revised 2025-26 budget Wednesday, he blamed a “Trump slump” from President Donald Trump’s tariffs and other economic moves as the major factor in increasing the state’s deficit by another $12 billion.
“California is under assault,” Newsom told reporters at a budget briefing, declaring that Trump’s actions had created “a climate of deep uncertainty.”
The initial budget Newsom proposed in January already had at least an $11 billion gap between income and outgo that he filled with reserves, loans, deferrals, raids on special funds and accounting maneuvers.
State tax receipts were running ahead of expectations during the early part of the year, but after Trump imposed tariffs on imported goods, saying it would spur domestic production, Newsom and his budget staff revised revenue estimates downward, particularly personal income taxes.
“Washington’s imposition of tariffs has driven a downgrade in both the economic and revenue forecasts,” the revised budget declares. “Combined with increased expenditure growth above the governor’s (January) budget — most notably in Medi-Cal — the state must now close an estimated shortfall of $12 billion to balance the budget and provide for a prudent discretionary reserve. This will require difficult but necessary decisions to reduce ongoing expenditure growth to maintain budget resilience and stability for critical state programs.”
The revised budget maintains overall spending at virtually the same level of the January version, $322 billion, but drops general fund expenditures by $2 billion to $226 billion.
As noted, the state also experienced a multibillion-dollar spike in costs for Medi-Cal, the state’s health care system for the poor, which contributed to the $12 billion deficit estimate. Newsom proposed a series of maneuvers to close the new deficit, primarily reductions in Medi-Cal, including a freeze on adult enrollments and $100 per month premiums for Medi-Cal enrollees.
By singling out Medi-Cal as a major driver of state spending and urging reductions, Newsom was doing a 180-degree political pirouette from a year ago, when he was boasting about achieving nearly 100% medical care coverage for Californians with the addition of thousands of undocumented immigrants to the programs rolls.
The latest expansion of California’s chronic budget gap, what fiscal experts deem a “structural deficit,” makes it virtually certain that Newsom’s governorship will end 19 months hence with the state’s finances still unbalanced. The governor’s own budget staff and the Legislature’s nonpartisan budget advisor, Gabe Petek, have both projected multibillion-dollar deficits well into the future. It doesn’t appear that a sudden economic boom will provide fiscal salvation.
The revised budget projects that California’s economy faces a sluggish future, with little overall job growth and unemployment rates, which are now among the nation’s highest, virtually unchanged. Accordingly, state revenues are projected to increase slowly.
The forecasts don’t assume that the national economy will drift into recession, as some economists are predicting due to Trump’s tariffs. If one occurred, it would depress revenues even more.
The budget also does not assess the potential reductions in federal aid to states, particularly in health care, that Trump and Republicans in Congress have proposed. Medi-Cal and other social and medical programs are targets in both Washington and Sacramento because they are among the largest items in both federal and state budgets.
As services are trimmed to close budget gaps, advocates for the poor, public employee labor unions and progressive groups are increasing pressure for tax increases to balance the state’s books.
Newsom has resisted those calls, but if the projected multi-year deficits become reality, the tax increase drumbeat will grow louder. He can and probably will continue to shun tax increases but if he does, the pressure will hit his successor, whomever that is, immediately upon inauguration.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/051425_Newsom-May-Budget_FG_CM_08.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-14 18:08:50.666591

”These devices were essentially slot machines dressed up as skill games,” Attorney General Dave Sunday said in a statement. “I commend our partners at the Pennsylvania State Police for helping disband a large-scale operation that netted a tremendous amount of illegal gambling profits.”
A search of the companies’ warehouse in Homestead, Allegheny County, uncovered $175,000 in cash and other signs of illegal gambling. The facility also had an elaborate surveillance system with dozens of monitors streaming live video and audio from the gambling locations, court documents say.
According to the charging documents, skill games are distinguishable from video gambling devices because they require players to use their judgment to win. The machines seized are similar to video slot machines, except that if only two symbols match, the machine prompts the player to “nudge” the third into place to recover their initial bet plus a small prize, the court documents say. 
While a spokesman for the attorney general’s office said it is pursuing charges only against Conley’s companies, court records show Conley was charged last year with illegal gambling offenses by the Cumberland County district attorney’s office. An attorney for Conley identified in a court filing did not immediately return a call Wednesday.
Federal court records show Conley was convicted of gambling and money laundering in 1995.
Conley and his son, John D. Conley, are also named in court documents as the leaders of an illegal gambling enterprise that paid nearly $100,000 in kickbacks to Ricky Goodling, a former state police corporal, who worked as national compliance director for Georgia-based Pace-O-Matic until 2023. A spokesperson for Pace-O-Matic said the company fired Goodling when it learned of the investigation.
Goodling is charged with racketeering and related offenses that stem from a years-long state police investigation. Also charged in the case are three employees of Deibler Brothers Novelty Co., a Schuylkill County company that prosecutors say distributed illegal gambling machines in 15 central and eastern Pennsylvania counties.
The attorney general’s office alleges Goodling took more than $500,000 in kickbacks from the Conley organization, Diebler Brothers and other operators to quash complaints about illegal slot machines. Prosecutors also allege Goodling helped distributors of the illegal devices obtain Pace-O-Matic’s machines to attempt to disguise illegal machines and deflect law enforcement scrutiny.
A preliminary hearing for Goodling in Schuylkill County is scheduled for May 22.
Pace-O-Matic is the predominant operator of skill games in Pennsylvania. 
A series of court decisions has established that skill games are distinct from gambling machines and not covered by the state Gaming Act. But Pace-O-Matic has been a proponent of legislation to regulate and tax the games to confirm their legal status. 
Gov. Josh Shapiro said regulating skill games is one of his goals in this year’s budget. His spending planestimates taxing the devices would generate around $370 million, recouping money the state lottery and casinos have lost.

Ivey Wednesday signed a bill sponsored by Rep. Andy Whitt, R-Harvest that would regulate the sale of hemp products in Alabama. (Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)Gov. Kay Ivey Wednesday signed a controversial bill aimed at regulating consumable hemp products into law.
HB 445, sponsored by Rep. Andy Whitt, R-Harvest, faced strong opposition from the hemp industry, which claims the bill overregulates federally legal products, and the Alabama Policy Institute, a conservative think tank, which argued it did not regulate the products enough. 
Gina Maiola, a spokeswoman for Ivey, confirmed that the governor had signed the bill in a text message on Wednesday, but did not provide further comment.
Whitt said after the governor’s signature that it was “an easy bill” for him to sponsor but “a hard bill to pass.”
“It was hard because I took shots from both sides,” he said, saying that it was difficult to listen to the “stretches of truth,” such as claims from API that it would legalize recreational marijuana or from the industry that it’s a “complete ban.”
“It is putting guardrails on an unregulated and unlicensed product in the state of Alabama that’s preying on our youth,” Whitt said.

Messages seeking comment were left with API and Molly Cole, a lobbyist for the Alabama Hemp and Vape Association, who indicated that litigation was being considered.
The legislation will require testing and labeling for all consumable hemp products and caps at 10 milligrams per individually wrapped product and 40 milligrams per package. It will require the Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) Board to license retailers of these products, restrict retail establishments selling hemp products and impose an excise tax on consumable hemp products.
The bill also prohibits sales to minors. It bans smokable hemp products and imposes restrictions on online sales and direct delivery. 
Whitt maintained that his efforts is aimed at reducing youth access to these products, saying that the industry has operated largely unchecked.

Representatives of the hemp industry said the bill’s language was vague and have suggested that litigation will follow. 
Lawmakers, business owners, patients and lobbyists have also expressed uncertainty about the legislation. Whitt said that the bill also bans hemp-derived vapor products, but that is not clearly defined in the bill.  
It’s not clear if the bill would ban CBD, a non-psychoactive cannabinoid found in hemp. The bill explicitly bans smokable hemp products and certain psychoactive cannabinoids but defines “consumable hemp product” broadly as any finished product intended for human or animal consumption that contains any part of the hemp plant or its derivatives.
According to the bill, “any smokeable hemp product” not limited to “plant product or raw hemp material that is marketed to consumers as hemp cigarettes, hemp cigars, hemp joints, hemp buds, hemp flowers, hemp leaves, ground hemp flowers, or any variation of these terms to include any product that contains a cannabinoid, whether psychoactive or not.”
Whitt said that the legislation provides an opportunity for hemp business leaders to “pivot into the products that that are approved here in Alabama that can truly help Alabama citizens again.”

The report published by the Utah Foundation — a nonprofit with the mission of informing Utahns with nonpartisan public policy research — didn’t find glaring differences that would suggest Republican or Democratic delegates are completely out of touch with the rest of their voting party members. 
Axson or Lyman? Utah Republican delegates to elect their next leader

But it did find some notable differences, especially when it comes to demographics like age, sex and education, and issues that are top of mind when compared to the voters that delegates represent in the caucus and convention system. 
The Utah Foundation report, informed by three separate surveys conducted by Y2 Analytics in 2024, outlined these key findings: 

Pessimism: Delegates from both parties are more pessimistic than their voter counterparts. The difference was more apparent among Republicans, with 55% of GOP delegates saying they felt the state was on the wrong track compared to only 42% of voters. Among Democratic delegates, 84% said they felt the state was on the wrong track, compared to 79% of Democratic voters. 
Ideological differences: Republican delegates are “somewhat more conservative” than GOP voters, the report said, “while Democratic delegates are about the same as Democratic voters.” While measuring “ideological consistency” based on answers to survey questions, pollsters found the median Republican voter is “less conservative” than the median Republican delegate, while the median Democratic voter and delegate are about the same. “In other words, Utah’s Republican delegates are more likely to have consistently conservative views than Republican voters, while Democratic delegates are about the same as Democratic voters,” the report said. 
Issue priorities: GOP delegates “place less importance on housing, roads, air quality, and crime when compared to Republican voters,” the report said, “while Democratic delegates focus more on education content and less on healthcare and homelessness when compared to Democratic voters.” 
Demographics: Most notably, delegates of both parties are more likely to fit specific democratic characteristics. “Both Republican and Democratic delegates are more likely than voters to be men, actively religious, older, and white, and have more education and higher incomes,” the report said. 

Is the Utah convention system still relevant?

“I think the key takeaway is there are quite a few differences between voters and delegates,” said Utah Foundation President Shawn Teigen during a call with media discussing the outcomes of the report on Wednesday. “But I think the most notable is in terms of demographics. (Delegates tend to be) actively religious and men, but also tend to be older, white, and have more education and higher incomes.” 
When it comes to priorities, the survey also found some but not many differences between delegates and voters in both parties. 
When asked to rank 17 priorities, Republican delegates tended to rank the Great Salt Lake and women’s rights as more important when compared to GOP voters. However, Republican delegates also ranked housing, roads, density and crime as slightly less important, while air quality ranked less important. 
Democratic delegates, when compared to Democratic voters, ranked government overreach and crime as less important. 
In conclusion, the report said that even though delegates tend to be more pessimistic than their voter counterparts, in general “their ideological positions show notable alignment with voters.” 
“While voters and delegates have similar ideologies, the priorities look a little different for Republicans than they do for Democrats,” the report said. “The largest differences in priorities among the parties’ voters and delegates are air quality for Republicans and crime for Democrats, each of which was less important for delegates.”

,DC,2025-05-14 21:09:40+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"U.S. House panel passes GOP plan that cuts Medicaid by $625B, adds work requirement",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-panel-passes-gop-plan-cuts-medicaid-625b-adds-work-requirement,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. House panel in charge of overhauling Medicaid by cutting hundreds of billions in federal spending wrapped up debate on its bill Wednesday, following a 25-hour session.The Energy and Commerce Committee voted 30-24 along party lines to sign off on the legislation, sending it to the Budget panel, which is expected to bundle it together with the other 10 measures Friday to create Republicans’ “big, beautiful bill.”The full House is set to vote on that package next week, though GOP leaders need to make sure nearly all of the chamber’s 220 Republicans support the overall bill in order for it to pass.The legislation, should it gain that backing, will then head to the Senate, where GOP lawmakers are expected to rewrite or eliminate numerous sections of the bill. Analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, shared with States Newsroom by Republican staff on the Energy and Commerce Committee, shows the Medicaid changes would cut $625 billion in federal spending during the next decade.About 10.3 million people would lose access to Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with 7.6 million people becoming uninsured during the 10-year budget window, according to the CBO analysis, which has yet to be released publicly.House committee debate on the bill, which began Tuesday and continued overnight, largely centered around Democrats saying the legislation would lead millions of vulnerable people to lose access to Medicaid, while Republicans contended their overhaul would protect “the integrity” of the health care program for lower income Americans and some people with disabilities.Democrats proposed dozens of amendments trying to change the bill’s various sections, including the Medicaid provisions, but Republicans on the committee blocked their adoption.‘They’re going to lose coverage’Just after the sun rose over Capitol Hill on Wednesday morning, Ohio Democratic Rep. Greg Landsman said Republican claims about people not being kicked off Medicaid due to federal spending cuts were going “off the rails.”“They're going to lose coverage in part because of the red tape and the paperwork. We know that because we've seen it in other states,” Landsman said. “And these are people who are eligible or deserving — people who need it.”Washington Democratic Sen. Kim Schrier later in the day raised concerns that people who lose access to Medicaid would put off getting routine care from primary care doctors, only to end up in emergency departments.""Those kicked off Medicaid will still get care, of course, but they will be sicker, they'll be treated in the emergency room, the care will be more complicated, more expensive,” Schrier said. “And since they can't pay for it, all of us will make up that difference. So our insurance rates will go up.""Florida Rep. Laurel Lee argued the GOP changes to Medicaid are common sense improvements, like “restoring work requirements for able-bodied adults without dependents, modernizing systems to prevent fraud and abuse, and ending misdirected payments to those who are deceased or who are not eligible for the program.”“These reforms are not about taking something away; they are about protecting the integrity of the program so that the people we represent — those who truly need this support — can count on it to be there, now and in the future,” Lee said. “Our reforms are about restoring integrity to the system and ensuring that it works for the long haul.”Attempts to ax work requirementDemocrats proposed numerous amendments during debate on the health care section of the bill, including some that would have eliminated the work requirements.New Jersey Democratic Rep. Frank Pallone, ranking member on the committee, said those requirements often cause people to lose access to Medicaid due to “red tape” and paperwork.Pallone said when Georgia implemented work requirements, fewer than 7,000 of the 400,000 people eligible for Medicaid were able to prove to the government they met the standards.“It's not that they weren't eligible, it's that the state of Georgia put too many barriers in the way of them being able to qualify,” Pallone said. “And that's what I think is happening here today with this bill.”He further criticized the GOP for including a provision in the bill saying that if people are not eligible for Medicaid then “they're not eligible for any kind of subsidy under the Affordable Care Act.”“So they don't have that option as well, which is, of course, also the basis for the CBO saying so many people get kicked off Medicaid,” Pallone said. “They assumed that if you didn't have Medicaid, you would go to the ACA, and that would have probably eliminated most of your savings. But instead, now you say they can't go to the ACA because they still haven't filled out the paperwork for Medicaid, so we're not going to let them go to the ACA and get any kind of subsidized care. And it goes on and on.”‘We don’t want to repeat the Arkansas law’Energy and Commerce Chairman Brett Guthrie, R-Ky., said the GOP proposals for work requirements sought to avoid the issues experienced in Arkansas and Georgia, when those states implemented their work requirements for Medicaid.“We don't want to repeat the Arkansas law,” Guthrie said. “We agree that was the wrong way to do it.”Arkansas’ experiment with work requirements and monthly checks was “overly cumbersome,” but Guthrie said this legislation would “only require a beneficiary to have to verify work at the time of enrollment or during a redetermined position of their eligibility. This allows states and beneficiaries to take advantage of existing processing and paperwork that they already go through.”The GOP bill includes several exceptions to the requirement that people enrolled in Medicaid between the ages of 19 and 65 work, participate in community service, or attend an educational program at least 80 hours a month.Those exclusions include pregnant people, parents of dependent children, people who have complex medical conditions, tribal community members, people in the foster system, people who were in the foster system who are below the age of 26 and people released from incarceration in the last 90 days, among others.CBO estimates the work requirements would save the federal government $300 billion during the next decade. That savings wouldn’t begin until after the provision takes effect on Jan. 1, 2029.GOP lawmakers not on the committee have expressed frustration with the delayed implementation, including South Carolina Republican Rep. Ralph Norman.“Delaying work requirements for able-bodied adults on Medicaid to 2029 isn't ‘progress,’” Norman wrote in a social media post. “It's fiscally irresponsible and another sad excuse for the swamp!!”Texas Republican Rep. Chip Roy, wrote in a four-page letter, that Congress must “significantly amend” several of the bill’s Medicaid provisions, including immediately implementing the work requirements.“Republicans are in control now and should not let out-of-year savings be compromised by a future Democratic trifecta,” Roy wrote.Planned Parenthood debateTexas Democratic Rep. Lizzie Fletcher sought to remove the provision that would block Medicaid funding from going to Planned Parenthood, though GOP lawmakers ultimately voted to keep the language in the measure. Federal law for decades has prevented taxpayer dollars from going to abortion services with exceptions for rape, incest, or the life of the pregnant patient. But the provision in the GOP bill would block all Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood, including for preventive care and regular health check-ups.Medicaid enrollees who go to Planned Parenthood for wellness checks, birth control, lab work, cancer screenings and other services would have to find a different provider, or go without care.“To make up the gap, federally qualified health centers would need to increase their capacity by an additional 1 million clients,” Fletcher said. “This is just another way people will lose access to health care. Defunding Planned Parenthood is an assault on the health, dignity and freedom of women across this country.”Fletcher later pointed out that Planned Parenthood clinics and their affiliates in states with abortion bans would be cut off from federal funding, even though they don’t provide abortions.She listed the Houston, Texas, Planned Parenthood as one example of a facility that doesn’t perform abortions but would lose federal funding.The Planned Parenthood language would increase federal deficits by about $300 million during the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office. It is the only provision in the health care section of the bill that would not reduce federal spending.Other organizations said to be affectedVirginia Republican Rep. Morgan Griffith said he was told by CBO that other health organizations in addition to Planned Parenthood would be impacted by the provision, but he was unable to name those health care organizations.The provision would apply to “providers that are nonprofit organizations, that are essential community providers that are primarily engaged in family planning services or reproductive services, provide for abortions other than for Hyde Amendment exceptions, and which received $1,000,000 or more (to either the provider or the provider’s affiliates) in payments from Medicaid payments in 2024,” according to a summary of the GOP bill. It would take effect as soon as the bill becomes law and last for a decade.Republican staff on the Energy and Commerce Committee did not immediately respond to a request from States Newsroom for the list that Griffith referenced.Legal staff said the secretary of Health and Human Services would determine what organizations meet that definition and would therefore lose federal Medicaid funding.Tennessee Republican Rep. Diana Harshbarger opposed the amendment, saying that it was well past time for Congress to cut off all federal funding for Planned Parenthood.“This bill does not change the availability of funds for women's health. It simply establishes a safeguard so that the nation's largest abortion providers are not the one providing services through Medicaid,” Harshbarger said. “Should these entities stop participating in abortion services, they would again be eligible to receive funding.”Republicans also blocked an amendment from Illinois Democratic Rep. Robin Kelly that would have required Medicaid to cover a full year of postpartum coverage for enrollees.The vast majority of states already cover postpartum care for a year under an expansion Democrats approved in the American Rescue Plan, the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill they enacted in 2021. That was later made permanent in a 2022 appropriations law.  But Kelly said she was worried that would change if states had to make tough budget choices due to a drop-off in federal funding for the program.“Medicaid covers almost half of all births in this country and covers more than half of all births in rural communities,” Kelly said. “When we talk about cutting funding, you are cutting into the care that supports moms and babies during the most vulnerable time of their lives.”Harshbarger spoke against the amendment, saying it was unnecessary.",,,,2025-05-14 18:08:50.666591

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)In the 21st century our newly visible wealthy elite aristocracy, together with a few super-wealthy oligarchs leading the way, have essentially “come out” as a political class openly working to subvert American democratic values/processes and install themselves as America’s untouchable ruling class. The 2010 “Citizens United” court decision allows them to use their unlimited resources to purchase politicians willing to bend the knee to their every legislative wish, essentially turning the Congress into homeless beggars shining shoes and licking boots for a living.
American democratic culture has always understood that unregulated accumulation of capital makes for anti-democratic corruption of wealth holders. Not long ago, we imposed luxury taxes on everything from yachts to mansions to cars to airplanes to keep people from believing that they were special above all others. However, we no longer seem to care about the corrosive effects of huge piles of money because we repealed many of those taxes.
In Utah the wealthy class aligns with evangelical religious interests, which encompass certain Protestant, Catholic, and Latter-day Saint sub-groupings, as is the case nationwide. The idea is that the considerable private resources of the “kingdom of God,” together with regular encouragement to individual and familial self-sufficiency provided by church education systems, allows the public sector to clip its own wings by cutting back on state and local taxes.
The Utah legislature has cut the state income tax five times in recent years under the guise of promoting upward mobility for all Utahns. Their efforts constitute a reduction of the overall resources available for public uses in Utah without providing for regularized replacement sources of income.
In Utah, the Republican-controlled legislature recently attempted to allow a constitutionally mandated “earmark” of income tax funds for public schools, higher education, children and disabled people to be freed up for other purposes when needed. One might argue this amounts to a shift away from the priority that Utah’s ancestors established by instituting the “education earmark” in 1948 in the first place. After successfully concluding World War II, soldiers came home fully recognizing that they had fought for a more democratic world. They wanted to see progress in education for all of Utah’s citizens, not just the wealthy portion of the citizenry or a religiously partisan portion of it.
At a time when the national MAGA party is decimating long-standing federal education commitments, traditional Republican party theory says state governments are obligated to pick up the slack by means of federal block grants or at very least maintain local commitments. However, Utah is trying to deep-six the most important of those local commitments, further strangulating resources devoted to marginalized populations.
In October 2024, the court ruled that the legislature had failed to meet the informed notice requirements of a proper constitutional amendment, so the measure was voided for this year by the court.
The Sutherland Institute, Utah’s conservative think tank, ably summarizes the evangelical notion of private sector sufficiency by touting “the Utah Miracle.” This miracle is Utah’s heavy and purportedly successful dependence upon “economic growth, high religious attendance, and unmatched rates of married families.” However, this tripartite private focus is clearly not broad enough to “lift all boats,” or to provide for “trickle-down” resources from the rich to the poor, as evidenced by Utah’s exploding unhoused population.
Nationwide, unregulated capital has trashed the U.S. Constitution at every turn, including working to unhinge America from its progressive income tax structure and also rely on regressive sales and fuel taxes; end business competition by means of industry-wide monopolies in restraint of trade; diminish corporate taxation; lower tax rates on capital gains; prohibit government bargaining on drug prices; discriminate against lower-income renters by way of the home mortgage interest deduction provision of the tax code; double the exemption for estate taxes for the rich; push debt spending through misleading advertising so as to keep the middle class and the working poor in a perpetual state of debt servitude; engage in stock buybacks to line their own pockets.
For 3,000 years the Judeo-Christian culture in Europe and America kept interest rates charged on borrowers in the single-digit range, but now the American aristocracy has succeeded in charging 20% and more on credit card rates for the middle class, and anywhere from 100-300% on annualized short-term payday-type loans to the working poor. Utah recently had the second highest short-term consumer loan rates in the nation.
Since World War II the wealthy have also promoted the long-term decline of unions capable of collective bargaining. Utah wants to add to this negative trend by prohibiting public unions from collective bargaining. Utah voters are currently working on an initiative to reverse this legislative policy.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/020625_Utah-State-Capitol_50-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-14 18:08:50.666591

(Photo by Kathie Obradovich/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Lawmakers could wrap up the 2025 session as early as Wednesday – but there are still several spending and final policy measures left on the chambers’ calendars before legislators can head home.
Before ending the session, lawmakers must approve the state’s budget, the collection of bills funding Iowa’s state departments, agencies as well as meeting other spending obligations. Several of the appropriations bills for fiscal year 2026 passed Monday and Tuesday, some moving between chambers and others going to Gov. Kim Reynolds.
The spending bills sent to the governor reflect the budget agreement reached between the Senate and House Republican majorities earlier in May. Some of the budget items House Republicans had requested – like $14 million for paraeducator pay and $8 million for the public safety equipment fund – have been provided through a one-time allocation from the Sports Wagering Fund, which currently contains $40 million.
The Senate Appropriations Committee approved Senate Study Bill 1240 Wednesday, the bill making this appropriation, as well as Senate Study Bill 1241, the standings appropriations bill.
In addition to the budget bills being passed, there are several pieces of legislation on policy changes on the list for lawmakers to consider. Here is what the Iowa Legislature has passed so far Wednesday:
 Budget bills passed

Judicial branch: Senate File 648, the bill appropriating funding for Iowa’s courts, was sent to the governor by the House in a 86-1 vote. It allocates $221.83 for the state’s judicial branch and includes a 2.5% increase to judicial officer salaries, totalling $1.27 million.
Rep. Ross Wilburn, D-Ames, said he appreciated the raise for judicial pay included in the budget, though he supported further increases so Iowa can enlist and keep qualified judges in the state. He echoed comments made by Sen. Matt Blake, D-Urbandale, Tuesday, pointing to a recent situation where only two candidates applied for a judge opening in Iowa, as a reason why Iowa needs to increase pay.
“I think it’s critical in terms of recruitment, retention, retirement, that we stay competitive, that we have access to an adequate pool of talented justices, court officers, available,” Wilburn said.
Rep. Brian Lohse, R-Bondurant, the bill’s floor manager, said he spoke Thursday morning with former Iowa Rep. Dustin Hite, who was appointed as a district court judge in 2024, who said he believed he was “a better judge because he had been in private practice.” Increasing pay for judges will help the state recruit more lawyers in private practices to take judgeships, Lohse said, who can offer different expertise than county attorneys and lawyers in the public defender’s office or indigent defense – the people who typically take judge positions.
“We have to continue to fight to increase judge pay to a point where it is truly competitive, so that we can get the best applicants available – and from the positions and those areas of the law where we need really good, qualified, well-rounded judges,” Lohse said.
He also said the budget includes a change based on issues identified during the judicial branch’s review of a coding error that caused the misallocation of court debt funds. Lohse said it was discovered roughly $140,000 each year in fees paid by individuals for a court interpreter were being transferred to the jury and witness fee revolving fund instead of into the general fund as intended. The budget bill includes a policy change to continue transferring this money into the revolving fund, he said.
Justice system: Senate File 644, passed 60-27, provides $924.9 million for Iowa’s justice system, including funding for the state’s law enforcement entities including the departments of justice, corrections and public safety. Of that amount, $703.1 million comes from the general fund.
Lohse, who also managed the justice system spending bill, said the measure includes $1.07 million for indigent defense, raising the pay rate by roughly $2 per hour, in addition to transferring $1.95 million from the Indigent Defense Fund to the state Public Defender’s Office for the hiring of 13 new staff.
Rep. Charley Thomson, R-Charles City, said though he supported the bill and Lohse’s efforts to provide funding for indigent defense, the state is still not meeting its legal or moral obligation to provide adequate funding for the lawyers representing people who cannot afford a lawyer.
“It’s pretty simple,” Thomson said. “It’s not that expensive. Yet we are paying so little as a state that we are not able to attract very many competent counsel to do the job while we’re making progress in raising that rate, it is still hopelessly too low. … At some point, sooner rather than later, we’re going to get sued and be compelled to pay adequate amounts.”
Lohse said he agreed with Thomson, saying House lawmakers will come back in 2026 to “continue to fight for indigent defense to do what we can, both in terms of dollars, but also in other legislation.”
The measure also includes $150,000 for the victims assistance grant fund through the Iowa Attorney General’s office to provide services for human trafficking victims, and has a transfer of $100,000 from the public defender’s office to the College Student Aid Commission, providing funding for the Rural Attorney Recruitment Assistance Program.
Rep. Megan Jones, R-Sioux Rapids, proposed but withdrew an amendment to limit the use of “geofencing,” the ability to obtain information from devices being used within geolocational boundaries, to monitor mobile phone use within the Iowa Capitol. The Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation used “geofencing” software in the sports wagering probe that resulted in four Iowa State University athletes facing charges.
She said filings in a lawsuit on the sports wagering case contained information showing geofencing software had been used at the Capitol, a practice she said violated the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution, protecting people from unreasonable searches and seizures from the government.
“The innocent, our constituents, Iowans, our visitors to this very building suffer at the very contemplation that their phones were being geofenced for whatever legal purpose and monitored while they were in this building,” Jones said. “How sad it is that these words have to even be spoken in this building. Iowans, you deserve to be safe in this building, in these hallowed walls. You deserve to be able to seek redress against your government without being feared of being spied on.”
The measure heads to the governor for final approval.
 Policy bills moved through

Unemployment insurance tax: Senate File 607, a bill making changes to Iowa’s unemployment insurance taxes, passed 32-16.
The legislation proposed by Reynolds would cut the taxable wage base used to calculate unemployment insurance taxes in half from 66.7% to 33.4%. It includes other changes, like reducing Iowa’s unemployment tax tables, and excludes wages paid from employers to employees working in other states from the definition of “taxable wages” if the other state extends reciprocity to Iowa.
The measure was amended by Sen. Adrian Dickey, R-Packwood, to remove a section of the bill collecting surcharges from employers of 10% of contributions made to unemployment insurance, if the employer’s average benefit ratio from the past three years was at or more than 1.25.
Democrats proposed multiple amendments, including measures to reverse Iowa’s cuts to unemployment benefits in recent years, each of which failed. Another amendment would have waived work search requirements for people who have seasonal employment.
Senators opposing the legislation and who tried to amend it said this legislation does not help workers but benefits the companies that lay them off. They said it causes residents to find work in another state rather than try to figure out a complicated, burdensome system that won’t provide aid for as long as they need. 
“Our unemployment system is rigged for the employers, particularly with this bill,” Sen. Molly Donahue, D-Marion, said. “It is the workers who hold those businesses up, and we need to do better by those workers, not give more breaks to the employers who are laying them off.” 
Sen. Bill Dotzler, D-Waterloo, said he was “ashamed” of Senate Republicans for how they’re treating workers with the legislation by not allowing more time to take advantage of benefits and helping businesses more than employees. 
Providing unemployment insurance to Iowans doesn’t mean they’re just being handed a check, Dotzler said, it means they have the time to better themselves for employment while they seek it and won’t have to worry as much about finances in the process. 
Dickey called concerns brought up by Democrats “old, tired talking points,” and said the problems they worried about with previous unemployment legislation have not come to fruition. Iowa’s population grew between 2023-2024, he said, countering statements that Iowa is losing workers in favor of going to other states with better pay, benefits and unemployment programs. 
For the lawmakers who said the process to apply for unemployment is too complicated, harming those who need aid, Dickey said they’d be happy to know that Iowa Workforce Development will launch updated websites and materials this summer. 
Dickey acknowledged there are flaws in the current system, including the state’s unemployment fund, and said the Legislature should take time next year to take a hard look at how unemployment works in the state. However, Iowa is third in the nation for average weekly rate of benefits at just over nine weeks. He asked why Iowa would want to be like its neighbors, who have longer averages. 
“The Republican Party has been the party to stand up for Iowa workers,” Dickey said. “We are the party that wants our workers to aspire more than desiring an unemployment check.” 
The House was debating similar legislation Wednesday afternoon.
Expanded Medicaid work requirements: The Iowa House approved an amendment from the Senate on the bill setting work requirements for the Iowa Health and Wellness Plan (IHAWP), sending it to Reynolds for final approval.
Senate File 615 requires IHAWP recipients to work at least 80 hours per month in order to remain eligible for health coverage through the expanded Medicaid program that covers able-bodied adults from ages 19 to 64 with incomes 133% or below the federal poverty level. It includes exceptions for people with high-risk pregnancies, those with children under age 6 and those in substance abuse treatment programs for up to six months. 
The measure also includes “trigger” language that would end IHAWP if the federal government approves, then later rescinds, approval of work requirements.
The Senate amended the bill to remove a provision included in a House amendment to the bill directing Iowa HHS to study and return to lawmakers before the 2026 legislative session with a report on the Medicaid for Employed People with Disabilities (MEPD) program.
The House approved this change. Rep. Carter Nordman, R-Adel, said he was still in support of the study, but said the language was not necessary as Iowa HHS director Kelly Garcia has made a “commitment” to study and discuss the program with lawmakers before the next session.
“I will also commit, while we will be taking this out of the bill, (to) working with Rep. Turek and Director Garcia in the interim to see to it that this still gets done,” Nordman said.
Rep. Josh Turek, D-Council Bluffs, said this provision was a step to ensure “work without worry” efforts – removing the Medicaid asset and income limits for people with disabilities – moves forward. A subcommittee meeting was held on a bill making these changes to Medicaid in 2025, but the measure did not advance.
He said he appreciated work Nordman has done on this issue, and said the issue was with the Senate.
“I think that we should send this back to them,” Turek said. “Let them choke on it.”
Turek and other Democrats also took issue with the bill as a whole. Rep. Beth Wessel-Kroeschell, D-Ames, called the MEPD study “the only good piece in the bill.”
“The governor has already requested this waiver unilaterally,” Wessel-Kroeschell said. “So then the only thing left is to gamble with the lives of over 180,000 Iowans who would lose their health insurance. … That’s the gamble. Stop gambling with the lives of Iowans who make less than $17,000 a year.”
Reynolds and the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services have submitted a waiver request to the federal government to implement work requirements. The HHS proposal is slightly different from the legislative proposal, requiring Iowans on IHAWP work 100 hours per month or earn the equivalent to working 100 hours per month at $7.25 per hour. People can also retain coverage if they are enrolled in education or job skills programs.
The legislation was approved 56-30 and heads to Reynolds’ desk.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)The Florida Supreme Court has indefinitely suspended Broward County Circuit Judge Gary Farmer, the justices announced Wednesday. 
Farmer, who served as Florida Senate Democratic leader for about four months in 2020 and 2021, was recommended to be suspended by Florida’s Judicial Qualifications Commission last month, which concluded he showed “unfitness to serve.” The Supreme Court agreed. 
Judicial oversight panel: Ex-lawmaker’s comments show ‘unfitness to serve’

The suspension is without pay and will be effective Monday. 
“The Court encourages the Commission to conduct any remaining proceedings promptly, in a manner consistent with the Commission’s rules and the procedural rights of the respondent,” Supreme Court documents state. 
The commission investigated comments Farmer made last year, from the bench and in court orders. Some he delivered as “dad jokes” while the commission categorized others as demeaning and potentially humiliating. 
“Through his extensive misconduct, occurring over a lengthy period of time, Judge Farmer has damaged the public’s perception of the judiciary and the judicial branch in such a way that he has demonstrated a present unfitness to serve,” the 13-page recommendation of suspension from April states.

Farmer’s response
Farmer’s response to the commission’s charges last week argued there were “no urgent grounds or genuine exigent circumstances that warrant or require suspension of respondent pending trial or other final outcome of these matters.”

During his service on the bench during the proceedings, “the rendition of justice will not be impaired or undermined,” Farmer’s attorneys wrote. 
“Indeed, Respondent has reflected on his comments and learned lessons. He has been striving to exhibit the highest level of professional conduct.”
The disciplinary process stems from an anonymous letter from prosecutors with the State Attorney’s Office in Broward County, according to court filings. 
Following the complaint, the investigation found, among other documented instances, that Farmer told a litigant expecting three children with different women: “You were just shooting all over the place! That’s good, do you know their names? First and last? Romantic are you? Don’t tell Susie about Jane don’t tell Jane about Mary God bless you man. One’s enough.”
Later, Farmer told the defendant he was going to put him on pretrial release but “I’m going to order that you wear a condom at all times. For your own good. Ok?! Probation is going to check. No, I’m kidding. I’m kidding.”
Other instances include Farmer “prejudging the outcomes of future cases, not yet before him,” relating to laws permitting deadly force in self-defense.
Some of his “dad jokes” were to lighten the mood in the courtroom, Farmer argued: “‘Spring is here, I got so excited I wet my plants’ and ‘What did the shirt say to the pair of pants? Wassup britches!’” and “I called the incontinence hotline. They told me to hold.”
“While some of the comments or jokes made by Respondent were distasteful, no one other than anonymous prosecutors has filed any complaint in any form against Respondent,” Farmer’s attorneys wrote. 
They added that the judge had been experiencing “a sense of depression for the first time in his life” and that “his only relief, and the best part of his day, was his time in court where he believed he was serving a public good and a noble cause.”
“He realizes that what he thought were innocent ‘dad jokes,’ designed to lighten the atmosphere and lessen the tension in the courtroom, were actually ‘bad jokes’ that could undermine confidence in the judicial system by anyone who appears in his courtroom.”

Dan McKee to the Rhode Island Commerce Corp. board of directors. (Courtesy photo)Gov. Dan McKee is betting on a top executive at Bally’s Corp. to help steer the state’s quasi-public economic development agency.
McKee announced his nomination Wednesday of Tracey Wiley, executive director of diversity, equity and inclusion at Bally’s, to the Rhode Island Commerce Corporation board of directors. If approved by the Rhode Island Senate, Wiley will replace board member Dave Chenevert, whose three-year term expired in February. State law allows appointed members of boards and commissions to continue serving beyond the expiration of their terms until a replacement is named.
“Tracey brings a track record of business acumen and experience that speaks for itself,” McKee said in a statement. “Her background as an entrepreneur and champion of small businesses offers a wealth of knowledge and expertise to the Commerce Corporation Board. I look forward to working with her to make our state a more prosperous place for residents, workers, and our economy.”
As part of the 12-member Commerce board of directors, Wiley will help decide how the agency awards its tax credits and economic incentives for small and large businesses, along with marketing initiatives and a student loan repayment program for graduates who work in in-demand fields. McKee also serves as an ex-officio member of the board, only voting to break a tie. For example, in 2022, McKee cast the tie-breaking vote to redirect state tax dollars to help pay for the development of the Centreville Bank Stadium in Pawtucket. 
Wiley in a statement addressed the importance of entrepreneurship and “diversity of thought.”
“Both our small and large businesses, drawn from all corners of our communities, stand as a testament to this, acting together as the driving force behind economic strength and continued growth,” Wiley said. “I am deeply honored by this appointment from Governor McKee to the Commerce Board and am committed to championing the spirit of inclusivity and collaboration, as we forge a future of shared prosperity.”
Wiley joined Bally’s as a consultant in 2021 and the following year assumed a permanent role leading DEI for the company’s 19 casinos and resorts, including in Tiverton and Lincoln, according to her resume obtained by Rhode Island Current. Prior to that, Wiley worked for six years for the state of Virginia, heading its newly created Department of Small Business and Supplier Diversity. Under her direction, the state agency grew its share of contracts awarded to women and minority-owned businesses, and oversaw the distribution of $100 million in federal pandemic grants to 3,000 small businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Wiley also started her own company, Rainmaker Industries Group LLC, in 2021, which she continues to lead today as “chief experience officer,” according to her LinkedIn page. Her resume describes the LLC as a consultancy of “a collection of her work to leverage relationships for the sole purpose of elevating communities of color and creating access to models that build generational wealth for a diverse people.”
A community activist and 25-year survivor of multiple sclerosis, Wiley serves as chairwoman of the board of trustees for the Virginia and West Virginia chapters of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. She also serves on the board for professional NBA and WNBA teams, the Phoenix Suns and Phoenix Mercury, and formerly headed the board of directors for Boston-based former nonprofit Interise, which helps disadvantaged and low-income businesses.
She earned a bachelor’s degree in speech communications from Old Dominion University.
Wiley was also nominated by McKee on April 11 to join the Governor’s Workforce Board. The Rhode Island Senate voted to confirm that appointment on May 8.
The Senate has not yet scheduled a vote on Wiley’s nomination to Commerce, Greg Pare, a Senate spokesperson said Wednesday.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-14 21:00:34+00:00,CT Mirror,Proposed SNAP rules could lead to CT cuts benefits or eligibility,Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/14/proposed-snap-rules-could-mean-ct-cuts-benefits-or-eligibility/,"A new federal cost-sharing plan, plus new rules, are raising concerns about trimming SNAP benefits or eligibility in states like Connecticut.","Federal lawmakers are considering a proposal from Republicans that would for the first time require states to pay for a portion of nutrition benefits for low-income individuals and families. That cost-sharing plan, plus new work requirements, are raising concerns about whether states like Connecticut would need to cut benefits or change eligibility.
The House measure, which is looking for significant cost savings to help pay for the GOP’s larger tax package, would significantly restructure how the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly known as food stamps, is funded.
Since its inception, the federal government fully covers benefits provided to SNAP recipients and shares the administrative costs of running the program equally with each state. Under the new proposal, Congress would institute a cost-sharing program with states and increase state contributions for administrative expenses to 75%.
The new expectations that states may need to start covering benefits in 2028 could place a new burden on Connecticut’s finances and state budget. State officials don’t yet know how exactly that might affect the administration of the program but anticipate that a “redesign” is inevitable if the state cannot cover the costs.
“I don’t think any state is prepared to take on that level of benefit. I don’t want to speak for the governor or the legislature, so I don’t know what priorities they will set and what decisions they will make based on what happens, what budget allocations would be made,” Connecticut Department of Social Services Commissioner Andrea Barton Reeves said in an interview with The Connecticut Mirror.
“But there isn’t a state in the country that has ever had to engage cost sharing with respect to benefits, and our administrative costs have always been shared equally,” she added. “That is something that we always thought was a fair trade around that.”
More than 40 million Americans received food stamps last year. And in Connecticut that same year, nearly 400,000 people, or 1 in 9 state residents, got those benefits, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. More than half of the recipients in the state are in families with children.
In 2024, Connecticut received a total of $885 million in SNAP benefits. Barton Reeves said the total number seems high but noted many recipients receive very small amounts — some seniors only get $60 a month.
If the changes in the federal bill become law, Connecticut would be on the hook for a percentage of that expense each year. That could mean tapping into other funding to cover SNAP or restructuring who qualifies and for how long — hypotheticals the state is not currently entertaining and may need to figure out down the road.
“There’s only certain ways that you can find to cover that gap and that is you try to find another revenue stream somehow. You make a decision with some other program where you would take those resources from. I can’t think of any other place that we would decide is less important or should receive fewer resources in order to move money over,” Barton Reeves said.
“It does fundamentally mean for this and every other state, you’d have to look at how the program is designed, and it may mean that you’d have to look at eligibility standards and duration of benefits, all of the things you look at, which are really just unthinkable quite frankly,” she added.
This week, several House committees have been considering components of the GOP’s major tax package that they are hoping to fully pass in the summer. They are going through the budget reconciliation process to avoid needing 60 votes in the Senate and instead pass a bill on a party-line vote without needing Democrats’ support.
For the past two days, members of the House Agriculture Committee have focused on their part of the plan, which would cut $230 billion to help pay for the overall bill. Those savings would largely come from reforms to SNAP, like stronger work requirements and cost sharing with states.
Under the House GOP proposal, the states would pay a percentage of at least 5% up to 25% based on the error payment rate of the program. Based on 2023 error rate data, the committee estimates Connecticut’s cost-share would be 20%. But that number could change since it would be calculated off of future data from fiscal year 2026.
Barton Reeves said she has larger concerns over the “tolerance threshold” when it comes to SNAP overpayments and underpayments and how that factors into calculating a state’s error rate. The $56 a month threshold would go down to $0, meaning states will have to be near perfect. 
Under the proposed rules, states could face penalties for single-dollar payment errors. She noted that Connecticut has a compliance rate of about 97% when it comes to processing SNAP benefits.
The GOP plan would also impose stronger work requirements for certain able-bodied adults without dependents. For older adults, it would raise the age limit from 54 to 64. The same would also apply to adults with children age 7 or older. They would be required to work or participate in related training for at least 80 hours a month.
Lawmakers on the Agriculture Committee debated a change that would adjust how a dependent is defined since current law exempts able-bodied adults from the work requirement if someone under age 18 lives in their household. Republicans argued children over 7 are school-aged and that will free up parents or caregivers to meet the 20 hours of work a week threshold. Democrats pushed back that kids don’t go to school seven days a week and noted the challenges for families when they are on summer break.
Republicans were looking to avoid directly cutting SNAP benefits in their legislation when looking at ways they could find savings. They argue their plan goes after waste, fraud and abuse in SNAP and will make it function based on its original intent.
“The reforms in the committee markup ensure that SNAP works the way Congress intended it to, and by reinforcing work and instituting long overdue accountability incentives to control cost and end executive and state overreach. This will preserve the integrity and fiscal sustainability of the program moving forward so it can continue to serve the most vulnerable among us,” House Agriculture Committee Chairman GT Thompson, a Republican from Pennsylvania, said at Wednesday’s hearing.
But officials in both red and blue states have warned that the cost-sharing proposal would lead to cuts in order to take on the new costs of the program.
While changes to eligibility or cuts to benefits would have the most direct impact on recipients and families, critics of the plan also raised concerns of what it could mean for farmers and the small food retailers that rely on revenue coming through SNAP.
Speaking from the Whitneyville Food Center in Hamden Tuesday, U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-3rd District, and other stakeholders talked about the effect on all those parties that benefit in some way from SNAP. They noted that the program accounts for about a third of all sales for independent grocers.
“So cutting SNAP benefits now would not only worsen food insecurity, it would also undercut the small food retailers who rely on those dollars to stay in business,” said Tatiana Andreyeva, director of economic initiatives at the UConn Rudd Center for Food Policy and Health.
When talking about eligibility, Meg Hadley Zimmerman, program manager for End Hunger Connecticut!, noted that many students in the state qualify for free and reduced lunches in schools because their family participates in SNAP. She also noted for every dollar spent in SNAP, it generates $1.50 in economic activity in Connecticut.
Back on Capitol Hill, much of Tuesday and Wednesday’s markup of the bill was dominated by discussion over the proposed changes to the nutrition program and the financial burden it could place on states.
“No state has that amount of a budget surplus to backfill all of these programs that are being cut. The thing that we should be able to agree upon is feeding people, hunger is a policy choice once again,” U.S. Rep. Jahana Hayes, D-5th District, said at Tuesday’s hearing. She is the ranking member of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Nutrition, Foreign Agriculture, and Horticulture, and offered amendments to the bill.
“As someone from a donor state that gives more to the federal government than we get back, I know there are many red states that already receive more from the federal government,” Hayes said. “What happens if a state can’t come up with their portion? It means that people in your respective states will lose benefits.”
Hayes offered amendments during the markup, including one to ensure any changes to the program don’t result in cuts. But Republicans hold a majority on the committee and have the numbers to block any amendments and ultimately advance the bill. She argued that states will now be responsible for additional funding including for health care and child care.
“So governors have to worry about food programs, they have to worry about health care, they have to worry about Head Start programs being cut,” Hayes said. “It’s not just one program. It’s not just what we’re considering on this committee.”
The House’s proposal is subject to change, especially once the Senate takes up the tax package. Republicans are hoping to wrap up the entire process, known as budget reconciliation, by the July 4 holiday and get it to President Donald J. Trump’s desk.
Debate in Congress over reforms to government programs keeps coming back to a central question for all states: can they shoulder new costs to continue provide serves and benefits like Medicaid and SNAP at similar levels?
The various proposals under consideration shift more of that responsibility from the federal government to the states.
“It is a way politically for governors of red and blue states to be compelled to make really difficult, unimaginable decisions about how they will provide health care and food support and many other things to their own states given that they have very, very limited budgets in many ways,” Barton Reeves said. 
“It moves the onus away from the feds who are actually making these changes, to make the cuts, onto states, knowing that states don’t have the capacity to absorb all of those cuts,” she continued, “which means that every state now is going to have to make some really difficult decisions about what to do. And we’re no different here in Connecticut.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025_0303_SR_LamontMediaAvailability_056-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-14 17:07:24.528783

Free.,Sweeping private school voucher program tucked inside U.S. House GOP tax bill,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/sweeping-private-school-voucher-program-tucked-inside-us-house-gop-tax-bill,,"WASHINGTON — A national school voucher program got a step closer to becoming law Wednesday, as school choice continues to take heat across the United States.The proposal in the U.S. House would allocate $5 billion a year in tax credits for people donating to organizations that provide private and religious school scholarships and is baked into the Ways and Means Committee’s piece of a massive reconciliation package to fund President Donald Trump’s priorities.The tax credit provision largely reflects the Educational Choice for Children Act — a sweeping bill that GOP Reps. Adrian Smith of Nebraska, Burgess Owens of Utah and Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana reintroduced in their respective chambers earlier this year.The tax-writing committee advanced its measure Wednesday in a party-line vote. Republicans are using the complex reconciliation process to move the package through Congress with simple majority votes in each chamber, avoiding the Senate’s 60-vote legislative filibuster, which would otherwise require bipartisanship.“School choice” is an umbrella term centering on alternative programs to one’s assigned public school. While proponents have argued that school choice programs are necessary for parents dissatisfied with their local public schools, opponents say these efforts drain critical funds and resources from school districts.At a press conference Wednesday, Rep. Elise Stefanik praised the Educational Choice for Children Act, which she cosponsored in the House.The New York Republican said the bill is “a transformative piece of legislation that will expand educational opportunities for children across our nation.”“For too long, students, especially those from underserved communities, have been trapped in failing school systems,” she said, adding that “school choice gives students the opportunity to succeed” and “is the great equalizer.”$20 billion tax credit over 4 yearsThe tax panel’s proposal includes a $20 billion total tax credit, which would be made up of a $5 billion tax credit annually between 2026 and 2029. The scholarships would be available to students whose household incomes do not exceed 300 percent of the median gross income of their area.“This is opening the door to the federal government subsidizing a secondary private system of education that gets to pick and choose who it educates and how it educates kids,” Sasha Pudelski, director of advocacy at AASA, The School Superintendents Association, told States Newsroom.The association helps to ensure every child has access to a high quality public education.“​​I think it’s really important for folks to understand that we are opening this door for the first time to this kind of subsidy,” Pudelski said.The provision also comes as Trump has made school choice a major part of his education agenda.He signed an executive order in January that gave the U.S. secretary of Education two months to offer guidance on how states can use “federal formula funds to support K-12 educational choice initiatives.”More oppositionOrganizations that advocate for students with disabilities, including the National Center for Learning Disabilities, the Council for Exceptional Children, the Center for Learner Equity, and The Arc of the United States, fiercely opposed the bill, highlighting concerns that it is not sufficient in providing enforceable protections for students with disabilities and their families.In a statement, Jacqueline Rodriguez, CEO of the National Center for Learning Disabilities, said “the guarantee of rights and protections for students with disabilities using these vouchers is disingenuous at best and crooked at worst, without the other critical provisions of IDEA,” or the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.“It is quite possible that families with disabilities will use a voucher under the pretense that their child will have the same rights when in fact they do not,” Rodriguez said.",,,,2025-05-14 17:07:24.528783

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderDozens of Kennesaw State University students and others gathered outside University System of Georgia offices in Atlanta Wednesday to ask the Board of Regents not to eliminate majors in Black studies, philosophy and technical communication.
The university announced last month that it plans to eliminate the three majors, citing low enrollment numbers.
Kennesaw State University spokeswoman Tammy DeMel said the programs did not meet the graduation standards required by all majors.
“Undergraduate programs are expected to maintain a three-year rolling average of at least 10 graduates per year. The Black Studies major has a three-year graduation average of 5.7 degrees per year, while Philosophy averages 6.3 and Technical Communications 7.7,” DeMel said.
“The programs underwent a multi-year remediation process, which included annual improvement plans focused on increasing enrollment,” she added. “As the required benchmarks were not met, the University deactivated these programs.”
DeMel said the school will ensure current students majoring in those subjects will have the opportunity to complete their degrees, and courses from those subjects will continue to be offered as minors or electives.

That wasn’t much comfort for students outside the offices Wednesday, some of whom disputed the university’s numbers. Students characterized the move as preemptively folding to pressure from the state and federal governments.
President Donald Trump’s administration has threatened to investigate and withhold federal funding from universities that promote “diversity, equity and inclusion.” Kennesaw State has been moving forward with plans to shut down resource centers for groups like LGBTQ students and students of color.
The Georgia Senate passed a bill this year that would have banned DEI programs and policies from all state public schools and universities, but the measure did not get a vote in the House.
Simran Mohanty, a third-year KSU student majoring in sociology on the pre-law track, said philosophy classes have prepared her to study law.
“Philosophy helps a lot with critical and analytical thinking,” she said. “You typically have a lot of readings to do, so you have to be able to critically analyze the readings, which is really good for pre-law students who need to read legal briefs or long case documents such as that, and it also helps to have analytical thinking of being able to analyze those readings and apply it to real-world context, practical context. So philosophy has been monumental in my studies.”
KSU student Jacob Waller, who is seeking a double major in philosophy and psychology, said he fears doing away with the majors would prevent students who want to dip their toes in the field from doing so.

“You’re cutting institutional support to the major so that all of the rigor and the quality of the classes as it is currently – which is very incredible due to our four professors, we only have four people in the department but they’re all incredible and work very hard to make sure that the sanctity of the space is preserved – the quality of those classes is going to diminish significantly by getting rid of the major because you’re cutting most of the systemic support for it.”
Stephan Sellers, a third-year mechatronics major who has taken philosophy and Black studies courses, said they have been some of the most important of his college career.
“Those courses teach us not only who we are, but the history of our diaspora from the African continent,” he said. “And those studies also teach us that we have a voice, we have power, and so with these studies being taken away, I can see that some of the students coming in will miss out on very vital parts of their education.”
The Georgia Board of Regents is set to meet Thursday, but a vote on the majors is not scheduled on the agenda.

(U.S. Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service/Flickr)An update to Arkansas’ surface-water quality rules was pulled from the Legislature’s Joint Public Health Committee’s agenda Wednesday to give lawmakers more time to consider it.
Meanwhile,  a Department of Human Services rule, which would change state Medicaid rules to allow recipients up to two urgent care visits a year without a doctor’s referral, was sent to a subcommittee for further consideration after multiple legislators expressed concern about whether the text of the rule could have unintended consequences.
The changes to Rule 2, which contains the water quality standards for rivers, lakes and other surface waters in the state, were brought before the committee by the Department of Energy and Environment’s Division of Environmental Quality. 
States such as Arkansas that have been authorized to administer the federal Clean Water Act are required to undergo this review every three years to update existing water quality standards.
Committee chair Sen. Missy Irvin, R-Mountain View, said Rule 2 would likely receive its own hearing in June or July, separate from the committee’s other business.
The regulation containing Arkansas’ existing water quality standards was already long, and the current review introduced a number of changes. DEQ is making cadmium and ammonia standards — which are from 1986 and 1999, respectively — more stringent to match the standards set by the EPA in 2016 and 2013 for those pollutants. Additionally, DEQ included standards for five new pollutants not currently in the regulation. 
These pollutants — benzene, ethylbenzene, phenol, toluene and xylene — can have a wide variety of detrimental effects on human health. The standards are “health-based,” the division said in its documentation, and are meant to protect the health of humans and wildlife exposed to the state’s surface waters.
“I think [committee members] needed more time to review it,” Irvin said after the meeting concluded. “There were a lot of public comments, as well as comments from other state agencies and constitutional offices — so a lot of questions.”
The Arkansas Department of Transportation and Arkansas Game and Fish Commission submitted feedback during the public comment period earlier this year. While ARDOT questioned when the new standards would become applicable to permit holders and how the change from a fecal coliform bacteria standard to an e. coli standard would affect permits, AGFC continued its requests to designate more waters in the state as “Extraordinary Resource Waters” in order to protect vulnerable and endangered species. 
The agency made a similar request in 2020, during the last triennial review.
  Medicaid and Urgent Care 

A proposed amendment to a DHS rule aiming to hasten access to urgent care clinics for Medicaid recipients was referred to the Human Services subcommittee.
Representatives from the department said the goal of the change was to divert patients from emergency rooms when there were other treatment options available. The need for a referral was a barrier to this when medical care became necessary after hours and a referral could not be obtained.
The rule would allow Medicaid recipients with a primary care provider to go to an urgent care clinic twice a year without a referral, while those “who are not yet assigned” a PCP would be allowed to go up to four times. Referrals would be required after the number of yearly visits are exhausted.
Some lawmakers instantly took issue with the rule’s language. Rep. Aaron Pilkington, R-Knoxville, said he was opposed to the change due to concerns it would remove incentives for Medicaid recipients to obtain a primary care provider.
“It seems like this flies in the face of what the Legislature has been doing the last decade, trying to get more people to have an assigned PCP who is someone who can actually be the quarterback of their care,” Pilkington said. 
Research has found people with a PCP tend to have better health outcomes than those without one, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
“We want to preserve the bond between a patient and their PCP,” said Nell Smith, DHS’ deputy director of medical services. “That’s why we still require a PCP referral [after a certain number of visits]. We don’t want to shift care onto urgent care clinics.”
However, Smith said, when these patients need care outside of business hours, they’re being sent to the emergency room because of difficulties obtaining referrals.
“It’s a fine balance, I’ll give you that,” Smith said. 
Sen. John Payton, R-Wilburn, appeared to take issue with requiring referrals for urgent care clinics at all.
“This referral process can really slow down medical care,” he said, explaining how one of his employees was “sitting at home” in pain because of the wait to see a specialist. That employee visited the emergency room twice while waiting for an appointment, Payton said. 
“I think we should be evaluating whether or not the urgent care clinic is capable of diagnosing and treating more than we worry about how the patient got there and whether they were referred or not,” he said.
While he understood trying to get Medicaid recipients to get an appointment with a primary care provider, Payton said urgent care clinics also had licensed physicians and nurses capable of treating and diagnosing conditions. 
Irvin cautioned that it was important the department make its definitions within the rule clear after multiple lawmakers also asked questions about how the rule defined an emergent care clinic. She said many PCPs offer day clinics for these purposes and it was important that the rule didn’t cause them to be “skipped out on.”
Irvin ultimately moved the rule to the joint Human Services subcommittee for further consideration. The subcommittee is headed by Pilkington.
The agency received no public comments on the rule.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/wetlands.jpeg,,,2025-05-14 17:07:24.528783

May 14, 2025. | ScreenshotA former aide to former House Speaker Jason Wentworth (R-Farwell) has been charged with multiple counts of embezzlement and criminal enterprise.
Attorney General Dana Nessel’s office has been investigating David Coker Jr., 51, of Clare, since late 2023.
A spokesperson for the Michigan Department of Attorney General confirmed for the Michigan Advance that their office fulfilled search and arrest warrants as part of a “high-profile” investigation Wednesday morning but said Nessel will make more information available Thursday.
Court records confirm Coker was arraigned Wednesday in Lansing’s 54A District Court on seven charges. A probable cause conference is set for May 23.
Coker created a nonprofit that was awarded a $25 million no-bid grant written into the state budget by Wentworth, his former boss, Bridge Michigan reports.
Current House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) said in a statement that “shady deals like this were the norm in Lansing for far too long.”
He said the deal demonstrates the need for a package of government ethics and transparency bills he sponsored.
“We’re going to let the Attorney General do her job and see this investigation through, keep an eye on what comes out during the proceedings to see if other changes are needed and continue passing new ethics and transparency measures across state government,” Hall said.

The state Department of Commerce received word of the canceled funding Friday. That was one day after President Donald Trump called the Digital Equity Act that created the grant program “racist” and “unconstitutional.”
The letter the U.S. Department of Commerce sent state officials on Friday followed the same logic, calling the digital equity program “unconstitutional.” It said “grants issued pursuant to it were created with, and administered using, impermissible and unconstitutional racial preferences.”
States across the nation have received similar notices.
The federal law, authored by Washington U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, was included in the bipartisan infrastructure package President Joe Biden signed in 2021. It is meant to help groups ranging from veterans, to disabled people, to older Americans and rural communities. People of color could also benefit from the federal money. 
In a call with reporters Wednesday, the Democratic senator said it is “absolutely nuts that Trump is blocking resources to help make sure kids in rural districts can get hotspots or laptops all because he doesn’t like the word ‘equity.’”
In total, the Digital Equity Act provided about $2.75 billion, with $60 million initially going to states in 2022 to develop equity plans for internet access. The feds then doled out money to put those plans into effect.
States led by Democrats and Republicans alike had been planning to spend the funding. Washington was awarded nearly $16 million in December, about a month before Trump took office.
The state Department of Commerce planned to spend the money on establishing a Broadband Cybersecurity Literacy Program so Washingtonians know how to use internet-related technology safely. The program would develop a curriculum to be incorporated into existing digital literacy training. Such training is included in the state’s Digital Equity Plan.
“It’s about building a future where every person in Washington, regardless of their background or where they live, has the resources and knowledge they need to participate fully in our digital society,” the state’s then-Commerce Director Mike Fong said at the time the grant was awarded.
Washington hadn’t spent any of the money, but was about to award a contract to develop the curriculum, said Commerce spokesperson Amelia Lamb.
Aaron Wheeler, the director of the Washington State Broadband Office, said the funding termination “perpetuates existing disparities that fall most heavily on our state’s rural communities.”
“It will increase inequalities,” Wheeler told reporters. “The digital divide will widen, further impacting vulnerable populations and limiting their access to education, employment, health care and civil engagement opportunities.”
The Trump administration is likely to face court challenges over the canceled grants, as it has for many other instances of terminated federal funding.
This money is separate from $1.2 billion Washington has received from the feds through the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment Program. The funding, known by the acronym BEAD, goes toward directly improving internet infrastructure in rural communities and other areas lacking high-speed internet service. 
So far, the Trump administration hasn’t frozen that money. 
By the end of January, the state had received over 300 applications for pieces of that $1.2 billion. Wheeler expects to have a plan on how to spend the money submitted to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration by the fall. 
Some experts fear the Trump administration is trying to steer money away from fiber networks and toward satellite internet, with Elon Musk’s Starlink as a beneficiary of the change. 
But Washington is proceeding with caution, given the word “equity” is in the BEAD name. Wheeler said the state is waiting for further guidance from the telecommunications agency. 
“Things change overnight,” he added, “and we’re just kind of being very, very cognizant of what may be going on.”

(Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)A federal appeals court on Wednesday found that the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa and Spirit Lake Nation don’t have standing to bring a voting discrimination claim against the state of North Dakota.
The 8th Circuit Court of Appeals in a 2-1 decision overturned a 2023 decision by a North Dakota federal judge that found the state’s 2021 redistricting plan unlawfully diluted the tribes’ voting power. 
Attorneys representing the tribes say the appellate court’s ruling eliminates voters’ ability to challenge racial discrimination under the Voting Rights Act in North Dakota and the six other 8th Circuit states.
The Campaign Legal Center in a Wednesday statement called the decision a “stunningly antidemocratic move.” 
“This decision severely undermines the Voting Rights Act and is contrary to both the intent of Congress in enacting the law and to decades of Supreme Court precedent affirming voters’ power to enforce the law in court,” said Mark Gaber, senior director for redistricting at the Campaign Legal Center.
Tribes, state argue redistricting case to federal appeals court

The appellate court already limited voters’ ability to challenge potential violations of the Voting Rights Act in 2023, when it decided private citizens cannot bring lawsuits under Section 2 of the law, which protects voters against racial discrimination. Only the U.S. attorney general can file such claims, the court ruled.
For a time, the question remained open as to whether voters have the right to bring those same allegations under a separate federal civil rights law: Section 1983 of Title 42 of the United States Code.
On Wednesday, a panel of 8th Circuit judges decided the answer is no. The language of the Voting Rights Act does not authorize citizens to file race discrimination claims through Section 1983, Judge Raymond Gruender wrote in the majority opinion.
Chief Judge Steven Colloton dissented. He noted that Section 1983 says people may sue for “the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws.”
“The reference to ‘and laws’ encompasses any law of the United States,” Colloton wrote.
His dissent also criticizes the court’s 2023 decision, writing that Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act “expressly forbids ‘a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color.’” Since 1982, private plaintiffs have brought more than 400 actions based under Section 2, he wrote.
The lawsuit originated from a legislative redistricting plan approved by the North Dakota Legislature in 2021 following the 2020 Census that put the Turtle Mountain and Spirit Lake reservations in new districts.
Judge selects legislative district map in tribal voting rights case

The Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa, Spirit Lake Nation and three Native North Dakota voters in 2022 filed a federal lawsuit against the North Dakota Secretary of State’s Office over the map, arguing the plan was discriminatory because it weakened the power of Native voters. The lawsuit was brought under both Section 1983 and Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.
U.S. District Judge Peter Welte in 2023 ruled in favor of the tribes and in January 2024 ordered the map be substituted with one that placed the reservations in the same voting district.
The Secretary of State’s Office appealed the ruling, asking the 8th Circuit to overturn Welte’s decision on the basis that the tribes don’t have standing to sue and that the redistricting plan was not discriminatory. The parties presented oral arguments to the 8th Circuit in October.
North Dakota Attorney General Drew Wrigley and Secretary of State Michael Howe did not immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday.
In October, North Dakota Solicitor General Philip Axt argued on behalf of the Secretary of State’s Office. He told the judges that the plaintiffs want “to go back to an ancient regime where private rights were inferred from congressional silence.”
The 8th Circuit in its Wednesday order sent the case back to Welte and directed him to dismiss the lawsuit. It was not immediately clear what impact the decision could have on the voting districts. The appellate court’s opinion does not speak to the validity of the redistricting plan itself, only that the plaintiffs lack the right to sue in the first place.
“Today’s ruling wrongly forecloses voters disenfranchised by a gerrymandered redistricting map, as Native voters in North Dakota have been, from challenging that map under the Voting Rights Act,” Native American Rights Funds Staff Attorney Lenny Powell said in a Wednesday statement published by the Campaign Legal Center.
Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Chairman Jamie Azure and Spirit Lake Nation Chairperson Lonna Jackson-Street did not respond to requests for comment Wednesday.
The court’s decision is only binding in the 8th Circuit, which includes North Dakota, South Dakota, Arkansas, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri and Nebraska.

The federally mandated nonprofit, known as a protection and advocacy organization, was awaiting $700,000 of its federal funding for the current fiscal year. On May 1, it announced it would stop taking new cases as a result of the delay. 
The organization’s leaders said they can see the available funds in the online portal and are resuming all the services that were placed on pause. 
“I was very much elated to see the money had come in this morning,” said Polly Tribble, executive director at Disability Rights Mississippi. “It has allowed us to take a breather, so we aren’t looking at immediate layoffs.”
The organization received no explanation for the delay, DRMS Communications Director Jane Carroll told Mississippi Today. 
The delays affected five of the organization’s larger programs, funded through the Department of Health and Human Services. The programs allowed DRMS to investigate reports of neglect and abuse and to advocate for voter accessibility for those with disabilities – among other services.

However, there are a couple of other top-down changes already implemented or on the horizon, Tribble said.
Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) launched a “defend the spend” initiative which mandates organizations like DRMS provide line-by-line justification of spending. So far, Tribble says her organization hasn’t received any pushback about its expenditures. 
Tribble and similar organizations in other states still have concerns about future funding, however.  A draft of President Donald Trump’s proposed 2026 budget shows eliminations or significant funding reductions of many of DRMS’ programs. 
“Our concern for FY ‘26 still remains … But for now, we’re celebrating this, and we will keep fighting for our clients this month ahead as they firm up a budget.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/06154617/3X0A9444.jpg,,,2025-05-14 17:07:24.528783

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd) LOUISVILLE — Saying “hunger knows no political boundaries,” Dare to Care president and CEO Vincent James urged Congress not to cut Medicaid, SNAP and other safety-net programs. 
Doing so could increase an already “unimaginable” spike in food insecurity in the Louisville area and Southern Indiana, James said. 
James gathered with anti-hunger advocates and religious leaders in the Dare to Care food bank on Fern Valley Road Wednesday, the same day the nonprofit Feeding America released results from the latest Map the Meal Gap study, showing food insecurity is on the rise in the area. 
Over the last two years, Dare to Care has seen a 48% increase in food insecurity in the 13 counties it serves. In Louisville and the surrounding region, 1 in 7 people — including 1 in 5 children — live with food insecurity, which means they don’t have enough to eat and may not know where their next meal will come from. 
James said people are feeling the loss of pandemic-era assistance. “If you think back to 2020 when there were a lot of COVID benefits, you had child tax credits, you had so many other benefits that were coming to our community and to individuals to be able to help them to build that bridge of the gap that they had with their resources every month,” James said. “But when those benefits were cut around two or three years ago, we’re now seeing the impact of those cuts.” 
With Medicaid and SNAP — the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — facing likely funding cuts in the Republican Congress, there’s a real concern that Dare to Care, which provides food to people who need it in parts of Kentucky and Southern Indiana, won’t be able to keep up, James said. 
“If you think about a senior who is getting Social Security and also some other benefits — Medicaid, Medicare — and now (if) those things are being cut, that means that they’ve got to pay for it in some kind of way — the money that they were using, most likely, for food,” James explained. “That’s when we actually see and hear stories where we have seniors who are adding water to soup so it can stretch longer. No one should be in that situation.”

Joining James were religious leaders — Archbishop Shelton J. Fabre from the Archdiocese of Louisville, Imam Muhammad Almoutem of the Muslim Community Center of Louisville, the Rev. Martin Brooks of Peace Catalyst International and several others — who said that their respective faiths call on them to feed all hungry people. 
Cantor David Lipp from Congregation Adath Jeshurun called feeding the hungry a religious and moral “mandate.” Fabre said feeding people is a way to recognize “basic human dignity.” 
Almoutem said “ignoring the people in need, and in particular the hungry people, is a form of sin” in his religion. 
These faith leaders gathered in support of Dare to Care and the continued funding of programs to feed and otherwise help people to, as James said, show a united front in the message that “no one will go hungry in our community again.” 
James added: “We’re deeply concerned about the increase of food insecurity that we’ve seen, the lack of access to being able to have access to fresh food we’ve seen, simultaneously faced with the threats and cuts to some of the nutritious programs that are run by our federal government.”
Map the Meal Gap
The 2025 Map the Meal Gap report, based on data from 2023, shows that about 70% of food insecure Kentuckians fall below the threshold that qualifies them for SNAP benefits; about 30% are above it. 
In total, 753,410 Kentuckians are food insecure, according to the report. In 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic, that number was 644,540. 
Children, people of color, the LGBTQ+ community, immigrants, people with disabilities, formerly incarcerated people, single-parent households and people living in the South. are more likely to be food insecure, according to the report. 
Overall, nearly 17% of Kentuckians have a shortage of food, the new data shows.
Other data points from the report showed that nationally: 

Hungry people live in all — 100% — of counties and congressional districts. 
Child food insecurity affects every county and district, with rates reaching almost 50% in some areas. 
More than 12 million seniors and older adults experience food insecurity. 
86% of counties with the highest food insecurity are in the South. 
86% of counties with the highest food insecurity are rural. 
Among counties with available estimates, rates of food insecurity for Black or Latino individuals reach nearly 60%. 
More than 2 out of 5 people facing hunger are unlikely to qualify for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). 
The national food budget shortfall has risen to more than $32 billion. 
The national average cost per meal is $3.58 in 2023. 
County meal costs range from $2.60 to $6.09. 

Addressing this need is a “bipartisan effort,” James said. “We cannot afford any cuts to programs that are providing nutritious food for our neighbors.” 
“Every side knows that every human deserves the right to eat. It’s not even a question of a political stance,” he said. “It’s a question of your humanity, that each person has to have an opportunity to have access to food.”

(Photo by Christine Sexton/Florida Phoenix)Trial attorney John Morgan took Tallahassee by storm on Wednesday as he joked, dropped f-bombs, and gave his “no bullshit” take on politics in America and Florida.
But when it was done and over, he maintained he is “serious” about a possible run for governor.
By his own reckoning, Morgan’s extensive experience with helping to finance proposed constitutional amendments for medical marijuana in 2016, increases in minimum wage in 2020, and legalization of marijuana in 2024, have given him the campaign chops he needs if he does choose to run for governor. 
Morgan also acknowledged he has plenty of name recognition due to his role as the founder and face of the Morgan & Morgan law firm.
He figures he can afford to wait and see how other candidates fare down the “home stretch.” He likened it to running a sprint rather than a marathon.
“I’d rather have a three-month window than an 18-month window,” he said.
While Morgan was less than firm about his run for office, he said he is moving ahead with real plans to form a third party in the state. A new party is necessary, he said, because the existing parties have been hijacked by factions that he doesn’t feel represent many of their members.
Republicans are controlled by supporters of Donald Trump as opposed to “country club Republicans,” Morgan said, while Democrats are in the thrall of progressives and “socialists” such as U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders. He said that both sides refuse to compromise.
He argued that the polarization in the country is because many people are angry over income inequality and it helped lead Trump supporters to riot on Jan. 6.
“We’re stuck in the middle, and we don’t have a voice, any voice, but yet, we have a lot to say, but we’re paralyzed,” Morgan said. “So my belief is this: I believe that we need a third party.”

Morgan said he will choose the party’s name through a competition he will sponsor with a cash prize for the winning entry. He said he has already brought in a lawyer to help draft the paperwork to launch the party.
In addition to discussing his political future, Morgan weighed in on Florida’s current political events as well as its past.
He took repeated shots at DeSantis and said the 2023 insurance changes meant to lower property coverage rates were a “a money grab” for the governor to run for president.
“And who lost? Every homeowner in Florida. There’s going to be a day of reckoning. There’s going to be a hurricane, and it’s going to be bad,” he said.
Morgan facetiously spoke about DeSantis being a “hard-working governor,” noting that he saw him at the Kentucky Derby in Churchill Downs on May 3 and a Formula 1 sprint event at the Miami Grand Prix later the next day.
“So, he’s always working for us, constantly working for us and for our benefit,” Morgan said. 
Morgan conceded being a “billionaire” who lives in Maui during the winter. He says he “smokes a lot of dope out there” because it’s “relaxing.”
He recalled earlier this year getting texts and videos of the governor invoking his name “everywhere” and talking about his sway with members of the Legislature. Given the alleged influence he has over legislators, Morgan said he had a simple question for them: “When the f— are they gonna start doing what I tell them to do?”
He declared the Democratic Party of Florida dead and put the blame squarely on former Tallahassee mayor and 2020 Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Andrew Gillum, who lost his bid for governor by 34,000 votes in 2018 to DeSantis.
Morgan also opined that the Legislature shouldn’t meet every year but every other year instead.
“Because every time they meet they screw us over,” Morgan said.
He questioned whether Florida needs its Governor’s Mansion, a lieutenant governor, or agriculture commissioner.
He predicted the latest effort to legalize marijuana in Florida will pass despite the constitutional ballot changes the Legislature recently passed and DeSantis signed into law. 
“It’s sickening, because what it means is politicians want to have total control so they can take care of their special interests — cable companies, the fire companies, the sugar people. They don’t want us to have a say, because they know we, the people, are dangerous. We’re dangerous when we get to vote, and they don’t want that,” he said.

Under the plan, up to 512,000 adults in Michigan could lose coverage due to new, punitive work requirements.
This latest news comes at a time when Michiganders have sent a loud-and-clear message that they don’t want cuts to Medicaid. In fact, according to new statewide polling results released last week, 83% of Michigan voters across political views and party affiliations want to see Medicaid spending either increased or kept the same. EPIC·MRA, with support from the Community Mental Health Association of Michigan, Michigan Association of Health Plans, Michigan Health & Hospital Association, Michigan Primary Care Association, and Protect MI Care, conducted the new statewide poll to determine where Michiganders stand on the proposed Medicaid cuts. The poll also showed that 82% of Michiganders oppose cutting Medicaid to pay for tax cuts and 80% said Medicaid is important in their communities. 
More than 2.6 million Michiganders — including more than 1 million children — rely on Medicaid for their health care coverage. This includes 1 in 5 adults ages 19-64, 2 in 5 children, 3 in 5 nursing home residents, 1 in 6 Medicare beneficiaries and 3 in 8 working-age adults with disabilities.These are our family members, friends, co-workers and neighbors, and they live in every county in our state. Each and every one of them deserves to be able to access the care they need in order to live healthy lives. 
Health care providers, advocates urge Michigan congressional delegation to vote no on Medicaid cuts

In addition to providing health care coverage to nearly half of Michigan’s kids, Medicaid covered 45% of all babies born in our state last year and allows more than 270,000 older Michiganders to live safely at home or in caregiving facilities. It also serves as a lifeline for Michiganders seeking care at behavioral health and substance use treatment centers in rural and underserved areas, and, statewide, it protects families who otherwise couldn’t afford care from serious health consequences and insurmountable financial burdens. 
Medicaid is foundational to Michigan’s health care delivery systems, providing an essential source of funding for hospitals, nursing homes, Community Mental Health Services Programs, schools and Emergency Medical Services. The program brings over $19 billion in federal funding to Michigan, supporting care, providers and thousands of jobs. 
In addition to stripping health care away from hundreds of thousands of Michiganders, the implementation and administration of the House GOP’s proposed work requirements would lead to exorbitant administrative costs, with Michigan taxpayers footing a potential $155 million bill in the first year alone. This is funding that would be put to much better use as a means to maintain and, better yet, increase health care coverage for the people who call Michigan home.
The plan also proposes tax “reforms” that could result in a $3 billion annual loss in funding for our state, including a $2.3 billion decrease in payments to Michigan hospitals and upwards of $325 million in cuts to nursing homes. The closures of hospitals and other health care facilities are a real possibility under this plan, which would be deeply felt in rural and underserved areas where health care accessibility is already a major issue.
Let’s be clear: this new plan is an all-out assault on Medicaid that would push families off coverage, overwhelm hospitals with uncompensated care and deepen workforce shortages in essential health care services.
We here at the Michigan League for Public Policy continue to stand strong in our fight to protect Medicaid, and we do not stand alone. We stand together with the majority of Michiganders and the more than 150 organizations that make up the Protect MI Care coalition. The stakes right now could not be higher, which is why the League is proud to have helped launch the Protect MI Care coalition in order to build a united front against any cuts or caps to Medicaid. The health and well-being of Michiganders and our state economy depend on it.

(Photo by Stew Milne for Alabama Reflector)Alabama’s U.S. Sen. Tommy Tuberville participated in a charity golf tournament in Birmingham Wednesday, just hours before the U.S. Senate was scheduled to take up confirmations of personnel in President Donald Trump’s administration.
Tuberville was scheduled to appear at the 2025 Regions Tradition on Wednesday, a charity golf tournament located at the Greystone Golf & Country Club. Other people scheduled to appear included former Auburn football player Bo Jackson, Auburn head football Coach Hugh Freeze and UAB Head Football Coach Trent Dilfer.
“The senator is in Alabama today for a charity golf tournament that he goes to every year. He is planning to be back in D.C. for votes later this evening,” said Mallory Blount Jaspers, a spokeswoman for Tuberville, on Wednesday.
Tuberville participated in the charity event in 2023 and 2024, which is expected to raise more than $24 million with Children’s of Alabama, a pediatric acute care children’s hospital located in Birmingham.
The U.S. Senate schedule for the day includes a full slate of confirmation votes for senators to consider, including the morning, which Tuberville will likely forego while in Alabama.
The U.S. Senate generally holds a four-day work week, with the first vote on Monday at 5:30 p.m. and the last vote typically taking place Thursday afternoon at 1:45 p.m.
The Senate is set to be in recess for 15 weeks this year, in addition to the regular long weekends. The chamber was set to hold eight votes on Wednesday, including to confirm Emil Michael to be undersecretary for research and engineering at the Department of Defense and for Eric Ueland to become deputy director for management at the Office of Management and Budget.

Other members of the Senate have missed votes this year, including Rhode Island Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, who was in South Korea in late April for the “Our Ocean Conference.” Whitehouse missed a vote on a measure to reject President Donald Trump’s tariff policy. That measure failed on a tied 49-49 vote.
It likely would have been approved had Whitehouse been there. Kentucky Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell, who previously indicated opposition to Trump’s tariff policies, also missed the vote.
“The Our Ocean summit was important for Rhode Island and climate issues, and for preserving American leadership in the world,” Whitehouse said in a statement to Rhode Island Current. “Ocean and climate problems are grave and serious and ignored. There would have been zero U.S. presence had I not attended.”
Whitehouse said he had informed leadership that he would be traveling on official business.
“I would have voted against Trump’s harmful tariffs had the vote not been called while I was away, but the measure was never going to become law in any event and calling the vote as a tie let us put J.D. Vance on record voting for the tariffs,” Whitehouse said.

Photo by David Goodman/VTDiggerThe Vermont Conversation with David Goodman is a VTDigger podcast that features in-depth interviews on local and national issues. Listen below and subscribe for free on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or wherever you get podcasts.Mohsen Mahdawi is a free man. That has not come easily. It has taken a national human rights campaign to free Mahdawi and keep him free. He is among the first people in the country to be freed from detention under President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown. Mohsen Mahdawi is a Columbia University student and Palestinian activist who was arrested in Vermont by immigration agents last month at what he was told would be a citizenship interview. Mahdawi, 34, grew up in a refugee camp in the Israeli-occupied West Bank but is now a legal permanent resident living in Vermont. He is a practicing Buddhist and was president of the Columbia University Buddhist Association and he co-founded Columbia’s Palestinian Student Union.Mahdawi’s immigration interview on April 14 was supposed to be the last step in his 10-year journey to become a U.S. citizen. But it was a trap. Upon completing his interview, he was whisked away in unmarked SUVs by armed and masked federal agents. He was accused by the State Department of posing a threat to national security over his pro-Palestine campus activism. Mahdawi was keenly aware of President Trump’s ominous crackdown on immigrants. Other international students who were in the U.S. with valid student visas or were legal permanent residents were being snatched off the street and quickly shipped to a prison in Louisiana, where judges were more sympathetic to the Trump administration’s effort to deport them. Mahdawi alerted Vermont’s congressional delegation to his fear of being arrested and he contacted attorneys to act swiftly in the event he was detained. Just as he anticipated, the federal agents who arrested him hustled him to the Burlington airport where he was to be put on a plane to Louisiana. This followed a well-worn script — until Mahdawi missed his flight. That gave time for his lawyers to make an emergency appeal to Vermont federal Judge William Sessions III, who immediately issued an order blocking the Trump administration from removing him from Vermont. Mahdawi was in immigration custody in Vermont for 16 days. On April 30, Vermont Judge Geoffrey Crawford ordered Mahdawi’s release on bail, comparing his arrest to the unlawful repression of free speech under McCarthyism. The Trump administration is continuing its effort to deport Mahdawi. For now, he can continue his fight for freedom outside of prison. (Disclosure: the ACLU of Vermont, where I am a board member, is part of Mahdawi’s legal team.) Mohsen Mahdawi is planning to attend his graduation from Columbia University next week and to begin graduate studies at Columbia’s School of International and Public Affairs in September.I met Mohsen Mahdawi near his home in the rural Upper Connecticut River Valley. He said he preferred to be outside in nature, his sanctuary. He asked me to join him on a favorite hike through a forest and up a hillside with beautiful views. Following is an excerpt of our Vermont Conversation edited for length and clarity. You can hear the full conversation at the audio link at the top of this article.David Goodman  You have just come out of several weeks in jail. What does it mean to you to be out here?Mohsen Mahdawi  My most beautiful memories of being in harmony, at peace and feeling tranquility happened in these mountains. This is the same path that I walked when I was processing my pain and going through healing for my trauma. Even though I was in prison, I was not imprisoned. I was able to imagine myself when I was in the cell, walking, hiking the forest, laying in a hammock, hearing this beautiful sound of water.David Goodman  What trauma are you referring to?Mohsen Mahdawi  I’m referring to the journey of my childhood, of the little Mohsen who grew up in a refugee camp, who has lived through war, who has been horrified by seeing loved ones being killed unjustly at the hands of the Israeli army. And the little Mohsen who thought many times that his life is about to be over, lived in trauma and pain and fear. The first place where I was able to process and to sit with those memories and the place that I felt safe, which I’m grateful for, was Vermont.David Goodman  How did growing up in a refugee camp in the West Bank lead you to Columbia University?Mohsen Mahdawi  Fire and pressure form something beautiful. The fire of injustice and the pressure of living in such difficult conditions, under basically military occupation and apartheid, pushed me forward. The magic recipe really is hope and education. I never gave up and I always believed in the idea of justice. My uncle, who was killed on my 11th birthday, was inspiration to remind me that my only way is education, that education is light, education is hope. David Goodman  What will it mean to you to walk across the stage at Columbia to get your bachelor’s degree?Mohsen Mahdawi  It means many things. I will be walking and thinking of my uncle’s spirit and praying that it’s hovering above me and seeing that the advice that he gave me has fueled my energy to get to this point. I want to also be an uncle to every child who grows up in severe and difficult conditions giving the same message that my uncle gave me, that education is light and education will open many paths for you to change the reality. And the last part is a message to the tyrants who don’t want me to graduate, who want me to lose this opportunity for making peace and bringing justice to my people and to both Israelis and Palestinians. It’s a message that no power in this world can take away from me, my power for imagination to see a peaceful future for the children, Israelis and Palestinians.David Goodman  You when you emerged from prison in Vermont two weeks ago, you addressed President Trump directly and said, “I am not afraid of you.” What did you mean by that? Mohsen Mahdawi  I wanted to say that intimidation, bullying, harassment will not stop me from working for this great cause for humanity, for democracy, for the Palestinian people. It is my life, it’s my family’s life, and I refuse to be silenced.David Goodman  You were going right to the heart of the power of an autocrat, which is fear. You were denying him that power.Mohsen Mahdawi  That’s exactly right. Nobody can take away from me the power of love that I have for the world or my ability to envision and imagine a better future, or my voice that I have to share with the world. The message was not only to President Trump, but also it was to my fellow students and Americans, the people who feel the intimidation and fear. I wanted to tell them that nobody can actually take power away from you unless you let them. This is the big fight between love and fear, intimidation, harassment, or yearning for peace and unity and equality.David Goodman  Is there anything you’re afraid of?Mohsen Mahdawi  I wouldn’t say I’m afraid of it, but if I die tomorrow, I would be really sad of not making peace between Palestinians and Israelis and changing the reality for the children on the ground, to change the direction from war and bloodshed into peace and coexistence.David Goodman  Why do you believe you were targeted for deportation?Mohsen Mahdawi  They are putting me through this, treating me unjustly, restraining my freedom, threatening my existence in this country and threatening my educational journey just because I’m advocating for human rights, for the end of war and for peace. One might think it is about Palestine, but the matter now is about our humanity. Who is the next person who is going to get detained? They started with the visa holder, then I am a green card holder, then they will come to naturalized citizens, and then to the citizens. And it’s the same in Palestine, they come after the people in Gaza, now they’re going after the people in the West Bank. We must stand up against it and say no to it, divest from war, invest in peace, and strengthen international law.David Goodman  Secretary of State Rubio wrote in a memo justifying your arrest that your activism “could undermine the Middle East peace process by reinforcing antisemitic sentiment,” and when you were released from jail, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security said, “When you advocate for violence, glorify and support terrorists that relish the killing of Americans and harass Jews, that privilege should be revoked and you should not be in this country.” What is your response to those two statements?Mohsen Mahdawi  I’ve been advocating for justice and peace. I’ve been a peacemaker on campus. Yes, I’m a strong advocate for the Palestinian rights, but I have partners, mainly Jewish and Israeli partners. See the letters that have been written in my support, the protests that Israelis actually did in New York City in support of me and listen to the Jewish professors at Columbia University. They’re weaponizing the idea of antisemitism for their own purposes. They’re trying to intimidate people and to justify their unjust detention. David Goodman  What is your feeling about violent resistance? Mohsen Mahdawi  I never advocated for violence. I believe in nonviolence as the best path towards peace and justice. I believe like Gandhi believes that truth and justice have their own power. I advocate for compassion and empathy. The Jewish trauma and the Palestinian trauma are intertwined and interconnected. David Goodman  Judge Crawford in releasing you cited your ties to your community and noted that the court had received more than 90 statements and letters from community members, academic experts and professors, “many of them Jewish,” attesting to your character. What did that mean to you?Mohsen Mahdawi  I felt so grateful for all of the love and support from the Jewish community, from my professors, from many people who I didn’t know before. What matters really is the light of hope that those letters signal to Americans as a whole. It breaks it through this polarization of one side or the other, Israelis and Palestinians. The reality is we are human beings who are yearning to see a diplomatic resolution for this long bloody conflict. I joke sometimes and say I don’t think I’ve ever felt that much love and support anywhere else as much as I felt inside the cell.David Goodman  You speak of hope and love, and yet so much suffering has gone on in your life and is going on in the West Bank and in Gaza, with over 50,000 Gazans killed, some 1500 Israelis killed. What gives you this ability to stay hopeful?Mohsen Mahdawi  It is my practical experience. One of my earliest realizations in America was that if there is an enemy, it would be fear, ignorance and segregation. What people who are in power are trying to do is to tell us that we should fear the other, whether if it’s Republicans fearing Democrats, black fearing white, Palestinians fearing Israelis and vice versa. When we come together, we realize we are way more than what divides us. Actually our difference enriches our existence. We just have to break through fear,  with empathy, understanding, through feeling each other’s pain.David Goodman  Vermont may be the first place in America where judges freed people in immigration custody, freeing you and Tufts student Rumeysa Ozturk. Mohsen Mahdawi  Vermont is the place in America that is becoming the beating heart of hope and life. It signals to Americans all 50 states that the system of democracy is still functioning. It is and communicating to everybody don’t give up, because we have a justice system that holds the system with checks and balances.David Goodman  What do you hope to do after you’re finished with your education?Mohsen Mahdawi  My purpose in life is to make peace. There is no peace without justice, so to figure out a method with restorative justice, to see children living in a peaceful future and equality. This is what I dedicated my life for. This is why I went back to school. I see myself as a peacemaker, as a diplomat. David Goodman  What is your message to other immigrants who are afraid right now?Mohsen Mahdawi  You’re not alone. There are many other people who are like you, feeling afraid from the direction that politics is going in this country. In every situation of darkness, there is always light. Don’t be intimidated by the fear but try to understand it and channel it in a beautiful, creative way. I choose to see the good people in this country who are working tirelessly to change the situation. Vermont has showed up in an unbelievable, beautiful, inspiring way, and it is paving away for the rest of the country what it means to have a community that is supportive and empathetic and kind and welcoming.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont Conversation: A walk in the woods with Mohsen Mahdawi.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Mohsen-Mahdawi-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-05-14 17:07:24.528783

(Amelia Ferrell Knisely | Courtesy photo)West Virginia Watch reporter Amelia Ferrell Knisely has placed second in the Dan Rather Medals for News and Guts competition.
Knisely won for her reporting for West Virginia Watch, which “fought for transparency in West Virginia’s overwhelmed foster care system.”
For six months, Knisely requested from the West Virginia Department of Human Services documents that show how much the state spent on housing foster children in hotels in 2023. Instead of financial documents, the department sent Knisely a mostly redacted report on children staying in hotels, motels, offices and hospitals between January and October 2023. With that report, she wrote her award-winning article, “WV agency won’t release docs showing where money was spent putting foster kids in hotels.”
“The level of neglect exposed by this reporting is reprehensible,” one of the judges wrote. “The amount of work it took to get the information, public information, to shed light on this was incredible.” And in the email informing Knisely of her win, John Bridges, a lecturer in journalism at the University of Texas at Austin, where the awards are housed, wrote: “Indeed, your work was just the kind of dogged reporting that Dan Rather had in mind when he created these awards with the University of Texas.”
Knisely original records request was denied, former Gov. Jim Justice’s office did not respond to her emails and a then DoHS spokesperson denied her interview request with state child welfare leaders.
“Despite their intimidation, insults and ongoing resistance to answering my questions, I persist and have a great newsroom behind me.” Knisely told the Dan Rather Medals for News and Guts. “I’m still covering foster care and will continue to do so. These children deserve it.” 
Knisely joined West Virginia Watch when the outlet launched in July 2023. She has been covering West Virginia’s foster care system since 2019. Over the years, she’s spoken with foster children abused in out-of-state facilities, child protective services workers who can’t keep up with caseloads, biological parents who want answers and foster parents who feel lost in a complex system. She’s written about state leaders’ attempts — or lack thereof — to fix the problems, and spotlighted organizations helping vulnerable children.

(Photo by Evgeniia Siiankovskaia/Getty Images)Even now, amid all of this, I believe people generally have good intentions.
I can see the power grabs and veiled malevolence that have always been there, rising through the years with different faces and forms, but the perception of a broader shift toward darkness seems to be based on a couple of behavioral factors: Just about everybody wishes themself well, but the desire to extend that wish to others varies greatly; and just about everybody is afraid, but not of the same things.
When our politics are heavily reliant on exploiting those two factors, as now, anger and insecurity are inevitable. And with widespread anger and insecurity comes volatility. 
In New Hampshire, the debate over public education helps tell this story.
If as a society we could extract politics and taxation from the idea of public education, to be pro or anti public school teacher would make as much sense as being pro or anti breathing. Learning opportunities offered to all and equally, in thriving local schools, would serve as the mic drop for why community is preferable to isolation.
Food, shelter, and three big public offerings: safety, health care, and education. That’s what you need to stake a claim on the outskirts of Utopia. But like a bunch of self-sabotaging klutzes, we keep kicking each one out of reach every time we bend down with grasping hands. Corporate greed is largely to blame, but as voters and consumers we consistently sanction that greed.
So, when we reapply politics and taxation to the equation, that’s when the wheels come off for New Hampshire.
The state is too reliant on property taxes to pay for public education, which translates into one of the highest effective property tax rates in the nation. Meanwhile, there is a complete lack of political will to even discuss more progressive taxation to ease property-tax burdens. What would it look like to have an income tax that exists purely, and via constitutional amendment, to fund public education without that money ever being dropped into the general fund abyss? Who knows, because the conversation is shut down before it starts.
“Why don’t you move to Massachusetts, you damned socialists!” End of talk.
With this conscious aversion, New Hampshire has not only accepted its property-tax fate but embraced it. The result is such intense pressure on property-tax payers, and without any real avenues for remediation, that public schools have become twice victimized. Once through a broken and unfair funding system, and again through the misplaced anger of the tax-burdened public they serve.
The Republican solution is a multipronged effort to break apart public schools as we know them through policies such as universal school vouchers and open enrollment. I’m sure many in the GOP earnestly see these linked efforts as the best option available, with any and all tax solutions purposely off the table, but the result is like covering up structural flaws with a coat of paint. It may look fine on the outside, but it doesn’t pass inspection.
Vouchers, for example, are clearly not going to public school students seeking more desirable educational opportunities, as pitched. About 80% of the students tapping the state’s “education freedom accounts” program were not public school students to begin with but are home schooled or already attending private, often Christian, schools. So, far from easing the burden on taxpayers, the voucher program makes things worse by siphoning tens of millions of dollars away from the same schools that residents are struggling to pay for.
Open enrollment efforts, meanwhile, sound the death knell for those same local schools that on another timeline would be celebrated as the community triumph and treasure that they are. Why, I wonder, would we ever want to create winners and losers among public schools that exist to educate all and equally?
Any divide between residents and their community schools is artificial and political in nature. Property taxes are too high, and people can’t afford them. Rather than acknowledging the brokenness of that system, too many lawmakers and the monied interests behind them have worked to redirect the resulting anger toward the very people who, in various school district capacities, have dedicated their lives to helping assure better futures for our kids. They are wasting your hard-earned money on their failed schools, the conditioned pitchfork mob shouts, and even worse they are indoctrinating your kids with all kinds of wokeness. Art, music, and foreign languages? Those are luxuries we can’t afford, the mob yells, because Seurat, Saint-Saëns, and Spanish won’t do squat for the earning potential of our offspring. 
What does society really gain, they ask rhetorically, when children are exposed to the full potential of the human experience? 
All of those arguments suggest your property taxes are unbearably high for one of two reasons: New Hampshire kids have had it too good for too long, or schools are misappropriating your tax dollars. The truth is something else: We have forgotten that public education isn’t something that was forced upon us; it is something that we, in our collective wisdom, chose to build.
All because we wished ourselves well, and had grown to understand that knowledge is how you become less afraid.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/childartwork-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-14 17:07:24.528783

The agreement is for 130 of the 787 Dreamliners made in Charleston County and 30 of the 777 planes built in Washington state, with an option for an additional 50 planes of some combination of the two, according to a Boeing news release.
The order breaks three records for Boeing, the company said: It is the largest ever for its “widebody jets,” generally meaning jets with two aisles that can carry lots of passengers on long flights. It is the largest for the 787 Dreamliners made in North Charleston. And it is Qatar Airways’ largest-ever order.
“A major victory for Boeing, North Charleston, and all of South Carolina,” Gov. Henry McMaster wrote on X. “Thank you to President Trump for making this investment possible and for continuing to put American manufacturing first.”
Boeing employs about 8,200 people in South Carolina, most of them in Charleston County.
“We are deeply honored that Qatar Airways has placed this record-breaking order with Boeing, one that solidifies their future fleet with our market-leading widebody airplane family at its center,” Stephanie Pope, president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said in the release.
The purchase will make Qatar Airways the largest operator of 787 Dreamliners in the Middle East.
The airline already operates more than 150 Boeing airplanes, including 777 and 787 passenger jets and 777 Freighters, according to Boeing.
Since 2014, Qatar Airways has ordered 94 777X planes and 30 Dreamliners, according to data from Boeing.
The aircraft will be powered by American-made engines from GE Aerospace.
Producing and delivering the planes will support 154,000 domestic jobs annually and more than a million positions over the course of production, according to the White House.
Deals like the Boeing agreement will help “drive innovation and prosperity for generations, bolster American manufacturing and technological leadership, and put America on the path to a new Golden Age,” the White House said.
The company’s CEO Kelley Ortberg joined President Donald Trump and other officials in Doha for the announcement.
U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham emphasized that this was Boeing’s largest ever widebody and 787 order, dubbing the deal a “game changer” for the company and South Carolina.
“Qatar Airways’ purchase will ensure the Charleston plant has work for many years to come and it is a validation of the work product coming from the Charleston Boeing facility,” Graham said in a statement. “The Boeing workforce in South Carolina has a lot to be proud of – they consistently work hard and provide great airplanes.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/787-Dreamliner-family_2025-1024x524.jpg,,,2025-05-14 17:07:24.528783

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)First Lady Casey DeSantis on Wednesday denounced the criticism about her Hope Florida charity program in her harshest terms to date, while maintaining that she remains open about a potential run next year to succeed her husband in office.
The DeSantises appeared at a Brandon church in eastern Hillsborough County to host a roundtable discussion about the virtues of Hope Florida, the social services initiative led by the First Lady that aims to help Floridians in need.
The program itself has come under fire following reports last month from the Tampa Bay Times/Miami Herald that the Hope Florida Foundation last year quietly and quickly moved a $10 million “donation” from a settlement with a health care company that the state contracts with to two nonprofit political committees that did not have to list their donors.
Those political committees then sent $8.5 million to Keep Florida Clean, the main group opposing the constitutional amendment that would have legalized recreational cannabis in Florida — an initiative that Gov. DeSantis opposed.
Claiming that Hope Florida represents one of the “only meaningful reforms” to the welfare state since President Lyndon Johnson’s “Great Society” programs from the late 1960s, Ms. DeSantis said it was “really disheartening and very sad, but not surprising, to see these slanderous false accusations hurled at Hope Florida in an attempt to undermine all of the meaningful progress that we’ve had on so many families across the state of Florida.”
“We are not going to be dissuaded by the critics who have been captivated by willful ignorance, and we will not allow any politics to drown out the voices of families who have told us over and over for the first time that they feel a sense of hope. Hope Florida is not a program,” she said. “Hope Florida is a movement.”
The governor and his wife have held multiple press events over the past two months defending the program and assailing Florida House Republicans and news reporters who have investigated it as having a political agenda.
The House Committee investigating the allegations ended its work nearly three weeks ago and, unless the federal government intervenes, the controversy may be over for the time being.
But those news reports have done nothing to boost a potential run for governor for Casey DeSantis in 2026. That’s led to questions about how serious she actually is about entering the race. A report published earlier on Wednesday in the Miami Herald speculated that the odds of her pulling the trigger are diminishing by the day.
‘The GOAT’
With Southwest Florida U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds already on the campaign trail and raising considerable money through his main political committee, a Phoenix reporter asked her on Wednesday where she stood on a possible gubernatorial candidacy for 2026?
“I get why this is a big conversation,” she acknowledged. “But I can also say it’s more than a year away from qualifying. I mean, I think we need to be thinking about what people put people in office to do, to try to make sure that they’re delivering on the promises that they told the people that they were going to do when they first got elected.”
She labeled Ron DeSantis “The GOAT” (Greatest of all Time),  adding that whomever “he ultimately decides who should be following up after him should be somebody I think was obviously there for the people of the state of Florida.”
That person “should be in the mold of a DeSantis who’s willing to get out there and fight,” Ms. DeSantis said, eliciting a huge response from the approximately 100 people who’d gathered at the ARISE Church.
The First Lady’s comments bolster the notion that the governor is seeking a candidate he can fully back next year to maintain his legacy — someone other than Donalds, who has already been endorsed by President Donald Trump.
Other potential candidates, like former Attorney General Ashley Moody and former Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nuñez, have now moved into other positions and taken themselves out of the running — DeSantis appointed Moody to replace Marco Rubio in the U.S. Senate and Nuñez is interim president at Florida International University, soon perhaps to be president in full.
Fresh reports
The Miami Herald published a story earlier on Wednesday quoting Republican consultants (not all by name) who speculated that the combination of negative publicity around Hope Florida and Donalds’ Trump-backed candidacy was making it less likely that Ms. DeSantis will run to succeed her husband.
But Ron DeSantis blasted the story, asserting that the Herald had been “concocting hoaxes” when it came to reporting about his administration during the Covid crisis, “and so I’m very skeptical of discredited outlets in terms of what they do.”
A recent public opinion survey of Republican voters initially showed Casey DeSantis in a virtual tie with Donalds in the race for the Florida GOP nomination. However, after the voters polled were informed that Trump had endorsed Donalds, he took the lead over Mrs. DeSantis by 19 percentage points.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-14 20:04:57+00:00,CT Mirror,CT House passes bill to regulate social media use for kids,Ginny Monk,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/14/ct-social-media-bill-kids-online-safety/,"Following what some called a lack of federal action, the CT House passed a bill to restrict the use of social media algorithms on children.","In what Connecticut legislative leadership called the absence of meaningful action from Congress, the state’s House of Representatives on Wednesday passed a bill to restrict the use of social media algorithms on children.
House Bill 6857 would require social media sites that use personalized algorithms to suggest content to determine whether the user is a minor, and if they are a minor to get consent from the child’s guardian. 
It also limits notifications on suggested content on social media sites to one hour a day and bans them outside the hours of 8 a.m. to 9 p.m., unless the minor has parental consent for more notifications. 
These types of algorithms are common with platforms such as TikTok and Instagram. They work by gathering data about the user, then suggesting particular content to them. For example, if a user shows an interest in cats, the algorithm will show them more videos of cats. Part of the concern about algorithms stems from fear that teenagers particularly may seek out content about eating disorders or suicidal tendencies, then be fed content that encourages those thoughts.
Speaker of the House Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said the bills would likely draw lawsuits if passed, but that something had to be done to protect Connecticut’s children. 
“I think people are sick of saying ‘We can’t,’ and throwing their hands up. I think they’re saying you’ve got to put pen to paper and do try to do something, because there have been severe problems with bullying and all types of stuff on social media, or wrong feeds or inappropriate feeds, and they’re trying to better verify age for the content that people see,” Ritter said during a morning press briefing.
The bill passed with bipartisan support, although Republicans were concerned about how it would be enforced. There have also been other groups nationwide, including some liberal groups, that have said some teenagers who may not get support at home find community online, and access to that community shouldn’t be restricted.
Gov. Ned Lamont on Wednesday said he supports the bill.
“I think when it comes to protecting kids, making sure the parents have control over those under the age of 18, for example, making sure you have the age verification makes pretty good sense,” Lamont said. “Obviously some of the big social media companies are bringing lawsuits against a couple of states that have tried to do this, but I think it’s a step in the right direction.”
Kids’ online safety has been a signature issue for U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., who proposed the Kids Online Safety Act to ask social media companies to prioritize kids’ well-being and regulate the addictive nature of some sites.
The bill passed the Senate during the last session but stalled in the House. On Wednesday, Blumenthal reintroduced the measure.
The Connecticut bill has vague language around how social media platforms should determine whether someone is a minor. It says the platforms should use “commercially reasonable and technically feasible methods,” to figure out users’ ages.
General Law Committee vice-chair Rep. Gary Turco, D-Newington, said the bill aims to protect children and offer basic regulation around social media. It leans on parental consent for use of social media.
The goal, in part, is to encourage families to have more conversations about social media use, Democrats said.
“As somebody with three teenagers, it’s hard to be in all three bedrooms at the same time wondering if they’re looking at their phone or not,” said House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford. “So it becomes a question of, are there some basic regulations that can be put in place to help parents navigate what is a very challenging situation?”
House Minority Leader Rep. Vincent Candelora, R-North Branford, questioned why Democrats would want to regulate kids’ access to social media but not library books, although the bill would regulate notifications and algorithms that push content rather than books children choose from the library shelves.

He’s concerned about pornography in libraries, he said. Librarians across the state have argued against restrictions on what books are available in libraries.
“Whether it’s pushed or it’s accessible to children, we need to make sure that children have the right access to materials, age appropriate information, and so this social media bill strikes at that, and I think our library should do the same,” Candelora said.
The bill would be enforced by the state’s attorney general and originates from Attorney General William Tong’s office. The office would be able to investigate complaints and sue companies over violations. It would also get regular reports about social media use in Connecticut from the companies.
Christopher Gilrein, executive director of the northeast region for TechNet, an organization that represents businesses in the innovation sector, submitted public testimony opposing the bill. He said the algorithm is integral to the experience of many platforms.
“HB 6857 is built on the assumption that an algorithmically curated feed is inherently harmful and contains a subjective definition of ‘Addictive feed,’” Gilrein said in public testimony. “An algorithmic feed boosts user engagement precisely because it shows users information and posts that are most relevant to them; posts from their friends, family, and interests are prioritized.”
Republicans said Wednesday they feared the bill would violate free speech rights and would be difficult to enforce.
“I find this bill to be unconstitutional, an infringement on rights,” said Rep. Gale Mastrofrancesco, R-Wolcott. “I don’t understand why this body seems to think they can co-parent.”

“The EPA has the fundamental role of creating and enforcing safeguards for our water. Today’s action by the Trump EPA does just the opposite,” Sandy Wynn-Stelt, co-chair of the Great Lakes PFAS Action Network said in a statement. “Drinking water contaminated with toxic PFAS chemicals is linked to numerous health impacts and threatens the health of communities in Michigan and beyond. We are calling on members of Congress to do everything they can to oppose these rollbacks and protect our drinking water from toxic PFAS contamination.”
In April 2024, the EPA finalized drinking water standards, creating legally enforceable maximum contaminant levels for multiple types of PFAS — also known as perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances — and setting hazard index contaminant levels for mixtures containing two or more of the following substances: PFHxS, PFNA, HGPO-DA or PFBS.
Under these regulations, public water systems were required to adopt PFAS monitoring and compliance practices by 2027, and implement solutions to reduce PFAS levels above the maximum contaminant levels by 2029 or face penalties for violations.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
However, the EPA on Wednesday said that it would rescind the maximum contaminant levels for three types of PFAS: PFHxS, PFNA and HFPO-DA which is commonly known as GenX. It would also eliminate the hazard index levels for the named PFAS mixtures.
While the EPA will maintain the 4 parts per-trillion limit for PFOS and PFOA, the agency plans to extend the compliance deadline from 2029 to 2031. 
PFAS are often called forever chemicals, as the substances break down very slowly. They have been tied to several health issues including increased risk for prostate, kidney and testicular cancers, harms to the immune system, decreased fertility, high blood pressure in pregnant women and developmental delays or effects on children.
While Michigan has its own PFAS regulations, the EPA’s rules created a stricter standard than what was required by the state, with the Great Lakes PFAS Action Network warning the decision would have devastating effects on Michigan communities, especially those already facing PFAS contamination.
Members of the National Wildlife Federation, a member of the coalition, further criticized the decision for its impact on wildlife, arguing the decision ignores evidence of the harms these chemicals bring. 
“The science is clear: Toxic forever chemicals are dangerous for people and wildlife alike — rescinding recent, historic standards makes no sense,” Rebecca Meuninck, Great Lakes Regional Executive Director for the National Wildlife Federation said in a statement. “The EPA is ignoring strong science that shows these chemicals harm people, wildlife, and the environment. Delaying action on any PFAS only allows further contamination of our waters and wildlife.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GettyImages-10171059-1024x746.jpg,,,2025-05-14 16:10:41.002662

(Photo courtesy USAO)U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) on Wednesday sent a letter to the United States Department of Defense, asking leaders for information on how  they are operating a newly designated military zone along New Mexico’s border with Mexico and whom they might be arresting within it.
Last month, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and others touted the creation of a National Defense Area along New Mexico’s 170-mile border with Mexico. The new designation meant that land under Interior Department control effectively became part of a military base in Arizona and made trespass there a criminal offense punishable by up to a year in jail and a $100,000 fine. 
According to a Source New Mexico analysis, the newly designated military base covers an area of 400 square miles, though Defense officials say the new criminal penalties do not apply to the state and private land within that area.
Still, Heinrich and groups including the American Civil Liberties Union have raised concerns about the new zone and whether it will have unintended consequences for American citizens or the state of New Mexico. Some New Mexico State Land Office land is within the 400-mile area. The end of the 3,100-mile Continental Divide Trail is also within the National Defense Area, Heinrich noted.
“I have deep concerns that the Trump Administration is bypassing due process for individuals who either intentionally or unintentionally enter this newly restricted area, including United States citizens who may be stopped and detained by U.S. Army soldiers for trespassing on an unmarked military base,” Heinrich wrote to Secretary Hegseth.
Defense officials have said the new military zone allows it to use more resources and crack down harder on illegal border crossings. Several hundred people have faced new criminal charges so far since late April, according to federal court records.
However, United States Attorney for New Mexico Ryan Ellison has had to defend the new process in court in response to a judge’s concerns over whether people being arrested had adequate warning that they could face criminal charges, among other legal considerations. 

Read Heinrich’s letter here

Heinrich’s letter included a dozen questions about practical and legal considerations about the new zone, though he said he understands the Defense Department’s “states interest in reducing migrant crossings at the border.” 
Some of Heinrich’s questions include: 

“Can the New Mexico State Land Office access state land within the NDA? Can lease or permit holders on state land within the NDA continue to utilize those state trust lands pursuant to those leases or permits?”
“How many mining claims are within the boundary of the NDA?”
“It has been reported that at least 300 individuals have been detained within the NDA area since the designation. How many of these individuals were U.S. citizens or were legally present in the United States?”
“Does the NDA limit road access to any private property within the boundaries of the NDA? If so, how is the department providing access to those private property owners?”

Heinrich ends the letter noting that the residents of southern New Mexico have “longstanding relationships with these lands.” 
“As such, decisions that significantly alter their access or legal standing must be made transparently and with meaningful consultation. Further, it is of upmost importance that federal laws and the Constitution are upheld,” Heinrich wrote.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image001-e1746120014744-1024x1003.jpg,,,2025-05-14 16:10:41.002662

(Mariah Freschi)This article first appeared on KFF Health News.
For nearly three agonizing years, Mariah Freschi and her husband have been trying to have a second baby. The California mother recently underwent surgery to remove her blocked fallopian tubes, leaving in vitro fertilization as her only option to get pregnant. But the cost quoted by her Sacramento-area clinic was $25,000 — out of reach for Freschi, a preschool teacher, and her husband, a warehouse worker.
“When we first found out IVF was our only option, it just felt so overwhelming,” said Freschi, who has insurance through the California marketplace. “No one sets aside 20, 30 grand to grow your family.”
The Freschis are far from alone in requiring medical assistance to have children: About 13% of women and 11% of men in the U.S. experience infertility, while others are in a same-sex relationship, single or want to preserve their eggs or sperm before undergoing various medical treatments.
And, like the Freschis, many Americans do not have health insurance that pays for IVF.
During his campaign, President Donald Trump vowed that the government would cover IVF or require insurers to cover it. In February, he signed an executive order seeking policy recommendations on expanding IVF access, dubbing himself the “fertilization president” a few weeks later.
Whether the administration’s efforts will change policy remains unknown, but state-level attempts to mandate fertility coverage reveal the gauntlet of budgetary and political hurdles that such initiatives face — obstacles that have led to millions of people being left out.
“There are economic opponents, and there are ideological opponents,” said Sean Tipton, a lobbyist for the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. “It is a tough lineup of opponents. And that’s very consistent from state to state.”
Twenty-two states have passed legislation requiring insurers to cover at least some fertility care, and 15 of those require coverage for IVF. The laws vary widely, though, when it comes to who and what gets covered, largely because of debates over cost. Fertility services can range from diagnostic testing and ovulation-enhancing drugs to IVF, widely considered the most effective but also the most expensive treatment, during which one or more lab-fertilized eggs are transferred to a uterus.
It’s mostly those footing the bill amid rising health care costs and state deficits that have voiced opposition. State insurance mandates “factor in significantly” when it comes to whether employers continue to provide coverage at all because of financial concerns, according to Chris Bond, a spokesperson for AHIP, which represents health insurers, who also said employers “want to have flexibility with how these benefits are structured.”
States cite concerns about higher premiums and the budget impact of having to cover government workers. In the past few years, infertility coverage bills in Minnesota, North Dakota and Louisiana, for example, failed largely over cost.
IVF advocates, however, cite data from a decade ago showing that fertility care in states with mandates has accounted for less than 1% of total premium costs, a figure similar to estimates for newer mandates. And advocates often argue that building a family is a human right, though fertility care is disproportionately used by wealthy, white women. Covering IVF for the Medicaid population, which includes more than 70 million Americans, rarely works its way into legislative proposals.
The California example
California is a case study in how many of these conversations play out. Cost concerns sank IVF legislation in the state for several years before lawmakers approved a mandate last year. SB 729 goes into effect July 1 and requires large employers with state-regulated health insurance to cover infertility diagnosis and treatment, including IVF. State employees will get coverage in 2027.
Few states cover fertility treatment for same-sex couples, but that could be changing

California’s mandate is considered one of the most comprehensive and inclusive in the country, said Barbara Collura, president of Resolve: The National Infertility Association, making same-sex couples and single parents eligible for coverage. But it still leaves out most of the state’s insured population, including those covered by Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act marketplace and self-insured companies, which account for the majority of workers and are federally regulated.
Mimi Demissew, executive director of Our Family Coalition, an LGBTQ+ rights nonprofit that co-sponsored SB 729, said her group envisioned the broadest possible mandate, which would have included people covered by small employers, the marketplace and other privately purchased plans. “We dreamed big,” she said. “But the pushback and the whittling down was because of the budget.”
Gov. Gavin Newsom’s finance department opposed SB 729 over concerns about the state’s budget and higher premiums. And groups representing the state’s health plans and employers cited costs in their opposition, with the California Chamber of Commerce calling health care “one of the most formidable expenses a business experiences,” per a legislative analysis.
The law going into effect this year is estimated to cover around 9 million people, 5 million fewer than originally proposed. Annual premiums, whose cost is typically shared by employers and employees, are projected to increase for people with state-regulated health insurance by approximately $40 per person covered in the first year.
Mandates vary widely by state
More than 10 states — including California — have what fertility experts call “comprehensive” coverage, which requires some insurers to cover IVF with minimal restrictions. But even in those states, large swaths of the population miss out.
In Massachusetts, which has one of the country’s oldest, broadest mandates for infertility coverage, including IVF, only about 30% of women were eligible as of 2019.
Those covered by these mandates, however, are grateful. Luisa Lopez, a nonprofit executive, credited the three IVF cycles that New York’s mandate covered with allowing her and her husband to have a baby after 10 years of trying.
“I feel very lucky to live in a state that prioritized this,” Lopez said. Still, she said, she was on the hook for thousands of dollars in copays and other costs.
In states with narrow mandates, coverage is elusive. With limited exceptions, only state employees have qualified for IVF coverage through Utah’s mandate, for example. Joseph Letourneau, a University of Utah fertility specialist who successfully lobbied for fertility preservation coverage for Medicaid patients and state employees with cancer, said he couldn’t recall ideological opposition to fertility coverage but that some legislators were concerned about raising costs.
Oklahoma and Kentucky limit coverage requirements to patients who wish to preserve their fertility because of specific medical conditions.
Pushback beyond costs
Some opponents of IVF coverage say life begins at the moment of conception and have expressed concerns about the disposal of embryos during the IVF process.
Potential threats to IVF push political novices into election-year advocacy

Chieko Noguchi, a spokesperson for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, said the Catholic Church teaches that IVF is morally wrong because it “involves the death or freezing of embryonic children and treats human beings like products that can be bought and ordered.”
In Republican-controlled-Georgia, some advocates say the proposal of abortion restrictions has distracted from efforts to mandate fertility coverage. SisterSong, a reproductive justice nonprofit, supports two bills that would require private insurers and Medicaid to cover IVF in Georgia. But, the organization’s director of maternal health and birth equity initiatives, Leah Jones, acknowledged a steep uphill battle given the costs and anti-abortion legislation that some advocates fear could criminalize IVF. Having to fight just for the legality of IVF, she said, detracts from expanding access.
“We’re always on the defense,” Jones said.
Several states, including Georgia, are weighing or have passed bills that would protect access to IVF after Alabama’s state Supreme Court ruled that embryos created through IVF should be considered children, leading to temporary suspension of those services. Zemmie Fleck, executive director of Georgia Right to Life, said the Georgia anti-abortion bill would not make IVF illegal.
This fissure in Trump’s base over protecting versus restricting or even prohibiting IVF has raised questions about how his executive order will play out. Letourneau of Utah said some of his patients have asked if the order will cover their treatment costs.
The White House did not respond to requests for comment.
An uncertain road ahead
While a growing number of companies provide IVF coverage as a health benefit, most patients are left to find ways to pay on their own. Some have turned to loans — IVF financing startups such as Gaia and Future Family have raised millions in venture funding.
The Freschis have applied for grants, are crowdfunding, and have put their upcoming cycle on a credit card.
“It’s so scary,” said Freschi, describing worries about potential unexpected IVF costs. “It just feels like you’re constantly walking around with a weight on you.”

“In light of the current administration’s stated priorities on efficiency and reducing waste, we believe that maintaining the integrity of established monument boundaries supports those goals,” Nygren wrote in a letter to Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum, according to a post by the Navajo leader on X. “Changing the boundaries and reopening finalized planning processes would not only risk the loss of valuable progress but may also lead to inefficiencies, duplicative expenditures, and delays in implementing conservation strategies.”
The letter asks that no changes to the monuments’ sizes be made without a meaningful dialogue with “all tribal nations with ancestral ties to these lands.”
Poll: Utah voters, regardless of political party, support Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante

In his confirmation hearing, Burgum hinted at support for reducing the monuments and echoed Utah leaders’ criticism of use of the Antiquities Act to put protections on large areas of land. 
Bears Ears has deep spiritual and cultural importance to a number of Indigenous peoples, including the Diné, or Navajo, Nygren said in his post, noting that like neighboring Grand Staircase it is a “revered landscape.”
The monuments in southeastern Utah have been a political football for multiple presidential administrations, starting with the establishment of Grand Staircase in 1996 by President Bill Clinton who used his power under the Antiquities Act, a law passed in 1906 that gives the president authority to declare national monuments to protect areas of cultural, historical and scientific significance.
President Barack Obama then used the Antiquities Act at the end of his term in 2016 to give monument status to Bears Ears, an area tribes had long lobbied to protect.
Both monuments were scaled back by President Donald Trump when he took office in 2017, cutting Bears Ears from 1.36 million acres to 1 million acres, and Grand Staircase-Escalante from 1.35 million acres to 229,000 acres. 
In 2021, President Joe Biden restored the monuments to their original sizes, a decision Utah is challenging in court.
Meanwhile, polling indicates that 71% of voters favor maintaining Bears Ears as a national monument, while 74% support keeping Grand Staircase-Escalante as a national monument.

,New Jersey Monitor,2025-05-14 19:58:12+00:00,New Jersey Monitor,"Budget experts tell lawmakers revenue projections are up, but there’s no windfall",Nikita Biryukov,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/05/14/budget-experts-tell-lawmakers-revenue-projections-are-up-but-theres-no-windfall/,"Officials project the state will collect $57.1B in the fiscal year that begins July 1, a nominal increase from past forecasts.","Treasurer Liz Muoio told lawmakers Wednesday that the state is entering the new fiscal year ""with a solid foundation while keeping an eye on national and international economic developments."" (OIT/NJ Governor’s Office)The state’s fiscal forecasters nudged up revenue projections for the current and coming fiscal year after receiving April tax filings, but the minor shifts reflect predictions of slow growth and broad uncertainty over the future of federal funding.
Officials with the Treasury and the nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services both projected New Jersey would bring in $57.1 billion in the fiscal year that begins July 1, up from the $56.8 billion forecast by the Treasury in early April and roughly in line with the legislative office’s prior estimates. Gov. Phil Murphy’s proposed budget calls for about $58.4 billion in spending for the next fiscal year.
Treasurer Liz Muoio told the Assembly’s budget committee Wednesday that the positives of the spring filing season outweigh the negatives.
“We will enter the new fiscal year with a solid foundation while keeping an eye on national and international economic developments,” Muoio said. “As you are all aware, we continue to face massive budgetary uncertainty at the federal level.”
Revenue projections for the current fiscal year, which ends June 30, rose by similar levels. The Treasury estimates an increase from $54.9 billion to $55.3 billion, and the Office of Legislative Services’ projections increased from $55.3 billion to $55.4 billion.
The increases are too modest to significantly ease fiscal planning in a budget year officials have repeatedly called difficult, though absent later changes to state spending, they will nominally increase state reserves projected for the end of the next fiscal year from $6.3 billion to $6.7 billion.
That level of surplus would again leave New Jersey’s reserves below 12% of spending, which could spell trouble for the nascent tax relief program called Stay NJ, which promises to halve senior citizens’ property tax bills and is set to begin issuing payments in the next fiscal year. Statutory language requires a pause to Stay NJ payments if the state’s surplus dips below 12% of spending, though lawmakers can overwrite that requirement through budget language.
The Treasury has updated costs for certain health care and other programs in Murphy’s budget proposal, nudging them up by a combined $306.8 million.
The state’s deficit — the degree to which spending outpaces revenue — remains a projected $1.2 billion for the next fiscal year.
The boost to Treasury’s current-year revenue projections was attributed largely to strong personal income tax performance in April, particularly on capital gains. Officials cited a 9.9% growth rate for the gross income tax in the current fiscal year but said its growth would moderate to 2.7% in the next.
Muoio said corporate business tax collections were down 18%, year-over-year, with 60% of that decline due to businesses writing off operating losses in line with a 2023 law changing how business income is calculated for tax purposes.
Those declines should taper off in future years, but were expected to reduce collections under the state’s corporate transit fee from $867.5 million to about $814 million in the next fiscal year. Save a 6% constitutional dedication for open space, revenue from the corporate transit fee in future fiscal years is required by law to flow to NJ Transit.
Officials predicted slow growth for New Jersey’s existing revenue sources. The Office of Legislative Services’ projections say existing revenue would increase by only 1.1% in the coming fiscal year, though tax and fee increases proposed by Murphy would bring overall growth to roughly 3.4%.
“Achieving even this modest growth depends on the continued strength of the state’s consumer spending and employment, which thus far have remained resilient. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that downside risks remain,” said Oscar Mendez, revenue and economic policy analyst at the Office of Legislative Service.
Legislators, including top members on budget committees, have expressed resistance to the proposed tax hikes, which include an expansion of the sales tax to include services at recreational businesses, higher taxes on casinos’ gambling winnings, and larger surcharges on the sale of expensive homes, among other things.
“I want to make it clear to everybody who’s listening to this. There’s no desire from this Legislature to tax those services,” Sen. Paul Sarlo (D-Bergen), the Senate’s budget chair, said at an April hearing. “I think they were a talking point by the governor. I think the governor realizes those will be eliminated.”
Persistent uncertainty about the future of New Jersey’s federal funding amid broad, unpredictable shifts in federal policy left considerable flex in the state’s revenue projections.
New Jersey was set to receive $26.2 billion in federal funding for the next fiscal year, and it’s unclear how congressional Republicans’ proposal to cut more than $818 billion from Medicaid and other programs will affect New Jersey’s federal funds.
Thomas Koenig, the legislative budget and finance officer at the Office of Legislative Services, said things could turn out well, but he added, “We are concerned there is a larger than usual downside risk to our forecast.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-14 19:55:00+00:00,CT Mirror,CT Senate passes municipal camp bill following emotional debate,Laura Tillman,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/14/ct-municipal-camp-licensing-bill-debate/,The bill to require state licensure of municipal camps passed despite concerns it could unintentionally shutter low-cost child care options.,"After hours of debate, much of it emotional and personal, the Connecticut Senate passed a bill on Tuesday that would require municipal camps to be licensed by the state, despite pushback from some lawmakers who said the legislation could unintentionally shutter low-cost child care options that many parents rely on in the summer.
Sen. Jason Perillo, R-Shelton, was among the vocal critics during Tuesday’s debate of Senate Bill 6, an omnibus bill that also focuses on reporting on disconnected youth and healthy meal programs for children. He repeatedly urged his fellow senators to revisit the camp licensure requirement.
“I think we run the risk of harming these children who we attempt to affect positively,” Perillo said. “I think this may be an unintended consequence, whereby our municipal day camps are forced to close because of the costs related to implementation of the bill that is here before us.”
The bill now heads to the House.
Currently, Connecticut summer camps operate with no oversight from the state. Though many say their internal standards are high, there are no state requirements to  comply with basic safety measures like background checks, staff to camper ratios or water testing. 
Municipal camps have voiced opposition to the bill, many saying that the fine print in the bill, like a concern that Perillo raised about the ratio of people to bathrooms, would require costly infrastructure updates.
Sen. Ceci Maher, D-Wilton, co-chair of the Committee on Children, has argued that concerns about cost increases are overblown, and that leaving a loophole open that allows camps to operate without oversight has a disproportionate impact on low-income families that can’t afford private camps.
“We know that for many, many low income families, summer camps, municipal camps, are in essence child care,” Maher said. “It is an equity issue that we must oversee municipal camps to make sure they are safe and licensed at the same level as private camps are.”
Under the bill, the new provisions would take a year to go into effect. Maher said that would give the state enough time to work out cost issues that arise. 
Legislators have attempted for years to subject municipal camps to more oversight, but the issue has gotten more traction this year in light of a child sex assault case at a town-run camp in Bethany that came to public attention last year. In that case, a counselor was accused by several girls of sexual abuse at camps. But on Tuesday, Sen. Heather Somers, R-Groton, argued the new requirements would not have prevented a similar case because the counselor in that case had been subjected to a background check.
“All of these new provisions that have been put in this bill, they would not have made one difference in what happened in Bethany,” Somers said, as she pressed for an amendment that would have taken the licensure requirements out of the bill. That amendment failed. 
Sen. Catherine Osten, D-Sprague and co-chair of the Appropriations Committee, spoke on the Senate floor about the bill, saying she had “a story to tell.” Speaking at length, Osten described the struggles her family went through after her daughter was molested by a relative’s boyfriend. Osten said that went on for about a year until her daughter said something was happening.
Osten said she spent years trying to prevent other families from going through the same thing, and while she empathized with the families in Bethany that were affected by the alleged abuse, she argued that such a bill wouldn’t stop other perpetrators from hurting kids in the future. Instead, Osten said, the bill would negatively impact families because it would cause camps to shutter, leaving children without a place to go. 
“There’s nothing to take away the pain. There’s not a thing we can do to take away the pain in something like this,” Osten said. “I think it’s a great thing that you want to feel better, but I can tell you that you are not going to protect children with a piece of legislation that will not stop someone from putting hands on children. The only thing that stops people from putting hands on children is to put them in jail, to incarcerate those people, to make sure they stay there a really long time. And when they get out to follow them and make sure they get the treatment they can. And our bills today don’t address that issue.” 
Sen. Mae Flexer, D-Killingly, told her fellow lawmakers that some parts of Tuesday’s debate were frustrating. 
“I think it’s actually an example of the Connecticut legislature listening to parents,” she said. She said that parents make choices about camps based on cost, while assuming that all camps meet the same safety standards. “While what happened in Bethany is not the only reason for this legislation before us, it should be the driving reason why we finally close this loophole.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024_1001_SR_Bethany_015-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-14 17:07:24.528783

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)This story first appeared on the Rhode Island Current.
There’s no reason why money for road repairs and flood protections should hinge upon states’ cooperation with federal immigration policies, contend 20 Democratic states attorneys general.
That’s why the AGs are asking a federal judge to stop federal agencies from a “grant funding hostage scheme” that requires detaining undocumented immigrants who don’t commit crimes in order to receive key federal grants and aid.
Two new federal lawsuits filed in U.S. District Court in Rhode Island Tuesday against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) aim to protect and preserve billions of federal dollars already awarded to states for emergency preparedness, disaster relief and infrastructure projects.
Directives issued in April by DHS and DOT secretaries informed states that their federal funding required compliance with federal immigration policies. The AGs — representing Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Washington, Wisconsin and Vermont — allege this violated constitutional protections for separation of powers.
“By hanging a halt in this critical funding over States like a sword of Damocles, Defendants impose immense harm on States, forcing them to choose between readiness for disasters and emergencies, on the one hand, and their judgment about how best to investigate and prosecute crimes, on the other,” the lawsuit against DHS, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the U.S. Coast Guard, and their leaders, states.
“Defendants’ grant funding hostage scheme violates two key principles that underlie the American system of checks and balances: agencies in the Executive Branch cannot act contrary to the authority conferred on them by Congress, and the federal government cannot use the spending power to coerce States into adopting its preferred policies. Defendants have ignored both principles, claiming undelegated power to place their own conditions on dozens of grant programs that Congress created and bulldozing through the Constitution’s boundary between state and federal authority.”
The AGs say state and local public safety officials have more important work to do than cater to the whims of a new administration, which stand in contradiction to state-level directives like, for example, authorizing licenses for undocumented immigrants. Rhode Island lawmakers granted driving privileges for undocumented residents in 2022, with a July, 1 2023 effective date, joining 19 other states and D.C.
Federal protocols followed by U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other agencies could force state and local police to use state license laws as a way to find and detain undocumented immigrants.
“As a former U.S. Attorney and former federal prosecutor, I know how many ICE agents are in Rhode Island and it’s under 10,” Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha, said during a virtual news conference Tuesday. “What they need in order to carry out their agenda is for us to do the work for them, pulling us away from important law enforcement work in Rhode Island.”
No state has seen federal funding cut off since directives were issued by U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy. Not yet.
States’ abilities to respond to natural disasters and security threats, and complete key infrastructure projects, including the much-anticipated rebuild of the westbound Washington Bridge in Rhode Island, hinge upon a continued flow of congressionally authorized federal grants and aid.
The $221 million Biden-era infrastructure grant awarded to Rhode Island for the Washington Bridge project only became accessible in late March, after weeks of uncertainty in the wake of the administration change. Gov. Dan McKee’s office and the Rhode Island Department of Transportation did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment Tuesday regarding continued access to the funds in the wake of Duffy’s April 24 directive tying federal infrastructure grants to compliance with federal diversity and immigration policies.
The Duffy directive fails to provide any statutory or legal explanation for why transportation funding relates to immigration enforcement. The new requirements  jeopardize more than $628 million in federal funding in Rhode Island, and billions of dollars more across the country, the AGs argue in their lawsuit against Duffy and DOT.
“If Plaintiff States reject Defendants’ unlawful Immigration Enforcement Condition, they will collectively lose billions in federal funding that is essential to sustain critical public safety and transportation programs, including highway development, airport safety projects, protections against train collisions, and programs to prevent injuries and deaths from traffic accidents. The loss of this funding will cause state and local providers to scale back or even terminate many of these programs and projects,” the complaint states. “More cars, planes, and trains will crash, and more people will die as a result, if Defendants cut off federal funding to Plaintiff States.”


Similarly dire predictions accompany the loss of security and disaster funds, which includes $3 billion in FEMA money to states each year, according to the lawsuit against DHS. Rhode Island received more than $45 million in FEMA grants in 2024 alone, according to the lawsuit.


The new complaints reprise language of the 20 state AG lawsuits against the Trump administration that preceded them, calling the executive agencies’ actions “arbitrary and capricious” and in clear violation of constitutional separation of powers and spending clauses.
Neronha during the press conference pointed to the success that AGs have had in other lawsuits, temporarily preserving funding and policy protections for education, immigration, research funding, public health, and grants and aid to state governments, among others.
Not that he expects the frenzy of legal activity will abate anytime soon.
“As we stack wins against the Trump administration for violation of the Constitution and other federal laws, what we are seeing is a creeping authoritarianism in this country,” Neronha said. “The president is trying to take power for himself. He’s trying to sideline Congress, and now, he’s attempting to undermine the judiciary.”
Neronha likened the latest federal directives attempting to force states to redirect their own law enforcement to serve federal civil immigration policies to “holding a gun to states’ heads.”
Rhode Island, home to four of the 20 federal lawsuits against the Trump administration already, was again picked as the setting for the latest complaints due to the “strong team” within Neronha’s office, he said.
Neronha and other AGs bringing the two cases against the administration also stressed the sum of their collaborative parts.
“We’ve built the best and biggest law firm in the country, and we’re fighting for all Americans,” Neronha said.
The U.S. Department of Justice did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Tuesday.
The lawsuit against DOT was assigned to U.S. District Chief Judge John Jr. McConnell Jr., while the case against DHS was assigned to Senior District Judge William E. Smith, according to the public court docket.

“There’s no question of Rep. Bolton’s good intentions, but to say his bill was complicated is being just a little bit kind,” Clay Redden, the House public information officer, said as he read a resolution presenting the Shroud. “Representative Bolton’s bill read like chapters from a pediatrician’s anatomy book or an instruction manual and manual of how to operate a nuclear reactor.”
The bill failed a procedural motion known as a budget isolation resolution (BIR) on Feb. 27 amid pushback from both Democrats and Republicans. 
“And let’s not forget what Rep. Marcus Paramore pointed out just before the BIR failed, this bill would have made it nearly impossible for him, Rep. Leigh Hulsey and Rep. Susan DuBose to drive themselves to work,” Redden read from the resolution Wednesday.

The Raising Voices Lab is a new desk at CT Mirror that will take a different approach to meeting information needs and distributing reporting to readers. It will be spearheaded by two community engagement reporters — one based in Bridgeport and one in Hartford — who will form relationships in their cities and crowdsource questions on anything from home ownership to Medicaid to city happenings. 
The reporters will research the answers to those questions, then push that information out via text, social media and events. They will also write about what’s working in their communities, which too often only make the news when something negative happens. And they’ll bring learnings and story tips from conversations with community members back to the rest of CT Mirror’s staff to inform other reporting as well.
The goal of the Raising Voices Lab is to understand and meet the information needs of communities of color and to shine a light on stories that have historically been absent from dominant narratives about underrepresented communities.
“Making the connection between public policy and its impact on underserved communities — particularly communities of color — has long been a priority for The Connecticut Mirror, but this initiative gives us an opportunity to take that work a step further,” said CT Mirror Executive Editor Elizabeth Hamilton. “By centering the voices of residents, we hope to discover and address information gaps in these communities and provide useful tools for people to participate in solutions. We are honored to have the opportunity to work in these communities and eager to begin the listening that is at the heart of service journalism.”
CT Mirror has hired a community engagement reporter for Bridgeport and will announce the reporter serving Hartford in the coming weeks.
Bridgeport
Bridgeport native Reginald David will serve as the city’s community engagement reporter. David previously served as a producer at KCUR 89.3, Kansas City’s NPR station, where he created community-centered programming, led live event coverage for major events, and launched KC Soundcheck, a music series spotlighting local and national artists.
David has also hosted special segments, including an in-depth interview with civil rights leader Alvin Brooks and live community coverage on issues like racial segregation and neighborhood development.
A graduate of Avila University in Kansas City, he began his journalism career as an “Integrity in News” intern at WNPR in Hartford.
His first day at CT Mirror was Monday.
“We’re excited to have Reginald join CT Mirror to report on Connecticut’s largest city,” said Enterprise Editor Keila Torres Ocasio. “His knowledge of Bridgeport, coupled with his experience in community-based reporting in Kansas City, gives him a unique perspective. His goal will be to give readers in the city information that is relevant to them and readers outside the city a new reason to care about what’s happening in the Park City.”
CT Mirror’s Manager of Membership Irene Mackey chatted with David about his plans for his new role. Their conversation is below:
CT Mirror: What drew you to CT Mirror and the role of Community Engagement Reporter?
Reginald: CT Mirror’s focus on policy and accountability journalism stood out to me. I’ve found the reporting to be thoughtful and impactful. I was especially drawn to the Raising Voices Lab because I’ve always cared about uplifting underrepresented communities. This role feels like a natural next step in my work connecting stories to the people they impact.
CT Mirror: This role centers on the city of Bridgeport. How do you plan to build trust and connect with people who may not see themselves reflected in traditional media?
Reginald: I plan to show up consistently, not just when there’s a story. Whether it’s chatting at local businesses or attending events, I’ll be present, listening, and transparent about what I’m doing. I want people to see me as a neighbor, not just a reporter.
CT Mirror: Community-focused journalism often blends reporting with resource-sharing. How do you plan to decide whether a story needs to inform, explain, or guide someone to take action?
Reginald: I’ll listen to what people are asking. If there’s confusion, I’ll explain. If they’re looking for help, I’ll guide. If it’s something they’ve never heard about, I’ll inform. My goal is to make sure stories are useful and accessible.
CT Mirror: CT Mirror has a focus on state policy. How do you envision connecting local questions, like neighborhood development or access to services, to broader systems or statewide decisions?
Reginald: Most local issues are tied to bigger systems, going from housing to education. I want to show how Bridgeport residents are affected by statewide policies and focus on the connections between what’s happening in their neighborhood and what’s being decided in their city and community.
CT Mirror: Is there a local Bridgeport spot you love to visit, or something new you’re hoping to discover about the city?
Reginald: I love the beach, so being able to continue to visit all the beaches in the area is both a pleasure and a goal of mine. I’m also excited to keep exploring Bridgeport’s food spots and meet more of the people who make the city what it is.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/cropped-DavidHeadshot.jpg,,,2025-05-14 16:10:41.002662
,DC,2025-05-14 19:44:31+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"No tax on tips, child tax credit and business tax cuts survive in big House GOP bill",Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/no-tax-tips-child-tax-credit-and-business-tax-cuts-survive-big-house-gop-bill,,"WASHINGTON — House Republicans advanced the tax portion of the “one big, beautiful” reconciliation package early Wednesday, a step forward in permanently extending, and in some cases expanding, the 2017 tax law and temporarily handing President Donald Trump a win on campaign promises like no tax on tips.The House Committee on Ways and Means voted along party lines to pass the measure, 26-19, after nearly 18 hours of debate that went through the night. Republicans rejected numerous amendments offered by Democrats, including protecting tax credits meant to combat climate change enacted under Democrats’ own 2022 budget reconciliation law, the Inflation Reduction Act.The marathon debate occurred as the House Committee on Energy and Commerce debated overnight and into Wednesday afternoon over deep budget cuts, including some to Medicaid assistance for low-income individuals, to pay for the cost of tax provisions.As of now, the massive tax package is estimated to add $3.8 trillion to the budget deficit over 10 years, according to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.If any temporary expansions in the bill are eventually made permanent, it would add roughly $5.3 trillion to the deficit over the next decade, according to the CRFB. The official congressional budget score has not yet been released.Overall the bill is “a very, very big tax cut,” said Howard Gleckman, senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, part of the left-leaning Brookings Institution and Urban Institute. “Much of the benefit will go to higher income people.”Tax brackets, business breaks would continueThe bill permanently extends the underlying tax provisions passed in 2017 under the GOP-backed bill titled the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which is set to expire in 2025.This means:Individual taxpayers would remain in the same tax brackets that were lowered in 2017, and they would continue to see the doubled standard deduction — two of the most costly measures. Additionally, taxpayers will receive a boost up to $2,000 on the standard deduction through 2028.Individual brackets would remain at 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35% and 37%, though the proposal would change how inflation adjustments are calculated, meaning income would be taxed less over time, except for those in the 37% bracket.The $2,000 child tax credit, per child, would remain permanent but temporarily increase to $2,500 through 2028. The refundable portion of the credit — meaning how much money taxpayers can get back — would be increased to $1,400, but the amount remains subject to income thresholds, meaning lower income households would receive less of a refund.The child tax credit would now only be accessible if the parent submits a Social Security number, as well as a spouse’s if legally married, in addition to the already required Social Security number of each qualifying child.On the business side, the corporate tax rate would stay at 21%.Business owners who run sole proprietorships, partnerships and S-corporations would see an increase, to 23% up from 20%, in the amount of business income they can deduct from their federal returns, otherwise referred to as the pass-through income deduction.Expensing for research and development would be restored through 2029, as well as deductions available to businesses for certain investments, including equipment purchases.No tax on tips, but only for a few yearsTrump promised on the campaign trail to eliminate taxes on tips, Social Security and car loan interest. House Republicans handed him a win in their bill, but only a limited one.The bill allows individual taxpayers to deduct qualifying tips earned throughout the year, a tax break that would end in 2028. And like the new child tax credit requirement, taxpayers could only take advantage of the deduction by including a Social Security number on their federal tax return as well as their spouse’s SSN, if married.No taxes on car loan interest would also go into effect through 2028, though taxpayers could only claim it for automobiles that received final assembly in the United States.Senior citizens with incomes of $75,000 or less, or $150,000 for a married couple, would receive an extra $4,000 discount on taxable income, with the amount decreasing as incomes increase. The tax break would also expire in 2028. The bill does not specify an age for “seniors.”Highly taxed states still unhappy House Republicans raised the cap on the amount of state and local taxes, or SALT, that can be deducted, but not enough to please both GOP and Democratic lawmakers who represent highly taxed states like New York and California.Under the bill the committee advanced Wednesday morning, taxpayers could deduct up to $30,000 — three times the $10,000 ceiling in the 2017 law — from their federal taxable income. The full cap would apply to those making $400,000 or less in annual income but phases down for higher earners.Raising the cap is costly and unpopular with lawmakers representing lower tax states.Republican Reps. Mike Lawler and Nick LaLota of New York, and Rep. Young Kim of California, are threatening to vote no on the House floor if the cap isn’t raised. The House GOP cannot lose more than a handful of votes if all Republicans are present.House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana told reporters Wednesday he didn’t want to “handicap” negotiations by sharing details publicly and that he was talking to the SALT caucus until 1:30 a.m.“But I will tell you I'm absolutely confident we're going to be able to work out a compromise that everybody can live with,” he said.A ‘tragic indifference’ for poor familiesThe committee’s party-line approval of the bill drew praise and criticism across organizations representing varying interests of Americans.Kris Cox, director of federal tax policy for the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, wrote on social media that the temporary child tax credit bump does “zilch” for the roughly 17 million children whose parents do not earn enough money to receive a refund check from the credit.“But it delivers an additional $500-per-kid to higher-income families,” Cox wrote.The organization also slammed the bill for going “out of its way to take eligibility from 4.5 million US citizen kids who have at least one parent without an SSN.”Kristen Crowell, executive director of the advocacy group Fair Share America, said in a statement Wednesday that the bill “shows a tragic indifference to the very real struggles of normal, working people.“In order to save face in front of their constituents, Republicans are hiding behind misleading claims that everyone will see reductions in their taxes,” Crowell said.The Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental protection advocacy organization, estimates that phasing out and altogether eliminating clean energy tax credits would result in higher electricity bills in several states, including Ohio and Pennsylvania, according to an emailed statement.‘Unshackle the economy’ for businessesGroups representing businesses across the U.S. praised the House bill as a way to bolster investment and growth opportunities.Former Republican Ways and Means Chair Kevin Brady of Texas released a statement Wednesday on behalf of the Alliance for Competitive Taxation praising the bill as a path to “unshackle the economy from burdensome taxes and unlock new growth.”“The bill reported out by the House Ways and Means Committee is an encouraging step in that direction and, if implemented with its major pro-growth proposals intact, will help American businesses and workers compete at home and abroad,” Brady said.The alliance hailed the extension of the 21% corporate tax rate and urged lawmakers to make permanent the research and development expensing, and capital investment deductions.Kristen Silverberg, president and chief operating officer of the Business Roundtable, said her organization “applauds Chairman Smith and members of the House Ways and Means Committee for advancing a comprehensive, pro-growth tax bill,” referring to GOP Rep. Jason Smith of Missouri.“Today’s vote is a critical step forward in securing a more competitive tax system for American businesses and workers,” said Silverberg, whose organization represents 200 CEOs of U.S.-based companies.",,,,2025-05-14 16:10:41.002662

(Photo by Namthip Muanthongthae/Getty Images)A bill that has passed the New Hampshire House of Representatives and is set to be voted on by the state Senate Thursday would tie the hands of anyone trying to regulate cryptocurrency mining — a move heralded by libertarians and the crypto lobby but decried by environmentalists.
When introducing the bill, Rep. Keith Ammon, a New Boston Republican and the bill’s sponsor, said it would “give confidence to the industry that we’re not going to discriminate against them because it’s happened in other states.” Ammon pointed to North Tonawanda, New York, which The Buffalo News reported in 2024 banned crypto mining for energy and noise concerns.
If enacted, House Bill 639 would forbid state agencies and local officials from regulating cryptocurrency mining. It enshrines into law a protection for people to conduct in-home cryptocurrency mining. State agencies and local officials would be unable to ban cryptocurrency mining in their city, town, or elsewhere in the state under this bill. They would be unable to place sound limits on cryptocurrency mining, though miners would have to obey other sound ordinances. They also wouldn’t be able to charge cryptocurrency miners additional money for any outsized impact they have on the electric grid. Finally, they’d be unable to prevent people from using cryptocurrency to buy or sell things.
Cryptocurrency mining is the process of generating cryptocurrencies — which are digital assets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin — using high-energy supercomputers. The computers essentially use trial and error until they’ve guessed the solution to a puzzle that unlocks the cryptocurrency from what is known as a blockchain. These virtual assets are often bought and sold for U.S. dollars or other currencies, making mining lucrative. Proponents of crypto hope it will one day be used as a regular currency, and some buyers and sellers have already adopted it as such.
“The benefit for projecting that we’re friendly to mining is that it can help incentivize future generations,” Ammon said at a recent Senate hearing. “We want to get out of this scarcity mindset that there’s only a fixed pie of so much energy to go around.” 
Ammon — who said he owns digital assets himself and is the chair of the nonprofit New Hampshire Blockchain Council — dismissed environmental concerns about cryptocurrency’s effect on the planet and electric grids.
“There’s some folks that believe Bitcoin mining is gonna raise the oceans, we’re all gonna drown, or we’re gonna boil the seas or something like that,” he said. “All this section does is prevent municipalities from discriminating against the energy use.”
Ammon said this bill is based on the work of the Commission on Cryptocurrencies and Digital Assets, which was established by former Gov. Chris Sununu to study regulations for these digital assets, as well as model legislation circulating in other states. That model legislation was created by a Mississippi-based industry group called Satoshi Action Fund. The group seeks to promote cryptocurrency nationwide and boasts on its website that its policies have been implemented in four states: Arkansas, Louisiana, Montana, and Oklahoma. The Satoshi Action Fund was also a consultant to the governor’s cryptocurrency commission.
The bill also specifies that cryptocurrency mining and other operations are not considered securities or investment contracts. This has sparked concerns among regulators, including Katie Taylor, with the state Bureau of Securities Regulation, who said in a Senate hearing, “It would prohibit the bureau’s ability to protect New Hampshire investors.”
The bill has also drawn the attention of environmentalists in New Hampshire and elsewhere.
“What this bill says is shocking,” Cathy Corkery, chapter director of the New Hampshire Sierra Club, said. “It devalues and demotes communities from being able to zone and govern the enterprises within its own borders.”
Corkery and her colleagues have several gripes with cryptocurrency mining. First, it’s loud and usually runs 24/7, which in other communities has drawn intense ire from neighbors. It’s highly energy intensive, so it causes carbon emissions and could become a strain on the electric grid. (Analysis from a Dutch doctoral student found that, as of May 2025, the electrical energy consumption of a single Bitcoin transaction is equivalent to that of an average U.S. household over 45.60 days.) And many operations use lots of water to cool down their equipment. (Another analysis from the same researcher found that an average Bitcoin transaction uses enough water to fill a small backyard swimming pool.) They’re afraid this will raise utility bills and the hot water the facilities expel will hurt wildlife.
“The reality is that this isn’t just some guy with a computer,” she said. “These are supercomputers that suck up a lot of energy.”
Corkery is concerned how this will impact climate change, the state’s electrical grid, and quiet communities unaccustomed to loud industrial noise. Most of all, she dislikes how it hinders local government oversight.
“It takes away a town’s sovereignty,” she said. “And it says you must allow this in your town.”
Corkery said she’d heard about this legislation in other states from her national partners and so “had sort of an understanding of the experiences in other communities that had accepted this bill” before it came to New Hampshire. As such, the Granite State has garnered attention from people who have been fighting Satoshi Action Fund-endorsed legislation elsewhere. 
Cyndie Roberson, a founding member of the National Coalition Against Cryptomining, called New Hampshire’s HB 639 “a boilerplate piece of legislation written by one of crypto mining’s biggest lobbying firms” and said Satoshi Action Fund “shoot(s) this legislation out shotgun approach across states.” She pointed to Arkansas, where Satoshi Action Fund was successful in enacting the policies, as “a cautionary tale.”
When Arkansas enacted the Arkansas Data Centers Act of 2023 and a slew of crypto mines came to the state, it was met by intense uproar, Little Rock Public Radio reported. In an interview with CBS News, Gladys Anderson, who lived near a cryptocurrency mine in Bono, Arkansas, described the 24/7 sound of roughly 17,000 computer fans running in the mine “like a form of military-grade torture.” In 2024, responding to the blowback, a bipartisan group of Arkansas lawmakers approved legislation to reverse the unconditional protections miners had from local government regulation. However, a federal judge ordered the state to pause that legislation because a provision of the bill bans foreign ownership of crypto mines (legislators were also worried about mines’ potential ties to China), which may violate the 14th Amendment.
“My cautionary tale to legislators in New Hampshire who feel pressured to do this, it’s a very hard bell to unring,” Roberson said. “Once they pass this and it’s a done deal, it’s very difficult to get parts of it changed or repealed once it’s in place.”
Satoshi Action Fund did not respond to the Bulletin’s request for comment and an interview.
Corkery, with the Sierra Club, called Ammon’s worries about cryptocurrency miners being discriminated against “a farce.”
“He has no examples of it being discriminated against in New Hampshire,” she said. “He characterizes this bill as a welcome sign for the cryptocurrency industry. This is not a welcome sign. This is a come-plow-through-our-state flag.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/cryptocurrency-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-14 16:10:41.002662
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-14 19:39:06+00:00,CT Mirror,Proposal seeking to punish CT companies that aid in death penalty moves forward,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/14/ct-companies-death-penalty-executions-bill/,The legislation would penalize companies that manufacture or sell drugs or devices that can be used in capital punishment.,"The legislature’s Judiciary Committee voted Monday to advance a proposal that would penalize companies that manufacture and sell drugs or devices that can be used in capital punishment. 
The legislation initially emerged in response to an episode of John Oliver’s “Last Week Tonight” in April 2024, in which Oliver said he was “pretty sure” that the Hamden-based company Absolute Standards Inc. had provided phenobarbital, a lethal injection drug used in federal executions. 
The proposal had a public hearing in February, but was never voted out of committee. Instead, its provisions were incorporated into a separate bill — dealing with importing and compounding drugs used in medically-induced abortions — which the Judiciary Committee heard Monday. 
Under the proposal, the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer Protection can refuse to issue a certificate of registration to a business that manufactures or sells items the business knows will be used to “execute a sentence of death.” The department can also suspend or revoke a registration that already exists. 
On Monday, Sen. John Kissel, R-Enfield, raised oppositions to the bill, pointing out that while capital punishment was illegal in Connecticut, it still takes place in other U.S. states. He proposed an amendment that would eliminate certain sections of the bill. 
“I, first of all, felt that that was wrong — to try to impose our position regarding the death penalty in other states by means of restricting the lawful sale of an item by a business in Connecticut,” Kissel said. 
Kissel also questioned whether the proposal might violate an interpretation of the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution, known as the Dormant Commerce Clause. He cited the 1978 case Philadelphia v. New Jersey, which ruled that the state of New Jersey could not refuse to import waste from Philadelphia because it would “discriminate” economically against imports from another state. 
Rep. Craig Fishbein, R-Wallingford, ranking member on the Judiciary Committee, agreed with Kissel, noting that the Dormant Commerce Clause prevents individual states from taking action that would interfere with trade taking place across state lines. 
“In a nutshell, the proposed legislation, should it pass, is ripe for a likely successful [legal] challenge, and it would be irresponsible for the legislature to set the state on that path,” Fishbein said in an email.
Sen. Gary Winfield, D-New Haven, said he felt the bill deserved to be debated more broadly, on the floor of the Senate, and that he feared that amending the bill “would effectively kill it” because of how little time they had left before the legislative session ends. 
Winfield told the Connecticut Mirror that he hadn’t yet looked into the case Kissel cited, but he said he believed the circumstances of the case were different. He said while he did not want to see Connecticut export lethal drugs to other states, lawmakers needed to consider whether Kissel’s concern was legitimate.  
The bill passed through the Judiciary Committee with a vote of 28-13. 
Rep. Josh Elliott, D-Hamden, one of the sponsors of the initial legislation prohibiting the manufacture of these drugs and devices, told CT Mirror on Tuesday that he felt it was important to pass the legislation this year because of the Trump administration’s support for the death penalty. 
“We can really sort of pave the way for other states to do the same thing,” Elliott said. “By limiting the market, we make it more likely that less lethal injection will happen across the U.S.”
Absolute Standards has since ceased manufacturing phenobarbital, according to a letter that company president John Criscio wrote to Connecticut lawmakers last year. 
Along with Absolute Standards, a subsidiary of the company Walter Surface Technologies, which has its U.S. headquarters in Windsor, reportedly manufactures respirator safety masks used during executions in Alabama. Elliott said he’s not aware of any other companies in Connecticut manufacturing materials used in capital punishment. 
During the February public hearing, Elliott’s bill received some opposition from disability rights advocates and the CT Catholic Public Affairs Conference, who protested that the bill penalized companies for aiding in capital punishment but not companies or individuals who provided drugs to aid in assisted suicide or euthanasia.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Matthew Mueller)Daniel Cameron, a former Republican Kentucky attorney general who is seeking election to the U.S. Senate, criticized the Kentucky Executive Branch Ethics Commission Wednesday over what he called “a bogus charge of violating state ethics law.” 
In a news release, Cameron’s campaign says the commission has charged him with an ethics violation stemming from donations collected by his 2023 campaign for governor. 
In June 2023, the AFL-CIO filed a complaint with the commission seeking an investigation of allegations that Cameron had solicited executives of Edgewater Recovery Center while his attorney general’s office was investigating the organization. 
At the time, Cameron’s gubernatorial campaign said it had refunded the donations and canceled a fundraiser Edgewater had planned to hold for Cameron after becoming aware of a possible conflict of interest.
On Wednesday, Cameron’s Senate campaign issued additional details aimed at refuting any allegation that he used his influence as AG by failing to recuse himself and his office from the Edgewater matter.
According to a 2023 report from the Daily Beast, Cameron recused himself from the Edgewater investigation two days after his office received an open records request for Cameron’s recusals.
Cameron, who lost the 2023 race to Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear, chalked up the charge to the work of a “Democrat-controlled Executive Branch Ethics Commission.” In a statement he called it “political persecution.” Cameron also shared a video on X about the charge and said the commission was “weaponizing government to attack a political opponent.”
Cameron said he’d never run “from tough fights. Not when angry mobs protested on my front lawn. And certainly not when the left tried to strip away your constitutional rights.”
“I’m going to fight this just like I’ll continue fighting for the great people of this Commonwealth. Every single day,” he continued.

(Keila Szpaller/The Daily Montanan)A federal judge on Tuesday granted a preliminary injunction preventing the federal government from revoking the visa status of two Montana State University graduate students and prohibiting the federal government from arresting, detaining or transferring either student from Montana. 
In April, four international students affiliated with the Montana University System had their visas revoked and student visitor records terminated.
Due to the possibility of immediate deportation due to the change in status, two of the students challenged the decision in federal court.
The ACLU of Montana sued on their behalf, and the Trump administration subsequently and separately reinstated them in a database that keeps those records, the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System, or SEVIS.
However, Alex Rate with the ACLU of Montana previously told the Daily Montanan continuing the lawsuit would ensure the students have ongoing assurance their status would not change again without cause. 
U.S. District Court Judge Dana L. Christensen previously granted an emergency restraining order preventing the U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement from deporting the students, and Tuesday’s 26-page ruling converts that restraining order into a preliminary injunction, reinstating their legal status for the duration of the lawsuit. 
“The court made it clear that the Trump administration cannot unilaterally circumvent the law and punish students who have followed all the rules by stripping them of their legal status, disrupting their studies, and putting them at risk of deportation,” said Akilah Deernose, Executive Director of the ACLU of Montana, in a press statement. “We are pleased that the Court granted a preliminary injunction to provide longer-term certainty and to preserve the status quo until the lawsuit is resolved. Now our clients have the assurance they need to continue their graduate studies, especially given the unpredictable actions undertaken by the Trump administration.” 
On April 25, the Department of Homeland Security reversed a policy that had resulted in the mass termination of international students’ SEVIS records, but the court found in its ruling that because defendants could not provide “any information — let alone any specific information or timelines” about the new policy, a preliminary injunction was warranted. 
“At risk of understandment, the defendants’ approach to these particular issues presents an ever-changing landscape,” according to court documents. Without more information or a guarantee of the plaintiffs’ status, “The changes wrought by defendants appear to fall squarely within the category of ‘easily abandoned or altered in the future.”
 The court’s ruling also found that the Trump administration failed to follow its own agency’s regulation in terminating the SEVIS records, saying the action was “arbitrary and capricious.” 
According to court documents, the federal government argued that the students’ records were terminated “due to their criminal history,” but neither student has been convicted of a crime. 
One student was arrested in March and charged with misdemeanor theft, but pleaded not guilty and has not been convicted of any offense. 
The other student had been arrested and charged with misdemeanor partner and/or family member assault but also pleaded not guilty and has not been convicted of any offense. 
The Department of Homeland Security cited a regulation that says criminal activity could result in termination of status as justification for their actions, but the court found that the regulation specifically states that a “conviction” for “a crime of violence for which more than one year imprisonment may be imposed [] constitutes a failure to maintain status.”
The charges against the plaintiffs don’t satisfy the criteria, the ruling states, due to one carrying a maximum sentence of less than one year of imprisonment, the other carrying no prison time, and neither plaintiff has been convicted. 
As a result of the injunction, both students have been able to return to work and school, according to the ACLU press release. 
The students — one pursuing a doctorate in electrical engineering and physics and the other a master’s degree in microbiology — are both “only a matter of months away from obtaining their advanced degrees.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_5790-1024x855.jpg,,,2025-05-14 16:10:41.002662

Critics of the bill who debated against its passage previously said the measure claws back at advancements in civil rights and inclusion. Democrats debating against the bill said they were worried the ban would bleed into other inclusion programs like Oklahoma Promise and affect access to students with disabilities. 
Supporters said that DEI discriminates against white men and merit-based outcomes. 
The ban also prevents schools from requiring people to adhere to specific viewpoints or favor a particular religion, race or sex. 
Debating in favor of her bill on May 6, Rep. Denise Crosswhite Hader, R-Piedmont, said students have been forced to take courses irrelevant to their degree because of DEI, extending the time and money spent on a degree. She did not provide an example.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A new “One Big Beautiful Bill” unveiled Wednesday will be the last train out of Nebraska’s 2025 legislative session for additional property tax relief this year.
The new amendment to Legislative Bill 170, led by State Sen. Tom Brandt of Plymouth, would inject an additional $100 million each year into property tax relief, which would come at the cost of sales taxes being added to 20 currently exempt goods and services, effective Oct. 1, and increasing nicotine-based taxes on vapes (by 30%) and cigarettes (by 72 cents), effective July 1.
Proposed targets for expanded sales taxes range from animal grooming and dating services to lobbying and chartered flights, as well as soft drinks and energy drinks.
Supporters have dubbed the LB 170 package as “One Big Beautiful Bill” in a nod to a federal spending package working its way through Congress with President Donald Trump’s support.
“It’s why I came here,” State Sen. Jana Hughes of Seward, who worked with Brandt on the package, said of property tax relief. “It’s all I heard about.”


Estimated new tax revenue under LB 170 package

$42 million — 72-cent increase on cigarette taxes, up to $1.36.
$28 million — sales taxes on 18 currently exempt “optional” goods or services.
$25 million — sales taxes on soft drinks and energy drinks.
$15 million — increasing vape taxes from 10% to 40% wholesale.



The only viable path to additional property tax relief this year requires the proposed revenue streams in LB 170, because lawmakers advanced, and will more than likely pass Thursday, budget bills leaving about $1.1 million to spend on other priorities.
That calculation includes proposed 1.5% increases to judges’ salaries each of the next two years that lawmakers have signaled they intend to pass.
Brandt said he was pleased to get through the budget “in pretty good shape” and praised the Appropriations Committee for its work. 
“Now we can go back to working on broadening Nebraska’s tax base,” Brandt said.
A similar property tax relief plan failed throughout 2024, including during the summer special session called by Gov. Jim Pillen focused on property taxes.
Opponents, including progressives and some conservatives, refused to vote for what they saw as a reliance on sales and “sin” taxes that they said would “shift” the burden onto low-income or middle-class working Nebraskans. Scaled-back proposals also failed to gain traction.
New sales taxes
Under Brandt’s proposal, sales taxes would be added to 20 goods and services, as well as to soft drinks and energy drinks, a smaller subset than he previously proposed in LB 169. Taken together, the new sales taxes would generate about $53 million each year ($25 million of which is projected to come from pop or energy drinks alone). The package would not add sales taxes to candy, as had been proposed in LB 170.

The full list of new goods or services that would be subject to the sales tax if the bill passes:

Animal grooming of pets (grooming of livestock would continue to be exempt).
Chartered flights.
Dry cleaning or other cleaning of clothing (excluding coin-operated laundromats).
Dating services.
Interior design and decorating services.
Lobbying services.
Local passenger transportation by chartered road vehicles, including limousines or similar “luxury” vehicles.
Telemarketing services.
Telefloral delivery services for out-of-state purchasers of items to be delivered in Nebraska.
Personal instruction services for dance, golf or tennis.
Sightseeing services by ground vehicles.
Swimming pool cleaning and maintenance services.
Travel agency services.
Massage therapy services (excluding medical).
Nail care services (excluding medical).
Skin care services (excluding medical).
Tattoo or body modification services (excluding medical).
Weight loss services (excluding medical).
“Soft drinks” — nonalcoholic beverages that contain natural or artificial sweeteners, excluding drinks that contain milk or milk products; soy, rice or similar milk substitutes; or greater than 50% of vegetable or fruit juice by volume.
“Energy drinks” — carbonated or noncarbonated beverages containing a stimulant such as fortified caffeine, guarana, glucuronolactone or taurine “specifically formulated to enhance energy, alertness or physical performance.”

Brandt said that when he and other lawmakers determined which items to consider adding state and local sales taxes to, at 5.5 cents for the state, plus local taxes of up to 1.5 cents, he said “optional” items were the focus. Lawmakers also tried to tread carefully, he said, on massage, nail care, skin care or tattoo/body modification services that are for medical reasons.
Increased ‘sin’ taxes
Under the amendment to LB 170, taxes on cigarettes would increase from 64 cents per 20-pack to $1.36, the same as Iowa. Estimates that Brandt provided indicate it would generate about $42 million each year.
Lawmakers would distribute about 88% of the tax to the state’s general fund. That’s a greater share than under current law, at about 77% of the tax. Revenue is currently divided among multiple cash funds, including for cancer research, outdoor recreation development and construction.

The package also includes LB 712, from Hughes, to create a uniform 40% tax on electronic nicotine delivery systems, or vapes. It’s estimated to generate about $15 million each year.
The current system, which Hughes established in 2023, taxes vapes containing 3 milliliters or more of consumable nicotine at 10% of wholesale price, or 5 cents per milliliter on smaller devices.
Also included is LB 212, from State Sen. Dave Wordekemper of Fremont, which aims to close a “loophole” on taxes on cigars, cheroots or stogies purchased online from out-of-state retailers, subjecting those to a 20% excise tax. Estimates that Brandt provided indicate it would generate about $100,000 each year.
Last train out of the station
The property tax relief push might also be paired with tweaks to the 2023-enacted income tax cuts that will drop income tax rates for corporations and anyone making more than $18,000 down to 3.99% by Jan. 1, 2027. Rather than pausing the reductions, as in Brandt’s LB 171, some senators have suggested a longer stair-step down to 3.99%, by 2029 rather than 2027.
Last month, Pillen called pausing the rate reduction a “a crazy thought.” He has vowed to keep property taxes flat and said he was “100% confident” that lawmakers would deliver property tax relief.

A separate tax relief measure at Pillen’s request, LB 303 from Hughes, advanced from the Education Committee last week but has been significantly changed. It no longer includes a highly supported provision to directly lower school property tax rates, which is an alternative to increasing property tax credits to offset school property taxes.
Instead, the measure includes only a committee to review and suggest long-term changes to how the state finances K-12 schools, with property tax relief in mind.
Property taxes in recent years have grown annually by about $285 million. Last year was a noteworthy exception, with the state taking on the property tax portion of funding community colleges. Property taxes declined by $6 million last year off of a $5.3 billion total. 
LB 170 will likely be debated Monday, multiple senators said. That discussion is expected to last eight hours.

Iowa Dental Board records indicate the board recently charged dentist Terra Hickey of Center Point with practicing in a manner that is harmful or detrimental to the public. Hickey has been an Iowa-licensed dentist since July 2000,
The board alleges Hickey, who works at Center Point Family Dentistry, at some unspecified time in the past failed to recognize tooth decay, failed to complete a thorough removal of decay, failed to properly place restorations, and failed to adequately inform patients of their diagnosis and treatment plans. The board adds that Hickey’s failure to diagnose cavities in multiple patients resulted in tooth extractions.
Board records indicate the investigation of Hickey’s practice was initiated in 2023.
The board recently agreed to resolve the case with a settlement agreement that calls for Hickey to complete a comprehensive remedial education program as well as a board-approved coarse on ethics.
In addition, Hickey’s license will be placed on probation for one year, during which a sampling of Hickey’s work will be reviewed by a dental-practice monitor. Hickey will also be required to pay $1,200 “for probation,” according to the agreement.



Board issues order in patient-death case
The Iowa Dental Board has issued a final order in a disciplinary case involving a dentist accused of contributing to the death of a patient.
An Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing database indicates the board issued the order involving dentist Jonathan Karch two weeks ago on April 30. However, board documents outlining the terms of the final order have yet to be made publicly available, and the board’s website indicates there are no public records of any disciplinary action ever taken against Karch.
Last fall, the board issued an emergency order restricting Karch’s practice after a patient who underwent a dental-implant procedure in January 2024 died. At the time, the board alleged Karch, who worked at the Dental Studio of Iowa in Johnston, did not stay in the operatory for the duration of the procedure, in violation of state regulations.
In issuing the emergency order restricting Karch’s ability to practice, the board said it recognized “(Karch) as an imminent threat to public safety” and stated that he “should not be permitted to participate in procedures involving sedation until further order.”
The emergency order was issued nine months after the alleged death and coincided with a civil lawsuit filed against Karch and others involved in the surgery. The lawsuit, filed in Polk County District Court by the family of Joseph Daniels, stated that on Jan. 26, 2024, the 50-year-old Daniels underwent a dental-implant operation that began at 7:15 a.m. and was completed at 3:15 p.m.
Around 3:30 p.m., paramedics were dispatched to Dental Studio of Iowa with a report of an “unconscious person.” According to the lawsuit, the paramedics arrived at 3:40 p.m. and found Daniels in a dental exam chair “pale, cyanotic, cool and unresponsive.” Daniels was then taken to Iowa Methodist Medical Center where he died at 5:51 p.m.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DENTAL-.jpg,,,2025-05-14 15:05:59.650705

The 3.1 million-square-foot facility, known as RIC6, will occupy a 107-acre parcel in the Rockville Opportunity Corridor. It joins a growing network of Amazon investments in Virginia that include fulfillment and delivery centers, dozens of data centers, Whole Foods Markets, Amazon Fresh stores, and the company’s second headquarters in Arlington.
“Virginia continues to be a great home for Amazon thanks to its robust infrastructure, talented workforce, and supportive business environment,” said Holly Sullivan, Amazon’s Vice President of Worldwide Economic Development and Public Policy. “We’re proud to officially break ground on our fourth robotics fulfillment center in the commonwealth, furthering our substantial investment in Virginia.”
The new center will handle the picking, packing, and shipping of smaller customer items such as books, electronics and toys. It follows similar sites in Suffolk, which opened in 2022, Henrico (2024) and a soon-to-launch facility in Virginia Beach.
In addition to job creation, the project has spurred transportation improvements. A diverging diamond interchange less than a mile from the site at Ashland Road (Route 623) was funded through the state’s SMART SCALE process and regional transportation dollars, aimed at easing traffic and boosting safety near the growing logistics hub.
“Having the right transportation infrastructure is essential to attracting and growing business,” said Secretary of Transportation Sheppard Miller. “Through our best-in-class SMART SCALE prioritization process, we were able to support this important transportation project and drive economic development.”
Gov. Glenn Youngkin praised the project as a reflection of “Virginia’s business-friendly environment and the quality of our workforce.”
Goochland County officials said the announcement is the result of more than a decade of strategic planning to attract major employers.
“We are thrilled to welcome Amazon to the Goochland business community,” said Board of Supervisors Chairman Tom Winfree. “Their decision to locate in the Rockville Opportunity Corridor has already proven to be beneficial to the region by helping to secure funding for critical transportation improvements.”
Since 2010, Amazon says it has invested more than $135 billion in Virginia, including infrastructure and employee compensation, and created more than 42,000 direct jobs. Company data estimates those investments support an additional 195,000 indirect jobs statewide and have contributed more than $96 billion to Virginia’s GDP.
“Amazon’s continued expansion in Virginia is a testament to the collaboration between state, regional and local partners who are committed to smart, strategic growth,” said Secretary of Commerce and Trade Juan Pablo Segura. “This project is the result of long-term planning in Goochland County and strong infrastructure investments by the commonwealth.”
State lawmakers from the area also hailed the announcement as a boost to regional prosperity.
Del. David Owen, R-Henrico, said the forthcoming facility “highlights the strengths of our community” and “will create substantial employment opportunities for our residents and contribute to the economic vitality of our region.” 
And State Sen. Luther Cifers, R-Prince Edward, added: “Amazon chose well, thanks to Goochland County’s incredible work over the last 15 years that have made it one of the best places in Virginia to live and work.”

Missoula County District Court Judge Jason Marks permanently enjoined SB 99, from the 2023 Legislative session, and declined to hear remaining claims from the plaintiffs in the case, Cross et al vs. State of Montana.
The lawsuit was filed by a coalition of minors and providers as well as the American Civil Liberties Union. In 2024 the Montana Supreme Court upheld an injunction against the law being put into place.
“I will never understand why my representatives worked so hard to strip me of my rights and the rights of other transgender kids,” Phoebe Cross, a 17-year-old transgender boy who was a plaintiff in the case, said in a release. “It’s great that the courts, including the Montana Supreme Court, have seen this law for what it was, discriminatory, and today have thrown it out for good. Just living as a trans teenager is difficult enough, the last thing me and my peers need is to have our rights taken away.”
Mark’s order said SB 99 was discriminatory, prevented trans people from accessing medical information and that it infringed on the plaintiffs’ right to privacy, among other issues the court found with the law.
The law would have banned the use of treatments like puberty blockers and surgeries, which are gender-affirming care. The law also would not have banned the same sort of treatment for cisgender children.
“The Montana Constitution protects the privacy and dignity of all Montanans,” Akilah Deernose, ACLU-MT Executive Director said in a release. “In the face of those protections, cruel and inhumane laws like SB 99 will always fail.  Today’s decision should be a powerful message to those that seek to marginalize and harass transgender Montanans.”
Defendants in the case also pointed to “detransitioners” as an argument to support their case that the law was protecting minors. The court said it would lead to “absurd” results.
“Under Defendants’ reasoning, the State could infringe on minors’ fundamental rights whenever any minor was protected at the expense of the majority of minors,” the order reads. “For example, the State could categorically ban all influenza vaccines for all minors in an effort to protect the small percentage of minors who experience allergic reactions to that vaccine. This line of reasoning would lead to absurd results.”
The court also said the state’s interest in the case was “political and ideological.” 
Lambda Legal, which helped bring the lawsuit, also pointed to another case it’s supporting, with the U.S. Supreme Court expected to soon rule on U.S. v. Skrmetti. That case challenges a Tennessee ban on gender-affirming hormonal therapies for transgender youth, saying the law violates the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution.
The state could appeal the decision to the Montana Supreme Court, but representatives from the AG’s office did not respond to a request for comment about the ruling.

Catherine Lang was evicted from her apartment outside Chicago after the police saw her swerving in traffic and charged her with driving drunk. A jury found her not guilty, but by then it was too late.

Dalarie Hardimon was evicted after the police chased a man speeding in her van through a residential neighborhood.

And Catherine Garcia was ordered out of the townhouse she and her sons had lived in for 20 years. Their offense? Making too many 911 calls. Most of them came from Ms. Garcia’s intellectually disabled son.

The three women lived in Illinois cities that have adopted what are known as crime-free housing laws, local ordinances that empower the police and landlords to evict tenants who are accused of breaking the law.

The laws were promoted as a way to clear out violent criminals, drug dealers and nuisance tenants who made life miserable for their neighbors. But an investigation by The New York Times and the Illinois Answers Project shows that many cities in Illinois have turned crime-free housing programs into a blunt instrument to oust families for virtually any alleged infraction, no matter how minor.

In the most comprehensive statewide review to date, the news organizations examined cases in which renters were found to have violated the ordinances in 25 Illinois towns. Reporters interviewed dozens of landlords and tenants, and gathered police records. Ultimately they found more than 2,000 enforcement incidents across the state from 2019 to 2024.

City officials ordered landlords to evict tenants in nearly 500 of those cases.

The outcomes were unclear in most of the remaining cases because none of the cities tracked what happened after they sent violation letters. Landlords can seek an eviction even when cities do not demand it.

About a third of the 2,000 violation letters cited serious crimes. Landlords were ordered to evict or take other actions against renters caught in possession of drugs or charged with violent felonies. Sometimes, there were multiple accusations and a long trail of police interactions or neighbor complaints.

But the majority of the cases fell short of that. More than 1,300 were for misdemeanors or noncriminal offenses, many of which were never pursued by prosecutors. Most cities have crafted their laws so they can evict tenants even if the renters are never convicted of a crime, or never proved to have harmed their neighbors.

City police departments have ordered landlords to evict people over commonplace charges including shoplifting and driving while intoxicated. Renters have lost their homes based on accusations that they neglected their pets, failed to keep a close watch on their children and, in one case, eavesdropped on a neighbor. In many cities, a single violation was enough to trigger an eviction.

Enforcement of the laws often appeared to have little to do with protecting people from criminal activity next door. Hundreds of the infractions occurred somewhere other than at the rental property, including at gas stations and stores, or after traffic stops that occurred miles away from a tenant’s home.

It did not matter if the person accused was the leaseholder. Entire families have been forced from their homes after a child living there was accused of a crime, or a visitor was arrested. In at least five cases, renters were flagged because they had called 911 to get help or to report a crime that had been committed against them.

Officials in more than a dozen municipalities said that their crime-free programs were fair and that the laws had led to drastic reductions in 911 calls and reports of nuisances in rental communities.

Several noted that they had modified their programs over the years, often in response to complaints from landlords and renters, to ensure that only serious infractions led to evictions.

Matthew Eiskant, the chief of police in Belleville, said entire neighborhoods in his town, just outside St. Louis, have been “revitalized” by evicting just a few people.

“Our citizens are overwhelmingly in support of crime-free housing,” Chief Eiskant said.

But many cities, including Belleville, still have ordinances that allow them to seek evictions against virtually anyone the police suspect of breaking the law. Four landlords interviewed by The Times and Illinois Answers said they had each tried to help at least one tenant fight an eviction they thought was unnecessary or unfair. Enforcement records revealed many more cases in which landlords challenged evictions in hopes of keeping good tenants.



[caption id=""attachment_66774"" align=""alignnone"" width=""1024""] Kate Walz, a lawyer in Chicago, has sought legislation that would limit or ban crime-free housing programs in Illinois. (Credit: Jamie Kelter Davis for The New York Times)[/caption]



Mary Aviles, a landlord in Midlothian, a Chicago suburb, said she had called the police when she noticed a tenant had been leaving dogs caged in the home’s garage. While concerned about the dogs, she was shocked when the police ordered her to evict the tenants without warning; she felt the offense had not endangered others.

If she did not evict her tenant, Ms. Aviles faced fines up to $750 a day or losing her license to run a rental property, common penalties in most cities.

“It completely goes against the fundamentals of our justice system,” she said.

Housing advocates have long argued that the laws are discriminatory because they disproportionately fall on low-income residents and people of color. Tenants in several states have sued and won six-figure settlements against cities, some of which were accused of evicting Black tenants based on little more than vague suspicions called into the police by neighbors.

For years, Kate Walz, a lawyer in Chicago, and other housing advocates have sought legislation that would limit or ban crime-free housing programs statewide.

The latest effort, a bill being debated in the Illinois State Senate, would create sweeping regulations for the laws and make it more difficult for people to be evicted if they have not been convicted. The bill is scheduled for a Senate committee vote this week.

Ms. Walz said that the legislation would not solve all the challenges of crime-free housing programs, but that it would help protect renters from overzealous enforcement.

“There’s no supervision. There’s no education in terms of eviction laws or fair housing laws that they need to abide by,” Ms. Walz said. “Why would you do any other kinds of law enforcement, right?”

The expansion of crime-free housing

Fear helped spread crime-free housing laws across Illinois.

In 2000, the Chicago Housing Authority began tearing down Cabrini-Green, a massive public housing complex that had been painted as a haven for crime. Elected leaders in the small cities encircling Chicago worried about where the displaced renters would move.

Officials in dozens of towns adopted the ordinances and launched training programs for landlords. Training presentations featured pictures of Cabrini-Green and slides warning that criminals would “grow like weeds” and “choke out healthy plants.”

Ms. Walz described a kind of arms race among the cities, which rushed to start programs so they would not be communities where supposed lawbreakers felt welcome.

More than 100 cities adopted the laws. One in four Illinois residents now lives in a place that compels renters to sign a lease contract that states a tenant can be evicted if accused of a crime.

Many cities require tenants to sign crime-free leases that are so broad that virtually any perceived violation could be grounds for eviction, even if the allegations are never fully investigated or proved.

In Orland Park, renters must sign a contract that says they can be evicted after a single arrest. “Proof of violation shall not require a criminal conviction,” the contract reads.

In DeKalb, a university town about an hour outside Chicago, rental contracts state that tenants can be evicted for any allegation, from a violent felony to a municipal code violation, which can include setting off fireworks or giving alcohol to a minor. The tenant is held accountable for anyone visiting the household, even if the tenant was unaware of the guest’s behavior, or unable to control it.

By 2015, enforcement in some Illinois cities had gotten so aggressive that state legislators passed a law barring city officials from evicting victims of domestic violence for calling 911. Some towns had been counting domestic assault reports at a given address and evicting everyone living there, including the victims.

Despite the reform, The Times and Illinois Answers found hundreds of instances where cities ordered tenants evicted after a domestic violence call to 911, most of them in Belleville. Mr. Eiskant said his program has never evicted a victim of domestic violence.

But advocates point out that it is often difficult for the police to determine who the aggressor is in a domestic violence case. And sometimes a person accused of abuse is the primary breadwinner, meaning that if he or she is evicted, the entire family may have to leave.

Beyond the 2015 law, there is virtually no statewide oversight of crime-free housing ordinances, leading to vast differences in how cities apply the laws.

Among the 25 cities examined by The Times and Illinois Answers, most opened fewer than 10 crime-free cases a year from 2021 to 2024, and ordered evictions about a quarter of the time. With an average of 84 cases a year, Belleville was among the most aggressive. It required an eviction in every case.

And then there is Oak Forest, a city of 26,000 people just south of Chicago, where the police pursued an average of 178 cases a year, more than double any other Illinois city over that period.

‘Just arresting people wasn’t fixing the problem’

The Manchester Court Apartments rise up from a tangle of strip malls and residential buildings that make up the second ward of Oak Forest.

Hundreds of people live in the complex, many of them blue collar workers who take the commuter train to neighboring suburbs for cleaning and industrial jobs. For years, the cluster of three-story brick buildings had a reputation for being rundown and dangerous.

During a recent visit to the complex, Jason Reid, who retired in March as the chief of police in Oak Forest, described how it once operated like an open-air drug market, with shadowy figures loitering day and night. Residents, he said, were fearful of going outside.

These days, children wait for the morning bus with their parents, and play in the parking lot after school lets out.

“You wouldn’t have seen that 15 years ago,” Mr. Reid said. “Just arresting people wasn’t fixing the problem.”

In recent years, Oak Forest police officials have sent a steady stream of letters to property managers at the complex, informing them if tenants had run-ins with the police. The letters arrived more than once a month on average from 2020 to 2024; at least six cases required an eviction.

Across the city, crime-free enforcement was even more aggressive during that period. Since 2019, the city has sent about 1,000 notification letters to landlords, enough to give one to half of the rental units in the city.

Hundreds of the notification letters were about noise complaints; 32 were about animal welfare. At least two-thirds were for misdemeanors or noncriminal violations.

Like most cities, Oak Forest did not track how many notifications prompted landlords to evict tenants. But in at least 30 cases, city officials included language demanding that a landlord evict a tenant, usually over an alleged felony, a review of the letters shows.

Housing advocates said that cities like Oak Forest, in their rush to crack down on crime, have forced people out of some of the region’s only affordable housing and put them at risk of becoming homeless.

In 2021, Oak Forest police found a man overdosing on the floor of his apartment. The next day, police department officials ordered the man’s landlord to evict him. Last year, the police told a landlord to evict a family after a teenager who lived in the home was accused of stealing cars in Chicago with his friends. And at least four families were evicted after someone in the home was caught by the police smoking marijuana.



[caption id=""attachment_66770"" align=""alignnone"" width=""1024""] To avoid eviction, Ms. Diop had to sue the city of Palatine. She discovered someone accused of a crime had falsely given her residence as her home address. (Credit: Jamie Kelter Davis/For The New York Times)[/caption]



They all had just a few weeks to move out and come up with the money to move somewhere else.

Oak Forest’s ordinance grants landlords, but not tenants, the opportunity to appeal the city’s decision to issue a crime-free housing violation. Tenants can be left in the dark because city officials send violation letters to landlords and make no effort to communicate with tenants, or explain why the tenants have been targeted for eviction.

In cities that do offer renters a chance to appeal, tenants are generally on their own to hire a lawyer. In many cities, the person ruling on appeals is the police chief or the crime-free housing officer, who would have ordered the eviction in the first place.

Gail Diop, a former resident of Palatine, a suburban community northwest of Chicago, tried for weeks to convince the police her family had not violated the city’s crime-free housing laws in 2016.

In the end, she had to hire a lawyer and sue the city. Only then did she discover why the city had sought to evict her: A friend of her teenage son had been arrested on shoplifting charges at a Walmart, and had falsely given the police their home address as his residence.

The city stopped the eviction and offered Ms. Diop $10,000 for the error.

Ms. Diop eventually left Palatine because she was concerned her son would be targeted. “How can I respect officers of the law that would do people like this?” she said.

‘I’m a nuisance, I can’t call 911’

The appeals hearings in Granite City, a steel town near St. Louis, offer a window into what residents experience when they try to fight evictions under crime-free housing laws.

Audio recordings of 22 hearings from 2018 and 2019, obtained by lawyers who were suing the city, show that most tenants who were appealing did not have a lawyer or fully understand the proceedings. Some said they did not know what they or their family members had been accused of, or what they needed to prove to avoid eviction.

The hearings during that period were overseen by Scott Griffith, a former attorney hired by Granite City, who died in 2023.

The hearings — as many as 12 a day — lasted about 10 minutes. Tenants were told, often on the spot and for the first time, that they were expected to cross-examine the police officers themselves and to offer any legal objections to evidence that the officers had entered into the record.

Reginald and Monique Harris appeared lost at the start of their hearing in 2018. Their son, who was 18 at the time, had been arrested on charges of having cannabis in his pocket. They said they didn’t know anything about the incident because he was living on his own across the state line, in St. Louis.

At one point, Mrs. Harris burst into tears as she begged the hearing officer not to uproot the entire family, including her 11-year-old daughter.

Mr. Griffith rescinded the city’s order to evict.

Less than a year later, the couple was back. Their son had been accused of banging on a McDonald’s drive-through window so hard that it broke. He had left his drink inside, but workers ignored his knocks because they had closed.

It had been more than a year since the Harris’s son lived in the home. But old documentation still tied him to the address, and the family once again faced the prospect of being evicted.

The family took time away from work to go to the hearings and gathered mail and documents to make their case.

“We’re the kind of folks you want in your neighborhood,” Mr. Harris said during an impassioned eight-minute speech at the hearing. “This is not just residency on the line for me, this is my life,” he added. The family was let off the hook.



[caption id=""attachment_66767"" align=""alignnone"" width=""1024""] Catherine Garcia was ordered out of the townhouse she had lived in for 20 years for making too many 911 calls. Most of them came from her intellectually disabled son. (Credit: Jamie Kelter Davis/For The New York Times)[/caption]



Many tenants choose not to appeal, because of the hassle or the belief that they would not win. Some cities do not provide for an administrative appeal, leaving tenants no option but to wait for a formal eviction notice and to fight it in court.

That’s the decision Catherine Garcia faced in 2023, when West Chicago officials told her she would have to move out of the modest rental she had lived in for 20 years. She moved out to avoid a formal eviction.

Ms. Garcia had raised her four boys in the townhouse. She loved the tree-lined streets and the relative quiet of being outside the big city. She said she always paid her rent on time.

But problems emerged as her sons grew up. Things came to a head in 2023, when two of the three adult sons who still lived with her began struggling with their mental health.

One son, diagnosed with a severe intellectual disability, constantly called 911 for issues like losing his mother’s phone number, or suffering a headache. Ms. Garcia said his frustrations sometimes erupted into violent fits where he would punch walls or push his family members, forcing them to call the police.

The other son had spiraled into a depression. He often threatened to end his own life, and Ms. Garcia felt she had no choice but to call 911 each time.

By the fall of 2023, officials in the West Chicago Police Department had had enough. The Garcias had called 911 more than 100 times in a year, and were labeled repeat offenders under the city’s crime-free housing law.

Ms. Garcia’s landlord gave her 10 days to move out. Her youngest son found the eviction notice posted on the door.

She could not afford the deposit on a new apartment, so she made plans to move into a hotel room across town for $700 a week. It cost twice what she had been paying for a fraction of the space, which she planned to share with three of her adult sons.

She spent days throwing out items her family had accumulated over 20 years: Christmas decorations; her sons’ youth sports jerseys; bedroom furniture her grandmother had left her; and the China cabinet, which she broke into pieces so the city could haul it away.

“I was just in depression and denial,” she said. “How could this be happening?”

The night before the Garcias were to move into the hotel, a friend offered a vacant home she owned in town. It was a financial lifeline, but the house needed work. The bathroom was unfinished and the furnace was on its way out. They spent a month sleeping on mattresses on the dining room floor.

A year later, Ms. Garcia, who works at a milk distribution company and gets financial help from her sons and their father, bought the house. She said her family was finding some balance, but there have been times when she felt she needed help and was afraid to call the police.

“I’m like, ‘oh my God, I’m a nuisance, I can’t call 911,’” she said.

(Photo by TEK IMAGE/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY via Getty Images)Both chambers of the Maine Legislature have thrown overwhelming support behind legislation that would require insurance carriers in Maine to cover medically necessary blood tests for so-called forever chemicals. 
The Senate on Tuesday unanimously passed LD 582, which would require health insurance carriers to cover blood tests for perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, also known as PFAS, when they are deemed medically necessary. The House of Representatives then voted 115-26 in support of its passage Wednesday with backing from all Democrats and many Republicans. 
The bill will go back to each chamber for enactment votes before it can be sent to Gov. Janet Mills for final approval. Because the bill will require some funding, it also needs to be included in the upcoming budget.
Thirty years ago, Rep. Paul Flynn (R-Albion) received a letter that the dairy farm next to his home would be spreading sludge on its land. At the time, he was told there was nothing to worry about. But like many Maine residents, he now lives in an area surrounded by PFAS, which are also known as forever chemicals because of their durability.
“This is something that has snuck up on us,” Flynn said on the House floor Wednesday. “It is in front of us, and it is very, very real.”
The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has identified more than 1,000 sites throughout the state that could be affected by former sludge application. The state has a robust response program that currently provides technical and financial assistance to more than 80 farms with varying levels of contamination. That work will continue thanks to legislation passed earlier this year enshrining the program into law.
But contamination isn’t just contained to the land. It can get into waterways, drinking wells and ultimately, people’s bloodstreams. Exposure to the chemicals has been linked to health concerns including cancer, liver damage, pregnancy complications, increased cholesterol levels and more. Workplace exposure is high for firefighters, chemical manufacturers and ski wax technicians while communities exposed to spills of PFAS-laden products, like the one in Brunswick last summer, also face risk.
The Environmental Protection Agency announced Wednesday it is changing the standards for certain types of PFAS in drinking water that were finalized under the Biden administration and could have lowered exposure for millions of Americans. While the federal agency is weakening the limit for some of the forever chemicals, it is maintaining others but delaying the deadline to meet the standards.
Rep. Shelley Rudnicki (R-Fairfield) said she has had her blood tested three times since her community received notification of high PFAS levels. The tests showed high levels of the forever chemicals in her body. However, she said she couldn’t support LD 582 because she doesn’t believe in mandates. 
“I’m not a fan, obviously, of the PFAS, but I’m also not a fan of the mandates, so I will be voting against this,” Rudnicki said on the House floor. 
She also raised concerns that the Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial Services Committee suggested the state use money from the PFAS Fund to help defray costs. Mills created the fund in 2022 to help address contaminated farmland and the Legislature appropriated $60 million for that use.
The committee also amended the bill to prohibit insurance carriers from imposing any cost-sharing to cover the blood tests, and pushed back the start date to apply to health plans issued or renewed after Jan. 1, 2027.

An anti-pornography organization in Washington, D.C., more recently filed four federal lawsuits in Kansas comparable to action taken by the state attorney general. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A bundle of federal lawsuits in Kansas have been filed on behalf of a 14-year-old Olathe resident alleging owners of online businesses violated a state law mandating steps be taken to prevent minors from accessing pornography lacking scientific, artistic or political value.
The law center of the National Center on Sexual Exploitation, a conservative anti-pornography organization in Washington, D.C., collaborated with a Hutchinson law firm to file suit on behalf of minor Q.R. and his mother Jane Doe against jerkmate.com, Techpump Solutions’ superporn.com, Titan Websites and chaturbate.com.
In each instance, the lawsuits allege, a company failed to comply with a state law that took effect July 1, 2024, requiring deployment of age verification systems on pornography websites to block consumers under the age of 18.
The court documents asserted Q.R. used one of his mother’s old laptops to access internet pornography from the four companies more than 170 times from August to October 2024.
“Kansas law requires pornography companies to implement reasonable age verification methods, and the companies named in these lawsuits failed to do so,” said Dani Pinter, director of the legal division of the National Center on Sexual Exploitation.
In January, Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach filed a similar lawsuit in Shawnee County District Court against Seattle-based SARJ LLC, which distributed pornography on more than a dozen websites and was purportedly owned by individuals who controlled jerkmate.com.
Kobach asserted in the state court filing that SARJ didn’t make use of age-gating technology that would “protect Kansas children from the negative health consequences that stem from unfettered access to pornography.”
The federal lawsuits filed by Joshua Ruhlmann, a Hutchinson attorney, claimed the website content accessed by Q.R. was harmful because it had a tendency to appeal to a minor’s prurient interest in sex, was offensive to prevailing standards with respect to what was suitable for minors and lacked serious literary, scientific, educational, artistic or political value for a viewer under age 18.
Specifically, one of the federal lawsuits alleged at least one-fourth of jerkmate.com’s webpages viewed during a calendar month included “material containing nudity, sexual conduct, sexual excitement and/or sadomasochistic abuse.”
That court filing said minors who visited the website were asked to click an “I AGREE” button, which ostensibly verified the user was over the age of 18. That site warned users the company’s content was restricted to consumers reached the age majority in the jurisdiction in which they resided.
“Despite expressly aiming their websites at Kansas citizens, defendants have failed to ensure that jerkmate.com and/or jerkmatelive.com comply with Kansas law which requires pornographic websites to employ age verification measures,” the suit said.
The National Center on Sexual Exploitation, previously known as Morality in Media, has lobbied against sex trafficking, same-sex marriage, decriminalization of sex work, comprehensive sex education and works of art that could be viewed as obscene.
Pinter said the family serving as plaintiffs in the organization’s lawsuits in U.S. District Court in Kansas “deserves every measure of justice.”
“It is unreasonably dangerous for these pornography websites to provide this product which they know is harmful to children, that children are drawn to access, and do access, without employing age verification as required by Kansas law,” she said.
In April 2024, Gov. Laura Kelly allowed the age-verification bill to become law without her signature. It was approved unanimously in the Senate and 92-31 by the House. Kelly said the pornography statute could “end up infringing on constitutional rights” of Kansans and inspire lawsuits against the state.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/P6170161-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-05-14 15:05:59.650705

(Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Although the solar industry has been operating in Louisiana for years, state lawmakers took their first stab at making uniform rules and regulations, only to kill the effort.
Some parishes have had to make their own rules for the installation and construction of household solar panels and larger arrays or “farms.” Local officials have asked the state to create a guidebook to guide their decisions. 
However, House Bill 615, by Rep. Brett Geymann, R-Lake Charles, failed to pass the balancing act of granting local regulatory power and giving the solar industry what it says they need to operate. It failed in a 47-52 House floor vote.
Geymann’s testimony in committee and on the House floor focused on projects across the state that did not have a local ordinance in place and have become what he called eyesores. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Driving over the Mississippi River Bridge from Baton Rouge into Port Allen, the remnants of an old solar farm – one of the first built in the state – are still visible. Rep. Jeremy LaCombe, R-Livonia, said in a House Committee on Natural Resources and Environment hearing his constituents who live nearby still have to deal with the unsightly defunct farm.   
Other projects in Franklinton, Springfield, and Monroe were scrutinized in the hearing as poorly maintained and supposedly bringing down surrounding property values.
Committee member Rep. Shane Mack, R-Livingston, recalled his time on the Livingston Parish Council, where members struggled to find a solution for a proposed solar farm. Constituents were largely concerned with having to look at the solar panels from their residential properties.
“I wish we could go back in time, and this legislation [would have been] in place. Because if it had been, I think a lot of the complaints I received then and that I still receive today probably could have been avoided,” Mack said.
“We’re not here today because everything is going great in the solar industry, because it’s not,” Geymann said.
His bill would have set requirements for the distance between any solar project and the closest residential property, keeping them a mile apart in its initial version. Industry interests said the standard would be impossible to meet. 
Geymann said he plans to bring a different version of his bill next year. He voiced frustrations around industry leaders allegedly not assisting him in giving direct solutions or amendments.
“We have worked on this for an entire year … We have sought input from people all over, and right now we believe we are in a good spot [with the bill],” Geymann said before the floor vote.
Norby Chabert, a lobbyist for the Southern Renewable Energy Association, said group members met with Geymann before the committee hearing on his bill, outlining parts that would make it extremely difficult on solar projects in Louisiana. He said he would work with Geymann to help craft next year’s proposal.
Some lawmakers struggled with the bill because it would have overtaken some local ordinances and replaced them with the new state rules. It did allow for local governments to work with solar project developers to ask the state for permission to soften some state rules, but they could not fully opt out of them.
“I just want to make sure this doesn’t supersede what is already in place and somehow lets these facilities off the hook to drop their financial assurance,” LaCombe said.
Solar projects would have had to get clearance from the Department of Energy and Natural Resources, as they already do for their decommissioning plans.
Geymann had made changes to his bill in response to industry criticisms and modeled it after ordinances in Tangipahoa Parish, which are considered the most restrictive in the state. Still, his measure drew opposition from the Louisiana Association of Business and Industry, Greater New Orleans Inc., the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association and the Baton Rouge Area Chamber.
State Rep. Matthew Willard, D-New Orleans, said that if Geyman’s bill had passed, it would have made Louisiana one of the most restrictive states for solar projects.

(Photo by Patrick Lohmann / Source NM)The number of people experiencing homelessness recently in New Mexico is two to four times higher than previous estimates, according to a new research paper from the state health department. 
In findings researchers announced Wednesday, nearly 31,000 unhoused people, including 869 children under age 5, sought care at non-federal hospitals in New Mexico between 2019 and 2013. Researchers arrived at that number by analyzing certain fields within 10 million patient visit records, searching for patient addresses being listed as known homeless shelters or simply “homeless,” among other indicators.
Quantifying the number of people who live on the streets in New Mexico is a “pervasive” problem, the study notes. The annual “point-in-time” count, which the federal Housing and Urban Development department requires for certain federal grants, is an undercount and can vary based on numerous factors. 
But it’s still considered an official count, and can be useful to detect trends, including huge increases in homelessness observed in Albuquerque and throughout the rest of the state in the most recent report. 

Read the study here.

In what they described as a novel approach to counting the state’s unhoused population, New Mexico Department of Health researchers Hayley Peterson and Dylan Pell determined that 30,882 patients experiencing homelessness visit hospitals nearly 183,000 times between 2019 and 2023, or nearly six visits each. The number of unhoused patients was about 8,000 in 2019 and hit a peak of a little more than 10,500 in 2022.
“Public health approaches that address infectious disease, environmental health, drug overdose, suicide and injury should include strategies to support [people experiencing homelessness] and promote stable housing,” said Miranda Durham, Chief Medical Officer for the Department of Health, in a news release. “Health system interventions like screening for housing needs and linking people to housing services can have positive health impacts.” 
The new report’s numbers are far higher than the “point-in-time” counts for those years. In 2022, for example, volunteers counted about 2,600 people in homeless shelters and on the streets. In 2019, they counted 3,241. 
The counties with the highest numbers of unhoused patients were Bernalillo, Santa Fe, Doña Ana and San Juan, according to the report.

Two-thirds of the patients were male, according to the report. Nearly 40% were Hispanic, another 40% were white, and 15% were American Indian or Alaska Native in a state where about 12% of the total population is Native American. 
A little over 2,100 of the people counted, comprising 7% of the people the researchers counted, were under age 18. 
The researchers also examined medical diagnoses the patients received, finding the top “comorbidity” along with homelessness, was alcohol-related disorders, with 17% of patients having that diagnosis. About 8% had a stimulant-related disorders, 7.1% had schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders and 4.8% were suicidal, among other common diagnoses, according to the report.
About 455 people were treated related to their pregnancy, a finding that indicates “additional supportive housing needs for families during a vulnerable life stage,” researchers wrote. 
The researchers determined that their method of counting and analyzing homelessness could help present a clearer picture of an issue that has long plagued the state. 
“These findings bolster understanding of homelessness in New Mexico and demonstrate that statewide healthcare system data can be used to report homelessness and its comorbidities,” the authors write.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0147-1024x768.png,,,2025-05-14 15:05:59.650705

Katie Miro, a first-grade teacher at Newark Charter School, has been named the 2025 Delaware Charter School Teacher of the Year, the Delaware Charter Schools Network (DCSN) announced at its annual IDEA Awards.
“Being recognized as Delaware Charter Network’s Teacher of the Year is an incredible honor that affirms the dedication and love I pour into my work each day,” Miro said. “It means even more to me because it reflects the deep relationships I’ve built with my students and their families over time.”
With over 17 years of teaching experience, Miro was recognized for her dedication to creating an engaging and nurturing learning environment.
“These connections are the foundation of everything we do as educators and remind us daily that educating young people is not a solo effort,” Miro said. “Charter schools have the unique opportunity to foster a special connection between families and schools by encouraging close collaboration and active parental involvement in shaping students’ educational experiences.”

Others praise Miro
Known for integrating nature into the classroom and championing outdoor education, she also plays a key role beyond the classroom—mentoring new teachers, serving on the school council, and leading the school’s nature club.
“Katie Miro is exactly the kind of teacher every child deserves—one who is dedicated, innovative, and deeply invested in student success,” said Gregory Meece, founding school director of Newark Charter School.
Sam Golder, head of school at Newark Charter, praised Katie’s impact.
“Katie Miro couples an effervescent personality with an incomparable work ethic,” Golder said. “She is a shining example of excellence in teaching, leadership and selflessness. Newark Charter School is so fortunate to have Katie on the team. I
cannot think of a better representative for [Delaware’s] Teacher of the Year!”
Kendall Massett, the executive director of the Delaware Charter Schools Network emphasized the importance of educators like Miro.
“We believe every child deserves an opportunity for an excellent public education,” she said. “The way to do so is with amazing educators like Katie Miro. We are proud of our phenomenal educators across all our charter schools in Delaware, but we had to choose one to represent them all. I believe that Katie will be an incredible representative for all teachers in the state of Delaware. “
Delaware is home to 24 public charter schools serving more than 19,000 students. Charter schools in the state are publicly funded, tuition-free, and operate with increased flexibility while being held accountable for student achievement.
“Together, as a charter community, we have created supportive, inclusive environments where children can thrive, and I am so grateful to be part of that journey,” Miro said.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-14-at-2.30.06-PM.png,,,2025-05-14 15:05:59.650705

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)RICHMOND — With approval of its governing board, Eastern Kentucky University became the first in the state to formally adopt policies that bring it into compliance with a Republican-backed state law banning diversity, equity and inclusion practices at Kentucky public universities. 
In its Wednesday meeting, the EKU Board of Regents passed a policy to uphold viewpoint neutrality and a resolution showing EKU plans to comply with the recently passed House Bill 4. The board also approved removing words such as “diverse” from its strategic goals. No board members voted against the measures in a voice vote. 
Kentucky public universities have been reviewing HB 4 since its passage by the Republican-controlled General Assembly earlier this year. GOP caucuses in the House and Senate easily had the votes to override Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s veto of the law, which he said “is about hate.” 
In his veto message, the governor wrote, “Acting like racism and discrimination no longer exist or that hundreds of years of inequality have been somehow overcome and there is a level playing field is disingenuous.” He also said the law would prevent universities and colleges from investigating allegations of bias except in limited circumstances.
  Laura Babbage (EKU photo)
EKU’s board members had little discussion on the new policies before they cast votes. Regent Laura Babbage asked questions about how the university will still support students from a variety of backgrounds. She added that she hoped as an institution, EKU “believes that we have responsibility to our brothers and sisters, regardless of their race, creed, beliefs or whatever the case might be.” 
“I’m not speaking for the board. I’m speaking for Laura Babbage, but I am just saying that that is an essential part of who I am,” she said. “And so as we have issues that come before us that perhaps need a voice, I will, in fact, be that voice.” 
EKU President David McFaddin said in response to Babbage that supporting all students would remain a focus of the administration. 
“Student success will continue to be our focus. Supporting students — every student — in every way that we can will continue to be a part of the institution,” he said.

The newly adopted university policy — titled “Institutional Viewpoint Neutrality” —  says that EKU “does not discriminate against individuals or groups based on their social or political viewpoints and values the contributions of all community members to robust dialogue and the free exchange of viewpoints to contribute to an intellectually diverse campus community.” The university may not require anyone to “endorse or condemn a specific ideology, political viewpoint, or social viewpoint to be eligible for hiring, contract renewal, tenure, promotion, admission or graduation.” Directing the state’s public universities to adopt such viewpoint neutrality policies was a tenet of HB 4. 
The university policy says that the EKU president has the only authority to issue official statements on behalf of the university, and may designate someone else to issue statements as needed. The board chair has a similar authority to issue official statements of the board. The president and board chair are prohibited from issuing official statements “on political, social or cultural matters that are not directly related to the operations, mission or legal obligations of the University.” The policy says that any violation “will be handled through the normal University processes.” 
The board also approved changes to the university’s strategic goals, removing a reference to supporting “EKU’s diverse learners” and replacing the word “inclusivity” with “respect.” The changes also remove “Inclusion” as a guiding value of the university, which was defined as “Community engagement, Diversity of people and perspectives, Professional growth, Hospitality, Celebration” and replaces it with “Opportunity,” defined as “Community Engagement, Multiple Perspectives and Lived Experiences, Professional Growth, Hospitality, Celebration.” 
The resolution approved by the board says EKU will follow the state law. An EKU spokesperson previously told the Kentucky Lantern the university planned to comply with the law. 
  Rep. Jennifer Decker, R-Waddy. (LRC Public Information)
The bill’s primary sponsor, Rep. Jennifer Decker, R-Waddy, said in a statement after filing the legislation that it sought “to prohibit discrimination on the basis of religion, race, sex, color, or national origin, and ensure that our university campuses are free from the failed and misguided DEI policies that have proven only to make higher education less attainable for Kentuckians.”
In a statement ahead of Wednesday’s board meeting, Decker said the law ended “discriminatory and wasteful practices on our public postsecondary campuses.” Decker added that the law ensures Kentucky public colleges “provide equal treatment to all of their students and judge students on their individual merits, not on their race, color, or creed.”
“These are institutions of learning and must focus on improving the quality of education on their campuses and increasing enrollment among all Kentuckians,” Decker said. 
HB 4 directs the governing boards of Kentucky’s public universities to enact a policy by June 30 to meet requirements under the law such as not restricting scholarship eligibility criteria on the basis of religion, race, sex, color or national origin and not requiring or encouraging students to complete courses “of which the primary purpose is to indoctrinate participants with a discriminatory concept.”
Next year on July 1, each institution must begin submitting annual certification to the Council on Postsecondary Education to verify the institution has not spent money to support DEI programs.
The law largely had support from Republicans in both the state House and Senate throughout the legislative session earlier this year. 
It comes on the heels of Republicans nationwide aiming to rollback DEI programs. President Donald Trump has taken actions against such programs, including issuing an executive order   
early in his second term aimed at curbing DEI in private sector businesses. More recently, Trump signed an executive order directing the U.S. Department of Education to overhaul university and college accreditation programs to root out DEI standards. 
Before the General Assembly passed the law, Kentucky college students held protests against the legislation on their campuses, including EKU. Students also voiced opposition in committee hearings and protests at the Capitol.

“The board is happy that we came to a resolution,” said Charlene Seward, a commissioner of the school board. “This is a great outcome for the students to continue out the rest of the year, and we’re happy for the community support, and we’re just glad that we could make it all work out.” The agreement caps off a year and half of contentious negotiations between the union and the school district, which first began last January. After months of bargaining, the two parties had reached an impasse over wages. The union had initially proposed that teacher salaries increase by 15% for the 2024-2025 school year, 10% for 2025-2026 and 10% for 2026-2027. The school board had meanwhile pitched increases of 3% each year, citing restraints imposed by the district’s $63.8 million budget for the 2024-2025 school year.After failing to find middle ground earlier this year, the two parties agreed to work with an independent fact-finder, who released a report last month calling for about 5% wage increases each year. Rejecting the mediator’s findings, the school board last week moved to impose a contract on the district’s teachers for the next two years, a decision the union claimed violated Vermont labor laws. Under the temporarily imposed contract, the board had included salary increases of 4.8% for the first year and 4% for the second year. Read the story on VTDigger here:  Rutland teachers and school board reach agreement, averting strike.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Rutland-High-School_Natalie-Williams-1-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-05-14 15:05:59.650705

More than six months ago, Rep. Rachelle Smit (R-Martin), who at the time was serving as the minority vice chair of the House elections committee, made a request to the Michigan Department of State seeking access to the Bureau of Elections e-learning portal, which provides education and training materials for the state’s election clerks.
While Smit’s office went back and forth with the Department of State, with Smit later filing a request in her official capacity as the chair of the now-renamed Elections Integrity Committee, she ultimately brought the matter before the House Oversight Committee, which issued a subpoena to the Secretary of State requesting any materials that had not already been provided by May 13 to Committee Chair Jay DeBoyer (R-Clay Township). 
Although the Department has been working to fulfill Smit and DeBoyer’s requests, a May 7 response to the subpoena from Assistant Attorney General Heather Meingast on behalf of Benson’s office reiterated security concerns in releasing these training documents to the Oversight Committee without review and redaction that would “reveal security feature information or other sensitive information jeopardizes the [voting] process.”
“This is true even if those seeking the information are well-intentioned, because each time sensitive information is released, its potential for intentional or accidental disclosure to those who would misuse it increases,” Meingast wrote, anticipating that the committee would again request a login credentials to the Bureau of Election’s e-learning portal to alleviate the expense and burden tied to processing this information for release. 

2025.05.07 House Oversight Committee subpeona response AG letter 
She also called into question the legality of the subpoena, noting that no provisions within state law or the House rules allows a committee to issue a subpoena on behalf of another committee, and that a subpoena is only valid if it serves a legislative purpose for the committee that issued it. 
Alongside the latest release of documents on Tuesday, Meingast noted that, as she’d predicted, the Department had been unable to complete a full review of the requested materials by the May 13 deadline. However the department would continue to release documents on a rolling basis until all items had been produced or if it determined items should be withheld due to security concerns. 
While the Department has issued a total of 3,300 pages of documents to the House Oversight Committee, including 300 pages issued Tuesday, Smit called the department’s pace “unacceptable.” 
“While we acknowledge the Department of State released new information today, there is no reason why Secretary Benson and her staff cannot fulfill the House’s subpoena in full today. For some baseless reason, they continue to release small batches of information and tout them as huge wins in transparency. It’s not transparency, it’s embarrassing,” Smit said in a statement.
“This is nothing more than a delay tactic being used by someone who seems to be petrified the public will actually find out how she’s been training our clerks. The Legislature has a responsibility to review these materials to ensure our clerks are being properly trained. Any attempts to prevent that core legislative function amounts to nothing more than clear obstruction,” said Smit, who has pushed disproven claims that the 2020 election was stolen, despite a 2021 report from the then GOP-led Senate Oversight Committee concluding there is no widespread evidence of voter fraud within the state. 
In her own statement published Tuesday, Benson reiterated that she has a duty to “protect the security of our elections from politicians seeking information that would enable someone to interfere with the chain of custody of ballots, tamper with election equipment, or impersonate a clerk on Election Day.”
“We’ll continue to work with the chair of the committee to explain these realities and we’ll do the same in a court of law,” She said.

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)Another former South Dakota state employee has been sentenced for a crime committed while working for state government.
Danielle Degenstein, 52, of Pierre, pleaded guilty Tuesday in Hughes County Circuit Court. A news release from state Attorney General Marty Jackley said she was sentenced to a year of probation and a $500 fine, plus an amount of court costs that was not disclosed in the release. She’ll avoid spending one year in jail if she abides by the conditions of the sentence.
Degenstein’s crime was misprision of a felony, which means she failed to report her knowledge of another person’s criminal activity.
‘Don’t do that’: Attorney general says guilty verdict in state theft trial sends a message

The chain of events that led to Degenstein’s criminal charge started in August, when state Attorney General Marty Jackley said a deceased former three-decade employee of the state Department of Revenue, Sandra O’Day, had allegedly created 13 fake vehicle titles to help her secure $400,000 in loans. No charges were filed, because O’Day died before her alleged behavior came to light.
In October, Jackley announced charges against two other former Department of Revenue employees, Lynne Hunsley, 64, and Degenstein, both of Pierre.
Hunsley has since pleaded guilty to forgery and grand theft by deception for creating a fake vehicle title that she used as proof of a trade-in to help her avoid excise taxes. She was sentenced to three years of probation and ordered to pay a $1,000 fine and $1,200 in restitution to the state.
Court documents said Degenstein concealed her knowledge of a crime committed by a person identified as “S.O.” — initials that match O’Day’s. A news release Wednesday from Jackley said Degenstein was investigated for knowing, and not reporting, that a Department of Revenue employee forged a power of attorney document for that employee’s financial gain.
The Degenstein case is among five criminal prosecutions that Jackley has filed against former state employees since last year for allegations related to their work with state government.
One former employee, Lonna Carroll, used her position at the Department of Social Services to steal nearly $1.8 million over the course of 13 years. A jury found Carroll guilty of grand theft, and she’s scheduled to be sentenced in July. Other criminal allegations against former state employees included falsifying food service inspections and the personal use of foster family food vouchers.
In response to the run of prosecutions, Jackley supported a package of four bills passed during the recent legislative session that will expand the investigatory authority of the state auditor, strengthen the Board of Internal Controls, institute mandatory reporting requirements for state employees and penalties for failing to report, and establish protections for whistleblowers.
Last month, Gov. Larry Rhoden signed an executive order mandating the creation of a “secure standard reporting mechanism” for employees. The portal will deliver whistleblower reports of malfeasance to the state’s auditor and attorney general.
Lawmakers also passed legislation this year strengthening the ability of the Legislature’s Government Operations and Audit Committee to conduct investigations and issue orders known as subpoenas requiring people to testify or supply information.
Last year, then-Gov. Kristi Noem added an extra internal control officer position to the executive branch and ordered state employees to undergo annual training aimed at preventing criminal activity.

Derrick Hildebrant, R-Catoosa, is the author of a bill that would allow municipal employees and officials to carry firearms in municipal buildings. (Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — House lawmakers on Wednesday sent a measure to the governor to allow elected officials to carry firearms at approved municipal buildings, despite concerns it could intimidate constituents. 
House Bill 1095 would allow elected municipal officials, including judges, with a valid firearm license to carry concealed guns in any building leased or owned by the city or town in their jurisdiction with the approval of a city council or governing board. The bill excludes locations that are used to process, hold or house prisoners or people under arrest, like courthouses, courtrooms, prisons, jails or detention facilities. 
Rep. Derrick Hildebrant, R-Catoosa, said this is already being done at the county level and this bill expands it to the city level. 
“This is an option, so it’s not a mandate,” he said. “Any city council can designate firearm prohibited locations or not.” 
It could extend to a “meter reader” being able to carry firearms, if they were designated by the city and working in their jurisdictional location, Hildebrant said. 
Rep. Michelle McCane, D-Tulsa, said she is worried this could intimidate constituents or make people feel uncomfortable talking to their elected officials. 
“I want us to be safe. I want our municipal folks to be safe,” she said. “But I worry that this broad of a bill kind of creates this environment where people might be intimidated. Not everybody is as supportive of guns and that can kind of be an intimidation factor.”
Hildebrant said he has not received any negative feedback on this legislation from counties who have this measure in place. 
Rep. Nick Archer, R-Elk City, who voted in favor of it, said he was frustrated by the process he had to go through as former mayor of Elk City to carry a firearm at work. He said he was required to go through law enforcement training and earn armed security guard status to be able to carry his gun at city hall. 
The bill was previously amended by the Senate, but now heads to the governor after House lawmakers approved the amendments 70-15 along party lines.

State funding is tight and, with split control in the House and a narrow Democratic margin in the Senate, more money from new taxes is unlikely. The alternative we’re left with is to cut, and that threatens a great many harmful outcomes, most of which we won’t begin to understand until well after budget bills are signed into law. 
The Senate budget, for example, proposed to decouple the state general education formula from inflation, reneging on a 2023 commitment that itself was not enough to bring per pupil funding back to where they were before cuts made in the early 2000s. Reducation of anticipated funding will financially stress school districts, suppress teacher pay, and push up property taxes. 
Similar dynamics will be felt in health and human services, natural resources, and higher education, where tuition is expected to rise by as much as 10% to make up for insufficient state funding. 
Those are high-profile cuts that will receive a lot of public airing, but reducations and underfunding over the next several years threatens wide ranging harms that most of us have not even contemplated. Consider, for instance, the impact on Minnesotans we’ve literally hidden behind walls: Our state prisons are already dangerously underfunded and about to fall even further behind. Prisons aren’t exactly the feel-good cause of our progressive fantasies, and that’s exactly why they make such a useful example of the importance of public investment. 
If we can understand the value of a functional corrections system, then we can start to view public investment in a much more productive light. 
Many policymakers are understandably reluctant to spend money on people that have broken the law when law abiding citizens have so many unmet needs. In tight times, state corrections funding is easily neglected. Unfortunately, that logic leads to costly outcomes and untenable conditions. 
Underfunding doesn’t mean more punishment, it just means more dysfunction. And that’s bad for everyone, as the current condition of our prisons clearly demonstrates.
A 2020 report by the Office of Legislative Auditor recommended closing or replacing facilities in both Stillwater and St. Cloud due to massive deferred maintenance. These facilities, along with one in Shakopee, failed to meet federal standards that require 25 square feet of space per prisoner. Two other facilities lacked sufficient plumbing for the number of inmates they housed. 
Poor conditions like this motivated a peaceful prisoner takeover at Stillwater prison in 2023. Among the grievances were lack of access to showers, poor climate control, and curtailed programming and visiting hours due to staff shortages. A 2025 report on physical maintenance needs confirmed these issues, citing leaking, flooding, dangerously hot interior temperatures, and structural deterioration — all threats to prisoner and staff safety.
Last weekend, I attended an event where a guard from one state facility recounted how his unit suffered increased assaults and staff hospitalizations due to understaffing.
Not surprisingly, DOC has the highest turnover rate of any state agency, which is itself expensive due to the cost of hiring and overtime. More competitive pay would help, but stingy budgets make necessary raises impossible.
This is just one example of how underfunding can become self-reinforcing. Here’s another: Because most prisons have closed their medical units, prisoners in need of health care must now be treated in public hospitals where they require additional around-the-clock supervision from dedicated guards. 
On a larger scale, understaffing regularly leads to reduced programming, which curtails the amount of education, counseling and other activities aimed at shortening sentences and ensuring successful release. 
This status quo leads to poor conditions for prisoners and staff, and to enormous long-term economic and societal harm. Social science research shows that incarceration leads to intergenerational cycles of poverty, violence and antisocial behavior that greatly diminishes personal and community well-being. 
And, of course, we don’t need academics to tell us that our prison system is dysfunctional. In Minnesota, for example, someone with a history in the criminal justice system is 7 to 13 times more likely to experience homelessness and around 20% of all prisoners freed each year become homeless immediately upon release. That comes with a heavy social and fiscal cost.
DOC received a much-needed budgetary increase in 2023, but more is needed if the agency is to keep up with increasing costs and added programs that came along with the money. New investments, like the Minnesota Rehabilitation and Reinvestment Act are aimed at reducing long-term costs by improving rehabilitation outcomes. That’s the right idea, but now the program risks stalling out at the pilot phase due to lack of funding.

With so much dysfunction, many on the left would like to see prisons scaled down entirely. That is the correct goal, but broader decarceration won’t happen quickly. To get there, we need to reconceptualize prisons not as a retributional system to be managed for the least immediate cost, but as institutions designed to achieve a collective priority — the minimization and correction of violent and destructive illegal behavior. 
That will require reforming an oppressive parole system as well as greater investment in substance abuse rehabilitation, counseling, and more humane facilities to promote independence and successful reintegration. Prisoners participating in work programs should also receive a reasonable wage so that they don’t end sentences in poverty — a common reality ripe for repeat offense.
Other countries do all of this very differently, and now Pennsylvania has begun experimenting with Scandinavian style prisons, which foster rehabilitation and independence by allowing greater autonomy within the facility. With multiple failing facilities, Minnesota could be ripe for an experiment like this. But it requires placing proactive problem-solving above scornful neglect. 
This year’s budget won’t give us the modern prisons that would be safer and more conducive to rehabilitation, but the difference between the good version of this year’s budget and the bad version could be enormous. 
With just $14 million of additional funding for 2026-27 — less than a 1% agency increase, despite inflation well above that — the proposed House budget would result in staffing cuts that would make all of our problems worse. Hopefully, that position is just a figment of multi-phase bargaining (the Senate increase is about $60 million and the governor’s over $100 million), but anything like it would be disastrous for tens of thousands of inmates and workers. 
The answer to all of these troubling tradeoffs, of course, is that we could easily choose a different path. Even a relatively small tax increase could provide substantial revenue to ensure agencies like corrections have the operating adjustments they need. 
The alternative is to allow prison conditions to degrade, staffing to fall, and outcomes — which have been improving — to stagnate or decline. Minnesotans likely would not notice these changes right away, but over time it will result in slower release, less rehabilitation, and more people left lost and dispossessed from their interaction with a dysfunctional criminal justice system. The result will be higher costs and lower quality of life for all of us.

The state’s childhood vaccination rates remain high, but public health officials are bracing themselves for possible outbreaks of measles and pertussis among young children as cases of vaccine-preventable diseases have risen across the nation. 
There have been over 1,000 measles cases reported in the U.S. this year alone, compared to 285 cases last year. Three people have died from the virus, once deemed eradicated in the country, including two unvaccinated children in Texas. 
“Our first line of defense is our immunization rates,” said State Health Officer Dr. Dan Edney at the State Board of Health Meeting April 10.
Kindergarten vaccination rates have fallen to fourth in the nation. Last school year, the state had 97.5% coverage for the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, compared to 99.1% for the 2019-2020 school year, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. A vaccine coverage rate of 95% or higher is needed to prevent measles outbreaks.
There have not yet been any reported measles cases in Mississippi, though cases of pertussis, or whooping cough, have accelerated this year. State public health officials say the risk of widespread outbreaks among young children, who are most susceptible to both diseases and severe complications that can lead to death, is low due to high vaccination rates. 
But relying solely on statewide vaccination rates can be deceiving, because it can camouflage clusters of unvaccinated people, said Jana Shaw, a professor of pediatrics at SUNY Upstate Medical University who studies childhood vaccinations and vaccine hesitancy. 
“Transmission of (measles) happens at the community level,” she said. “So if you’re looking at a state level, you may be falsely reassured that the situation is better than what you expect.” 
And vaccine exemptions are the single most important driver of disease outbreaks, said Shaw. 
Parents have requested 5,845 religious vaccine exemptions since they became available in Mississippi two years ago. Over 800 were requested this year. 
Mississippi long permitted only medical vaccine exemptions authorized by a doctor for school entry. That changed in 2023 when a federal judge ruled that parents can opt out of vaccinating their children due to religious beliefs.
The number of exemptions ranges by county, with the highest rates of vaccine exemptions among children in Lincoln, George and Stone counties, using 2023 Census data to calculate child population. 
The lowest rates of religious vaccine exemptions are in Scott, Washington and Leflore counties. 
A fourth of religious vaccine exemptions approved by the state did not list a county. This is because parents are sometimes unsure in which county a child will attend school or day care when they complete the form, said a spokesperson for the Mississippi State Department of Health. 
Only 30% of the state’s approved religious exemptions are for children enrolled in a kindergarten through 12th grade public, private or church school when the exemption was approved. The remaining 70% are for children who were homeschooled, enrolled in day care or not yet enrolled in school.
To request a religious vaccine exemption in Mississippi, a parent or guardian must submit a form and make an appointment at their local county health department to watch a vaccine education video and discuss the benefits and risks of immunization with a nurse. Parents are also informed that if any vaccine-preventable disease occurs or threatens to occur in the community, the child will not be allowed to attend school or day care. 
Religious vaccine exemptions are important because they protect parental autonomy, said Shaw. But they can become a problem when the laws are misused – for convenience or due to misinformation or disinformation. 
Mississippi’s law, which requires parents to go to the county health department and talk to a nurse, helps create safeguards against this, said Shaw, whose research has shown that the easier it is for parents to get a child exempted for non-medical reasons, the higher a state’s exemption rate. 
The health department has made changes to the process, including informing parents with approved religious exemptions that they can choose to vaccinate their children at any time. The agency has also advised providers to continue having conversations about vaccinations with parents who have religious exemptions on file.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/10113531/AP25099762919062.jpg,,,2025-05-14 14:08:35.733013

Magnolia State baseball fans know well the traditional hardball success of the three largest universities, a tradition that continues in the spring of 2025. Three hundred teams play NCAA Division I baseball. Ole Miss, Southern Miss and Mississippi State all seem likely to make the elite 64-team NCAA Championship Tournament field.
But Mississippi’s college baseball prowess does not end there. Delta State and Mississippi College have both made the NCAA Division II Tournament and will compete in regionals in Florida later this week. Millsaps College, under the leadership of Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame coach Jim Page, has made the NCAA Division III Tournament for the first time since 2015. Belhaven University lost in the finals of its conference tournament but takes a 31-13 record into its first-ever NCAA Division III Championship Tournament. William Carey University finished its season ranked No. 10 in all of NAIA baseball with a 38-14 record. The Crusaders hosted an NAIA Regional but lost their first two games Monday and Tuesday.
What follows is a breakdown of what each of those Mississippi teams faces in postseason play:


Mississippi College enters NCAA tournament play for the first time since 2018, having won seven or its last nine games, including four consecutive victories over arch-rival Delta State. The Choctaws will face Lynn University (30-16) in the opening round Thursday at 4 p.m. The regional will be hosted by the University of Tampa. Host Tampa (43-7) will play Albany State (30-20) in the other first round game.
Tradition-rich Delta State (32-18), making its 37th NCAA Tournament appearance, plays West Florida (33-19) in a first round game Thursday at 2 p.m at Lakeland, Fla., where Florida Southern is the host school. Florida Southern (36-13) plays West Alabama (32-23) in the other first round game. Coach Rodney Batts’ DSU Statesmen badly need a return to form entering national tournament play. They have lost five straight games, including a three-game series to Mississippi College and then two straight in the Gulf South Conference tournament. Delta State played a three-game series at West Florida in early March, losing two of three.
A quick look at Millsaps’ baseball history might have foreshadowed that the Majors would return to postseason play in 2025. Page’s teams have made the tournament in 1995, 2005, 2015 and now 2025. This will be the Majors’ ninth NCAA appearance overall, all under Page. The Majors (29-13) travel to Marshall, Texas, for the East Texas Baptist Regional and will face East Texas Baptist (28-14) in the first round Friday at 2:30 p.m. Top-seeded Trinity (36-7) will play Huntingdon (22-19) in the other first round game Friday at 11 a.m.
Belhaven, which lost to Huntingdon 3-1 in its conference championship game, faces Rhodes College (27-16) in the first round of the Edwardsville, Ill. Regional Friday at 2:30. Host Webster (36-7) plays Milwaukee School of Engineering (27-16) in the other first round game. Belhaven is making its first postseason appearance since Mississippi Sports Hall of Famer Hill Denson took them to the NAIA World Series in 2011.



Southern Miss produced two of the five finalists for the Boo Ferriss Trophy, which will be awarded Monday at a luncheon Monday at Pearl River Resort. The five finalists in alphabetical order:

Drake Fontenot (Delta State pitcher): A senior right-hander from Bossier City, La., Fontenot was the Gulf South Conference Pitcher of the Year, sporting a 9-2 record, a 2.23 earned run average, 84 strikeouts and 23 walks.
Luke Hill (Ole Miss third baseman): The Arizona State transfer from Baton Rouge hit .342 with eight home runs and 32 runs batted in.
JB Middleton (Southern Miss pitcher): A former Benton Academy standout from Yahoo City, Middleton likely will be the Sun Belt Pitcher of the Year after producing a 9-1 record, with a 2.0 ERA and 98 strikeouts compared to 22 walks. Middleton is the highest rated MLB prospect among Mississippi college players.
Nick Monstere (Southern Miss second baseman): The former Northwest Rankin standout and Mississippi High School Player of the Year hit .330 with 17 home runs and 61 RBI.

Tommy Tuberville participated in a charity golf tournament in Birmingham Wednesday, just hours before the U.S. Senate was scheduled to take up confirmations of personnel in President Donald Trump’s administration.
Tuberville was scheduled to appear at the 2025 Regions Tradition on Wednesday, a charity golf tournament located at the Greystone Golf & Country Club. Other people scheduled to appear included former Auburn football player Bo Jackson, Auburn head football Coach Hugh Freeze and UAB Head Football Coach Trent Dilfer.
“The senator is in Alabama today for a charity golf tournament that he goes to every year. He is planning to be back in D.C. for votes later this evening,” said Mallory Blount Jaspers, a spokeswoman for Tuberville, on Wednesday.
Tuberville participated in the charity event in 2023 and 2024, which is expected to raise more than $24 million with Children’s of Alabama, a pediatric acute care children’s hospital located in Birmingham.
The U.S. Senate schedule for the day includes a full slate of confirmation votes for senators to consider, including the morning, which Tuberville will likely forego while in Alabama.
The U.S. Senate generally holds a four-day work week, with the first vote on Monday at 5:30 p.m. and the last vote typically taking place Thursday afternoon at 1:45 p.m.
The Senate is set to be in recess for 15 weeks this year, in addition to the regular long weekends. The chamber was set to hold eight votes on Wednesday, including to confirm Emil Michael to be undersecretary for research and engineering at the Department of Defense and for Eric Ueland to become deputy director for management at the Office of Management and Budget.
Other members of the Senate have missed votes this year, including Rhode Island Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, who was in South Korea in late April for the “Our Ocean Conference.” Whitehouse missed a vote on a measure to reject President Donald Trump’s tariff policy. That measure failed on a tied 49-49 vote.
It likely would have been approved had Whitehouse been there. Kentucky Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell, who previously indicated opposition to Trump’s tariff policies, also missed the vote.

(Elaine Cromie / Chalkbeat)This story was originally published by Chalkbeat. Sign up for Chalkbeat Detroit’s free newsletter to keep up with the city’s public school system and Michigan education policy.
 
Proposed cuts to federal funding for local libraries could end essential services for Michigan students, particularly in rural and impoverished communities, according to state officials.
The Trump administration’s proposed 2025-26 budget would eliminate the federal department that provides funds to state library agencies. The cuts would mean the loss of nearly $4.8 million for the Library of Michigan, as well as grants that support Native American libraries in the state. The funding provides services that support K-12 students, such as early literacy programs, as well as access to the internet, technology, testing materials, tutorials, and online databases.
While most of the state’s library dollars come from local sources, rural, small, and lower-income communities struggle to raise enough revenue to maintain basic services and must rely on federal funds, said Diane Golzynski, deputy superintendent of business, health, and library services for the Michigan Department of Education, during a State Board of Education meeting on Tuesday.
Potential cuts to statewide library services come as the number of school librarians in the state are dwindling and gaps in student literacy achievement are widening.
On March 14, President Donald Trump signed an executive order calling to eliminate funding for the federal Institute of Museum and Library Services – the largest source of funding for state library agencies– as well as several other agencies.
Since then, 21 states, including Michigan, sued the federal government arguing the cuts would effectively dismantle the Institute of Museum and Library Services and two other agencies. The complaint argues that the executive order violated federal law because the institutions were created and funded by Congress.
A federal judge earlier this month issued a preliminary injunction in the case, temporarily preventing the cuts.
The Library of Michigan recently was notified it will receive federal funding already granted in a contract through the end of September 2026, said State Librarian Randy Riley during the board meeting.
“But after that, everything’s up for grabs,” he said, adding that the cuts proposed in Trump’s budget “would be terrible for what we do.”
Riley said there’s a risk that the statewide public database services the Library of Michigan provides – including the Michigan eLibrary, which gives access to online books, and the Michigan eLibrary Catalog, which lets residents order physical copies of books from collections in other parts of the state to their local libraries – could end or be significantly altered.
Or, the state might need to increase funding for local libraries to replace potential federal funding shortfalls in the future, Riley said.
The role of Michigan’s 397 local libraries in K-12 literacy has become more important over the years, advocates say, as school libraries have become more rare.
The number of school libraries in the state is unclear. However, data on the number of full-time certified librarians employed by districts suggests funding for school libraries has declined significantly in recent years.
The state ranks 47th in the nation for school librarians per student, according to the most recently available data analysis. The number of school librarians in the state dropped 73% between 2000 and 2016 – one of the biggest declines in the country.
Decades of research show access to well-sourced libraries and certified librarians help improve student outcomes.
In a recent national assessment, Michigan ranked 44th in the nation for fourth-grade reading.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)An Upstate engineer announced his bid Wednesday to be the 2026 Democratic nominee challenging U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham.
Lee Johnson, a Greenville businessman, touts on his campaign website a lifetime of “building things from the ground up,” saying he wants to take his commitment to hard work to Washington.
“I wasn’t born into politics. I was born in a construction family, operating heavy equipment before I could drive,” Johnson said in launching his bid to oust South Carolina’s senior senator. “My family taught me how to build things — like roads and bridges — and I’ve carried that with me everywhere: from construction sites and factory floors to boardrooms.”
  Lee Johnson, a Greenville engineer, is a Democrat running to unseat Sen. Lindsey Graham in 2026.
Johnson, like any Democrat in a statewide race in South Carolina, will face an uphill battle. But Democrats’ last attempt to unseat Graham could make that climb steeper.
According to polls in fall 2020, Graham was supposedly in a dead heat against Democrat Jaime Harrison, who became the first U.S. Senate candidate to raise more than $100 million.
Instead, Graham won the nation’s most expensive race ever, as of 2020, by 10 points in a contest that reverberated down the ballot. (Harrison went on to lead the Democratic National Committee.)
Six years earlier, Graham bested state Sen. Brad Hutto by more than 17 points.
Graham, first elected to the U.S. Senate in 2002, has become one of the most visible figures in the GOP.
He already received a 2026 endorsement from President Donald Trump, who Graham briefly campaigned against in a short-lived run for president in 2015. The two have had a sometimes-rocky relationship since.
Graham’s re-election campaign is co-chaired by Gov. Henry McMaster and U.S. Sen. Tim Scott.
Yet, he remains divisive.
Trump’s endorsement followed a Greenville Republican announcing a challenge to Graham.
As of the end of March, Mark Lynch, owner of Jeff Lynch Appliance Center, had put $5 million of his own money into his campaign, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission.
Several more Republicans could jump in for next summer’s GOP primary, as Graham often draws multiple challengers from his right flank.
But the Senate Budget Committee chairman is a fundraising juggernaut, with $15.9 million in cash on hand, according to his latest FEC filing.
Johnson, who is limiting himself to two terms, pledged to not take any money from corporate political action committees.
“Lindsey Graham built a career for himself,” Johnson said. “I’ve spent my life building for others.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/lindseygraham-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-14 14:08:35.733013

(Photo by Becca Paschal/Arkansas Governor's Office)President Donald Trump approved a major disaster declaration for Arkansas Tuesday after denying the request last month. 
Federal disaster assistance is available to Arkansans in Green, Hot Spring, Independence, Izard, Jackson, Lawrence, Randolph, Sharp and Stone counties who were affected by severe storms and tornadoes March 14-15, according to a press release issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Tuesday night. 
Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-interest loans to cover uninsured property losses and other programs to help individuals and business owners with their recovery efforts, according to the release. 
The president issued the disaster declaration after a call with Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, according to a statement issued by the governor’s office late Tuesday.
“Our entire state is grateful for President Trump’s leadership and assistance as we recover from the devastating storms that struck Arkansas earlier this spring,” Sanders said. “I had a productive conversation with the President in which he expressed his support for our state and I offered my full endorsement of his plans to reform FEMA to save money and provide greater direct assistance to disaster victims.”

Trump has convened a council to review and recommend “improvements or structural changes” to FEMA, and suggested the agency might “go away.” He has also said states would best take care of disasters on their own, with the federal government reimbursing some of the costs. 
Under Trump, FEMA has denied federal assistance to Arkansas, West Virginia and Washington state, and refused North Carolina’s request for extended relief funding following Hurricane Helene, according to Stateline.
Sanders requested Major Disaster Relief for Arkansas on April 2. The state received a denial from the federal government regarding Individual Assistance funding through FEMA on April 11, according to the Arkansas Division of Emergency Management. Sanders sent a letter appealing the denial on April 18. 
“Arkansas communities are still recovering from this spring’s tornadoes, as the sheer magnitude of this event resulted in overwhelming amounts of debris, widespread destruction to homes and businesses, the tragic loss of three lives, and injuries to many others,” Sanders said in a statement last month. “To relieve the burden on these counties, cities, and towns, I am appealing FEMA’s decision to deny Arkansas’ Major Disaster Declaration request.”
Individuals and business owners in the designated counties who sustained losses can apply for assistance by registering online, using the FEMA App or calling 1-800-621-3362.

Madison County voters narrowly approved a 1% sales tax to support the maintenance and operation of an under-construction, 148-bed county jail that’s scheduled to be complete in June. Voters had twice rejected a similar ballot measure and barely passed Tuesday’s measure by 16 votes, according to unofficial results. 
The results were “a little bit too close” for Madison County Judge Larry Garrett, who said Wednesday morning he was “relieved” about the outcome, which he anticipated would have a narrow margin.   
“It’s big for our county and it’s going to be big for our future,” he said. “We’re excited to get started down that road.”
Madison County only has a 24-hour holding facility currently, so prisoners are transported and held in other counties around the state, which costs money and manpower, Garrett told the Advocate last week.
Following formal certification of the results by election officials, Garrett said it will be a few months before the county starts receiving the new tax revenue and can hire staff, so the jail likely won’t be operational until December or January.
Two Arkansas counties consider jail sales tax proposals in Tuesday’s special elections

“I appreciate the people of our county stepping up and taking care of business,” he said.
In Pope County, voters rejected an $89.9 million bond issue to support construction of a new facility to house a county jail, 911 call center, the sheriff’s office and the office of emergency management. According to unofficial results, 1,723 people voted for the measure and 1,862 voted against. 
Voters also rejected a 0.75% sales tax to pay off the bond debt with 1,624 people voting in support of the measure and 1,986 voting against it. 
Pope County Judge Ben Cross said Monday he anticipates the issue will be presented to voters again in a couple of years because county government only operates on sales tax and property tax, and revenue is needed to meet the growing county’s needs. 
“The problems don’t go away just because the tax failed,” Cross said. “I would anticipate that a future sheriff and a future county judge will have no other option than to present this to the voters again because we continue to grow and we continue to have inadequate services. So it’s going to be up to the voters to take their security and their safety as a priority.”
County officials started the year with 11,000 active misdemeanor warrants, but because of overcrowding, the current 172-bed jail is only being used to hold felons and people who’ve committed violent misdemeanors like domestic violence, Cross said Monday. Pope County’s population has doubled since the current jail was constructed in 1981, according to county officials. 
Pope County government hasn’t solicited a tax increase in more than 30 years, according to Cross, who said Wednesday he was hopeful that would resonate with voters. However, he acknowledged a variety of factors likely played into voters’ decision to reject the measures, including “the national climate” and low voter turnout. Only 10% of registered voters participated in Tuesday’s elections, according to election officials.
“Ten percent decided for the next 90% what was going to happen,” Cross said. “You’ve got voter fatigue, voter apathy, so it’s just a conglomeration, but there’s no doubt that the national uncertainty of economics plays into everybody’s voting process.”

(Photo from the CDC)The Pittsburgh-area lab responsible for certifying virtually all U.S. government-approved respirators in the country was preparing to shutter for good in June. The Capital-Star reported last month that employees had been told their positions were being eliminated as part of sweeping cuts to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The lab is responsible for certifying and auditing just about every N95, as well as masks worn by doctors, firefighters, welders, coal miners, and other professionals.
But those plans changed Tuesday afternoon. Officials with the local chapter of the American Federation of Government Employees union say many, if not all, employees remaining at the Bruceton facility, many of whom were on administrative leave, received an email telling them their jobs were safe — at least for the moment.
“You previously received a notice regarding the Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) upcoming reduction in force,” read an email sent to lab employees by Thomas Nagy, the agency’s acting chief human capital officer, and shared with the Capital-Star. “That notice is hereby revoked. You will not be affected by the upcoming RIF.”
The employee who shared the email did so under the condition of anonymity, for fear of retaliation.
But a union official told the Capital-Star between recent buyouts, layoffs and early retirements, it’s been difficult to say with certainty how many employees remain. And with so many on administrative leave, it’s been hard to confirm if anyone did not receive the notification Tuesday.
“We’re still trying to figure out what it all means and who it all covers,” said Suzanne Alison, a steward at the local American Federation of Government Employees chapter that represents Allegheny County’s NIOSH employees. “We’re crowdsourcing a little bit among ourselves.”

A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to detailed questions about the decision to reverse the planned cuts, but said that, “The Trump Administration remains committed to supporting coal miners, who play a vital role in America’s energy sector. Under Secretary [Robert F. Kennedy Jr.]’s leadership, NIOSH’s Coal Workers’ Health Surveillance Program will continue to meet the needs of our nation’s miners.”
Workers at the National Personal Protective Technology Lab learned their jobs were no longer being cut on the same day a U.S. District Court judge in West Virginia granted an injunction ordering employees of NIOSH’s mine safety and respiratory health divisions return to work following previous cuts. That was in response to a class action case led by West Virginia coal miner, Harry Wiley.
It’s unclear if there was any connection between the ruling and the reversal of cuts to the respirator certification lab. Alison said the ruling likely only affected employees at NIOSH’s Morgantown division, who also faced steep cuts earlier this year.
West Virginia Republican Senator Shelley Moore Capito said Tuesday on the social media platform X that over 100 employees would be returning to work at the Morgantown facility.
However, employees at NIOSH’s Pittsburgh-area Mining Research Division, which studies best practices  for avoiding workplace injuries and deaths, do not appear to have received the same notices as those at the respirator certification lab, Alison said.
Kennedy is scheduled to testify Wednesday before both the U.S. House Appropriations committee and the U.S. Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committee to discuss his agency’s proposed budget, which includes drastic staff cuts.
There are two Pennsylvania representatives on the House Appropriations panel, Republican Guy Reschenthaler and Democrat Madeleine Dean.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-14 17:06:24+00:00,CT Mirror,Pending complaints against police would be secret under Connecticut bill,Jim Haddadin | Connecticut Public,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/14/police-complaints-ct-foia-bill/,A provision in a bill that passed the Senate would shield more records from disclosure under the Connecticut Freedom of Information Act.,"A bill that would make secret pending complaints against police and corrections officers in Connecticut has cleared a major hurdle in the legislature, alarming government transparency advocates in the state.
Members of the state Senate last week unanimously passed a measure that aims to strengthen data reporting requirements for law enforcement.
The bill, introduced in the wake of a false traffic stop probe of the Connecticut State Police, makes intentionally entering false information into a law enforcement record a felony. It also establishes that providing false information is grounds to cancel or revoke a police officer’s certification, and obligates police chiefs to promptly notify state prosecutors if they suspect an officer has engaged in criminal conduct.
Proponents say those measures will enhance police accountability. However, a provision in the bill would also shield more records from disclosure under the Connecticut Freedom of Information Act. That state law guarantees the public the right to view documents such as police misconduct reports.
The bill would create a new FOIA exemption barring the release of any formal complaint against a police or correction officer until it is “investigated and adjudicated by the proper legal authority.”
[RELATED: Several CT bills would limit public access to records through FOIA]
Colleen Murphy, executive director and general counsel of the Connecticut Freedom of Information Commission, said the new exemption would erode transparency in the state because it could allow agencies to keep the public in the dark about problems that arise.
“In the realm of complaints against officers, I think sometimes what we’ve seen at the commission is there might be a complaint that’s filed and then it never gets fully investigated, the officer moves on,” Murphy said. “If this were to pass, the public wouldn’t really have any understanding of what the basis was for that sudden departure.”
Bill born out of traffic stop data controversy
Momentum for the underlying bill took hold last year in the aftermath of investigations into faulty traffic stop data provided by state police.
State Rep. Greg Howard, a Stonington Republican who works as a police detective, said he drafted an amendment to the bill in order to protect police who are falsely accused of misconduct from reputational harm.
Howard said he feels lawmakers and news media unfairly impugned the reputations of many law enforcement officers whose inaccurate reporting of traffic stop data was previously called into question.
“I think that public trust in police officers is paramount, and transparency is extremely important, but so is truth,” Howard said. “And transparency of truth and facts is what we’re looking for.”
An audit by the Connecticut Racial Profiling Project raised concern about false or inaccurate racial profiling information provided by 130 current and former state troopers and constables.
An independent investigation requested by Gov. Ned Lamont later found the majority of the troopers are unlikely to have engaged in intentional misconduct, saying most of the inaccurate information was due to mistakes and technical errors.
However, the report also critiqued state police, finding the agency failed to respond effectively when it first learned in 2018 of a handful of troopers who intentionally falsified traffic stop data, or to investigate broader problems in its system.
In response, the governor introduced a bill in 2024 to strengthen data reporting requirements. House Republicans amended the bill to additionally create the new FOIA exemption, which prevents disclosure of pending complaints.
The bill ultimately failed to pass last year, but was reintroduced in the Senate this year. It received a favorable recommendation from the Joint Committee on Judiciary, which heard public testimony in March.
Advocates speak out as Democratic leadership remains silent
The five Democratic co-chairs and vice chairs of the Judiciary Committee did not provide comment for this story. Spokespeople for Reps. Steven Stafstrom and Jack Fazzino said the two men were not available. Sens. Gary Winfield, Sujata Gadkar-Wilcox and Mae Flexer did not respond.
Representatives of the ACLU of Connecticut, the state Freedom of Information Commission (FOIC) and the CT Council on Freedom of Information oppose creating the new FOIA exemption. In written testimony, they argued it would allow agencies to indefinitely withhold records of misconduct, which are of significant public interest.
Staff from the FOIC highlighted the selection process for a new police chief in Hartford. After being tapped to lead the Hartford Police Department earlier this year, a police captain in Philadelphia abruptly withdrew from the position. The Philadelphia Inquirer reported records surfaced showing that he had been accused of sexual harassment.
“Police officers, correction officers, perform a huge public service, and we place so much faith and trust in them, and we rely on them to enforce the laws properly,” said Murphy, the FOIC executive director. “But with that trust, there must be accountability over that role.”
Brian Anderson, legislative and political associate director for AFSCME Council 4, which represents corrections employees and most municipal police officers in Connecticut, said the state has a strong system for investigating misconduct allegations.
He noted that state law makes police officers ineligible to be hired by another law enforcement agency if they retire while under investigation for malfeasance or other serious misconduct.
“We have layer upon layer of examination of police officers to make sure they’re doing their job properly,” he said.

,DC,2025-05-14 16:58:03+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump’s attack on birthright citizenship to be heard by U.S. Supreme Court,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trumps-attack-birthright-citizenship-be-heard-us-supreme-court,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Supreme Court justices on Thursday are set to hear oral arguments in three cases stemming from the Trump administration's attempt to end the constitutional right of birthright citizenship — though the focus may be on the power of district court judges to issue orders with national effects.It’s one of the first major legal fights of the Trump administration’s second term to reach the high court, and one of several immigration-related emergency requests to be considered.The justices have before them three challenges to President Donald Trump’s executive order to end birthright citizenship, from courts in Maryland, Massachusetts and Washington state. Under birthright citizenship, all children born in the United States are considered citizens, regardless of their parents’ legal status.But the Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to focus instead on whether lower court judges can issue nationwide injunctions, rather than the constitutionality of the executive order. Such injunctions affect everyone in the country and not just those involved in the case or living in the court’s district.It is up to the court alone to decide, though, what it wants to consider, and justices could also wade into the birthright citizenship question.If birthright citizenship were to be eliminated, more than a quarter of a million children born each year would not be granted U.S. citizenship, according to a new study by the think tank Migration Policy Institute.It would effectively create a class of 2.7 million stateless people by 2045, according to the study.The lawyers who will be making oral arguments in court are New Jersey Solicitor General Jeremy Feigenbaum and Kelsi Corkran, Supreme Court director at Georgetown’s Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection.In briefs, they argue that the Trump administration has not shown it will be harmed by the multiple district courts placing the executive order on hold.On the core issue of birthright citizenship, in their briefs, they argue that the 14th Amendment “guarantees citizenship to all born in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof” and cite Supreme Court cases that have upheld birthright citizenship to those born in the U.S.Nine justices, three casesThe nine justices will hear arguments on whether lower courts erred in granting a nationwide pause on the policy that extended beyond the plaintiffs who initially filed the challenge.Immigrant rights’ groups and several pregnant women in Maryland who are not U.S. citizens filed the case in Maryland; four states — Washington, Arizona, Illinois, and Oregon — filed the case in Washington state; and 18 Democratic state attorneys general filed the challenge in Massachusetts.Those 18 states are California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Vermont and Wisconsin.Solicitor General D. John Sauer, who will argue on behalf of the Trump administration, has criticized the nationwide injunctions as impeding the executive branch's authority. The Trump administration has contended that it’s unconstitutional for federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions. Instead, the Trump administration said, the injunctions should be limited to those who brought the challenges.Wong Kim Ark caseOn Trump’s Inauguration Day, he signed an executive order, which was originally planned to go into effect Feb. 19, that children born in the United States would not be automatically guaranteed citizenship if their parents were in the country without legal authorization or if they were on a temporary legal basis such as a work or student visa.Birthright citizenship was adopted in the 14th Amendment of the Constitution in 1868, following the Civil War, to establish citizenship for newly freed Black people. In 1857, in Dred Scott v. Sandford, the Supreme Court initially denied citizenship to Black people, whether they were free or enslaved.In 1898, the Supreme Court upheld birthright citizenship, when the justices ruled in United States v. Wong Kim Ark that children born in the U.S. are citizens.In that case, Ark was born in San Francisco, California, to parents who were citizens of the Republic of China, but had a temporary legal authority to be in the country, such as a visa.When Ark left the U.S. for a trip to China, on his return his citizenship was not recognized and he was denied reentry due to the Chinese Exclusion Act— a racist law designed to restrict and limit nearly all immigration of Chinese nationals.The high court eventually ruled that children born in the United States to parents who were not citizens automatically become citizens at birth.In arguments in the lower courts on the current case, attorneys on behalf of the Trump administration argue that the Wong Kim Ark case was misinterpreted and pointed to a phrase in the 14th Amendment: “subject to the jurisdiction.”The Trump administration contends that phrase means that birthright citizenship only applies to children born to parents who are “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States. In their view, people in the U.S. without legal status or temporary legal status are “subject to the jurisdiction” of their country of origin.Tribal sovereigntyTribal law scholars have noted that the language pertaining to “jurisdiction of” stems from the idea of political alliance when it comes to tribal sovereignty.It’s from another Supreme Court case involving the U.S. citizenship of American Indian citizens, which the Trump administration focuses on in its argument, citing Elk v. Wilkins in 1884.In that case, the Supreme Court denied citizenship to John Elk, a Winnebago man living in Omaha, Nebraska, on the grounds that “Indian tribes, being within the territorial limits of the United States, were not, strictly speaking, foreign states; but they were alien nations, distinct political communities.”Torey Dolan, an assistant professor of law at the University of Wisconsin Law School, said the Trump administration’s reliance on Elk in its birthright citizenship executive order and the idea the political alliance of a parent would then transfer to a child is a misinterpretation.“A lot of this reliance on Elk is really a distortion,” Dolan said. “I think the administration's reliance is a stretch, at best, and a bastardization of the case, at worst.”Dolan, an enrolled citizen of the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, said some Native Americans were excluded from citizenship in the 14th Amendment because during that time, Congress would specifically sign treaties with tribes and grant citizenship.“That is consistent with a long history of Congress creating pathways to Indian citizenship,” she said.After the justices hear arguments on Thursday, any decision is likely to come before the Supreme Court’s recess in early July.",,,,2025-05-14 13:13:31.662954

(Photo: NCGA screengrab)The North Carolina Senate Agriculture, Energy, and Environment Committee voted Wednesday morning to confirm Donald van der Vaart as a member of the North Carolina Utilities Commission, forwarding the resolution to the Senate Select Committee on Nominations.
Appointed by Republican Treasurer Brad Briner, van der Vaart previously served as North Carolina’s environment secretary. He’s a climate skeptic who was considered for EPA administrator during the first Trump administration.
Van der Vaart began his state government career with two decades in the state’s Division of Air Quality. Republican Gov. Pat McCrory promoted him to secretary of the Department of Environmental Quality in 2015, NC Newsline previously reported.
His term on the Utilities Commission, if confirmed, would start July 1 of this year and expire on June 30, 2031.
The Utilities Commission is an agency responsible for regulating the rates and services of all investor-owned public utilities in North Carolina. It’s the oldest regulatory body in state government, according to its website.
At Wednesday’s meeting van der Vaart was asked a handful of mostly friendly questions.
“What specific strategies do you think you’ll employ to ensure your decisions remain impartial, evidence-driven, and resistant to any undue influence from any of the stakeholder groups?” Sen. Buck Newton (R-Greene, Wayne, Wilson) asked.
Van der Vaart said he would rely on the structure that’s currently in place, which includes a “capable” staff that works independently.
“I’m very much interested in using the transparency to the public to provide a forum where free discussions can be not only had, but also viewed,” he said.
He’s faced criticism in the past due to a potential conflict of interest with his wife’s work.
Van der Vaart served as the chief administrative judge on a DEQ dispute over the regulation of a toxic chemical in September. His wife Sandra is chair of the North Carolina Chamber Legal Institute, a prominent lobbying group opposed to PFAS regulation, the Port City Daily reported.
Newton also asked Van der Vaart to share his thoughts on legislation which would eliminate the interim goal for Duke Energy to cut its carbon emissions by 2030.
“A lot of times, goals and mandates get conflated. Do you see this as a goal or some sort of a mandate?” asked Newton.
Van der Vaart said the interim goal does provide the state with “offramps” if things don’t go as planned.
“I think if you look back a little bit into this, you’ll see that some of the load predictions and the requirements that were anticipated in the past turned out to be somewhat inaccurate. Now the 2050 goal appears to be a mandate,” Van der Vaart responded.
Critics of SB 261 have argued that not having an intermediate goal could make it harder to reach carbon neutrality by 2050. The bill was fast tracked through the Senate in March, but has yet to see action in the House this session.
Sen. Jay Chaudhuri (D-Wake) joked that van der Vaart may hold the most degrees out of all nominees in front of the legislature: a bachelor’s in chemistry from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, a Juris Doctor from North Carolina Central University, a master’s in chemical engineering from North Carolina State University, and a doctorate in chemical engineering from the University of Cambridge.
Chaudhuri also asked what van der Vaart thought was the most important role for the utilities commission.
“The most important role, despite the fact that we regulate a number of utility functions, is to deliver reliable and affordable energy within the confines that are mandated,” van der Vaart said. “We need to work very hard to maintain the affordability of our electricity… If we didn’t have a consumer advocacy function in North Carolina, then we would be ill served.”
Asked about the rising demand for natural gas and pipeline capacity to meet industrial growth, Van der Vaart said this was an issue of critical importance in sustaining the electric grid.
“I think that one of my interests will be to determine and to convince myself that we have the kind of physical capacity and redundancy from a national security standpoint to be able to continue to deliver manufacturing support electricity and various other residential uses of natural gas reliably in the future.”
Environmental groups and clean energy advocates have raised concerns about the build out of natural gas pipelines, amid worries about the impacts on water, air and habitats, and greenhouse gas emissions.

Along with voting to confirm van der Vaart, the committee heard a resolution to approve Reid Wilson as the DEQ secretary, following appointment from Democratic Gov. Josh Stein. This portion was “discussion only” and the panel did not take a vote.
Wilson formerly served as secretary for the Department of Natural and Cultural Resources from 2021 to 2024. Before that, he was DNCR’s chief deputy secretary from 2017 to 2020. He’s been serving as DEQ secretary on an interim basis while awaiting confirmation.

(Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — A state Supreme Court ruling Wednesday maintains a six-week abortion ban in South Carolina.
Issuing their third ruling on abortion since 2022, justices unanimously decided state law’s definition of “fetal heartbeat” — the sound of which makes an abortion illegal — applies to when an ultrasound first detects cardiac activity.
Attorneys for Planned Parenthood argued the ban that took effect in August 2023 should apply at nine weeks rather than six, since the heart doesn’t actually form until roughly the ninth week of pregnancy.
Justices disagreed, noting repeatedly that the debate in the Statehouse and prior arguments before the justices themselves referred to the law “consistently and exclusively” as a six-week ban.
“The answer to the question is clear: the General Assembly was referring to the occurrence of electrical impulses that mark the early onset of ‘cardiac activity’ as we interpret ‘fetal heartbeat,'” Justice John Few wrote in the opinion signed by three justices. Justice Gary Hill agreed with the majority but wrote his own opinion.
Like in the law itself, which doesn’t specify a number of weeks when abortion becomes illegal, justices’ ruling does not set a timeline.
But “the biologically identifiable moment in time we hold is the ‘fetal heartbeat’ under the 2023 Act occurs in most instances at approximately six weeks of pregnancy,” Few wrote.
Legislators clearly intended the ban to take effect at about six weeks in a pregnancy, justices wrote.
If that were not what legislators believed the law to be, “it is inconceivable that no member of the House or Senate made any effort to point out that the members of this Court misunderstood the General Assembly’s intent,” Few wrote.
Even legislators opposed to the law indicated they believed it started at six weeks through amendments they proposed. For instance, three amendments introduced in the House during the debate would have held a father responsible for child support starting at six weeks of pregnancy, the point at which legislators believed the ban began.
“While none of these Amendments passed, they each clearly indicate the members proposing them — again, opponents of the Act — considered the 2023 Act to be effective upon events occurring at approximately six weeks of pregnancy,” Few wrote.
Much of Planned Parenthood’s argument centered around the exact wording of how the law defined a “fetal heartbeat.”
A fetal heartbeat, under the 2023 law, is “the steady and repetitive rhythmic contraction of the fetal heart.”
Those electrical impulses are not “steady” or “rhythmic,” as the law requires, attorneys for Planned Parenthood argued. At that point, the pregnancy is still considered an embryo, not a fetus. And no heart forms until several weeks later in the pregnancy, meaning there is no “fetal heartbeat,” attorneys argued.
But the words “steady” and “rhythmic” have no medical definition, Few wrote.
Legislators have previously used the words “embryo” and “fetus” interchangeably, and attorneys for Planned Parenthood didn’t give an exact moment when the pregnancy changes from one to another. And it’s unclear exactly when a heart is considered “formed,” Few wrote.
One word did have a clear meaning, justices decided.
Under the law, most abortions are no longer legal after “the unborn child’s fetal heartbeat has been detected.” That suggests “an actual, observable event,” Few wrote.
“The only point in the progression of a pregnancy when cardiac activity goes from ‘cannot be detected’ to ‘detected’” is the moment a doctor can hear the electrical impulses that occur around six weeks, Few wrote.
Gov. Henry McMaster praised the state high court’s latest decision as again upholding the law, as justices did in 2023.
“Time and time again, we have defended the right to life in South Carolina, and time and time again, we have prevailed,” McMaster said in a statement. “Today’s ruling is another clear and decisive victory that will ensure the lives of countless unborn children remain protected and that South Carolina continues to lead the charge in defending the sanctity of life.”
Taylor Shelton, the plaintiff in Planned Parenthood’s case, quickly learned she was pregnant but couldn’t get an appointment for an abortion before the six-week cutoff, attorneys have said in court filings. Attorneys argued that Shelton, who traveled to North Carolina to receive an abortion, should have been eligible for one in her home state.
Many people don’t yet know they’re pregnant by six weeks in a pregnancy, said Jace Woodrum, executive director of the state American Civil Liberties Union. Some doctors are reluctant to provide lifesaving care to pregnant women out of fear that they’ll be prosecuted under the law, he said.
Under the law, doctors who violate the ban face the possibility they’ll lose their license, spend up to two years in prison and/or have to pay a $10,000 fine.
“The extreme ban on most abortions is endangering the lives of pregnant South Carolinians and driving medical care providers away from our state,” Woodrum said in a statement.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_1531-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-05-14 13:13:31.662954

Chris Murphy's plans come as President Donald Trump plans to accept a luxury private plane from the Qatari royal family.,"U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) plans to force the Senate to vote on arms sales to any country that does personal business with President Donald Trump’s (R) family. This comes as Trump plans to accept a luxury private plane from the Qatari royal family.
Military deals can typically advance in the Senate without a vote, so long as no member objects.
Following the plane announcement, Murphy said he wouldn’t let certain arms deals go through the legislative body without a fight.
“We should have a full Senate debate and vote,” Murphy said.
Just weeks ago, the U.S. State Department approved a $2 billion arms sale to Qatar. In Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, Trump signed a defense sale worth more than $140 billion.
Trump’s family stands to profit from a deal in the United Arab Emirates, where the president will also visit this week. A UAE venture firm will use stablecoins issued by the family’s blockchain company to pay for a $2 billion crypto exchange investment.
The announcement drove up the stablecoin’s worth.
“Trump’s stablecoin just became the fifth most valuable stablecoin in the world, because of the Emirati investment,” Murphy said.
“Donald Trump is going to the Middle East in order to receive tribute from nations who know the game is simple: if they want favorable treatment from the United States when it comes to our foreign policy, then they don’t have to do anything that supports our own national security,” Murphy said. “They just have to put money in Donald Trump’s pocket.”
Trump has defended the Qatari plane gift, saying it would be “stupid” to turn away a free, expensive airplane.
“I think it’s a great gesture from Qatar,” Trump said. “ I appreciate it very much. I would never be one to turn down that kind of an offer.”
Murphy is one of four Democratic senators sponsoring a resolution to condemn the acceptance of the gift. Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.), who on Monday did not comment on whether the deal was ethical, would have to call it for a vote.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) is also unhappy with the deal.
He said he plans to hold all Department of Justice political nominees until he gets answers from the Foreign Agent Registration Act unit (FARA) on what Qatari foreign agents are doing in the U.S. and whether they’re benefiting Trump.
Schumer also wants to know more about the plane, such as what security measures are already installed, who will pay for its upkeep, and who in the Trump administration made the deal.

While Gov. Healey is right that Massachusetts can't make up the $16 billion in federal funds the state receives annually from the federal government, we have to be prepared to protect our people from the worst of the harm coming from Trump.
The post The Commonwealth has the money to protect the common wealth appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","WHEN I SERVED as the first student member of the Amherst-Pelham Regional School Committee, deep in the 20th century (1983-84), in the aftermath of Proposition 2½, I remember hearing the phrase “tough budget year” for the first time.  I have heard it virtually every year since. I wondered back then: Maybe our state simply does not have enough wealth to support the schools and colleges and communities we want.After 30 years of hearing that austerity mantra, I remember in 2014 reading a Boston Globe article by then-journalist and now Tufts University state policy center director Evan Horwitz, titled “If Massachusetts were a country, how rich would it be?” The answer was that a Republic of Massachusetts in 2014 would have been the fourth wealthiest nation on earth, just ahead of Hong Kong, Sweden, and Switzerland.  It was a stunning revelation about how much annual income is generated in the Commonwealth.Given what we are facing now, we in the Massachusetts Teachers Association thought it useful to ask the question again, to see how we are doing 10 years on.So, how wealthy is the “Republic of Massachusetts” today? The latest available figures from 2023 on income show that a Republic of Massachusetts would still rank as one of the wealthiest nations on earth, with a per capita income of $90,596, a remarkable jump from 2014, when per capita income, adjusted to 2023 dollars, totaled $58,141.  A Republic of Massachusetts today trails only Monaco ($180,080), Bermuda ($130,290), Lichtenstein ($116,440), Norway ($102,910), and Switzerland ($95,070) when looking at per capita income. And even though global income from the same period is measured somewhat differently, adding such factors as capital gains, which are not part of the state calculation, the point is that Massachusetts has the means of a nation to support what the state values.This all matters right now because we know terrible cuts are coming from the federal government.  Between Trump’s mob-like attempts at blackmail – using the threat of withholding federal funds unless we abandon our commitments to educating and celebrating all of our students and telling truthful history – and the commitment to stealing health care from millions on Medicaid in order to fund further tax breaks for the very wealthy, we have to expect a huge budget threat. And while Gov. Healey was right to say, as she did recently, that there is no way Massachusetts can make up the $16 billion in federal funds the state receives annually from the federal government, we have to be prepared to protect our people from the worst of the harm coming from Trump.  (Note that Massachusetts residents and businesses pay over $150 billion in federal taxes every year; we are a “donor” state, meaning we send more taxes to DC than we get in federal spending – to the tune of $46 billion.)And because we are looking at taxable income, Massachusetts does have the ability to buffer whatever blows come from the Trump administration. The real question is whether our state has the political will to take bold action. I believe the answer is “yes.”One practical solution is to have Massachusetts implement the Corporate Fair Share bill introduced by Sen. Jason Lewis and Rep. Carlos Gonzalez. This bill could raise an additional $400 million for Massachusetts by exposing more of the profits a megacorporation stashes offshore to state taxes. Massachusetts currently taxes 5 percent of this so-called global intangible low-taxed income, while other states — and the federal government—tax 50 percent of a corporation’s GILTI. The Corporate Fair Share bill brings us in line with other states.Fair and pragmatic tax policies work.We in the MTA played a central role, as part of the Raise Up Massachusetts coalition, in making our tax system fairer by getting the wealthiest – the half of 1 percent of the wealthiest households in the state – to pay a little more so we can invest in our public schools, colleges, and transportation systems. The voters agreed with us at the ballot in 2022, passing a constitutional amendment that adds a surtax on high earners.Almost everyone – including those who spent millions to protect the uber-rich from paying four cents more on every dollar over the first $1 million in annual income – is thrilled by the $2.5 billion coming in annually to state coffers and being spent on free tuition for community colleges, universal school meals, money for literacy supports, for child care, for aid to middle class school districts, and for improving the T and local roads and bridges, and providing free regional buses.The millionaires and billionaires haven’t left – as too many egg-on-their-face commentators predicted – because Massachusetts is a place those wealthy people want to live – and where they have made money, hand over fist.So, when the federal cuts come and we hear about a really “tough budget year,” and politicians say with conviction that we will have to “tighten our belts,”  let’s instead ask ourselves:  Will we undermine our public schools and colleges, devastate research at our public universities, lay off mental health workers, defund our hospitals, all so that the very, very rich can hold onto their latest round of Trump tax-cut millions? Or will our legislative leaders and our governor make the logical, moral, and strategic decision and mirror the 2022 electorate by passing and signing into law progressive revenue legislation to counter Trump’s draconian maneuvers and maintain our commitments to the quality of life in our state?That is the “Republic of Massachusetts” I want to live in.Max Page is president of the Massachusetts Teachers Association.The post The Commonwealth has the money to protect the common wealth appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20240924_132530-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-14 13:13:31.662954

Marshall Smith for The Marshall Project)Last summer, Kenneth Barrett recalls spending 46 days — about half the summer — in solitary confinement at Algoa Correctional Center, a minimum security prison in Jefferson City. 
In segregation, he was confined to a cell roughly the size of a parking spot for 23 hours a day. Barrett said he had brown tap water to drink, chilled only by the occasional delivery of ice. There were no electrical outlets to plug in a fan, he said. And no escape from his cell except for a warm or hot shower, three times a week.

He said he remembers a correctional officer telling him that it was 107 degrees outside his cell one day, which made sense, because the overhead vents only recirculated hot air. 
Algoa, a nearly century-old facility, is one of four prisons in the state with no air conditioning in any of the housing units, according to the Missouri Department of Corrections. 
As Barrett tells it, conditions throughout the prison are “among the worst” he’s experienced in his more than six years in prison. But it was in solitary confinement where he feared for his life: His cell had no button to push in case of a medical emergency, he said.
On May 12, attorneys with the MacArthur Justice Center, a civil rights legal organization, filed a class action lawsuit against officials at the Missouri Department of Corrections on behalf of people incarcerated at Algoa, alleging that the prison’s “brutally hot” conditions constitute cruel and unusual punishment for those forced to endure dangerous temperatures with little to no relief. 
In interviews with The Marshall Project – St. Louis, and sworn statements to The MacArthur Justice Center, men incarcerated at Algoa, Ozark Correctional Center and Moberly Correctional Center described the effects of unrelenting heat in facilities with limited or no air conditioning. 
Their experiences underscore the unique dangers of extreme heat for people in solitary, also known as administrative segregation (ad-seg for short), or the hole.
Barrett was among nearly two dozen incarcerated men who provided sworn statements in support of the civil rights complaint. Accounts of his experience are drawn from his sworn testimony.
“When medical emergencies like heat stroke occurred, we had to kick on the doors and scream for help,” Barrett wrote in his sworn statement. “Often, it took over an hour for anyone to come. Sometimes, no one came to help.”  
When correctional officers did respond to the noise, Barrett said, officers frequently punished people for speaking up by writing them up for a disturbance. When he experienced his own symptoms of heat stroke — lightheadedness, nausea, and chest pains that made it hard to breathe — he reported himself to medical, but still wasn’t allowed to leave his cell, he said. 
The complaint calls for the Missouri Department of Corrections to develop a heat mitigation plan to respond to future heat emergencies at Algoa, including maintaining a “safe indoor temperature between 65 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit” inside every unit in the prison. The new safety plan should also include revised policies for solitary confinement, and for medically vulnerable populations. 
If the state is unable to implement a plan, the complaint argues three of the incarcerated petitioners with less than a year left on their sentences should be released. 
Missouri Department of Corrections Communications Director Karen Pojmann said ice is delivered to restrictive housing units, such as solitary confinement, three or more times a day. She added that Centurion, the prison’s medical provider, has “numerous protocols in place for all institutions” when temperatures rise above 90 degrees, including “additional checks on elderly residents, chronically ill residents and residents taking certain medications.”
However, the accounts of men incarcerated during the summer at several Missouri prisons suggest the state’s heat mitigation efforts have fallen short. 
“Some of these rooms down in ad-seg can get easy triple digit heat indexes for days at a time,” David Blackledge, who is incarcerated at the partially air-conditioned Moberly Correctional Center, wrote using the prison’s email system to The Marshall Project – St. Louis in response to questions about his experience. 
He described a heat so oppressive that it was impossible to get more than 2 to 4 hours of sleep a night. When the ice machines worked, rather than using the ice to cool his water, Blackledge said he would use the ice to chill his bedsheets. “At bedtime I take my clothes off, wrap my body in the frozen sheet, and then mummify myself,” he wrote. 
“I really thought I was going to die from heat stroke last year,” he wrote. “The heat gets so bad it often causes panic attacks. Hallucinations are not uncommon.”

Extreme heat makes being in the hole even worse. The heat is a “compounding force” that exacerbates existing physical and mental health challenges that often come with solitary confinement, according to David Cloud, a postdoctoral researcher at Duke University School of Medicine. Cloud published a study in 2023 on the correlation between extreme heat and suicide watch in solitary.
In Louisiana prisons without air conditioning, Cloud found the rate of daily suicide watch incidents increased by 29% when the heat index reached the “caution” level, defined for the study as 80-89 degrees Fahrenheit. Daily incidents increased by 36% when the heat index reached “extreme caution,” defined as 90-103 F. Since people in solitary have exceptionally limited freedom of movement, Cloud said extreme heat not only can cause physiological harm, but increases the likelihood of “that slow agony of psychological pain.” 
The temperature reached 97 degrees last year in Jefferson City, where Algoa and another state prison are located, according to Extreme Weather Watch, an archive of historical weather patterns. But temperature alone is an incomplete indicator of how hot it really feels in humid places. In an expert report for the civil rights case, University of Arizona postdoctoral fellow Ufuoma Ovienmhada recorded a heat index (a temperature measurement that also includes humidity) of up to 110 degrees outside Algoa some days last summer. She also noted that the temperature inside the prison was likely hotter because the building materials absorb the sun’s heat all day. 
The risk of heat exhaustion is ever-present in prison. The first signs of heat exhaustion include profuse sweating, lightheadedness, clammy skin and a weak pulse. The symptoms can quickly turn to heatstroke. If left untreated, heatstroke can lead to organ failure, permanent neurological damage, and disability or death. The key to avoiding death or long-term injury is to treat symptoms swiftly by cooling the body down externally, and by hydrating with plenty of fluids.  
People in prison don’t have that option, said Dr. Fred Rottnek, former medical director at the St. Louis County jail. The traditional ways to “self-cool” such as taking a cold shower, going to a cooling center or turning on the AC aren’t available. Incarcerated people’s health during a heat emergency is almost entirely dependent on  ”the ability to get help from staffers, either medical or security,” Rottnek pointed out. 
Extreme heat intensified medical and mental health conditions for Allen Fuller, who was incarcerated at Algoa in the summer of 2024. Fuller wrote in his sworn statement that he has been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder (characterized by symptoms of both schizophrenia and mood disorders such as bipolar disorder) and suicidal tendencies, and also struggles with another medical condition that causes near-daily vomiting.
“I hear voices that get more pronounced when I am hot. My mind starts playing tricks on me,” Fuller wrote. “When I told staff I was hearing voices, they told me to stay under my fan,” he said, adding that he also vomits more frequently in the heat. 
“The staff response to anything seems to be to send people to the hole,” Fuller continued, adding that incarcerated people’s pleas for help are often met with yelling and screaming. “I know we did wrong and that is why we are here, but we are still humans and have rights.” 
Incarcerated people said extreme heat also makes prison conditions worse. In the humidity, beds begin to sweat until they rust. Cockroaches are driven out of their crawlspaces and into people’s cells. Irritability and desperation cause fights to break out over the last cup of ice, or the final spot in the rec room. 
“You just lay in your bunk and wanna die,” Cole Ogle, who is incarcerated at Ozark Correctional Center, another facility with no air conditioning, told The Marshall Project – St. Louis. 
Ogle said the heat at Ozark, a minimum security prison that focuses on substance use treatment, exacerbates an already tense atmosphere. Even the personal fans, available only to a subset of the prison population who can afford them or land a spot in the coveted free fan program, do little but blow more hot air around the cells. The prison often cancels outdoor recreation on the hottest days, Ogle added, even if it’s slightly cooler outside.  
Pojmann, the spokesperson for the Missouri DOC, said in an email that facilities without air conditioning in the housing units “have the means to effectively circulate air through the wings” and keep residents cool using “industrial fans, misting fans, sprinkling stations, cold drinking water and ice machines.”
 If ice machines struggle to keep up with the demand for ice, Pojmann said, “facility administrators are instructed to purchase as much supplemental ice as necessary.” 
While air conditioning might seem like the most straightforward solution to the problem, implementing AC is costly, and not always possible. Prison renovations can cost taxpayers millions of dollars. And some of the oldest prison buildings can’t be outfitted with air-conditioning units throughout the building due to their age, according to Pojmann. 
Incarcerated people report that even these buildings noticeably have air conditioning in administrative offices, classrooms, clinics and other areas where staff work — just not in the housing units where incarcerated people live.
Access to air conditioning can also be weaponized in prison. Ovienmhada, the postdoctoral fellow, who is also one of the lead authors of a national study of extreme heat in US prisons, pointed to examples from incarcerated people she’s interviewed of correctional officers coercively withholding air conditioning, or blasting the AC to dangerously low temperatures as punishment. 
Because these prisons are unable to offer meaningful reprieve from the heat to incarcerated people, Ovienmhada and Cloud have suggested the release of vulnerable people from prison as one solution.
“Building new prisons with air conditioning is not the solution,” said Cloud, the Duke University researcher. “We have to talk about closing prisons that keep people in these types of conditions.”  
The MacArthur Justice Center lawsuit calls for swift policy change at Algoa. Jefferson City has already seen a handful of days in the 80s this year, including a high of 86 degrees in April. Shubra Ohri, one of the lead attorneys in the case, stressed that steadily rising temperatures across the state each summer mean that danger is imminent. A heat emergency could strike in a matter of weeks, she said, and, “Algoa isn’t ready.”
As a minimum security prison, Algoa largely houses people who are nearing the end of their sentences. Because of extreme summer temperatures, some — like Arnez Merriweather, who is scheduled for release in October — worry they may never make it home. Merriweather recently learned his kidneys are failing, which increases his risk of life-threatening consequences from extreme heat.  
“If you want to know what Hell feels like, it is summer at Algoa,” Merriweather wrote in his sworn statement. “I need to survive this summer so I can get home… and I’m terrified of what will happen.”

Sears,,,,,https://marylandmatters.org/2025/05/14/maryland-loses-coveted-aaa-bond-rating/,Moody's announced Wednesday that it had downgraded the state's creditworthiness. The change from AAA rating to AA1 means the state — and taxpayers — could pay more in interest on borrowed money.,"State officials, including the governor, Senate president and House speaker, made the state's case last week to bond-rating agencies. (Screenshot from government presentation)Maryland lost its treasured “triple triple-A” bond rating Wednesday when a key bond-rating agency downgraded its assessment of the state’s creditworthiness to Aa1.
The move by Moody’s ends more than three decades in which Maryland held the highest bond rating from the three rating agencies: Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch. Moody’s had given Maryland a AAA rating every year since 1973 — until Wednesday. Prior to Wednesday’s announcement, Maryland was one of 14 states to have the highest rating from the three major agencies — Fitch, Moody’s and Standard & Poors.
A triple-A rating means the state pays the lowest rates when it sells bonds to fund public projects. The downgrade means the state — and taxpayers — could pay more in interest on that borrowed money.
The change announced Wednesday could mean taxpayers will pay more in interest on the money the state borrows.
The next bond sale is scheduled for June 11.
The rating downgrade was not wholly unexpected.
A year ago, Moody’s reaffirmed the state’s AAA rating, but noted concerns in its report and lowered the state’s outlook from stable to negative. Among those concerns were looming structural deficits driven by programs including the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future education reforms.
Gov. Wes Moore (D) and legislative leaders this session set about taming a $3.3 billion projected deficit with cuts, cost shifts and $1.6 billion in taxes and fees. But as lawmakers were crafting a budget amid a chaotic first 100 days of the second term of Republican President Donald Trump, Moody’s issued another report seen as a potential harbinger of a rating downgrade.
That report listed Maryland as the state at highest risk for economic problems as a new federal administration set about slashing agency budgets and employment.
Moore, Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) and House Speaker Adrienne Jones (D-Baltimore County) took the rare step of meeting in person with Moody’s officials in Annapolis last week, to present a united front as they made the state’s case for a better rating.
Last month, Moody’s downgraded the District of Columbia from AAA to AA1. The firm cited impacts from federal workforce reductions as well as weakening demand for commercial real estate.
Besides Moody’s, which gave Maryland an AAA rating in 1973, Standard & Poor’s first rated Maryland AAA in 1961 and Fitch has given it that raking since 1993.

ChristianaCare has become the first health system in the country to offer a robotics-focused research fellowship led by bedside nurses, a groundbreaking initiative aimed at integrating advanced technology into clinical practice.
On April 30, the health system honored the first four nurses to complete the Nursing Research Fellowship in Robotics and Innovation, a program developed under a $1.5 million grant from the American Nurses Foundation’s Reimagining Nursing Initiative. The fellowship is part of ChristianaCare’s broader three-year study examining the role of collaborative robots in nursing.
Over an eight-month period, nurses from a range of specialties received intensive training in research methodology. Their work culminated in presentations at national conferences and efforts toward academic journal submissions.
The inaugural fellows were Briana Abernathy, Elizabeth Mitchell, Hannah Rackie, and Morgan Tallo — all practicing nurses at ChristianaCare facilities. Their projects explored how robotics could support clinical workflows and reduce strain on nursing staff.

“When you create programs that empower nurses to lead, innovate and tackle meaningful challenges, you see real impact — not just in new skills and knowledge, but in job satisfaction, well-being and retention,” said Susan Smith Birkhoff, Ph.D., RN, who created and led the fellowship as ChristianaCare’s program director of Technology Research & Education.

The fellowship allowed participants to step away from daily clinical duties and engage in hands-on research. While only four nurses were directly involved, they shared their learning with colleagues across the health system, encouraging broader engagement with research and innovation.
The initiative has already gained national recognition. It was highlighted as a model of innovation by the American Nurses Credentialing Center during its evaluation of ChristianaCare, which recently earned its fourth Magnet designation. 
“What makes this fellowship stand out is its focus on giving bedside nurses a real seat at the table,” said Adriane Griffen, DrPH, MPH, MCHES, vice president of programs at the American Nurses Foundation.

“When nurses are trusted to lead and have the right support, they develop solutions that are practical, sustainable and transformative,” she said. “This fellowship shows how nurse-led innovation can grow from a local pilot into a model for improving care across the country.”
Danielle Weber, DNP, RN, NEA-BC, ChristianaCare’s chief nurse executive, said the program reflects the system’s broader commitment to nurse-driven innovation.
“Innovation is about improving care, easing the burdens on our teams and finding smarter ways to meet the complex needs of our patients,” Weber said. “Tools like collaborative robots don’t replace the human touch, they help protect and elevate it.”

The Salton Sea will soon become a major hub for California’s renewable energy economy, prompting the legislature to take steps to ensure future investments benefit local communities that have long been left behind.


The Salton Sea is a haven for wildlife, a repository of critical minerals and the site of some of the worst environmental and economic conditions in California. 
The contrast between its natural riches and its impoverished population has sharpened as companies seek to mine vast deposits of lithium, a mineral used to make batteries for electric cars, computers and cellphones.
“Today, the Salton Sea region stands at a critical juncture with a chance to become a major domestic supplier of lithium,” state Sen. Steve Padilla, who represents parts of Riverside, Imperial and San Diego counties, recently told the Senate Committee on Business, Professions and Economic Development.
The Chula Vista Democrat wants to give the region a bigger say in how it grows amid the projected lithium boom. His bill, SB 534, would create a “green empowerment zone” around the sea that would govern how to use public money, invest in local communities and support the transition to a renewable energy economy.
It would be run by a board of directors with representatives from Imperial and Riverside Counties, local cities, tribal members, energy experts with the University of California and large, private employers.
Padilla’s proposal is modeled after a similar program for the Contra Costa waterfront, which aimed to build on an existing workforce in the renewable energy sector. That program was due to expire in 2028, but two northern California lawmakers are proposing to extend it to 2040, to blunt the economic impact of the Marathon oil refinery closure in Martinez.
In contrast, the Salton Sea proposal in Southern California aims to position an emerging renewable energy industry for rapid growth, and ensure that local residents get a piece of the pie.
Development of lithium mining and other energy projects “could drive regional prosperity, create high paid jobs, support a well-articulated workforce” and boost industry in the desert, Padilla said.
But local advocates say there’s a risk that neighboring communities could be left behind. Most of the region faces poor air quality, high unemployment, an untrained workforce and limited health care access.
The region’s 150,000 inhabitants have also been split along jurisdictional lines. Imperial County communities are lumped in with San Diego, while the Coachella Valley and eastern Riverside County areas are attached to the Inland Empire. But those southeastern desert areas — with low-income, rural, largely Spanish-speaking communities — have more in common with each other than with their respective urban counterparts, the bill notes. Gov. Gavin Newsom last year vetoed a bill that would have created an economic hub similar to SB 534 to help stitch these areas together. 
Padilla acknowledged that the region has often suffered disappointment through “major boom and bust cycles, economic promises that have often failed to deliver sustainable quality of life improvements to the residents and local communities.”
Salton Sea residents and local organizations want to make sure they don’t miss out on the benefits of what state leaders hail as a “white gold” rush in the region.

 Democrat, State Senate, District 18 (Chula Vista)



“The development of a California-based clean energy supply chain in the Salton Sea region that facilitates vocational and higher education opportunities for local residents, in their pursuit of high road quality jobs in the Imperial Valley emerging clean energy sector, is a priority,” said Christian Torres, director of climate equity and resilience for the nonprofit Comite Civico Del Valle. 
The organization has already challenged a Salton Sea project called Hell’s Kitchen, which promised to be one of the world’s largest lithium mines.
Comite Civico Del Valle and the nonprofit Earthworks argued that the company proposing the mine, Controlled Thermal Resources, didn’t fully address the project’s effects on water supply and air quality, and didn’t properly consult with local Native American tribes. A judge cleared the project to start in January, but the groups filed an appeal in March.
Aydee Palomino, an environmental justice project manager with the nonprofit Alianza Coachella Valley, a co-sponsor of Padilla’s bill, said a green empowerment zone would help local agencies collaborate on funding applications and projects and provide “a structured way to ensure everyone has a seat at the table, shares responsibilities, and advances regional priorities,” she said.
It’s part of a broader effort by Padilla to bolster the Salton Sea region. Last year he introduced legislation to create the Salton Sea Conservancy, which will improve habitat around the inland sea, with water features for shorebirds and revegetation projects along its banks. Nearly half a billion dollars in state and federal funds are devoted to that effort.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/020323_Geothermal-Lithium_AD_CM_02.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-14 12:20:51.201109

Duke Energy and Dominion, who operate in North Carolina are pushing utility-friendly legislation in Senate Bill 261 — now pending in the North Carolina General Assembly — which would fundamentally change the regulatory approval process. If it passes, North Carolina ratepayers will be required to pay much higher utility bills for decades to come.
If adopted, SB 261 would allow these utility companies to charge their electric customers upfront for the costs of building new plants. You might remember that this practice resulted in dire consequences in South Carolina where ratepayers are still paying for the failed VC Summer nuclear plant.
Here’s how it worked: To pay for VC Summer, the utility company SCANA was allowed to charge its ratepayers using something known as “Construction Work in Progress” (CWIP). That’s what they call the setup where customers pay all the upfront costs to build a new power plant. The entire financial burden and the risks were placed entirely on customers and none of it on utility shareholders. When the VC Summer plant finally went belly-up, SCANA and Westinghouse both declared bankruptcy, SCANA executives were prosecuted and a few even went to jail. Guess who was left holding the bag for the $9 billion failed power plant that never was completed? If you guessed “ratepayers” then you’d be right!
Is this the path North Carolina wants to take?
As a former member of the South Carolina Public Service Commission, I fear that history will repeat itself in North Carolina. These utilities should not be allowed to circumvent the normal regulatory process. My hope is that the North Carolina legislature will keep its longstanding regulatory process in place. It’s worked well for years for North Carolina’s large manufacturers, small businesses and residential ratepayers.
The North Carolina Utilities Commission and the commissioners who serve on it are currently required by law to look out for the best interests of everyone in the state who pays a power bill. Legislative changes that would undermine their ability to do their job should be soundly rejected.
Our existing regulatory process was put in place to protect consumers from utility monopolies who are motivated to increase profits for their shareholders. That is why the North Carolina legislature should continue to rely on the state’s utility commissioners who possess the integrity and impartiality to be fair to all parties.
Don’t make the mistakes that the South Carolina legislature made years ago by passing a law known as the Base Load Review Act. Our South Carolina ratepayers are still paying for those mistakes every month when those utility bills arrive in the mail. Sadly, our ratepayers are now stuck with those high rates for decades to come.
Neighbors are supposed to look out for each other. Your neighbor to the south is warning you that trouble is on the way in Raleigh unless North Carolina senators and House members say ‘no’ to the approach spelled out in Senate Bill 261.
Fortunately, it’s not too late for North Carolina senators and representatives to rethink and reject this approach.

“Public records show that Nevada pet shops import puppies from awful Midwestern puppy mills that no consumer would knowingly support,” testified Rebecca Goff of Humane World for Animals, formerly the Humane Society of the United States, which released an undercover investigation earlier this year that traced puppies sold in Nevada pet stores to puppy mills. 
The bill is named for Cindy Lou, a dog that died after its medical needs were neglected by a Las Vegas pet store, according to the investigation. 
“Breeding dogs are treated like breeding machines with no regard for their wellness,” Goff said of puppy mills. “Under USDA standards, they can be kept stacked in wire cages that are only six inches longer than their bodies for their entire lives. They could be bred repeatedly until their bodies wear out, and then they can be killed.”
Christy Stevens, executive director and founder of Hearts Alive Animal Clinic, says retail puppy stores flout animal welfare laws and were implicated in two forensic investigations and necropsies (animal autopsies) conducted last year by Hearts Alive. 
“In one case, a woman who had been repeatedly sold Yorkie puppies by a pet store was later found to be hoarding animals in appalling conditions,” Stevens told members of the Senate Natural Resources Committee. “Despite the stores knowing that the puppies were dying in her care, they continued to sell her puppy after puppy, Seventeen dead Yorkies were later discovered in her freezers. This is not an isolated incident. It is evidence of a system where profit is prioritized over animal welfare.”
In the second case, authorities found close to 200 dogs, birds, and guinea pigs in a home, hotel room, and vehicle belonging to a Las Vegas couple, and 66 were dead. Dozens of the animals were purchased from the Petland store in Summerlin, where employees were aware of the multiple purchases, testified Gina Greisen of Nevada Voters for Animals. 
But opponents, primarily industry representatives, complained the legislation would unfairly punish all stores, even those that contend they obtain puppies and kittens from reputable breeders. 
“In New York and in California, 93 to 95% of all of the pet stores that were affected and impacted by a pet sale ban closed,” testified Alyssa Miller, a lobbyist for the Pet Advocacy Network, a trade association that represents pet stores. “The idea that someone can just shift a business model is misleading and is also unrealistic.”
PAN is also represented by Nevada lobbyist Alisa Nave, whose family business owns more than a dozen veterinary clinics that serve the same rescue organizations that support the pet store sales ban. Nave declined to comment.
Former Republican State Sen. Warren Hardy, a lobbyist representing Humane World for Animals, told lawmakers that given the failure of the federal government to adequately regulate or shut down puppy mills, there’s no room for compromise. “After 12 years of trying, there’s no middle ground on this. This is our option.”
Eight states, including the entire West Coast and some 500 municipalities,  including Clark County, Reno, North Las Vegas, and Mesquite, have prohibited retail pet sales. 
The majority of pet stores in Nevada, including national retailers Petco and Petsmart, already do not sell puppies, but “thrive as part of the $147 billion pet products and service industry,” noted Goff. 
“We’re in a time when we are cutting government personnel at all levels and agencies,” observed Jill Dobbs, executive director of the SPCA of Northern Nevada. “It is not reasonable to expect there to just be regulations that can be enforced on these businesses.”
The Nevada Assembly approved the measure, Assembly Bill 487, following a hearing last month. Without passage by a Senate committee this week, the bill will die. 
Goff confirms she was told by Senate Democrats to line up the votes to pass the contentious and emotionally-charged measure out of committee if she wanted a hearing. Democratic Committee Chair Michelee Cruz-Crawford, fellow Democratic Vice-Chair Melanie Scheible, and the caucus spokesperson would not respond to questions about the ultimatum, which negates the purpose of a legislative hearing.  
The hearing appeared on the legislative schedule Monday, after inquiries from news media. 
Killing for space
The Animal Foundation (TAF), Southern Nevada’s primary government-supported shelter, announced publicly Tuesday the facility is currently housing more than 1,000 animals, including 547 dogs, and is on the brink of killing animals to make room for more. 
Shelters in the U.S. euthanized more than 1 million dogs and cats in 2016, according to Best Friends Animal Society. Last year, that number dropped to below half a million. 
“Roughly 7 million people in America are planning to acquire a pet this year, and if just 6 percent more people chose to adopt versus purchase their pets, we would end the killing of dogs and cats in our nation’s shelters,” said Julie Castle, the organization’s CEO. 
“We’re in a critical capacity crisis, and are making urgent pleas to the public to adopt and foster,” TAF’s CEO Hilarie Grey told lawmakers. “Right now, we have terriers, Labradors, French and English bulldogs, Aussies, poodles, Cocker Spaniels, even a Papillon.” 
“There’s no need to continue supporting the puppy mill pipeline, but there’s great need for ethical businesses to partner with shelters and rescues to promote adoption while selling pet supplies or services,” Grey testified. “Sign us up. We will gladly bring puppies and kittens.”
Clark County taxpayers spend more than $10 million a year supporting TAF, Commissioner Michael Naft testified, in addition to spending millions more on animal control and code enforcement, “all with the goal of shelter diversion. We know that pets that come from pet stores end up disproportionately higher in shelters and at our rescues, and we need to put an end to that.”
Clark County resident Casey Kern testified there is “no justification for allowing the sale of commercially-bred animals while healthy, adoptable cats and dogs are being euthanized simply because there aren’t enough loving, responsible homes and they cannot be warehoused indefinitely.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/beagle-in-research-lab.png.avif,,,2025-05-14 12:20:51.201109

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)Two North Dakota judges have ruled that lawsuits filed by landowners against carbon pipeline company Summit Carbon Solutions can proceed over objections about court procedures.
Several landowners are suing Iowa-based Summit Carbon Solutions, which is attempting to build a network of pipelines across five states. The pipelines would take carbon dioxide emissions captured at ethanol plants to sites in western North Dakota for permanent underground storage.
Attorneys for Summit had filed motions to dismiss the lawsuits, arguing that not all parties involved were properly notified and that the cases were not filed in the proper court.
Senate passes bill restricting eminent domain for carbon pipelines

South Central Judicial District Court Judge Pam Nesvig issued her ruling Friday rejecting Summit’s arguments in one case in which landowners are suing Summit and the North Dakota Public Service Commission.
South Central Judicial District Court Judge Jackson Lofgren filed a similar ruling Tuesday in another case in which landowners are suing Summit entities and the North Dakota Industrial Commission.
The Public Service Commission in November granted Summit a permit for its pipeline route, about 333 miles through southeast and south-central North Dakota.
The Industrial Commission in December granted permits for underground permanent storage of carbon dioxide in Oliver, Mercer and Morton counties.
South Central Judicial District Court Judge David Reich has yet to rule on a motion to dismiss in another case where Burleigh County is suing the North Dakota Public Service Commission and Summit Carbon Solutions.
Among the issues raised in the PSC cases is that the agency did not give enough consideration to the safety of residents along the pipeline route. The lawsuit also challenges the PSC’s ruling that state zoning rules trump county zoning ordinances on pipelines.
The PSC ruled last year that a 2019 state law gives the state the upper hand on pipeline setbacks – such as how far away the pipeline must be from a residence – after Summit said Emmons and Burleigh had passed unreasonable set ordinances.
In the Industrial Commission case, landowners contend the state Department of Mineral Resources withheld information about Summit’s models that would predict where the carbon dioxide would move when the gas is pumped underground. The Industrial Commission oversees the Department of Mineral Resources, which recommended approving the storage permits. About 92% of landowners have voluntarily agreed to participate in the storage facility.
CO2 storage law challenged in North Dakota Supreme Court hearing

In yet another case, the North Dakota Supreme Court heard arguments last month in a challenge to a state law related to underground storage of CO2.
The Northwest Landowners Association and other landowners contend a state law that can force landowners to take part in an underground CO2 storage project through a process called amalgamation is unconstitutional. Summit Carbon Solutions is taking part in the defense of that law along with the state of North Dakota and the Industrial Commission. An attorney for Minnkota Power, who joined the Industrial Commission in arguing to the Supreme Court, said a small percentage of property owners should not be able to deny a majority the right to develop their property.
Summit’s pipelines are planned to connect 57 ethanol plants, including Tharaldson Ethanol at Casselton, to the underground carbon storage sites.
Summit so far has been denied a permit in South Dakota. It has obtained permits in Iowa and for part of its Minnesota route. Nebraska has no state permitting for carbon pipelines.
Supporters of the Summit project say it would support the ethanol industry by lowering the carbon intensity score of the ethanol plants, opening up potential sales in low-carbon fuel markets.
The project would take advantage of federal tax credits promoting carbon sequestration to combat greenhouse gas emissions.

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)Two foundations in South Dakota’s Black Hills have announced a partnership to support local nonprofits “facing disruptions due to shifts in federal priorities.”
The Rapid City-based Black Hills Area Community Foundation and the John T. Vucurevich Foundation have launched a joint fund, the Sustaining Black Hills Nonprofits Fund, to offer short-term bridge funding. The partnership, also supported by the Bush Foundation in Minnesota, is designed to provide flexible support for nonprofits as they work through changes in their federal support, while encouraging additional community support for nonprofits.


Federal Fallout
Read South Dakota Searchlight’s coverage of Trump administration firings, funding freezes, spending cuts, grant cancellations, tariffs and immigration enforcement.


Many nonprofits are experiencing funding reductions or eliminations since the Trump administration began making widespread cuts in government programs.
Jacqui Dietrich, John T. Vucurevich Foundation president and CEO, said in a news release that “nonprofits are under intense pressure, facing rising costs, increasing demand for their services, and declining federal support.”
“While philanthropy can’t fill every gap, our community can stand together to help sustain critical services through this transition,” Dietrich said.
Chris Huber, Black Hills Area Community Foundation president and CEO, said that without nonprofit services, “our community’s needs don’t go away, they go unmet.”
The partnership has already provided bridge funding to Seventh Circuit Court Appointed Special Advocates, which recently lost $15,000 after the federal government terminated grant awards to the National Court Appointed Special Advocates Association. The program advocates for children in the court system.
Funding has also been provided to Feeding South Dakota and to Working Against Violence Inc., which assists survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault.

As a kid, Jeff Isabelle loved reading about dinosaurs. That grew into a passion for fossils, a love of geology, and a desire to work in the field—which meant going to college. Thanks to his parents’ support and his own hard work, with VSAC’s guidance Jeff will go to Norwich with financial aid and scholarships.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Scholarship s[...]","Jeff Isabelle of Barre grew up reading books about dinosaurs. “I’ve been fascinated with paleontology for as long as I can remember. I always hunted for fossils in my spare time, and I’ve found some pretty cool things.” On a vacation to Washington, DC, the family took a side trip to Maryland’s Calvert Cliffs State Park, where Jeff found a bryozoan—an ancient aquatic animal that lived over 500 million years ago. While his longtime hobby connects him to the earth’s distant past, Jeff has also kept his focus strongly on the future throughout his time at Spaulding High School in Barre. Hoping he could go on to college, he worked hard from day one to keep up his grades, and he participated in the VSAC TRIO Talent Search program, a federally funded initiative to help students from modest-income backgrounds apply to and pay for college. Chelsea Martin, one of VSAC’s outreach counselors, worked with Jeff for three years. “Jeff exemplifies TRIO Talent Search. He is a first-generation, modest-income student who put so much work into his academic career to continue pursuing his passion.”This fall, Jeff will study geology at Norwich University. By March, Jeff had earned enough in scholarship awards to cover two-thirds of his college costs. Then, in mid-April, he learned he had won the prestigious Ronald York Scholarship from Spaulding, which further reduced his annual expenses, as long as he maintains a certain grade point average for all four years.“Without Chelsea, I wouldn’t have gotten half of that,” says Jeff—a claim Chelsea Martin pushes back on. “Jeff is one of the hardest workers I know, not only in academics, but outside of school as well.” While Jeff is modest about his achievements, he’s quick to credit hard work, VSAC’s guidance, and his parents’ support for helping him achieve his college dream. “I always wanted to go to college, but to be honest, I wasn’t sure I would be able to,” he says. “I always worked my hardest in school, but I worried I wouldn’t get there. VSAC helped me out a lot by pointing me to schools I could apply to and ways to make college less expensive. And my parents were always right there by my side.”  Jeff’s mom and dad both completed some college courses and understood the importance of education. His two older sisters, ages 28 and 29, both worked with VSAC programs in high school and went on to college and successful careers. His sister Kayla lives in Florida, where she tests soils for contaminants—something Jeff sees as a possible career path—and his other sister Christy lives in New Hampshire and works in cybersecurity.Jeff and his parents homed in on ways to reduce the cost of college tuition. They attended VSAC’s Scholarship Night, where VSAC counselors help students and families set up scholarship applications and navigate online programs. “They showed us how to get through those websites, both during the group presentations and one-on-one.”Jeff says he felt overwhelmed by the number of scholarships available. “It takes a lot of time, and writing essays isn’t easy. But in the end, it is worth it. Even if you don’t get the scholarship, it’s still a good experience.” His search for schools that had dedicated geology programs—which is becoming somewhat of a rare find—led him to Norwich. Other schools on his list offered a major in environmental studies, but Jeff liked the fact that Norwich’s geology program includes weekly trips out into the field, something he knows he wants to do once he starts working. While Jeff’s passion is in earth sciences, some of his favorite courses at Spaulding were in English and history. “I enjoyed classes on graphic novels, medieval studies, and marine biology, and I liked PE, too. Usually the more advanced something was, the more interesting it was.” He also participated in several clubs, including French Club; the SAFE Club, focusing on environmental action; and his favorite, the rock wall climbing club. “That was wicked fun,” he says with a smile.After graduation in mid-June, Jeff plans to return to his usual summer job, doing trimming and maintenance at three local cemeteries, including Barre’s renowned Hope Cemetery. It’s hard work, something Jeff doesn’t shy away from. In fact, having a strong work ethic is Jeff’s advice for those coming up behind him. “Better grades mean better deals for college, so you want to try your best, starting freshman year,” he says. He also encourages students to ask to re-take tests or assessments if they think they can improve their scores—an opportunity he used to his advantage. But hard work is only part of the story. “I’m thankful for my family, especially my mother, who helped me out so much with all the paperwork. I couldn’t have done this alone.”The Vermont Student Assistance Corp. was created by the Vermont Legislature in 1965 as a public nonprofit agency. We advocate for Vermont students and their families to ensure that they have the tools they need to achieve their education and training goals.

StebbinsMichigan’s mandatory 24-hour waiting period for receiving abortions has been struck down after a Michigan Court of Claims judge determined Tuesday that the rule was unconstitutional.
Michigan voters enshrined the right to an abortion and “reproductive freedom for all” into the state constitution in the November 2022 election through a ballot measure. In February 2024, abortion rights groups filed a lawsuit challenging several of Michigan’s provisions around abortion access, asserting that they work against Michiganders’ new constitutional rights.
In addition to the mandatory 24-hour waiting period, Michigan Court of Claims Judge Sima Patel struck down requirements surrounding mandatory counseling that required abortion providers to provide an image of a fetus to patients receiving abortions. Another stricken rule had barred nurse practitioners, certified nurse midwives and physician assistants from performing abortions
However, Patel upheld a rule that requires abortion providers to screen for signs of coercion, saying the rule does not violate the constitutional right to reproductive health care.
Michigan voters OK abortion, voting rights and term limits proposals 

“The interest to be protected in this case is the fundamental right to reproductive freedom. The Court has deemed the majority of the provisions in the challenged laws to unconstitutionally burden and infringe upon that right,” Patel wrote in her opinion Tuesday.
Striking down the 24-hour waiting period has been a top priority for abortion access advocates, as Planned Parenthood of Michigan reported in 2023, when lawmakers were considering a repeal, that the rule causes around 150 patients to cancel their appointments each month due to difficulty scheduling with work, transportation or other reasons.
Plaintiffs arguing for the repeal in the case argued that the waiting period does nothing to promote patient health or protect against coercion into getting an abortion. Instead, proponents for the repeal argued that the waiting period works to ensure it becomes more difficult, logistically and medically, to receive quality abortion care earlier in a pregnancy.
“…the Court finds that the mandatory 24-hour waiting period burdens and infringes upon patients’ rights to reproductive freedom,” Patel wrote in her opinion Tuesday. “The mandatory delay exacerbates the burdens that patients experience seeking abortion care, including by increasing costs, prolonging wait times, increasing the risk that a patient will have to disclose their decision to others, and potentially forcing the patient to forgo a medication abortion for a more invasive procedure.”
Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, a staunch supporter of abortion rights, has long supported eliminating the state’s waiting period placed on abortions, saying in a statement Tuesday that the court’s decision recognizes the struck down provisions as burdensome and obstructive to abortion care.
“This ruling affirms what Michiganders made clear when they voted to enshrine a fundamental right to reproductive freedom in our state constitution: that deeply personal medical decisions belong to individuals and their providers,” Nessel said. “I will continue fighting to defend reproductive freedoms and protect bodily autonomy for Michigan residents.”
Meanwhile, Right to Life of Michigan President Amber Roseboom said in a statement that the court’s decision endangers womens’ ability to make informed and safe medical decisions for themselves.
“Abortion is the only medical procedure of its kind in which the patient now is expected to go in blind,” Roseboom said in a statement. “There is no question that women are at greater risk when they enter an abortion clinic in Michigan today than they were even a few years ago.”
Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who championed the effort to remove the barriers, said the ruling “reaffirms that Michigan is a state where you can make your own decisions about your own body with a trusted health care provider, without political interference.”

(Screenshot of livestream)The Indiana Parole Board rejected a clemency plea from Benjamin Ritchie, recommending that Gov. Mike Braun allow the death row inmate’s May 20 execution to proceed as scheduled.
Ritchie, who fatally shot Beech Grove law enforcement officer William Toney during a police pursuit on Sept. 29, 2000, had petitioned the board to commute his death sentence to life without parole. 
In a letter dated Tuesday, board chairwoman Gwen Horth said the five-member panel had reviewed Ritchie’s application, including “a vast amount of testimony and evidence” regarding his recent diagnosis of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Disorder (FASD), as well as his history of childhood abuse and neglect, and his conduct while incarcerated.

The board also considered the testimony of Toney’s family and friends that was provided during a two-hour public hearing on Monday. 
Horth said the board ultimately found that Ritchie’s request for clemency “does not rise to the level of requiring a commutation of his death sentence.”
She did not say in her letter to Braun if all board members agreed. Unlike in other clemency cases, the board did not take a public vote before issuing its decision.
Annie Goeller, a DOC spokesperson, told the Indiana Capital Chronicle that the parole board “decided to make a unanimous recommendation.”
A spokesperson for the governor’s office said Wednesday that Braun “is reviewing the recommendation.”
“By all accounts, Bill Toney was a loving husband, father, and friend as well as a devoted public servant who genuinely tried to do what was best for his community of Beech Grove,” Horth wrote on behalf of the board. She noted that Toney left behind a wife, two young daughters — aged 4 and 18 months — and many close friends, neighbors and fellow officers.  
“The outcome that those individuals were promised by a jury of Mr. Ritchie’s peers was that Mr. Ritchie would ultimately be put to death for his egregious actions,” Horth continued. “The family and friends of Bill Toney have patiently waited for the day when that sentence would be fulfilled.”
Story continues below.
Ritchie-Recommendation
 
Ritchie, now 45, has been on Indiana’s death row since his 2002 conviction. 
During his first clemency hearing, held at the Indiana State Prison in Michigan City, Ritchie admitted for the first time that he had intentionally fired the fatal shot and left the officer to die.
“Mr. Ritchie himself has given multiple versions of the events that transpired,” Horth wrote. “However, during his hearing on May 5, 2025, Mr. Ritchie did admit to being in a stationary position and intentionally shooting Officer Bill Toney.”
At the time of the shooting, Ritchie was in violation of probation for a prior burglary conviction, Horth noted. His record also included a series of juvenile delinquency findings that led to his incarceration as a minor.
And although some former corrections officers praised Ritchie’s behavior, the parole board’s review emphasized that Ritchie has accumulated more than 40 conduct violations during his two decades in prison, some of which involved violent or threatening behavior toward officers and other inmates. 
Advocates for Ritchie argued that his FASD diagnosis — a condition linked to cognitive impairments and behavioral challenges — should disqualify him from capital punishment, especially when combined with his abusive upbringing and lead exposure as a child.
‘A monster running loose in the countryside.’ Clemency hearings end for Indiana death row inmate

Still, Horth said the board believed those factors had already been weighed by judges and juries over the course of years of legal proceedings.
“We find that a vast majority of the information related to Benjamin Ritchie’s history of abuse and neglect, including but not limited to pre-natal alcohol exposure, has been appropriately considered by the fact finders and judicial officers tasked with considering the evidence,” she said in the board’s letter.
A final clemency decision now rests with Braun. The governor can accept the parole board’s recommendation, or elect to commute Ritchie’s death sentence to life imprisonment. There’s no timetable for the governor to issue his opinion.
Without clemency, Ritchie is unlikely to succeed in challenging his death sentence.
The inmate’s lawyers are seeking a last-minute execution pause from the U.S. Supreme Court, in addition to an emergency stay from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana. Both filings are still pending.
The Indiana Supreme Court already denied a stay.
Three clemencies have been granted in Indiana since 1976.
The most recent was in 2005, when then-Gov. Mitch Daniels commuted the death sentence for Arthur Baird, who killed his pregnant wife and her parents in 1985. Although the parole board denied his petition for clemency, Daniels granted Baird clemency one day before the scheduled execution, in part citing questions about Baird’s sanity.

Lovett's controversial bill to erase the property rights inherent in faculty tenure didn't gain traction during the 2025 session of the Kansas Legislature. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Emporia State University general counsel who championed a bill introduced in the Kansas Legislature to abolish property rights inherent in university tenure agreed to leave the state payroll to become a legal consultant to the university.
ESU President Ken Hush said in a campus message that he looked forward to working with Steve Lovett after transitioning to a new role as “third-party legal consultant for the university.” Lovett will be counted on for legal, strategic and leadership services, Hush said.
“We continuously seek opportunities to be innovative and find new ways to create efficiency,” Hush said. “This approach provides flexibility for ESU and reduces overhead costs.”
Lovett played a central role in a controversy that erupted in February when a bill — purportedly introduced without the knowledge of ESU or the Kansas Board of Regents — was filed in the House to retroactively gut tenure rights of nearly 3,000 public university faculty in Kansas.
Lovett’s bill raised red flags because it could have influenced outcome of a lawsuit filed by a group of ESU faculty who were fired in 2022. In a key decision, a federal judge said tenure in Kansas contained a property right. Lovett was listed among defendants in that federal case and his advocacy for the legislation could be viewed as a conflict of interest.
During testimony to a House committee, Lovett said the property right woven into tenure was an “unnecessary impediment” at public universities. Lovett renounced tenure awarded him by ESU as an associate professor.
Blake Flanders, president of the Kansas Board of Regents, said legislative proposals from state universities such as ESU had to be approved by the Board of Regents prior to being submitted to the Legislature. He indicated Lovett’s bill violated Board of Regents’ policy.
The bill was a “surprise to the university” and Lovett lobbied for the legislation as a “private citizen” rather than in his capacity as ESU’s top attorney, a ESU spokeswoman said.
Academic leaders of Kansas State University and University of Kansas argued implementation of Lovett’s bill would lead to an exodus of educators and students, destroy academic research programs and harm the state’s economy.
The office of Attorney General Kris Kobach said $250,000 would be needed in 2026 and 2027 to defend the state against legal challenges if the tenure bill became law. The measure didn’t advance out of a House committee.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Lovett-1b-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-14 11:04:16.000020
,Mississippi Today,2025-05-14 14:45:50+00:00,Mississippi Today,‘Three strikes and you’re out’: Jackson State alums and lawmakers urge transparency with IHL board,Candice Wilder,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/05/14/three-strikes-and-youre-out-jsu-alums-lawmakers-critique-ihl-board/,Graduates and Mississippi lawmakers of the state’s largest historically Black university say they’re frustrated with the college board after JSU's third leadership turnover.,"After Marcus Thompson’s resignation last week, Mississippi lawmakers and Jackson State University alumni are calling for more transparency and accountability from the state’s governing board that oversees and selects its college presidents. 
The Institutions of Higher Learning Board met in a closed door executive meeting for two hours last Wednesday to discuss a personnel matter regarding the job performance of an employee at the state’s largest historically Black university – the second time in three weeks the board did so. After the meeting, board officials told media there was nothing to report. 
IHL later released a statement saying Thompson resigned, but provided no information about what happened or why. Mississippi Today asked for a resignation letter but due to state public record laws it cannot be shared publicly. A spokesperson for the board said in an email statement they requested permission from Thompson to release his letter but the request was denied.

Thompson’s departure officially marks the university’s third leadership turnover in ten years. It was deja vu for many who had watched the board let Thompson’s predecessor, Thomas Hudson, resign two years ago with no public explanation. 
The news came as a disappointment to JSU alumni, including Rep. Chris Bell, D-Jackson. Speaking about the repeated resignations creates a double-bind for JSU alums: It can bring unwanted, negative attention to the university, but staying silent could lead to IHL repeating the same mistakes.
“We got a lot of great things going on at Jackson State University,” Bell told Mississippi Today in a phone call this week. “It just speaks again to the need for transparency and accountability through the presidential selection process and IHL.” 
In 2020, Bell was one of 10 Democrats who introduced a bill to abolish IHL. The bill would have allowed the state’s eight public universities to appoint their own board of trustees to oversee the universities finances and executive leadership. The board is currently appointed by the governor with the advice-and-consent of the Senate.
If established, each 12-member board would include three representatives from the following groups associated with the respective university: members of college alumni association, student government and university faculty senate and state residents to serve a five-year term. It would have also established those boards to keep a detailed history of meeting minutes and vote history of potential candidates. 
The bill was tripled-referred, a rare legislative tactic used by House Speaker Philip Gunn at the time, to ensure the bill’s death. 
A dog and pony show
Mississippi Today reached out to Jackson State University National Alumni Association President Patrease Edwards for a comment. 
Leaders of the group did not respond to a request for comment in time for publication but shared a statement with other publications that in part asked alumni to only speak positively about the university. 
Mark Dawson, a lifetime member of JSU National Alumni Association, was one of many who sat on an open panel for the university’s presidential candidate process in spring 2023, which ultimately resulted in Thompson. 
Dawson said it did not seem like IHL took the panel’s feedback into account. Rather than using alumni on these panels as a “dog and pony show,” Dawson said, there’s a need for a “unified approach” for stakeholders and supporters of the university to be more involved in the search — so they can help IHL select a president who will last more than a couple years. 
“It’s about the opportunity to come together and get some things right,” Dawson said. “How can you have a vision for long-term stability for student housing, fundraising, academic programs and a new stadium when you have a new administration every few years. It needs to be corrected.” 
Sen. Derrick T. Simmons Credit: Aallyah Wright, Mississippi Today
State Senate Minority Leader, Derrick T. Simmons said the board’s lack of diversity hurts JSU. The state’s 12-member board currently only includes one alumnus from a Mississippi HBCU. While the state’s population is majority African-American, JSU and other universities play a pivotal role in educating Black professionals, many of whom are Mississippi natives, Simmons added. 
“This underrepresentation raises concerns about equitable decision-making and inclusivity,” Simmons said. “By embracing these principles, the IHL can better serve all Mississippians, uphold the legacy of its educational institutions, and ensure a more equitable future for higher education in the state.” 
Sen. Hillman Frazier, D-Jackson, said he doesn’t have confidence with IHL when it comes to selecting the university’s presidents. In the last three presidential processes, the board has continued to overlook recommended resumes, stakeholders and supporters choices for president. 

Sen. Hillman Frazier, D-Jackson, is a JSU alumnus
Hudson’s predecessor, William Bynum, was gone after three years following his arrest in a prostitution sting at a Clinton hotel. Bynum was appointed Jackson State’s president in 2017 after serving as president of Mississippi Valley State University president for about four years.  He was not a popular pick. The board’s announcement of his selection inspired several Black lawmakers to file a lawsuit to prevent his appointment. 
“They’ve wasted taxpayers and the JSU family’s time, energy and resources,” Frazier said. “Three strikes and you’re out. I have no confidence in this board and its commissioner.” 
A spokesperson for the board said the trustees have not held any formal discussions regarding a presidential search for Jackson State University.  
“The Board of Trustees is committed to a clear and transparent process,” a spokesperson for the board said in an email to Mississippi Today. 
IHL hired Thompson in November 2023 after Thomas Hudson. The board had placed Hudson on administrative leave, but did not share with the public the reason for the personnel issue that motivated its decision. 
When the board began its search a few months later, members of the JSU community asked the board to “stop hiring your friends.” The board conducted a national search, interviewing 79 applicants, but Thompson was the epitome of an internal hire having worked at IHL since 2009. 
Moving forward 
Denise Jones Gregory, former provost of vice president of academic affairs at JSU, shared a personal statement  on the university’s social media this weekend. 


“I ask for your patience, your partnership and most of all, your prayers as we move Jackson State University forward together,” Jones-Gregory said. 
Lisa Ross, a Jackson-area employment attorney and JSU alumnus, said IHL needs to better prepare the presidents to lead a complex organization like a university. She would know: Ross has repeatedly sued IHL and JSU on behalf of female administrators and faculty who have alleged gender discrimination in the workplace from male superiors.
Ross, who has sued over Thompson and Hudson’s appointments, noted neither man had led a university before IHL selected them. 
“It seems like they’re sending these people over there and they’re just letting these people go,” she said. “I don’t know if they gave Marcus the support that he needed.”
Ross cited something Thompson told her soon after he became president, that he had never read “To Survive and Thrive: The Quest for a True University.”
The memoir recounts John Peoples’ time leading Jackson State amid civil rights demonstrations and the 1970 shooting, as well as his relationships with the IHL board. Peoples is widely regarded as the university’s most renowned president.
“He did tell me ‘oh, I went out and bought the book,’ but you don’t even know the history of the university?” she said.
Going forward, the repeated resignations could make it hard for the state Legislature to invest in the university. It could also lead to a less qualified candidate pool, Frazier added.

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)Several environmental groups declared victory in an ongoing rulemaking process to expand the uses of oil and gas wastewater beyond the oilfields, after the Water Quality Control Commission during a Tuesday hearing reversed its position to allow releases into the environment.
“We’re so delighted that the commission took their responsibility so seriously and applied science and applied the law,” New Energy Economy Executive Director Mariel Nanasi told Source NM after the meeting. “There’s no evidence that produced water can be treated and reused safely; without knowing what needs to be removed from produced water, it is impossible to develop treatment standards or assure the public that discharges will be safe.”
The substantial shift comes just 10 days before the WQCC has to issue a final decision in the yearslong and controversial effort to treat and potentially reuse oil and gas wastewater.
The process began in December 2023 when the New Mexico Environment Department petitioned the commission to adopt rules to expand reuse beyond oilfields. That process included weeks of testimony in 2024 from scientists, water experts, environmental officials and industry representatives.
Scientists project that drought and warming temperatures from human-caused climate change will reduce New Mexico’s water supplies by 25% in the next three decades, and place more strain on rivers and aquifers. For the past several years, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has proposed a so-called Strategic Water Supply that would treat and use oil and gas wastewater to compensate for those losses. However, lawmakers in the most recent legislative session stripped produced water from the final bill. Opposing water and conservation groups said treatment technology for the water remains unproven and the waste poses harm to human and environmental health.
The New Mexico oil and gas industry generates billions of gallons of wastewater. The mixture is extremely salty and can contain radioactive materials, heavy metals, toxic chemicals and cancer-causing compounds from the oil and gas, such as benzene.
The reversal
In April, the commission adopted a draft version of the rule that would allow pilot projects using oil and gas wastewater to discharge up to 84,000 gallons per day into groundwater.
Environmental groups New Energy Economy, WildEarth Guardians, Amigos Bravos and the Sierra Club submitted several arguments that the decision violated existing laws; was not based on previous testimony; and potentially threatened human and ecological health. More than two dozen Democratic lawmakers also weighed in last week, urging the Water Quality Control Commission to reconsider.
Lawmakers urge water board to reconsider produced water rule

On Tuesday, WQCC members acceded to those arguments.
“At this point, I believe it’s premature for us to authorize discharge permits, even for pilot projects,” said Commissioner Bill Brancard during deliberations.
Commissioners did not allow attorneys for the environmental groups, nor ones for the oil and gas industry, to make oral arguments on Tuesday, but instead deliberated for several hours. The vote was unanimous, although two commissioners abstained, saying they had not been present for testimony in 2024, did not feel informed enough to cast a vote.
About 30 people attended the Roundhouse hearing, displaying signs stating “No discharge of fracking waste” and “Water is life,” prompting warnings from two Sergeants at Arms to keep signs outside the meeting room. When commissioners voted to strike discharges from the rules, attendees applauded.
“Fracking waste is by no matter a light concern,” Ennedith López, a policy campaign manager at Youth United for Climate Crisis Action (YUCCA), told Source before the vote. “It’s radioactive wastewater that they want to use potentially for agriculture projects for construction and development, and that comes at the harm of people’s health.”
Commissioners also determined that state law mandates that using produced water would most likely require a permit, which would be more stringent than the process in the draft rule.

At one point, commissioners floated scrapping the entire process, which would send the New Mexico Environment Department back to the drawing board, but decided instead to add language requiring pilot projects to seek permits.
Deliberations Wednesday will include more information about what information pilot projects would need to require for permitting, and if the rule needs to be revisited in the future.
Attorneys for New Mexico Oil and Gas Association, which is also party to the rulemaking, declined to comment Tuesday.
Produced water proponents said they were disappointed with the commission’s decision Tuesday.
Restrictions on discharges will push produced water treatment to Texas, said Mike Hightower, the program director at the Produced Water Consortium, a private-public research group.
‘With no discharge, all the companies that want to discharge the water for beneficial use: agriculture, surface water, putting water in Pecos for ecological flows, can’t do that here, so they’ll go to Texas” Hightower said.
He also said a permitting process would increase the time needed for approval on pilot projects.
“Nobody’s going to do a small pilot project that takes a year and a half to get permitted when they can go to Texas and get it with no permit or a permit that takes a couple of weeks,” Hightower said.

A former middle school principal in Delaware has been indicted on multiple felony charges, including rape and child sexual abuse, following allegations she assaulted a minor over several years while holding a position of authority.
Tasha Purnell, who was known professionally as Tasha Oliver during her time as principal at Alexis I. du Pont Middle School in Wilmington, was indicted in August on 19 felony counts.
The charges include third- and fourth-degree rape, continuous sexual abuse of a child, and sexual abuse of a child by a person in a position of trust.
Court documents allege that between August 2010 and July 2014, Purnell abused a female victim—identified in legal documents only as D.B.—while serving as a teacher at Stanton Middle School in New Castle County.
The victim was under the age of 16 at the time.
Purnell, 43, became principal at Alexis I. du Pont Middle School in January 2020. She went on administrative leave in September 2023. and the assistant principal stepped in to lead the school.
Purnell was officially terminated a year later, but records show she continued to receive her full $142,000 salary during that time.
As of now, school district officials have not responded to requests for comment.
Purnell taught at Stanton Middle School from 2006 to 2016, the same period during which the abuse allegedly occurred. Her indictment marks a rare and serious case involving a high-ranking school official in the state’s education system.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/tasha-oliver.webp,,,2025-05-14 11:04:16.000020

Jared Polis to sign Senate Bill 25-5, the Worker Protection Act on Tuesday. (Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)Colorado labor unions rallied outside the governor’s residence in Denver on Tuesday, making one last appeal to Democratic Gov. Jared Polis to sign into law a bill passed by the Legislature to repeal a unique obstacle in state law for workers seeking to form a union.
“There is broad support for this from every corner of the state and everywhere in between,” state Sen. Jessie Danielson, a Wheat Ridge Democrat and sponsor of Senate Bill 25-5, told a crowd of a few dozen advocates in Governor’s Park. “The public wants it. The workers need it. It’s the right thing to do, and the time is now. Gov. Polis, sign the Worker Protection Act into law.”
But Polis is expected to veto the measure, siding with business groups who want to preserve the state’s 80-year-old Labor Peace Act. Under that law, Colorado workers organizing a union must hold a second election and obtain 75% approval to determine if workers who don’t support the union would have to pay representation fees, a modified version of the so-called “right to work” rules enacted by many conservative states.

With a veto expected, supporters of SB-5 are instead turning their attention to the ballot box, where they hope to make gains on a different policy front in 2026. Initiative 43, a proposed ballot measure filed earlier this year, would require “just cause” for employee terminations, a significant change to the state’s at-will employment laws.
The measure would require private-sector employers to provide notice of 1 of 7 causes for termination, including willful misconduct, gross insubordination or “specific economic circumstances that directly and adversely affect the employer.” Fired employees who don’t believe their terminations met the just-cause criteria could file civil actions in state court seeking reinstatement or other relief.










The public wants it. The workers need it. It's the right thing to do, and the time is now. Gov. Polis, sign the Worker Protection Act into law.


– State Sen. Jessie Danielson


The initiative was approved for circulation by the state’s Title Board last month, and advocates began gathering petition signatures at Tuesday’s rally. To qualify for the 2026 ballot, the campaign will need to submit at least 124,238 valid signatures from registered Colorado voters before an Oct. 24 deadline. As a statutory measure, it would become law with a simple majority vote.
The Colorado AFL-CIO, Service Employees International Union Local 105 and United Food and Commercial Workers Local 7 are among the unions backing Initiative 43.
“At a moment when the nation has recognized that corporate billionaires are rigging the system against us, Coloradans came together to build solidarity, worker power and a fairer vision for our future,” Kim Cordova, president of UFCW Local 7, said in a statement. “This legislative session was the opportunity Colorado’s labor movement needed to build the power needed to pass pro-worker policies, whether through legislation or at the ballot.”

Chris Deluzio announces his intention to seek a second term during an event in Collier Township on Tuesday, Jan. 23, 2024. (Steve Mellon/For the Penn Capital-Star)U.S. Rep. Chris Deluzio’s (D-Allegheny) successful reelection campaign was one of the lone bright spots for Pennsylvania Democrats in 2024. Republicans in the Keystone State carried the commonwealth’s 19 electoral votes which helped propel Donald Trump back into the White House; Dave McCormick unseated the longest serving Democratic senator in Pennsylvania history, Bob Casey; GOP candidates won all three state row offices (attorney general, auditor general, and treasurer), and flipped two U.S. House seats in the process. However, Deluzio’s victory in a battleground district over GOP state Rep. Rob Mercuri earned him a second term.
He represents a purple region in western Pennsylvania and penned an op-ed in the New York Times in March saying “anti-tariff absolutism is a mistake.” Deluzio recently joined U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders to speak at rallies in Harrisburg and Bethlehem along the Vermont Independent’s “Fighting Oligarchy” tour, and NBC News reports that he’s viewed “as someone who could be a future statewide candidate” in Pennsylvania.
As Democrats continue to chart a path forward to better connect with voters, Deluzio spoke with the Pennsylvania Capital-Star about President Donald Trump’s tariff policies, focusing on economic populism, joining the “Monopoly Busters” caucus, and more. 
This interview was edited for length and clarity:
Capital-Star: ​​In November, you were elected to serve your second term in Congress. What are your priorities for this session?
Deluzio: Well, I think we still have a big opportunity to pass my Railway Safety Act and get rail safety done. 
This is, I think, an urgent priority for so many of my constituents and people like us who live close to the tracks.
And I always bring out this point: I think my Railway Safety Act may have been the only bill that Joe Biden and Donald Trump both agreed about and supported as they were running for president.
Senator Vance was even one of my co-sponsors in the Senate.
So, I think it’s something we can get done.
I also want to be clear, the railroads continue to lobby hard against rail safety efforts.
There’s reporting, even this last week, that they are pushing the Trump administration to roll back the two person minimum staffing requirement that the Biden administration had put out.
And so, I highlight that to make the point that the powerful railroads do not want to see us succeed to get rail safety passed.
I think we’ve got to do it to keep us safer from derailments like East Palestine.
  A Norfolk Southern Railway train derailed in East Palestine, a town of nearly 5,000 residents, on Feb. 3, 2023, leading to the release of dangerous chemicals through a controlled burn to prevent an explosion. It forced residents to evacuate the area. A bill that includes tax exemptions for relief payments related to the disaster passed the U.S. House with bipartisan support. (Photo courtesy of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency)
I also get to a problem I see that is bigger than just one bill.
I’m 40 years old, so people my age, around my age, and younger, you know, we’re the first Americans, really, since the Second World War, that the data says you shouldn’t expect to be better off than your parents and that’s really unacceptable to me.
I think that goes to the heart of the American dream.
I think corruption has had such a big impact on why you have such a corporate stranglehold in our economy, why growth struggles, why people can’t make ends meet.
And so, I want to take on that corruption, I’ve been working on congressional stock trading bans.
I’ve got a whole defend democracy agenda around combating corruption, so I’m really going to keep pushing on that. I think it’s such a major problem, not just for our economy, but for people’s trust in our government.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Capital-Star: President Donald Trump’s tariff policies have played a significant role in his second term, thus far. I know most Democrats have been vocal against Trump’s tariffs policy. I know you’ve criticized it at points in time as well, but you did pen an op-ed in the New York Times saying that it was time for Democrats to “rethink our stance on tariffs.” 
So I want to ask you, do you think Democrats are making a mistake in how they’ve talked about tariffs during Trump’s second term thus far?
Deluzio: I think the Trump tariffs have been really bad and hurtful to American workers and industry, and I think Democrats have been nearly unanimous in condemning them. 
And you’ve heard from so many in the business world about how harmful they have been.
What I’d like to see is a strong Democratic alternative that yes, will include some targeted enforcement.
I’m thinking strategic sectors like ship building or steel against trade cheats like China, paired with real and meaningful industrial policy here at home. That means incentivizing companies to bring that production back home, to incentivize investment from friendly countries to invest here in America and American assembly lines, and you’ve got to be focused on parts of the economy where there is a national security impact: semiconductor chips was a good example. But we should be thinking about that for steel, for ship building, and any other sector where we need a strong industrial base.
I serve on the Armed Services Committee. I will tell you there is round agreement and concern about our defense industrial base’s ability to ramp up, if, God forbid, we’re ever in another major war.
And so these issues of our manufacturing power are not just some academic debates. They have real consequences for our military readiness, and of course, I always connect the dots between what happened in places like western Pennsylvania, whether you’re talking about glass manufacturing in the A-K Valley, steelmaking all along the Ohio River in my district.
Trade really hurt communities, like many that I represent, and I don’t ever want to see us go back to just a race to the bottom. We’ve got to get this right for American workers and American jobs. 
Capital-Star: Earlier this month, you joined U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders for two of his appearances on his “Fighting Oligarchy” tour in Pennsylvania. So, why did you decide to join him for those events that were outside of your district?
Deluzio: I think what you’re seeing is a lot of frustration with some Republican members of Congress. Scott Perry’s district was one in particular, I joined, for their willingness to push these dangerous and harmful cuts to Medicaid to support this Republican, partisan tax bill that would saddle all of us with trillions of deficit spending and balloon the debt.
And I think it’s important.
Folks are pretty fired up across the country.
They’re mad about this corruption that I see in our government, and whether it’s congressional stock trading or the outsized influence of corporate money in our politics. They want something to change.
And I made the point talking at both of these rallies that whether you call the folks who are running the show oligarchs or robber barons, or, as I might say in western Pennsylvania, corporate jagoffs. We know who we’re talking about and their control of our political system.
That’s not a problem just for one party or one candidate. I think you have to confront this for the sake of American democracy and I’m going to go wherever I can at the means we’re going to rebuild trust in our government, and if we’re going to fix our economy, so that people who work hard can get by.
And to me, that is about making sure that hard working people have a bigger share of the pie and that we can also grow the pie.

Capital-Star: Do you think Democrats should be embracing more of the message from Senator Sanders or someone like Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez right now?
Deluzio: I think the message that I put up on that stage both nights, which was about fighting oligarchy and fighting corruption, is a winning one. 
It is grounded in patriotism. It is grounded in a belief that if you work hard and play by the rules, you ought to have a shot at the American dream, and we’ve got to unrig our economy, so that it works for folks.
That is a message that is not just good politics, but it’s grounded in policies that people want, that we know can work to get more competition in our economy to make it so that people who are working hard can afford their life.
I think that’s where my party should go.
Capital-Star: Although I was unable to cover your appearance with Senator Sanders in both Bethlehem and Harrisburg, I did cover Senator Sanders’ appearance in Philadelphia on May Day. He spoke at a rally led by the Philadelphia AFL-CIO, and during that speech, he had an interesting quote, and I wanted to ask you about it. He said “to my Democratic colleagues in the Congress, stop defending the status quo economically.” 
Do you think Democrats have been defending the status quo economically?
Deluzio: I certainly haven’t, because I know, and I think my constituents know that things haven’t been working out as well as we should demand that they do.
If you’re my age or younger, right? So, you’re either (in your) early 40s, 30s, 20s, the data suggests you probably won’t be better off than your parents.
We should never accept that, and we should be clear about the fact that people who are working hard right now struggle to pay for child care, pay for housing, pay for health care, you name it.
And we’ve got big corporate monopolies who have made it too hard for small businesses to compete.
None of that should be the status quo we accept, especially when we’ve lived now through years of supply chain problems and rising prices for people.
So no, I don’t accept that and I think we have to be clear to connect the dots between those economic problems and the corruption in Washington.
And I talk to my constituents, Democrats or Republicans, they hate the corruption that they sense, and congressional stock trading is part of it. I think the Trump administration’s willingness to do things like accept a new massive jumbo jet from a foreign government is about this kind of corruption, and so people don’t like it, and they shouldn’t like it.
They should be mad about the state of our economy, and they should want better and I think they do.
And whether you’re Democrat or Republican, we should be willing to be clear about who’s causing these problems and what we’re doing about it.

Capital-Star: Last month, you joined a few of your colleagues in launching the Monopoly Busters Caucus. So, I wanted to ask you, why did you decide to join this caucus?
Deluzio: Well, I think we’ve seen the lack of competition really hurt American capitalism.
It’s bad for workers. It’s bad for rising prices, and it’s really bad for small businesses.
So, I was really honored that I had a couple small business owners join me, a father-son team that runs an independent pharmacy in Aspinwall in Allegheny County, and they shared how their small business really has gotten squeezed by pharmacy benefit managers or PBMs, who are essentially middlemen with lots of power in the healthcare economy. They’re vertically integrated, and they really have led to these independent small business pharmacies closing and dying across Pennsylvania and across the country.
They’ve made things worse for people who need the prescription drugs, costs are rising, as we know, and so I think it’s really important that you heard from someone like that.
These are small business owners who deliver a really critical service, especially to seniors, to get prescription drugs to folks, and how monopoly power is hurting their business, and really how it’s hurting all of us in Pennsylvania.
Capital-Star: A Fox News national poll and a Reuters poll released last week, but conducted in late April, showed that President Donald Trump’s approval rating was 11 points underwater. However, Democrats in that same Fox poll… that the Democrats’ approval rating was also double digits in the red.
So, how do you think the national Democratic Party has arrived at this point? And what do you think they can do to essentially boost those numbers, even though, again, President Donald Trump’s approval rating right now is also in the red?
Deluzio: I’ve been with colleagues of mine in the House, pushing forward what we’re calling economic populism, or economic patriotism, which to me, ties together these fights against corruption and this fight to restore the American Dream. 
I think it’s where we got to go.
It has to put the economic fight right at the heart of what my party is about.
It’s got to be unrigging the economy, taking on this corruption, and doing the things in our government to get competition and to make it so that when you’re working hard, you can actually afford your life in America. And if you’re working hard, you’re playing by the rules, you got your shot at the American dream.
I think that’s where my party has to go.
And I think the corruption problem – I talk about congressional stock trading a lot: it is not unique to either party. I think I want to see Democrats be crystal clear about fighting it and fighting the horrible influence of unlimited corporate money in our politics.
I think too many have cozied up over the years for that corporate money. It’s time to break that hold on our politics and be bold about it.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/20240124smDeluzio04-1024x612.jpg,,,2025-05-14 11:04:16.000020

(Photo: Brian Brachel/IPR)This coverage is made possible through a partnership between IPR and Grist, a nonprofit environmental media organization.
Wooden debris still blankets swaths of northern Michigan hit by this spring’s ice storm.
State Rep. Parker Fairbairn (R-Harbor Springs) represents the 107th District, which includes much of that area. Fairbairn is asking the state Department of Natural Resources to lift remaining restrictions on the collection of fuelwood — wood for personal use, like firewood. The changes would allow people to collect as much as they want from roadside areas in state forests.
“Let’s not inhibit people from being able to get firewood and get biofuel to — whether it’s heating their homes or what have you,” Fairbairn said. “Let’s just get these woods cleaned up as fast as possible so we mitigate and lessen the risk of fire in the future,” he added, referring to the amount of debris created by the storm that could dry up and serve as fuel for forest fires.

Forestry meetings this week:
● Emmet Conservation District is hosting a talk about forestry and
recovering from the ice storm on Wednesday, May 14, at 5:30 p.m. at
Pellston High School. Representatives from the local timber industry
will be there as well.
● Otsego Conservation District is holding a similar event on Thursday,
May 15, at 6 p.m. at the E-Free Church at 1649 M-32 in Gaylord.

DNR foresters have issued guidelines for how people should manage different species of trees after the storm. For example, they recommend that people prioritize clearing pine tree debris before June to help control bark beetle populations and the spread of fungal disease, but that they wait to handle oak tree debris until after mid-July to avoid spreading oak wilt, a fatal fungal disease. They also advise using firewood locally rather than transporting it long distances to avoid spreading pests and disease to new places.
The state requires permits to collect wood for personal use in certain areas of state land. Only wood that is dead, fallen and within 200 feet of a road can be taken.
In an April 28 letter, Fairbairn asked the DNR to eliminate the $20 permit fee, the 90-day limit on the permit and the cap on how much wood can be collected, though he didn’t ask for any changes to where that collection can take place.
The DNR’s website says limits on where wood can be gathered are there to protect the forests, help improve soil, provide plant and wildlife habitat and avoid conflicts with the timber industry.
“I think the permit’s still important, but I think we want to maximize the amount of people who are getting them and participating and cleaning up our woods,” Fairbairn said.
Fuelwood is measured in cords, which are stacks 4 feet wide, 4 feet tall and 8 feet long. The DNR has already doubled the amount of wood people can collect in 12 counties hit by the storm, from five cords to 10.
One Michigan State University Extension post from 2012 estimated that most homes use five or six cords per winter for heating, though there’s a lot of variation.
No one from the DNR was available for an interview, though a spokesperson said the department was reviewing Fairbairn’s request and working on a response, though they didn’t know when that would be sent.
Fairbairn co-sponsored a bill to provide $100 million in state disaster funding to the region. The House passed that bill last week. One hope is that it could direct more federal dollars to communities impacted by the storm.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/download-1024x768.webp,,,2025-05-14 11:04:16.000020

Most entry level professionals are only remaining at Eagle Village residential program in Osceola County for 3 to 6 months, president of the facility Cathey Prudhomme told lawmakers in a meeting of the House Child Welfare System, Public Health and Food Security joint committee. While availability at facilities has shrunk in the last decade, youth entering residential facilities are exhibiting more violent and aggressive behavior towards staff. 
“For some of our children, the best gift we give them is a chance to take a break in a safe, secure, healthy environment where they can do the internal work so that they can again re-enter into a community setting,” Prudhomme said. “However, in the past 10 years, we’ve seen a real transition in residential care, and we’ve seen a real decrease in providers for many reasons.”
There have been a few cases of abuse and neglect at child caring facilities that have shone a spotlight at the need for good policies for caring for Michigan’s most vulnerable kids, Prudhomme said, noting the 2020 death of 16-year-old Cornelius Fredericks after several members of staff at the now-closed Lakeside Academy in Kalamazoo restrained the teen on the ground.
But since the state Legislature implemented new rules in 2021 against using restraints on kids at child caring facilities, Prudhomme said children are weaponizing the new policies, destroying tens of thousands of dollars of property and further endangering other residents as staff are not able to appropriately address dangerous behaviors.
Prudhomme said six other child caring facilities would have been interested in speaking at the committee Tuesday, but out of fear of retribution by the state, fear of being shut down, they did not speak up.
A request for comment was sent to the Michigan Department of Health Human Services, but was not returned.
So as it gets more difficult to serve children with high demands of need after they’ve been placed at child caring facilities ill-equipped to address their needs, Prudhomme said Eagle Village, which has been in operation for more than 50 years, is questioning why they continue to try to operate.
Back in 2020, Michigan had around 1,200 bed spaces in residential youth programs, serving children experiencing a range of issues and traumas with the goal of helping them navigate their lives successfully when they leave, Dan Gowdy, President and CEO at Wedgwood Christian Services in West Michigan told lawmakers. As of the start of this month, Gowdy said the state has 423 residential bed spaces.
And as need remains high for residential programs, Gowdy said he worries that kids are being placed at “any place” instead of the “right place” sharing that there’s a young man at his residential facility who has been undergone 40 different placements.
At Wedgewood things are becoming unsustainable, Gowdy said, with assaults perpetrated by youth residents increasing by 64% from the measured timeframe this year, compared to 2024. He said self-injuries amongst youth residents increased by 107% and hospital and police interventions both starkly increased by more than 400%.
“All of this has unintentionally destabilized children who have already been through significant trauma, and also puts extraordinary pressure on facilities’ frontline staff, significantly increasing injuries, burnout and turnover. This further diminishes the capacity to effectively serve the kids with what they need when they need it,” Gowdy said. “All of us…the department… shelters and legislators, I think our goal is to care for and support these kids and families the best we can. We must work together to develop strategies that provide the most effective and transformative services.”

“I believe that this legislation is going to give us the tools that we need to create more accountability for our utilities and maximize every single ratepayer dollar,” said Gov. Maura Healey, at a press conference announcing her new energy affordability legislation in Leominster. 
The post Healey unveils new energy affordability legislation  appeared first[...]","GOV. MAURA HEALEY unveiled a new energy affordability legislation package on Tuesday, which she said will bring down energy costs by more than $10 billion over the next decade, but consumer advocates and environmentalists criticized the plan, saying it didn’t go far enough to rein in energy companies that pass along gas infrastructure costs to consumers. The legislation – which comes in response to a winter with sky-high heating bills across the state – would take a series of steps to bring more energy onto the grid faster and empower the Department of Public Utilities to remove certain charges from energy bills. It would also allow the department to cap the amount of month-to-month bill increases, make changes to streamline the state’s energy efficiency program, and reform the competitive supply market to protect customers from third-party electric suppliers who have come under fire for predatory marketing and major price hikes.  “I believe that this legislation is going to give us the tools that we need to create more accountability for our utilities and maximize every single ratepayer dollar,” said Healey, at a press conference announcing the legislation in Leominster. “We need to make sure that [for] every single dollar that’s paid in … we’re getting the most out of that, and we have to make sure that you’re not stuck paying for corporate investments that don’t help you either.” An unusually cold winter caused heating bills to balloon this winter, and there was an outcry about energy affordability in the state. Funded entirely through surcharges on ratepayers, Mass Save, the state’s energy efficiency program, made up the biggest portion of the rate increase. The legislation follows the energy affordability agenda that Healey announced in March, which gave electric customers a $50 credit on their April bills and sought to bring ratepayers around $6 billion in savings over the next five years. Healey said that the $10 billion in savings over the next 10 years will be in addition to that. Officials also announced a $500 million reduction in the Mass Save budget over the next three years, a move which environmentalists called “short-sighted.” Healey is seeking to expand the state’s authority to procure energy and allow the state to explore adding new nuclear power technologies to the grid at a time when the Trump administration’s tariffs on Canada, a major supplier of hydroelectricity to the United States, have injected uncertainty in the marketplace. This legislation would repeal a 1982 law that mandates that any proposed nuclear facility receive approval through a statewide ballot. “We rely on energy coming in from other places,” said Healey.  “That’s why the solar arrays are important. That’s why wind off our shores is really important. It’s why we’re fighting hard to make sure that we work as Northeast states with Canada to make sure that hydro is flowing. It’s why we, in this legislation, are opening up to new forms [like] nuclear.” Caitlin Peale Sloan of the Conservation Law Foundation said that the bill did not go far enough to tackle the problem of energy affordability. She said that “bolder steps to rein in excessive utility spending on costly infrastructure projects and corporate profits” are necessary. “It doesn’t address arguably the most important cost drivers we’re facing in the energy system,” said Sloan on a LinkedIn post.  Vickash Mohanka, the head of the Massachusetts Sierra Club, said his group wanted to see more limits on expansion of the gas system and curbing of utility companies’ profit margins. “The bill stops short of doing what is needed to deliver on the promise of sustainable, reliable, and affordable energy in Massachusetts,” Mohanka said in a statement. “The current system puts utility profits over the interests of everyday people. That must change. There is no energy reform without addressing reckless overspending and exploitative profit margins.” Kyle Murray, Massachusetts program director at the Acadia Center, a non-profit research and advocacy organization dedicated to combatting climate change, said that he applauds Healey for not compromising the green energy transition in the name of energy affordability. “I appreciate that there are no, what I like to call, ‘false solutions’ in there,” said Murray. “There’s no ‘Hey, let’s pursue a new gas pipeline or at least look at that,’ because we know that probably will do nothing to reduce costs.” The new legislation would reduce the value of net metering credits – credits that solar energy system owners can use to offset their energy costs. The state has one of the highest net metering rates, and this can lead to higher costs of electricity for non-solar customers. This move would affect non-residential solar facilities and save $380 million, according to the Healey administration.  Healey is also proposing to phase out a program – the Alternative Portfolio Standard Program – that provided incentives to businesses and local governments to install “alternative energy systems” that don’t have to be renewable but must contribute to the state’s clean energy goals by increasing energy efficiency. Eligible technologies include air source heat pumps, solar thermal systems, and a system to burn woody biomass like wood pellets. The ending of this program is meant to save ratepayers $870 million over 10 years. Healey’s new legislation also seeks to reduce administrative costs and streamline the program administration for Mass Save. It would allow the DPU to authorize utility companies to issue bonds to fund part of the program.  Earlier this month, the DPU ordered utility companies to spend less money from ratepayer bills on repairing natural gas infrastructure through the Gas System Enhancement Plan, or GSEP. The GSEP program allows utility companies to submit annual plans to gas pipeline infrastructure and recover the costs through ratepayers, which the DPU then approves. The program was created to encourage utility companies to fix aging or leaky gas pipes but it has led to “exorbitant costs for ratepayers” as spending for the program has increased by an average of 12 percent every year since 2015, according to the Attorney General’s office.  The DPU’s order reduces the amount of money that utilities can spend every year, institutes a more rigorous oversight process to prioritize more severe gas leaks, and creates incentives for non-pipeline alternatives like installing electric heat pumps. The agency said that this should save ratepayers money.  The post Healey unveils new energy affordability legislation  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Healey-State-of-the-Commonwealth-2025-SHNS.jpg?fit=1024%2C665&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-14 10:09:34.099961

(Lexi Browning | West Virginia Watch)A group representing children suing the state of West Virginia over its troubled foster care system wants the lawsuit revived after a judge tossed the case in February. 
A Better Childhood, a nonprofit legal advocacy group based in New York, is also seeking a new judge to preside over the class-action lawsuit, according to a filing on Tuesday.
“We’re asking to get the decision reversed, and we’re asking to get the judge off the case,” said Marcia Lowry, the organization’s executive director. “We continue to think this is a very serious and unconstitutional situation.”
The 2019 lawsuit brought by foster children sought to address pervasive issues in West Virginia’s overburdened child welfare system, including a shortage of Child Protective Services workers and safe homes for children. Kids were left to linger in the system for years with no plans for permanent homes or ending up in abusive group homes, the lawsuit said. 
In his dismissal of the case, U.S. District Judge Joseph R. Goodwin didn’t deny problems still persist, but said the situation couldn’t be fixed through the courts. “This court cannot take over the foster care system of West Virginia,” Goodwin wrote in an opinion dismissing the case, adding that it was an “unsatisfying result” to years of litigation. 
“I know that there are children who deeply suffer in the custody of the state,” he continued. “West Virginia’s foster care system has cycled through inaction, bureaucratic indifference, shocking neglect and temporary fixes for years. The blame squarely lies with West Virginia state government.”
Lowry said that Goodwin failed to rule on underlying issues in the system and has “firmly-held beliefs against institutional reform litigation.”
“The first thing he’s supposed to do is decide liability. This judge has made it clear that he does not think that, regardless that there are serious problems in the system, he still can get relief. In our view, that is wrong,” she said. “In the interest of justice and fairness, we think the case should go to a judge that doesn’t have such firmly-held beliefs.”
Additionally, Lowry believes the suit should continue, saying a court ruling in the case is likely to address children’s needs. The lawsuit asks the courts to mandate that the Department of Human Services place children in safe homes or facilities, receive necessary services and more. They’re also asking for an outside monitor to “conduct record reviews as necessary to ensure compliance.”
“No doubt, institutional reform of a state agency is a daunting and arduous task,” the filing reads. “Federal courts have a constitutional duty to confront that task, not to shy away from it.”
Shafer and Shafer, a West Virginia-based law firm, and Disability Rights West Virginia are also plaintiffs in the case. 
DoHS did not immediately return a request for comment. Prior to Godowin’s dismissal order, the agency sought to have the case thrown out, citing improvements to the system that included hiring more CPS workers. 
The lawsuit was previously thrown out in 2021 then revived by an appeals court in 2022. 
In 2023, U.S. District Judge Thomas E. Johnston recused himself from the case after Mountain State Spotlight, a nonprofit newsroom, pointed out ethical concerns regarding Johnston’s communication with lawmakers and the former Department of Health and Human Resources about legislation impacting foster care and possibly the lawsuit. 
Public information available through the State Auditor’s website shows that DoHS has paid more than $8 million to Brown and Peisch, a law firm in Washington, D.C. that has provided the state’s legal counsel in the case since 2020.

(Courtesy of South Dakota Housing Development Authority)The price of homes built by South Dakota inmates and sold to income-eligible residents across the state will increase again this year.
The South Dakota Housing Development Authority Board voted unanimously Tuesday in Pierre to increase the prices for Governor’s Houses, which are constructed at Mike Durfee State Prison in Springfield and shipped across the state to eligible buyers. 
There are two- and three-bedroom homes, as well as multi-family “DakotaPlex” options for towns with 5,000 people or fewer, and day care models. 
Homebuyers can purchase a Governor’s House if they have an income of $71,540 or less for a one- or two-person household, or $81,760 for households of three or more. Developers can buy and place the homes, as well, if they’re later sold to people who fall within the income guidelines.
Buyers are responsible for finding a lot, getting a building permit, buying appliances, laying flooring and hooking up utilities.


Prices have crept up since 2020, when a buyer could get a two-bedroom Governor’s House for $50,200. Most of this year’s increases align with the program’s income limit increase, said Mike Harsma, who heads the Governor’s House program for South Dakota Housing. The income limits were raised by just over 10%.
On July 1, the start of the 2025 fiscal year, the homes will be priced as follows:

Two bedroom: $86,000, up from $75,900, or a 13.3% increase.
Three bedroom: $96,000, up from $89,900, or a 6.8% increase.
Dakotaplex two bedroom: $97,000, up from $89,900, or a 7.9% increase.
Dakotaplex three bedroom: $106,000, up from $99,900, or a 6.1% increase.
Day care: $96,000, up from $89,900, or a 6.8% increase.

The increasing cost of materials continues to contribute to home prices, Harsma added. 
Harsma told the board that the authority is on track to sell about 120 units this fiscal year, selling 91 through the end of April – most of which were three-bedroom units. The authority typically sells less than five two-bedroom units a year, said Executive Director Chas Olson.

A “handful” of the program’s 58 building pads in Springfield can only accommodate two-bedroom homes, which is part of the reason the authority continues to build and sell homes despite their low interest. Most of the two-bedroom sales are sold as elderly housing, Olson said.
“So we want to still kind of have that option open, but we’ve certainly talked at length about the possibility of cutting that two-bedroom unit,” Olson said.
Harsma also hopes to see an improved lead time. Between 2022 and 2024, it took three years to complete and deliver an order. Harsma told board members the program lowered its lead time to 18 months this winter and “we’re hoping to lower it again as we get further into the summer.”

Chris Van Hollen, North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis, Washington state Democratic Sen. Patty Murray and Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski led drafting the letter in their chamber.Reps. Chuck Edwards, R-N.C.; Sylvia Garcia, D-Texas; Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa.; and Ed Case, D-Hawaii, spearheaded efforts in the House. ‘Beyond reckless’FEMA announced in early April that it would unilaterally cancel all BRIC funding approved from fiscal years 2020 through 2023, calling the program “wasteful and ineffective” in a statement.“Approximately $882 million of funding from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will be returned to the U.S. Treasury or reapportioned by Congress in the next fiscal year,” a FEMA spokesperson wrote in the statement. “The 2021 law made $1 billion available for BRIC over five years, $133 million to date has been provided for about 450 applications. FEMA estimates more than $3.6 billion will remain in the Disaster Relief Fund to assist with disaster response and recovery for communities and survivors.”The National Association of Counties wrote in a post about the cancellation that community leaders may “need to halt work or seek new funding sources” and “delay or scale back infrastructure investments.”“Without access to BRIC’s federal match, counties may find it more difficult to pursue large-scale mitigation projects,” the NaCo post stated.Association of State Floodplain Managers Executive Director Chad Berginnis wrote that dismantling the country’s “largest pre-disaster mitigation program is beyond reckless.”“Cutting funding from projects already underway will leave states and communities scrambling, increasing disaster risk to families and businesses instead of reducing it,” Berginnis wrote. “The impact of this decision will be felt for decades to come.”",,,,2025-05-14 10:09:34.099961

John Sauer argues that those Venezuelans subject to the proclamation must be deported because the migrants “have proven to be especially dangerous to maintain in prolonged detention.""In a Wednesday response, the ACLU warned that if the Supreme Court lifts its injunction, “most of the putative class members will be removed with little chance to seek judicial review.”“And under the government’s position, courts will lack authority to remedy unlawful removals to the CECOT Salvadoran prison, where individuals could be held incommunicado for the remainder of their lives,” according to the ACLU brief.In a separate emergency filing that issued a nationwide injunction that barred the Trump administration from invoking the proclamation, the Supreme Court ruled that, for now, the Trump administration can continue to use the Alien Enemies Act.But the justices unanimously ruled that those who are subject to the wartime law must be given proper due process as enshrined in the U.S. Constitution.Several federal judges have blocked the use of the wartime law in their districts that cover Colorado, Northern and Southern Texas and Southern New York.A federal judge in Western Pennsylvania Tuesday was the first to uphold the Trump administration’s use of the Alien Enemies Act, but said those accused must have at least three weeks to challenge their removal.In court documents, the Trump administration has noted that adequate time for someone to challenge an Alien Enemies Act designation is roughly 12 hours.",,,,2025-05-14 10:09:34.099961

(Photo by Tony Leys/KFF Health News)SPENCER, Iowa — This town’s hospital is a holdout on behalf of people going through mental health crises. The facility’s leaders have pledged not to shutter their inpatient psychiatric unit, as dozens of other U.S. hospitals have.
Keeping that promise could soon get tougher if Congress slashes Medicaid funding. The joint federal-state health program covers an unusually large share of mental health patients, and hospital industry leaders say spending cuts could accelerate a decades-long wave of psychiatric unit closures.
At least eight other Iowa hospitals have stopped offering inpatient mental health care since 2007, forcing people in crisis to seek help in distant facilities. Spencer Hospital is one of the smallest in Iowa still offering the service.
CEO Brenda Tiefenthaler said 40% of her hospital’s psychiatric inpatients are covered by Medicaid, compared with about 12% of all inpatients. An additional 10% of the hospital’s psychiatric inpatients are uninsured. National experts say such disparities are common.
Tiefenthaler vows to keep her nonprofit hospital’s 14-bed psychiatric unit open, even though it loses $2 million per year. That’s a significant loss for an organization with an overall annual budget of about $120 million. But the people who use the psychiatric unit need medical care, “just like people who have chest pains,” Tiefenthaler said.
Medicaid covers health care for about 72 million Americans with low incomes or disabilities. Tiefenthaler predicts that if some of them are kicked off the program and left without insurance coverage, more people would delay treatment for mental health problems until their lives spin out of control.
“Then they’re going to enter through the emergency room when they’re in a crisis,” she said. “That’s not really a solution to what we have going on in our country.”
Republican congressional leaders have vowed to protect Medicaid for people who need it, but they also have called for billions of dollars in cuts to areas of the federal budget that include the program.
The U.S. already faces a deep shortage of inpatient mental health services, many of which were reduced or eliminated by private hospitals and public institutions, said Jennifer Snow, director of government relations and policy for the National Alliance on Mental Illness. At the same time, the number of people experiencing mental problems has climbed.
“I don’t even want to think about how much worse it could get,” she said.
The American Hospital Association estimates nearly 100 U.S. hospitals have shuttered their inpatient mental health services in the past decade.
Such closures are often attributed to mental health services being more likely to lose money than many other types of health care. “I’m not blaming the hospitals,” Snow said. “They need to keep their doors open.”
Medicaid generally pays hospitals lower rates for services than they receive from private insurance or from Medicare, the federal program that mostly covers people 65 or older. And Medicaid recipients are particularly likely to need mental health care. More than a third of nonelderly Medicaid enrollees have some sort of mental illness, according to a report from KFF, a nonprofit health policy organization that includes KFF Health News. Iowa has the highest rate of mental illness among nonelderly Medicaid recipients, at 51%.
As of February, just 20 of Iowa’s 116 community hospitals had inpatient psychiatric units, according to a state registry. Iowa also has four freestanding mental hospitals, including two run by the state.
Iowa, with 3.2 million residents, has a total of about 760 inpatient mental health beds that are staffed to care for patients, the state reports. The Treatment Advocacy Center, a national group seeking improved mental health care, says the “absolute minimum” of such beds would translate to about 960 for Iowa’s population, and the optimal number would be about 1,920.
Most of Iowa’s psychiatric beds are in metro areas, and it can take several days for a slot to come open. In the meantime, patients routinely wait in emergency departments.
Sheriff’s deputies often are assigned to transport patients to available facilities when treatment is court-ordered.
“It’s not uncommon for us to drive five or six hours,” said Clay County Sheriff Chris Raveling, whose northwestern Iowa county includes Spencer, a city of 11,000 people.
He said Spencer Hospital’s mental health unit often is too full to accept new patients and, like many such facilities, it declines to take patients who are violent or charged with crimes.
The result is that people are held in jail on minor charges stemming from their mental illnesses or addictions, the sheriff said. “They really shouldn’t be in jail,” he said. “Did they commit a crime? Yes. But I don’t think they did it on purpose.”
Raveling said authorities in many cases decide to hold people in jail so they don’t hurt themselves or others while awaiting treatment. He has seen the problems worsen in his 25 years in law enforcement.
Most people with mental health issues can be treated as outpatients, but many of those services also depend heavily on Medicaid and could be vulnerable to budget cuts.
Jon Ulven, a psychologist who practices in Moorhead, Minnesota, and neighboring Fargo, North Dakota, said he’s particularly worried about patients who develop psychosis, which often begins in the teenage years or early adulthood. If they’re started right away on medication and therapy, “we can have a dramatic influence on that person for the rest of their life,” he said. But if treatment is delayed, their symptoms often become harder to reverse.
Ulven, who helps oversee mental health services in his region for the multistate Sanford Health system, said he’s also concerned about people with other mental health challenges, including depression. He noted a study published in 2022 that showed suicide rates rose faster in states that declined to expand their Medicaid programs than in states that agreed to expand their programs to cover more low-income adults. If Medicaid rolls are reduced again, he said, more people would be uninsured and fewer services would be available. That could lead to more suicides.
Nationally, Medicaid covered nearly 41% of psychiatric inpatients cared for in 2024 by a sample of 680 hospitals, according to an analysis done for KFF Health News by the financial consulting company Strata. In contrast, just 13% of inpatients in those hospitals’ cancer programs and 9% of inpatients in their cardiac programs were covered by Medicaid.
If Medicaid participants have mental crises after losing their coverage, hospitals or clinics would have to treat many of them for little or no payment. “These are not wealthy people. They don’t have a lot of assets,” said Steve Wasson, Strata’s chief data and intelligence officer. Even though Medicaid pays hospitals relatively low rates, he said, “it’s better than nothing.”
Birthing units, which also have been plagued by closures, face similar challenges. In the Strata sample, 37% of those units’ patients were on Medicaid in 2024.
Spencer Hospital, which has a total of 63 inpatient beds, has maintained both its birthing unit and its psychiatric unit, and its leaders plan to keep them open. Amid a critical shortage of mental health professionals, it employs two psychiatric nurse practitioners and two psychiatrists, including one providing care via video from North Carolina.
Local resident David Jacobsen appreciates the hospital’s efforts to preserve services. His son Alex was assisted by the facility’s mental health professionals during years of struggles before he died by suicide in 2020.
David Jacobsen knows how reliant such services are on Medicaid, and he worries that more hospitals will curtail mental health offerings if national leaders cut the program. “They’re hurting the people who need help the most,” he said.
People on Medicaid aren’t the only ones affected when hospitals reduce services or close treatment units. Everyone in the community loses access to care.
Alex Jacobsen’s family saw how common the need is. “If we can learn anything from my Alex,” one of his sisters wrote in his obituary, “it’s that mental illness is real, it doesn’t discriminate, and it takes some of the best people down in its ugly swirling drain.”

(Image by Lela Seiler, courtesy of CCS Early Learning)Funding for child services in Alaska is unresolved as the Legislature nears the end of its annual session, and a committee will decide how to reconcile very different budget proposals from the House and Senate.
The House of Representatives proposed several significant increases to funding in their version of the operating budget, while the Senate’s proposed budget makes no increases, only providing union-bargained employee salary increases. Negotiations are ongoing for lawmakers to balance a budget in the face of a significant deficit caused by low oil prices.  
Programs affecting the well-being of children were among the differences that must be addressed by a conference committee composed of three members of the Senate and three from the House. 
They’re charged with picking budget amounts from either the House or Senate proposals — or a number in between the two — and bringing them back to each chamber for final approval. While there are roughly 400 budget items that this committee was set to begin to work on Tuesday afternoon, child advocates and some lawmakers are putting a spotlight on four sensitive areas: child advocacy centers, nutrition programs, infant learning and child care.
Centers that serve child victims are under threat
One of those funding items is for child advocacy centers, which provide services for children after suspected physical or sexual abuse. 
The House proposed $5.5 million for 20 child advocacy centers statewide. The Senate proposed no increase.
Advocates say that additional state funding is essential for child advocacy centers to replace federal funding cuts and grants running out in the coming fiscal year, which lasts from July 2025 to June 2026. 
“Alaska’s CACs may soon be in jeopardy due to a dramatic dropoff of federal funds in FY26,” said Mari Mukai, executive director of the Alaska Children’s Alliance, in an email on Monday. “Amounting to $5.5 million or about half of the overall statewide budget. We are asking the State to step in and fill this gap, which would allow the continuation of current service levels.”
The program is currently funded at $10.9 million from a mix of federal grants, local grants, earned income and funding, and no current state funding. 
Child advocacy centers served 2,061 families last year, Mukai noted. “Alaska consistently struggles with some of the nation’s highest rates of child abuse and domestic violence, and Child Advocacy Centers (CACs) are an essential part of the solution.”
The centers provide wraparound services for children and their caregivers after suspected physical or sexual abuse, including trauma-informed interviewing process, forensic services, streamlined investigations and victim advocacy through the life of the case, she said. 
Sen. Jesse Kiehl, D-Juneau, a member of the Senate Finance Committee, agreed that lawmakers should prioritize the program.
“That’s absolutely crucial public safety work. Talk to any police investigator who does these kinds of gut-wrenching cases, and they will tell you just how vital these are. Prosecutors will tell you the training these CACs have makes cases,” Kiehl said in an interview on Monday. 
However, the finance committee put forward the Senate’s proposed budget, with no increases for the centers.
“We took the fiscally constrained position, but ultimately that need has to get met,” Kiehl said.
Kiehl said legislators are having productive discussions, “budget negotiations are vastly better than the state’s fiscal picture.” He said the final budget numbers, which will be a compromise between the two chambers and also take into account Dunleavy’s priorities, will be difficult. 











There's so much need and so little cash.


– Sen. Jesse Kiehl, D-Juneau



	“The backdrop is, we can’t replace every federal dollar. There isn’t enough money, there aren’t enough dollars. There’s just not enough money there. As we in the Senate talk with our conferees,” referring to the Senate’s negotiators in the conference committee. “A number of us have put that on the priority list.” 
“There’s so much need and so little cash,” he added. 
Rep. Zack Fields, D-Anchorage, has advocated for funding the centers throughout the session. He said Monday he believes there is support among lawmakers to approve the funding. “Child advocacy centers are also essential to detect and arrest predators,” he said. “So not funding child advocacy centers is really not an option, because if we didn’t fund them, sex predators would go free and prey on more children. So I think for that reason, no one actually thinks the final budget will fail to fund child advocacy centers.” 
Other budget items related to child-focused programs are more uncertain.
Nutrition program increase faces difficult path
The governor and House proposed a $120,000 increase to child nutritional programs, to provide grant funding over the next three years. The Senate proposed no increase.
Rachel Lord, policy director for the Alaska Food Policy Council and also mayor of Homer, said the state support is necessary.
“1 in 6 Alaskan kids experience hunger, and 20,000 kids in Alaska are supported by SNAP assistance,” she said in an email on Tuesday. “When kids are fed, they learn and behave better. Helping to get food to kids through programs … help not only our most vulnerable Alaskans, but also can support our agricultural industry through local procurement and expanded markets.”
Lord added that Alaskans are relying on lawmakers to manage a stable financial system. “The structural deficit of the state is harmful, especially to our kids, elders, and working families. Reducing hunger in Alaska benefits our workforce, and reduces healthcare and public safety costs over time,” she said. “It is a long-term investment in our state, but it requires fiscal stability that we just don’t have right now.”
Last year, the House proposed an almost $480,000 increase to fund free school lunches, and the Senate also removed the item. 
School lunches are part of the Department of Education and Early Development budget. This year, the only budget increase the Senate’s proposed for child nutrition was $75,000 more for employee salaries. 
A bill to provide free breakfast and lunches for all Alaska students, House Bill 12, sponsored by Rep. Maxine Dibert, D-Fairbanks, also did not advance in the education committee this session. 
Advocates argue infant learning saves future costs
Infant learning programs serve children and families from infancy to age 3, who are experiencing developmental delays. They provide home-based services, interventions and therapies funded by the state and Medicaid health care reimbursements, at no cost to families. Advocates are urging an increased state budget after flat funding since 2014. 
The House proposed a $5.7 million increase in grants to early intervention and infant learning programs. The Senate proposed no increase. 
Laura Norton-Cruz is a social worker, filmmaker and advocate for early childhood programs. “In rural regions, airplane costs have gone up. Health insurance costs have gotten up. And the funding has remained flat,” she told the Beacon earlier this month. “If they continue to flat fund, it is a divestment, right, especially as federal funds disappear,” she said. “(It) is a divestment from children. And if you divest from children, things will get worse.”
Last year, the programs were funded through the Department of Health at $9.7 million. If the conference committee chooses the Senate budget, the statewide infant learning programs would be funded at the same level. 
Child care remains growing need
On child care, the House proposed a $6.1 million increase in child care subsidies, and $7.7 million more in grants to child care providers, totalling $13.8 million in increases. The Senate proposed no increase. 
Fields said it’s an issue of continuing support for the state’s struggling child care sector. 
“We have been funding child care grants for a number of years now,” he said. “It’s a question of, do we maintain continuity with supporting the child care workforce so the parents can work?”
Last year, the House proposed a similar $7.5 million increase, which was removed by the Senate, and the state funded the child care program benefits through the Office of Public Assistance at $47.7 million. 
Whether any of these increases survive in the budget depends on the conference committee, which must weigh them against other priorities.
Sen. Bert Stedman, R-Sitka, and one of the conference committee members said in a news conference on Tuesday that some of the top priorities are funds for wildfire preparedness, emergency services, and child care. On child advocacy centers, he said “we’ll be reviewing that item, that does not go unnoticed.”

(Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Kansas Senate Committee on Government Efficiency spent the first minutes of its Tuesday meeting explaining why it delayed release of messages to news organizations, defying Kansas Open Records Act requirements.
Sen. Renee Erickson, a Wichita Republican and chairwoman of COGE, said news articles had been written about the subject, and she felt it was important for the committee to hear what occurred.
Max Kautsch, a First Amendment rights and open government attorney, said COGE failed to meet requirements laid out in the law, specifically that records should be made available as soon as possible. 
Kansas Reflector made an open records request to access submissions to the COGE portal and email address. The records were not released for more than two months after the request, although Sen. Patrick Schmidt made a KORA request for those records and received them well before that.
KORA requires records be made available within three business days or as soon as possible. 
The two-month timeline could have met KORA requirements if, as the law requires, there had been a “detailed explanation of the cause for further delay,” Kautsch said. 
Gordon Self, a legislative staff member who specializes in statutes, said the portal where people could submit suggestions for COGE indicated those “may be” public records. When KORA requests were received, there were concerns the submissions might contain protected or confidential information, such as Social Security numbers or personal health information, he said. 
To complete a submission on the COGE portal, a checkbox requires that the individual acknowledge the records are public records and subject to the law.
“Once the KORA requests were received and a response was made, there was a review of the records, all 2,000, to determine if any of the records did contain information,” Self said. “After a thorough review, there were some identified that did have some sensitive information in them.”
That information was redacted, he said. 
Kansas Reflector received a copy of the emails from an unnamed source before the KORA request was fulfilled. 
The official copy received later showed few redactions and most appeared to be names, addresses and phone numbers. 
The Reflector’s request yielded disclosures of more than 1,600 submissions that Kansans had made to the portal, Kautsch said. The names and contact information for just 55 submitters were redacted, while the names and contact information for 1,500-plus Kansans were disclosed.
“I thought it was important because there’s been a lot of articles and things out on social media – I thought it was important that this committee hear the process, the rationale for the process,” Erickson said after Self’s presentation. “At the end of the day, there are none that have been deleted, there are none that are not available for review. But as was said, we wanted to make sure that we were not including information that was not appropriate for such a situation.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Gordon-Self-COGE-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-14 09:02:34.967064

Three months after first making the request, California’s largest insurer received approval Tuesday to temporarily raise its rates following the deadly Los Angeles County wildfires in January, writes CalMatters’ Levi Sumagaysay.
Starting June 1, State Farm can hike up its rates by an average of 17% for homeowners, 15% for renters and condos and 38% for rental dwellings. The insurer said it needed emergency interim rate increases “to help avert a dire situation” for its customers and for California’s strained insurance market.
Besides getting the final sign-off from California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara, State Farm also had to get approval from an administrative law judge, Karl-Fredric Seligman.

Seligman, in his decision: “Taken as a whole, it represents a fundamentally fair, adequate, and necessary measure — effectively functioning as a rescue mission to stabilize State Farm’s financial condition while safeguarding policyholders.”

Seligman’s decision also addressed the possibility that this approval could lay the groundwork for other insurers to request emergency interim rate increases following major wildfires. 
The agreement between State Farm and the insurance department does come with a few strings: State Farm has agreed to secure further financial assistance with a $400 million loan from its parent company, and it promised to hold off on policy non-renewals through the end of the year.
Lawmakers and L.A.-area wildfire survivors are also pressuring the insurance department to investigate State Farm for its delayed handling of some claims, which they have argued is reason enough to reject or delay the rate request. But during an online meeting over the weekend with survivors, Lara said the request and the claims complaints were separate issues.
After the rate approval, some survivors criticized the move. 

Joy Chen, leader of the Eaton Fire Survivors Network: “That’s exactly the problem. Approving this rate hike without reviewing State Farm’s conduct would send a chilling message to every Californian: You can pay your premiums — but don’t count on your insurer when disaster strikes.”

Newsom wants tighter regs on pharma intermediaries

On Tuesday Gov. Gavin Newsom said he will seek tighter regulations for pharmacy benefit managers — intermediaries between prescription drug makers and insurance companies — with the aim of reducing drug prices, report CalMatters’ Alexei Koseff and Kristen Hwang.
As part of an updated state budget plan that the governor is expected to go over today, Newsom is calling for California’s Department of Managed Health Care to license pharmacy benefit managers and for those managers to report operational and financial details. Consumer advocates and health economists argue that these intermediaries drive up drug costs by adding fees and retaining discounts as profit.
In September Newsom vetoed a bill that would have regulated these middlemen in a similar way. At the time he wrote that he remained unconvinced that the bill’s licensing requirement would drive down drug prices. Newsom’s office did not explain why the governor has since changed his stance.

Career planning course creates controversy

In California more than 150,000 teenagers this year are getting a head start on their higher education by enrolling in dual enrollment courses — college-level classes high schoolers can complete to receive college credit. But one school in San Jose is one of California’s first middle schools to offer a college-level course, which has some educators concerned.
As CalMatters’ Adam Echelman explains, 13- and 14-year-old students at August Boeger Middle School can attend a college “Career Planning” course offered by the San Jose Evergreen Community College District, where they can learn about career paths, resume writing and more. 
Though there is little data on middle schoolers specifically, other research has shown that high schoolers who take college classes are more likely to attend and graduate college. But as the college district looks to offer other courses, such as sociology and ethnic studies, some are worried about the quality of classes and their complex subject matter.

,California,2025-05-14 13:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,Newsom proposes to freeze Medi-Cal enrollment for undocumented immigrants,Kristen Hwang,,,,,https://calmatters.org/health/2025/05/newsom-freeze-medi-cal-undocumented-immigrants/,"To save more than $5 billion, the California governor wants to shut down new enrollment for adults who lack legal status and charge premiums. The Legislature has resisted such changes.","In summary
To save more than $5 billion, the California governor wants to shut down new enrollment for adults who lack legal status and charge premiums. The Legislature has resisted such changes.



A year after granting Medi-Cal access to low-income immigrants without legal status, Gov. Gavin Newsom is proposing to freeze enrollment of new recipients and charge premiums in a move expected to save the state more than $5 billion.
Under Newsom’s proposal announced today, Medi-Cal — the state’s health insurance program for low-income people and those with disabilities — beginning in 2026 would no longer accept new enrollees 19 and older who lack permanent legal status.
The 1.6 million immigrants already signed up would not lose their Medi-Cal coverage, and children could still enroll. All undocumented Californians would still be covered for emergency medical and pregnancy care — so-called “limited scope” coverage that is paid for with federal dollars. But those who don’t enroll before January 2026 would be uncovered for other medical expenses, such as prescription drugs and doctor’s visits. 
Before the changes could go into effect, the California Legislature would have to approve them in the state budget. Democratic lawmakers have so far largely balked at making major cuts to Medi-Cal coverage for immigrants.
State Sen. Scott Wiener, a San Francisco Democrat and chair of the Senate budget committee, said at a luncheon last month that despite fiscal uncertainty, Senate Democrats want to ensure healthcare coverage for immigrants in California. 
“These are folks who are working, paying taxes. They should have access to health care,” Wiener said. 
Newsom also proposed that adults with “unsatisfactory immigration status” should pay a $100 monthly premium starting in 2027. Those are people whose immigration status makes them ineligible for federal Medicaid, including those with lawful status. The $100 premium is less than the average subsidized premium paid under Covered California, according to the governor’s office.
Together these moves would save the state $5.4 billion by 2028-29, Newsom’s office said, helping to address the state’s projected $16 billion deficit.
Newsom’s office said the deficit required “tough decisions” but that the governor remained committed to protecting immigrants.
“These changes are designed to preserve that commitment, protect coverage for millions of Californians, and preserve the strength of our values and health care system,” according to the governor’s fact sheet.
The decision is a bruising blow to Newsom, who ran for governor on the promise of universal health care. California was the second state after Oregon to offer full-scope health insurance to all immigrants without legal status. 
“These are folks who are working, paying taxes. They should have access to health care.”State Sen. Scott Wiener
Newsom’s office blamed wide-ranging tariffs imposed by the Trump administration for weakening the state’s expected revenues, but the Medi-Cal program was already experiencing cost problems related to growing enrollment and increasing costs of prescription drugs.
In March, the administration reported a $6.2 billion shortfall in its Medi-Cal budget, and had to appropriate additional funds to pay providers through the end of June.
The Department of Health Care Services, which oversees Medi-Cal, cited a number of reasons for exceeding its budget, including that it was spending about $2.7 billion more than anticipated on people without legal status. 
The state spends about $8.5 billion a year from the general fund to cover immigrants who are in the country without legal authorization, according to the Newsom administration’s estimates.
The request for additional dollars was criticized by Republicans in the Legislature, who say the governor and Democrats over-promised on what the state could afford. 
Newsom’s call to limit enrollment comes as Congress is proposing major spending reductions to the federal Medicaid program. (Medi-Cal is California’s name for Medicaid.)
One proposal aims to penalize states that cover unauthorized immigrants. That penalty would come in the form of reduced federal funding for the Affordable Care Act expansion population — largely able-bodied adults without children. If enacted, that penalty could cost California about $3.2 billion a year in federal funding, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

Photo by Nafi Soumare/Minnesota Reformer.Even as Republicans in Congress walk back their most aggressive proposal to slash federal Medicaid spending, they are weighing other options that could force states to cut services for children and other vulnerable populations.
U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters last week that his caucus won’t reduce the 90% federal funding match that states get to cover working-age adults who became eligible for Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. However, the GOP is still considering capping federal spending by setting a fixed amount for how much states receive for every Medicaid enrollee.
That move would fundamentally change the nature of the program, which has been an open-ended entitlement since its passage 60 years ago.

Another Republican congressional proposal would limit states’ ability to increase Medicaid payments to doctors and hospitals by using tax revenue they collect from health care providers. States draw down additional federal dollars by utilizing the strategy, and the extra money helps many hospitals stay afloat.
Any federal cuts to Medicaid — large or small — would strain state budgets and likely lead to service cuts and coverage for fewer people, according to a new analysis released last week by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
The agency predicted that to make up for lost federal dollars, states would have to reduce payments to health care providers, curb benefits or reduce enrollment. Some advocates also suggest that states might seek savings in other areas of their budgets, such as K-12 education.
Child health advocates say any of those actions would have a significant trickle-down effect on children and their caregivers. They’re concerned states would have to reduce or even eliminate services that help tens of millions of children access routine care that’s critical from birth, such as vaccinations and physical exams.
Half of U.S. kids
About half of the nation’s 72.8 million children are covered by Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP, another joint federal-state program that covers children from families who earn too much to qualify for traditional Medicaid.
“I think what is missing from some of these debates is [Medicaid] is not only the primary payer for children’s health, it’s also supporting the safety net for children’s health, by paying for hospitals, clinics, physicians and offices,” said Heather Howard, a former New Jersey health commissioner who is now a faculty affiliate with the Center for Health and Wellbeing at Princeton University.
“It’ll mean that hospitals will close in rural areas, but even in urban areas, we’re going to see, as hospitals see their funding cut, they’re going to have to pull back on services,” Howard added. “And that clearly is going to impact kids.”

Mississippi pediatrician Dr. John Gaudet said the importance of Medicaid for children begins at birth; Medicaid covered 41% of all U.S. births in 2021. The program also covers a benefit package called Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment, which covers an array of critical services meant to take care of childhood mental and physical health, such as dental and vision care, vaccinations, lab tests and physical exams.
The program serves children struggling with severe emotional distress, as well as physical disabilities. Medicaid pays for long-term and home-based care services.
Gaudet says he’s afraid that a variety of child-related services could be affected by federal Medicaid cuts.
“As a pediatrician, I’m very concerned about prevention and wellness, because that’s going to give you more return on your investment in the long run, if you can prevent an illness rather than wait until it gets more severe and then you’re having to treat it,” Gaudet said in an interview.
School health services
Medicaid cuts also could affect the health services offered in schools.
Between $4 billion and $6 billion in annual Medicaid spending helps pay for school-based health services, including routine health screenings, preventive care, mental health care and physical, speech and occupational therapies.
Children from underserved communities disproportionately rely on school-based health services, according to Abuko Estrada, vice president of Medicaid and child health policy at First Focus on Children, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit group.
“We’re not only talking about things like higher emergency room utilization for kids or increased hospitalizations for preventable conditions,” Estrada said in an interview. “We’re also talking about lost educational opportunities, potentially reduced future earnings in adulthood, and perpetuating cycles of poor health that ultimately cost the nation far more than it would potentially save.”


As hospitals see their funding cut, they’re going to have to pull back on services. And that clearly is going to impact kids.


– Heather Howard, former New Jersey commissioner of health and senior services


But Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that is working with Republicans to imagine Medicaid cuts, wrote in an email to Stateline that the ideas circulating on Capitol Hill wouldn’t harm children at all. Rather, he said, the proposed cuts would shift the funding focus away from working-age adults toward children and more vulnerable populations.
“In my view, it is a moral imperative for Congress to protect the program for the truly vulnerable and end Washington’s discrimination in favor of non-disabled, working-age, childless adults,” wrote Blase, who was a health care adviser to President Donald Trump during his first term.
Chris Pope, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning policy group the Manhattan Institute, said he doesn’t think Republicans in Congress will be able to cut much from Medicaid.
Republicans couldn’t get the votes to make major changes when they tried in 2017, Pope noted, and they have even fewer votes this year. “Unless they can get every Republican to sign off on cuts,” he said, “it’s just not going to happen.”

Republicans in Congress are trying to find roughly $2 trillion in savings to offset the cost of extending tax cuts enacted during the first Trump administration and to make additional tax cuts. The U.S. House committee that oversees Medicaid is supposed to come up with $880 billion of that total.
Despite Johnson’s assertion that reducing the federal Medicaid match for working-age adults is off the table, some fiscal hawks in his own party aren’t ready to give up the idea, which would save more money than any other proposal.
“It’s necessary to stop robbing from the vulnerable to fund the able-bodied,” U.S. Rep. Chip Roy of Texas wrote on X shortly after Johnson’s comments were reported.
In a May 7 letter to House Republican leaders, 32 GOP representatives vowed to find $2 trillion in cuts, calling the House budget framework “a floor for savings, not a ceiling. We must hold that line on fiscal discipline to put the country back on a sustainable path,” the letter said.

More than a thousand species have been identified as priorities for conservation in a sweeping update to Delaware’s Wildlife Action Plan, state officials announced this week.
The Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC) is leading the revision of the Delaware Wildlife Action Plan (DEWAP), a comprehensive 10-year strategy designed to guide conservation efforts through 2035.
Central to the plan is the Species of Greatest Conservation Need (SGCN) list, which highlights native species facing threats from habitat loss, declining populations, and other environmental pressures.
READ: Here are the 2025 Delaware school board election results
At-risk animal AND plant species
In a key development, DNREC and its partners have proposed the inclusion of over 300 plant species to the SGCN list, raising the total number of species in need of protection to more than 1,000.
The list is categorized into three tiers based on the urgency of conservation needs, with Tier 1 representing the highest level of concern.
Each U.S. state develops its own SGCN list using criteria such as global and local rarity, federal or state endangered status, and regional conservation priority. In Delaware’s case, the list also considers species designated as priorities in the Northeast region.
DNREC is now seeking public input on the draft list and the broader plan.
Residents can review the draft and submit comments online here or via email to DEWAP2025@delaware.gov.
Additional draft sections of the plan will be released over the summer, with public meetings planned for July and August.
The final version of the updated Wildlife Action Plan is expected to be released this fall.
The update is the result of collaboration among numerous partners, including federal, state, and local agencies, academic institutions, non-profits, and members of the public.

This San Jose school is finding out,Adam Echelman,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/k-12-education/2025/05/middle-school-california/,"The San Jose Evergreen Community College District offers a course at a local middle school, and plans to offer more in the future. The college faculty union worries that the students are too young.","In summary
The San Jose Evergreen Community College District offers a course at a local middle school, and plans to offer more in the future. The college faculty union worries that the students are too young.


By 2:45 p.m. the regular school day at August Boeger Middle School had already ended, but one class is about to start. More than 20 eighth graders drop their backpacks and settle into desks — not for extra credit but for college credit.
These 13- and 14-year-old students in East San Jose are taking their first college course, an entry-level class on career planning. This middle school is one of the first in the state to offer a college-level course. In the coming years, the San Jose Evergreen Community College District wants all middle school students in this school district to be able to complete three college courses before they start high school, and soon, the district plans to offer other courses, such as sociology and ethnic studies, said Biatriz Chaidez, the chancellor for the community college district.
Middle schoolers have long been eligible to enroll in college classes in California, though only a few, high-achieving students actually do it. By offering a college class at a middle school — especially one in a high-poverty area — the community college district is looking to make that enrollment easier. The class is taught by a middle school staff member, and it’s reserved exclusively for middle school students. 
But with so few programs, there is little research about whether students are benefitting, and the local faculty union is worried middle school students might not be ready. 
Chaidez disagrees. “Navigating (college) as early as middle school is unheard of in their community,” she said. “So when they experience success, it really motivates them to continue.”
California is increasingly pushing high schools to offer community college classes directly to students during the regular school day, a set-up known as “dual enrollment.” Unlike AP classes, which include expensive exams and are limited to certain subjects and high-performing students, these community college classes cover a range of topics and are open to all students. By 2030, California Community Colleges Chancellor Sonya Chiristian wants all high school students to graduate with at least four college courses completed. 
Chaidez wants to go further. She wants every local high school student to be able to complete about 20 college courses by the time they graduate — enough to earn an associate’s degree. 
CalMatters reached out to the college district’s faculty union, which was surprised to learn the district is offering classes at a middle school. 
“This opens up some problems,” said Jessica Breheny, an English professor and the union’s vice president. “I’m sure there are 12-year-olds that are college-ready, but there are just less of them and it’s less likely. Developmentally, they have other things going on.”
Research shows that high schoolers who take college classes are more likely to attend college and graduate, but there’s little research on how middle school students fare, said John Fink, a senior researcher at Columbia University’s Community College Research Center. “Nationally, and in most states, this is very, very rare, and in many states this is not allowed.” Instead, he said the focus is typically on enrolling more 10th, 11th and 12th graders in college courses.
A college-level course, with a few middle school games
About 10% of California’s high school students took a community college class in the 2021-22 school year, according to an analysis by professors at UC Davis using the most recent data. California’s community college system doesn’t track how many middle school students take college courses. 
So far, the Mount Pleasant Elementary School District, which includes August Boeger Middle School, offers only one college course, called “Career Planning,” and it’s almost indistinguishable from any other class on its campus. The college course is taught in a regular middle school classroom, and the professor, Oscar Lamas, already works at the middle school, where he’s a counselor. Perhaps the only noticeable difference is the timing: The middle school day ends at 2:30 p.m. and Lamas’ course starts at 2:45. He’s paid separately by the community college to teach the course.

Career Planning helps students learn about career paths, practice resume-writing and learn psychological theories related to professional success. A governing board of college district professors, known as the Academic Senate, sets the objectives for each college course, but Lamas has broad discretion in teaching it. The Academic Senate responsible for setting the parameters of Lamas’ course did not respond to multiple requests for comment. 
The dean of the community college’s counseling department, Victor Garza, refused an interview request from CalMatters but issued a written statement. Garza said the middle school class is akin to other dual enrollment courses, which maintain the college’s “academic rigor.” 
“Some adjustments might be needed to cater to the unique needs and experiences” of students, he added.
On a Thursday before spring break, Lamas tries to make his class more fun by breaking the students into five teams to play a Jeopardy-style quiz game on the topic of the day, Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs. 
Natalie Mendoza, 14, becomes the default spokesperson of her team, named the “Tacos R Us Club,” but she answers the first question wrong, putting her team back 300 points and prompting her classmates to burst into chatter and analyze their mistakes. 
As part of the class, she has to study a career, write a short essay about it and present it at a career fair. She picked intellectual property law. “A lot of people say I’m assertive,” she said. “I think that’s a really good trait for a lawyer, and I think it’d be fun to fight for people who have created stuff.”

Natalie said she’d be the first in her family to attend college but she’s already planning to go and has a few schools in mind, including UC Berkeley and San Jose State. If she does attend one of those schools, her grade in this counseling class would be part of her official college transcript.
Breheny, with the union, said she’s concerned about the quality of the classes, especially once the college district begins teaching other subjects, such as ethnic studies. 
“Faculty designed their courses for adult learners,” Breheny said. An ethnic studies class may cover topics such as sexual violence and genocide, she added — topics that may be difficult to convey to a middle schooler. “Some of the material assumes a certain knowledge about the world, about politics, which you may not have at 11, 12, 13 years old.”
High schools offer few dual enrollment classes
August Boeger Middle School sits at the base of the Diablo Range mountains, tucked between the ranch-style homes and strip malls that color East San Jose. Teachers and staff greet each other with mucho gusto instead of hello. All around the open-air campus, murals tell the story of the region’s multi-cultural heritage, especially its Mexican and Chicano roots. 
That celebration of culture is a direct response to a history of adversity, Lamas said. “East San Jose has always been a marginalized, disadvantaged environment.” As a result, schools in the community contend with education disparities, he said, such as a high dropout rate and a high teen pregnancy rate.

Offering a college class to these middle school students allows them to “see a possibility for their future that doesn’t exist within these walls here” and can inspire them to reach for a higher goal, said Marisa Peña, a school advisor.
Male students, Black and Latino students and students from rural areas are underrepresented in the community college courses offered at California’s school districts. California lawmakers have signed numerous bills in the hopes of expanding access but certain regions in the state, such as Los Angeles, enroll a higher percentage of students.
Natalie said she hopes to continue taking college courses when she starts at Mount Pleasant High School this fall, which is just around the corner from her middle school. But her options are limited.
 “Nationally, and in most states, this is very, very rare, and in many states this is not allowed.”John Fink, senior researcher at Columbia University’s Community College Research Center
Mount Pleasant High School offers just three community college courses, which serve about 10% of the school’s roughly 1,000 students, said Kyle Kleckner, the school district’s director of instructional services. All of the classes are in “multimedia” studies, he said, which teaches students how to create their own podcasts or YouTube channels, along with other digital marketing skills. 
Although Mount Pleasant High School’s dual enrollment is about on par with the state average, it trails other districts in the region. Less than 20 miles away, at high schools in the Milpitas Unified School District, roughly 25% of students enrolled in a community college class in 2021-22, according to the UC Davis analysis.
Finding professors to teach middle school
Part of the dual enrollment challenge is finding qualified college professors who are willing and able to work at a high school or middle school. Existing middle and high school teachers are allowed to teach college courses but they have to meet the qualifications, which usually include a master’s degree in the area of instruction. Most of California’s high school and middle school instructors lack a master’s degree, according to a study by the Public Policy Institute of California.

“We have graduation requirements that students have to accomplish,” Kleckner said. “The trick is finding that community college course that also fulfills those requirements and also finding a teacher who can teach it.” He said Mount Pleasant High School is committed to expanding the number of college courses but noted that it’s smaller and therefore has fewer teachers who meet the requirements to teach a college course. 
In turn, many college professors lack experience teaching children, said Breheny, who teaches at San Jose City College. “We have had some problems already with dual enrollment where faculty have gone to different (high schools) to teach and have dealt with classroom management issues that they wouldn’t have in a college course.” In one case, she said a college faculty member saw bullying in a high school classroom but didn’t feel equipped to respond. 
Lamas has a master’s degree, which is required for most school counselors. He’s gentle with the middle school students in his class, occasionally awarding points in the Jeopardy game even when the answer isn’t perfect. Lamas had two quiz games planned that day, each one covering a different topic, but the first game took up almost all of the class time. 
He ends class by taking questions about the upcoming final project. Although spring break is minutes away, the students sit still through the final minutes, except for the occasional joke and bursts of laughter. Not a single phone was in sight.
Once class ends, however, chatter ensues, the students pull out their phones, and staff escort them to the parking lot. While they may be taking a college course, they still must wait for their parents to pick them up.

A federal judge on Tuesday ordered the “full restoration” of services at the National Institute for Occupational Health and Safety’s Respiratory Health Division, ending a reduction in force that robbed coal miners nationwide who rely on the program of options to prevent further illness and injury.
U.S. District Judge Irene Berger issued Tuesday’s preliminary injunction as part of ongoing litigation in a class action lawsuit filed by coal miners against the federal government over the closure of the Coal Workers’ Health Surveillance Program, a department within NIOSH’s Respiratory Health Division.
Workers at the CWHSP, as well as numerous other NIOSH departments and divisions, have been on administrative leave since April due to “reorganizations” happening at the federal level. Permanent terminations for most employees were scheduled to occur in June and July as part of cost-saving measures instituted by the new federal Department of Government Efficiency.
Berger’s order on Tuesday directed the federal Department of Health and Human Services to do three things: rescind all RIFs issued to workers in the Respiratory Health Division at NIOSH, continue all work mandated by the federal Mine Safety and Health Act without “pause, stoppage or gap” if and when the federal government continues efforts to “reorganize” itself and have DHHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. submit a written certification to the court in 20 days showing that the federal government is complying with its orders.
Job cuts reversed at Pittsburgh lab that certifies nation’s respirators

At a hearing for the case in Charleston last week, coal miners testified that, without staffing at the CWHSP, they are unable to exercise rights afforded to them through the federal Mine Act.
Utilizing those rights — which have existed for decades and are mandated through an act of Congress — requires action by NIOSH’s CWHSP.
But since April 1, the department has been unstaffed. Some workers were told to return to work in early May. But last week they were once again put back on leave. On Tuesday, hours before Berger’s order was filed, members of West Virginia’s congressional delegation announced that at least 100 NIOSH workers were returning to work permanently.
Without any workers, coal miners across the country have been unable to have black lung screening results certified by NIOSH. That certification is necessary for miners with black lung to qualify for a Part 90 transfer, which allows them to move to a different, less dusty part of a mine without retribution — including a cut in pay, hours or benefits — from their employers.
 Arguments in the case and Berger’s ruling

Attorneys for the miners have argued that the rights afforded to coal miners to access free black lung screenings and secure transfers once diagnosed, among other services, cannot be stopped just because the federal government is going through a reorganization. Berger agreed, saying Kennedy and DHHS “lack the authority to unilaterally cancel the CWHSP” since it exists to serve a responsibility mandated by congress.
“[DHHS and Kennedy] do not indicate how many extra months of dust inhalation, in their considered judgment, is acceptable for a miner with black lung while the program Congress established to eliminate that risk is ‘paused,’” Berger wrote.
Attorneys for the federal government argued that the lawsuit should be thrown out because it deals with employees angry over being terminated, which does not justify a federal class action suit. Berger called those claims “patently absurd,” saying the plaintiffs in the case are not employees, but are beneficiaries of programs that were stopped through “illegal agency action” at DHHS.

The federal government also alleged that services ending at NIOSH and specifically the CWHSP were temporary and couldn’t be construed as being a final agency action. They maintained that, since those services were likely to return, there was no immediate harm present that necessitated a preliminary injunction.
In her order, however, Berger, who was nominated by President Barack Obama, again disagreed and noted that the federal government repeatedly failed to show evidence outlining how CWHSP’s services would be resumed, when that would happen or in what manner. She wrote that testimony from NIOSH employees and the case’s lead plaintiff, Harry Wiley, presented “overwhelming evidence” that the work had been stopped — not just paused.
“The [federal government’s] evidence consisted solely of press releases regarding a planned reorganization of HHS that contained no mention of the programs at issue. Thus, the only evidence before the Court is that the CWHSP and the RHD have been shut down,” Berger wrote.
That shut down, she said, presented clear harm as miners with black lung like Wiley were being continually exposed to dangerous coal dust despite congressional actions existing that are meant to shield them from such.
“As the testimony before the Court made clear, that dust exposure will cause [Wiley’s] disease to progress until it becomes debilitating. Does [Kennedy] genuinely believe that a miner diagnosed with black lung is not being injured when the program designed to confirm his condition and provide him with workplace protections to prevent its progression is rendered inaccessible?” Berger wrote. “This Court does not share such a belief.”
There is no cure and limited treatment options for black lung. The only adequate intervention for people who have the disease, experts say, is limiting exposure to dangerous coal dust that is known to exacerbate it.
Wiley lives in Kanawha County but works in a Raleigh County mine as a mine electrician.
A miner for 38 years, Wiley was diagnosed with black lung disease in November 2024 by a local clinic. He sent the results to NIOSH to start proceedings to be approved for a Part 90 transfer. In December, according to evidence submitted to the court, NIOSH sent a letter to Wiley saying a CT scan from October 2023 did not show findings of black lung.
Wiley testified that he never received this letter. He called NIOSH multiple times to follow up on his transfer request and got no response. If he had known they were looking at an outdated scan, he told the court, he would have submitted additional evidence to verify his black lung diagnosis and secure his Part 90 letter. And if the CWHSP were still functional, he said, he would have accessed a free screening through the agency.
Instead, Wiley — and every other miner in the country who has been unable to contact or work with NIOSH over recent months for a Part 90 transfer — has been forced to continue working in dustier parts of the mine.
Berger said it’s clear, given how black lung develops and the lack of treatments for it, that keeping the CWHSP functional is overwhelmingly and “strongly” in the public’s interest.
“[NIOSH epidemiologists] testified that they are seeing more miners with black lung, and more cases that progress quickly. They also testified that their work, and the work of the CWHSP as a whole, saves lives,” Berger said. “The necessary inverse of that testimony is that cancelling the CWHSP will cost lives. Remaining in a dusty job may reduce the years in which Mr. Wiley can walk and breathe unassisted, in addition to hastening his death. It is difficult to imagine a clearer case of irreparable harm.”

The National Park Service in 2022 alleged some of the branding of the newly formed Flathead Valley professional baseball team closely resembled imagery used by the federal agency.
The Range Riders, an MLB Partner League baseball team, announced their team name and logos in January 2022, drawing inspiration from the early days of the National Park Service and the forerunners of park rangers. 
Ridge Run Intangibles, Inc., which owns the team, filed trademark applications for two logos that include the team’s animal mascots, two logotypes, and a downward-facing white arrowhead with a black double “R” emblazoned on it. 
Attorneys for the Department of the Interior filed a letter of protest in October 2022, saying the arrowhead logo was similar to the emblem of the National Park Service — also a downward facing arrow, showing a tree, mountain and bison and the agency name in white lettering— and created a “possible likelihood of confusion” and “possible false association” between the two logos. 
The Range Riders denied there was any attempt to associate and benefit from the NPS’ reputation, and that the only similarity between the logos was the generic arrowhead shape — one used by other sports teams including the Kansas City Chiefs football team. 
According to documents filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the federal government filed a withdrawal of their opposition on April 1, “in accordance with the parties’ settlement agreement.”
Scot Gladstone, communications director for the Range Riders, declined to comment on the specifics of the settlement.
“The case was resolved with prejudice in our favor, meaning that our use of the arrowhead shape noes not imply any affiliation with the National Park Service,” Gladstone told the Daily Montanan in a text.
In a press release, team officials called it a “successful resolution,” and claimed the “prolonged administrative battle that ensued imposed substantial financial and operational burdens that are insurmountable for most small, community-driven businesses like the Range Riders.”
“This was an important fight, not only for securing our right to the arrowhead logo, but also ensuring this universal symbol remains open for others to use,” Chris Kelly, President of the Glacier Range Riders, said in the press release. “With the withdrawal of the NPS claim, we’re free to focus on what matters most – bringing families together, creating lasting memories, and celebrating the region’s rich heritage through the game of baseball.” 
Range Riders officials thanked the Flathead Valley community, fans and supporters, as well as U.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke, R-Montana, who brought the issue to national attention when he questioned then-Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland about the dispute during a Congressional hearing. 
Haaland stated she had no knowledge of the dispute, which Zinke called “frivolous and predatory.”
In a statement provided to the Daily Montanan, Zinke said it was a “great day to be a Range Rider.”
“This was a bogus lawsuit against a family-owned local baseball team that, honestly, the feds had no grounds to pursue in the first place. I was happy to help them fight back against this textbook example of federal overreach and only regret that a Montana small business had to spend so much time, money and resources defending themselves against the full weight of the Biden Administration. I look forward to another great season and will be rocking my arrowhead hat proudly,” Zinke said.

(Photos by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)An incumbent who has been endorsed by President Donald Trump? Or a challenger who paints himself as the “Make Utah Great Again” candidate? 
Some 4,000 Utah Republican Party delegates will elect their next leader during their state organizing convention on Saturday at Utah Valley University in Orem. 
Their decision will have major implications for the future direction of the Utah GOP, and it’s sure to stir heated debate between two factions within the party — those who like the direction the party has already been heading under incumbent Chair Rob Axson versus anti-establishment conservatives who are fans of former state lawmaker and failed gubernatorial candidate Phil Lyman. 

Lyman is likely to get a warm reception from delegates, who handed him the party’s nomination in his bid for governor with 67.5% of the vote during last year’s nominating convention. But because Gov. Spencer Cox used the state’s other option to get his name on the ballot as a Republican by gathering signatures, Cox and Lyman both qualified for the GOP primary, which Lyman lost. He still didn’t give up, continuing his bid in the general election as an unaffiliated write-in candidate, which he also lost — however, he captured more than 13.5% of the vote, which was the most ever seen for a write-in bid.
But Axson, who has served as Utah GOP chair since 2023, got a major boost when Trump endorsed him in a post on Truth Social on Thursday, with just over a week to go before the convention. 
Axson has also been endorsed by other Utah Republican Party heavyweights including Sen. Mike Lee, who called him in a post on X “one of the most effective state party chairmen we’ve ever had in Utah, he’s one of the best in the entire country.” 
“He’s uniformly respected and admired as a member of the RNC,” Lee added. “He’s an unusually dedicated, talented, and energetic person. I’ve known and worked closely with him throughout the last 16 years, and he’s one of the most decent people I’ve ever known.”
Lyman — who is championing a “MUGA” slogan, often mirrors Trump’s style and was even pardoned by Trump back in 2020 for leading an illegal ATV protest on federal lands — shrugged off Trump’s endorsement of his opponent.

“Reminder – MAGA is about America – and I love it,” Lyman wrote in a post on X. “My support for Donald Trump is not contingent on his support for me. We have work to do. Oh, and Cox cheated.”
Lyman also continues to refuse to accept that Cox legally won the election, even though Lyman and his team have lost every single court challenge. Throughout both his campaigns for governor and Utah GOP chair, Lyman has also catered largely to a faction of Utah Republicans who continue to despise SB54, the 2014 law that set a dual path to the primary ballot through both the caucus and convention system and through signature gathering. 
After more than 10 years, SB54 has survived years of court challenges — to the point of almost bankrupting the Utah GOP. But angst over SB54 persists, and it’s one of the biggest wedges dividing Utah Republicans. 
That angst is sure to boil up again Saturday in more ways than one. 
Proposal to yank party membership from signature gatherers
According to the convention’s agenda, delegates are also slated to consider a proposed amendment to the party’s constitution that would temporarily revoke a Republican candidate’s party membership if they gain access to the ballot through signature gathering rather than through the caucus convention system. 
“Any person who seeks public office ballot access as a Republican by any mechanism other than that specifically provided within this Constitution shall be deemed to have failed to comply with the Republican Party Constitution and that person’s membership shall immediately be revoked for one year,” the proposed amendment reads. 



Let us know what you think...


 


In its bylaws, the Utah Republican Party accepts the caucus and convention process as the nominating process. Because of SB54, however, state law specifies that candidates can get their name on the ballot through the convention nomination, the signature gathering path, or both. 
State law also specifies two types of political parties: registered parties and qualified political parties. Candidates of registered parties must use signature gathering to access the ballot, while candidates of qualified parties (a designation the Utah GOP currently functions under), can either gather signatures or be nominated at convention. Utah law does not have a designation that lets parties only allow ballot access through nomination. 
If the GOP’s proposed amendment to strip a candidate’s party membership for using a legal pathway to the ballot passes, it’s possible it could lead to yet another court challenge. 
It’s also possible that party leaders could try to push the Utah Legislature to change the law. 
Axson vs. Lyman
Axson, in a statement on his campaign website, pledged he will “keep pushing back against signature gathering on all fronts.” He added that the “timing is right” because “for the first time since SB54 was signed into law, there will be no statewide offices up for election this cycle.” 
“Unlike previous attempts to reverse SB54, we must be strategic and work with the Legislature to protect the most meaningful nominating process in the country – our neighborhood delegates!” Axson said. 


Dear Delegates,
At this point, you likely know me so I will skip the introduction and jump straight to my message.

Lyman, in multiple posts on his X profile, has promised to prioritize “pursuing the possibility of the party running its own primary elections independent of the state.” He has also said the party has been “infiltrated with those who do not respect the GOP, who do not accept our platform, and who are actively trying to undermine our caucus system.”
He’s also called for a “revival” within the party.
“A revival of our caucus-convention system where delegate voices matter. A revival of transparent, honest elections so we can feel comfortable that are (sic) elected officials earned their responsibilities. A revival of a party that stands its ground and doesn’t bow to the wishes of the elites and lobbyists,” Lyman said in a post on X. 
Axson, on the other hand, has campaigned with the slogan “redder is better,” with an emphasis on “connecting and building relationships.” He has also pointed to his past experience leading the party, noting that after he was elected chair in 2023, he and his team raised nearly $3 million, a record amount for a year that saw some of the most conservative wins in an election cycle. 
“As Chair, Rob is committed to sustaining a serious statewide political organization to further the goals of conservatives in Utah,” Axson’s website says. “Gone are the days of debt and fear of bankruptcy!” 
Given both Axson and Lyman appear to be well liked among delegates, Saturday’s convention will be revealing — not just of infighting, but of what kind of leadership style resonates most with delegates and what kind of strategy to expect for future challenges of SB54.

(Alander Rocha/Alabama Reflector)A bill aimed at regulating consumable hemp products has landed on Gov. Kay Ivey’s desk, but its future is uncertain.
HB 445, sponsored by Rep. Andy Whitt, R-Harvest, would establish regulations for consumable hemp products in Alabama, but the bill’s language and potential consequences have led the hemp industry to suggest the possibility of litigation and led to uncertainty among lawmakers, business owners, patients and lobbyists.
“It is my hope that the governor signs the bill this week. I think it’s a good piece of legislation. I think it’s a bipartisan piece of legislation, and certainly, we have to get the guardrails up on this industry,” Whitt said in a phone interview Tuesday.

Key provisions of the bill include:  

Testing and labeling requirements for all consumable hemp products.
Caps of 10 milligrams per individually wrapped product, with a cap of 40 milligrams per package.
Authorization for the Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) Board to license retailers of these products.  
Restrictions on retail establishments selling hemp products.  
Prohibition of sales to minors.  
Prohibition of smokable hemp products and restrictions on online sales and direct delivery.  
Imposition of an excise tax on consumable hemp products.  

The bill defines “consumable hemp product” broadly as any finished product intended for human or animal consumption that contains any part of the hemp plant or its derivatives, but explicitly bans smokable hemp products and certain psychoactive cannabinoids. 
It’s unclear whether the bill would ban CBD, a non-psychoactive cannabinoid found in hemp. According to the bill, “any smokeable hemp product” not limited to “plant product or raw hemp material that is marketed to consumers as hemp cigarettes, hemp cigars, hemp joints, hemp buds, hemp flowers, hemp leaves, ground hemp flowers, or any variation of these terms to include any product that contains a cannabinoid, whether psychoactive or not.”
Disagreements among lawmakers
The bill was replaced with a substitute on the floor that had not been discussed in the Senate committee hearing, and a copy was not made available to the public until after its passage. Molly Cole, a lobbyist for the Alabama Hemp and Vape Association, said she wished a senator had asked for the bill to be read on the floor.
“When Sen. Melson came onto the floor and proposed this bill for the substitute, … no one called for it to be read on the floor. And then the way he proposed it was that all this bill does is move products to 21 and up stores,” Cole said, which she felt was misleading.
Even the bill’s sponsor and the senator who handled the bill in the upper chamber appear to be at odds over its implementation.
Sen. Tim Melson, R-Florence, whose bill aimed at hemp regulation failed in committee but who handled Whitt’s legislation in the Senate, said in an interview Tuesday that he was uncertain about whether the bill bans hemp-derived THC vapes. He thought that hemp-derived vapes could still be purchased in a 21+ vape shop.
“The hemp vape products, yes, anything with the THC would go to, my understanding … they would go to vape stores. But that being said, I’d have to double check now that you got me questioning,” Melson said.
Whitt, however, was clear on the matter.
“Any smokeable, any inhalable product, is banned under this legislation. Vapes would be banned as well that had delta-8 and (delta)-9 in those,” he said.
Delta-8 THC and delta-9 THC are psychoactive compounds found in cannabis, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

‘Our future in Alabama is uncertain’
Representatives of the hemp industry strongly oppose the measure, warning of consequences for both businesses and consumers.
Carmelo Parasiliti, founder and CEO of Green Acres Organic Pharms in Florence, pointed to the potential damage the bill could have on his business. Parasiliti said that nearly every product they currently offer is federally legal and lab tested. Under HB 445, he said, it would all be illegal. 
“We’re going to keep our storefront open and serve Alabama to the best of our ability, but our future in Alabama is uncertain, and I’m really hoping Gov. Kay Ivey will veto this bill if she truly supports small businesses,” Parasiliti said in an interview Tuesday.
He also pointed to potential harm to people who benefit from hemp medically, particularly those in a cancer program he started to provide free or low-cost hemp-derived products to people referred by providers.
“Even more troubling is the bill makes it unlawful to give these products away to people in need, no matter their condition, which I think is cruelty,” Parasiliti said.
Nancy Owen Nelson, a cancer patient living in Florence who uses hemp, mostly CBD, for symptom management and a participant in the Green Acres Organic Pharm cancer program, said she was disappointed with the bill. Nelson said he plans to write a letter to Ivey encouraging her to veto it. She said she tried to leave a voicemail, but found it was full. 
“The thing about this condition is that it is not anywhere in particular, so it is a whole body sensation, and a whole body fatigue. It helps me sleep, it helps me rest, and it helps me feel calmer,” Owen Nelson said.
Whitt and Melson say that the bill’s primary objective is to protect children and regulate an industry that has operated largely unchecked. Owen Nelson said she agrees with regulating the hemp industry but feels the bill goes too far, and that she wasn’t sure if the bill would accomplish its intent of limiting access for minors, saying that children will find a way to these products.
“It’s the responsibility of the vendors to not sell children and the families to protect their children within their homes,” she said.
Whitt felt strongly that the need for “guardrails” on the hemp industry, saying it was his goal to rein in “the wild west of what’s been derived out of the 2018 Farm Bill.”
The 2018 Farm Bill removed hemp and any cannabis product with no more than 0.3% THC by dry weight from the definition of marijuana under federal law.
Confusion in the industry
Molly Cole, a lobbyist for the Alabama Hemp and Vape Association, said the industry is confused about how the bill defines consumable hemp product. She also pointed to conflicting implementation dates, which say that the “act shall become effective on July 1, 2025,” but indicate that businesses have until Jan. 1, 2026, to comply.
“That’s causing a lot of chaos and confusion,” she said.
The hemp industry is urging Ivey to veto HB 445. Gina Maiola, a spokeswoman for the governor, did not respond to a request for comment. If the governor vetoes the bill, the Legislature could override her veto, but it’s also unclear whether the Legislature has the votes. The bill passed with a 60-27 vote and 14 abstentions out of the House and a 19-13 vote in the Senate. 
Parasiliti said he is hopeful for a veto.
“The governor’s office just celebrated last week small business week, and here we are,” he said. “If this bill is signed and put into law, it’s going to be putting a lot of small businesses out of business.”
Cole said that litigation is being considered, saying that “the entire industry is looking at best practices moving forward, and litigation is being contemplated.”
“We’re just trying to figure out what exactly is going to happen and what is not going to happen before we really start doing anything, but we are discussing it,” she said.
The Alabama Policy Institute, a conservative think tank, also came out against the bill, though for different reasons, claiming on X, formerly known as Twitter, that the bill would legalize recreational cannabis use “under the guise of protecting children.”
Adding to the opposition, Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin posted a statement on Facebook saying the bill undermines progress made in cannabis reform and harms small businesses.  
“Alabama House Bill 445 is a step backwards and harmful to small businesses in Birmingham,” Woodfin said. “Instead of moving us closer to justice and equity, this bill risks dragging us back to an era of cannabis criminalization, overregulation, and lost opportunity.”

(Photo: Jeniffer Solis/Nevada Current)It was not too long ago that some formerly incarcerated people didn’t always feel welcomed in the legislative process, said Jagada Chambers, co-director of the Mass Liberation Project.
During the Formerly Incarcerated People’s Day at the Legislature earlier this month organizers, including those who have been previously incarcerated, were encouraged to make their voices heard on the policies that would impact them the most.
“The mindset of the day was trying to make sure our formerly incarcerated brothers and sisters know that is their house,” Chambers said. “They can go up there and feel comfortable.”
Organizers with the Mass Liberation Project traveled to Carson City this month to back a suite of legislation that includes  a pathway for incarcerated people working as firefighters to be hired after they are released, a bill to make record sealing easier for the formerly incarcerated, and a “second look” bill that would allow review of long sentences.  
Democratic Assemblymember Jovan Jackson, a North Las Vegas Democrat who in 2024 was elected as the first formerly incarcerated person to serve in the Nevada State Legislature, is carrying two of the bills.
Assembly Bill 321 seeks to establish a pathway for formerly incarcerated people to work as firefighters with the Nevada Division of Forestry once they are released. Assembly Bill 291 makes changes to the record sealing process for people with multiple past convictions. 
Speaking during a press conference at Formerly Incarcerated People’s Day, Jackson said what is “powerful is our voice” and emphasized that the stories of the formerly incarcerated can lead to change. 
“Your voice can make this moment possible,” Jackson said during the rally. “We need proactive means to public safety and not reactive. Once we invest in proactive means, we can heal and grow. We don’t have to incarcerate and invest in prison.”
Nevada in the last several sessions has made strides on advancing reforms to the criminal legal process and within the prison system. 
One significant moment was legislation passed in 2019 by which formerly incarcerated people can vote, Chambers said. 
That law then “allowed formerly incarcerated people to engage civically” which ultimately led to “Jackson winning his seat as our state’s first formerly incarcerated,” Chambers said.
‘Break the cycle of recidivism’
As Nevada contends with a growing number of wildfires driven by the climate crisis, like many Western states it has relied on the labor of incarcerated people to fight these fires. 
“Many of these individuals have gained valuable skills working on firefighter crews in conservation camps while in custody but face barriers to continue this work after release due to the lack of transitional support and employment pathways,” Jackson said.
AB 321 would create a training program with reentry support that would “help eligible people transition into fire fighting roles with the Division of Forestry,” he said.  
The bill would require the Nevada’s Department of Corrections and the Division of Forestry  to establish a transitional housing program for those incarcerated who are “within 18 months of parole eligibility to live and participate in skills development training in forestry management and conservation.”
Jackson said the legislation would help “break the cycle of recidivism” while also strengthening Nevada’s wildlife response.
The bill passed the Assembly unanimously last month. It was heard by the Senate Judiciary Committee May 6 and has until Friday to pass out of committee.
At its bill hearing this month in the Senate committee, Democratic state Sen. James Ohrenscall asked if the legislation, if passed, would open up the doors to other similar employment opportunities.
“Do you think folks who transition into firefighters for forestry might be able to move into careers with local fire departments as well?” he asked.
Paloma Guerra, a lobbyist with the Clark County Public Defender’s Office, said localities would first have to change employment eligibility requirements.
“To get your EMT certification I know there is still a barrier of having a criminal record,” Guerra said. “The reason the division of forestry is different from local firefighters is because they don’t have EMTs.”
Assembly Bill 91, deemed “second look” legislation, would create an avenue for those incarcerated to have sentences reviewed by the State Board of Parole Commissioners after they’ve served extended periods of time. 
The Nevada legislation also allows the parole board to “grant a second look review” for people convicted of Category A offenses, which include murder and sexual assault, provided the incarcerated person has served 25 years. For category B felonies, such as robbery and assault with a deadly weapon, they must have served at least 15 years.
Jennifer Noble, a lobbyist with Nevada District Attorneys Association, which opposed the bill, argued that “Lawful sentences should not be second guessed every two years each time an offender can file a new petition under this bill.”
Democratic Assemblymember Erica Roth of Reno, who presented the bill in April, said the legislation falls in line with moves legislators have made in previous years that recognize “that placing somebody in prison for extreme amounts of time does not necessarily meet the public policy goals, especially when they have been rehabilitated.”
“This is an opportunity for the board, who already makes these reviews on a daily basis, to consider a human being and who they are holistically,” she said. 
Though the bill is sponsored by the Assembly Judiciary Committee and supported by many of the reform advocates, it has not received a vote in the Assembly yet. 
The legislation has been declared exempt from deadlines. 
“We are in a battle for Assembly Bill 91, but it’s going to be a struggle because not everyone is buying in completely,” Chambers said. “There has been a great effort on behalf of the coalition to get us through the finish line.” 
Other prison reform bills lawmakers are considering this session include:
Senate Bill 88, which  seeks to discharge medical debt from those incarcerated once they leave prison. The legislation, which is exempt from deadlines, passed out of the Senate Judiciary Committee in March, but has yet to receive a vote in the Senate.
Senate Bill 323 would create a pilot program to provide free phone calls at Florence McLure Women’s Correctional Center, with an eye to extending the policy throughout the system.. The legislation, which was heard Tuesday by the Senate Finance Committee, would also prevent prisons throughout the state from charging more than the actual costs of phone and video calls.
Assembly Bill 246 requires NDOC to conduct a study on food quality, waste and nutrition within state prisons. The legislation is also exempt from deadlines and has yet to pass out of the Assembly.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DSC06426-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-14 08:07:42.408722

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)An Anchorage business owner, Republican campaigner and former talk radio host is running to be Alaska’s next governor.
Bernadette Wilson announced her campaign on Tuesday with a video broadcast from the steps of the Alaska Capitol and has filed a letter of intent with the Alaska Public Offices Commission.
She joins Republican former state Sen. Click Bishop and Republican Lt. Gov. Nancy Dahlstrom, both of whom announced their campaigns last week.
In a Juneau interview, Wilson said she’s disappointed with the condition of the state and worried about what it has to offer her children.
“I see the opportunity that Alaska has here, but I also see the lack of leadership, the lack of vision. And I feel I share the frustration of Alaskans. You know, we have people who get down here and they’re more concerned about keeping a job than they are about doing a job,” she said.
Wilson, a former competitive figure skater, was born on the Kenai Peninsula and raised in Anchorage. A parent to three children, she is the great-niece of former Gov. Wally Hickel. She owns Denali Disposal, a private trash collection service in Anchorage.
Wilson has extensive experience in Alaska politics, having worked on more than a dozen political campaigns, including the effort to elect Anchorage Mayor Dave Bronson and a 2010 ballot measure that would have required parents to be notified if a child is seeking an abortion. Alaskans voted for that measure, but it was later ruled unconstitutional.
She hosted a talk radio show with Democrat Ethan Berkowitz until 2015 and organized protests in 2020 to oppose Anchorage’s anti-COVID-19 precautions. 
In addition to her governor’s race, Wilson is campaigning for the ballot measure that is again attempting to repeal ranked choice voting in Alaska.
Wilson advised Nick Begich’s successful congressional campaign last year and previously worked as the Alaska director for Americans for Prosperity and for the Alaska Policy Forum, two limited-government groups that have opposed the revival of the state’s pension plan, among other issues.
She has never held elected office before, but said that isn’t an issue.
“Republicans love President Ronald Reagan. When Ronald Reagan ran for governor of California, it was the same thing. He didn’t come up through a bureaucratic system,” she said.
When asked whether she would continue Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s policies, she said she hasn’t been impressed with Dunleavy’s performance. The incumbent governor is term-limited and unable to run for reelection.
“I’ll be honest with you, I haven’t seen a whole lot of what the state has done in the last few years, not just under this administration, but under multiple administrations,” she said. “You know, name me the major infrastructure projects, name me the big things we’ve got going. We’re at the bottom of education, the same place we were years ago. We are in no better spot financially. We’re in no better spot with our education. Our PFD is spiraling, with people now trying to turn it into a welfare program. You know, I don’t think there is a whole lot there to continue.”
Wilson said she intends to actively campaign this year and listen to Alaskans’ concerns about the state.
“We are going to be out talking to Alaskans from now, clear on until — hopefully for the next several years,” she said.

(Photo: Jeniffer Solis)The Environmental Protection Agency has terminated a $20 million grant that would have funded the construction of critical water and energy infrastructure on the Walker River Paiute Tribe reservation in Northern Nevada. 
Nevada’s Clean Energy Fund was notified May 1 the EPA terminated a $20 million Community Change Grant awarded to the nonprofit to advance major infrastructure projects that would help the Walker River Paiute Tribe adapt to the impacts of climate change.
The grant is one of more than 780 environmental justice grants terminated by EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, according to court documents filed as part of an ongoing lawsuit against the Trump administration.
In the termination notice, the EPA said the objectives of Nevada’s Community Change Grant “are no longer consistent with EPA funding priorities.”
The funds have been frozen since March 7 when the Nevada Clean Energy Fund, which administers the funds, lost access to the EPA’s online grant management portal.
Part of the grant funding was earmarked for the construction of the Tribe’s Water Looping Project, which would have supplied drinking water to more than 100 homes and businesses that currently rely on declining well water. 
Between aging pipes, pollutants and regional drought, the Tribe’s existing water infrastructure has been stretched to its limits — compromising both public health and economic development.
If completed, the water infrastructure project would have also allowed the Tribe to build more homes and businesses on the reservation, creating economic development and job opportunities for the rural community.
The Water Looping Project has secured additional grants from the U.S. Economic Development Administration and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. But without the EPA grant, construction for the project can’t start, putting the project’s other funding sources at risk.
“They’re at a critical juncture where they need to keep moving that forward if they want to meet their construction and operational deadlines that are related to other funds that they’ve secured for that project,” said Kirsten Stasio, the CEO of the Nevada Clean Energy Fund.
Over the past four years, the Walker River Paiute Tribe has already invested nearly $2 million in planning, engineering, and permitting for the water infrastructure project. Before Trump took office, the Tribe had an ambitious plan to complete the project by May 2027.
The EPA grant would have also funded the construction of a planned Nutritional Wellness Building on the Walker River Paiute Tribe reservation, which would have served as a community resilience hub during power outages and natural disasters.
The Walker River Paiute Tribe also planned to use the remaining EPA grant funds to help Tribal members transition away from propane and wood heating by providing home energy retrofits for 150 homes on the reservation.
Nevada’s $20 million Community Change Grant was awarded under the Environmental Justice Collaborative Problem-Solving Cooperative Agreement Program, a $2.8 billion financial assistance program created by the Inflation Reduction Act.
The grant was one of hundreds terminated by the agency as part of a widespread effort by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to cut back on spending and dramatically reshape the federal government.
According to court documents, the EPA plans to terminate a total of 781 grants issued under President Joe Biden, including all grants awarded under the Environmental Justice Collaborative Problem-Solving Cooperative Agreement Program. 
Most of the programs and grants listed for termination are focused on environmental justice and include projects to help some of the most underinvested communities adapt to the effects of climate change.
Stasio, the CEO of the Nevada Clean Energy Fund, said she fears Nevada’s $20 million Community Change Grant has been caught up in a sweep of anti-DEI — diversity, equity and inclusion — efforts at the federal level, despite the grant’s focus on funding critical water and energy infrastructure.
The termination notice sent to the Nevada Clean Energy Fund suggests the grant was canceled after EPA Administrator Zeldin determined the grant conflicted with the agency’s “policy of prioritizing merit, fairness, and excellence” under constitutional and statutory law. 
The termination of hundreds of EPA grants also comes after the agency announced plans to fire nearly 300 employees working on diversity, equity, and inclusion and environmental justice issues last month.
Stasio said the Nevada Clean Energy Fund is now focused on convincing the federal government Nevada’s EPA Community Change Grant does align with the current federal administration’s priorities of energy independence, job growth, and critical infrastructure development for rural communities.
“We are working with EPA and urging them to reinstate this grant. The grant would support important economic development and energy resilience projects in rural communities in Northern Nevada,” said Stasio.
Democratic lawmakers have condemned the administration’s grant cancellations while lawsuits are ongoing over whether the EPA violated its legal obligations when clawing back funds through freezes and shutouts.
A day after the EPA sent out hundreds of termination letters to grant recipients, Democratic Sen. Edward Markey of Massachusetts — a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee — condemned the EPA’s plan to cancel nearly 800 congressionally obligated environmental justice grants, adding that Community Change Grants provide “long-overdue resources” to “underinvested frontline and fenceline communities.”
“The administration’s funding freezes have wreaked havoc on communities that are counting on federal investments to weather storms more safely, breathe cleaner air, drink cleaner water, live closer to green space, and save on utility bills,” Markey said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/walker-river-paiute-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-14 09:02:34.967064

But all these residents in this area of rural Jefferson County are afraid—fearful that their peace may soon be disturbed.
“Town is moving closer to us,” Jeff Lowe said last week. “And we’re not happy about it.”

Killingsworth, Havron, Rosenboom, Morgan and Lowe are just a few of the residents whose homes are adjacent to a 700-acre, wooded plot of land that soon may be transformed, through years of construction, into a 4.5-million-square-foot data processing center located just within the city limits of Bessemer, Alabama, a city of about 25,000 southwest of Birmingham.
If built to planned capacity, the data center would be one of the largest in the United States and could become one of the largest single consumers of electricity in the state. Of nearly a dozen residents interviewed by Inside Climate News, none expressed support for the project as planned. Instead, all shared fear and frustration over their inability to obtain information about the $14.5 billion proposal from politicians charged with representing the public.
Efforts by Inside Climate News to speak with public officials in Bessemer about the proposal, called Project Marvel, were met with silence. The mayor, his chief of staff and the city’s attorney all signed a non-disclosure agreement with the developer, staffers said, and would not be able to answer questions about the project.

Members of the Bessemer City Council, tasked with approving or rejecting the rezoning necessary for the proposed data center, have repeatedly refused to comment.
“I thought I answered your question,” said Carla Jackson, a council member who represents the area of Bessemer where the data center is planned. “And I was so sweet about it. Right now, while it’s under litigation, I’m not going to talk about it.”

The details on data centers

In the last decade, technological evolution has quickened pace, with massive data centers now in demand for more intensive computational tasks like cryptocurrency mining and processing artificial intelligence (AI) requests. That digital demand, in turn, has made its way into the physical world as tech companies search for cheap land, electricity, water and resources necessary for the development of large data processing centers like the one being proposed in Bessemer.
A data center is like a city with computer servers as the buildings, requiring network cables, power sources and cooling infrastructure, like roads, power lines and sewer networks in a municipality. Data flows like traffic.
Similar to the police and surveillance in a city, a data center also has security infrastructure—electric fences, anti-ram barriers, infrared cameras, alarms, lights and sometimes even guard stations and other surveillance systems to protect against attacks.
As of early 2025, the United States has more than 5,000 data centers, according to industry reports, compared to around 1,000 just five years earlier. And with that increased demand comes an inevitable, increased demand for resources.

Project Marvel

The proposed data center campus in Bessemer, if realized, would consist of 18 buildings, each larger than the average Walmart Supercenter, that would house massive server farms for data storage and processing. Located on about 700 acres of wooded land currently zoned for agricultural use, the proposed physical infrastructure would require the permanent clear-cutting of at least 100 acres of forest.
The company behind the project is a newly created limited liability company, Logistics Land Investments LLC, first formed in May 2023, according to records from the Delaware Secretary of State. The company’s registered agent is not a person, according to business records, but the Corporation Trust Company, also based in Delaware—an entity that has been used by large tech companies like Google and Apple for corporate dealings in the past.

Despite its brief history, Logistics Land Investments has already found itself in at least one legal battle. Court records show that company has been sued by the First Baptist Church of Red Oak, Texas, a place of worship that was located on land the development company was interested in buying for another project. After the sale fell through, the church sued, arguing that the company had wrongly breached their agreement.
The president of Bessemer’s City Council, Donna Thigpen, was the only public official interviewed who confirmed she had not yet signed an NDA. In fact, Thigpen said, she’d been largely left in the dark on the proposed data center thus far.
“We have not met with the builders yet,” she said. “We know nothing about it.”
She referred further questions to the mayor’s office, though she noted he’d signed an NDA.
The mayor’s office did not respond to several requests for comment.
The only information about the project made public so far has been in limited answers from the company’s attorneys to residents’ concerns voiced in planning and zoning meetings held earlier this year.

Those few answers provide only small, fragmented insights into what could be one of the largest capital outlays in recent state history. But even that information is probably more than is legally required to be given to residents, according to arguments made by an attorney for Bessemer in a recent court hearing.
“There’s no provision in the code of Alabama that authorizes the asking of questions, the furnishing of environmental reports or development plans or anything of that nature,” he told a Bessemer judge. “You have a right to be heard as to whether you agree with that ordinance or not. Nothing more, nothing less.”
The city had landed in court after a group of residents filed suit, claiming that property owners weren’t given proper public notice ahead of a recent public hearing on the proposal. Because residents packed the meeting room, the city argued in court, there was no deficiency in public notice.
Monica Agee, a Jefferson County Circuit Judge in the Birmingham division, issued a temporary restraining order on April 14 preventing the Bessemer City Council from voting on the proposed rezoning of the property from agricultural to industrial. After issuing the restraining order, Agee transferred the case to the county’s Bessemer division, where the matter was scheduled for a hearing.

Agee’s temporary restraining order was “wrong and illegal,” attorney Shan Paden, representing the city, told Bessemer judge David Hobdy at an April 23 hearing.
Hobdy scolded the lawyer for his comments about the judge.
“I take issue with the fact that you’re saying that judge knew what she was doing was wrong,” Hobdy said. “That’s a circuit judge of Jefferson County, too, so I think she had appropriate authority to act at her discretion.”
Lawyers for both the residents and the city of Bessemer brought up the size of the project in making their respective arguments about how the judge should eventually rule.
“This is a $14 billion project,” Paden said. “To give you the scope of that, the entire value of all the real estate in the city of Bessmer in 2018 was $345 million dollars,” Paden said in part.
Public officials should be judging the merits of such a project, the lawyer argued, not a judge.
Lawyers for the residents living near the proposed data center site, on the other hand, argued that the size of the project demands robust public notice and close adherence to relevant law.
“This is about protecting property owners’ rights to protect their land from money-grabbing AI developers who have devastated many, many communities across the country,” the residents’ attorney, Reginald McDaniel, said.
John Parker Yates, another attorney for the residents, reminded the judge that the identity of the developer and its potential client is still not known.
“This could be a Chinese data center,” he said. “And that’s scary—that could be happening in our backyard and us not know.”
In the end, Judge Hobdy chose not to dismiss the lawsuit outright as lawyers for the city of Bessemer had asked him to do. Instead, he told both parties that he planned to hold over the case long enough for city officials to begin the public notice process and rezoning process again, in accordance with Alabama law. If and when that process is complete, the judge said, he’d consider ordering a dismissal in the case.
Hobdy set a status update hearing in the case for Aug. 1.
Despite the delay in the necessary rezoning achieved through the residents’ lawsuit, community members opposed to the project now have another, likely more difficult task ahead: to convince public officials to vote against moving the proposal forward.

Marshalling the troops

Marshall Killingsworth walked in his garden on a recent afternoon, his daylilies blooming in the warm Alabama sun. Killingsworth, 80, retired after working for decades in IT at major companies, including Blue Cross Blue Shield and Drummond Coal. Even in retirement, though, he’s busier now than ever. He spends much of his time outside, tending to an elaborate, well kept yard overlooking a wooded valley where the data center is now proposed to be built.
Soon, Ron and Becky Morgan, married nearly 28 years, came and sat with Killingsworth. Ron, an Army veteran, jumped into the conversation as soon as he arrived, talking intensely about potential noise, light pollution and the environmental impact of the necessary clear-cutting and construction. Becky placed her arm on Ron’s leg. “We just got here,” she said, laughing. “Other people want to talk too.”

‘You can’t turn it off like the AC’

In Alabama, almost all the new electric demand that the state’s largest energy company, Alabama Power, has projected is for data centers, said Daniel Tait, executive director of Energy Alabama, a nonprofit organization that advocates for clean energy in the state. Many data centers use alternative energy sources, including solar, wind, nuclear and hydrogen, to reduce carbon emissions and reduce their reliance on the electric grid, although investors in the Bessemer project have not outlined any such plans.
Lawyers representing Logistics Land Investments did not respond to requests for comment.
As demand for digital content grows, an “arms race” has escalated between tech giants to build digital warehouses and bring their services to market first. Data centers were initially smaller and demanded 50 to 200 megawatts of power to run. Driven by the development of AI, a new, second round of data centers uses five times more energy, averaging 2 to 3 gigawatts to sustain operations. They are considered “high capacity” because once the center is running, it doesn’t stop.
“You can’t turn it off like the AC,” Tait said.
If built to full capacity, the Bessemer data center campus is projected to consume around 1,200 megawatts of energy and could feasibly consume around 10.5 million megawatt hours per year. That’s more than 90 times the amount of energy used by all residences in Bessemer and more than 10 times the amount of energy used by all residences in Birmingham annually.
Increased demand for energy, or at least the potential for it, is already driving Alabama Power’s desire to double down on fossil fuel investments. The company, an effective monopoly, has asked the state’s Public Service Commission to approve its purchase of a gas-powered power plant in recent days, potentially exacerbating the state’s reliance on dirty energy that contributes to climate change.
When a technology company proposes to a municipality to build a new digital storehouse, however, sometimes “elevated demand load is overstated because every party is financially invested in overstating the need,” Tait said.
Even as the city moves forward with its plans, for example, there is no guarantee the data center will have customers once built.
Jefferson Traywick serves as Jefferson County’s first ever economic development advisor. In an interview, he said that there are multiple potential customers engaging with investors about potential end use. Traywick said he’d signed an NDA as well, so he couldn’t say who those possible customers might be.
“I really don’t even know,” he said.
Ideally, data center companies should pay for their own infrastructure, but in practice, this often doesn’t happen, Tait said. The vast majority of these infrastructure projects benefit only the data center, not the broader customer base.
Tait believes building these operations “should not be on the backs of regular people to benefit the wealthiest corporations in America.” These corporations, he said, “should pay their fair share. If anything, they should pay more than their fair share.”

Brenda Small and her daughter, Brianna, live in a small trailer park just outside the boundaries of the proposed development. Last month, they were quick to express their opposition to the project. Small said her power bills are already approaching $500 some months.
“That’s ridiculous for one month,” she said. Small worries her bills will soar even higher because of increased energy demand from the data center.
In Georgia, tech companies and consumer advocates have negotiated and agreed that the data center operators cover their own infrastructure costs rather than passing those expenses entirely to consumers. Georgia has also been more forward-thinking about clean energy, Tait said. But Mississippi’s approach to cost allocation is a “free for all.” Last year, Mississippi passed a state law that declares anything Amazon needs to build is automatically in the public interest, with no Public Service Commission review. This approach is “the most egregious example we see in terms of a cost allocation problem,” Tait said.
Alabama law contains tax carve outs for capital projects, including a specific, 30-year tax abatement meant to attract large data centers. If approved by Bessemer officials, a tax abatement under the economic development law could amount to a tax cut of more than $500 million.

Not a drop to drink?

So-called “hyperscale” data centers like those used by Google, Meta and other large tech companies can consume hundreds of gallons of water daily and millions annually. Smaller centers use less water but can still consume a significant amount of a town’s water supply if not properly managed.
To cool the heat generated by thousands of servers in one data center, a chilled water system is typical for a hyperscale data center. The central chiller cools the water, circulates it through heat-absorbing coils, and dissipates the heat into the air through a cooling tower. The water then recirculates. In smaller centers, water can be piped to nearby wastewater facilities.
Lawyers for Logistic Land Investments have said in documents that the proposed Bessemer facility’s end user may choose to rely on a so-called “closed loop” cooling system meant to reduce water usage and waste, but it’s unclear exactly how that system will work—what the water demand will be and where wastewater would be discharged.
Despite the rapid construction of new data centers driven by the demand for AI, cryptocurrency mining and cloud computing, Alabama lacks a comprehensive water plan. Under state law, if you own land next to a river or stream in Alabama, you can use the water without a permit. Businesses using more than 100,000 gallons of water daily are required to file a certificate and declare the water usage as beneficial, but the reporting is largely self-regulated without meaningful oversight, and penalties are nonexistent for non-compliance, according to Cindy Lowry, executive director of Alabama Rivers Alliance.
Most states in the east have a regulated water withdrawal system, she said. Alabama does not. “We have virtually nothing,” said Lowry.
If different sources pull from one river, like the Black Warrior River, and everyone is filling out a certificate, “There’s nobody looking to say: ‘How much can the system handle? How many straws are in the system?’” Lowry said.
By consuming large amounts of water, a data center, like the one proposed in western Jefferson County, has the potential to become the largest water consumer in the state. Already, 80 percent of water withdrawals in the state are for cooling coal, gas and nuclear plants, Lowry added.
Often, utilities may not have initially planned for such massive water demands. With their high water consumption for cooling systems, data centers pose several significant water challenges for Alabama.
A data center can strain local water utilities capacity, increase water bills for existing customers, disrupt the natural flow of rivers, reduce the water available for downstream users and potentially destroy local ecosystems.
Dynamics like these worry Ron and Becky Morgan. The couple is among the few residents in the area on well water, Becky explained, putting them at risk of becoming victims of groundwater contamination—water used to cool data centers is mixed with chemical coolants—or more general water scarcity. “We’re on the front lines when it comes to water,” she said.
Jeff Lowe, a retired firefighter, said he worries about the impact the facility will have on the ability of first responders to adequately address fires in the area.
“They say Warrior River is going to supply it,” Lowe said of the local water utility. “But I don’t know if they can. They can’t even keep the fire hydrants around here going.”
Lowe said he also wonders about the additional fire risk posed by the data center itself, potentially replete with electronic equipment and lithium batteries, in a community with limited resources to respond to large, industrial fires.
“I just don’t know if they have the resources to deal with something like that before it gets out of hand,” he said.

The loss of the land

On the whole, residents fear perpetual daylight will replace starlight and the 24-hour mechanical whir of machinery will be their surround sound, drowning out the birdsong. They foresee the banks of Little Blue Creek and other wetlands being deforested, the lakes flooded with potentially toxic runoff laced with coolants and wildlife driven from their habitat.
David Havron, president of the Rock Mountain Lakes Landowners Association, is one of the residents who filed suit against the city, resulting in the restraining order that delayed the city council’s vote to move the project forward.

He worries that the nighttime view from his dock, just a stone’s throw from his back door, will soon be ruined in favor of a project that he believes will provide little benefit to his neighborhood or those living in it.
“It’s going to look like a sunset,” he said of the light pollution. “A constant haze in the sky.”
With less vegetation to absorb rainwater because of the clear-cutting necessary to complete the project, Havron said residents are worried flooding could become worse in the area, with runoff potentially filling the lakes around which many of the residents have built their homes and lives.

Then, there’s the risk to wildlife.
“It’ll all be gone,” Havron said. “It’ll run off. There’s a set of bald eagles. There’s deer and coyotes, racoons and turkeys and everything else here. It’ll all be gone … It’s going to have to be cut.”

‘We’re going to fight’

Not long after Ron and Becky Morgan had arrived at Marshall Killingsworth’s garden gathering, Mary Rosenboom came and sat down among the daylilies, completing the circle of neighbors brought together by the fight to save their community from an unwanted development.
A sales professional, Rosenboom said she’d never delved into political or environmental issues until the data center came knocking at the community’s door. Once she began to look into the potential impacts, she quickly realized this was a fight she was willing to join and, if necessary, help lead. Now, she’s become an accidental activist.
“It was absolutely an accident, but here I am,” she said.

Sitting in front of her was a brightly colored binder, filled with research on data centers, city governance and what the impact could be in her community.
It’s a hard fight to win, Rosenboom said, when there’s so little information being provided about the specifics of the project.
The non-disclosure agreements, the residents said, was one of their top concerns.
“When you’re dealing with public funds and public ordinances, there should be no NDA,” Ron Morgan said.
Even if public officials are unwilling to talk about the possible impacts of the project, the residents around the site say they’re ready for a war. Securing the restraining order and delaying the process was a battle won, they said, but the fight is still well underway.
Becky Morgan, also a plaintiff in the suit against the city, said that previous public hearings have been largely a formality, with officials doing little to meaningfully engage with citizens’ concerns.
“It’s just a farce,” she said.
And when it came time for officials to ask questions of the developer, there was little desire on the part of public officials to push the data center representatives for more substantive information.
“They already had their marching orders,” her husband, Ron, said. “And now we have ours.”
The next stage of the fight is already underway.
The last week of April, more than 100 residents gathered inside Rock Mountain Baptist Church to hear from lawyers McDaniel and Yates about what may come next.

The pair characterized securing a delay in the rezoning process as a win but warned residents that a protracted legal fight could drag on for years and cost the community upwards of six figures.
Outside the legal realm, the lawyers said, residents should do all they can to press local political leaders to oppose the project and provide as much information about the proposal as possible before and during newly scheduled planning and zoning commission and city council meetings in the coming weeks.
No matter what, the lawyers told the crowd, fighting a municipality with practically unlimited resources over a multi-billion dollar project will be an uphill battle.
It was a reality many of the residents were already coming to terms with. They were ready for the fight.

Pennsylvania is again ranked near the top of the list in the annual “Horrible Hundred” tally of states with the most dog breeders and brokers cited by regulators.
The nonprofit Humane World for Animals, formerly known as the Humane Society of the United States, recently published its 2025 installment of its annual Horrible Hundred report cataloging the most egregious regulatory violations as cited by state and federal inspectors of puppy mills.
For the 13th year in a row, Missouri had the highest number of dealers in the report, with 26 different operators listed. Missouri was followed by Ohio, with 16 operators; Iowa, with 12, and New York and Pennsylvania, with 11 each.
The breeders based in the commonwealth listed in the report are:
Tina Berkstresser/Mountain Hideaway Kennel, Waterfall: This past January, the owners were each reportedly charged with at least 14 misdemeanors for “failure to keep [the] kennel in sanitary and humane condition.” State inspection reports show the dog warden noted six different violations at the kennel, including issues with cleanliness, maintenance and bedding that was “soiled and dirty with an unpleasant odor. State inspectors also found more violations at the kennel in March. 
Christian and Sallie Blank/Hilltop Kennel, Gap: In May 2024, the dog warden ordered a veterinary check on five dogs at the kennel due to their visible condition during the inspection. When inspectors returned six months later, they issued a citation after finding violations for issues such as inadequate temperature control and humidity levels. In 2023, the kennel had two separate verbal and written warnings. 
Israel B. Byler/Walnut Grove Kennel, Belleville: The owner received an official warning from the USDA in April 2024 due to an issue with an injured dog. The previous month, Byler had received a Direct violation after inspectors found a miniature poodle who was not putting weight on her leg. He admitted the dog had been injured after jumping off a grooming table two days prior, but had not received any treatment. Even after the warning, the USDA found another dog in need of veterinary care in September 2024. 
Reuben Esch/Mountain View Kennels, Howard: During state inspections in September and December of 2024, Esch received two citations. At the December visit, inspectors found matted dogs, two of whom were “heavily matted.” At the September visit, inspectors found six different violations for issues such as high humidity readings, a ventilation system that was not running, and a lack of adequate veterinary care and record keeping. 
Elmer Fisher, Newport:  Fisher failed three different state inspections within six months last year. The most recent one was in August 2024, during which inspectors noted eight different violations. Fisher had three other violations in May and March 2024 combined. The August violations were related to housing, ventilation and veterinary issues. 
Sam and Ben Kauffman/Chester View Kennel, formerly Sunny Slope Kennels, Honey Brook:  The facility was previously called Sunny Slope Kennels. The operation was closed for enforcement reasons in 2010, but later reopened in 2012 and has had recurring issues since then. Most recently, the kennel was cited in late 2024 for enclosures “that were caked with dirt and grime,” and one enclosure that was not large enough; it received a verbal and written warning. Issues in prior years included another written and verbal warning for keeping dogs in such dark buildings that it was difficult to check on the health of the dogs, and dirty, unsanitary and unsafe conditions. State officials found veterinary issues almost every year between 2013 and 2023.
Elizabeth and John King/Sunrise Kennel, Narvon: State inspectors who visited Sunrise Kennel in April 2024 viewed “several dogs with abnormal conditions” and made a referral to the Pennsylvania SPCA over their concerns. They also ordered veterinary examinations on three dogs. It was at least the sixth time in five years that veterinary checks were required at Sunrise Kennel. Veterinary checks were also ordered at least once in 2022, twice in 2021, and twice in 2020. 
Naomi King/Lucky Acres Kennel, Lititz: During a January inspection, dog wardens gave King a citation after finding unsanitary conditions for the third year in a row. She had already received a verbal and written warning at their previous visit in November 2024. At both visits, wardens found accumulations of excreta, and accumulations of hair, dirt and debris. King had also been found with similar issues in summer 2023, when wardens found food and/or water that was contaminated with feces, not just once, but at two visits in a row, as well accumulations of excreta, debris and hair in the dogs’ enclosures and in other areas. 
Lavina Riehl/Springville Kennel, Kinzers: Springville Kennel has had recurring violations at its state inspections since at least 2019. In September 2024, the dog warden found “water bowls to be contaminated with dead flies,” primary enclosures with hay/shavings that were “saturated with feces and urine,” and accumulations of excreta, dirt and hair throughout the kennel. 
Lydia Stoltzfus/Oak Tree Kennel, Dry Run: Stoltzfus was issued a citation in spring 2024 after the dog warden found four violations related to issues such as a strong smell and “an accumulation of dirt, feces and urine of many primary enclosures where dogs were being housed.” However, when the dog warden returned weeks later, several issues remained, and Stoltzfus received a warning for concerns related to unsanitary conditions. The issues were not determined to be corrected until a third inspection in July 2024.
Mary and Benuel Stoltzfus/Mountain Top Kennel, Stevens: During a February inspection, Mountain Top Kennel received a state citation due to matted dogs. Iit was the fourth citation in as many years. Last December, an inspection had resulted in a citation due to an overdue veterinary examination and other issues. The kennel also had had at least two prior warnings from the state. Issues noted in 2023 included dogs who had been reportedly hidden on other properties that had not been inspected, and the warden noted that “when questioning the kennel owner about the dogs he owns he repeatedly made false statements about how many dogs he owned and their locations.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Wuanita-Swedlund-dog-in-2024.jpg,,,2025-05-14 10:09:34.099961

That’s over a million people—neighbors, families, retirees—subject to the decisions of elected boards that regulate everything from landscaping to lawsuits, budgets to property rights. These associations wield real power. Yet most of us don’t treat them like the governments they are.
Why not?
Because the real problem facing Nevada HOAs isn’t just overreach, legislative disdain, mismanagement, or unaccountable boards and regulators. It’s us. It’s civic apathy.
In a nation built on foundational values—free speech, democratic governance, rule of law, and private property rights—we love to talk about liberty and accountability. Fewer and fewer of us actually serve to protect them. We often only invoke those principles when we feel personally aggrieved, and abandon them when things seem to be going our way.
Look closely and you’ll see it: people defending free speech until they hear something uncomfortable. Demanding accountability only when the other side’s in power. Defending property rights in suburban developments while staying silent when low-income homeowners are displaced or unaccounted. 
This selective loyalty erodes public trust. But the quieter, more corrosive force is disengagement.
In Nevada’s HOAs, the most local and direct form of government most people will ever encounter, the vast majority of residents have never:

Attended a board meeting,
Voted in a board election,
Read their governing documents
Or volunteered for a position of leadership.

Even among those who are deeply dissatisfied—and that number is growing—most remain silent and inactive. We want better governance but don’t show up. We want more transparency but don’t ask questions. We want more options and fairness but don’t vote.
That’s how power calcifies. That’s how small cliques dominate community decisions. And that’s how fundamental rights—like fair elections, due process, or basic property protections—start to erode.
It doesn’t happen in a dramatic, televised collapse. It happens slowly, behind closed doors, while the majority tunes out.
And that’s exactly why it matters.
We don’t need to wait for the next scandal or lawsuit to take action. Civic engagement doesn’t mean becoming a policy wonk or full-time activist. It means showing up, staying informed, and participating in the decisions that affect your neighborhood, your investment, and your rights.
You don’t need to fix your entire HOA. But you can read your governing documents. Attend a meeting. Vote. Ask questions. Support a neighbor running for the board. Or run yourself.
Because when you don’t participate, you give your power away. And when enough of us do that, democracy—even in its smallest forms—starts to slip.
Let’s stop pretending our values only apply at the national level. The real test of democracy isn’t what happens in Washington. It’s what happens on your block.
Your HOA isn’t just a management company or a board. It’s you. It’s us. And if we want it to reflect our values, we need to start acting like citizens and owners—not spectators.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-921345552-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-14 08:07:42.408722

The meeting followed last Thursday’s mistrial of Christopher Schurr, the white ex-Grand Rapids police officer who fatally shot Lyoya, a Black motorist, following a 2022 traffic stop.
Schurr pulled Lyoya, a Congolese immigrant, over on April 4, 2022 for having a license plate that didn’t match the car he was driving. When Lyoya couldn’t produce a driver’s license, Schurr attempted to place him under arrest, at which point Lyoya attempted to flee. A struggle ensued, which ended when the officer pulled out his handgun and fatally shot Lyoya in the back of the head. The mistrial followed nearly a week of deliberations.
A round of intense comments from more than a dozen residents wanting justice for Lyoya and changes within the police department came after the city’s budget agenda.
“In our city, the police are out of control. As of right now, the police have no accountability and unfortunately, you cannot have a militarized police force that thinks that they are allowed to use force in that way,” said Micah Colby, 21.

“Under the Trump administration, the funding and militarization of the police is dangerous,” Colby highlighted.
As the comments in support of Lyola continued, some Schurr supporters in the back of the room scoffed at the speeches, generating some tension in the meeting.
Jeff Osborne, a man wearing a Trump polo shirt with the phrase “fight” emphasized his support for the police during his public commentary.
“The cop protected us from the mob during the protests. I just want to thank the boys in blue,” said Osborne.

As the meeting progressed, community members criticized the police’s actions and the lack of justice.
“It’s always the same thing. The thin blue line is a gang. It’s all across the country. I’ve watched as they’ve celebrated behind barriers, under those thin blue line flags after they’ve killed black and brown bodies,” said Kenneth Cortez, 37.
Towards the end of the meeting, when the commissioners were giving their final comments, they were disrupted by Lyoya supporters without escalating the situation.
“It is great comfort to me to have people up here who have a heart for justice and for trying to serve this community. It is very hard to not pretend we are perfect,” said Mayor David LaGrand before being interrupted by some residents when he was referring to Schurr.

“He [Shurr] murdered somebody,” was heard from the public.
The meeting ended after LaGrand’s comments without any incident.
Kent County Prosecutor Chris Becker has yet to decide whether he will seek a retrial of Schurr.

Missouri is the only state to operate separate day schools for special education, dubbed the Missouri Schools for the Severely Disabled.
The program serves K-12 students in 34 schools statewide, with anywhere from five to 60 students in a school. Some students spend the majority of their education as a MSSD student, concerning stakeholders who prefer to integrate students with disabilities into a broader student body.
The problems with the program go beyond a desire to desegregate disabled students. The schools struggle to staff classrooms, with a quarter of roles vacant.
And many school buildings are ill-equipped, with some missing gymnasiums and nurses’ offices. The schools have a collective $50 million in deferred maintenance.
“It’s important that we have to look beyond the status quo right now that we have in Missouri, and think about how we can reimagine MSSD,” said Mark Wheatley, assistant commissioner in the office of special education with Missouri’s Department of Elementary and Secondary Education.
For two years, the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education has been studying the schools alongside a group of educators, parents and representatives from nonprofits. Wheatley presented the work group’s recommendations to transform MSSD in a State Board of Education meeting Tuesday. During its meeting next month, the board will be asked to approve the plan.
“If the decision is that we just need to get better at doing what we’re doing now, we are already starting that work,” Wheatley said. “But some of these bigger levers that we have to move to make the program more beneficial for more students is going to require direction from (the board).”
The work group suggests closing 24 of the 34 MSSD buildings, six of which were recently consolidated in emergency situations stemming from poor staffing and aging buildings.
Following a decline in enrollment over the past 16 years, MSSD is using under half of the space available for students.

Consolidation would allow the department to better utilize existing buildings and renovate the aging properties. Two new buildings would be built, bringing the program to 12 schools by the end of 2036.
The cost of the construction is estimated at nearly $183 million, which lawmakers would have to fund.
The state would also have to invest in special education in public school districts. The work group hopes to create collaboratives of districts in rural areas to serve students closer to home.
“We don’t want to create a situation where kids are sent back to their local school district and the local school district is not equipped to handle them,” said Jacob Klett, an education advisor with Public Consulting Group.
Board members were largely impressed with the presentation Tuesday, calling the work “extraordinary.”
But Brooks Miller, a new board member from Sunrise Beach, questioned the longevity of the plan.
“Are we trying to design something now that’s going to take us three or four years, and then in five or six years, it’s not nearly the problem that we had when we designed it?” he asked.
Wheatley said he plans for continuous assessments and hopes to keep an active workgroup to continually study special education in Missouri.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/051325_eslinger1-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-05-14 08:07:42.408722

A decision to keep the birthing center open would show a dedication to the belief that the center is core to the mission of Copley.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  John Puleio: Birthing an opportunity at Copley Hospital.","This commentary is by John Puleio of Middlesex. He is a retired educator living in Middlesex, and is married with three grown children raised in Vermont.Lamoille County’s Morrisville-based Copley Hospital has developed one of the most successful orthopedic centers in the state of Vermont. This high-quality and sought after service has become a gem of this small critical-access hospital.A newly opened beautiful facility on the nearby Waterbury campus is proof positive that when a service is valued for its success and contribution to health for an increasing number of patients, the service can grow and become an economic engine for the overall benefit of the hospital. Appreciable salaries and generous bonuses demonstrate this success and allow for the sustainability of top-notch practitioners.Not all services within an institution such as Copley can be large income generators in the manner of the highly specialized offerings of orthopedics. Think of care for infants within early child care centers. Because of high staffing costs, this service is a well-known net income loser. Costs and revenue come into balance because care of preschoolers — in the same setting — is less costly. Not such a naive apples-to-oranges comparison considering that one keeps the other viable while the school as a whole is sustained.The critical and vital services provided by Copley Hospital’s birthing center could be the beneficiary of the success of orthopedics while adding to the continued viability of the hospital.It’s quite well known that birthing centers, particularly small rural ones, are not money makers. Never have been. That’s hardly the reason why hospitals have maintained such essential services birthing centers have always provided.Health care is a birth-to-end-of-life proposition. Birthing centers serve as gateways to future care and relationships for people that hospitals have an obligation to serve. If we look at profitability as the sole rationale to possibly close Copley’s birthing center, we miss the opportunity to grow the value, prominence and attractiveness of the birthing center. Like Orthopedics, it could be a brighter gem in its crown.Profitability is not the only factor that makes a center shine, and there is certainly room for growth. According to UVM’s Vermont State Data Center, Lamoille is one of the counties in Vermont that shows population growth. And from the Vermont Department of Health’s vital statistics report, Lamoille County had the second-highest birth rate per 1,000 residents in 2022. As has been widely publicized, the March of Dimes 2024 report scored Vermont as the only state with an A grade in maternal and newborn health outcomes.Surely Copley’s midwifery model — one of three in the state — contributes to this high grade. Midwifery care can be one of the safest, most cost effective means of managing pregnancy and birth. A 2023 Yale School of Medicine paper concluded “that many measures of successful pregnancy are elevated when midwives play a central role.” Certainly this care has led Copley to have one of the lowest cesarean section rates in the state. In truth, efforts to simply maintain the birthing center are not enough. Additional efforts to engage consultants to review all management practices and not just at the Birthing Center may yield efficiencies and savings.Moreso, a vision that puts full force into promoting the birthing center’s exceptional track record, improving the facility to make a beautiful space, honoring nurses as essential links to the vitality of our families, innovating to expand wrap-around services and fully marketing the birthing center can only lead to expanded use and prominence as a leading center of care.As a gateway and as an exceptional midwifery model, the success of the birthing center could well contribute to the overall value and sustainability of Copley, thus proving itself to be an essential community-affirming crown of multiple jewels, and a model for Vermont.A decision to keep the birthing center open would show a dedication to the belief that the center is core to the mission of Copley. A decision to keep it alive would highlight its exceptional care and its vital role and importance to the local community’s health and economy.This decision to save the birthing center would not be possible without a willingness to show a supreme commitment to the care for women, newborns and families, despite the monetary limitations. All of the above are excellent reasons to urge Copley’s board of directors to stand up for sustaining and growing the birthing center.Read the story on VTDigger here:  John Puleio: Birthing an opportunity at Copley Hospital.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Commentaries_featured-image-25.png,,,2025-05-14 07:04:47.478702

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)When Washington Lt. Gov. Denny Heck arrived in British Columbia last week, he wondered how he’d be received.
After all, the past few months have seen the usually strong relationship between Canada and the United States upended. Since January, President Donald Trump has played tariff politics with the allies north of the border and repeatedly expressed interest in annexing Canada as the “51st state.”
Heck and the Washington delegation brought a simple message: “We love Canada.”
Canadian legislators from both parties welcomed the envoy in Victoria and emphasized that they remain in step with Washington state.
“We’ve always had this strong relationship between Washington and B.C. and that continues despite the challenges that we’re facing from the White House,” said Rick Glumac, the province’s trade minister. “This is one man that’s causing a lot of turmoil, not just in Canada but across the world in terms of how these tariffs are being handled.”
To Heck, the reception was “incredibly gratifying.”
“Looked at another way, maybe this is just an opportunity to double down on our friendship,” Heck said in an interview.
Heck traveled with Democratic state Sens. Lisa Wellman, of Mercer Island, and Sharon Shewmake, of Bellingham, along with a couple of his advisers.
Their visit to the B.C. Legislature last Tuesday came the same day Trump met with the new Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, in the Oval Office. In the meeting, Carney made clear to Trump the United States would never annex Canada.
With their Canadian counterparts, Washington officials discussed the now-paused negotiations on updating the Columbia River Treaty governing the transboundary waterway and housing issues. Heck, a lead adviser on housing during Gov. Bob Ferguson’s transition into office, said he was particularly interested in B.C.’s regulations to tax outside speculators who snatch up homes and leave them vacant and limit short-term rentals.
The two sides also came to an informal agreement on how to organize an interparliamentary exchange to make such meetings an annual occurrence. Washington lawmakers last year approved opening such a dialogue between the two Legislatures. 
Heck expects to soon formalize that agreement. The goal is to “learn from one another, but the truth is, it has this kind of overarching purpose, I hope, to maintain good, strong communications, so that the deep, deep friendship we have can continue.”
Shewmake cited next year’s FIFA World Cup, the development of a new regional hub focused on hydrogen power and the fentanyl epidemic as topics she hopes to collaborate on. She also mentioned recycling policy as Washington embarks on a new program that puts more of the onus on packaging producers to ensure their products are recyclable — a goal for which Canada is ahead of the curve.
In the meantime, Blaine, in Shewmake’s borderland district, is dealing with declining sales tax revenue with fewer Canadians crossing the border, the senator said. 
Glumac pointed to the potential for a high-speed rail corridor connecting Portland and Vancouver, B.C., an idea that has yet to gain serious momentum.
And issues like wildfire know no borders.
Another piece Washington lawmakers could learn from is the unique question-and-answer period the B.C. Legislature reserves for members of the minority party to grill the ruling party, separate from floor debate on a specific policy.
“It’s a part of the opposition holding the government accountable and transparent, but it did not seem to be personal at all when all was said and done,” Heck said. He described it as a “different way to practice democracy.”
Heck, chair of the Legislative Committee on Economic Development and International Relations, led a trade mission to Canada last June, with stops in Vancouver and Ottawa.
The trip helped deliver an agreement between British Columbia and Washington for local wine grape growers to ship massive amounts of their grapes north of the border after a freeze devastated the Canadian harvest.
Members of the B.C. Legislature visited Washington for meetings in January.
Washington is a vital trade partner for B.C., with nearly one-third of the province’s exports to the United States going to the Evergreen State, according to the Business Council of British Columbia.
In 2023, Washington imported over $7 billion worth of goods, like oil and gas, from the province. That oil is often imported to refineries in northwest Washington for refining and then traded back to Canada.
Washington exported over $5 billion to B.C. Top exports include electric power, refined petroleum and seafood products.
“Our two regions share one of the most vibrant cross-border trade relationships in North America, and strengthening those economic ties is a priority we both deeply value,” said Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia Raj Chouhan in a statement.
“Lieutenant Governor Heck emphasized that British Columbia is a key partner for Washington, and that the State stands shoulder-to-shoulder with our Province during these challenging times in the Canada–U.S. relationship,” Chouhan continued. “I trust that Lieutenant Governor Heck left Victoria with no doubt that this sentiment is fully and firmly reciprocated.”
Gov. Bob Ferguson also met late last month with Craig Weichel, the consul general of Canada in Seattle. After the meeting, Ferguson wrote on social media that “both of us recognize, as neighbors and allies, cooperation and constructive dialogue has made for prosperity and safety on both sides of our shared border.”
Ferguson also recently met with the head consul of Mexico in Seattle to similarly emphasize the state’s relationship with the country.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_2138-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-14 07:04:47.478702

How much effort should we put towards a circular economy when deeper change is needed?
Read the story on VTDigger here:  PhD fellows: UVM’s Casella Center is a wasted opportunity to explore our compulsory consumption.","This commentary is by a group of PhD fellows with the Leadership for the Ecozoic organization: Hannah Gokaslan, Tom James, Em O’Hara, Matías Vaccarezza Sevilla and Dakota Walker.This spring, the University of Vermont announced the new Casella Center for Circular Economy and Sustainability, sponsored by a $1.5 million donation from Casella Waste Systems. The center promises research that facilitates a transition to “a more circular economy where materials are recycled to create further value.”As part of a group of graduate students studying ecological economics, the announcement raised some questions, primarily: What does it mean for Casella, the billion-dollar company that privately operates Vermont’s only landfill, to sponsor a center for a circular economy? It’s easy to think that we know for certain what waste is, and what it isn’t. We may consider it to be the leftovers or the undesirable parts of something. We throw it away, maybe sorting it into different bins before, and for many of us in Vermont, these bins are picked up and emptied miles away from our homes.But what we consider waste is a relatively malleable thing (remember the adage, one man’s trash is another man’s treasure?), and many forms of waste are hard, if not impossible, to manage, despite the waste management industry’s best efforts to quantify and contain them.Take PFAS, a family of “forever chemicals” (often found in high levels in leachate) that travel through waterways, blood streams, and root systems with serious and wide-ranging health impacts. Casella’s Coventry landfill generates about 12 million gallons of leachate every year, with thousands more tons of sludge imported from out of state which can also contain PFAS.The 2024 spill in the landfill, not to mention the discovery of PFAS contamination in nearby Lake Memphremagog prior to the spill, is a reminder that even technological advancements and environmental regulations often fail to truly contain these more amorphous forms of waste. The circular economy has gained traction in sustainability discourses over the past 30 years. Although it emphasizes reducing waste and pollution, the circular economy often misses the core problem with waste.The circular economy is considered a way to close the loop of resource use in society, envisioning an infinite recirculation of materials into production processes. The Casella sponsorship center at UVM is a reminder of the shortcomings of a circular economy, which is ultimately underpinned by a growth-oriented economy based on overconsumption.In a circular economy, waste acquires economic value rather than simply being seen as valueless outputs in a linear economy. Waste is subjected to the logic of supply and demand, and waste management becomes a global, profit-oriented industry that benefits from increasing waste production (contributing to countries’ GDP).By this logic, recycled/upcycled materials must be cheaper than raw materials to meet market demands. What type of circularity emerges when only the cheapest forms of waste can be recirculated? Are we moving towards a circular economy when we allow waste management companies to sell contaminated sewage sludge to farmers to spread on their fields?Lowering the cost of recycled materials requires economies of scale. In other words, consolidating waste management companies into monopolies, as Casella has arguably become. Making waste cheap enough to recirculate also means placing landfills where land is cheaper – often alongside already marginalized communities.Circular economy approaches frequently ignore waste produced before household consumption. A huge percentage of the resources that are extracted are already wasted or mismanaged at the beginning of the supply chain to produce our goods and services.Recycling is a resource-intensive process that still produces toxic byproducts that cannot be recirculated as “valuable” inputs. Critics see the circular economy as a new form of greenwashing, presenting solutions to environmental problems without fully addressing their root causes. Instead of focusing on technological and market-oriented solutions that only seem to make the problem worse, we advocate for a degrowth approach to waste management. What if we focus our energies on the very root of the problem: decreasing consumption? What if we focus our efforts on holding accountable companies that produce and design waste at the very beginning of the supply chain?A degrowth vision focuses on substantially reducing the creation and disposal of waste and reusing what is already circulating. It calls for a collective socioecological valorization of waste, which we do through community initiatives such as communal repair shops, voluntary exchanges, neighborhood-based organization composting and educational forums to design prevention strategies collectively.We don’t doubt that the new center at UVM will contribute to innovative research to create more sustainable waste management systems, an important step in the interim. But, how much effort should we put towards a circular economy when deeper change is needed? Understanding the variable nature of waste and the technological solutions’ limitations in handling our global waste is a crucial part of shaping a better future. This summer, the Leadership for the Ecozoic research group will be hosting coffee hours on Church Street to talk about degrowth in an informal, community-oriented space.

As a small business owner in Minnesota’s boating industry, I’m proud to help families get out on the water—whether it’s for fishing, watersports, or just enjoying our beautiful lakes. But a well-intended state law creates big problems for folks like me — and possibly compromise our ability to do business at all.
A key part of our livelihood — literally, the keys and key fobs used to start boats — is on the chopping block thanks to a law passed in 2023, which restricts lead and cadmium levels in consumer products. While the goal of reducing toxic materials is important, this law fails to recognize the realities of how marine equipment is built and used.
Unless the Legislature acts to remove keys from this law, it effectively bans the use of traditional marine keys and key fobs in Minnesota. That might not sound like much, but for those of us in the industry, it’s a game-changer — and not in a good way.
The marine industry relies on durable, corrosion-resistant components that can withstand harsh conditions. The small amount of lead in these keys plays an essential role in ensuring they last, fit properly, and don’t damage ignition systems or key-cutting machines. Finding a replacement isn’t as simple as swapping materials. It’s an expensive, time-consuming process that requires retooling and testing, often taking years to do safely and effectively.
And it’s not just manufacturers that are impacted — family-owned boat dealerships like mine are at risk. If manufacturers can’t legally ship us compliant keys, we can’t sell boats. Period. No keys means no ignition. No ignition means no sales. We’re not talking about a minor inconvenience — we’re talking about an effective ban on boating in Minnesota.
If not addressed, this could bring the entire industry to a halt in our state. That includes not just dealers like me, but engine suppliers, marinas, service centers, and every worker connected to recreational boating. And let’s not forget the tens of thousands of Minnesota families who rely on access to boats and watersports each summer.
The good news is there’s a fix. Legislators have proposed a commonsense exemption for keys. It doesn’t water down the broader goal of reducing toxic materials — it just acknowledges the unique needs of our industry.
Minnesota’s boating industry supports local jobs, brings families together, and fuels our summer tourism economy. We’re asking lawmakers to support these provisions so we can keep doing what we do best: getting people on the water, safely and responsibly.
Without this change, the future of boating in Minnesota — and businesses like mine — are at risk.

Bob Ferguson signed a trio of bills on Monday related to protecting immigrants in Washington state. (Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)Gov. Bob Ferguson signed three bills to protect immigrant rights this week. 
These included measures to strengthen state power to inspect private detention facilities, prevent coercion in the workplace, and prohibit bail bond agents from enforcing immigration laws. 
Lawmakers put forward the legislation at a time when President Donald Trump is trying to crack down on people crossing into the country illegally and as his administration presses to deport immigrants already in the U.S. without legal authorization. 
Here’s a look at what the new state laws would do. 
Detention centers 
State lawmakers have been pushing for greater transparency at the for-profit immigrant detention center in Tacoma. Previous efforts on this front have landed the state in court battles with the for-profit company that operates the facility, The GEO Group.
House Bill 1232 is the latest attempt to pave the way for the state’s Department of Health to inspect the Northwest ICE Processing Center and enforce compliance with state and federal laws there. 
It establishes additional standards for such facilities in areas like sanitation, ventilation and medical care, along with new safeguards against abuse. 
The bill also expands the definition of private detention facilities to include those run by nonprofit organizations after The GEO Group, which runs the Tacoma facility, claimed to be singled out under existing law. The nonprofit Martin Hall Juvenile Detention Facility, near Spokane, will now join the list of these facilities. 
Rep. Lillian Ortiz-Self, D-Mukilteo, sponsor of the bill, said she hopes this legislation demonstrates the state is not targeting a single facility. 
The law is effective immediately. 
Workplace coercion
There is often limited recourse for immigrant workers facing threats or being exploited by their employer. Senate Bill 5104, sponsored by Sen. Bob Hasegawa, D-Seattle, intends to give immigrant workers better tools when facing coercion in the workplace.

The bill would require the state’s Department of Labor and Industries to investigate complaints of coercion and would allow the agency to impose civil penalties when violations occur.
Coercion differs from retaliation because it happens before an employee raises an issue. Retaliation happens after the employee does so. 
During the complaint process, when a worker files a complaint, the department will notify the employer, but language in the bill was added to make a worker’s personal information confidential to anyone other than the department and the employee. 
“Every Washington worker can and should feel safe to report workplace injustices without fear of coercion or retaliation of any kind,” Ferguson said at the bill signing.
The bill would take effect on July 1. 
Bail bond agents
Following an incident in January during a public meeting in Sunnyside, a person claiming to be a “bounty hunter” said that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement would soon use bail bond agents to arrest people in the U.S. without legal authorization and pay them $1,000 for every arrest. ICE had detained two people in Sunnyside around this time.
Senate Bill 5714 would expand the list of unprofessional conduct for bail bond agents to include enforcement of a civil immigration warrant. The Department of Licensing could take disciplinary action against agents found to be in violation.
Bail bond agents already largely lacked the authority to get involved in immigration issues. But Sen. Yasmin Trudeau, D-Tacoma, said she introduced the bill because “people can operate right on the boundaries.” The law, she said, will provide clarification about those boundaries and the penalties for crossing them. 
It would also prevent agents from sharing a defendant’s immigration status with anyone outside their business. 
The bill would take effect on July 27. 
Other legislation
In addition to the laws the governor signed Monday, the Legislature approved a bill to allow immigrants to use paid sick time for immigration proceedings, which Ferguson signed in April, and a bill to have an expedited pardon process for those facing deportation, which is awaiting the governor’s signature. 
Lawmakers also maintained funding in the budget they approved for a state program that provides health care coverage that mirrors Medicaid to a limited number of immigrants without legal status. Ferguson has still not signed off on the budget legislation.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_2442-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-14 07:04:47.478702

That measure is part of an omnibus “Florida Farm Bill” (SB 700) sponsored by Central Florida Republican Keith Truenow that is best known for including a ban on certain additives like fluoride in the drinking water supply.
Psilocybin mushrooms are illegal in the United States for possession and sale, because psilocybin is considered a controlled substance. Psilocybin spores, the small reproduction units that get dispersed by fungi, are legal, however, because they don’t contain psilocybin, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.
As the bill’s House analysis says, “Certain mushroom spores and mycelium, which is a type of fungi, can be propagated and grown into mushrooms that have psilocybin properties. But the spores do not contain any psilocybin properties themselves and therefore could be considered legal under current law.”
A violation of the new ban would be a first-degree misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year in jail and a fine of $1,000.
Disappointing
The decision is disappointing to those who believe the use of psychedelic mushrooms can help people experiencing treatment-resistant depression. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2018 bestowed a “breakthrough-therapy” designation to a British life sciences company for its psilocybin therapy for treatment-resistant depression. The FDA designates a drug as such if preliminary clinical evidence shows it may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy.
Small clinical trials have shown that individual doses of psilocybin, given in a therapeutic setting, can make major changes in people suffering from treatment-resistant major depressive disorder, CNN reported in 2022.
That’s what led former Miami Beach Democrat Mike Grieco to introduce legislation back when he served in the Florida House of Representatives a few years ago to direct the Florida Department of Health and the Board of Medicine to study the therapeutic efficacy of alternative therapies like psilocybin. That legislation didn’t advance.
“Despite my legislation from a few years ago not gaining traction, we have seen throughout the country and internationally expanded acceptance of psilocybin and other psychedelics in the mental health and the therapeutic space,” Grieco told the Phoenix.
“It’s a shame that Florida has not taken advantage of the psilocybin redesignation by the FDA that allows for research and clinical studies. I would love to see our state make these therapies available to our veterans and first responder organizations.”
Grieco’s bill called for the Department of Health, in collaboration with the Board of Medicine, to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of alternative therapies, including the use of MDMA (a/k/a ecstasy), psilocybin, and ketamine in treating mental and other medical conditions, including depression, anxiety, PTSD, bipolar disorder, chronic pain, and migraines.
A significant setback for the movement to bring psychedelics into the mainstream of mental health care took place last summer after the FDA opted not to approve MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD. Instead, the agency asked Lykos Therapeutics to further study the safety and efficacy of the treatment, according to CNN.
As the House bill analysis says, “psilocybin, also known as ‘magic mushrooms,’ are naturally occurring and consumed for their hallucinogenic effects.”
Under Florida law, psilocybin and psilocyn are classified as Schedule I substances. Possession of psilocybin in Florida is a third-degree felony.
 Poor move?
Those who work in the psychedelic space think it’s a poor move by the Legislature.
“Florida is trying to outlaw the literal roots of the psychedelic renaissance — the mycelium that connects hope, healing, and nature itself,” said Peter Sessa, a lead organizer for Cannadelic Miami, a cannabis and psychadelics expo that will take place later this month at the Miami Airport Convention Center. “This bill doesn’t just ban mushroom spores – it bans connection, curiosity, and the future of mental health.”
Carlos Hermida owns Chillum Mushrooms and Hemp Dispensary, which has locations in Tampa and St. Petersburg.
“I don’t think lawmakers should be making the potentiality of something illegal,” he contends. “Are we going to start making it illegal because we think someone could grow up to rob a liquor store or something like that?”
Hermida adds that Mycelium is a fungus that grows in the ground. “This particular fungus grows in manure. Is manure now illegal in Florida? Is rotting manure now illegal. Is that what’s going on?”
There was no public debate on the provision during discussion of the farm bill in the Legislature. It consists of just eight lines in the 111-page bill.
In recent years, Oregon and Colorado passed legislation decriminalizing psilocybin and legalizing its supervised use. Cities like Berkeley, Seattle, and Detroit have also decriminalized the psychedelic mushrooms.
Calls to U.S. poison centers involving psilocybin among adolescents and young adults rose sharply after several U.S. cities and states began decriminalizing the substance, University of Virginia School of Medicine researchers found in a 2024 study.
Ellen Snelling of the Hillsborough County Anti-Drug Alliance said that she wasn’t that familiar with the measure banning psilocybin spores, but had a bigger concern about alternatives to psilocybin.
“A variety of psychedelic mushroom products are sold in smoke shops in Florida. An emergency room doctor told me he’s seeing more people coming in after using mushrooms,” she said.
Once the measure is signed by DeSantis, Florida will join states like Georgia and Idaho in tightening regulations on psychedelic mushroom spores.

(From the IEDC's LEAP webpage)After buying thousands of acres in Boone County to home a contentious technology park, the Indiana Economic Development Corp. (IEDC) quietly listed two purchases for sale one month ago. Prices for both are less than what state taxpayers paid two years ago for the properties. 
The Limitless Exploration/Advance Pace Research and Innovation District — LEAP, for short — has been pitched as a future competitor with North Carolina’s Research Triangle. Developers with the IEDC landed on Boone County due to its location halfway between Indianapolis and Purdue University, with access to a major interstate. 
LEAP spending nears $1B with projected budget shielded, investigation finds

As of October, the IEDC has spent almost $427 million on roughly 5,800 acres tied to the project. Initially the state planned to purchase up to 11,000 acres.
Both of the parcels — at 2009 W 250 N and 1502 W 525 N in Lebanon — are listed for sale on Realtor.com with the same real estate agent. 
In a statement, the IEDC confirmed that those two homes are the only two currently listed for sale by the IEDC. 
“The IEDC is in the process of analyzing all land assets within the LEAP District. As part of that analysis, the IEDC identified two purchased properties that were necessary at the time for access and annexation, but no longer warrant the state maintaining to support current and future investments. For these reasons, it has been determined that the best path forward is to list and sell portions of these two properties, eliminating maintenance expenses and better aligning with the long-term vision for the site,” said Erin Sweitzer, who oversees communications for the IEDC.
“To date, the purchase of land and the development of the LEAP District has resulted in the IEDC securing more than $18 billion in committed long-term investments for critical life sciences, (research and development) and data center projects, with resulting land sale proceeds already being returned to the state’s general fund,” Sweitzer continued.
 The IEDC as real estate developer

From the beginning, the agency has said its purchases will not be kept in the long term, but rather sold to the companies investing in LEAP. 
Eli Lilly, the first announced tenant, bought 605 acres from the state in April 2023 for $60 million, breaking ground on a $4.5 billion facility last week in the first phase of its planned $18 billion investment. Outside of Lilly, Facebook’s parent company, Meta, has struck a “tentative deal.” No other companies have openly committed to the site.
One of the homes appears to be just north of the planned Lilly site, a single-acre site originally purchased for $840,000. The three-bedroom home is now listed for $649,900, a 23% price cut. 
The other house was part of a 20-acre purchase for $2.8 million. The slimmed down posting on Realtor.com includes eight acres and the original four-bedroom home and sits just south of where Prairie Creek intersects with Highway 52 — a place the LEAP website said could be used for mixed development or a village center. 
In 2023, the assessed value for the 12 acres was $47,500 while the house and eight acres was $819,500.

Long-time LEAP opponents celebrated the listings as a sign that the IEDC is “reconsidering” the project after years of pushback. 
“I guess it tells us that they’re reevaluating how they’re doing things and … realized that maybe they shouldn’t have bought quite so much or bitten off as much as what they’ve done,” said Brian Daggy, a Boone County resident. 
Daggy and other members of the Boone County Preservation Group have criticized the project’s lack of transparency, maintaining that the state shouldn’t act as a developer and potentially overpay to purchase land on the taxpayer dime.
“I have no objection … if a farmer gets an offer and wants to sell property for development. It’s his property; he has that right to do so,” said Daggy. “But when the state entity, such as IEDC, comes in and starts offering huge premiums for property and using taxpayer money with no accountability, it really … doesn’t lend itself to fiscal responsibility or oversight.” 
Daggy said his wife and fellow board member, Peggy, is a former realtor and noted the listings a few days before the “For Sale” sign appeared on the neighboring parcel. Like other area landowners, the state asked whether they’d be interested in selling their property. The Daggys declined.
The state “clearly overpaid” for the home on the northern edge of the Lilly allotment, Daggy said, and was an example of the state buying property with no clear objective. Lilly, even in older maps, has been the northern boundary for the LEAP project. 
“I don’t know of too many properties where, actually, the price has gone down in the last two years. If anything, appreciation has accelerated,” said Daggy. 
But Lebanon Mayor Matt Gentry said the sales don’t indicate any slowing or pivot on behalf of the LEAP project, noting that the IEDC is still responsible for maintaining and mowing homes they own. 
“Maybe the IEDC just came to the conclusion of, ‘Let’s just resell these to someone who wants to buy them,’” said Gentry. “They were probably more interested in the land that came with the purchase.”
Gentry led a nearly two-hour city council meeting Monday evening, during which the government body accepted eight small parcels for voluntary annexation explicitly as part of the LEAP taxing district. 
“I don’t think LEAP is slowing down at all,” Gentry concluded. 
 What’s ahead for IEDC, Lebanon?

The IEDC has been reticent to share LEAP details from the beginning, citing a need to keep ongoing negotiations private until it reaches a final deal. 
“I understand the frustration, certainly,” emphasized Gentry. “But, unfortunately, that’s kind of the nature of these economic development deals. We were talking with Meta for more than two years before they were willing to kind of publicly announce…”
  Lebanon Mayor Matt Gentry
Gentry pointed to the $4 billion SK hynix investment in Tippecanoe County, where developers have wrangled with locals to identify a potential location more than a year after announcing the planned advanced chip packaging facility. 
“I’ve always seen this as a 25- to 50-year project, so I’m not frustrated by the speed of it,” said Gentry, who acknowledged the national economic headwinds may slow current progress. “But, at the end of the day, the concept of LEAP is strong.”
But Daggy tied overall transparency concerns with a governor-ordered forensic audit of the IEDC’s finances. Gov. Mike Braun, who repeatedly criticized the quasi-public state agency during his gubernatorial run, also froze funds to an economic development “partner” and the IEDC’s foundation arm, the latter of which funded nearly all of former Gov. Eric Holcomb’s international travel. 
Results from that audit aren’t expected for months.
Daggy also noted that the state-purchased land in Boone County doesn’t supply valuable property tax dollars to the City of Lebanon — coinciding with a property tax restructuring that will further dent future incomes for local governments. 
The property tax plan championed by and signed into law by Braun will curb future property tax growth with the explicit goal of lowering bills for homeowners but will cost counties a combined $386 million in future revenues. 
Boone County accounts for $7 million of that loss, according to a fiscal note from late April. 
But Gentry noted that the owners of newly accepted annexed land weren’t paying property taxes to Lebanon in the first place. Those dollars were paid to county and township coffers.
 Additionally, farmland — which accounts for most of the purchases — is taxed at a lower property tax rate. 
“It’s worth some short-term loss while the land is assembled and planned for,” said Gentry. “In the long run, it will certainly generate way more in property taxes than it does today.”

From the headwaters at Three Forks downstream to Townsend, the Missouri River is designated as dewatered. That just hints at the size of the problem.
Consider all the dewatered rivers flowing into the Missouri River: the Gallatin, Jefferson, Dearborn, Smith, Teton, Musselshell, and Yellowstone Rivers. Consider too the dewatered rivers flowing into tributaries of the Missouri, like the Beaverhead, Big Hole, Boulder, Powder, and Tongue Rivers.
The State of Montana designated these rivers, or stretches of these rivers, as “significantly dewatered by man-caused flow depletions,” mostly from irrigation, also from dams and other causes.
Smaller streams too have been dewatered, such as Hyalite Creek, South Cottonwood Creek, Bozeman (Sourdough) Creek, and Bridger Creek near Bozeman; Tenmile Creek and Prickly Pear Creek that drain into the Helena valley; and the Little Prickly Pear that joins the Missouri below Holter Dam.
These are examples, not a complete list, of dewatered streams in the state. Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks compiled the list because water levels affect fisheries, particularly spawning and rearing habitats.
Water deficiencies harm riparian vegetation and wildlife, too.
Furthermore, erosion is a problem.
Erosion strips fertile topsoil, clogs waterways with sediments, carries nitrates and other pollutants into our streams, and weakens the soil’s ability to retain moisture and sequester carbon.
Our activities affect sediment production, transport, and storage. According to a new study in the journal Geology, the magnitude of erosion caused by our land uses “vastly exceeds erosion rates driven by the largest climate transitions that naturally occur on Earth.”
Logging and plowing are the major causes of the human-caused increase in erosion, according to that study.
The loss of vegetative cover caused by logging — whether clear-cutting, thinning, or even prescribed burns — exposes soil to the drying effects of sunlight and wind, and this contributes to erosion, increases fire danger, and warms water exposed to sunlight.
Soil as sediment pollutes the waterways of Montana.
In agriculture, the loss of fertile soil, fueled mostly by plowing but also by overapplication of chemicals, prompts farmers to convert historically agricultural lands to development. The proposed Black gravel pit south of Gallatin Gateway is just one example.
Modifying streamflows with dams and dredging also increases soil losses.
Channelization of the Missouri River for transportation and flood control dates back into the nineteenth century. Dams for irrigation and power production further alter the natural stream environment and negatively impact the river and riparian habitats.
Yes, the dams also provide water for municipal water systems and recreation.
But the dams directly and negatively affect species now listed under the Endangered Species Act. The Pallid sturgeon and the piping plover are two listed populations negatively affected by the dams on the Missouri River.
But the population of interior least tern has recovered sufficiently to be delisted.
Adequately funded, conservation works!
More cost efficient is prevention. Stop logging national forests lands that protect our watersheds. Require the flow of sufficient water in our streams. Limit polluting runoff. Protect our water!

Fredericks has been proud of the center’s reputation in the community. Tree Top currently is licensed for 33 children at a time. With schedules staggered for some children, there are a total of 39 currently enrolled.
The waiting list is nearly twice that size: 72 children. This week Fredericks put up one pinwheel for each waiting list occupant on the law in front of the center, along with some signs. “Child care wanted,” one sign said. “Quality child care should be a right” said another. “Not a luxury,” said a third.
On Tuesday Fredericks was 300 miles away, at the state Capitol in Madison. Tree Top was closed, and Fredericks says it will be closed again on Wednesday and the rest of this week.
It was a tough decision, she said — but one she and her staff felt was necessary to make a point to Wisconsin lawmakers.
“Without state investment the parents can’t afford to pay rising tuition and staff can’t afford to stay at low wages,” Fredericks told the Wisconsin Examiner. “With investment, we will see a rise in teachers going into the field, we will see an increase in available programs.”
That’s why she and her staff decided to join the statewide strike called by child care providers.
Balancing better wages, affordable fees
The strike is a response to action May 8 by the Republican majority on the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee to strip $480 million from Tony Evers’ proposed budget. The money would provide child care centers with an ongoing monthly stipend, continuing support first provided through federal COVID-19 pandemic relief funds.
Child care providers have credited the money for enabling them to increase the wages of child care teachers while avoiding increases in the fees that parents pay.
“I know that there are many people who think that because we care for very young children that we don’t count as teachers,” said Tree Top teacher Betsy Westlund at a combination press conference and rally on the Capitol steps Tuesday. “But the work we do is highly skilled and deeply critical to our society, the economy, and our communities.”
She described a common suggestion that child care providers hear when they talk about funding shortfalls: increase tuition and expand enrollment.
“Never mind the tuition is already so high that so few can afford it, and never mind how difficult it is to find teachers willing to work for low wages with no benefits,” Westlund said.
“No one considers supporting the quality of child care by supporting skilled teachers because they assume anyone will do,” she added. “And that hurts. Man, does that hurt — because I know how much I have to put in to become educated in early childhood.”
Republicans favor expanding employer child care tax credit; providers skeptical

“We are not just babysitting — we are laying the foundation for lifelong learning,” said Amber Haas, a fellow Tree Top teacher.
The organizers of the strike are calling it “State Without Child Care.” They’re doing it “so that our elected representatives, especially on the Joint Finance Committee, can actually have an idea of what is going to happen this summer,” said Corrine Hendrickson, co-founder of Wisconsin Early Childhood Action Needed (WECAN) and the operator of a family child care center in New Glarus.

At the Assembly’s floor session Tuesday afternoon, child care providers sat in the overhead gallery. On the floor, Rep. Jodi Emerson (D-Eau Claire) introduced some by name, adding that they “are here in the Capitol to advocate for $480 million in the budget for living wages for teachers in early childhood education.”
While some providers are going all in with the strike, many say they cannot — but they are equally concerned about the issue.
Assessing the risk
Angela Norvold has grown her child care program in Hudson from a family day care  serving eight children to two centers, each licensed for 43 children. One is for younger kids and the other for older children, including 4-year-old kindergarten.
“We thought hard and as a team,” about closing for the strike, Norvold said in an interview. She and the center’s administrators decided to send a letter to parents asking for their input. “They agreed that we should stay open, and my fear was that if we closed we would lose those people for good,” she said.
There’s a child care shortage in Hudson, Norvold said. At the same time, she added, there are several providers in the area to choose from, but many have rooms that aren’t in use because they cannot find teachers.
“I don’t know that [closing] would be making a statement where we are,” Norvold said. At the same time, though, “we did have some parents volunteer to keep their children home so that we could come [to Madison] today and tomorrow.”
Norvold said that her centers were once more affordable than those in Minnesota, drawing families who moved across the border to make their home.
“They didn’t just come for lower prices, they came for quality care, educated staff that wanted to stay, and a community that values raising children well,” she said in a brief speech at the rally.  
The funding providers received during the pandemic “didn’t just help families, it helped providers,” Norvold said. “It helped us retain and educate staff, it helped us keep costs down without sacrificing quality. It helped us build futures.”
If the support doesn’t continue, “we’re looking at yet another tuition increase — at least $30 per child per week,” Norvold said. “That will push our infant care to a level that is not sustainable for most working families. It is not sustainable for us either.”
Families show support
Families of children enrolled at Tree Top in Ashland have gotten behind the center’s decision to join the child care strike .
“Our families support us,” Fredericks said. “They know that we have done everything. We’re contacting our legislators, they’re contacting our legislators —over and over again, telling them how important it is.”
Tony Singler is the father of three children who have gone through Tree Top’s program, from the age of 3 months though 4-year-old kindergarten. His youngest child is now nearing graduation from the 4-K program.
“Everything that Theresa does there is just more in-depth and more one-on-one,” Singler said in a telephone interview Tuesday. For his kids, he said, the center has been an ideal place to help their children through their first years.
“There’s a lot of research and support that the early years are very important to the children,” Singler said. “Our pediatrician supports that, and it’s a choice we make to give our children the best chance they have.”
Singler is a certified public accountant; his wife is a nurse. “We’re not teachers,” he said. “We don’t know how to teach kids at that young age.”
Now they are juggling schedules and turning to friends for help while hoping their child can return to Tree Top soon.
“It’s tough,” said Singler, but he says he understands the position that Fredericks and the center’s employees are in.
“It’s been a very good center,” he said. “And if they don’t have the funding, and they lose the teachers because the teachers have to go somewhere else, and they have to cut the enrollment and people get cut — then you don’t have the opportunity to put your child into the center like that, give them the best chance forward in their early development.”

A new study suggests that direct financial aid reduces parole violations and eases reentry. (Photo courtesy of the Center for Employment Opportunities)When Karina Lariz was released from a California prison in September 2021, she had only the clothes she was arrested in — stretched out and weathered by time. She had lost her home, her car and her job. Her two children had moved in with other family members.
“I didn’t have nothing, everything that I had within those two weeks of coming home was what I found in donation bins,” recalled Lariz, who was incarcerated for three years. She added: “I was so worried about, ‘How am I going to get to these different programs? Where am I going to sleep at?’”
After her release, Lariz spent two days at a motel before moving into a transitional home. She also participated in a job training program.
Then came an unexpected lifeline: direct cash payments through a nonprofit program called the Returning Citizens Stimulus. The Center for Employment Opportunities, an organization that offers reentry support and services to formerly incarcerated people in 28 cities, runs the program.
With the money, Lariz, 35, was able to buy clothes for job interviews, cover groceries and public transportation fare, and begin rebuilding her life and relationships. The money, totaling nearly $2,500 over three payments, helped her gain footing in the weeks following her release — a period often marked by high risk of recidivism and reincarceration.
“It liberated a lot of stress,” she said.
Now, a new independent evaluation of the initiative suggests that short-term aid may have positive long-term effects. The study comes as some states are considering whether direct financial support is an effective — or appropriate — tool for reducing recidivism.
In 2022, Lariz landed a job with the very organization that helped fund her reentry. She now works as a program associate on the organizing team at the Center for Employment Opportunities, where she helps others leaving prison.
Nearly four years after her release, Lariz is married and again living with her two children.
“If I didn’t have that support, I would have not pushed myself to do half of the things that I did,” Lariz said.
She is one of more than 10,000 formerly incarcerated people across 28 cities who received support through the Center for Employment Opportunities’ stimulus program, which launched in April 2020.










If I didn't have that support, I would have not pushed myself to do half of the things that I did.


– Karina Lariz, cash assistance recipient


The national organization works with local agencies to distribute up to $2,750 in cash over 60 days, contingent on participants completing basic milestones, such as creating a resume or attending a job readiness workshop. More than 80% of participants complete their milestones and receive the full payments.
People leaving prison often face staggering rates of joblessness, homelessness and food insecurity. Most program participants used the funds to cover food, rent, utilities or public transportation fare. Some participants also used the money to pay off credit card and medical debt.
“The basics of survival are this acute challenge in those early days of reentry, and then you layer on that sort of the big structural challenges,” said Sam Schaeffer, the executive director and CEO of the Center for Employment Opportunities. “Just putting food on the table, just getting to work, just getting that set of interview clothes is so critical.”
The new study supports that assessment.
According to the study — which was conducted by MDRC, a research organization focusing on poverty reduction — participants were significantly less likely to violate parole than peers who did not receive payments. Within the first six months after release, parole violations fell by more than 41%, with violent parole violations dropping by 64%. The study evaluated the outcomes of people who were released in 2020 in Los Angeles and Alameda counties in California.
Roughly 77 million Americans — or about 1 in 3 adults — have a criminal record, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. That includes records of arrests, charges and criminal convictions. Formerly incarcerated people often face stigma and major barriers in the job market.
They also often return home without savings or financial resources and earn less than half as much as peers who have never been incarcerated over their careers, according to a 2020 report by the Brennan Center for Justice, a left-leaning law and policy institute at the New York University School of Law.
 Legislation and pilot programs

A bill introduced in the New York legislature earlier this year would create a reentry fund to offer cash payments of $425 each month for up to six months for eligible residents leaving prison. The bill has been stalled in committee since January and is unlikely to pass before the legislature adjourns in June.
Some critics say that the proposed New York program is a redundant and unrestricted handout for people with criminal records, and question whether limited public safety funds should support individuals already eligible for state services, including Medicaid, food assistance, job placement programs and housing aid.
“This is just one more element of what is an overall theme by the Democrats here in Albany to coddle criminals and put their priorities over the priorities of victims and law-abiding citizens,” New York state Sen. George Borrello, a Republican, told Stateline.
This isn’t the first time states have considered offering stipends to people leaving prison.
Most recently, legislators in Colorado in 2024 and North Carolina in 2023 proposed bills that would have provided monthly payments to formerly incarcerated individuals. Neither bill made it out of its originating chamber, but both bills proposed up to $3,000 in support.
In Colorado, the pilot program would have offered money for basic living expenses to those who enrolled in workforce training programs following incarceration in a state facility. In North Carolina, the proposal would have provided monthly stipends for housing, food, clothing and transportation for up to six months after release.
Similar pilot cash assistance programs have launched in New Haven, Connecticut; Gainesville, Florida; and Philadelphia.
The Gainesville program, which ran from January 2022 to February 2023, had 115 participants. They received $1,000 in the first month, followed by monthly payments of $600. An impact report released in February found that participants experienced greater financial security, reduced mental stress and lower rates of recidivism.
 Potential savings

In 2022 — the most recent year with available data from the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics and the U.S. Census Bureau’s annual survey of state and local government finances — state governments spent $58 billion to incarcerate more than 1 million people in state facilities.
Forty-four percent of all state prison admissions in 2021 were people who violated the terms of their parole or probation sentences, according to a 2024 report by the Council of State Governments Justice Center. On any given day, 1 in 4 people in state prison were incarcerated due to supervision violations — costing states more than $10 billion collectively.
Some critics maintain that the most effective way to prevent crime is to punish those who break the law.
“We do not do enough to hold people accountable,” said Borrello, the New York state senator who opposes the bill that would create a reentry fund in his state. “I really don’t give any credence to [supporters’] thoughts on whether or not they think this is going to save money down the road.”
For people such as Karina Lariz, though, the impact is personal and profound.
“I’ve been able to redefine and find who I am today, like the real Karina — not the Karina that grew up in trauma and all the problems that I had before incarceration,” she said.

(Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)Republican lawmakers have filed a proposed bill expanding an existing state business development tax credit related to child care. Child care providers who want to see a permanent state investment in their work said the bill was an inadequate gesture.
The state’s current business tax credit for child care applies only to capital expenditures for an employee child care program. The proposed bill would expand that to include other costs, including operating a child care program for employees, reimbursing employees for child care costs and other costs related to child care benefits.

“These changes will increase the number of available child care slots and provide more options for families,” wrote Sen. Howard Marklein (R-Spring Green) and Rep. Karen Hurd (R-Withee) in a memo seeking cosponsors. “While not a silver bullet, these changes are another step in the right direction to address the child care issue in Wisconsin.”
Critics dismissed the measure as inadequate.
In a press release Rep. Randy Udell (D-Fitchburg) sent out after the Assembly’s floor session Tuesday, he noted that last week the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee “shot down 612 budget items including $480 million in childcare funding, and they proposed a childcare tax credit in its place that would benefit corporations instead of childcare providers under threat of closure.”
Shawn Phetteplace, national campaigns director for Main Street Alliance, sent a memo to lawmakers Tuesday also dismissing the proposal.
“Providing a 15% refundable business tax credit for businesses providing child care benefits will not appreciably increase access to child care for Wisconsin workers,” Phetteplace wrote. “It will simply be another tax break for large corporations. A similar credit exists at the federal level, the 45F credit, which is widely regarded as not achieving the goal of increasing affordability and accessibility to childcare for employees.”
Corrine Hendrickson, co-founder of Wisconsin Early Childhood Action Needed (WECAN), said at a Capitol rally Tuesday she would like to meet with Marklein, who cochairs the finance committee, as well as Rep. Mark Born (R-Beaver Dam) the other cochair.
The business tax credit is refundable: The credit recipient receives the full value of the credit back from the state, even if it is more than what the recipient owes in taxes. Hendrickson criticized the lawmakers for “refusing to do the same for our hard-working families with the child and dependent tax credit.”
The state’s child and dependent care tax credit for families, which was expanded in legislation enacted in March 2024, is not refundable. That effectively makes the tax credit worth much more to people with higher incomes than to those with lower incomes, as the Wisconsin Examiner has previously reported.
“We are not going to accept anything more that will entrench the wealthy and well connected into our system of having success in life,” Hendrickson said.
Born issued a statement this week that declared Republicans were focusing on other alternatives to the proposal for $480 million in subsidies for child care providers.
“Legislative Republicans have consistently supported a targeted approach to helping families afford child care, build provider capacity, and support recruitment of child care professionals,” Born said. “Parents are best equipped to make decisions about the needs of their children and Legislative Republicans are committed to providing parents with options, helping families directly make child care more affordable.”
Born said the Legislature spends “almost $1 billion” for child care. 
Hendrickson said that virtually all that money is from the federal government and simply passes through the state budget. Only about $24.4 million comes from the state as a required match.

(Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)Through April, state revenues are $97.7 million below the Idaho Legislature’s forecast for the current 2025 fiscal year, according to a new monthly revenue report released by the Idaho Legislative Services Office.
Although revenue collections are more than they were last year at this time, they are below the Idaho Legislature’s forecast for the current fiscal year, according to the April edition of the Fiscal Year 2025 General Fund Budget Monitor report.
That’s important because the Idaho Legislature used the forecast in the state’s 2025 fiscal year budget.

When legislators left the Idaho State Capitol in Boise at the end of the 2025 session, they were forecasting to end the 2025 fiscal year on June 30 with a positive ending balance of $420.3 million.
But just over a month later, the projected ending balance has shrunk to $322.7 million, according to the new budget monitor report.
“Thats why we left such a strong ending balance,” said Rep. Wendy Horman, an Idaho Falls Republican who serves as the co-chair of the Idaho Legislature’s Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, or JFAC.
JFAC is a powerful legislative committee that sets every budget for every state agency and department.

“At the time we adjourned Sine Die there were questions about the impacts of tariffs, and we gave more tax relief than the governor proposed,” Horman added, using the Latin phrase Sine Die that signifies the annual legislative session  has ended for the year “We wanted to make sure we had a cushion there to cover us – not only through the end of this fiscal year, but also carrying over to start FY26, and that’s what we did.”
“At this time, we are still very well positioned moving into the next fiscal year,” Horman said.
  Sales tax distribution seems to be main factor in state revenue picture 

Idaho’s budget runs on a calendar where fiscal year 2025 ends June 30 and fiscal year 2026 begins July 1.
For fiscal year 2025, the Idaho Legislature adopted a revenue figure that was $42.1 million higher than the revenue projection Gov. Brad Little and the Idaho Division of Financial Management issued.
Sales tax distributions appear to be a major driving factor in the revenue picture.
The state’s April revenue report indicates sales tax distributions to the state’s general fund are $95.6 million less than last year.
In a written statement Tuesday, Idaho Division of Financial Management Administrator Lori Wolff said she does not foresee the need for any holdbacks in the current budget.
With the April revenue numbers coming in, Wolff said the state is still within 1% of its revenue projections.
“The governor and the Legislature left $400 million on the bottom line as cushion, and we do not anticipate any holdbacks will be necessary for FY25,” Wolff wrote Tuesday. “The Governor’s Office and (Division of Financial Management) will continue to monitor revenue, but the strength of our economy combined with responsible budgeting do not create any significant concerns about the state budget at this time.”
 Boise Democrat worries cuts may be coming to next year’s budget

But Senate Minority Leader Melissa Wintrow, D-Boise, is worried that revenue cuts approved by legislators could lead the Idaho Legislature to cut funding for programs Idahoans depend on during next year’s legislative session.
“It may cause some havoc; in the next session we may see the Legislature cutting things,” Wintrow said in a phone interview Tuesday.
“Overall what I am deeply disturbed by – and what we are seeing in revenue collections – is I don’t think Gov. Little or the Idaho Legislature is keeping its promises to Idahoans,” Wintrow added.
In addition to serving as the leader of the Democrats in the Idaho Senate, Wintrow is a member of the Legislature’s budget committee, JFAC.

During the 2025 legislative session, Idaho legislators cut taxes by about $400 million and provided an additional $50 million in a refundable tax credit for education expenses including tuition at a private, religious school.
In a press conference Monday, Little said the state can afford the $400 million in tax cuts this year, but it’s important to consider the future.
To pay for the tax cuts and tax credits, legislators reduced revenue that is available for funding in the state budget by about $453 million.
Some of the Idaho Legislature’s laws, like 2024’s House Bill 521, divert sales tax revenue away from the general fund and put it to other uses, like paying for school facilities or reducing other taxes.
  Diverting sales tax revenue before it hits Idaho’s general fund

On Tuesday, Horman did say she is concerned about the sales tax revenue diverted away before it reaches the state general fund. She said she first spoke out about the issue a couple of years ago.
“There has been a concern as we continue to draw from gross sales tax revenues in a way that distributes them before they are appropriated that we need to be cautious that the percentage going to cities and counties doesn’t get so out of balance that when the next recession hits they feel the worst of the brunt of reduced revenues,” Horman said.
Wintrow is also concerned about diverting sales tax revenue before it reaches the general fund budget.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Instead of cutting income taxes and diverting sales tax revenue, Wintrow said legislators should push to increase funding for special education programs and increase pay for state employees.
Between the revenue cuts and Republican legislators announcing a new Idaho Department of Government Efficiency task force that seeks to consolidate state agencies and reduce the number of state employees – an effort similar to the Trump administration’s and Elon Musk’s DOGE process –, Wintrow worries cuts to programs are coming next year.
“Its not very conservative to hack your revenue stream so hard it potentially puts us in a place where we may have to continue to whittle at the oak tree until it’s a splinter,” Wintrow said.
“Many of us (Democrats), and some Republicans, really were raising the alarm bell on that, to cut revenue so deeply at a time when the economy is going haywire.”
The new April budget monitor report isn’t the first sign that revenues were lagging projections. Little’s budget office released a preliminary revenue report in March that showed revenues were lagging behind state projections at that point.
JFAC is scheduled to conduct interim committee meetings next week in Idaho Falls. JFAC members are scheduled to receive a general fund and budget update Monday.

(Photo: Anna Liz Nichols)Michigan lawmakers discussed the mechanics of a tax exemption that would put fetuses on par with children when claiming dependents on taxes.
House Bill 4202 would allow individuals who have a physician’s verification that they are at least 10 weeks pregnant by the end of the tax year to claim their fetus as a dependent.
It’s a straightforward “pro-family” bill, the bill’s sponsor Rep. Gina Johnsen (R-Lake Orion) told members of the state House Finance committee Tuesday. Johnsen said the bill would work to recognize the financial responsibilities that residents endure during pregnancy and promote growth in the state economy as families are incentivized to grow.
“This bill does not create a new entitlement. It does not expand government bureaucracy, and it does not affect Michigan’s legal definitions related to personhood or abortion. It simply applies the same logic and fairness we already use for children born or lost late in the year to a pregnancy that is ongoing under medical care,” Johnsen said. “This is a modest but meaningful bill that gives expecting mothers an added measure of support without creating a new program or imposing additional burdens on the state.”

Though bills to offer tax relief during pregnancy can sound like a positive thing for residents, it’s a common undercover tactic for state-level attempts to establish “fetal personhood” in order to chip away at abortion rights, Planned Parenthood Action Fund said in a memo at the start of last year. Other “fetal personhood” bills can look like efforts to allow pregnant people to pursue child support after conception and separate criminal and civil penalties for death of fetuses, placing the same level of personhood on fetuses as children.
“Legislative tactics and messaging of the fetal personhood movement may change, but the goal is the same — to control people’s bodies, limit their health care choices, and criminalize people for having abortions,” Planned Parenthood Action Fund’s memo says. “These laws are not about supporting pregnant people…Instead, they are purposefully sowing confusion and slowly chipping away at people’s rights to make reproductive health decisions.”
Rep. Sarah Lightner (R-Springport) inquired if there was room to adjust the minimum weeks required under the exemption noting that under the bill’s rules a person could claim the tax exemption at the end of the year and promptly terminate the pregnancy in the 11th week of pregnancy or beyond. Johnsen noted that the 10 week minimum was already a compromise.
About 93% of all abortions in the U.S. are initiated within the first trimester, or 13 weeks of pregnancy, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Rep. Kelly Breen (D-Novi) said she had some reservations on the bill but would be interested in seeing it tie-barred to only pass if the “Momnibus” package, addressing disproportionate maternal mortality for moms of color, also passes the Legislature. Breen proposed an amendment to tie-bar the bills, though it was voted down by Republican committee members.
“Thank you to the sponsor for recognizing the need for additional supports for pregnant women and working moms…There’s a lot of good that could come from the “Momnibus” package, and that’s why I’ve asked for this amendment to tie bar your bill to it,” Breen said before the vote on her amendment.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Facetune_11-03-2024-23-10-54-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-14 07:04:47.478702

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)The Wisconsin State Assembly, in a departure from prior floor debates this session, passed several widely bipartisan bills related to health care, including one to exempt direct primary care services from insurance laws and another to allow pharmacist to prescribe birth control.
AB 43 would allow pharmacists to prescribe certain birth control, including the pill and contraceptive patches, to patients 18 and older as a way of making it easier to access. Currently, Wisconsin patients have to make an appointment with a doctor or advanced practice nurse and answer a mandatory list of questions regarding their health before a doctor could prescribe birth control. Once a physician determines it safe, patients can take a prescription to a pharmacy to be filled. 
Under the bill, pharmacists would have to give patients a self-assessment questionnaire and do blood pressure screening. If there are any “red flags,” then a pharmacist would need to refer  patients to see a physician.
Rep. Joel Kitchens (R-Sturgeon Bay) said during a press conference ahead of the session that the process included in the bill is “much more rigorous” than when women get birth control online. He said it would also help women with family planning, noting that about half of pregnancies in Wisconsin are unplanned each year.
“These women are unlikely to finish school, and it will severely affect their potential earnings throughout their lives…” Kitchens said. “Birth control is 99.9% effective when it’s used according to directions and regularly. The lack of access is the biggest reason that it sometimes fails. Women will leave home for a couple of days and forget about it, or they can’t make an appointment with their doctor, and this bill is going to help with all of that.” 
This is the fourth time the Assembly has passed a similar bill. Last session, it passed a Senate committee but it never came for a floor vote. 
Kitchens said he thinks there is a “good chance the Senate will pass it this time.” 
Rep. Jessie Rodriguez (R-Oak Creek) said in a statement that the policy “will increase access to contraceptives, particularly for women who live in rural areas, where many Wisconsinites live closer to their pharmacy than they do to their doctor’s office,” and urged her Senate colleagues to take up the bill. 
“This is a good bill that will make for greater access to contraception. I have voted for this proposal four sessions in a row. I urge the Senate to follow our lead,” Rodriguez said. 
The bill passed 87-10 with only Republican lawmakers voting against. 
Primary care insurance exemption
SB 4 would exempt direct primary care, which is a health care model where patients pay a monthly or annual fee to a physician or practice for access to primary care services, from insurance laws. Advocates have said that clarifying that insurance law doesn’t apply to direct primary care doctors would encourage more providers to opt in to this model.
Bill author Rep. Cindi Duchow (R-Town of Delafield) said at a press conference that direct primary care “is not insurance.” 
“It’s a private contract you have with the doctor, then you have insurance for something catastrophic — if you need to have surgery or you have a heart attack, you have insurance to cover that — but this is just for your everyday needs, and it’s more one-on-one, and you have more personal experiences with the doctors,” Duchow said. 
Rep. Robyn Vining  (D-Wauwatosa) expressed concerns about the bill, noting that it is missing nondiscrimination language and that she would be voting against it.
“[This] is getting us nowhere helpful,” Vining said. 
The nondiscrimination language, Vining referenced, was in relation to prohibiting discrimination on the basis of “gender identity.” Conservative organizations had lobbied against the bill last session due to the inclusion of that language and it never received a vote in the Senate.
Vining expressed concerns that Evers might veto the bill without the nondiscrimination language. 
Rep. Lisa Subeck (D-Madison) said she had similar concerns but would be voting for it. 
“I think it is a good bill, and it does something that is important, but I do it knowing that I wish the bill could be stronger,” Subeck said. 
The Assembly concurred in SB 4 in a voice vote. The Senate passed the bill in March, and it will now head to Evers’ desk.
Lawmakers also concurred in SB 14, a bill to require written informed consent from a patient when a hospital performs a pelvic examination for educational purposes on a patient while the patient is under general anesthesia or otherwise unconscious. The bill was advocated for by Sarah Wright, a teacher who was subjected to a nonconsensual pelvic exam while she was undergoing abdominal surgery in Madison in 2009. 
Subeck said it is a “horrifying” story that Wright has shared every legislative session. 
“[Wright] was unconscious. There was no medical need for a pelvic exam and medical students were brought in to do public exams in order to learn the procedure because it’s easy as to learn on an unconscious individual,” Subeck said. “This is tantamount to sexual assault. This is not giving consent. This is assuming consent from somebody who is unconscious.” 
Subeck noted in a statement that lawmakers have been working on the legislation for over a decade. 
“It has taken far too long, but we are finally honoring her bravery by putting an end to this disturbing and unethical practice,” Subeck said in a statement. “Patients entrust medical professionals with their care at their most vulnerable moments. That trust must never be violated. Performing a medically unnecessary and invasive exam without consent is not only a breach of ethics — it is a violation that can feel indistinguishable from sexual assault.”
Rep. Joy Goeben (R-Hobart) noted that one study found that over 80% of medical students at major training hospitals reported performing pelvic exams on anaesthetized patients, but only 17% said that the patients were informed, while nearly half reported that the patients were rarely or never explicitly told so. 
“I am really thankful for the bipartisan support,” Goeben said. 
Assembly Minority Leader Greta Neubauer (D-Racine) said in a statement ahead of the session that the bills were a sign that lawmakers could work across partisan lines, but said they could do more. 
“It is possible to come together to pass good, bipartisan bills that will move our state forward — but we know that there is so much work left to be done,” Neubauer said. “Just last week, Republicans on the Joint Finance Committee cut proposals by [Evers] that would have lowered costs for working families and cut taxes for the majority of Wisconsinites. Removing these critical proposals from consideration and preventing future discussion is ridiculous, and on top of this, the GOP has refused to have public hearings, let alone votes, on popular and bipartisan legislation that would move our state forward.”
Ahead of the floor session, Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) told reporters that work on the budget is on hold until legislative leaders meet in person with Evers. Republican lawmakers are seeking a tax cut in the budget. 
“Our preferred option [is] to be able to get an agreed upon tax cut so that we know we have X dollars to invest in schools and health care and all the other things that are important,” Vos said. “It’s pretty hard for us to move forward… I think we’re kind of on pause until we hear back from Gov. Evers.”

The Idaho Legislature widely approved the new law through House Bill 134 this year. But the law doesn’t take effect until Jan. 1, 2026. 
The new law will require health insurance companies to cover supplemental breast cancer screening when abnormalities aren’t found or suspected in the breast of people who are at high risk.
“Early detection saves lives, and I’m thrilled to have helped pass this impactful legislation that will make life-saving care more affordable and accessible for so many Idaho women at high risk for breast cancer,” Rep. Brooke Green, a Boise Democrat who sponsored the bipartisan-backed legislation while she battles breast cancer, said in a written statement. 
Days after her first breast cancer diagnosis, Green’s radiologist brought the issue to her attention, she previously told the Sun. In a show of solidarity, several Idaho lawmakers shaved their heads in late March, as Green prepared to start chemotherapy.

 How the bill works: No extra patient cost for an extra screening in-network

Under the bill, people will be considered at high risk for breast cancer due to personal or family history, genetic predisposition or other factors. Supplemental breast cancer screening required to be covered by the bill includes magnetic resonance imaging, or an MRI. 
Idaho legislators shave heads to support colleague, raise awareness for breast cancer screening

According to a news release last week by the Idaho Department of Insurance, the new law requires health insurance plans cover “all costs associated with one supplemental breast cancer screening every year” for people covered by their health insurance plans who have a high risk of breast cancer. 
Here’s how that will work:

That screening “must be covered with no patient cost-sharing,” which includes deductibles, copayments or coinsurance, if it is provided by in-network health care providers, the Idaho Department of Insurance says. 
Additional costs can be charged for services from out-of-network providers. 
For other breast imaging services that go beyond the new law’s minimum service requirements, such as diagnostic imaging or supplemental screenings conducted more than once a year, the health insurance plan’s patient cost-sharing rules can apply, the insurance department says.

Idaho health insurance companies must update their plan documents and notify members about the new benefits, according to new guidance to insurers from the Idaho Department of Insurance. 
“Consumers should contact their insurer with any questions, or contact our department if they experience coverage issues,” Idaho Department of Insurance Market Oversight Bureau Chief Shannon Hohl said in a written statement. “Our consumer affairs team is available to help with insurance questions and concerns.”
In a written statement, Idaho Department of Insurance Director Dean Cameron thanked the Legislature and several lawmakers for supporting the bill, saying it will “help Idahoans access the critical preventive services they need.”

This is the first annual terminated pregnancy report in which the state’s near-total abortion ban was in full effect. 
Ninety-three of the abortions were performed due to lethal fetal anomaly; 40 were due to serious health risk or life of the mother and nine were due to rape or incest.
More than half were performed by using an abortion pill or intracardiac injections.The rest were surgical procedures. 
In 2023, while the ban was partially in effect, there were a total of 4,579 abortions performed in Indiana. Before the ban was in effect in 2022, there were a total of 9,529 abortions. 
Half of the women who obtained an abortion were between the ages of 25-34 while only two were under the age of 16. Nearly half of the women indicated they were married. 
Under the state’s ban, abortions can only be done in hospitals.

Nine hospitals in Marion, Allen and St. Joseph counties carried out the abortions. There were 67 terminations reported at Riley Health Maternity Tower and 52 reported at Sidney & Lois Eskanazi Hospital. Both of these hospitals are located in Indianapolis. 
Indiana law requires that health care providers who perform terminated pregnancies report to the IDOH. Providers must report within 30 days if the patient is 16 or older and within three days if younger than 16. Each of the reports should include demographic, medical and procedural information. 
While 142 terminated pregnancies reports were submitted to the IDOH through the electronic reporting system, Indiana University Health submitted four incomplete reports via email that lacked demographic, medical and procedural details. The reports did include that they occurred at an IU Health facility in 2024 but did not report all the required information.  
Two doctors from IU Health testified in March that they haven’t submitted the reports since Dec. 23 — when a new federal rule on reproductive health care privacy went into effect.
In January, Indiana Gov. Mike Braun signed new executive orders on abortion records to ensure the laws are “fully and faithfully executed,” including terminated pregnancy report submissions. 
In February, the Indiana Department of Health settled with an anti-abortion group – backed by Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita – to continue to release individual reports filed on abortion after opting to no longer release these reports due to patient privacy concerns in December 2023.
A judge, however, blocked that release.

Although mysterious water color cleared up over the course of winter, Little Soda Lake is already dealing with water quality issues.
The post Post-thaw, Pinedale’s red lake quickly tagged as Wyoming’s first ‘harmful’ cyanobacteria bloom of 2025 appeared first on WyoFile .","A once-prized trout fishery in the Pinedale area that raised concerns in late 2024 when it turned the color of a taconite tailings pond is again struggling with water quality. 
The ice just came off many lakes along the Wind River Range’s western front, including Little Soda Lake, which shed its deep red color over the winter. Yet almost immediately — within just a few weeks at most — environmental regulators detected potential issues with the still-frigid water. Samples were taken by the Bridger-Teton National Forest last week, and results just came in. 
“A harmful cyanobacteria bloom recreational use bloom advisory has been issued for Little Soda Lake,” Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality officials announced in a public notice Monday. 
Notably, the bloom detected in the high-elevation water body, located at 7,600 feet and just a half-mile from crystal clear Fremont Lake, marks Wyoming’s first verified harmful cyanobacteria bloom of 2025, according to the state’s monitoring website.

Harmful cyanobacteria blooms are often associated with warm weather and nutrient pollution, like runoff from agricultural operations, though they can also plague the backcountry. Occurrences typically pick up pace late in the summer and early fall. 
While Little Soda Lake harboring Wyoming’s first harmful cyanobacteria bloom of the year is surprising, it’s unclear if the potentially toxic water is a remnant from last year. 
“It’s unknown, but a warmer-than-average winter combined with recent warm weather may be contributing to conditions that allow HCBs to appear earlier than usual,” DEQ spokeswoman Kimberly Mazza wrote in an email.

DEQ was able to acquire a cyanotoxin sample, Mazza said. Results are pending, but eventually the sample will give the state agency more insight into the toxicity of the cyanobacteria suspected to be a factor in Little Soda Lake’s crimson color. 
Land managers and environmental regulators should learn a lot about what’s going on in Little Soda Lake in 2025. The water body will be sampled monthly, according to DEQ’s 2025 sampling and analysis plan. 
Routine monthly monitoring is typically reserved for lakes that have “high to very high” access and recreational use and toxic bloom potential. Exceptions were made for Brooks Lake and Little Soda Lake.
“These waterbodies were classified as very high priority due to significant public interest,” DEQ’s plan says.

Political parties should stand on their own two feet, and not come running to government to referee their frat-house pissing matches, columnist Rod Miller opines. 
The post It’s high time for Wyoming to privatize political parties appeared first on WyoFile .","It has become a predictable annual event, like the first tourist getting tossed ass over teacup by a Yellowstone buffalo. It is the “free space” on the Cowboy State’s political bingo card. I am, of course, talking about the Wyoming Republican Party getting into an intramural food fight, and then coming to the government of Wyoming to sort things out.

Opinion

I see that the Wyoming Republican Party is suing itself again in our state courts, this time over credentials in the state Central Committee leadership elections. The attorney for the GOP went so far as to say that, since the party is a private organization, it doesn’t need to abide by Wyoming statutes or pay attention to Wyoming Supreme Court decisions.
The irony in this situation is thick as harness leather.
At the risk of repeating myself, I’ll repeat myself. The sovereign State of Wyoming needs to cut the apron strings that bind political parties to state government. The Wyoming Legislature should go through Title 22, our election code, with a fine-toothed comb, and pluck out any reference to political parties contained therein.
It makes absolutely no sense to have laws on our books that govern the internal workings of private organizations like political parties, and then have those parties ignore the law. The State of Wyoming doesn’t tell the Rotary Club how to conduct its internal elections, any more than it tells the Elks Club what to include on its buffet menu.
Political parties, like service clubs or lodges, are private membership organizations and should be allowed to conduct their business by their own rules. Government has no place monkeying around in them, unless their rituals involve human sacrifice or fissionable material.
Private political parties should also stand on their own two feet, and not come running to government to referee their frat-house pissing matches. When they resort to appealing to government to settle their internal differences, political parties make themselves look like weak little wards of the state who can’t handle disputes among themselves, instead of the proud paragons of political thought that they like to call themselves.
Here, as I see it, is the only nexus between political parties in Wyoming and government. The parties can, if they choose to do so, submit a slate of candidates to the Secretary of State and county clerks for inclusion on the general election ballot. Once that is done, the relationship is over. Basta. Finito. End of story.
How the parties derive those names should be totally up to them. There is no need for government to conduct primary elections at public expense to accommodate private organizations such as political parties.
If the Democrats want to have an axe-throwing tournament to choose their candidates, then so be it. If the Republicans want to conduct a swimsuit competition to choose theirs, fine and dandy. It is not government’s business to interfere.
And this nonsense about the parties controlling vacant seats in government by submitting three names to the governor for selection needs to go! Those seats belong to the citizens of Wyoming, not to any political party. If a seat becomes vacant, then a special election should be held to fill it. Let voters decide, not party hacks.
Political parties are useless appendages on our body politic. They have meaning only to their members and, outside that small circle, they only offer entertainment value to the rest of us.
Wyoming’s state lawmakers would do everyone a favor if they’d re-read Madison’s cautionary advice about political factions in the Federalist Papers #10, then take a chainsaw to our election code. Free the parties to be the private outfits they want to be, and liberate the rest of us from their partisan goofiness.
Selah.

(Photo via ICE)Wisconsin Republicans continued their push Tuesday for a bill that would require local law enforcement to report people charged with a felony to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) if they cannot verify their immigration status. Legislative leaders are also demanding that state government officials cooperate with and support President Donald Trump’s deportation agenda.
State legislatures across the country have taken action to either require or prohibit local law enforcement cooperation. According to a Stateline report, experts have said jails are the easiest place to pick up people for deportation and when local law enforcement cooperates there are more arrests. Noncooperation in states, including California, is leading to a decreased number of arrests and deportations.
Amanda Merkwae, advocacy director for the ACLU of Wisconsin,  testified against the legislation before the Senate Licensing, Regulatory Reform, State and Federal Affairs Committee Tuesday. Merkwae detailed extensive actions the Trump administration has taken to target immigrants since the bill was first introduced by lawmakers and cautioned against having local law enforcement play a larger role in those efforts.
Merkwae quoted a former North Carolina sheriff who said at a 2008 conference about the role of local police in immigration enforcement, “if you don’t have enough evidence to charge someone criminally, but you think he’s illegal, we can make him disappear.”
“A lot has happened even since the Assembly public hearing on this bill back in February,” Merkwae said, reeling off a list including “the disappearing of legal residents to gulags without due process,” “inappropriately invoking the Alien Enemies Act to remove people,” to “escalating violent arrests” by masked Department of Homeland Security agents, detaining students and activists for exercising their First Amendment rights in ICE facilities, arbitrarily canceling student visas, “threatening to disappear U.S. citizens to El Salvador,” “and just this week — and it’s only Tuesday — eliminating temporary protective status of thousands of immigrants despite a court order, blocking the entry of refugees who spent years getting approved through a lengthy process while living in refugee camps and third countries and the administration openly exploring the suspension of habeas corpus.”
“When the federal government is violating the Constitution, we must resist pressures to integrate local governance into its abuses,” she said. 
The Assembly passed the bill in March along party lines, and Gov. Tony Evers has vowed to veto it. Lawmakers introduced the bill just three weeks into Trump’s new term.
Sen. Julian Bradley (R-New Berlin) and Rep. Jim Piwowarczyk (R-Hubertus) said the bill is narrow and seeks to help ensure that Wisconsin is safe.
“This proposal will make it easier to remove dangerous criminals from our communities. It’s shocking to think that a handful in law enforcement and our government would rather protect felons than work with our federal partners to stop the flow of crime and drugs into our neighborhoods,” Bradley said. 
Since March, the number of Wisconsin counties with official agreements to cooperate with ICE has grown to 12, including Washington, Waupaca, Winnebago and Wood. Two counties — Dane and Milwaukee — have previously been identified by ICE as noncooperative. 
Milwaukee County has become a focal point of controversy over ICE cooperation. Milwaukee County Judge Hannah Dugan was arrested and indicted on charges of obstructing federal agents and concealing a person to prevent an arrest. ICE has arrested at least four people since March at the Milwaukee County Courthouse. Republicans have also accused Evers of being noncooperative after he told state employees to contact a lawyer before handing over information if ICE showed up at their office buildings.
“I am deeply concerned that some local jurisdictions, including Dane County and Milwaukee County, have severely limited their cooperation with ICE. Many, if not most, Wisconsin sheriffs are already doing everything they can to identify the legal immigrants in their jails and cooperate with ICE holds,” Piwowarczyk said. “This bill won’t affect them. It will affect those who refuse, imperiling the safety of all Wisconsin citizens.”
The bill — AB 24 — would require local law enforcement to check the citizenship status of people in custody for  felony offenses and notify ICE if their citizenship can’t be verified. It also requires sheriffs to comply with detainers and administrative warrants received from the Department of Homeland Security regarding people held in the county jail for a criminal offense. If a sheriff refuses to comply with the law, the county would face a 15% deduction in its state aid payment the following year.
Merkwae said that the bill authors were taking a narrow reading of the bill, but “with 15% of an entire county’s share revenues on the line,” this will lead to sheriffs erring on the “side of overreporting.”
Democrats on the committee had an array of concerns about the bills, especially given the actions that the Trump administration has taken since the start of his term. 
Larson asked lawmakers whether they trusted ICE. 
“You’re throwing your trust in ICE — that 10 out of 10 [times] ICE is doing the right thing, 10 out of 10 times ICE is only taking people who have committed felonies and following the guidance of the president,” Larson said. “I don’t trust this federal government because [President Trump] came out on the record and said, ‘I don’t know if people deserve due process, I don’t know if I’m supposed to uphold the Constitution.’ Those are the words of the person who’s in charge of the administration.” 
Bradley said he rejected the premise of Larson’s question. 
“We aren’t empowering ICE,” Bradley said. “We don’t have the power to empower ICE. That’s not what we’re doing. We’re telling the sheriffs to cooperate with the federal government as they’re required to because we have instances where people have publicly come out and said, we will not cooperate… In this bill, [people] have also committed and are being charged with a felony. That’s what this bill is about.”
Larson corrected lawmakers several times when they said the only people covered in the bill had committed a crime: “75 of the people shipped overseas to El Salvador prison have no criminal history, and so this seems like an effort to jump on that bandwagon.” 
“Accused,” Larson said at one point. “Accused. You keep forgetting that part — alleged.” 
Sen. Tim Carpenter (D-Milwaukee) said he also doesn’t trust the current system, especially as ICE isn’t being transparent about its work. 
“It seems like it’s more of a campaign pitch to grab as many people as you can, but there are people that are innocent,” Carpenter said, adding that he fears that the bill if passed is “legitimizing a system that is not doing what we wanted it to do.”
Carpenter noted he has the largest Latino population among Wisconsin Senate districts. From events hosted in the district and conversations with constituents, he said, it’s “very noticeable that people are scared, and they don’t want to have someone — they’re innocent and get caught up in the system and end up in El Salvador.” 
Carpenter told the bill authors to try to convince him that the bill won’t further affect those communities.
“How do we deal with that impact on a sizable community — many of whom have done nothing wrong?” Carpenter asked. 
“I think the best thing that could happen is if people were honest about what this bill does, because by not being honest or conflating issues, what we’re doing is we’re spreading that fear,” Bradley said. “So, if you are here illegally and you are being charged with a felony, this bill, this applies to you, and you should be concerned. If not, you shouldn’t be concerned.”
Larson asked why there is a financial penalty in the bill, saying the premise of the bill appears to  be that law enforcement must cooperate “or we’re cutting your damn funding.” 
“If they’re not cooperating with ICE and are not doing what they’re supposed to do to keep their community safe, there should be a penalty and the penalty should be felt,” Bradley said. 
“Do you think the sheriff’s department will be able to keep communities safe by cutting them?” Larson asked. 
“If they follow the guidance in the bill, they won’t have to worry about that,” Bradley said.

(Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Gov. Mike Braun warned  that Indiana needs swift solutions for its bevy of water and energy “challenges” to support the state’s expanding manufacturing sector.
The Republican governor gave candid remarks at a fireside chat at the 2025 Indianapolis Investment Forum held Tuesday at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
He touted Indiana as “the biggest manufacturing state in the country” and hoped for the Hoosier State “to be on the leading edge of the new base load.” Currently, though, “we clearly don’t have enough electricity.” 
“Right now, (Indiana has) all kinds of opportunities that straddle AI and technology. We’ve got the biggest two issues, probably in the state, that have come out of nowhere — the availability of water and electricity,” Braun said. “Neither one of those was on the horizon. But if you’re going to tap into that new technology, you’ve got to have it.”
Utilities based in Indiana currently produce just 20 gigawatts of electricity, Braun emphasized. A single data center could consume 5% of that total capacity.
Data centers are choosing Indiana. Is the state’s electricity supply ready?

Indiana is already home to more than four dozen data centers — powerhouses for the AI boom. Citizens Action Coalition, a utility-focused customer advocacy group, has tracked nearly 30 more energy-demanding facilities that have been proposed across the state.
Part of the issue, Braun said, “is we’re shutting down our coal fleet prematurely.” Had Indiana “known” earlier that an influx of data centers and other development would create such an energy demand, “then we wouldn’t be in the pickle we’re in now — because we were so dependent on (coal).”
“If you don’t keep up with it, you’re going to pay even more for it,” Braun continued, referring to energy generation. “You’ve got to get a little bit out of your comfort zone.”
An ongoing, statewide push seeks to attract various high-tech industries to Indiana. Braun said data centers, in particular, “want to come here because we’re at least one of the 15 states blessed with some water.” Even so, it’s a resource that Indiana “doesn’t have in abundance.”
The governor said Indiana’s energy future “will probably be small modular reactors,” or SMRs. State lawmakers, with Braun’s support, already adopted new nuclear energy incentives during the 2025 session.
“I see an unbelievable opportunity, if again, we can set the stage,” Braun said about SMR technology, although nuclear developments are likely still a decade away. “I hope to be the first guy. We’re leading a consortium of them to get out on the leading edge.”
And with more manufacturing comes a need for even more STEM-trained workers, Braun added. 
The governor said he’ll largely judge his administration’s achievements by its economic development gains — particularly around workforce development, skills training and attracting young talent for careers in emerging technologies. 
“Are we getting more of our own kids to come back to Indiana, to raise a family, and start a business?” Braun asked. “If we can measure that, and do it well … we would call it a real success.”

The list of Trump administration cuts to vital public services has become so long and destructive that it’s easy to get overwhelmed, but as North Carolina anti-poverty advocates continue to remind us, it’s important to hold the cuts up to the light, to document their cruel illogic.
Take, for instance, the disastrous scheme to eliminate the AmeriCorps program. As the North Carolina Housing Coalition reported last week, it’s suing over the planned elimination of this program that will cause thousands of dedicated young people and seniors to be summarily fired.
Here in North Carolina, AmeriCorps members and AmeriCorps Senior volunteers serve at more than 700 locations across the state, including schools, food banks, homeless shelters, health clinics, veterans’ facilities, and other nonprofit and faith-based organizations.
The bottom line: The Trump administration is gutting scores of vital programs like this, all so that it can dispense more big tax cuts that chiefly benefit the top one percent. And the cruel shortsightedness of it all is hard to overstate.

(Photo: Federal Emergency Management Agency)Under proposed new federal disaster aid thresholds designed to reduce the amount of funding distributed to states following natural disasters, Tennessee would have lost 37% of the assistance it received after disasters from 2008 to 2024, according to research from Urban Institute.
A memo sent from former Federal Emergency Management Agency acting administrator Cameron Hamilton to the White House Office of Management and Budget suggested quadrupling the damage threshold for federal aid, CNN reported in late April.
Nonprofit think tank Urban Institute analyzed 870 major disaster declarations that received public assistance grants from 2008 to 2024 using the proposed quadrupled threshold to “understand what these proposed changes could mean for federal disaster spending and state and local government budgets,” their report states.
President Donald Trump’s administration has repeatedly expressed its aims to cut FEMA spending and shift more post-disaster recovery responsibility to states, though it’s not clear if this higher threshold proposal will be implemented. Members of Congress continue to debate how FEMA should be reformed.
At a House Appropriations Committee hearing on May 7, Hamilton said federal law is clear on the federal government’s role as a resource for overwhelmed states.

“The problem is we’ve created financial incentives for the continuation of that, and even expanded levels,” Hamilton said. “We’ve kind of lowered disaster thresholds. We’ve used other criteria that, to be honest, are a little bit too soft for my opinion, that have incentivized financially a lack of carrying insurance policies, as well as lower disaster thresholds, which are probably not the best use of my staff.” Hamilton said. 
“This isn’t to say that states aren’t in need. We know they are, but we have to raise the threshold so that FEMA can truly prioritize efforts where the state is, in fact, overwhelmed, he said”
Hamilton, who was appointed by Trump, was fired from his interim role one day after the hearing, where he contradicted Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem by telling members of Congress that he believed eliminating FEMA entirely was “not in the best interest of the American people.” 
After a disaster, states assess damage and can request a presidential disaster declaration to open eligibility for aid through FEMA’s Disaster Relief Fund. The president has sole discretion over whether to approve a declaration, but FEMA uses internal thresholds to shape their recommendations to the president.
The minimum threshold for public assistance programs — which help state and local governments recoup the costs of debris clearing and infrastructure repairs — sits at a statewide cost-to-population ratio of $1.89 per capita impact (PCI). Quadrupling it would raise it to $7.56 PCI.
West Tennessee picks up pieces, awaits FEMA decision after severe storms

The nonprofit research group quadrupled the PCI threshold for each year between 2008 and 2024 and compared the costs from preliminary damage assessment reports for each disaster in that timeframe to determine if it would have met the threshold for federal aid. 
The group found that 71% of major disasters from 2008 to 2024 would not have received a presidential disaster declaration under the higher threshold, meaning states would have lost out on roughly $15 billion in federal assistance.
Tennessee would have lost $468 million of aid if this higher threshold had been in place, the report states.
The Hamilton memo also recommended reducing the federal government’s share of recovery costs when disaster declarations are granted by capping the share at 75%. 
Currently, the federal government covers at least 75% of costs. In Tennessee, the state and local governments typically split the remaining 25% share.
If the 75% cap had been in place from 2008 to 2024, Tennessee would have had to cover an additional $118 million in recovery costs — the most of any state or territory, according to the report.

Motte’s story was the focus of the South Carolina American Revolution Sestercentennial Commission’s inaugural Founding Mothers event. Members of the commission, which goes by SC250 for short, hope to create an annual tradition of recognizing the women who contributed to America’s founding as the country enters its 250th year.
Luther and Doraine Wannamaker, who own the property about 40 miles south of Columbia that once included the Motte home, offered to host the first Founding Mothers event on the anniversary of the day the British surrendered the fort. That just so happened to be the day after Mother’s Day.
Gov. Henry McMaster proclaimed Monday to be Founding Mothers’ Day.
Commissioners are aiming higher: They want state law changed to designate Founding Mothers’ Day as the Monday after Mother’s Day every year.
They have the backing of at least one legislator, Sen. Jeff Zell, a Sumter Republican who said Monday he’d be interested in sponsoring a resolution when legislators return to Columbia next year.
Putting the day in state law would be a permanent recognition of the role women played in the Revolution, a role that often gets overlooked, said retired Gen. Will Grimsley, chairman of the SC250 commission.
“We need to constantly go back and tell everybody’s story,” Grimsley said. “But a really undertold part of the story, quite frankly, are women.”

The Wannamakers have done reenactments of the siege, with men on horses riding from what would have been Fort Motte to the farmhouse where Motte herself had been exiled to tell her their plan of laying siege to her home, said Doraine Wannamaker.
The family hosts private tours of the spot, showing off the stone marker surrounded by dirt where the house once stood. An archaeologist from the University of South Carolina has visited repeatedly to dig up artifacts, including a cannonball and shot used by the British and Patriots.
But Monday was the first official event the Wannamakers have hosted alongside the commission responsible for highlighting South Carolina’s role in the Revolutionary War.
The story of Fort Motte
By the time British troops reached Motte’s home in what is now Calhoun County, on a bluff that overlooks what is now Congaree National Park, she had already been forced out of one home because of the war.
Motte’s original home in Charleston was selected as a headquarters for Loyalist lieutenant colonels and their company of 30 soldiers when British troops captured the coastal city. Motte, widowed not long before, fled inland to the property once owned by her brother, who had died several years earlier, according to the American Battlefield Trust.
Only a couple of months after Motte moved into the house, the British again came for her home. The house, located near the Congaree and Wateree rivers, was an ideal location for supplies coming from Charleston and headed to Camden and Ninety-Six, said Pickett, who has researched women’s contributions to the war effort.

In January 1781, British troops, led by Lt. Donald McPherson, took over the house, called it Fort Motte and surrounded it with fortifications. Motte and her three children fled to a nearby farmhouse on the property, according to the American Battlefield Trust.
Patriots took interest in Fort Motte in May of that year, after taking out several other British posts.
Forcing the British to surrender Motte’s house would take out a crucial supply line for the British.
As the Patriots, led by Brig. Gen. Francis Marion — known as the “Swamp Fox” — began the siege on Fort Motte, McPherson refused to surrender, correctly guessing reinforcements were approaching, Pickett said.
It was then that Motte, approached by either Marion or Lt. Colonel Henry Lee, agreed to let the Patriots burn down her house and destroy the supply depot altogether. According to some historical accounts, Motte gave the Americans combustible arrows to help them.
“Instead of being upset when told, she replied, according to Lee’s memoirs, that she was grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the good of her country, and she would watch the approaching scene with delight,” Pickett said.
After setting fire to the house’s roof, the Patriots fired grapeshot at any British soldiers who tried to put it out. McPherson surrendered, and the Patriots took back the burned Fort Motte. Patriots and British soldiers then dined together in the farmhouse where Motte and her family had been staying, Pickett said.
“Now, the capture of Fort Motte was not a grand, epic battle,” Pickett said. “It was a small, relatively bloodless engagement, but it was a significant victory for the Americans because it changed the momentum of the war in their favor.”
Not much remains of the site of the siege. A large stone that shows where the house once stood reads, “Site of Rebecca Motte’s home, sacrificed for her country, May 12, 1781.” As historians told the story of the battle, flags waved in blustery wind behind them, one British and several representing the Patriots, including the Gadsden flag.

Women during the war
Most women’s contributions to the war were small but meaningful. They managed farms and plantations while their husbands and sons were fighting in the war, sent food and provisions to the army and gathered information to pass along. They took sick and wounded soldiers into their homes and either nursed them back to health or buried them when they died, Pickett said.
“None of these things were very easy for them to do,” Pickett said.
Others had more active roles in thwarting British troops and helping the Patriots claim victory.
Take, for instance, Dorothy Sinkler Richardson, who historians credit with saving Marion’s life in 1780.
When British Col. Banastre Tarleton set up a decoy campsite near Richardson’s plantation meant to lure Marion for an attack, Richardson sent a messenger to warn Marion, according to SC250.
“Thanks to Dorothy Sinkler Richardson, Francis Marion remained at liberty to continue to make life difficult for the British,” Pickett said.
Jane Thomas, who lived in what is now Spartanburg, similarly foiled a plot to surprise American troops after overhearing two women talking about a plot to surprise Patriot soldiers near Thomas’ house. Thomas, who was 60 miles from home, rode back straight away to warn the men, allowing them to instead surprise the British troops, Pickett said.

Emily Geiger, at 18 years old, volunteered to deliver a message to Gen. Thomas Sumter (“The Gamecock”) to meet Maj. Gen. Nathanael Greene, believing a young woman would be able to get through enemy lines where a man would not. She was successful and helped join the two battalions, Pickett said.
In coming years, the commission plans to host similar events in other parts of the state, highlighting the stories of different women, said Molly Fortune, executive director of SC250.
Telling these stories is a major step forward, but there’s more work to be done, Pickett said.
Designating a day to remember the ways in which women contributed to the country’s foundation is a way of ensuring their stories remain in the public eye instead of being lost to history, she said.
“We are just beginning to explore the activities performed by Native American women and women of African descent,” Pickett said. “We need to do the research to bring their stories to light, because the more stories we bring to light, the more attention we bring to the important role that South Carolina played in winning our independence.”

Shielding kids from so-called “sexually explicit” materials. Ensuring our children’s education is aligned with values that uphold morality. Permitting chaplains to fill the gaps for mental health support at our public schools. 
Let’s think about the children, they said. Let’s protect the children! 
But good intentions don’t always equate to good legislation, as we saw during the 2025 legislative session with bill after bill that pushed ideological principles, imposed Christian doctrines and would have done little more than chip away at our First Amendment rights. 
Since the First Amendment was ratified in 1791 as part of the Bill of Rights, these 45 words have been integral to democracy. It protects our fundamental rights to free expression and speech, to practice religion or no religion at all, and to protest our government, among other rights.
Upholding these rights is the sworn responsibility of our elected leaders. But the culture warriors among our state legislative assembly seemed wholly unconcerned. And that’s extremely alarming!
Take Senate Bill 2307, for example. Legislators narrowly passed this bill that sparked contentious debate in committee hearings and on the legislative floor, with much of the discussion focused on fears that children might discover library books featuring teenagers in same-sex relationships or depicting families with two dads or two moms. 
If community members don’t want to engage with certain ideas or topics – or let their kids engage with certain ideas or topics – they don’t have to. Substituting state control for parental judgement is not the answer. In fact, that’s censorship. And once you allow the government to censor someone else, you’re also giving the government the power to censor you or something you like later. 
Similarly, religious freedom was up for debate this year, too. 
Not long ago, religious freedom was largely viewed across the ideological and political spectrum as a bedrock value of American democracy that transcended partisan agendas. Every individual and family — not politicians or the government — get to decide for themselves what religious beliefs, if any, they adopt and practice. But in statehouses across the county, religious freedom debates are now at the epicenter of the culture wars as some believe certain Christian ideals should be reflected in political decisions. 
North Dakota lawmakers attempted to require public schools to post prescribed copies of the Ten Commandments in public school and university classrooms and other school spaces with House Bill 1145 and they wanted to encourage local school districts to allow taxpayer-funded chaplains in our public schools with House Bill 1456.
As enshrined in the First Amendment, however, religious freedom includes two complementary protections: the right to religious belief and expression and a guarantee that the government neither prefers religion over non-religion nor favors particular faiths over others. These dual protections are supposed to work hand in hand, allowing religious liberty to thrive and safeguarding both religion and government from the influences of the other.
The ACLU’s opposition to these bills doesn’t mean we don’t believe protecting children or ensuring their education is guided by strong moral values isn’t important. It’s just that parents already have the right and ability to do so. And what’s right for one family may not be right for another. That’s not up for someone else to decide. 
Fortunately, Gov. Kelly Armstrong vetoed Senate Bill 2307, and an attempt to override the veto failed. House Bills 1145 and 1456 failed, too. Protecting our First Amendment rights like this is essential for a vibrant and open society where individuals can express themselves freely, hold the government accountable and participate in the democratic process. 
But just because the 2025 legislative session is over doesn’t mean the fight for our First Amendment rights in North Dakota is over. Far from it. The state legislature isn’t the only place these debates are happening. We’re seeing similar efforts at local community library boards, school boards and city councils across the state, too. You can bet the culture warriors among our legislative body will try again during the 2027 session, too. 
We know that attacks on our First Amendment rights won’t stop – and the American Civil Liberties Union of North Dakota is prepared to continue the fight.",https://northdakotamonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/gettyimages-925364372-1024x6841741732180-1.jpg,,,2025-05-14 07:04:47.478702

Natural gas customers in the Chicago suburbs and downstate Illinois are likely to see an increase in their monthly bills next year, but it's up to state regulators to decide how big a hike, if any, to approve.

Nicor Gas, which serves 2.3 million customers in northern and western Illinois, requested the largest gas rate plan in state history — roughly equivalent to $7.50 per month for the average residential customer. Ameren Illinois, which has about 800,000 downstate customers, requested an increase that translates to between $8 to $10 higher monthly bills for a typical residential customer.

Regulators at the Illinois Commerce Commission are expected to announce a decision as to whether to approve or alter the hikes in November. The new rates would go into effect at the start of 2026.

In the meantime, consumer watchdogs and environmental advocates are railing against both utilities for their requests, which they argue should be slashed drastically.

Critiques from consumer groups

The Citizens Utility Board, a consumer watchdog group, filed written testimony this month in both cases arguing that the requests should be cut — Nicor's by about 36% and Ameren's by about 42%. Other groups, like the Illinois attorney general’s office, the Environmental Defense Fund and others argued for additional cuts in their own filings.

Abe Scarr, director of the consumer advocacy group Illinois PIRG, said the companies are requesting “long-term commitments” in paying for gas system infrastructure, despite the potential for decreasing demand for fossil fuels.

“The more expensive their infrastructure investments, the more opportunity they have to profit,” Scarr said.

Because utility profits are regulated by agencies like the ICC, there is a financial incentive to invest in infrastructure so that more funds can be “recovered” from customers — a portion of which then go to shareholders.

That rate of return is one of the things being litigated in these rate cases. Both companies requested a bump in their allowed “return on equity,” which translates to the amount paid to shareholders. In recent years, the ICC has consistently rejected utilities’ requests for higher return rates, although they have approved some modest increases.

“You’re asking us to predict what those shares are worth next year? Next month is gonna be hard,” CUB’s general counsel Eric DeBellis said.

DeBellis said the companies overstepped in other areas of their requests as well, including costs associated with rate cases and post-employment benefits as well as an accounting irregularity worth millions of dollars that Ameren has already admitted was erroneous.

He noted that Nicor included tens of millions of dollars of projects that were rejected by the ICC in the company’s rate request two years ago, a move that DeBellis called “galling.”

Environmentalists question future of gas

The companies drew criticism from some environmentalists, who argued in testimony this month that investing in natural gas infrastructure as the state — and country — move away from fossil fuels could leave customers on the hook for the bill for decades.

Curt Stokes, a senior attorney at the Environmental Defense Fund, said he's concerned that gas companies are building out new gas infrastructure in a way that “locks us in and keeps us hooked on fossil fuels for our energy needs.”

For Ameren, much of the contention comes from the company’s plan to upgrade its natural gas system, a plan that company officials say is required by federal safety rules. But critics point out that Ameren frequently chooses to totally replace pipes — the most expensive and most profitable option — instead of cheaper alternatives like testing them for safety.

But Ameren officials defend the choice as being the only option to ensure compliance with federal rules.

“The investments we have proposed in our reliability plan will enable us to meet strict federal pipeline safety requirements, reduce leaks, and provide reliable and affordable natural gas service for our residential and business customers,” Brad Kloeppel, Ameren’s senior director of gas operations, said in a statement. “We evaluate all methods available for each segment of pipe subject to compliance based on cost and operational feasibility.""

Meanwhile, advocates have criticized Nicor’s efforts at lessening greenhouse gas emissions.

The utility requested to make permanent a pilot program called “TotalGreen,” a voluntary effort that allows customers to pay to offset their carbon footprint through a mix of “renewable natural gas” and investments in methane capture and forest conservation.

“They certainly have not demonstrated, and there’s lots of — lots of — reasons to be skeptical, that there’s any environmental benefit,” Scarr said.

The EDF, Illinois PIRG and the Environmental Law and Policy Center argued in a joint filing that the “TotalGreen” program fails to live up to the state’s clean energy goals.

Among other reasons, the groups’ testimony said it costs more than $2,400 per person and has only offset the equivalent of 0.0031% of the company’s yearly carbon footprint.

Jennifer Golz, a Nicor spokesperson, said the program “supports the state’s broader environmental objectives on the path to a sustainable future.”

“Nicor Gas supports our parent company, Southern Company Gas, in its goal to achieve net zero direct greenhouse gas emissions from its operations by 2050,” Golz said in an email. “We also support reducing emissions across the natural gas value chain, from gas production to transmission to end uses.”

TotalGreen is one of several projects outlined in the two rate cases which use “renewable natural gas,” a term for methane that is captured from landfills, wastewater treatment plants and farms that would have otherwise been released into the atmosphere.

Stokes said there were “too many open questions” about renewable natural gas programs for the EDF to support the initiatives, but he was optimistic about some of the companies’ other proposals.

“There are good signs in these cases that Nicor and Ameren are looking to be more innovative,” Stokes said.

He pointed specifically to Nicor’s energy efficiency programs and a proposal for a pilot program at Ameren which would allow communities to transition from natural gas to electric all at once as pipes need to be replaced or retired.

Jared Polis signed the Colorado Voting Rights Act, a measure Gonzales sponsored, into law Monday, May 12, 2025 at the Governor’s Residence in Denver. (Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)Colorado legislators this year passed a handful of bills related to elections and democracy.
One of the bills put existing federal rights into state law in case national protections erode. Another changed how the state fills vacant General Assembly seats, which became a hot topic after three senators resigned in the period after last November’s election and the start of the legislative session.
The session, during which Democrats held large majorities in both the House of Representatives and Senate, ended last week. Here is a look at some of the key elections and democracy proposals lawmakers adopted.
The right to vote
Gov. Jared Polis signed the Colorado Voting Rights Act, Senate Bill 25-1, into law earlier this week. The law codifies parts of the 1965 national voting rights law into state statute in case federal protections are stripped, either at the hands of the Trump administration or through the courts.
The law clarifies the right to vote across racial and language minority groups and adds ballot translation requirements to municipal elections. A handful of cities in the state opposed the bill because of increased workload and cost. The law also bans voting qualifications based on sexual orientation, gender expression or whether a voter is in jail.
It also creates a civil right for voters to bring discrimination lawsuits against local governments for alleged voter suppression.
“Colorado’s election system is one of the very best in the country, and with this, we’re taking steps to make sure that no matter what happens at the federal level, we can make sure to protect our voter integrity here in the great state of Colorado,” Polis said before signing the bill into law.
The bill passed with entirely Democratic support.
Gun ban
Polis signed House Bill 25-1225 the same day as the Colorado Voting Rights Act. The law prohibits someone from carrying a visible gun or toy gun while doing certain election-related activities such as voting, canvassing, counting votes and helping someone else vote. Carrying a visible gun during those activities will be classified as voter intimidation.
“Those who serve as on a canvas board or serve as election judges — these are salt-of-the-Earth, dedicated positions. They require an incredible amount of time,” bill sponsor Sen. Nick Hinrichsen, a Pueblo Democrat, said ahead of the bill’s signing. “When they come under threat for the work they do to preserve the freedom of our communities, our state and our country, we need to ensure that they have protections on the back end. That’s what this bill does.”
Lawmaker vacancy process
A bipartisan bill changed how vacancies in the General Assembly are filled when a lawmaker resigns or dies before the end of their term. There were five vacancy selections this year. They concerned three Senate seats, a House seat when a representative moved to one of the vacant Senate seats, and another Senate seat when a lawmaker resigned amid an ethics investigation.
Right now, a vacancy committee comprising members of the outgoing lawmaker’s party, often highly-involved party insiders, picks a replacement to serve until the next general election. That could create a scenario where a handful of people pick a legislator to serve the entirety of a term if a lawmaker resigns shortly after reelection.










This bill makes sure that somebody will represent the people of a district, but as soon as they have the opportunity to stand (for an election), then people can run against them. That's fair.


– Gov. Jared Polis


The new process creates a new vacancy election to coincide with an already-scheduled election. Vacancy committees would still immediately fill the seat, but the appointed lawmaker would then need to run to retain their seat, either that same year or the next one, depending on when the resignation happened.
The idea is that an appointed lawmaker could serve in just one session before running for reelection.
The law also increases the number of people who serve on a vacancy committee by including more precinct organizers and county commissioners of the same party that live in the district.
“This bill makes sure that somebody will represent the people of a district, but as soon as they have the opportunity to stand (for an election), then people can run against them. That’s fair. I think it strikes a good balance, and it will make sure that we have more accountability to the people of our great state,” Polis said before signing the bill on May 12.
Ballot initiative standards
House Bill 25-1327 would make changes to the citizen initiative process, in which people can bring measures to the ballot if they gather enough signatures.
“With more and more ballot initiatives being brought, we are trying to make the process easier for people to track and follow, and we are also trying to reduce some inefficiencies for agencies that are part of the title review process,” bill sponsor Sen. Cathy Kipp, a Fort Collins Democrat, said during the bill’s Senate committee hearing.
If initiative proponents bring five or more drafts in the same cycle on the same topic, they would need to submit a chart explaining the differences between the drafts so the state’s Title Board and other interested parties can understand the distinctions between the versions.
Proponents for initiatives who earn a title, which allows them to collect signatures, would need to update the secretary of state when they reach 25%, 50% and 75% of their required petition signatures, and those statuses would also get posted online.
Fiscal summaries for initiatives that propose a tax increase would need to include an estimate of the maximum revenue change.
Additionally, the Title Board would be required to indicate whether an initiative would modify, extend or repeal existing law or create new law.
There are also some calendar and deadline changes for the Title Board in the bill.
The bill passed on party-line votes in both chambers, with Democrats in favor. Polis has not yet taken action on it.

House Bill 436, sponsored by Rep. Gabe Firment, R-Pollock, cleared the Senate Committee on Judiciary A in a 4-3 vote along party lines Tuesday with Republicans prevailing. The measure heads to the floor for final passage. 
“I can’t wait to read the bad press,” committee chairman Sen. Greg Miller, R-Norco, said shortly after the committee adjourned.
Firment’s bill would prohibit “unauthorized aliens” — defined in the measure as individuals illegally in the United States under federal immigration law — from receiving insurance payouts for general damages in auto accidents. General damages include compensation for pain and suffering. The proposal would still allow recovery for “special damages,” such as medical expenses and property damage.
Firment said the purpose of his bill is to help address the state’s auto insurance crisis while discouraging undocumented immigration. 
Sen. Sam Jenkins, D-Shreveport, said Firment’s bill would create a “double standard” by allowing insurance companies to profit off migrants without legal status while not facing much risk. Insurers would still be able to sell coverage to noncitizens but would not have to cover their damages in certain situations, he said.
Louisiana auto insurance proposals include limits on ‘unauthorized alien’ lawsuits

Sen. Jay Luneau, D-Alexandria, argued that same point.
“Insurance companies do sell insurance to illegal aliens,” Luneau said. “… As long as they have a passport, they will sell them insurance, including uninsured motorist [coverage]. So under your bill, they would not be able to collect for the bodily injury portion of that claim, so they’re buying an insurance policy that they can’t collect on.”
Firment said his bill would not stop insurers from voluntarily paying or settling a bodily injury claim for an undocumented immigrant. 
He also mentioned a commercial trucking company owner who recently laid off five drivers due to the high cost of auto insurance in Louisiana.  
“If there’s anything I can do to help those folks, that’s what I’m here for,” Firment said.

Firment said the purpose of his bill is to help address the state’s auto insurance crisis while discouraging undocumented immigration. 
Sen. Sam Jenkins, D-Shreveport, said Firment’s bill would create a “double standard” by allowing insurance companies to profit off migrants without legal status while not facing much risk. Insurers would still be able to sell coverage to noncitizens but would not have to cover their damages in certain situations, he said.
Louisiana auto insurance proposals include limits on ‘unauthorized alien’ lawsuits

Sen. Jay Luneau, D-Alexandria, argued that same point.
“Insurance companies do sell insurance to illegal aliens,” Luneau said. “… As long as they have a passport, they will sell them insurance, including uninsured motorist [coverage]. So under your bill, they would not be able to collect for the bodily injury portion of that claim, so they’re buying an insurance policy that they can’t collect on.”
Firment said his bill would not stop insurers from voluntarily paying or settling a bodily injury claim for an undocumented immigrant. 
He also mentioned a commercial trucking company owner who recently laid off five drivers due to the high cost of auto insurance in Louisiana.  
“If there’s anything I can do to help those folks, that’s what I’m here for,” Firment said.

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)A $6.96 million settlement — the second largest in Milwaukee’s history — stems from a federal civil lawsuit which accused Milwaukee Police Department (MPD) detectives of fabricating evidence against Danny Wilber, framing him for a 2004 homicide. Wilber spent 18 years in prison for a crime he always asserted he didn’t commit. 
Wilber’s homicide conviction was ultimately overturned after he was found to have had an unfair trial in a federal appeals court. On May 8, the city’s Judiciary and Legislation Committee recommended approving the settlement. Yet before it was approved, elected leaders expressed discontent that taxpayers in Milwaukee would be footing the bill. 
Further approvals will be needed from the Common Council and Mayor Cavalier Johnson. In a statement, Wilber said that the settlement “clearly establishes what I have truthfully maintained at all times — that I was completely innocent and that it was physically impossible that I committed this murder.” 
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
Ald. Mark Chambers Jr. called the judge in Wilber’s case “incompetent”, while Ald. Robert Bauman said the judge made “some pretty bad decisions,” the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. Council President Jose Perez said the city was “paying the price for some bad judgement and it’s inexcusable.” Yet it was city of Milwaukee police detectives, not a judge, who manipulated evidence in the case, and laid the groundwork for the settlement nearly 20 years after they arrested Wilber. 
In January 2004, Wilber was at an after-hours party when, according to a federal complaint, he got into an argument with another party guest. As more people got involved the argument became a physical altercation which was being watched by another guest, David Diaz. At some point during the fight, someone standing behind Diaz shot him in the back of the head at close range. Diaz died instantly, and everyone who’d been in the kitchen panicked and left. 
The complaint states that physical evidence from the scene showed that Diaz had been shot from behind. One of the named defendants in the civil action, Milwaukee police detective Thomas Casper, collected measurements from the scene and recovered bullet fragments that showed that Diaz had been shot from behind. Diaz’s autopsy corroborated those findings. “It was and is undisputed that, at the time of the shooting, Plaintiff Wilber was inside the kitchen and in front of David Diaz,” the complaint reads. 
Despite the ballistic evidence, MPD detectives honed in on Diaz as the main murder suspect. Detectives didn’t look into multiple other plausible suspects, and went as far as to fabricate witness statements, the complaint states. Two other detectives, Randolph Olson and Louis Johnson, interrogated a witness to the shooting, Richard Torres, who was wanted for probation violations and turned himself in for questioning. Olson and Johnson used “threats and intimidation” to compel Torres to give a false statement by threatening to charge him with murder, and making clear that they were interested in Wilber as the shooter. Around the same time, another detective, Gregory Schuler, interrogated another witness, Jeranek Diaz. The complaint accuses Schuler of fabricating “substantial parts of a statement” from Diaz, including that at the time of the shooting, David Diaz had just turned around and was about to leave the kitchen when he was shot. Jeranek Diaz never said those statements, and was not allowed to review the typewritten version of his statement. Notes that Schuler allegedly took during the interview were never presented either to the prosecution or to Wilber’s attorneys. 
Other detectives interviewed witnesses who had a learning disability and said after the shooting that she saw her brother pat himself down to check if he’d been shot. The detectives, Timothy Duffy and Joseph Erwin, wrote that the witness ducked her head and when she looked back up, everyone was running out the door and she hadn’t seen her brother. Duffy and Erwin did not read the witness’s statement back to her, and she signed the statement without knowing what it said. 
One witness who was detained overnight without food, water or access to showers was told after interviews by detectives that he was “not telling us what we need to hear”, before being returned to a cell. Eventually, the exhausted witnesses agreed to make false statements if he was allowed to go home. Detectives also manipulated scene diagrams, and Wilber was charged with first-degree intentional homicide with a dangerous weapon in February 2004. Prosecutors heavily relied on evidence compiled by detectives, as well as false witness statements.

Wilber spent 18 years in prison, with the Milwaukee County District Attorney’s Office formally dismissing his case in May 2022. In order to carry out what the complaint describes as a “conspiracy,” the detectives would have needed to act alongside other MPD investigative, supervisory and command personnel, as well as “other unknown co-conspirators.” Casper would eventually go on to become one of the first commanders for the Milwaukee Area Investigative Team (MAIT), a network of detectives that focuses on civilian deaths by police, and which has been criticized for conducting problematic death reviews. MAIT selected a different commander in 2020, and Casper died by the time Wilber’s lawsuit reached its conclusion.
“The evidence that came out in this case showed that this was not a series of mistakes by a squad of incompetent detectives,” Wilber said in a statement. “No, it was a conscious plan to construct a false case against me with manufactured witness statements in order to put me behind bars. It was a plan that they have used again and again against Black, Indigenous and other poor people of color. In this case, like in many others, the prosecutors and the Court system were, from beginning to end, vindictively complicit in my wrongful conviction and incarceration. This settlement delivers a measure of justice against the police who framed me, but what about the prosecutor who presented the false evidence at trial? What about the Judge who allowed it and violated my constitutional rights? What about the Assistant Attorney General who fought for years to keep me in a cage after my conviction was overturned and took the case all the way up to the Supreme Court of the United States? They’re all complicit and because of the corrupt system, they get to walk away, free to repeat the egregious misconduct under the guise of due processes.”
Attorneys Ben Elson and Flint Taylor of the People’s Law Office in Chicago, who represented Wilber, said that the city would be paying him nearly $7 million because its detectives framed an innocent man. The attorneys addressed statements made by local elected officials, who were quick to blame the judge and other non-city government figures in the case. “Instead of passing the blame onto others, the City should publicly acknowledge its role in Danny Wilber’s wrongful conviction and make a sincere apology.”

Tennessee Lookout)I’m a Tennessean, a mother of three, and someone who lives with a complex, disabling pain condition. 
I’m also the CEO of a national nonprofit dedicated to improving the lives of the more than 51.6 million Americans who live with chronic pain. And right now, I’m deeply alarmed by Tennessee legislation that could strip away access to the thing that helps me — and thousands of others — get through the day: safe, full-spectrum CBD.
House Bill 1376 and Senate Bill 1413 would limit even trace amounts of Delta-9 THC in hemp-derived products — effectively banning many full-spectrum CBD products that are non-intoxicating, carefully formulated, and third-party tested. While I support common-sense regulation to eliminate unsafe synthetic intoxicants and unregulated products from the market, this bill goes too far. Rather than protecting consumers, it threatens to harm more than 665,000 Tennesseans who rely on full-spectrum hemp CBD for relief.
For people living with chronic pain, full-spectrum CBD is not a luxury — it’s a lifeline. I’ve lived with pain for over 30 years due to a rare, chronic pain condition that causes widespread, burning nerve pain. The simplest tasks — standing, lifting my child, working a full day — can be nearly impossible without some form of relief. I’ve tried dozens of treatments, from prescription medications to physical therapy to surgical interventions. Some helped. Many didn’t. Full-spectrum CBD is one of the few things that consistently makes a difference. It reduces inflammation, soothes muscle spasms, and takes the edge off my daily suffering.
Every day, I use three specific full-spectrum products — a tincture, a topical, and an edible. They contain trace amounts of naturally occurring Delta-9 THC, well within the federal legal limit of 0.3%. These products don’t get me high. They help me sleep. They help me show up for my job and be present for my family. They allow me to contribute to my community and care for my kids. Without them, I don’t know how I would manage.
Hemp bill conflict could fire up House, Senate finance committees

And I am not alone.
At the U.S. Pain Foundation, we regularly hear from individuals who face serious challenges in accessing the care and relief they need to manage chronic pain. Barriers like stigma, high costs, limited treatment options and restrictive policies often stand in the way. For some, hemp-derived CBD has become an essential part of their pain management plan, helping them live with greater dignity and less suffering. In fact, a national survey we conducted in 2022 found that 22% of respondents currently use hemp-derived CBD products — often alongside other therapies as part of a multidisciplinary approach to care. These individuals deserve access to the treatments that help them, free from unnecessary barriers.
Science is catching up, too. Studies show CBD as a promising option for managing chronic pain, particularly neuropathic and inflammatory pain, due to its comprehensive therapeutic approach. Unlike isolated cannabinoids, full-spectrum CBD includes all naturally occurring compounds from the cannabis plant — such as a range of cannabinoids, terpenes, and flavonoids — which work together to produce what’s known as the ‘entourage effect.’ 
Recent research explores the potential benefits of various cannabinoids in pain management and emphasizes the role of synergistic interactions and the entourage effect, highlighting the importance of full-spectrum products in achieving optimal therapeutic outcomes.
And yet, despite this growing body of evidence, Tennessee lawmakers are poised to remove this option from people who need it most. HB 1376/SB 1413 fails to distinguish between therapeutic, non-intoxicating full-spectrum products and the synthetic or recreational products that rightly raise concern. In doing so, it threatens the health, independence, and stability of thousands of Tennesseans living with pain.
I was heartbroken to see the legislature pass this bill. But I still hold out hope — hope that rests now with Gov. Bill Lee. I’ve written to him personally, urging a veto. I ask my fellow Tennesseans — especially those who’ve never had to think twice about how they manage their pain—to consider what’s at stake.
This isn’t about special treatment or backdoor legalization. It’s about the right to access safe, plant-based wellness tools. It’s about evidence-based public policy that doesn’t punish people for trying to survive their conditions. It’s about understanding that one-size-fits-all health care solutions often leave the most vulnerable behind.
We are your neighbors, coworkers, veterans, and grandparents. We are Tennesseans who want to live productive lives despite our pain. Please don’t take away one of the few tools that helps us do that.
I hope Gov. Lee will veto HB 1376/SB 1413 and protect access to full-spectrum CBD. Preserve the dignity, autonomy, and well-being of people living with pain in Tennessee.

I was 43 when I received the simultaneously wonderful and intimidating news that I would be the mother of twins. Later, when it was confirmed that both boys would be born with Down syndrome, fear took the front seat. I had no idea how I would provide care for two children with disabilities. I had so many questions.
To my relief, I soon discovered that Idaho had several programs in place to support our family. First, there was the Katie Beckett waiver which gave our sons access to Medicaid coverage and spared us from what would have been crushing NICU bills.
Over the years, Medicaid has been the backbone of their health care — funding multiple surgeries, specialist appointments, and ongoing speech, occupational, and physical therapies. We’ve also benefited from waivers that help with alternative therapies, community support, personal care services, respite care and other services that have allowed our boys to be active participants in our community.
Children’s health services could see trims even under scaled-back Medicaid cuts

These supports haven’t just met our needs — they’ve helped shape our sons’ lives. They’ve made it possible for them to grow up healthy, engaged, and included.
I’ve spent years volunteering with the Treasure Valley Down Syndrome Association, where I’ve walked alongside many new parents as they try to make sense of this complex system. I have always been proud that Idaho is a state that invests in the unique and individualized needs of children with disabilities.
That’s why what’s happening now in Congress is so concerning.
Today, I’m scared — not for a diagnosis or a milestone, but because the services that have kept my children thriving for the past nine years are at risk. Medicaid and its optional programs — including the Katie Beckett waiver — are vulnerable to cuts, and proposed changes at the federal level threaten the very foundation of support many families depend on.
It’s important to understand how this system works. Medicaid currently allows states to partner with the federal government, funding essential services for individuals with disabilities. In Idaho, the federal government provides 70 cents of every dollar the state spends on Medicaid services to individuals with disabilities. This partnership helps provide life-changing support, but proposed cuts threaten this vital funding. If that funding is slashed or capped, families may be forced to go without the services their children need.
Medicaid isn’t just about health care — it also supports children with disabilities in public schools. My sons’ paraprofessionals, aides, special education teachers, adaptive equipment and educational aids are all made possible through Medicaid funding. If these resources disappear, schools will be left scrambling to meet the needs of some of their most vulnerable students — and many of Idaho’s schools, especially our rural schools won’t be able to.
And the need for services is only growing. The average life expectancy for people with Down syndrome has risen dramatically over the past few decades, now reaching into their 60s. With longer lives comes a greater need for long-term support — support that allows individuals to live in the community, hold jobs, maintain relationships, and enjoy lives of dignity, meaning and personal contributions.
My husband and I recently visited the site of the former Willowbrook State School in New York — a haunting reminder of what can happen when families don’t have the support they need. Willowbrook was an institution where people with developmental disabilities were warehoused, neglected, and abused. The facility closed in 1987, and today, the site is home to a college that promotes inclusion for individuals with disabilities and trains professionals in disability services. It’s a powerful symbol of change — and a warning.
We cannot forget the lessons of the past. When families are left without options, systems break down. Crisis care becomes the default. People are pushed to the margins. And the most vulnerable pay the highest price.
Our country has an opportunity to stay the course — to keep investing in programs that work, that save lives, and that allow families to stay together. But that will only happen if our leaders choose to protect and prioritize Medicaid.
To our elected officials in Washington: I urge you — do not turn your backs on families like mine. Preserve Medicaid and the absolutely vital services it provides. Maintain the many programs that give individuals with disabilities the chance to live full and meaningful lives.
Our country has an opportunity to stay the course — to keep investing in programs that work, that save lives, and that allow families to stay together. The decisions made in Washington will determine whether individuals with disabilities continue to receive the care they need and deserve. Medicaid has long been a cornerstone or that support. It is critical that our representatives understand just how much is at stake — for families, for communities, and for the future we are building together.

Chances are state lawmakers or religious zealots did not escort you inside, and you didn’t have to wonder whose stories were hidden behind locked doors or inside a vault because nothing was locked up.
By “whose stories,” I refer to those books that reflect the lives of readers who may not often be depicted in literature, much less in a positive manner. So, a Black child who can’t read about racial prejudice in Maya Angelou’s I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings might blame himself for his own race-based struggles in a white-dominated society. The child who was molested might blame himself until he reads another book often targeted by censors, Toni Morrison’s The Bluest Eye. Or teenagers questioning their own sexual identity might fear they’re the only ones with such a quandary until they read Maia Kobabe’s Gender Queer. Kobabe’s book was one of numerous books targeted by former state senator Jason Rapert of Conway during his tumultuous time on the Arkansas State Library Board.
Recently, the Arkansas Legislature chose to abolish that board, which wasn’t as censorship-prone as many lawmakers apparently wanted, and to have the governor appoint a new panel. As if that weren’t bad enough, the legislature later approved a bill requiring librarians in schools with kindergarten through fifth-grade students to “store non-age-appropriate sexual content … in a locked compartment within a designated area.” The bill defines “non-age-appropriate sexual content” as “any materials that include explicit instruction, promotion, or advocacy of sexual ideology, behaviors, or orientations that are not developmentally appropriate for kindergarten through grade five … students.” 
The law does not specify who decides what is age-appropriate.










Arkansas’ escalating campaign of censorship represents yet another vague, punitive, and politically motivated attempt to chill free expression and intimidate public servants.


– Megan Bailey, communications director, ACLU of Arkansas, referring to Act 917 of 2025


This escalation in the war against libraries and public school teachers came after a federal judge in December struck down challenged provisions of Act 372 of 2023 which sought to criminalize librarians who provided minors with access to inappropriate books. 
Part of Act 372 that went unchallenged in court and that became law “already requires school libraries to place books deemed to be inappropriate in an area inaccessible to students under 18,” said Deborah Caldwell-Stone, director of the American Library Association’s Office for Intellectual Freedom.
So, why was the lock-’em-up measure, Act 917 of 2025, even needed? Perhaps, for show, for politicians to look tough when it comes to already-denigrated librarians and teachers.
I asked Megan Bailey, communications director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas, about the possibility of the ACLU’s suing over Act 917.
“We are currently reviewing all options and are continuing to monitor how this and related laws are enforced,” Bailey replied.
Referring to “Arkansas’ escalating campaign of censorship,” Bailey said Act 917 “represents yet another vague, punitive, and politically motivated attempt to chill free expression and intimidate public servants.”
“While it may appear narrower than Act 372 on its face, the lack of clarity around what constitutes ‘developmentally appropriate’ content — and the threat of civil lawsuits against libraries and librarians — creates a chilling effect that will likely lead to over-removal of lawful, constitutionally protected materials out of fear of retribution,” Bailey said in an email.
Caldwell-Stone said in an email that, nationally, Act 917 “is unique in that it requires books that are deemed to include ‘advocacy of sexual ideology, behaviors, or orientations’ not developmentally appropriate for K-5 students to be kept under lock and key, requires parental permission to access such books, and includes provisions for punishing schools and educators who do not comply.”
“In targeting books that address or include themes about gender and sexual orientation, the law may be engaging in unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination under the First Amendment. Additionally, the parental permission requirement could also be found unconstitutional and a violation of students’ rights to access books in the school library,” Caldwell-Stone said.
She noted that in 2003, a federal court ruled against the Cedarville, Arkansas, School Board when the court “set aside a school board’s requirement that students submit a written parental permission slip to access the Harry Potter series.”
“It held having to obtain parental permission to check out the books from the school library constituted a restriction on access that violated the students’ First Amendment rights, given that the books had been restricted because school board members ‘dislike[d] the ideas contained in those books,’” Caldwell-Stone said.
“Laws that impose ambiguous standards and threaten punishment for subjective violations raise serious First Amendment concerns. Librarians should not have to face punishment for failing to implement vague, content-based restrictions,” she added. 
Despite court rulings and astute cautions, books and intellectual freedom have long been targets of the morality police, though I can’t remember a time when the far right targeted libraries in Arkansas as much as it has recently.
Censorship was, of course, a hallmark of the late 1940s-50s McCarthy era, and I trust — no, I only hope — that few politicians today yearn to be identified with an era that blacklisted artists and censored books. (Case in point: Ray Bradbury’s dystopian 1953 novel Fahrenheit 451, in which firefighters burn down any houses that contain outlawed books, was published  “for many years” only in a censored version, according to PEN America, a free-expression advocacy nonprofit.)
Lest you think the ACLU, the ALA and I are overreacting, note that in 1965 the novel Black Beauty was banned in South Africa during that country’s apartheid era because of the word “Black” in the title, according to PEN America.
In the United States, the first book in J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter series became the most often challenged book in libraries from 2000-2009, according to the American Library Association. And the U.S. Naval Academy, responding to President Donald Trump’s anti-diversity orders, removed nearly 400 volumes from its library this year. 
Where does the censorship stop? Should the Bible be banned because it features stories of polygamy, incest and horrific death? I say no. But if the censors are consistent, they will say yes.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/gettyimages-2148912235-1024x640.jpg,,,2025-05-14 06:00:52.660627

Local sheriffs are on the front lines in deciding whether to participate in the Trump administration’s mass deportation plans. But states increasingly are making the choice for them.
More and more, sheriffs’ hands are tied no matter whether they do — or don’t — want to help with deportations, though they often get the blame when conservatives draw up lists of sanctuary cities.
“‘Naughty lists,’ as we call them, are not super helpful here,” said Patrick Royal, a spokesperson for the National Sheriffs’ Association. “We all know there are places like Colorado where you can’t [help with deportations], and places like North Carolina where you have to.”
Cooperation between sheriffs and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement lies at the heart of the Trump administration’s immigration detention policy. The administration plans to punish noncooperative jurisdictions with funding cuts — though many legal experts agree that cooperation is voluntary unless state or local laws say otherwise.
Sheriffs, who typically run local jails, must decide what to do when faced with immigration detainers — requests from ICE to hold onto incarcerated people up to two extra days so ICE officers can show up and arrest them. ICE issues those detainers when the agency reviews fingerprints sent electronically for background checks as part of the jail booking process.
Otherwise, arrested suspects who post bond or are otherwise released by a judge might go free despite their immigration status, prompting ICE in some cases to pursue them in the community.
In North Carolina, Sheriff Garry McFadden ran on a platform of limiting cooperation with ICE  when he was elected in Mecklenburg County, home to Charlotte, in 2018. But today, McFadden must comply with detainers because of a state law passed last year.
In a now-retracted Facebook post, U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis in late April accused Mecklenburg and several other North Carolina counties of “shielding criminal illegal immigrants” as sanctuary jurisdictions. Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, said in the post he was writing federal legislation to prosecute sanctuary jurisdictions.
“You can’t say we’re a sanctuary county and have state laws that say we have to work with ICE. You can’t have both,” McFadden said. He added that he’d like more choice about whether to comply with detainers. A federal funding cutoff would endanger important jail programs such as rape counseling, he said.
“Everybody’s focused on immigration like that’s the biggest fire, and nobody wants to address the other things. The losers will be the prisoners who need all these services we provide,” McFadden said.










You can’t say we’re a sanctuary county and have state laws that say we have to work with ICE. You can’t have both. 


– Sheriff Garry McFadden, Mecklenburg County, N.C. 


Conservative sheriffs in Democratic-controlled states also can be frustrated by state policy on detainers. Sheriff Lew Evangelidis of Worcester County, Massachusetts, said he’s been criticized for releasing prisoners wanted by ICE but sometimes has no choice: A 2017 state Supreme Court ruling prohibits holding prisoners based on detainers.
“If they [ICE] want this person and consider them a threat to public safety, then I want that person out of my community. I want to keep my community safe,” said Evangelidis. He supported a Republican-sponsored effort in the state legislature to allow 12-hour holds for ICE if a judge determines the prisoner is a threat to public safety, but the amendment was voted down in April.
States act on detainers
Many experts agree that ICE detainers can be legally ignored if states allow sheriffs to do that.
“That detainer request is just that, a request, it’s not a requirement,” said Cassandra Charles, a staff attorney at the National Immigration Law Center, which is opposing Louisiana’s lawsuit to reverse a court-ordered ban on cooperation between Orleans Parish and ICE.
The general counsel for the North Carolina Sheriffs’ Association, Eddie Caldwell, agreed that the detainers are voluntary under federal law.
The association supports a state bill now under consideration that would require not only the 48-hour detention but also a notice sent 48 hours before release to let ICE know the clock is running. The proposal has passed the House.
The notification matters, Caldwell said, because there can be criminal proceedings that take weeks or months, so ICE in many cases doesn’t realize the 48-hour window has started.
Tillis’ office said the senator’s disagreement with McFadden, a Democrat, and other sheriffs is about that notification.
“It’s not necessarily that [sheriffs] are breaking the law, but rather making it as difficult as possible for ICE to take prisoners into custody by refusing to do some basic things. Notification is important,” said Daniel Keylin, a senior adviser to Tillis.
States including California, Colorado and Massachusetts ban compliance with the ICE detainers, on the general principle that it’s not enough reason to hold people in jails when they’re otherwise free to go because of bail or an end to their criminal cases. Those three states have made recent moves to defend or fine-tune their rules.
California’s attorney general also has issued guidance to local jurisdictions based on a 2017 state law limiting cooperation with immigration authorities. That law withstood a court challenge under the first Trump administration.
Colorado has a law against holding prisoners more than six hours longer than required, and a new bill sent to Democratic Gov. Jared Polis last week would specify that even those six hours can’t be for the purpose of an immigration detainer.
Iowa, Tennessee and Texas are among the states requiring cooperation with detainers.
And Florida has gone further, requiring sheriffs to actively help ICE write detainers though official agreements in which local agencies sign up to help enforce immigration laws.
Cooperation boosts arrests
Such cooperation makes a big difference, experts say — jails are the easiest place to pick up immigrants for deportation, and when local sheriffs and police help out, there are more arrests.
“A larger share of ICE arrests and deportations are happening in places where local law enforcement is cooperative with ICE,” said Julia Gelatt, associate director for the Migration Policy Institute’s U.S. Immigration Policy Program, speaking at a recent webinar.
“A declining share of arrests and deportations are happening from places like California, where there are really strict limitations on local law enforcement’s cooperation with ICE,” she added.
ICE is making about 600 immigration arrests daily, twice the rate as during the last year of the Biden administration, said Muzaffar Chishti, an attorney and policy expert at the Migration Policy Institute, speaking at the same event.
Reports on deportations are incomplete, Chishti said, but he estimated the current administration is on track to deport half a million people this year and is trying to get that number higher.
“The Trump administration has not been able to change the laws that are on the books, because only Congress can do that,” Chishti said. “It’s going to take congressional action for the Trump administration to achieve its aim of higher [arrest and deportation] numbers.”
President Donald Trump has added more pressure, last month requesting a list from Attorney General Pam Bondi and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem of sanctuary cities, which he says would face funding cuts. The administration also has sued some states, including Colorado, Illinois and New York, over their policies.
Asked for comment on the legality of funding cutoffs for sanctuary policies, Bondi’s office referred to a February memo in which she promised to “end funding to state and local jurisdictions that unlawfully interfere with federal law enforcement operations.” The memo cites a federal law saying local officials “may not prohibit, or in any way restrict” communication about immigration status.
Local jurisdictions in Connecticut, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon and Washington joined a February lawsuit led by the city and county of San Francisco and Santa Clara County in California against a Trump administration executive order calling for defunding cities with sanctuary policies, calling the order “illegal and authoritarian.”
In April, a U.S. district court in California issued a preliminary injunction in that case preventing any funding cutoff over sanctuary policies to the cities and counties in the lawsuit. And on Friday, the federal judge, William Orrick, ruled that the injunction applies to any list of sanctuary jurisdictions the administration may target for funding cuts.
Trump’s new executive order seeking the list cannot be used as “an end run” around Orrick’s injunction, the judge wrote, while he decides the legality of detainer policies and other issues.
“The litigation may not proceed with the coercive threat to end all federal funding hanging over the Cities and Counties’ heads like the sword of Damocles,” Orrick wrote.

Legislators adjourned their regular session earlier this year without agreeing on a budget, with the House and Senate, both Republican led, in a bitter political fight over numerous issues. Now, they’re trying to reach a final deal before the fiscal year ends on June 30.
If lawmakers do not pass a budget before the new budget year begins July 1, then most state agencies would shut down or temporarily close, though some court rulings and legal opinions have stated that some core agencies could still function. 
Rep. John Read, a Republican from Gautier who leads the House Appropriations A Committee, said budget leaders were still at an impasse when they met last week, but he believes they’ll get closer to a final deal after returning to the negotiating table this week. 
“You’re trying to get from A to B, and we have three people involved in discussions now,” Read said. “And each person thinks they’re right.” 
House Speaker Jason White and Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann would typically be the two leaders in budget negotiations. But the third person heavily involved in the discussions now is Republican Gov. Tate Reeves, the only person who can call lawmakers back into a special session.
The state Constitution gives the governor the power to set the legislative agenda for a special session, not lawmakers. This gives the constitutionally weak governor a significant boost in political power over special session work.
The governor’s office did not respond to a request for comment, but he said at a press conference recently that he wants legislative leaders to have at least a handshake agreement on the budget before calling them back to Jackson.  
Numerous rank-and-file lawmakers told Mississippi Today they have not received any formal notification from legislative leaders on when a special session might happen.
One of the major sticking points between the House and Senate is whether to pass a “Christmas Tree” bill, or a bill that appropriates hundreds of millions of dollars in local projects around the state. Read said the two chambers disagreed over other spending items, but he declined to elaborate on the specific disagreements. 
Christmas Tree bills are typically funded by excess state cash or borrowing, and the state currently has more than $1 billion in surplus. 
Legislative leaders often use the projects bill to reward members who vote in favor of their priorities or punish members wh0 oppose their plans, something that Sen. Jeremy England, a Republican from Vancleave, acknowledged in a social media post last week.
“What is the hold-up? The answer is this: ‘Project Money’ — also commonly called ‘Christmas Tree Items’ (because these ‘projects’ are handed out to members for their local districts, sometimes promised as incentives for votes on other items — particularly in the House, like gifts),” England wrote.
Speaker White has said House members are insisting the Legislature pass a local projects bill, but Hosemann, the Senate’s president officer, has said they’re reluctant to spend any excessive revenue on local projects, given looming federal spending cuts and a volatile national economy. 
“Senate leadership has met regularly with the House over the last couple of weeks, made progress on the budget, and will continue working on it this week,” Hosemann said in a statement. “We look to finalize it expeditiously. Given ongoing federal funding freezes and economic shifts, it is important that we exercise prudence in our spending as we craft this year’s budget.”
White’s office did not respond to a request for comment, but he told WAPT TV last week that an ongoing disagreement between the two chambers is over funding the public employee pension system and a Christmas Tree bill. 
The first-term speaker told the outlet that he wouldn’t be “much of a leader” if he didn’t reward mayors and supervisors with local project money after they supported his effort this year to pass legislation eliminating the individual income tax. 
The budget dispute comes as Mississippi is collecting less tax revenue than it did at this point last year, according to the latest revenue collections report from the Legislative Budget Office. 
The report states that year-to-date revenue collections through April are more than $78 million below last year’s collections, or roughly 1.23% less than the previous year.  In general, revenue collections have been trending down for months, but have been buoyed, in part, by strong interest earnings on the sizable pot of reserve funds the state has maintained.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/06061413/3X0A2107-copy-scaled.jpg,,,2025-05-14 07:04:47.478702

Some 57 percent of voters think that the cost of housing is a ""a big problem"" in their own communities, according to a new poll conducted by the MassINC Polling Group for Abundant Housing Massachusetts, and 68 percent think there aren't enough affordable homes in their own cities or towns. 
The post Voters support more action to boost housing, new poll find[...]","IN HOUSING DEBATES, it’s only a matter of time before critiques of damaging “neighborhood character” and some flavor of “not in my back yard” clash with assertions that the Massachusetts housing market is so squeezed that building almost anything at all should be a priority. Common wisdom usually boils down to residents wanting to preserve their community while home values rise, suggesting that other communities would be better suited for more units. But new polling conducted by the MassINC Polling Group for Abundant Housing Massachusetts – which is pushing two bills this legislative session to spur development – finds that majorities of voters feel that the state and their own communities alike are not doing enough to address the housing crunch. “Many polls have found housing at or near the top of the list of issues facing the state,” said Richard Parr, research director with The MassINC Polling Group, which is partly owned by MassINC, the nonprofit organization that publishes CommonWealth Beacon. “What more interesting is that voters think this is a problem their own communities should be doing more on.” Some 57 percent of voters think that the cost of housing is a “a big problem” in their own communities, and 68 percent think there aren’t enough affordable homes in their own cities or towns. By wide margins, Parr noted, voters favor building more housing over both protecting neighborhood character (71 percent to 21 percent) or preserving local control over what can be built (63 percent to 28 percent).  “All this suggests that the voices who speak out at community meetings against new housing projects are likely not a majority in their own communities,” he said. The poll surveyed 803 Massachusetts voters between March 17 and 20, with a credibility interval of plus or minus 3.8 percentage points. Jesse Kanson-Benanav, executive director of Abundant Housing Massachusetts, said responses are aligned with the goals of a “Yes in My Back Yard” bill and a bill to study allowing apartment buildings up to six stories to be built with one stairway for more efficient use of square footage.  Majorities of voters polled offered support for policies like allowing construction on smaller lots, allowing owners to subdivide their lots and sell homes on those new parcels, allowing owners to determine how much paved parking area should be on their property, and single-stair construction.  “There’s been a lot of conversation in the press and the Legislature around zoning reform in particular and making sure we have the tools in communities across the Commonwealth to build the homes that Massachusetts residents need,” said Kanson-Benanav. “Some of the conversation has helped advance the perception that, broadly speaking, Massachusetts voters are opposed to state action that will make sure they have access to more variety in the types of homes they can choose to live in and the communities where they can live.” A voter survey finding support for these policies is a double boon for housing groups. Voters are more likely to be homeowners – 65 percent of respondents said they owned a home, indicating that even those with property values on the line would like to see more available housing near them – and engaged at the polls even if their contributions aren’t captured in public meetings. “Local control is important,” Kanson-Benanav said. “Local control is never going away. The Town Meeting form of government is never going away, but we have to balance that with the fact that the way it has played out is just not serving the needs of Massachusetts residents,” he said, plus “it’s not meeting the desires of community members broadly.” A few months into the lieutenant governor job, former Salem mayor Kim Driscoll touted her home city and Massachusetts as “welcoming and inclusive” but also attracting populations that are having trouble staying because of the housing affordability crisis. Statewide research in 2022 from The Boston Foundation found that officials and public meeting participants are demographically homogenous and in-person gatherings often oppose new housing. “Sometimes voices get crowded out,” Driscoll said on an episode of The Codcast in May 2023. “Sometimes newer local residents to communities don’t also engage in that same meaningful way. We’ve all taken stock of who’s participating during meetings, and oftentimes populations that show up at the zoning board hearing or at the city council or town meeting are older, whiter, more conservative, and housing secure and, frankly, often fighting new housing.” Local control and local character have become flashpoints in hashing out compliance with the MBTA Communities housing law, which requires the 177 cities and towns served by the MBTA system to rezone to allow for more multi-family housing.  Most polling, but not all, has found consistent majority support for the MBTA Communities law. Some towns have chafed against its requirements and the state’s toolkit for enforcing the law through the courts and by withholding grant funding, though all but four of the communities that must offer rezoning plans by mid-July are now complaint or in interim compliance, according to state counts. A graphic from the Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities displaying compliance with Section 3A, also known as the MBTA Communities law.Only Halifax, Marshfield, Middleton, and rebellion ground zero Milton have not yet submitted plans to the state. The state’s high court concluded earlier this year that the zoning law is constitutional and enforceable, though some towns are pushing back by arguing that the law is an  “unfunded mandate” because it imposes costs on the municipalities without providing a source of funding to address those costs.  An ongoing Plymouth Superior Court case was brought by the town of Marshfield against the state housing office, demanding an exemption from compliance. The court is considering a motion to dismiss the suit. Milton, meanwhile, is moving ahead with some grumbling. The town’s planning board will work into the summer to have a rezoning plan by the state’s July 14 deadline. At a Milton Planning Board meeting on May 8, several residents and planning board members continued to argue that the Mattapan High Speed Trolley line that passes through the eastern part of the town should not be considered comparable to other “rapid transit” options and therefore should come with a lower rezoning burden. Others expressed disappointment with the continuing back-and-forth over the rezoning process, describing the town as increasingly unaffordable to public employees and young people. Recent attempts to re-open the MBTA Communities debate through the state budget process have fizzled. An amendment offered by Rep. Kenneth Sweezey, a Duxbury Republican, but rejected by the chamber would have stripped the attorney general’s power to enforce the MBTA Communities law. The House dispensed with three MBTA Communities amendments – which would have extended the MBTA Community definition to all Massachusetts municipalities, expanded the definition of compliance, and excluded cities and towns without direct bus or subway service from being counted as an MBTA Community – offered by the House Republican leader Brad Jones, of North Reading, by opting not to include them in a consolidated amendment. The Senate, similarly, rejected amendments offering similar MBTA Communities changes proposed by Sen. Kelly Dooner, a Taunton Republican. Sen. William Driscoll, a Milton Democrat, withdrew an amendment declaring that the Mattapan High Speed Line “shall not be considered a rapid transit modality.” In the new Abundant Housing Massachusetts poll, surveyors did not measure specific support for the current version of MBTA Communities, but did ask if voters would support expanding the law to allow more housing options near public transit in all cities and towns with train and bus service statewide. Almost 80 percent said they somewhat or strongly supported the idea. The post Voters support more action to boost housing, new poll finds  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hull_Housing.png?fit=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-14 06:00:52.660627

(Getty Images)I could potentially win the lottery. It could happen, but odds are it won’t. The same can be said for a meaningless executive order on drug pricing signed by President Donald Trump Monday containing no policy specifics and designed to distract Americans from the Republican assault on health care. 
That’s why it was disappointing to see a local news organization and health care advocates celebrating the executive order’s “potential” to lower drug prices. Don’t be fooled! The president has no real intention of lowering drug prices — this is all smoke and mirrors to disguise the fact that Republicans in Congress are actively working right now to rip away health care from millions of families to fund tax breaks for billionaires and big corporations — including Big Pharma.
Trump has always been all talk and no action when it comes to drug prices. He had four years to lower drug costs during his first term and accomplished nothing. In fact, drug prices soared under Trump. 
He installed Big Pharma executives in key administration posts and handed out huge tax breaks to big drug companies, cutting Big Pharma’s effective tax rate by 40 percent but did nothing to lower drug prices.
An executive order signed by Trump on April 15 instructs Congress to side with big drug companies and undermine Medicare drug prices negotiation, giving drug companies four additional years to charge as much as they want for certain drugs before they can be selected to have a lower price negotiated. 
This executive order is more of the same meaningless fluff. It includes no detail on the authority the administration would use to execute the plan, so it is unclear how such a plan would be operationalized or legal. It’s more about padding Big Pharma’s profits abroad than it is about lowering costs here at home. After all, these drug companies are driven by profit and greed.
So, why the distraction? Why now? After repeatedly denying that Medicaid would be cut or that people would be hurt and have their benefits taken away, Medicaid is currently facing the largest cut in its history. 
Under the cover of darkness on Mother’s Day, Republicans on the House Energy and Commerce Committee released the text of their budget proposal, putting forth its plan to kick millions off their health care by enacting the largest cuts to Medicaid in history, raising costs on low-income families, closing rural hospitals, and enacting burdensome work requirements designed to deny people coverage. Millions of Americans — and  thousands of West Virginians — could lose coverage, including seniors, children, veterans, people with disabilities, workers who don’t get insurance through their jobs and people who take care of their children or elderly parents. 
In addition to draconian Medicaid cuts, Republicans are raising premiums and out-of-pocket costs for tens of millions of people who buy coverage on their own. These Republican price hikes will force middle-class families to lose their coverage altogether. 
House Republicans are betraying their own voters and making health care more expensive. Such drastic health care cuts will throw working families off coverage and into medical debt, take critical long-term care away from seniors and people with disabilities, shutter rural hospitals and leave children uninsured. This Republican budget will hurt people — all to give tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans.
Republicans in Congress continue to lie about the devastating impact their budget will have on people and communities across the country because they know how cruel and unpopular their war on health care is. Poll after poll after poll — even Trump’s own pollster — has found the majority of Americans, including a majority of Republicans, oppose any cuts to Medicaid or the Affordable Care Act. Yet, this Republican budget will give tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans at the expense of the medical care and financial stability of everyone else.
Not a single dollar should be taken from health care to fund tax breaks for billionaires.",https://westvirginiawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-1026036240-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-14 06:00:52.660627

(Photo: NCGA screengrab)North Carolina House and Senate Democrats held a funeral of sorts Tuesday, highlighting the hundreds of bills they introduced this session that were then directed to the Rules Committees of the two houses, the proverbial legislative graveyard.
Senate Democratic Leader Sydney Batch (D-Wake) said Democrats introduced over 700 bills this session that were killed in committee.
“Common sense, community focused solutions to our state’s biggest problems — and they went nowhere,” Batch said. “Republicans didn’t debate or defeat these ideas. They shoved them in drawers, locked them behind doors, and they prayed every single day that the public never finds out how little they’re actually doing with their tax dollars that you will send to this state to run our government.”
Batch said gerrymandering has allowed Republicans, who chair the committees, to completely control which bills advance and which never see the light of day.
Sen. Woodson Bradley (D-Mecklenburg) said she came to Raleigh hoping to make communities safer, only to find her ideas silenced by the majority party.
“I may be a freshman senator, but I’m also a domestic violence survivor. I’m a responsible gun owner and concealed carry holder. I’m the daughter and wife of law enforcement. I know crime. I know cops. But more important than that, less than 5% of the people in this building know what it’s like to be a victim. And that’s who I came here to help,” said the Mecklenburg County Democrat.
  Sen. Woodson Bradley (D-Mecklenburg) said her simple two-page bill would have helped domestic violence victims. It was never debated.
Bradley said the ideas she championed were basic protections and deserved to be fully debated.
“We hear a lot from the other side about protecting families and standing with law enforcement. But if you won’t even bring a bill to the table that protects survivors of abuse or helps officers prevent gun violence, what are you standing for?”
Sen. Lisa Grafstein (D-Wake) said that even ideas that had merit like allowing remote license renewals to ease the NC DMV backlog were dismissed, if the idea came from a Democrat.
“Democrats introduced real solutions for fixing what ails us in state government, hiring critical staff, investing in the infrastructure behind state services. But Republicans actually didn’t want to fix it. They wanted to exploit the failings to support their talking-point that government doesn’t work.”
Senate Bill 611 would have taken an estimated one million North Carolinians out of lines at the DMV allowing them to complete their task online, said Grafstein. But Republicans kept the bill bottled up and allowed it to die rather than make the May 8 crossover deadline.
“The Republican majority would rather have people stand in line all day and get frustrated because it fits that narrative that we just need to slash more and privatize.”
Rep. Lindsay Prather (D-Buncombe) said bills that would restore teacher longevity pay and establish a $17 an hour minimum salary for non-certified public school employees also failed to gain traction.
Legislative leaders also dismissed both the Voucher School Accountability Act and the Voucher School Transparency Act.
  Rep. Dante Pittman (D-Wilson)
“These are bills that would shine a light on private schools receiving public funds, giving more information to parents to make an informed decision, and more information to taxpayers on whether your money is actually going to provide a quality education to a North Carolina student.”
Prather said decisions not to take up those bills shortchanged North Carolina’s children and their parents.
“Not all hope is lost”
As a Captain in the US Army National Guard, Rep. Dante Pittman (D-Wilson) said he has learned not to surrender.
He’s still advocating this session for the Working Families Act (House Bill 786) that would raise the state’s minimum wage, increase the stock of affordable housing and reenact the child tax credit.
“Not all hope is lost. And I would offer for them to take these good ideas and include them in the budget.
Because what we’re trying to do here in North Carolina is make sure that our children have the opportunity that they need and our families are secure.”

(Photo courtesy WWBT)An overwhelming majority of voters are proud of Virginia’s colleges and universities and feel they are equipping young people to succeed, even as, across the country, frustrations mount due to rapidly shifting federal education systems and rising tuition costs.
According to poll results released by Virginia Business Higher Education Council (VBHEC), 90% of respondents both Democrats and Republicans in Virginia are proud of the colleges and universities in the commonwealth because they see a “strong connection” between the work on Virginia’s campuses, the prospects for the state’s economy to grow and for young people to succeed in the job market.
Virginia voters’ views contrast national surveys from the Pew Research Center and Third Way, which found both Republican and Democratic voters cited high costs as one of the key reasons for the lack of confidence in institutions over the past few years. While most Democratic respondents pinpointed rising costs and quality as concerns about the quality of higher education in America, Republican respondents said “professors bringing their political and social views into the classroom is a major reason why the higher education system is headed in the wrong direction,” according to the Pew survey. 
The VBHEC poll results found that 90% of Virginians want their children to attend one of Virginia’s public colleges and universities and 81% of respondents said Virginia’s colleges are doing a good job of preparing young people for success in a changing economy. Conversely, 21% of Republicans and 12% of Democrats said Virginia colleges are doing a bad job in these areas.
Public Opinion Strategies and Frederick polls, two national opinion firms representing both parties Republicans and Democrats, conducted the VBHEC study in December with 800 registered Virginia voters aged 18 and older. The margin of error for the survey is ±3.95%.
Founded in 1994, the VBHEC’s mission is to enhance the performance of Virginia’s public colleges, universities, and community colleges and their state funding so institutions can produce a significant impact on Virginia’s economy.
Dennis Treacy, chair of the Virginia Business Higher Education Council, said in a statement that the link between higher education, the growth of the commonwealth’s economy, and the lifelong success of its young people is “crystal clear” to all Virginians.
“They get it. They know that when we invest in our colleges, universities, and community colleges — making degrees and credentials affordable for all and providing work-based learning opportunities that prepare students for the jobs and careers of tomorrow — the commonwealth is stronger for it,” said Treacy.
Last year, CNBC named Virginia the best state to do business after examining the commonwealth’s K-12 public schools and higher education institutions.
Kirk Cox, president of the Virginia Business Higher Education Council and former Virginia House Speaker, said it’s “unusual” to find something that unites all Virginians, considering the current volatile political environment. He said the VBHEC’s poll results should send a message to all current and aspiring political leaders.
“Whatever disagreements voters may have on other issues, one thing that very large majorities in both parties strongly agree about is the need to prioritize investments in our top-ranked higher education so we maintain our competitive advantage as the ‘talent state’ and so young Virginians and career-changing adults have the credentials they need to succeed,” Cox said in a statement.

(Photo by Charles Paullin/Inside Climate News)RICHMOND, Va.–Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed two bills for the development of small solar projects and energy storage that had won bipartisan votes and support from Dominion Energy, environmental groups and farm and forestry representatives.
The bills would have encouraged private homes and companies to initiate solar projects and bolstered the existing utility’s efforts to capture electricity from renewable sources for later use. Dominion said in April, in an application to purchase electricity from third-party suppliers, that enhanced solar production and its own plans to store electricity would result in billions of dollars of fuel savings through 2035.
Youngkin has described himself as an “all-of-the-above” energy supporter with plans to support fossil fuel sources as well as renewable technologies. Critics said the vetoes last week raise questions about his commitment to clean energy and illustrate his disdain for the state’s landmark decarbonization law, the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA).
The Republican governor, enthusiastic about the development of data centers in the state, has in the past year supported a proposed natural gas peaker plant and renewable sources to encourage such development. But Youngkin rejected the current legislation over his concern that ratepayers for existing utilities, which are reliant on fossil fuel, would bear in part the cost of increased solar production, according to a statement released Tuesday.
“He does not support legislation that puts rate payers at risk,” Peter Finocchio, Youngkin’s press secretary, said in an email.
Regarding battery storage efforts, Youngkin said that he was relying on market forces. “Long-duration energy storage is an expensive technology and if utilities believed it to be the best technology to meet demand, they would actively be seeking permission to build them. We must be vigilant to limit cost increases to Virginia’s residents,” he said in a “veto explanation” released on a state website.
Josephus Allmond, a staff attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, said the governor’s action fit a pattern. For months, Youngkin has supported legislation to weaken the VCEA or completely repeal it, he said.
“I think the amendments just show who he truly is: not an ‘all-of-the-above’ guy. He just doesn’t like clean energy,” Allmond said. “It’s disappointing that the governor chose to engage with [the energy legislation] in such an unserious way. We thought we had good meetings.”
Dominion Energy spokesperson Aaron Ruby did not respond to requests for comment.
Legislation sponsored by Del. Katrina Callsen (D-Charlottesville) and Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg (D-Henrico) would have increased small solar projects to further diversify the state’s energy mix. “Regrettably, Governor Youngkin’s veto indicates a prioritization of political motives aligned with Washington rather than the interest of Virginians,” Callsen said in a statement.

The VCEA, passed in 2020, mandates that Dominion and Appalachian Power Company have carbon-free energy portfolios within three decades. The state utility regulator oversees an evolving system of credits that encourages utilities to shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy production.
Beginning in 2021, Dominion was required to obtain renewable energy credits, equaling a percentage of its electricity sales, from renewable energy sources. Dominion satisfied its annual credit requirement, including a 1 percent stipulation for small solar projects, according to a 2023 regulatory filing. Callsen and VanValkenburg’s bill aimed to increase credit payments toward small solar projects and, in turn, generate such projects. Under the bill, Dominion would have been required by 2028 to pay 5 percent in renewable energy credits for small solar projects.
From 2029 through 2031, and every three years after, the state utility regulator would have set the energy credits levels for utilities.
The bill also considered some broader solar aims for Virginia. It sought more commercial solar projects, capable of providing up to 3 megawatts of electricity each, to comprise 1,100 megawatts in total. Those projects by private developers would contribute to the overall goal of 16,100 megawatts in solar power across the state by 2035.
Solar projects planned for brownfields, including landfills and former industrial sites that are underutilized, would have been required to have a capacity for 600 megawatts, tripling the current 200-megawatt minimum.
Dominion Energy, which supplies electricity in parts of Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina, supported the expansion of home solar users in part because the utility could benefit. The bill would have extended a deadline for Dominion to recover costs for its strategic program to install distribution lines underground from 2028 to 2032, and delayed a demand for Dominion to recover deficiency payments, or penalties for shortfalls in obtaining credits, from ratepayers. The utility expects an offshore wind project to be operational in 2026, which would offset its credit payments.

Youngkin, in his veto memo, balked at the renewable credit plan. Customers would likely have to bear the cost of Dominion’s renewable payments, he said, equalling billions of dollars over 10 years.
Allmond, of the Southern Environmental Law Center, said Youngkin’s cost numbers were inflated and ignored the benefits of new renewable sources, “including lower fuel costs.”
“If you actually look at those benefits and put it in context—Dominion customers will pay over $20B for fossil fuel costs alone over the next decade,” Allmond said in an email. “That number … does not include the health costs that those fossil fuels impose on the communities in which they are combusted.”
Clean energy industry representatives saw the veto as a lost chance. The bills would have increased an individual’s options for solar at home—by adding rooftop panels—and ease the overall demand in the state, said Jim Purekal, a director at Advanced Energy United, a national trade organization that represents clean-energy companies.
“If I’m putting solar panels on my house, I’m not charging Joe down the road for the solar panels. I’m paying for the solar panels,” Purekal said. “The energy that I’m generating off of the solar panels, I’m contributing to the grid. I’m not asking for Joe to pay for my solar panels, I’m just asking Joe to pay for the electricity that I’m providing to the grid.”
There are costs to changing the energy landscape, but time eases the burden, according to a recent report by the federal Energy Information Administration. “Distributed generation systems often cost more per unit of capacity than utility-scale systems,” it said in a 2024 report, but noted that savings would follow.
“Cost reductions are expected to continue in the coming years as component markets stabilize, component efficiencies continue to improve, customers and developers take advantage of federal and state incentives, and developers achieve economies of scale through alternative sales strategies,” the report said.
The second veto affected an energy storage and distribution bill, joint legislation from Del. Rip Sullivan (D-Fairfax) and Sen. Lamont Bagby (D-Richmond).
Their bill would have almost doubled traditional battery facility targets for Dominion as well as Appalachian Power Co., which serves a million customers in West Virginia, Virginia and Tennessee. Dominion’s goal for battery storage facilities would have increased to 5,220 megawatts from 2,700 megawatts. Appalachian Power’s goal would have risen to 780 megawatts, from 400.
The bill would have also created long-duration energy storage targets so that electricity could be dispatched over a 10- to 24-hour period, including when sunshine and wind are not available.
Sullivan described the veto as dismissive of clean energy and the VCEA: “The governor just couldn’t bring himself to do the right thing for Virginia.”
“Instead of signing 2537, or even suggesting to us constructive changes, which of course we’d have entertained,” Sullivan said, “he has used it to give the Clean Economy Act one last sort of derisive swipe at the back of his hand as he prepares to walk out the door toward his next campaign.”
Virginia’s utility regulator, the State Corporation Commission, had approved Dominion’s proposed construction of long-duration energy storage facilities in 2024. On April 15, Dominion was approved to purchase electricity from third-party storage suppliers.
In its application leading to the regulator’s approval in April, Dominion said its plan for a combination of solar and the storage projects would “result in fuel savings of approximately $6.6 billion over the period of 2022 through 2035. Fuel savings for the full lives of all resources in this Development Plan which extend through 2073 are approximately $118.5 billion.”
Tension over the VCEA has percolated for years. Youngkin has called the VCEA a “quagmire,” and Republicans have derided the VCEA as a force that will increase electricity costs. Environmental groups have consistently played defense to prevent weakening of zero-carbon goals.
Beyond the vetoes, Youngkin approved a bill from Sen. Ghazala Hashmi (D-Richmond) and Rep. Phil Hernandez (D-Norfolk) to expand a “virtual power plant” pilot program to be designed by the state regulator. The program would allow ratepayers to agree to share electricity with utilities during peak strains on the system. Utilities then would draw electricity from home or business battery storage devices and adjust on-site smart thermostats to ease demand on the electric grid.
Angela Navarro, a former State Corporation Commission judge who has since opened up her own energy policy law firm, said thousands of customers could participate and help cope with electricity demand and their own energy costs.
“It’s expensive to provide power during those peak events,” Navarro said. “There’s scarcity on the grid. You are providing value, you are alleviating some of that scarcity and therefore you should be compensated for it.”

The region stood out for its high employment rate among mothers, robust remote work options, competitive income levels, and strong access to child care, education and healthcare. 
According to the report, 77% of mothers in the Washington region are employed — four percentage points above the national average. About 26% of those working moms have remote jobs, one of the highest rates among major metropolitan areas nationwide.
The metro area’s performance reflects both workforce trends and longstanding infrastructure. Working mothers here earn a median income of $70,000 — the third highest among the nation’s largest metros. 
And despite an average commute time of 32 minutes — longer than the national average of 25.4 minutes — many are offsetting that strain with flexible work-from-home arrangements and the growing availability of coworking spaces, with nearly seven available per 100,000 working-age adults.
Child care access is another factor lifting the region’s ranking. The area boasts roughly 1,000 child care centers and 100 schools per 100,000 children, helping it land sixth place nationally for education metrics. While child care costs average $13,800 annually — or about 9.2% of a typical family’s income — the availability and quality of services play a key role in supporting working parents, the analysis noted.
Health care access is also a major advantage. Nearly three-quarters of employed mothers in the region — 74.4% — receive employer-based health coverage, compared to the national average of 70.4%. Pediatric care is also robust, with approximately 591 pediatricians per 100,000 children under age 21.
The new ranking analyzed large metros based on employment rates for mothers, income, work flexibility, commute times, and access to childcare, education, health care and environmental quality. 
The Washington area ranked behind only one other large metro in the nation — Minneapolis — reinforcing its status as a leading hub for women striving to balance professional and parental responsibilities.
While air quality ranked 18th among large metros, the region’s overall infrastructure and support systems make it one of the most favorable places in the country for mothers trying to balance it all.
In addition to the region’s inherent strengths, recent legislative actions in Virginia aim to further support working mothers. The Virginia General Assembly passed a comprehensive “momnibus” package to improve maternal health outcomes, including legislation allowing doulas to assist during labor and increasing postpartum doula visits for Medicaid recipients. 
These measures address maternal health disparities and aim to provide better support for mothers across the state.
Furthermore, the legislature approved a $200 rebate for taxpayers and bonuses for state employees and teachers, providing financial relief that can benefit working families.
While proposals for permanent car tax credits and tax cuts on tips were excluded from the final budget, the enacted measures reflect a commitment to supporting working parents through both health care and economic initiatives.

(Photo by Marty Schladen, Ohio Capital Journal.)The Ohio History Connection last week laid off a third of the staff at the State Office of Historic Preservation. Even though many of its responsibilities are mandated by the federal government, the feds haven’t provided funding that was appropriated in October, a spokesman said.
The money is provided by the National Park Service, which has been hammered by staffing and funding cuts from Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency.
The historic preservation office handles Ohio listings on the National Register of Historic Places, historic preservation tax incentives, and maintains a permanent record of Ohio’s historic buildings and sites, in addition to many other responsibilities. 
The Ohio History Connection, which oversees the preservation office, laid off 12 of its employees because it hasn’t received $1.448 million from the National Park Service despite the fact that the money was appropriated on Oct. 1, said Neil Thompson, the history connection’s manager of media and public relations.
In a note to history connection staff last week, Executive Director and CEO Megan Wood said the preservation office couldn’t maintain its staffing without the money.
“As a reminder, roughly 60% of (the preservation office’s) funding comes from the federal Historic Preservation Fund — administered by the National Park Service and supported by proceeds from offshore oil and gas leases,” Wood wrote. “Although these funds were appropriated for the current federal fiscal year beginning October 1, 2024, they have not yet been released.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
 “We have been working tirelessly with the Governor’s Office, our Board, and Ohio’s Congressional Delegation to advocate for the timely release of these funds. However, with the majority of our (historic preservation) budget allocated to personnel, we are unable to sustain our current staffing levels without this federal support.”
In 1966, Congress passed the National Historic Preservation Act after years of mass demolition of historic sites and buildings.
“By the mid-1960s, federally-funded infrastructure and urban renewal projects had resulted in the rapid destruction of places significant in the nation’s history,” the National Park Service says on its website. “Congress recognized that the federal government’s historic preservation program was inadequate to ensure that future generations could appreciate and enjoy the rich heritage of the nation. (The National Historic Preservation Act) was enacted in recognition that historic places were being lost or altered, and that preservation was in the public’s interest.”
Among the things created under the law was the National Register of Historic Places, on which Columbus’s German Village has been listed since 1974. 
Workers in state preservation offices evaluate whether nominees make the register. Those decisions depend on how old they are, their historical significance, their architectural significance, and other factors, Thompson said. 
“It’s a federal program — a federal list that is ultimately put out by the Department of the Interior — but the State Historic Preservation Office is responsible for reviewing nominations to ensure all these factors are met,” Thompson said.
A more complete description of the preservation office’s responsibilities can be found here.
Some developers and homeowners might balk at historic preservation requirements, but historic preservation is popular with the public. For example, a 2014 UCLA survey found that “88% of respondents believe that historic places should be treated as community assets… (and) 83% of respondents indicated that historic preservation is somewhat to very important.”
The National Park Service didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The agency has been buffeted with cuts and threats of more since Trump took office and put the world’s richest man in charge of cutting government services.
In February, 1,000 probationary employees were cut from the park service and another 700 took buyouts. Now the Trump administration is planning to cut 1,500 more. The cuts already are said to have sewn chaos at the agency.
Despite the loss of personnel at Ohio’s State Historic Preservation Office, officials plan to continue doing what the law requires. 
“Despite this setback, we remain responsible for fulfilling our federally mandated duties, including the administration of the National Register of Historic Places, the Federal Historic Tax Credit program, and compliance reviews under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act,” Wood, CEO of the History Connection, told employees.
 “We know the coming months will be challenging, and that extended processing times may occur as we adjust to these changes. Nonetheless, we remain committed to our mission and to serving the people and communities of Ohio through the preservation of our shared heritage.”

A new study suggests that direct financial aid reduces parole violations and eases reentry. (Photo courtesy of the Center for Employment Opportunities)When Karina Lariz was released from a California prison in September 2021, she had only the clothes she was arrested in — stretched out and weathered by time. She had lost her home, her car and her job. Her two children had moved in with other family members.
“I didn’t have nothing, everything that I had within those two weeks of coming home was what I found in donation bins,” recalled Lariz, who was incarcerated for three years. She added: “I was so worried about, ‘How am I going to get to these different programs? Where am I going to sleep at?’”
After her release, Lariz spent two days at a motel before moving into a transitional home. She also participated in a job training program.
Then came an unexpected lifeline: direct cash payments through a nonprofit program called the Returning Citizens Stimulus. The Center for Employment Opportunities, an organization that offers reentry support and services to formerly incarcerated people in 28 cities, runs the program.

With the money, Lariz, 35, was able to buy clothes for job interviews, cover groceries and public transportation fare, and begin rebuilding her life and relationships. The money, totaling nearly $2,500 over three payments, helped her gain footing in the weeks following her release — a period often marked by high risk of recidivism and reincarceration.
“It liberated a lot of stress,” she said.
Now, a new independent evaluation of the initiative suggests that short-term aid may have positive long-term effects. The study comes as some states are considering whether direct financial support is an effective — or appropriate — tool for reducing recidivism.
In 2022, Lariz landed a job with the very organization that helped fund her reentry. She now works as a program associate on the organizing team at the Center for Employment Opportunities, where she helps others leaving prison.
Nearly four years after her release, Lariz is married and again living with her two children.
“If I didn’t have that support, I would have not pushed myself to do half of the things that I did,” Lariz said.
She is one of more than 10,000 formerly incarcerated people across 28 cities who received support through the Center for Employment Opportunities’ stimulus program, which launched in April 2020.











If I didn't have that support, I would have not pushed myself to do half of the things that I did.


– Karina Lariz, cash assistance recipient



The national organization works with local agencies to distribute up to $2,750 in cash over 60 days, contingent on participants completing basic milestones, such as creating a resume or attending a job readiness workshop. More than 80% of participants complete their milestones and receive the full payments.
People leaving prison often face staggering rates of joblessness, homelessness and food insecurity. Most program participants used the funds to cover food, rent, utilities or public transportation fare. Some participants also used the money to pay off credit card and medical debt.
“The basics of survival are this acute challenge in those early days of reentry, and then you layer on that sort of the big structural challenges,” said Sam Schaeffer, the executive director and CEO of the Center for Employment Opportunities. “Just putting food on the table, just getting to work, just getting that set of interview clothes is so critical.”
The new study supports that assessment.
Efforts to release prisoners from long sentences draw new interest

According to the study — which was conducted by MDRC, a research organization focusing on poverty reduction — participants were significantly less likely to violate parole than peers who did not receive payments. Within the first six months after release, parole violations fell by more than 41%, with violent parole violations dropping by 64%. The study evaluated the outcomes of people who were released in 2020 in Los Angeles and Alameda counties in California.
Roughly 77 million Americans — or about 1 in 3 adults — have a criminal record, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. That includes records of arrests, charges and criminal convictions. Formerly incarcerated people often face stigma and major barriers in the job market.
They also often return home without savings or financial resources and earn less than half as much as peers who have never been incarcerated over their careers, according to a 2020 report by the Brennan Center for Justice, a left-leaning law and policy institute at the New York University School of Law.
Legislation and pilot programs
A bill introduced in the New York legislature earlier this year would create a reentry fund to offer cash payments of $425 each month for up to six months for eligible residents leaving prison. The bill has been stalled in committee since January and is unlikely to pass before the legislature adjourns in June.
Some critics say that the proposed New York program is a redundant and unrestricted handout for people with criminal records, and question whether limited public safety funds should support individuals already eligible for state services, including Medicaid, food assistance, job placement programs and housing aid.
“This is just one more element of what is an overall theme by the Democrats here in Albany to coddle criminals and put their priorities over the priorities of victims and law-abiding citizens,” New York state Sen. George Borrello, a Republican, told Stateline.
‘Transformative’: More college programs are slowly coming into prisons

This isn’t the first time states have considered offering stipends to people leaving prison.
Most recently, legislators in Colorado in 2024 and North Carolina in 2023 proposed bills that would have provided monthly payments to formerly incarcerated individuals. Neither bill made it out of its originating chamber, but both bills proposed up to $3,000 in support.
In Colorado, the pilot program would have offered money for basic living expenses to those who enrolled in workforce training programs following incarceration in a state facility. In North Carolina, the proposal would have provided monthly stipends for housing, food, clothing and transportation for up to six months after release.
Similar pilot cash assistance programs have launched in New Haven, Connecticut; Gainesville, Florida; and Philadelphia.
The Gainesville program, which ran from January 2022 to February 2023, had 115 participants. They received $1,000 in the first month, followed by monthly payments of $600. An impact report released in February found that participants experienced greater financial security, reduced mental stress and lower rates of recidivism.
Potential savings
In 2022 — the most recent year with available data from the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics and the U.S. Census Bureau’s annual survey of state and local government finances — state governments spent $58 billion to incarcerate more than 1 million people in state facilities.
How many inmates return to prison? Inconsistent reporting makes it hard to tell.

Forty-four percent of all state prison admissions in 2021 were people who violated the terms of their parole or probation sentences, according to a 2024 report by the Council of State Governments Justice Center. On any given day, 1 in 4 people in state prison were incarcerated due to supervision violations — costing states more than $10 billion collectively.
Some critics maintain that the most effective way to prevent crime is to punish those who break the law.
“We do not do enough to hold people accountable,” said Borrello, the New York state senator who opposes the bill that would create a reentry fund in his state. “I really don’t give any credence to [supporters’] thoughts on whether or not they think this is going to save money down the road.”
For people such as Karina Lariz, though, the impact is personal and profound.
“I’ve been able to redefine and find who I am today, like the real Karina — not the Karina that grew up in trauma and all the problems that I had before incarceration,” she said.

(Getty Images)The New Hampshire Senate is set to vote Thursday on a bill aimed at creating a consistent building code across the entire state — by preventing local officials from creating their own rules.
If enacted, House Bill 428 — which was sponsored by Goffstown Republican Rep. Joe Alexander and co-sponsored by a group of his Republican colleagues — would forbid local officials in New Hampshire from amending the building code within their municipality, creating a uniform code across the state. This bill would leave the state Legislature as the only body able to amend that code. If enacted, it wouldn’t go into effect until January 2027, an attempt by lawmakers to give municipalities time to comply.
“Currently under state law, municipalities are able to make changes to the state code that are more stringent,” Alexander said when introducing the bill in January. “This causes the possibility of hundreds of different codes across the state. Can you see where that’s an issue?”
The House approved this bill through a voice vote in March after amending it to allow for variations in administrative rules, such as processes for applying for building permits or fees paid to building departments. Substantive changes to the building code itself remain prohibited under the amended bill. The Senate Executive Departments and Administration Committee voted, 4-1, to recommend the entire Senate approve the bill.
Rep. Carol McGuire, an Epsom Republican and co-sponsor of the bill, said during a hearing last month that “a number of municipalities have adopted amendments that severely undermine the ability of people to work between one town and the next.”
Alexander, McGuire, and their fellow co-sponsors argue that having so much variety between the building codes of different towns and cities makes it difficult for home builders who do business in multiple municipalities. Following these varying codes also increases their costs and makes homes more expensive, they argued.
“You have a patchwork of different types of building codes across the state, which makes it much more difficult for people to do business,” McGuire continued. “The principle is that we think if we have a state building code, it should be the state building code.”
Matt Mayberry, CEO of the New Hampshire Home Builders Association, commended the bill for helping ensure “one state, one code.”
Mayberry said he’s “not excited” that the bill waits until 2027 to take effect, “but I understand it, I guess.” He said he liked the bill because he’d rather see decisions made by the state Legislature over local boards and councils.
“I put my trust in 424 individuals to make those policy decisions for our state of New Hampshire versus a five-member town council or select board who may be more socially driven than policy driven,” Mayberry said.
Margaret Byrnes, with the New Hampshire Municipal Association, testified in January that her organization, which represents towns and cities throughout the state, opposed the bill. She said it would “take away established local authority to adopt local codes, which has been established in state law for many years.” She also urged lawmakers not to proceed with this bill until they can see the impacts of changes made by lawmakers last year requiring municipalities to submit their zoning amendments to the State Building Code Review Board for review.
“I would ask the committee to consider letting the legislation from last year play out before we go ahead and remove local authority to adopt local building codes,” Byrnes said.
A similar bill, Senate Bill 94, passed the Senate in March. Both bills forbid local building code amendments with slight variations. The House retained SB 94 in committee — which means it won’t advance to a floor vote for now — in hopes that language from both is merged into HB 428 and passed by the Senate.
A tight New Hampshire housing market
This comes after years of soaring housing prices in New Hampshire. The median home sale price in New Hampshire year-to-date was roughly $515,000 for single-family houses and $410,000 for condos, according to the New Hampshire Association of Realtors April report. That’s a 6.2% and 2.5% increase, respectively, from the same time last year, when the association reported an average sale price of $485,000 for single-family houses and $400,000 for condos. This exceeds the U.S. inflation rate, which was 2.3% for the year ending in April, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. In April 2015, the median sale price year-to-date was roughly $227,000 for single family houses and $161,500 for condos, according to the New Hampshire Association of Realtors.
Economists point to the low supply of housing in New Hampshire as a driver of rising prices. In April 2025, there were 1,614 single family houses and 624 condos for sale in New Hampshire, according to the Association of Realtors. That’s up from last year when there were 1,227 single family houses and 487 condos for sale, but it’s down substantially over the course of a decade. In April 2015, there were 10,319 single-family houses and 2,134 condos for sale.
Housing is a major issue for New Hampshire voters. A poll commissioned by advocacy group New Hampshire Housing Action found that 55% of respondents considered New Hampshire’s housing shortage the number one issue facing the state. That’s more than inflation, taxes, homelessness, health care costs, and immigration. Similarly, Gov. Kelly Ayotte as well as both Republicans and Democrats in the Legislature have highlighted it as one of the most pressing issues and vowed to address it.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/newhomezoning-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-14 06:00:52.660627

Once a little girl roaming the vibrant fields of an organic lettuce farm in Kealakekua, Hawai‘i, Ella Kilpatrick Kotner learned how to live in harmony with the land before most kids learn how to tie their shoes. Nourishing the soils that gave her a regular supply of leafy greens was just a part of life. As was playing with the piles of compost on her family’s farm.
“Composting, for me, is a lot about community,” said Kilpatrick Kotner. “It’s about connecting people to food and soil, and it’s about learning and being engaged in the process, and meeting your neighbors, and treating this thing that many people think of as a waste as a resource to be cherished and handled with care and turned into something beautiful that we can then reuse to grow more food.”
She now leads a program at Groundwork RI, a nonprofit in Providence, Rhode Island, that does just that.
Every day, her team of three bikes throughout the city, collecting food scraps from hundreds of households, which are then brought to a community garden. There, they mix pounds of nitrogen-rich food scraps otherwise destined for landfills with carbon-rich materials, such as dry leaves and wood shavings, while sifting out pieces of plastic and even the occasional fork. In doing so, Kilpatrick Kotner is creating a menu and a habitat for the microbes that prompt the decomposition process, transforming the waste into a spongy source of life for the soil. The compost is then made available to those enrolled in the subscription-based service to use in home gardens, yards, or urban farms.
The U.S. wastes over one-third of its food supply, which contributes considerably to global greenhouse gas emissions, primarily as a result of the methane that is released when food decomposes in landfills. A decade ago, the Obama administration set a national target to cut the nation’s food waste in half by 2030. Many observers expected the first Trump administration to ignore that goal because of the implicit climate focus, so it came as a surprise when Trump doubled down on the benchmark.
Not only did Trump officials participate in the 2018 U.S. Food Waste Summit, but his first administration also launched the first interagency agreement to reduce food loss and waste. That involved formal commitments to the 50% food waste reduction goal from the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Agriculture, and the Food and Drug Administration.
Without any federal enforcement mechanism, though, that ambitious goal has remained out of reach. Americans still waste about 300 pounds of food per person each year, roughly as much food as they did almost a decade ago. Trump’s reasoning, anyway, had more to do with protecting economic gains — food waste costs the U.S. hundreds of billions every year — than climate benefits.

In 2023, the EPA launched the Community Change Grants Program, a congressionally authorized program to support community-based organizations addressing environmental justice challenges, which funneled in about $2 billion of funding from the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA. In December, Groundwork RI was one of nine organizations included in an $18.7 million community change grant awarded to the Rhode Island Food Policy Council. A portion of the three-year funding stream was intended to provide the nonprofit with the resources needed to expand its collection service to neighboring cities, build a bigger compost hub, renovate their greenhouse with its pay-what-you-can farmstand, and add composting bin systems to more local community gardens. It also would have made it possible for Kilpatrick Kotner’s team to launch a free food-scrap collection pilot with the city of Providence.
Now, in his second term, President Trump has made no secret of the fact that his administration is working to unravel climate action and justice-oriented programs across the government — and make it harder for state initiatives to pick up the slack.
On May 1, after months of the Trump funding freeze uncertainty, the partners involved in the Rhode Island food-waste project learned that the $18 million grant was terminated. The EPA’s official notice, shared with Grist, informed the grantees that their project was “no longer consistent” with the federal agency’s funding priorities and therefore nullified “effective immediately.”
Zealan Hoover, a former senior adviser to President Joe Biden’s EPA Administrator Michael Regan, doesn’t believe that Trump is specifically targeting food-waste initiatives, but rather environmental justice programs in their entirety.
“It’s clear to me, from the terminations that have been going out, from the statements that have been made, in court filings, and to the press, that EPA is in the process of sending termination notices to every grantee in the Office of Environmental Justice,” said Hoover, who led the agency’s implementation of the bipartisan infrastructure law.
He noted that he believes the move to be “unlawful” as the IRA funding was allocated by Congress.
“As with any change in administration, EPA has been reviewing all of its grant programs and awarded grants to ensure each is an appropriate use of taxpayer dollars and to understand how those programs align with administration priorities,” an EPA spokesperson told Grist. “Maybe the Biden-Harris administration shouldn’t have forced their radical agenda of wasteful DEI programs and ‘environmental justice’ preferencing on the EPA’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment.” The spokesperson did not respond to Grist’s request for clarification about the agency’s legal authority to cancel the congressionally authorized community change grant.
Michelle Roos, executive director at the Environmental Protection Network, which is a national volunteer network of former EPA staffers, told Grist that around 400 grantees have now had their contracts terminated. The number of grants targeted was first released by the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works at the end of March. A recently filed court document revealed the EPA is planning to terminate 781 grants in total.
According to Hoover, in prior administrations, it was “exceedingly rare” for the EPA to terminate grants. “This is a huge break from precedent that is pulling the rug out from underneath local communities,” he said.
Nessa Richman, executive director of the Rhode Island Food Policy Council, also questions how the administration can end the $18 million community change grant. The lead-up to the project took more than a year to develop and had garnered support from several state departments and the Department of the Navy. “It is a sinking feeling,” said Richman, “that this opportunity that we, and our partners, had worked so hard for, and that our state was so ready for, is slipping away.”
The money was set to create 27 new local jobs, provide food scrap pickup for more than 15,000 households, build 37 food scrap drop-off locations across Rhode Island, and develop nine compost processing facilities, including a larger-scale one on land owned by the naval station. What’s more, it would have launched a local supply chain for redirecting excess food from institutions like schools and restaurants to food-insecure community members instead of landfills. And it would have made Groundwork RI’s pickup collection model freely accessible to the community members they serve — not just to help fight food waste, but to also learn how to take better care of the soil as they grow their own food.
“It’s easier for folks who have a little bit of disposable income to buy that countertop composting food scrap collector, or that 5-gallon bucket, and buy a service that comes and picks up their food waste at their door. It’s easier for them than for people who are working three jobs to make ends meet to take the time to separate out that food waste,” said Richman. “The loss of the funding, in a real way, doesn’t just slow down the reduction of the food waste, but it further establishes a divide.”
Richman estimates that at the end of the three years, the project would have diverted over 11,000 tons of food waste from landfill, which in turn would have prevented more than 15,000 metric tons of emissions.
Hours after she read the notification of their grant termination, Richman met an old colleague at a local coffee shop in Rhode Island’s East Greenwich. It had been many years since they’d seen each other, and the two sat together, catching up until the shop closed.
As they talked for a while longer in the parking lot, Richman watched in frustration as one of the coffee shop’s employees carried two bags of perfectly edible pastries and threw them in the dumpster.

Ohio House Bill 2, proposed legislation that creates a cost-sharing model for child care, passed the House Children and Human Services Committee on Tuesday, moving the measure for possible full House vote.
The language of the bill is the same as language included in the House version of the budget, passed last month. That budget proposal is still awaiting final approval, as the Senate works on its own draft before the two chambers come together to reconcile their drafts and create a final draft to send to the governor by the end of June.
House Bill 2 would cap child care assistance at 400% of the federal poverty level. The cost-sharing model in the bill would split the cost between the employer, employee, and the state, after an employer applies for the financial assistance. The state would put in 20% of the cost, and the employer and employee would each pay 40%, according to the bill.
Child care providers are not required to be a part of Step Up to Quality, the state’s child care and early learning provider rating system, under the bill.

The bill was passed 12 to 1, with only state Rep. Sarah Fowler Arthur, R-Ashtabula, voting against it.
“I do still have some significant concerns with the fact we incentivized, through Step Up to Quality, a number of providers to not be providers for the last period of time,” she told the committee.
She added that she stood against the bill “because I have concerns about the state subsidizing child care going forward.”
Fellow Republican state Rep. Tracy Richardson, of Marysville, voted in favor of the bill, but looked to the future of the measure and the language in the budget for needed changes.
“I will support the bill, but I want to publicly state that I believe that our finance committee may have some work to do on this bill, maybe look at perhaps some potential reduction in overall funding,” Richardson said.
She said the same thing about a second bill passed by the committee on Tuesday, a bill which would appropriate $10.25 million each for the next two years for grants aimed at expanding “child care capacity” and establishing an employer-based child care learning lab, among other resources for grant applicants.
Ohio House Bill 41 would require the Ohio Department of Children and Youth to oversee a grant program “to assist employers in retrofitting or equipping their onsite or near-site child care facilities, in building new child care facilities, or in partnering with child care providers, government entities, nonprofit organizations or others on initiatives to create child care capacity within their communities to support the workforce,” according to an analysis of the bill by the Legislative Service Commission.
“I see this being a potential, really strong pilot program, providing dollars necessary for those facilities that matter, particularly in areas where we are most impoverished,” Richardson told the committee before voting in favor of the bill. “I do think, fiscally, our finance committee should take a closer look at the overall appropriation.”
Fowler Arthur voted against the bill, along with Rep. Gary Click, R-Vickery, but neither made statements as to why they were voting against the second child care measure.

In recent years, the conversation surrounding mental health has gained much-needed momentum. Yet within this broad discussion, maternal mental health remains an area that is often overlooked.
As a family medicine physician, I’ve witnessed firsthand the challenges that mothers and families experience in the face of poor maternal mental health. It’s essential that we prioritize maternal mental health resources to foster healthier families and communities. 
The journey of motherhood is often portrayed as a time of immense joy, but it is important to acknowledge the concurrent challenges. Pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period can bring about significant physical, emotional, and psychological changes. Unfortunately, many women experience mental health issues during this time including anxiety, depression, and postpartum mood disorders. 
In New Hampshire it is estimated that approximately 1 in 8 women experience significant symptoms of postpartum depression or anxiety. Despite these numbers, many mothers suffer in silence, often due to stigma or a lack of resources. The consequences of untreated maternal mental health issues can be severe; a study published in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry found approximately 5% of all mothers in the 9-12 month postpartum period commit suicide and less than 40% of these women sought professional help prior to their suicide attempt. 
This turmoil affects not only the mother’s well-being but also the child’s development and the family’s overall dynamic. 
Another study published in JAMA Psychiatry found that untreated maternal depression is linked to adverse child outcomes, including behavioral problems and developmental delays. The risk of developing behavioral problems in children can increase by approximately 20-50% when maternal depression is present. These issues can manifest as conduct disorders, hyperactivity, or social difficulties. 
The likelihood of developmental delays, particularly in areas such as language and cognitive skills, can increase by about 30-40% in children whose mothers experience untreated depression. Children are also more likely to experience emotional problems, such as anxiety and depression, with estimates suggesting a 20-30% increase in risk. Social interactions and peer relationships can also be adversely affected.
Addressing maternal mental health can significantly reduce these adverse outcomes. For instance, interventions that effectively treat maternal depression have been shown to reduce the risk of behavioral problems in children by up to 40% and improve cognitive development significantly. Moreover, addressing maternal mental health concerns can enhance the overall emotional and social development of children, leading to better long-term outcomes.
In response to these pressing issues, New Hampshire has taken significant legislative steps to address maternal mental health through initiatives like Senate Bill 246, also known as the “Momnibus 2.0.” This bill aims to improve access to mental health resources for mothers by enhancing screening, education, and support services within the state. By mandating that health care providers offer screening for postpartum depression and related conditions, SB 246 represents a critical step forward in ensuring that mothers receive the care and support they need during this vulnerable period. Additionally, the bill promotes the development of community-based programs and resources, recognizing the importance of local support networks in addressing maternal mental health.
Investing in maternal mental health resources is not only a compassionate approach but also a practical one. Early intervention and support can prevent the escalation of mental health issues, reducing the long-term burden on health care systems. Programs that provide education, screening, and treatment for maternal mental health should be integral components of prenatal and postnatal care.
Community-based programs and support networks play a critical role in this effort. Establishing peer support groups, offering parenting classes, and creating safe spaces for mothers to share their experiences can help reduce feelings of isolation and empower women to seek help.
Health care providers, policymakers, and communities must work together to destigmatize maternal mental health issues and ensure access to necessary resources. With the approval of this bill as part of the state budget, we not only support mothers but also invest in the future well-being of our society.
The importance of maternal mental health cannot be overstated. As we continue to advance our understanding and support of mental health more broadly, let us not forget the unique challenges faced by mothers.
By prioritizing maternal mental health resources, we pave the way for healthier families and a brighter future for all.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/depressed-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-14 05:01:07.171223

Ohio House Reps. Sean Patrick Brennan, D-Parma, and Jim Hoops, R-Napoleon, introduced Enact the Hunger Free Campus Act earlier this year and it had sponsor testimony Tuesday in the Ohio House Workforce and Higher Education Committee meeting. 
Ohio House Bill 157 would require the Chancellor of Higher Education to create the Hunger-Free Campus Grant Program and award hunger-free campus grants which could, for example, create an on-campus food pantry or a partnership with a local bank, provide students information about SNAP, have an emergency assistance grant available to students, or have a student meal plan credit donation program.

“A Hunger Free Campus program addresses these challenges directly by providing accessible resources and support systems tailored to meet students’ nutritional needs free from stigma,” Brennan said. “Such initiatives ensure that no student has to choose between paying the electric bill or buying textbooks or groceries, allowing them to concentrate fully on their education.”
H.B. 157 would appropriate $625,000 for fiscal year 2026 and 2027 for the program. 
Some universities across the state have a food pantry on campus for students, but how they operate varies, Brennan said. 
“There is not consistency on where the pantries live, the size, what is offered, what department they are under, and what you have to prove in order to utilize them,” he said. “Sometimes it’s a single staff member going to the local grocer on their day off to buy things for the pantry.” 
Food insecurity is often an overlooked issue that affects many college students, Brennan said. 
“Rising costs are making it tougher for students to find sustainable and affordable food options, especially for the growing number of non-traditional students with children,” he said.  
Food insecurity is an issue that goes beyond hunger, Brennan said. 
About 23% of college students experienced food insecurity in 2020 and 59% of food-insecure students potentially eligible for SNAP did not report receiving benefits, according to a report released last summer by the U.S. Government Accountability Office. 
A survey conducted last year at Ohio State University showed that nearly one out of every three Ohio State students is food insecure, according to the student newspaper The Lantern.  
Food insecurity means a household has limited or uncertain access to enough food to meet their needs, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
“It affects students’ academic performance, mental health, and overall well-being,” Brennan said. “When students are unsure where their next meal will come from, they struggle to focus in class, perform poorly on exams, and are more likely to drop out.” 
Similar legislation has passed in California, Washington, Oklahoma, Illinois, Louisiana, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Massachusetts. 
“This bill will place Ohio at the forefront of tackling food insecurity in America and serve once again as a beacon by which more states will soon emulate,” Hoops said.  
Brennan introduced a similar bill in the previous general assembly, but it only had sponsor testimony. 
Members of the committee had positive things to say about H.B. 157. 
“I remember working in college full-time, but still it was difficult to afford food alongside my medicine, and so this is, no doubt, hopefully passes and will support a lot of students,” said state Rep. Munira Abdullahi, D-Columbus. 
State Rep. Beryl Brown Piccolantonio, D-Gahanna, asked Brennan and Hoops about the importance of students being nourished in order to learn.  
“If you don’t have a full belly, the last thing you’re thinking about is loading the three branches of government,” Brennan said. “The same would be true for anyone, for that matter, whether you’re an elementary school kid, a middle school, a high school, or in our higher ed classrooms.” 
State Rep. Kevin Ritter, R-Marietta, asked where the line is? 
“Just because we can do it, should we do it?” he asked. 
Brennan responded by saying he views this bill as an investment in young people. 
“When we invest in people that are hard-working and want to move ahead and climb that socioeconomic ladder, it’s going to save us in the long run,” he said.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)In May 1993, Kansas Sen. Bob Dole addressed the annual public radio conference at an early morning session, introduced as “one of the toughest critics of public broadcasting.”
Saying he shouldn’t be thought of as an enemy, Dole then gave the crowd a dose of the sardonic wit for which he was well known: “I’ve already had breakfast. And by the way, Big Bird never tasted better.”
When he ran for president three years later, Dole’s campaign issued a position paper including his stance on public broadcasting: Dole “opposed the establishment of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting as well as the National Endowment for the Arts and Humanities and supports their elimination.”
Although he didn’t succeed in his presidential bid, Dole’s position was perfectly in line with the Republican Party.
“Every Republican President since Richard Nixon has tried to strip the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) of taxpayer funding.”
That quote comes from the “Mandate for Leadership: The Conservative Promise,” also known as Project 2025. It calls for the elimination of this “tyrannical situation” in which “PBS and NPR do not even bother to run programming that would attract conservatives.”
Project 2025 calls for “the 47th President” to use their bully pulpit to persuade Congress — especially members of their own party — to support the total elimination of funding for public broadcasting: “CPB receives advance appropriations that provide them with funding two years ahead of time, which insulates the agency from Congress’s power of the purse and oversight. This special budgetary treatment is unjustified and should be ended.”
To be clear, CPB is not a government agency. It’s a private, nonprofit corporation created by an act of Congress in 1967 during the administration of President Lyndon B. Johnson. The advance funding approach is intended to insulate public broadcasters from partisan politics.
It’s not surprising that President Donald Trump would follow through on Project 2025’s plan to eliminate funding from the budget, but as with many other actions he has taken recently, he chose to issue an executive order to accomplish the goal expeditiously. His order gives the CPB board until the end of June to revise its community service grants in a way that would “prohibit direct or indirect funding of NPR and PBS,” contending that “neither entity presents a fair, accurate, or unbiased portrayal of current events to taxpaying citizens.”
Signed May 1, the order “Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Biased Media” also calls for the immediate cancellation of funding, ignoring the advanced funding formula intended to shield public media from political pressures.
The leaders of PBS (the Public Broadcasting Service) and NPR (National Public Radio) were quick to respond.
Katharine Meyer, NPR president and CEO, issued a statement the next morning: “The President’s order is an affront to the First Amendment rights of NPR and locally owned and operated stations throughout America to produce and air programming that meets the needs of their communities.”
Her counterpart at PBS, Paula Kerger, released a more terse statement referring to it as a “blatantly unlawful Executive Order, issued in the middle of the night.” She noted that PBS is exploring all options to continue with its mission.
While challenges to this executive order, which may well be overruled by the courts, are playing out, managers of local public broadcasting stations must consider how to deal with the potential loss of revenue. Stations receive grants directly from CPB and pass much of the money along to PBS and NPR to cover the cost of the national programming as well as to cover the cost of local productions and broadcast transmissions.
In a letter addressed to listeners of Kansas Public Radio, based at the University of Kansas in Lawrence, director Feloniz Lovato-Winston notes that federal funding amounts to 10% of the station’s budget.
“Critical funding for Kansas Public Radio is just steps away from being eliminated,” she writes, “and could result in a loss of approximately $244,000 per year.”
At KTWU, the PBS station licensed to Washburn University in Topeka, that figure is significantly higher at approximately $865,000, which is about 30% of the station’s budget, according to general manager Val VanDerSluis.
Stations in western Kansas, located in a less densely populated region, face even more challenging circumstances. From her office in Bunker Hill, Betsy Schwien, general manager of Smoky Hills PBS, which serves western Kansas, reports that federal funding accounts for about 48-49% of its annual budget.
At High Plains Public Radio, with offices in Garden City and Amarillo, Texas, the current annual operating grant of $222,000 from CPB amounts to about 15% of its annual budget.
“Without this funding,” says executive director Quentin Hope, “HPPR would be hard pressed to continue its current levels of service, including operating transmitters reaching the most rural areas of the High Plains.”
Such broadcasts to rural areas in Kansas can be traced to the early 1920s, when professors from Kansas State Agricultural College (now Kansas State University) drove over to Milford to present lectures on KFKB, a radio station operated by “the Goat Gland Doctor” — J.R. Brinkley. In 1924, K-State launched its own station, KSAC, broadcasting educational programming to listeners across Kansas and beyond.
When the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967 was taking shape, the general manager of KSAC, Jack Burke, served as chairman of the National Association of Educational Broadcasters. He played a key role in a lobbying effort to include radio in the legislation in addition to TV.
Ralph Titus, an announcer for KSAC (later identified as KKSU), joined the committee that determined how NPR would function. When the first edition of “All Things Considered” premiered on NPR in 1971, Titus was on air locally to welcome it. A timeline of KSAC’s history credits the station with providing more stories than any other in the nation during NPR’s first decade.
I should note that I used to be employed by public broadcasting in Kansas, serving as a producer and host of the “Sunflower Journeys” series as well as producing documentaries (like “Goat Gland Doctor,” narrated by Titus) and community affairs programs. I still produce documentaries that appear on public television occasionally, but I left my position at KTWU 10 years ago this month to return to my roots as an independent producer.
The effort to defund public broadcasting seems particularly alarming and sinister to me, as does the elimination of funding for institutions such as the National Endowment for the Humanities and the National Endowment for the Arts, not to mention other draconian cuts that have been made in the name of “government efficiency.”
It raises serious questions about the objectives of those initiating these actions. Is this really only a matter of conservatives following through with their vision of America and making good on their promises to restore “family values” and the like?
Trump has denigrated and demonized journalists since he began campaigning, calling us “enemies of the people” and speaking of “witch hunts” and “fake news.” His executive order related to public broadcasting must be viewed in the broader context of his attacks on other media outlets, all of which suggests he’s following an “authoritarian playbook” to circumvent the Constitution and the safeguards built in to our system of democracy.
Will our congressional representatives take any actions to protect us? It doesn’t look very likely.
However, I did come across a series called “The Open Mind” featuring an extended interview with Sen. Jerry Moran that was distributed to PBS stations across the nation last year. Following a conversation over lunch at a small cafe in Hays, the host travels with Moran to Plainville, the small town where he grew up.
The conversation continues as they walk through the stacks of the Plainville Memorial Library, where Moran recalls the time when he worked at the library as a teenager, helping organize its collection according to the Dewey Decimal System. He obviously has an appreciation for libraries, which makes one curious about how he felt when Trump issued the executive order directed at the federal agency that provides grants to libraries and museums: the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS).
I also wonder what he thinks about how the director of the Library of Congress, Carla Hayden — the first woman and person of color to lead the world’s largest library — was summarily dismissed for no apparent reason, leaving the impression that it most likely relates to the administration’s fervor in eliminating any ostensible DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) hires.
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt basically said as much: “There were quite concerning things she had done at the Library of Congress in pursuit of DEI.”
One of the recent additions to the vast archives of the Library of Congress during Hayden’s tenure did indeed have a considerable amount of content related to diversity and inclusion as well as equity. I can attest to that fact because I produced some of it.
In partnership with the American Archive of Public Broadcasting, the LOC has become a repository for selected locally produced programming. I received notification from Rochelle Miller, the archives project manager, last spring that our local series about Kansas history and culture has been included: “Early seasons of ‘Sunflower Journeys’ are now preserved and stored by the Library of Congress for future generations.”
I contacted Moran’s office in Washington, D.C., to ask about his response to the recent order involving public broadcasting. Although an aide indicated that I might expect to receive a response for this piece, I had yet to receive one Tuesday.
The same is true for an inquiry I made of my U.S. representative, Derek Schmidt, who continues to revel in what he sees as great accomplishments of Trump, whose “first 100 days have been success after success — and he’s just getting started.”
That assessment is listed on a special page of the White House website, along with those of most other Republicans in Congress, including Sen. Roger Marshall, who echoes Schmidt’s assessment: “The President’s first 100 days is a return to American greatness.”
Do you suppose they also agree with and support Trump’s characterization of those employed by PBS and NPR as he posted on his Truth Social platform?
“RADICAL LEFT ‘MONSTERS’ THAT SO BADLY HURT OUR COUNTRY!”
The only monster I’ve encountered in my years with public broadcasting is one who’s obsessed with cookies!

(Getty Images.)For nearly 60 years, Head Start has quietly done what so many government programs promise but few deliver: strengthen families, support work, and invest in children without expanding bureaucracy.
In every Ohio county, from our most rural hills to our busiest cities, Head Start helps families chart a better course. It ensures young children have a strong start in life and gives working parents the peace of mind they need to stay on the job, pursue education, and build economic security.
In today’s economy, where 72% of Ohio children under age six live in homes where all parents work, access to safe, reliable child care isn’t just a convenience — it’s a necessity. 
And for many low-income families, Head Start is the only option. Head Start accounts for one-third of publicly funded care in Ohio, and in rural counties, that increases to well over half of all publicly funded care. 
Any reduction or disruption would create child care deserts where working parents would face impossible choices: leaving the workforce, relying on unreliable care, or falling into deeper financial hardship. 
Protecting and expanding Head Start overall is thus not a narrow programmatic choice but a foundational investment in Ohio’s workforce stability, educational equity, and community resilience.
During the 2023–2024 program year, more than 31,000 Ohio children, including over 8,000 infants and toddlers, relied on Head Start. And behind those numbers are tens of thousands of working parents who were able to earn a paycheck, contribute to their communities, and set a stronger foundation for their families. 
That’s what Head Start really is: an economic engine as much as an educational and family empowerment one.
The program’s design reflects many of the values we hold dear in Ohio. Funding flows directly to local organizations, not federal agencies, so decisions are made by people who know their communities best. Local leaders assess needs, direct resources, and are held accountable for results. It’s government at its most responsive and efficient.
And the results speak for themselves. Children who participate in Head Start are more likely to graduate, more likely to avoid the criminal justice system, and less likely to rely on public assistance down the line, and the benefits carry on to the children of former Head Start students. 
That’s not just good for families — it’s good for taxpayers. For every $1 invested in Head Start, we see up to $9 in long-term returns. That’s not frivolous spending — it’s smart, conservative investing in Ohio’s future.
What’s at stake now isn’t just early education. It’s the stability of thousands of families and the workforce participation of parents across Ohio. Policy changes, regional office closures, and continued funding uncertainty threaten to destabilize the very systems that keep working families afloat, especially in communities where child care options are already limited.
We need Ohio’s congressional delegation to stand strong for Head Start, not as a partisan issue, but as a pro-family, pro-work investment that delivers real returns. This program is helping Ohioans do what they’re already trying to do: raise their children, work hard, and build a better life.
Our children and our economy deserve nothing less.

Local sheriffs are on the front lines in deciding whether to participate in the Trump administration’s mass deportation plans. But states increasingly are making the choice for them.
More and more, sheriffs’ hands are tied no matter whether they do — or don’t — want to help with deportations, though they often get the blame when conservatives draw up lists of sanctuary cities.
“‘Naughty lists,’ as we call them, are not super helpful here,” said Patrick Royal, a spokesperson for the National Sheriffs’ Association. “We all know there are places like Colorado where you can’t [help with deportations], and places like North Carolina where you have to.”
Cooperation between sheriffs and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement lies at the heart of the Trump administration’s immigration detention policy. The administration plans to punish noncooperative jurisdictions with funding cuts — though many legal experts agree that cooperation is voluntary unless state or local laws say otherwise.
Advocate: Ohio’s county jails are no place for migrants

Sheriffs, who typically run local jails, must decide what to do when faced with immigration detainers — requests from ICE to hold onto incarcerated people up to two extra days so ICE officers can show up and arrest them. ICE issues those detainers when the agency reviews fingerprints sent electronically for background checks as part of the jail booking process.
Otherwise, arrested suspects who post bond or are otherwise released by a judge might go free despite their immigration status, prompting ICE in some cases to pursue them in the community.
In North Carolina, Sheriff Garry McFadden ran on a platform of limiting cooperation with ICE  when he was elected in Mecklenburg County, home to Charlotte, in 2018. But today, McFadden must comply with detainers because of a state law passed last year.
In a now-retracted Facebook post, U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis in late April accused Mecklenburg and several other North Carolina counties of “shielding criminal illegal immigrants” as sanctuary jurisdictions. Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, said in the post he was writing federal legislation to prosecute sanctuary jurisdictions.
“You can’t say we’re a sanctuary county and have state laws that say we have to work with ICE. You can’t have both,” McFadden said. He added that he’d like more choice about whether to comply with detainers. A federal funding cutoff would endanger important jail programs such as rape counseling, he said.
“Everybody’s focused on immigration like that’s the biggest fire, and nobody wants to address the other things. The losers will be the prisoners who need all these services we provide,” McFadden said.










You can’t say we’re a sanctuary county and have state laws that say we have to work with ICE. You can’t have both.


– Sheriff Garry McFadden, Mecklenburg County, N.C.


Conservative sheriffs in Democratic-controlled states also can be frustrated by state policy on detainers. Sheriff Lew Evangelidis of Worcester County, Massachusetts, said he’s been criticized for releasing prisoners wanted by ICE but sometimes has no choice: A 2017 state Supreme Court ruling prohibits holding prisoners based on detainers.
“If they [ICE] want this person and consider them a threat to public safety, then I want that person out of my community. I want to keep my community safe,” said Evangelidis. He supported a Republican-sponsored effort in the state legislature to allow 12-hour holds for ICE if a judge determines the prisoner is a threat to public safety, but the amendment was voted down in April.
States act on detainers
Many experts agree that ICE detainers can be legally ignored if states allow sheriffs to do that.
“That detainer request is just that, a request, it’s not a requirement,” said Cassandra Charles, a staff attorney at the National Immigration Law Center, which is opposing Louisiana’s lawsuit to reverse a court-ordered ban on cooperation between Orleans Parish and ICE.
The general counsel for the North Carolina Sheriffs’ Association, Eddie Caldwell, agreed that the detainers are voluntary under federal law.
The association supports a state bill now under consideration that would require not only the 48-hour detention but also a notice sent 48 hours before release to let ICE know the clock is running. The proposal has passed the House.
The notification matters, Caldwell said, because there can be criminal proceedings that take weeks or months, so ICE in many cases doesn’t realize the 48-hour window has started.
Even sanctuary policies can’t stop ICE arrests

Tillis’ office said the senator’s disagreement with McFadden, a Democrat, and other sheriffs is about that notification.
“It’s not necessarily that [sheriffs] are breaking the law, but rather making it as difficult as possible for ICE to take prisoners into custody by refusing to do some basic things. Notification is important,” said Daniel Keylin, a senior adviser to Tillis.
States including California, Colorado and Massachusetts ban compliance with the ICE detainers, on the general principle that it’s not enough reason to hold people in jails when they’re otherwise free to go because of bail or an end to their criminal cases. Those three states have made recent moves to defend or fine-tune their rules.
California’s attorney general also has issued guidance to local jurisdictions based on a 2017 state law limiting cooperation with immigration authorities. That law withstood a court challenge under the first Trump administration.
Colorado has a law against holding prisoners more than six hours longer than required, and a new bill sent to Democratic Gov. Jared Polis last week would specify that even those six hours can’t be for the purpose of an immigration detainer.
Iowa, Tennessee and Texas are among the states requiring cooperation with detainers.
And Florida has gone further, requiring sheriffs to actively help ICE write detainers though official agreements in which local agencies sign up to help enforce immigration laws.
Cooperation boosts arrests
Such cooperation makes a big difference, experts say — jails are the easiest place to pick up immigrants for deportation, and when local sheriffs and police help out, there are more arrests.
“A larger share of ICE arrests and deportations are happening in places where local law enforcement is cooperative with ICE,” said Julia Gelatt, associate director for the Migration Policy Institute’s U.S. Immigration Policy Program, speaking at a recent webinar.
“A declining share of arrests and deportations are happening from places like California, where there are really strict limitations on local law enforcement’s cooperation with ICE,” she added.
ICE is making about 600 immigration arrests daily, twice the rate as during the last year of the Biden administration, said Muzaffar Chishti, an attorney and policy expert at the Migration Policy Institute, speaking at the same event.
Reports on deportations are incomplete, Chishti said, but he estimated the current administration is on track to deport half a million people this year and is trying to get that number higher.
“The Trump administration has not been able to change the laws that are on the books, because only Congress can do that,” Chishti said. “It’s going to take congressional action for the Trump administration to achieve its aim of higher [arrest and deportation] numbers.”
Here’s the latest on how states are cooperating with Trump’s deportation plans

President Donald Trump has added more pressure, last month requesting a list from Attorney General Pam Bondi and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem of sanctuary cities, which he says would face funding cuts. The administration also has sued some states, including Colorado, Illinois and New York, over their policies.
Asked for comment on the legality of funding cutoffs for sanctuary policies, Bondi’s office referred to a February memo in which she promised to “end funding to state and local jurisdictions that unlawfully interfere with federal law enforcement operations.” The memo cites a federal law saying local officials “may not prohibit, or in any way restrict” communication about immigration status.
Local jurisdictions in Connecticut, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon and Washington joined a February lawsuit led by the city and county of San Francisco and Santa Clara County in California against a Trump administration executive order calling for defunding cities with sanctuary policies, calling the order “illegal and authoritarian.”
In April, a U.S. district court in California issued a preliminary injunction in that case preventing any funding cutoff over sanctuary policies to the cities and counties in the lawsuit. And on Friday, the federal judge, William Orrick, ruled that the injunction applies to any list of sanctuary jurisdictions the administration may target for funding cuts.
Trump’s new executive order seeking the list cannot be used as “an end run” around Orrick’s injunction, the judge wrote, while he decides the legality of detainer policies and other issues.
“The litigation may not proceed with the coercive threat to end all federal funding hanging over the Cities and Counties’ heads like the sword of Damocles,” Orrick wrote.

(RUNSTUDIO/Getty Images)Finding ways to support older adults during trying times is not new. In 1965, Congress passed the Older Americans Act to complement the medical role of Medicare and Medicaid.
The challenges faced by older adults were increasingly clear, especially those with limited means. However, even those with means required support.
Recognizing the need to contract for services and oversee the delivery of programming led to the creation of 614 Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs) across the United States. The current system in Nebraska consists of eight AAAs serving urban and rural aging adults.
Stepping in
At the time AAAs came about in 1973, the 65-and-older population in the United States consisted of a little more than 20 million people. Today there are currently 58 million people who are 65 and older. By 2060, the projected number of older adults will reach 88 million.
The intent for AAAs is still focused on ensuring older adults with the greatest social and economic need can access services while living in the community. This is in addition to people seeking a sense of meaning and purpose. What we are discovering is older adults with and without means present with more unique and complicated needs.
What is the difference between aging adults then compared to today? More are living to 85 and beyond and doing so alone. While most older adults rate their health as good, there are others who face functional limitations and require extra help.
For those with family, caregivers are supported by AAAs through case management and related services. Yet not everyone has the family support they need to maintain their independence.
Filling the gap
The ability of Nebraska’s AAAs to fill in the gap for people without family or other sources of support is due to funding for such programs as the Older Americans Act, along with state and local sources.
To taxpayers, the question of whether these services matter is important to consider.
During 2024, Nebraska’s AAAs provided 1.4 million congregate (senior center) and home delivered meals to those ages 60 and older. They also provided $2.3 million worth of direct help including housekeeping, chore services and Lifeline support. For those needing coordination of services, 7,900 clients trying to stay in their home received case management services.
For older adults living in rural areas, AAAs can be lifesavers. Retirement communities, assisted living, and even nursing home care found in more urban areas are often a vanishing or non-existent commodity. Staying in the home is often their best and only bet when other options no longer exist.
Saving tax dollars
In addition to providing services, AAAs offer people seeking ways to give back an opportunity to find meaning and purpose while at the same time saving taxpayer dollars. In 2024, volunteers from ENOA delivered an impressive $2.6 million worth of support to the community.
Aging includes giving along with receiving care. And what may not be known is the role AAAs play during emergencies like global pandemics, power outages, and other life-changing events. They are the first to lend a hand and a meal to our aging neighbors to give them the support when needed most.
As the number of older adults increases, who will be there to provide support? A sluggish fertility rate has left fewer adult children to provide care to people as they age along with the closures of traditional sources of support in more rural areas.
In thinking about the future, if AAAs did not exist, there would be an ever greater need to create them to assist aging Nebraskans and their family caregivers. Support for these organizations and the people they serve is critical in 2025 and beyond.

Gavin Newsom says Donald Trump is a ""bully,"" but he's no stranger to using bullying tactics himself, especially to force local governments to obey his commands.","One of Gavin Newsom’s political ploys is to depict political rivals as bullies and himself as someone who stands up to them.
Last September, for example, he devoted an entire segment of his podcast, “Politickin’,” to denouncing Donald Trump, saying he is “a bully. But here’s the thing about bullies — they’re weak.”
That was before Trump was elected and before Newsom had to play nice in hopes of securing billions of dollars in federal relief aid for fire-damaged Los Angeles County. After initially saying he would provide such aid during a visit to L.A., Trump began hinting on imposing conditions on California, such as tightening up voting requirements and loosening up on water deliveries to farmers. 
Newsom then reverted to his previous role as a leader of resistance to Trump.
Yes, Trump does use bullying tactics to get his way. He uses aggressive policies — such as tariffs on imports — as a negotiating tactic. So does Newsom.
One example is the campaign his office is waging among the media to discredit USC Professor Michael Mische, who projected that as California loses in-state refinery capacity, gasoline prices could soar to more than $8 a gallon.
If Newsom believes that Mische is wrong, an effective response would be some research that proves it. But rather than refute Mische’s analysis, the administration has been planting suggestions that Mische is employed by Saudi Arabia, even though his advice to that nation ended years ago.
Newsom is never shy about forcing local governments to obey his demands, whether it’s making more land available for housing or being more aggressive about clearing encampments of homeless people. Newsom periodically threatens to withhold funds from or take legal action against cities and counties he deems to be negligent, emulating Trump’s tactics against states that won’t bend to his will.
It happened again this week when Newsom released $3.3 billion in bond money for housing and treatment of the mentally ill and homeless populations.

Homelessness 
Newsom wants cities to force homeless Californians to move camp every 3 days 

by Marisa Kendall 





“It is time to take back the streets,” Newsom said during a virtual press conference. “It’s time to take back the sidewalks. It’s time to take these encampments and provide alternatives and the state is giving you more resources than ever, and it’s time, I think, to just end the excuses.”
Newsom unveiled a model anti-camping ordinance he wants local officials to adopt and hinted that there would be consequences for those who balked.
“I’m not interested anymore, period full stop, in funding failure,” he said. “I want to see real results, and you’ll see in my budget on Wednesday that we’re going to hold that line.”
After receiving Newsom’s latest admonishment, local officials issued their latest defense.
Jeff Griffiths, Inyo County supervisor and president of the California State Association of Counties: “No, the state has not done everything it can to address homelessness in California. Without clear responsibilities for every level of government and reliable funding for cities and counties, successful local efforts will wither on the vine.”
League of California Cities executive director Carolyn Coleman: “When it comes to addressing homelessness, the question is not how many cities have encampment ordinances. It is whether cities have the ongoing funding from the state to match the scale of the crisis. Cal Cities stands strongly behind its position that now is the time for the state to invest in ongoing funding for all cities, big and small, to address homelessness.”
Bullying or political hardball? It’s difficult to discern the differences between Trump’s demands on states and Newsom’s on cities and counties. And if Trump’s bullying stems from weakness, what about Newsom’s?",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/092623_Newsom-Gun-Bill-Signing_MG_CM_17.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-14 04:03:29.993803

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderA three-judge federal court panel spent an hour in a downtown Atlanta courthouse Tuesday hearing arguments from attorneys about whether a conservative Texas organization’s mass voting challenges during a 2021 runoff violated the federal Voting Rights Act by intimidating minority voters.
Plaintiff Fair Fight Action, founded by Stacey Abrams, argued in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit that U.S. District Court Judge Steve C. Jones erred in ruling last year that True the Vote’s challenge to 365,000 Georgia voters’ eligibility did not constitute intimidation prior to historic Democratic Senate victories in Georgia when Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff prevailed in the Jan. 5, 2021 runoff.
At least one of the judges expressed skepticism about the soundness of the lower court ruling.
Mass voter challenges have been a mainstay in Georgia since the 2020 presidential election, when Democrat Joe Biden narrowly defeated Republican Donald Trump by about 12,000 votes in the state.
According to Fair Fight Action and others who filed suit, True the Vote’s actions likely violated the Voting Rights Act by using inaccurate voter registration information and voter intimidation tactics such as posting citizen watchdogs to monitor people casting ballots.
On Tuesday, the federal panel peppered the attorneys with questions while acknowledging the case’s national significance on voting rights protections.
Attorney Jake Evans, representing True the Vote, asserted that the intent behind the mass challenges was to protect election integrity.
Evans said that the mass challenging of voters’ eligibility prior to the 2021 runoff did not amount to voter intimidation.
Fair Fight’s attorney, Uzoma Nkwonta of the Elias Law Group, argued that although Jones acknowledged recklessness in his ruling, the district court erred in not following the generally accepted standard for taking a substantial step towards the course of action that led to the injury.
Nkwonta referenced the Muscogee County election board having to take up more than 4,000 challenged ballots from the 2020 November general election based on faulty national change of address data.
“Not only was it foreseeable, it’s exactly what True the Vote wished for and exactly what True the Vote demanded,” Nkwonta said. “True the Vote issued press releases, prepared one-pagers, considered suing counties and did everything in their power to force (Muscogee) County to take the very action that they took.”
“The voter intimidation statutes have been enforced since the 1960s and even earlier, and they often involve cases in which individuals were applying laws or taking actions that were permissible in every other scenario, but were impermissible because they were intimidating voters,” Nkwonta said.
Evans said that over the course of a seven-day trial the voters who testified did not provide proof of how they were intimidated by True the Vote. He argued the plaintiffs have failed to prove a violation of the Voting Rights Act.
“An attempted act has to be traceable to the alleged intimidation,” Evans said. “Here, there are three individual voters where there is no connection. There is no alleged challenger that’s submitted to challenge these individuals. It’s completely untraceable.”
Judge Federico Moreno said he disagreed with Evans stating it was an “open and shut appeal.”
“I don’t know about the substantive 11 B claims, but I think the district court committed legal error with regard to the attempt,” Moreno said, referencing a section of the act that bars voter intimidation. “Attempt is generally defined, both in civil and criminal law, as the intent to carry out an objective and taking a substantial means toward doing that.”
Moreno provided an anecdote about how a bank robber told a teller, “Give me the money in your drawer” before then being thwarted by a security officer.
“That person has attempted to commit bank robbery, even though he has not stolen the money because he was stopped by a third-party intermediary,” Moreno said.
In addition, Moreno questioned Evans about whether an organization that filed several hundred frivolous voter challenges could be considered an attempt to intimidate voters.
Evans said that True the Vote did not use tactics to intimidate voters like other cases where robocalls were used to threaten voters or Native Americans were targeted by sending people to follow them into polling places.
“Judge Jones looked at the evidence,” Evans said. “He evaluated the demeanor of the witnesses. He saw the witnesses testify, evaluated the totality of the evidence, and he made a factual finding in his order that said that there was no intent by True the Vote to intimidate any voter, any witness.”

“At a time when we see how our federal administration has stepped back from protecting our air and our water, Maryland is stepping up,” Moore said.
The governor also signed an abortion grant program that will help fund abortion services for uninsured and underinsured individuals, and a bill allowing individuals with autism and other nonapparent conditions to add an identifying symbol to their state IDs. That, and Tuesday saw the approval of a new state mineral, chromite, and a new state cocktail, the Orange Crush.
Chesapeake Bay Legacy Act
President Donald Trump (R) and his Department of Government Efficiency have already cut positions at the Chesapeake Bay Program, which administers the bay cleanup, as well as at agencies whose work touches the bay, such as the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. DOGE also threw environmental grant programs into chaos by freezing funds, some of which were later unlocked.
But advocates say Trump’s proposed “skinny” budget for fiscal 2026 would go considerably further, and “devastate” efforts to clean up the estuary, according to the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.
A ‘chrometastic’ finish for one state symbol bill

The bill would hack $5 billion from the EPA, including $2.46 billion in cuts that would “cripple” programs that help sewage treatment plants reduce pollution into waterways like the bay, according to CBF. Trump’s proposal would also slash $1.3 billion in grants and research programs at NOAA and $564 million at the U.S. Geological Survey, eliminating climate-related work to “focus on achieving dominance in energy and critical minerals.”
Allison Colden, the bay foundation’s Maryland executive director, said the federal losses make Maryland’s Bay Legacy law even more important.
“With federal cuts and rollbacks looming heavily on our state, Maryland’s environmental leadership is more important than ever,” Colden said in a statement. “This Act will help maintain forward momentum and ensure that investments in clean air, clean water, habitats, and local economies are secured.”
The new law came in a challenging budget year, during which lawmakers had to correct a multibillion-dollar deficit by cutting programs and raising fees.
As drafted, the bill would have allocated $2 million to the Leaders in Environmentally Engaged Farming, or LEEF, program, but budget-conscious lawmakers cut that to “up to $900,000” a year. The budget reconciliation process further reduced the sum to $500,000 for next fiscal year, with some of that money contingent on the Maryland Department of Agriculture submitting a plan for program spending.
“Unfortunately, we saw less coming out of the state budget for that program than maybe we would have liked to see,” Colden said. “But the point is, we have that program established. They have some initial seed funding.”
With funding and other incentives, Agriculture Secretary Kevin Atticks said the LEEF program will encourage farmers not only to pursue environmentally friendly practices, but to engage the community and share information about the practices with others.
“It incentivizes them in a way that we believe farmers and the community will rally behind and will make extra progress,” Atticks said.
As he signed the bill, Moore was backed by Nia Nyamweya, who brought a basket of leafy greens harvested from her Beauty Bloom Farms in Montgomery County. The produce and flower farm aims to regenerate the soils, formerly used for corn and soybean farming, with organic practices and cover cropping, according to its website.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Nyamweya leases her farm land from the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, Moore said. The bill codifies the practice in state law.
“That kind of partnership is rare, but the Bay Legacy Act will make these kinds of lease agreements easier,” Moore said.
The bill drew some early concerns for its massive scope, touching on everything from agricultural practices to a Japanese fish processing technique called ikejime. Delmarva Fisheries Association Chairman Robert Newberry called it “an ag bill with a side salad of fishery management and aquaculture.”
He initially balked at a provision that would have removed DNR’s obligation to produce its own fishery management plans for a variety of species, from white perch and blue crabs to croakers and horseshoe crabs, deferring to plans created by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission.
The final law requires DNR to keep producing state-level plans for blue crabs, oysters, white and yellow perch, and a few other species, but it lifts the requirement for others, such as menhaden, spot and black sea bass.
In the end, Newberry supported the Bay Legacy bill. In particular, he appreciated an amendment that added specificity to an existing law preventing discrimination against groups of fishermen, adding fishing guides and charter boat captains.
Newberry has been among a group of fisherman fighting rules from the Atlantic States Commission limiting charters to one rockfish per person, beginning last year.
“I wanted to have the fisheries specifically defined,” Newberry said. “So that protects us.”
Abortion grant program
Maryland will also have a new grant program that will help fund abortion services for uninsured and underinsured individuals using a stockpile of unused premium surcharges, now that Moore signed House Bill 930 and Senate Bill 848 into law.
State officials, advocates fear impact of expected Medicaid cuts in House bill

“Maryland will always be a safe haven for abortion access,” Moore said.
The legislation prompts the Department of Health to tap into about $25 million in premium surcharges that were required as part of the federal Affordable Care Act but have not yet been spent down.
That money is the $1-a-month fee that insurers in the ACA marketplace are required to collect on every policy to fund abortion services for their policyholders. But that fund has been growing by about $3 million annually as collections have outpaced need.
Moore said the legislation builds off previous efforts to expand abortion access in the state, calling it the “next chapter in our work to protect and defend basic health care rights.”
Eric’s ID
Moore also signed legislation known as “Eric’s ID Law” that will let people with nonapparent disabilities, including autism, have a butterfly icon added to their driver’s licenses, to alert police officers and other officials that they are interacting with someone with a disability that may not be immediately visible.
Lt. Gov Aruna Miller noted that the “thoughtful and compassionate initiative” was inspired by Eric Carpenter-Grantham, a 20-year-old Montgomery County resident with autism, one of the nonapparent disabilities identified in House Bill 707 and Senate Bill 618.
Eric’s Law has been in the works for several years, in collaboration with members of the disability community, finally receiving House and Senate approval this past session, Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) noted.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DSC_0197-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-14 01:58:00.264212

(Photo courtesy the Maryland Transportation Authority)Maryland went back to court against the Trump administration again Tuesday, saying an administration plan to withhold funds from states that do not comply with White House immigration policy amounts to a “grant-funding hostage scheme.”
Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown was one of 20 Democratic attorneys general who filed the lawsuits in U.S. District Court for Rhode Island against the departments of Transportation and Homeland Security.
Both suits say the administration does not have authority to withhold funds and that the lawsuits aim “to prevent the Trump Administration from trying to strong-arm them [states] into participating in federal immigration enforcement by threatening to cut off billions of dollars” in funding.
One suit names the U.S. Department of Transportation and Secretary Sean Duffy, and the other names the Coast Guard, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the U.S Department of Homeland Security and Secretary Kristi Noem.
Brown has already led or joined more than two dozen suits and amicus briefs since President Donald Trump was sworn into office Jan. 20. His office joined three last week along, including one that said the administration illegally withheld about $3 billion in previously approved funds for electric-vehicle infrastructure.
Trump orders list of ‘sanctuary cities’ to target for funding freeze

The suits filed Tuesday said Maryland received more than $42 million in federal money from FEMA last year, and that the state typically receives more than $1 billion a year in federal funding for transportation infrastructure, the state annually receives at least $1 billion.
“Our message on these lawsuits is straightforward: Maryland law, as passed by the General Assembly in 2021, clearly recognizes the federal government’s primary role in immigration enforcement while setting limits on state and local cooperation,” Brown said in a statement. “The Attorney General joined this action because the federal government is attempting to force Maryland to act against its own laws.”
On his first day in office Jan. 20, President Donald Trump (R) signed an executive order to direct the Homeland Security secretary go after so-called “sanctuary” cities and states that allegedly protect immigrants.
Administration officials were not backing down from those positions in the face of Tuesday’s lawsuits.
“The President has been clear on that,” Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs with Homeland Security, said in an emailed statement Tuesday. “Under Secretary Noem’s leadership, DHS is working to end violations of federal immigration law and remove criminal illegal aliens from American communities.”
McLaughlin continued: “Radical sanctuary politicians need to put the safety of the American people first—not criminal illegal aliens. The Trump Administration is committed to restoring the rule of law. No lawsuit, not this one or any other, is going to stop us from doing that.”
Duffy, in a prepared statement released by his office Tuesday, said the “20 states are challenging the terms of their grant agreements because their officials want to continue breaking Federal law and putting the needs of illegal aliens above their own citizens.”
“No funding has been withheld,” his statement said. “What my Department has done is remind grant recipients that by accepting federal funds, they are required to adhere to federal laws.
But Gov. Wes Moore (D) backed Brown on the lawsuits, and said the state will continue to defend itself against “any threat.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“By forcing states to divert limited resources from protecting local communities, we stand to compromise the significant progress we have made on public safety over the last several years — including some of the most impressive crime drops in the entire country,” Moore said.
“The bottom line is this: threatening our security and transportation funding creates unnecessary risks, makes us less able to respond to disasters, and makes us less safe,” he said.
The suit against Homeland Security claims it’s forcing states to use “scarce” law enforcement and other state resources to follow federal civil immigration enforcement.
The DOT suit cites an April 24 letter from Duffy that requires all federal funding recipients cooperate in enforcing federal immigration law.
The lawsuit said states “would be unable to obtain compensation for the harms they would suffer as a consequence of an abrupt and unlawful denial of funding. The unlawful condition also inflicts additional irreparable harm on the States by infringing their sovereign rights, damaging public trust, and harming public safety.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/13697971305_08ce56a830_o-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-14 00:59:11.711327

Wes Moore before the signing of a bill naming chromite the official state mineral. Byron's great-great-great-great-grandfather discovered the mineral in Baltimore County more than 200 years ago. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)A rainy Tuesday in Annapolis did little to dampen the spirits of 18-year-old David Shore. One might even say he had a “chrometastic” day.
Shore, the young mineral enthusiast who is known to sign emails “chrometastically yours,” traveled to the State House for the signing of a law designating chromite as the state’s official mineral, one of 171 measures signed into law Tuesday by Gov. Wes Moore (D).
“I’m elated,” Shore said moments before Moore signed the bill. “It took about half my life to get this bill through. I’m glad that a story of American success is being commemorated in Maryland with this bill.”
The ceremony brings to a close a nearly decade-long effort for Shore, who first testified in support of a similar bill in 2017.
Shore at the time was 10 and had his own lobbyist. Ashlie Bagwell, a lobbyist with Harris Jones & Malone, re-teamed with Shore and Sen. Craig Zucker (D-Montgomery), sponsor of the 2017 bill, for this year’s efforts. House Environment and Transportation Committee Chair Marc Korman (D-Montgomery) sponsored the House bill.
On Tuesday, Moore signed both the House bill, adding chromite to the official list of state symbols, and the Senate bill, which was amended to make Orange Crush the official state cocktail, along with chromite as the state mineral. The new law takes effect June 1.
“It was one of the bright spots of a tough session with everything that was going on at the federal level,” Zucker said of the bill’s passage. “It was a really hard session.”
When processed, chromite is a gritty, metallic charcoal-colored substance that is used in metal alloys, heat resistant materials and pigments. The mineral was first discovered in the Bare Hills area of Baltimore County in 1808 by Isaac Tyson Jr. Deposits were also found in Baltimore City and in Carroll, Cecil, Harford, Howard and Montgomery counties.
Tyson founded Baltimore Chrome Works. The plant was the first in the nation to manufacture chromium chemicals. The products were used in paints and in metal alloys including stainless steel.
The mineral was exported out of Fells Point. Deposits in the region produced most of the world supply of the mineral until the 1850s. South Africa is currently the world’s largest producer of the mineral.
Shore’s effort caught the attention of Tyson descendant Hannah Tyson Lee Byron, who attended the bill signing alongside Shore.
“I’m very proud of our Tyson family history, and to see my great-great-great-great-great-grandfather recognized for his discovery of chromite and the importance it played in Maryland and throughout the country and the world,” Byron said.
Chromite continues to be mined, though no longer in Maryland. But evidence of its past importance to the region remains in the names of many thoroughfares in Maryland,  like Chrome Road in Cecil County and Chrome Mine Road in Montgomery County. Abandoned mines can be found in some state parks including Soldiers Delight in Baltimore County.
Shore borrowed samples from Soldiers Delight Conservation Inc. to bring to the signing ceremony. Those samples get returned Wednesday, when the conservation group is scheduled to hold a small reception to congratulate Shore.

Chromite was not alone as it moved to the list of official state symbols.
Thanks to some 11th hour legislative shenanigans, the House tacked on the amendment to Zucker’s version of the bill that added Orange Crush as the official state cocktail. The language was not present in Korman’s bill, which passed earlier.
The cocktail was the subject of its own House and Senate bills that seemed destined for failure in the 2025 session. The late change is the latest volley in a squabble with Delaware over the origins of the drink.
The First State named the gin-based drink its official state cocktail last year despite its origins in the Free State.
Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) said the House and Senate “eventually … had a number of conversations about moving forward, about how can we make this session and find some things that everyone’s going to really be proud of and take back from Delaware what was rightfully ours from the beginning.”
Chromite and the Orange Crush will join 24 official state symbols. The list includes both a state sport and team sport, a state dinosaur, dog and cat, and crustacean, among others.
The last state symbol added was rye whiskey in 2023. It was the first time in 15 years that a new state symbol made the list. In 2008, the legislature approved an official state exercise (walking) and official dessert (the Smith Island cake).",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DSC_0393-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-14 01:58:00.264212

The best way to attract that investment, they say, is with a New Markets Tax Credit program.","With a shaky economy and uncertainty at the federal level, Tom Coale and Ryan Dressler argue that now is the time for the state to invest in a state-level New Markets Tax Credit program. (Photo by Angela Breck/Maryland Matters)Maryland is a state with great economic opportunity, but it is not equally distributed. From Baltimore’s disinvested neighborhoods to Western Maryland’s struggling small towns and the Eastern Shore’s underdeveloped commercial corridors, too many communities lack the resources and capital needed for sustainable economic growth.
In the context of fiscal headwinds and uncertainty with the federal workforce, now is the time for the state to invest in a state-level New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) program, modeled after the federal program. A $5 million annual investment each year for four years in the form of a tax credit (foregone tax revenue) — for a modest total of $20 million—would leverage significantly more private capital, spur job creation and provide a path forward for economic sustainability that is not dependent on federal spending.
The federal NMTC program was created in the year 2000 to encourage tens of billions of dollars of private investment in low-income communities. It provides tax credits to investors who fund projects in economically distressed areas, such as business expansions, mixed-use developments and community facilities. The program has a proven track record of attracting private investment, creating jobs and revitalizing neighborhoods, and is often the source of the first dollars invested in a redevelopment area.

From 2003-2023, the federal NMTC financed 115 projects in Maryland, creating 15,200 permanent full-time equivalent jobs. But even with this notable impact, Maryland is far behind its peers in utilizing the program.
Through fiscal 2023, Maryland was ranked 19th among the states in NMTC allocation invested in projects located within the state at $1.3 billion, far below neighboring Pennsylvania, ranked ninth at $2.6 billion.  Since 2007, 14 other states—including Ohio, Louisiana, Florida, Maine, Missouri, Illinois, and Nevada—have successfully implemented and renewed state NMTC programs. The federal program will award one of the largest amounts in program history in late 2025 – a full $10 billion of investment – but Maryland will need to develop a track record of success to compete.
Economic benefits of a Maryland NMTC program

Leveraging Private Investment: One of the most compelling reasons for Maryland to adopt a state NMTC program is its ability to attract private capital. Historically, every $1 of NMTC allocation generates $8 in private investment. This means that Maryland’s $5 million annual investment would yield $40 million of immediate program investment and encourage over $160 million of total private investment over the life of the program.
Revitalizing Maryland’s Most Distressed Communities: Many of Maryland’s struggling communities lack the infrastructure and commercial activity needed to drive economic growth. A state NMTC program would target investments in areas with high poverty rates, low median incomes and high unemployment, ensuring that resources reach those who need them most.


Baltimore City has numerous neighborhoods that would benefit from an infusion of investment to support small businesses, workforce development centers and community spaces.
Western Maryland, which has struggled with the decline of manufacturing and coal, could use NMTCs to fund tech hubs, tourism-related businesses and health care facilities.
The Eastern Shore, where agriculture and seafood industries remain dominant but undercapitalized, could see expanded processing facilities, cold storage infrastructure and commercial hubs.

These investments would not only stimulate business activity but also create jobs, improve property values, and enhance community services.

Job Creation and Workforce Development: The NMTC program has a strong track record of job creation. Projects funded by NMTCs often lead to construction jobs in the short term and permanent jobs in retail, manufacturing and services. For example, an investment in a new grocery store in a food desert would create construction jobs during development, retail jobs upon opening and supply chain jobs for distributors. A state-of-the-art vocational training center could train workers for high-demand industries such as health care, cybersecurity and clean energy, helping Marylanders gain skills and secure higher-paying jobs.

A Maryland NMTC could also be structured to small startups, and projects with strong community benefits, ensuring that economic growth is both inclusive and equitable.
Maryland has a choice: Continue relying solely on federal programs and risk losing out on critical investments, or take proactive steps to spur economic revitalization through a state New Markets Tax Credit program.  Time is of the essence to position Maryland to fully participate in the large allocation of federal New Markets Tax Credit spending later this year.
Maryland has long been a state of innovation and economic opportunity. A state NMTC program would reaffirm that commitment, ensuring that every community — urban, rural, and suburban — has the resources it needs to thrive.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/open-1.jpg,,,2025-05-14 00:59:11.711327

This call is in response to atrocities committed by Israel against the Palestinian people, in Gaza and the West Bank, during the past 19 months, and for decades prior. For over six decades, the U.S. has provided military aid totaling hundreds of billions of dollars (adjusted for inflation). This aid has supported Israel’s aggression against the Palestinian people and its seizing of their land and land from neighboring countries. 
The magnitude of attacks against Palestinian civilians since October 2023 has been determined to be genocide by Amnesty International and others, as well as ethnic cleansing. The U.S. has the moral obligation to stop providing aid to Israel in the form of military weapons and technology, and to support the rebuilding of Gaza’s infrastructure.
The ceasefire that began January 18 ended when Israel resumed military strikes in Gaza on March 18. It is essential that the U.S. use its considerable influence to ensure that a permanent ceasefire be established, which needs to include (as outlined by Jewish Voice for Peace): (1) withdrawal of Israeli military from Gaza, West Bank, Lebanon and Syria; (2) guaranteed unrestricted aid and reconstruction for Gaza; and (3) Israel being held accountable for its crimes against humanity.
Israel’s heightened military actions in Gaza during the past 19 months have created an outsized number of deaths and level of mass destruction. Israel has killed at least 50,000 Palestinians, the majority of whom were women and children. This is over 41 times the 1,200 deaths  reported to have been caused by the October 7 Hamas attack. While no number of civilian deaths is ever acceptable, this is an unfathomable ratio.
Since Israel ended the ceasefire on March 18, at least 673 Palestinians have been killed. In addition to those killed, there have been over 110,000 Palestinians wounded, approximately 90% of Gaza’s population displaced, and 69% of structures in Gaza damaged or destroyed. 
At least 169 journalists and media workers, and over 500 healthcare workers have been killed. The unprecedented and deliberate destruction of healthcare facilities, crops, livestock and water sources, and the obstruction of entry of humanitarian aid into the Gaza strip have led to extreme hunger and catastrophic spread of disease.
Compounding the horror that is occurring in Gaza, for the past 19 months, the Israeli government has supported increased Jewish settlements (held to be illegal under international law) in occupied Palestinian territory in the West Bank and ramped up violent repression of Palestinians living there, further destroying Palestinians’ ability to live peacefully.
Some hearing these numbers will say, “What about October 7, 2023? Isn’t this self-defense?” It’s true that Hamas and other armed factions attacked Israel that day, taking 241 captives and killing up to 1,200 people (mostly Israelis).  This act has been rightly condemned internationally.  However, the Israeli government’s extremely disproportionate response is clearly not justifiable as self-defense. It amounts to the annihilation of a people. Israel’s actions have been condemned as war crimes and crimes against humanity by the United Nations, the International Criminal Court, numerous humanitarian groups, and multiple countries worldwide.
While the October attack was not directly provoked by a single Israeli action, Palestinians have suffered much at the hands of the Israeli government prior to 2023. Since 1948, Israel’s policies – including massive seizures of Palestinian land and property, unlawful killings, forcible transfer, drastic movement restrictions, and the denial of citizenship and equal rights to Palestinians — are considered apartheid under international law according to Amnesty International  and others. For many years Gaza has been essentially an open-air prison.
The Northeast Connecticut Gaza Peace Group advocates for a permanent ceasefire, a ban on weapons and other military aid supplied by the U.S. to Israel, and the end of U.S. support for Israeli acts that the world recognizes as genocide, apartheid and ethnic cleansing. The U.S. must convey to Israel that military and colonial expansion into Palestinian territory is not acceptable. The proposed clearing of Palestinian people from Gaza coupled with taking over the Gazan waterfront for luxury real estate development is abhorrent. This greed-fueled ethnic cleansing must be rejected. 
Reconstruction of Gaza’s infrastructure will take many years and must be led by Palestinians. We believe that any solution to this crisis must be based on the commitment to secure the conditions for both Palestinians and Israelis to live with peace, dignity and justice.

They look at me, but I can’t help what I look like.  At times I have felt that I am living outside of my body. 
There is a stigma around my disease– that of being sloppy and unclean. It’s affected my mental health and I’ve suffered from depression, having withdrawn from society at times.  The medication should help. I’ve finally found a solution after years of suffering, but the cost is so high.  Is my condition obesity or eczema?  We could be talking about either one.  Medications for both are considered “vanity drugs,” but only one is covered by insurance without much fanfare.

Sarah Mackowicki
Medications related to both obesity and eczema are very expensive.  Both have injectable drugs that have been FDA approved in the last eight years along with older, cheaper, less effective alternatives. The only difference is that the drugs for one condition are much more expensive than the other. 
The injectable Dupixent, used for eczema, is almost three times as expensive as the weight loss GLP-1 Wegovy, with a list price of $47,916 a year compared to $16,188.  But Wegovy is the drug that is getting pushback from insurance companies who don’t want to cover the cost.  Yes, Wegovy is probably prescribed more than Dupixent, but the GLP-1 would have to be prescribed at three times the rate of Dupixent to even break even in cost.  So, why will insurance companies cover Dupixent and not cover Wegovy?  
Insurance companies not covering obesity medications is indicative of how society perceives obesity and the bias against the disease.
In a 2023 study, physicians were found to lack education around individuals who are obese, categorizing them as difficult and resulting in diminished patient care.  Patients who encountered weight bias from medical providers were more likely to report feelings of depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, and suicidal ideations.  Women report twice as many negative encounters with physicians as men and 40% of women who have a BMI over 35 report facing weight bias.  When insurance companies refuse to cover GLP-1 drugs they are advancing weight bias in the medical field.
In Connecticut, the Governor and the Department of Social Services (DSS) want to cut Medicaid coverage for GLP-1 drugs used strictly for weight loss, citing that the cost is beyond what the state can afford.  The message that they are sending to people who are obese is “we don’t care about your health; we only care about the money”.  Over the last couple of months, numerous GLP-1 users, including myself, have told their stories conveying just how life changing these drugs are.  GLP-1s for someone who has been obese their whole life could be the one treatment that helps them lose weight and keep it off.   As of June 15th, DSS has stated that they will no longer cover GLP-1 drugs that are used for strictly weight loss, perpetuating weight bias in their policies and going against current state law.
Connecticut legislators have already shown their support for the obesity community by passing PA 23-94 which supports Medicaid coverage for surgery and prescription drugs approved by the FDA for treatment of obesity.  During the 2025 legislative session, they have gone further with legislation to expand the definition of “weight loss drugs” to include GLP-1s approved by the FDA for weight loss (SB 1474).   
Support for these drugs will put pressure on insurance companies and DSS to cover these potentially lifesaving drugs, drugs that have been proven to be extremely effective for weight loss but also many other diseases including, Alzheimer’s, dementia, substance abuse, sleep apnea, fatty liver, Parkinson’s, PCOS, cardiovascular diseases, osteoarthritis, and is being studied in relation to many other diseases.  
Studies have shown that GLP-1s reduce inflammation in the brain and regulate anxiety as well as depression.  When insurance companies no longer cover GLP-1s, they are not only taking away medication that helps with weight loss they are taking away a drug that is helping that individual regulate their brain function.
The legislature along with DSS needs to prove to the obese community that they have their back.  This can be done by incorporating GLP-1s into the definition of “weight loss drugs” and continuing to find ways to fund this class of drugs.

But because it already plays a role in high-consequence decisions about lending, housing, criminal justice and employment, we need to treat it with the seriousness those areas deserve. That is why I support SB 2, Connecticut’s proposed legislation on artificial intelligence.
As someone who works in AI implementation every day, I see this bill as a practical framework. It creates space for responsible progress and positions Connecticut to lead on one of the most important technological shifts of this century.
SB 2 is designed for the U.S. business environment. It does not impose blanket rules. It focuses on high-risk AI systems, where harm is more than hypothetical. It includes phased implementation and flexibility for businesses to adapt.
The largest companies building AI already follow many of the best practices put forth by the bill. Microsoft, Google and Amazon conduct bias audits, risk analysis and impact assessments. These are not bureaucratic hurdles. They are common sense for any system making consequential decisions, and these measures can protect businesses from unforeseen complications.
Even OpenAI has called for clear standards. In their words, just as drivers are expected to follow common-sense rules to keep roads safe, developers have a responsibility to follow standards that keep the AI roads safe. That encourages investment, competition and greater freedom for everyone. Smart rules make it easier to build, test and launch better systems by setting clear boundaries.
EasieOps, for example, has helped clients reduce manual entry by up to 99 percent while improving accuracy and auditability. It is already reshaping how work gets done in compliance-heavy industries. AI tools are powerful and the future for them is bright, but as such, they must be handled with responsibility.
SB 2 also emphasizes transparency. When people engage with an AI system instead of a human, they should know. When a system helps decide whether someone gets a job, a loan or a criminal sentence, there should be a way to review what happened. This fosters trust and supports adoption and growth.
SB 2 rightly phases in requirements and supports education for small businesses. Small businesses typically automate internal tasks, not high-stakes decisions. Regulations should reflect that difference. A startup should not face the same reporting burdens as a multinational corporation.
Thresholds based on revenue or headcount, along with clearer definitions of high-risk AI, and carve-outs for low-impact systems could help refine the legislation to further meet its goals.
Free tools like IBM’s AI Fairness 360 toolkit, Canada’s Algorithmic Impact Assessment Framework and the Ontario Human Rights Commission’s AI assessment guide help small companies comply without legal teams. Policymakers should promote these resources.
The sponsors of SB 2 have built a framework grounded in how AI is actually used. Reasonable accountability that supports AI innovation is within reach. Artificial intelligence, combined with sensible guardrails, can foster the kind of innovation that solves problems, works across industries and builds trust along the way.
Smart regulation strikes the balance between social responsibility and innovation, and SB 2 does just that.

They elected Douglas County Treasurer John Ewing Jr., the Democrat in charge of the offices where people annually pay their car taxes in the Omaha area, who has pledged a City Hall focused on providing better basic city services.

He campaigned hard on the idea that Omaha could build better streets, hire more police officers to fight more types of crimes, work with neighborhood groups, nonprofits and others to fight root causes of crime and help all parts of the city grow.
“Tonight we embark on a new chapter,” Ewing said to a cheering crowd. “Together we will build an Omaha that offers opportunity for the ‘good life’ — to everyone.”
Moments before, as he launched his victory talk, he pointed out a pastor in the crowd who, along with another minister, told him about 13 years ago that he was going to be Omaha’s first Black mayor. 
“I didn’t know if I truly embraced it at that moment,” he said. “But they said that to me with such conviction, it stuck with me.”
Ewing said he couldn’t have done it without his wife, Viv. He introduced his family, including his brother, daughters and parents seated in the front. “Mom and Dad, I hope you’re proud.”
To his supporters, he said a few times throughout the night: “I promised you guys we weren’t going to be outworked.” 
Went Ewing’s way early
Election night was going Ewing’s way from the start. After the first wave of results were announced, he told the crowd that this was the best he’s felt in weeks, noting the exhaustion of the last laps of campaigning. After the second round of votes was announced, Ewing punched a fist in the air and Viv threw both arms up. His margin grew to nearly 11,000 votes by 10:15 p.m.

Democratic leaders past and present packed the downtown Omaha Hilton for the Ewing celebration, including former Gov. Ben Nelson, former Mayor Jim Suttle and former State Sen. Tony Vargas of Omaha.
Ewing, a former high-ranking police officer, is the first Democrat to serve as Omaha mayor since Suttle engineered a victory in 2009 and revived the city’s finances before losing to Stothert after raising a new restaurant tax. Registered Democrats outnumber Republicans in the City of Omaha by about 18,900 voters, according to the Douglas County Election Commission.
History made
Ewing also will become the first Black mayor of Omaha, having cleared the final hurdle that narrowly eluded former Democratic State Sen. Brenda Council of Omaha in 1997. She lost a close race to former Omaha Mayor and U.S. Rep. Hal Daub, R-Neb.
Ewing told the Examiner that since he became treasurer — and then became the first person of color in Nebraska to win a countywide election — he’d go into classrooms and say: “There’s nothing special about me.  What it means is that your dreams are possible, as well.”
“And that’s what I want them to see,” he said. 
Daub’s name was mentioned by many in the west Omaha crowd that gathered for Republicans on Tuesday night. Some had wondered whether Stothert, like Daub, might have overstayed her welcome despite having governed with significant popular support.
Voter fatigue?
Local political observers had predicted that Stothert’s biggest challenges were likely voter fatigue, unrest about the economy under President Donald Trump and the lack of a clearly articulated plan for a fourth term.

Stothert struck a proud and defiant tone in her concession speech, saying she leaves a city in much better shape than she found it. She has argued it has more money to repair roads, property tax rates that are lower and it is reviving the urban core with private donor partnerships.
“Tonight I’m very proud, grateful and hopeful. Proud of 12 years of success. I’m grateful for your support, your friendship and your trust. And I’m hopeful that the momentum we have created will continue,” Stothert said in a brief speech around 9:15 p.m.
She said she called Ewing and “congratulated him,” saying he is “inheriting tonight a great city.”
GOP soul-searching
Her supporters at Tuesday’s gathering at west Omaha’s A View on State included Gov. Jim Pillen and former Gov. Dave Heineman, along with former gubernatorial candidate Charles Herbster. 
Heineman, a longtime political activist before he ran, said Tuesday’s results show a changing Omaha, one that is increasingly Democratic-leaning in a ruby red Republican state.
“It’s been moving that way for some period of time,” he said. “The demographics of Omaha are changing.”
Pillen, who endorsed Stothert, said he was sad to lose conservative leadership in the state’s largest city. He said she had done a great job making the city one of the safest large cities in the country.
“That comes from leadership focused on what really matters,” Pillen said. “You know, as governor, I’m going to support the new mayor. That’s what we do in Nebraska. But yes, I’m disappointed. … I’m selfish. I wanted her for four more years.”
Race turned ugly late
Tuesday’s reflections were a marked change from the aggressive tone of the end of the race, which included attack ads on Ewing from the right about Democratic Party support for young people who are transgender and attack ads on Stothert from the left for the mayor backing Trump, whom she supported.

In an interview, Ewing said he thought Stothert’s attacks and “making things up” were desperate moves that hurt her. He said “people in this community … know me.” Stothert took no questions after her concession speech. But she has defended the attacks.
“This is not a national race where you can make up things and then people have to wonder if it’s true,” Ewing said. “They’ve seen what I’ve done in this city.”
This spring both candidates also lobbed back-and-forth attacks about each of their records. Stothert’s team criticized Ewing’s office for using a decades-old calculation for paying local school districts and governments that a state audit corrected.
Ewing’s team blamed Stothert for the city’s potholes, streets and inability to fill budgeted positions at the Omaha Police Department that Stothert added but sometimes struggled to fill with enough applicants to outpace retirements and departures.
Early voting mattered
Ewing’s campaign pressed its edge with early voting and door-to-door campaigning that showed up in Tuesday’s results when Ewing built an early 3,572-vote lead that the traditional GOP Election Day edge could not overcome. In fact, the gap widened in the second batch of results that included the first wave of Election Day votes, as well as the third.

On Tuesday night, Ewing repeated many of his goals, including improving public safety and adding to the city’s stock of affordable housing.
“To ensure that every Omahan has a place to call home,” he said.
Some Stothert supporters had wondered privately whether the mayor might suffer from people assuming she would win and not bothering to vote. With so-so turnout for an off-year city general election, enthusiasm proved a problem. County officials expect turnout to hit about 32%.
Ewing’s winning margin in the mayor’s race is likely to grow on Friday, when Douglas County Election Commissioner Brian Kruse’s office still has to count about 7,000 early voting ballots returned on Election Day. Those tend to come in as the early results do on Tuesday, which leaned toward Ewing.

Forrest Dunbar, D-Anchorage, speaks against a legislative citation for political writer Suzanne Downing on Tuesday, May 13, 2025. (Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Four days after the Alaska House of Representatives declined to honor conservative political writer Suzanne Downing with a legislative citation, the Alaska Senate narrowly voted to allow the citation to go forward.
Hours later, the House declined to reconsider its decision, effectively killing the citation.
Downing, the founder of the website Must Read Alaska, is a controversial figure in Alaska politics. A former newspaper journalist, she turned to conservative political writing in 2016 after serving as Gov. Sean Parnell’s speechwriter and communications director of the Alaska Republican Party.
It is extraordinarily unusual for the Legislature to deny a citation, which must be proposed by at least one of the Legislature’s 60 members. Downing’s was proposed by Reps. Jamie Allard, R-Eagle River, and George Rauscher, R-Sutton.
On Tuesday, Sen. Forrest Dunbar, D-Anchorage, asked to split Downing’s citation from a list awaiting senators that morning.
That vote would have been a first step toward tabling the citation, just as the House did. Instead, only eight senators joined Dunbar. Because 11 votes are needed to pass a motion in the Senate, Dunbar’s attempt failed, and the Senate approved the citation.
Dunbar said he believes the Senate’s vote against Downing’s citation failed because senators didn’t want to spend time debating it. If the House had approved the citation, he said that he believes the Senate would have voted it down instead.
Later in the day, members of the state House who support Downing attempted to bring her citation to a vote again. That procedural motion failed, with 21 votes against. 
Rep. Kevin McCabe, R-Big Lake, said he was disappointed by the failed vote.
“It’s really a shame that we couldn’t provide a citation for her,” he said.
Allard said she also was disappointed and felt that the vote was a little bit weaponized.
Afterward, Allard and Rep. Andrew Gray, D-Anchorage, had a heated argument in the House hallways about whether it was appropriate for Downing to repost a picture of Gray’s child that had been on social media.
Speaking on the House floor, McCabe said, “Was her writing always correct? Probably not … but I will say she is an amazing person, and most of all, that lady works from sunrise to sunset.”

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)As a nearly 50-year advocate for the Trans Alaska Gasline, many are asking for my assessment of the current status of the project. There is no doubt we have seen momentum rise and fall over several decades but right now momentum is clearly on the rise with President Trump once again focusing on Alaska’s project.
In 2017, I and two other governors were invited to the Oval Office for Energy Week to meet with President Trump and present our respective state’s most significant energy project. Following the meeting, President Trump took me aside and asked specifically what he could do to help advance Alaska’s gasline/liquefied natural gas project. I explained the need for Asian market customers.
A few weeks later we were informed that the president of China, on his return flight from meetings with President Trump at Mar-a-Lago, would be stopping in Anchorage to meet with me. China’s first lady and the majority of his cabinet would be accompanying him. China has long been Alaska’s largest trading partner so we honored the Trump administration’s request and met with President Xi and his delegation. Reporting on that meeting the ADN noted, “Alaska exported seafood, minerals, oil and other products valued at just under $1.2 billion to China in 2016.”  The article also confirmed that expansion of these exports was discussed as well as tourism, air cargo, and Alaska’s liquified natural gas export opportunities.
That momentum continued and as reported by the Juneau Empire by fall the Trump administration asked me, the only governor invited, to join his trade mission of 29 U.S. business leaders to China. After President Trump’s invitation for more meetings in D.C., I traveled with the president and his delegation on Air Force One from D.C. as far as Hawaii for meetings. I continued on to Beijing to meet up with my Alaska team before President Trump’s arrival in Beijing. This culminated in my signing a nonbinding customer gas off take agreement in Beijing witnessed by both President Trump and President Xi.
Directly following the Beijing signing ceremony, President Trump traveled on to Vietnam and along with Vietnam President Tran Dai Quang witnessed the Nov. 12, 2017, signing of the memorandum of understanding between Petro Vietnam Gas and then Alaska Gasline Development Corp. President Keith Meyer on behalf of AGDC. These very public signing ceremonies put the Alaska LNG project on the front page of nearly every LNG journal around the world.
After these signing ceremonies some of the world’s largest energy purchasers that had not already signed nonbinding letters of intent or memorandums of understanding to purchase LNG from Alaska soon signed up. These companies included among others: Tokyo Gas, Korea Gas Corporation, ENN Energy, Petro Vietnam Gas, Mitsubishi, Chuba Elec. Power (Japan) and Sinopec.  
Our team later successfully negotiated three truly historic gas purchase sales agreements with North Slope producers British Petroleum, ExxonMobil, and ConocoPhillips.
Unfortunately, all of this momentum faded following the 2018 gubernatorial election. The market customers that were once interested in Alaska moved on to other projects in Canada and the Lower 48 and the gas purchase sales agreements with the North Slope producers expired. Nonetheless, it is a fitting example of what project momentum can do, especially with the backing of the president of the United States.
What is often missed in the Trans Alaska Gasline project discussion is the financial benefit of Alaska’s close proximity to the Asian markets. This has been explained by the AGDC from the time of its creation in 2014 to today. Yes, many Lower 48 projects don’t require a new 800-mile gasline. However, the financial advantage of five to six days of shipping time from Alaska to the Asian market as opposed to the monthlong transits of LNG shipping from the Gulf Coast, plus the cost and uncertainty of going through the Panama Canal, must be considered.  
In 2023, while in Panama, I witnessed a long line of vessels, including LNG tankers, waiting to transit the canal. With low water, the transit was severely backed up and delayed. An auction was conducted for ships competing to move to the front of the line. One Japanese company paid $4 million above the normal transit fee to move up in the line. From Alaska it is a direct shot to Asia, a route that LNG ships used for over 40 years of on-time deliveries from Nikiski on the Kenai Peninsula.
The then president of Tokyo Gas, Japan’s largest buyer of LNG, Mr. Michiko Hirose, with whom I had met many times over the years, accepted my invitation to come to Juneau in 2018. His wife and senior advisors accompanied him and we held many meetings on Alaska’s LNG project over the course of a week. I asked Mr. Hirose about the importance of LNG price versus deliverability. He responded that price is very important but deliverability is crucial. If the best-priced LNG in the world does not show up on time, that is a huge problem for the utilities in Japan. 
This project has been delayed for so long that given the looming shortage of gas in Cook Inlet, Alaskan consumers have now become the market. Financial analysis shows that the pipeline alone can be financed, without the high compression/LNG component, to deliver gas to Alaskans at prices competitive with the cost of importing gas. Ultimately however, it is the LNG export piece that significantly reduces the cost of energy to Alaskans.
I do commend and support Governor Dunleavy’s working closely with President Trump to regain momentum for this critical energy opportunity for Alaska and beyond. It is imperative that this momentum continues to build and timelines for the start of construction and completion and first gas are met. Having the president of the United States and his administration strongly advocating for Alaska’s project could finally be the direly needed game changer to push it over the finish line.

Allbright announced his victory via social media.
“I am deeply honored by the trust voters in District 11 have placed in me,” Allbright said in a press release. “I’m ready to fight for our families, schools, and businesses, ensuring our community thrives while preserving the values that make Blount and Cullman Counties home.”
A message seeking comment from Allbright was left Tuesday evening.
Allbright campaigned on conservative Christian values and supporting local education. He said in an interview on May 1 that he supports the CHOOSE and RAISE acts because they bring local control to parents. 
According to campaign finance records, Allbright raised $118,000 and spent $62,185. The Alabama House Majority Political Action Committee (PAC) donated $5,000 to Allbright’s campaign, as well as many other PACs.
A message seeking comment from Fallin was left Tuesday night.
Allbright will still face Democratic candidate Alex Braswell on Aug. 26. Braswell, a 30-year-old American Sign Language interpreter, said Tuesday night she looks forward to a clean, concise general election in August. 
“I wish Heath the best going forward,” she said. “I won’t say no to any debates until the election.”
The seat became open after former Rep. Randall Shedd, R-Fairview, resigned in February to take a job with Senate President Pro Tem Garlan Gudger, R-Cullman. The district is solidly Republican. Shedd, who won the seat in a special election in 2013, never faced opposition in any subsequent general election.

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — State lawmakers advanced a proposal Tuesday adding new restrictions to a paid sick leave law Nebraska voters approved last year and which has yet to be implemented, moving the proposed changes to the final round of debate. 
The way the voter-approved law is written, businesses with fewer than 20 weekly employees would allow those employees to accrue up to five days’ worth of paid sick leave a year, or up to seven days a year for larger businesses. An hour of leave could be earned for every 30 hours worked. 
Employees, under the ballot measure law, can use paid sick leave for themselves or a family member for mental or physical illness, injury or a health condition or for a medical diagnosis or preventive medical care. Paid sick time also could be used during a public health emergency.
LB 415 changes
LB 415 would remove the current law’s blanket sick leave requirements, letting employers offer no paid sick leave to young teens, ages 14 and 15, or to temporary, seasonal agricultural workers and workers at the state’s smallest businesses, those with 10 or fewer employees. 
Sponsoring State Sen. Beau Ballard of Lincoln said the proposed legislation intends to clarify and make the ballot measure “more feasible” and workable for businesses. 
His bill would clarify that businesses that meet or exceed the new law would not need to change their existing leave policies, including accrual or carryover components. It also would clarify how leave can be requested and when employees could begin to accrue sick leave.
Worker advocates and union leaders have spoken out against the proposed changes as attempts to undermine the will of Nebraska voters throughout this session.

Tuesday’s debate followed an underlying theme of the session in the officially nonpartisan but GOP-dominated statehouse of lawmakers pushing back against a handful of ballot measures passed by Nebraska voters. That push has left Democratic-aligned lawmakers in the role of defending what they call the “will of the people.” The GOP has built a 33-member supermajority that sometimes makes the filibuster less effective.
“For as long as I can remember,” State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha said during the debate, “Nebraska has been doing as well as it has because you had just enough Democrats to save us from ourselves.”
Other Republican lawmakers said that they were trying to protect small businesses that could not afford paid sick leave in its voter-approved form. State Sen. Mike Jacobson of North Platte said he had received emails from small business owners in his district about the recent ballot initiatives. 
“We do live in a capitalistic society, and we are competing for employees, but there are smaller businesses out there,” Jacobson said. “In my district, they are being strapped. They can’t continue to employ people if we’re going to raise the minimum wage, have paid sick leave.” 
GOP-led maneuver exposes supermajority’s power
Throughout the debate, lawmakers, some begrudgingly, approved an amendment that would have reduced the carve-outs to businesses with five workers instead of 10 employees, and add back in the ability to sue to enforce provisions requiring paid sick leave.
It was viewed as a compromise to get some lawmakers, including State Sen. Dave “Woody” Wordekemper of Fremont and others, to vote for LB 415. As some Democratic-aligned lawmakers continued their filibuster of the proposal after the amendment’s approval,  Republicans stopped negotiating, reconsidered the amendment and voted it down. 
Jacobson led the successful push to reconsider the amendment.

“When we cast votes here, we’re not taking away what the voters said they wanted,” Jacobson said. “We’re making it so that it will work for small businesses and for their employers.” 
Jacobson said during the debate that Republicans are willing to bringLB 415 back to select file to add an amendment that would bring some of the ability to sue back into the bill but that lowering the size of business required to pay sick leave to five is off the table. 
Democrats speaking in opposition to the changes said more than 30,000 Nebraskans would lose paid sick leave, highlighting the political reality facing the majority. 
Wordekemper said his continued support for the measure depends on the amendments proposed, if senators decide to bring LB 415 back to select file.
Wordekemper voted present on cloture for the bill this round, but the bill advanced with the support of State Sen. Jane Raybould of Lincoln, a Democrat who voted for the bill and cloture. His vote is unlikely to affect the outcome. Ballard said after the vote that he has enough votes for passage during final reading despite the compromise amendment blowing up. 
Voters adopted the paid sick leave ballot measure with nearly 75% of the vote in November, including majority support across all 49 legislative districts. The measure was heavily supported by Nebraska labor groups. The voter-approved paid sick leave law is set to go into effect on Oct. 1.
State Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln said lawmakers should be ashamed, adding they just “told 30,000 Nebraskans that they don’t get the opportunity for paid sick leave.”
“You didn’t like the way that people were talking after that was adopted. It sounds like perhaps you decided to gut it and strip it,” Dungan said. “That’s being vindictive.”

(Photo by Russ Taylor/National Park Service)A state judge has blocked the Alaska Department of Fish and Game from conducting a controversial predator control program, ruling that the department acted “in bad faith” when it launched this season’s planned bear kills on Saturday.
Superior Court Judge Christina Rankin, in a ruling issued late Monday, granted a temporary restraining order sought by a conservation group that opposes the state’s program to cull bears in Western Alaska territory used by the ailing Mulchatna caribou herd.
Last week, Rankin ruled that a restraining order was unnecessary because the program was already legally voided by a previous court order that was still in effect. That previous order came in a March 14 ruling by Superior Court Judge Andrew Guidi, who found that the program, as originally authorized by the Board of Game in 2022, violated constitutional mandates.
But two days after Rankin issued her earlier ruling, the department on Friday announced that it planned to conduct this season’s bear-removal program anyway. The department, in a press release issued late Friday, said the program authorized by the Board of Game’s March 27 emergency action was unaffected by Rankin’s ruling.
The judge, in her order Monday, said that interpretation was wrong.
The March 27 emergency regulation “is invalid and without legal effect,” she said. The state disregarded directives in both Guidi’s order and her follow-up order, demonstrating bad faith, she said.
The state’s push for the emergency regulation and its decision to move forward with the program this past weekend even though it failed to fix the court-identified problems show that “continuing predator control by any means was the goal.”
The department’s predator control program killed 175 brown bears, five black bears and 19 wolves in 2023 and 2024. The animals were killed by being shot from aircraft.
Last weekend’s activities added to the toll. Eleven brown bears and one wolf were “removed,” Ryan Scott, director of the department’s Division of Wildlife Conservation, said by email.
Rulings by Rankin and Guidi resulted from a lawsuit filed in 2023 by the Alaska Wildlife Alliance. The alliance argued that the state’s program violated constitutional requirements for public notice and input and for management of public resources in a sustainable manner. The lawsuit argued that, among other failings, the state did not analyze the impacts of Mulchatna predator control on the area’s bear population, which includes animals that roam in Katmai National Park and Preserve.
Nicole Schmitt, executive director of the Alaska Wildlife Alliance, said Tuesday that it was a “big deal” that the state had been found to be acting in bad faith.
“The State got in planes and shot nearly 200 bears over the past two years,” she said by email. “When the Court found that the program was unconstitutional, we expected them to come to the table to remedy their mistakes — if the program was deemed unlawful, that means the State just poached hundreds of bears on Alaskans’ dime. Instead, they went back up in the air last weekend, in defiance of the Court’s order, to try poaching more. The Court’s most recent order is a much-needed affirmation and reminder to the Board of Game and ADFG leadership that wildlife management in Alaska is still a public process that requires at least some degree of biological sustainability.”
The state has argued that bear predation on calves is preventing recovery of the Mulchatna caribou herd. The aerial bear-culling program has thus been carried out in spring and early summer, when the caribou calves are being born.
In a statement, Alaska Department of Fish and Game Commissioner Doug Vincent-Lang said state officials are “extremely disappointed” with the ruling. “This will severely reduce our ability to rebuild this herd to provide sustained subsistence hunting opportunities as required under state law,” he said.
The department has ceased the program for this year and hopes to revive it in the future, he said. “While we continue to pursue any legal options available to us, we will schedule a Board of Game meeting in accordance with the court order to get the program re-authorized,” he said.
The Mulchatna herd’s population has declined dramatically in recent decades, from about 200,000 in the 1990s to about 15,000 as of 2024, according to the Department of Fish and Game estimates. Hunting has been barred since 2021, and the department maintains that predation by bears is preventing the herd from expanding to a size that will support hunting.
The department’s goal is for the herd to grow to between 30,000 and 80,000 animals.
The state’s Mulchatna predator control program has the backing of many of the region’s subsistence hunters, and the Alaska Federation of Natives in 2023 passed a resolution supporting it.
But critics argue that the focus on bears is misplaced. They say there are other and more likely reasons for the caribou population decline, including a rapidly changing habitat. Because of climate change, there are more woody plants growing on the tundra territory, a transformation that favors moose but not lichen-eating caribou. Other factors cited as possible causes of the herd’s decline include disease and past overhunting.
In addition to the Alaska Wildlife Alliance lawsuit, a separate lawsuit challenging the program is pending in state court. That lawsuit was filed by Anchorage attorney Michelle Bittner.

(Photo by Jon Cherry/Getty Images)Even as Republicans in Congress walk back their most aggressive proposal to slash federal Medicaid spending, they are weighing other options that could force states to cut services for children and other vulnerable populations.
U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters last week that his caucus won’t reduce the 90% federal funding match that states get to cover working-age adults who became eligible for Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. However, the GOP is still considering capping federal spending by setting a fixed amount for how much states receive for every Medicaid enrollee.
That move would fundamentally change the nature of the program, which has been an open-ended entitlement since its passage 60 years ago.
Another Republican congressional proposal would limit states’ ability to increase Medicaid payments to doctors and hospitals by using tax revenue they collect from health care providers. States draw down additional federal dollars by utilizing the strategy, and the extra money helps many hospitals stay afloat.
Any federal cuts to Medicaid — large or small — would strain state budgets and likely lead to service cuts and coverage for fewer people, according to a new analysis released last week by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
The agency predicted that to make up for lost federal dollars, states would have to reduce payments to health care providers, curb benefits or reduce enrollment. Some advocates also suggest that states might seek savings in other areas of their budgets, such as K-12 education.
Child health advocates say any of those actions would have a significant trickle-down effect on children and their caregivers. They’re concerned states would have to reduce or even eliminate services that help tens of millions of children access routine care that’s critical from birth, such as vaccinations and physical exams.
Half of U.S. kids
About half of the nation’s 72.8 million children are covered by Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP, another joint federal-state program that covers children from families who earn too much to qualify for traditional Medicaid.
“I think what is missing from some of these debates is [Medicaid] is not only the primary payer for children’s health, it’s also supporting the safety net for children’s health, by paying for hospitals, clinics, physicians and offices,” said Heather Howard, a former New Jersey health commissioner who is now a faculty affiliate with the Center for Health and Wellbeing at Princeton University.
“It’ll mean that hospitals will close in rural areas, but even in urban areas, we’re going to see, as hospitals see their funding cut, they’re going to have to pull back on services,” Howard added. “And that clearly is going to impact kids.”
Mississippi pediatrician Dr. John Gaudet said the importance of Medicaid for children begins at birth; Medicaid covered 41% of all U.S. births in 2021. The program also covers a benefit package called Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment, which covers an array of critical services meant to take care of childhood mental and physical health, such as dental and vision care, vaccinations, lab tests and physical exams.
The program serves children struggling with severe emotional distress, as well as physical disabilities. Medicaid pays for long-term and home-based care services.
Gaudet says he’s afraid that a variety of child-related services could be affected by federal Medicaid cuts.
“As a pediatrician, I’m very concerned about prevention and wellness, because that’s going to give you more return on your investment in the long run, if you can prevent an illness rather than wait until it gets more severe and then you’re having to treat it,” Gaudet said in an interview.
School health services
Medicaid cuts also could affect the health services offered in schools.
Between $4 billion and $6 billion in annual Medicaid spending helps pay for school-based health services, including routine health screenings, preventive care, mental health care and physical, speech and occupational therapies.
Children from underserved communities disproportionately rely on school-based health services, according to Abuko Estrada, vice president of Medicaid and child health policy at First Focus on Children, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit group.
“We’re not only talking about things like higher emergency room utilization for kids or increased hospitalizations for preventable conditions,” Estrada said in an interview. “We’re also talking about lost educational opportunities, potentially reduced future earnings in adulthood, and perpetuating cycles of poor health that ultimately cost the nation far more than it would potentially save.”
But Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that is working with Republicans to imagine Medicaid cuts, wrote in an email to Stateline that the ideas circulating on Capitol Hill wouldn’t harm children at all. Rather, he said, the proposed cuts would shift the funding focus away from working-age adults toward children and more vulnerable populations.
“In my view, it is a moral imperative for Congress to protect the program for the truly vulnerable and end Washington’s discrimination in favor of non-disabled, working-age, childless adults,” wrote Blase, who was a health care adviser to President Donald Trump during his first term.
Chris Pope, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning policy group the Manhattan Institute, said he doesn’t think Republicans in Congress will be able to cut much from Medicaid.
Republicans couldn’t get the votes to make major changes when they tried in 2017, Pope noted, and they have even fewer votes this year. “Unless they can get every Republican to sign off on cuts,” he said, “it’s just not going to happen.”
Republicans in Congress are trying to find roughly $2 trillion in savings to offset the cost of extending tax cuts enacted during the first Trump administration and to make additional tax cuts. The U.S. House committee that oversees Medicaid is supposed to come up with $880 billion of that total.
Despite Johnson’s assertion that reducing the federal Medicaid match for working-age adults is off the table, some fiscal hawks in his own party aren’t ready to give up the idea, which would save more money than any other proposal.
“It’s necessary to stop robbing from the vulnerable to fund the able-bodied,” U.S. Rep. Chip Roy of Texas wrote on X shortly after Johnson’s comments were reported.
In a May 7 letter to House Republican leaders, 32 GOP representatives vowed to find $2 trillion in cuts, calling the House budget framework “a floor for savings, not a ceiling. We must hold that line on fiscal discipline to put the country back on a sustainable path,” the letter said.
