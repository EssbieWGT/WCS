,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-16 21:53:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Report: Women at York Correctional were abused by officers,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/16/report-doc-fails-to-protect-women-at-york-from-sexual-abuse-by-correction-officers/,Disability Rights Connecticut found that DOC failed to protect women with mental illness from sexual abuse.,"A four-year investigation into sexual abuse at York Correctional Institution found that the Department of Correction failed to protect women in custody with mental illness from sexual abuse by correction officers, and was slow to review whether changes in security or policy could prevent further abuse.
Disability Rights Connecticut, the organization that published the report, began investigating the facility in November 2021, after receiving and investigating multiple complaints. 
“DRCT received additional information while investigating the complaints which gave rise to the reasonable belief of probable cause that multiple women with mental illness had been sexually abused,” the report said. “As a result, DRCT expanded its investigation into systemic allegations of sexual abuse for individuals with mental illness at YCI.” The investigation concluded last month.
Since 2021, six correction officers have been either charged with or convicted of sexual assault. Two more resigned after being investigated by the Connecticut State Police but were never charged. Another was fired by the Department of Correction in 2021.
Three additional officers are currently under investigation for sexual abuse. Two are banned from having contact with inmates and one is restricted to a specifica area. 
According to the report, DOC knew of multiple areas of the prison that were not covered by security cameras, which could have made it possible for correction officers to assault female prisoners without being seen. 
In one case, an unnamed incarcerated woman was assaulted by an officer in the laundry room at York multiple times. She said the officer told her that he loved her, and she believed they were in a relationship. The Department of Correction’s own investigation into the allegations — which is ongoing — found that wardens had been asking for cameras in the laundry room as far back as 2016, in response to earlier investigations into sexual assaults by correction officers in the same area. 
When the officer, who is still under investigation, was confronted, he pointed to the fact that there were no cameras in the laundry room, saying that “it was his word against that of [the unnamed woman],” according to DOC’s investigation and the DRCT report.
In 2023, a DOC contractor recommended replacing 10 cameras and installing 63 additional cameras at York. Those cameras have yet to be installed. Since the company made the recommendation, only two cameras have been added and one was replaced, according to the Disability Rights CT report. 
Correction Ombuds DeVaughn Ward said in a statement that he’d heard concerns about camera coverage and blind spots from both department staff and incarcerated people, and that the lapses “continue to present significant safety and accountability concerns.” 
The report also noted that many of the alleged assaults took place during the overnight shift, when there were fewer officers on duty. 
The report criticized the department for delays in completing sexual abuse incident reviews — documents that produce recommendations for how DOC might modify its policies or enhance security to prevent future sexual abuse. According to the report, there were no incident reviews produced in five of the seven allegations that the organization reviewed that were substantiated. 
None of the incident reviews for the seven substantiated cases included a recommendation that victims receive mental health treatment from providers experienced in treating victims of sexual abuse — despite this being included in both the department’s policy and the federal Prison Rape Elimination Act, which passed in 2003. 
One of the cases included in DRCT’s report was that of Lashanda Gregory, who filed a claim for $2.5 million with the state claims commissioner in June 2023 alleging that she had been sexually assaulted by two correction officers in 2022. She was granted permission to sue the state. 
Gregory’s lawyer, Alexander Taubes, alleged in a letter to Attorney General William Tong in November that Tong’s office had engaged in a pattern of “victim-blaming” toward Gregory after Assistant Attorney General Matthew Beizer, in an email to Taubes, said Gregory was “the instigator/willing participant in the incidents” of sexual assault, making her “contributorily negligent.” 
The DRCT report said one of the incidents involving Gregory likely took place in a mop closet, another blind spot out of sight of the cameras that DOC had flagged in its own reports. It also said Gregory never received mental health services from experts who had training in working with victims of sexual assault. 
Taubes told the Connecticut Mirror in a text message that the report’s findings about Gregory — including the lack of mental health treatment she received and the fact the department didn’t complete a sexual abuse incident review in her case — revealed systemic failures. 
“This report demands more than damage control. It demands accountability, independent oversight, and an honest reckoning with how women in state custody were treated — and how their abuse was minimized when it mattered most,” Taubes said. 
In three cases outlined in DRCT’s report, the Department of Corrections hadn’t conducted its own investigations. In one case, a woman reported in 2023 that she had been raped by two correction officers in 2014. Both officers had already left the department — one was arrested for sexual assault and one resigned over sexual misconduct, DRCT found. 
In another case, a woman alleged being raped by two correction officers and claimed that one of them was the father of her child. The officer was still working in the department — he was stationed at Manson Youth Institution — but DOC hadn’t interviewed him or tried to verify that he was the child’s father, according to DRCT. 
In a third case, an unnamed formerly incarcerated woman told a sexual abuse crisis counselor that an officer made “sexually suggestive comments” to her, tried to remove her clothes, and at one point forced her to touch him sexually while she was incarcerated from 2010 to 2014. 
“When asked why she did not tell [the officer] to stop these behaviors or report them to staff, [the woman] stated she laughed it off because these behaviors were part of the DOC culture,” the report read. 
When the woman made the allegation, in July 2022, the officer was on leave for worker’s compensation. He retired a few months later. According to the report, the officer was never interviewed, the investigation by the department was not completed, and nothing was done to remedy what had occurred. 
According to federal regulations, an agency is not authorized to end an investigation simply because the employee in question no longer works there, or the incarcerated individual in question has been released. 
Department of Correction spokesperson Andrius Banevicius said in a statement that the department “has a zero-tolerance policy for sexual assault / sexual harassment of any individual under its supervision.”
“The agency’s Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) Unit thoroughly and objectively investigates allegations of sexual abuse in accordance with Federal standards,” Banevicius said. “If allegations are substantiated, violators are subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment and/or criminal prosecution.”
Ward, the correction ombuds, also said in his statement that he found the report’s findings “deeply concerning,” adding that they “underscore serious breakdowns in the Department of Correction’s duty to protect incarcerated women from harm.” 
Disability Rights CT recommended that the department provide quarterly reports to the office of the correction ombuds listing any allegations of sexual abuse or harassment, and additional reports listing the status of any investigations into sexual abuse or harassment.
Ward told CT Mirror he supported this recommendation. 
The organization also called on state lawmakers to make it possible for any DOC employee to be charged with sexual assault in the second or fourth degree. The law currently restricts this to employees who have “supervisory or disciplinary authority over prisoners.” DRCT also recommended raising the penalty for second-degree sexual assault from nine months to two years. 
Sen. John Kissel, R-Enfield, the highest ranking Republican on the legislature’s Judiciary Committee, said in a statement that he planned to meet with the department’s leadership to discuss the report and make sure that changes were taking place to prevent further abuses.
“One of the utmost priorities of the Department needs to be ensuring the safety and wellness of all those within our facilities — incarcerated persons, DOC staff, and visitors,” Kissel said.
Sen. Gary Winfield, D-New Haven, co-chair of the Judiciary Committee, said that before submitting legislation to increase penalties, he wanted to look into whether the current penalties for sexual assault were being enforced. 
The state has a duty to protect people it’s holding in custody, he said, adding that he believes DOC must “get its act together” and address the sexual abuse that is occurring, along with the legislature. 
“ At the end of the day, the clear direction forward here is to pull our heads out of the sand and figure out what we’re not doing right and get it done,” he said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/York-CI-sign02.jpg,,,2025-12-16 16:57:58.647815

(Photo courtesy of the Office of the Governor) Gov. Tim Walz signed two executive orders Tuesday — one establishing a council and another directing state agencies to make gun violence prevention a priority — after several high-profile shootings over the summer and a subsequent failed effort to get the Legislature to pass new gun control laws.
Walz pledged in August to call a special legislative session to pass a ban on so-called assault weapons and additional school safety measures. The Minnesota Legislature is narrowly split, so Walz needed bipartisan agreement to pass any gun control bills.
Republican — and even some Democratic — lawmakers were not on board, and negotiations broke down in September. Walz and other Democratic-Farmer-Labor lawmakers have been holding town halls to promote gun control in recent months.
Walz’s latest executive orders are modest compared to the action he pledged after the August Church of Annunciation shooting killed two children and wounding more than two dozen others. The governor also wanted to address gun violence after House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark were shot and killed in their homes in June.
The first order establishes a Governor’s Statewide Safety Council that will create an “immediate action plan” to prevent future mass shootings, targeted attacks and domestic terrorism. The council will include members of the governor’s cabinet, law enforcement, school administrators and a representative from the Annunciation Hope Alliance.
The second order includes a broad directive to state agencies to “protect Minnesotans, particularly minors and vulnerable adults, from gun violence.” It also requires the Department of Public Safety to promote and educate Minnesotans about the state’s extreme risk protection order law, also known as the “red flag” law, and to promote the safe storage of firearms.
The Star Tribune reported in October that judges have used the red flag law to bar 281 people from owning guns for at least two weeks, including 10 people who had threatened violence at schools or day care facilities. Gun control advocates say more education about the law will improve its effectiveness.
“These actions today don’t limit your freedoms at all. Being shot dead in your school certainly does. We’re taking the action,” Walz said at a Capitol press conference surrounded by gun control advocates, lawmakers and parents of Annunciation children.
The executive order will also require companies that issue homeowner’s insurance in Minnesota to submit “detailed policy and claims data involving firearms.” The Department of Commerce will then analyze that data to make policy suggestions.
Walz, who is running for a third four-year term, laid the blame for lack of legislative action at the feet of House Speaker Lisa Demuth, who is a frontrunner in the race for the Republican nomination for governor.
“There is one person stopping us from having a vote in the House of Representatives right now to ban assault weapons,” Walz said. “The speaker of the house should … be standing with the parents and those who are up here. She should be standing with law enforcement who knows this is the right thing to do.”
The jab is another preview of what is likely to be a combative relationship between Walz and Demuth during the next legislative session, which begins in February.
Demuth hit back.
“Shame on the governor for politicizing tragedy, and shame on him for ignoring bipartisan safety solutions in favor of mockery and lies,” Demuth said in a statement.
The Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus said Walz is using the executive orders as “a distraction” from his failure to whip enough votes for his assault weapons ban.
“What we got today were low-impact orders that serve more as political cover than meaningful policy,” Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus Chair Bryan Strawser said in a statement. “It’s a distraction from the fact that the governor couldn’t build support for his agenda within his own party.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54988573698_a2c4565770_o-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-16 16:57:58.647815

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) A world-champion Cuban wrestler, Reineri Andreu Ortega, is suing the National Collegiate Athletic Association over rules that he says have unfairly barred him from wrestling for Iowa State University.
The lawsuit was filed this week by lawyers for Ortega, a student and prospective college wrestler at ISU, in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa. The lawsuit challenges the NCAA’s so-called “Five-Year Eligibility Clock” and the manner in which the NCAA decides when that clock begins running and thus when a student’s eligibility to compete expires.
Attorneys for Ortega argue that the NCAA’s application of the rule violates antitrust laws and unjustifiably restrains the ability of Ortega and other college athletes to “earn meaningful compensation that is now available to (other) NCAA Division I athletes.”
The lawsuit has its origins in a 2021 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court that paved the way for college athletes to receive compensation for use of their names, images, and likenesses. Since then, the market for name, image and likeness compensation opportunities available to NCAA Division I athletes has “exploded into a multi-million dollar industry,” the lawsuit claims.
However, the lawsuit adds, that form of compensation is largely available only to NCAA Division I athletes. Athletes who compete outside of what the lawsuit calls “the NCAA monopoly” have no meaningful opportunity to collect revenue-sharing income or profit from their name, image or likeness.
Under NCAA bylaws, an athlete has five years of eligibility to play four seasons of “intercollegiate competition” in his or her chosen sport. This five-year window is known as as the “eligibility clock” and begins to run from the date on which an athlete registers as a full-time student at any “collegiate institution” – regardless of whether the institution is a member of the NCAA and regardless of their participation in sports.
Lawyers for Ortega say this rule has had the effect of barring students from competing in NCAA sports even if they’ve never competed. They say students such as Ortega “can attend a non-NCAA college for three years without playing any sports, take two years off from school for personal reasons, transfer to a four-year NCAA school, and the student will have used all of their eligibility without ever having competed in a college sport for a non-NCAA or NCAA college.”
Ortega studied in Cuba before coming to ISU
The lawsuit claims Ortega completed high school in Cuba in the spring of 2016, and then, beginning in the fall of 2016, he began taking courses at Manuel Fajardo University in Cuba. In 2017, Ortega began training and wrestling for the Cuban National Team, which has no affiliation to a college or university, while continuing to study at Manuel Fajardo University until the spring of 2019.
Ortega is a two-time U23 world champion and two-time Pan American gold medalist, according to USA Wrestling.
In December 2022, Ortega left the Cuban National Team and came to America as a refugee. In the spring of 2023, Ortega enrolled at ISU where he earned a spot on the wrestling team but without competing during the 2022-23 season.
According to the lawsuit, the NCAA has denied Ortega’s request for eligibility beyond the 2022-23 season due to the five-year rule, indicating Ortega’s eligibility clock started while he was attending Manuel Fajardo University, not when he enrolled at ISU.
Counting the years that a student attends a non-NCAA institution as years on their NCAA eligibility clock is arbitrary and capricious, the lawsuit alleges. “Ortega, and other wrestlers or prospective athletes in other sports who are harmed by this illegal restraint have a small window of time to compete in Division I sports and earn the permissible compensation now available to them,” the lawsuit claims.
Ortega claims that the NCAA has effectively excluded him from an NCAA Division I college career, and because, as a 130-pound athlete, he has very limited pro-wresting opportunities open to him after college, a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction barring the continued application of the eligibility rule is necessary.
Lawsuit cites pro athletes’ eligibility 
According to the NCAA, the purpose of the five- year rule is to “move student-athletes toward graduation in a timely manner” – eliminating any incentive to remain in school simply to compete. Lawyers for Ortega, however, contend the rule doesn’t exist “for reasons of competitive balance or it would preclude other older athletes from competing” in Division I NCAA sports.
The lawsuit notes that students who graduate high school and become a professional athlete in one sport can play that other sport for years, then go to college and still have five years of eligibility to play four seasons of some other sport.
“The NCAA rules, therefore, do not limit the ability of the former professional athlete to earn permissible compensation while competing in Division I athletics, even though they have had a chance to physically mature well beyond a typical 18-year-old college freshman,” the lawsuit alleges. “For instance, Chris Weinke entered Florida State University as a freshman following a six-year professional baseball career and ended up winning the Heisman Trophy, awarded annually to the most outstanding player in college football, at 28 years of age.”
The lawsuit claims the NCAA’s application of the five-year rule violates the Sherman Act by restraining the market for NCAA Division I college athletes by barring Ortega and similarly situated athletes from having an opportunity to earn money through revenue sharing and the use of their name, image and likeness.
As part of the lawsuit, lawyers for Ortega also argue that should the court grant their requested injunction against the NCAA, it must also address a separate NCAA rule. That rule says if a student-athlete who is deemed ineligible by the NCAA is permitted to participate in sports in accordance with the terms of a court order that is later vacated or reversed, the NCAA can take punitive action against the school – such as vacating wins or imposing postseason-competition bans and financial penalties.
The lawsuit seeks an immediate temporary restraining order, a preliminary injunction, and then a permanent injunction that will block the NCAA from applying the five-year rule to students such as Ortega.
The NCAA, which is an association of post-secondary institutions that functions as the governing body of college sports, has yet to file a response to the lawsuit.
The NCAA includes more than 1,100 member colleges and universities organized into three divisions, with 350 of them in Division I.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/isu-sign.jpg,,,2025-12-16 16:57:58.647815

(Photo: Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)North Carolina ranks near the bottom nationally for teacher pay growth and per-student public school funding, according to a new report by the libertarian think tank Reason Foundation.
The findings about North Carolina are similar to the results of studies by other organizations, including the National Education Association. They are notable, however, because they come from a right-leaning group.
The report found the state ranked 48th in both teacher salary growth and per-pupil funding from 2002 to 2023. While overall education spending increased during that period, inflation and rising benefit costs significantly eroded teachers’ purchasing power, according to the analysis.
Nationwide, per-student funding grew from $14,969 to $20,322 during that period. New York topped all states at $36,976 followed by New Jersey at $30,267. In all, eight states exceeded $25,000 per student in 2023.
Compare that to North Carolina where per-pupil spending in 2023 was just $13,661, ranking 47th in the nation. Idaho, which ranked last, was the only state spending less than $12,000 per student.
North Carolina’s per-student funding grew just 8.5% between 2002 and 2023, ranking 48th in the nation. But it rose slightly in recent years largely because of federal pandemic relief dollars. From 2020 to 2023, per-pupil spending increased 8.7%, slightly above the national average. But those gains may not continue now that federal relief funds have expired.
“With federal pandemic relief funding now expired, combined with rising economic uncertainty, declining public school enrollment, and increased competition from school choice and homeschooling, the era of unrelenting public school funding growth may be coming to an end,” the report says.
Since 2002, student enrollment in North Carolina increased 17.2%, the ninth-highest growth rate in the country. Over the same period, the number of non-teaching staff — including administrators, counselors, and social workers — grew 18.2%, outpacing growth in the teaching workforce.
Nationally, the report found non-teaching staff increased more than three times faster than teacher hiring.
The report comes as the General Assembly has failed to pass a full budget and the North Carolina Supreme Court has yet to resolve the Leandro school funding case, a decades-old legal fight over the state’s obligation to fully fund a “sound, basic education” for all public school students.

The University of Delaware Fightin’ Blue Hens will play in their first bowl game as an FBS school against the University of Louisiana Lafayette Ragin’ Cajuns in Mobile, Alabama, Wednesday night.
 
The University of Delaware finished its football season with a dominant win against UTEP in its regular season finale on November 29. The win was UD’s sixth of the season making the Blue Hens bowl eligible in their inaugural season of FBS football, but it was in question whether the Blue Hens would actually play in a bowl game.
The NCAA has a rule for teams making the transition up to the FBS level that requires the transitioning team to sit-out postseason games the first two years of their transition. That meant UD couldn’t participate in the FCS postseason last year and wouldn’t be eligible for a bowl game this season. 
That was until there weren’t enough bowl eligible teams to fill out the available 82 bowl game spots. 
UD and fellow CUSA member Missouri State each received a bowl selection in their first FBS season joining Jacksonville State and UAB as the only schools since 2012 to make a bowl game in its inaugural FBS season. UAB failed to defeat Ohio University in its first bowl game, but Jacksonville State won its initial bowl game in 2023. The Gamecocks’ opponent in that game was the Ragin’ Cajuns whom Delaware faces Wednesday.
Who Are the Ragin’ Cajuns?
Louisiana finished the regular season with a 6-6 record similar to the University of Delaware. The two teams have never met in any sport thus far making this game the two’s first introduction to each other.  
The Ragin’ Cajuns started the season slowly losing three of their first four games before starting their Sun Belt conference slate. The Ragin’ Cajuns lost three straight conference games following a double overtime victory over Marshall to begin conference play. Louisiana’s three losses came against the eventual Sun Belt champions James Madison University, Southern Mississippi, and the west division leader Troy.   
Following the loss to Troy, Louisiana dominated the month of November defeating all four of its conference opponents finishing the season on a four game winning streak to clinch a bowl berth. The Ragin’ Cajuns have made a bowl game in each of their last eight seasons — including this season — and have made a total of 15 bowl game appearances. Two of their 15 bowl appearances were vacated due to NCAA sanctions.
This season Louisiana featured a balanced attack ranking seventh in the Sun Belt in both points per game (27.1) and points allowed per game (30). The Ragin’ Cajuns did most of their offensive damage on the ground rushing for over 2,000 yards this season. Running back Bill Davis paced the attack with a team high 739 rushing yards. Redshirt junior Zylan Perry and quarterback Lunch Winfield each rushed for over 600 yards supplementing Davis’ production. The Louisiana passing game isn’t as dynamic, ranking last in the Sun Belt averaging a little more than 156 air yards per game. 
The Ragin’ Cajun defense ranks slightly better against the passing game than the run game, ending the regular season ranked seventh in the conference against the pass and 11th against the run. Senior linebacker Jaden Dugger and defensive end Jordan Lawson are the names to watch on the unit. Dugger is third in the Sun Belt with 118 total tackles this season and Lawson finished the regular season with 12 tackles for loss and five sacks. 
Where and How to Watch
The game is scheduled for 8:30 p.m. EST Wednesday night and will air on ESPN. This is UD’s first neutral site game since 2011, but that doesn’t mean the UD fandom can’t support from the comforts of Delaware. 
There are three locations in Newark holding watch parties for Blue Hen fans. Grain Craft Bar and Kitchen and Buffalo Wild Wings are hosting watch parties at their Main Street locations and Tommy’s Tavern at Christiana Mall will hold one as well, according to an email from UD’s athletic department. There will also be watch parties at Rehoboth Ale House in Rehoboth, Delaware, and 902 Brewing Co. in Jersey City, New Jersey, for Blue Hen fans closer to those areas.

(West Virginia Legislative Photography)West Virginia education officials have until spring to finish an appeal to the state Supreme Court over a Raleigh County Circuit Judge’s ruling in a case at the center of a debate over religious freedom and the state’s strict school vaccine requirements.
The court issued a scheduling order Tuesday in the case of West Virginia Board of Education, et al v. Miranda G., et al. 
Raleigh Circuit Judge Michael Froble issued a statewide ruling Nov. 26 that enjoined the state and Raleigh County school boards from using the state’s school vaccine law to deny school admission to plaintiffs in the lawsuit and anyone who had requested or been granted a religious or philosophical exemption to the school vaccine requirements. 
Days later the Supreme Court granted a stay in the case that temporarily halted the ruling. 
Raleigh County parents Miranda Guzman and Carley Hunter filed the lawsuit against the school boards, which have refused to accept religious exemptions to the state’s school vaccine requirements. 
States generally require students to be vaccinated against a series of infectious diseases, like measles, polio and whooping cough. West Virginia has been one of only five in the country that do not allow students to opt out of the requirements because of religious or philosophical objections to the shots. 
Gov. Patrick Morrisey issued an executive order requiring the state to allow religious exemptions on his second day in office. He’s not rescinded the order even though state lawmakers voted down legislation that would have codified the exemptions. His order is based on the state’s Equal Protection for Religion Act of 2023. 
Under the Supreme Court’s order Tuesday, the school boards have until March 26, 2026 to perfect the appeal. After that, attorneys for Guzman and Hunter will have 45 days, until May 11, 2026, to file a respondent’s brief and then the board of education will have until June 1, 2026 to file a reply brief. 
Once the June 1 deadline is passed, the court could decide the case on its merits without oral arguments or set the case for oral arguments and then decide the case on its merits.

The initial conversations, held Wednesday and Thursday during a joint meeting of the state House and Senate committees on universities and colleges, will likely continue during the 2026 legislative session. 
Here are four key takeaways from the committee meetings. 
Some lawmakers want to tie state funding to public universities based on post-graduation student success 
The goal is to get a better value for taxpayers to ensure college students are getting the best benefit of their education and the state is getting a return on investment for them to enter the workforce, said Sen. Nicole Boyd, a Republican from Oxford and the Senate committee chair.
Higher education systems in some states, such as Texas, Tennessee and Florida, use a performance-based funding model. Their models reward institutions for graduating students, placing them in jobs with median wage earnings,  and helping high need populations succeed. 
“Effective funding formulas focus on success within a six month period of graduation,” Nathan Oakley, senior policy director for ExcelinEd, a national nonprofit thank tank, asked during a presentation to legislators. The means of success include “whether a student has found employment, enlisted in the military or enrolled at another post-secondary intuition or program.” 
Legislators acknowledge that Mississippi’s eight public universities operate under a broken funding formula. The amount of state funding awarded to the Mississippi Institutions of Higher Learning has decreased from 35% to 26% in the past decade, said LeAnn Robinson, director of the legislative budget office. Those colleges and universities now rely heavily on tuition to generate revenue. 
The IHL Board of Trustees is working with the National Center for Higher Education Management Systems to review and define metrics of success for each of its public universities, Commissioner Al Rankins said. IHL’s current funding is based on a broad approach that allows universities to receive equal funding regardless of enrollment growth or post-graduation success.  
With a recommendation from NCHEMS, IHL is considering a few formulas including one based on enrollment and tuition revenue in anticipation of an “enrollment cliff” — a decline in the number of high school students applying to state universities, Rankins said. 
Public university enrollment increases overall, but some institutions have seen declines
Overall, the state’s public universities saw a 2.7% increase in student enrollment with more than 81,961 new, first-time students on campuses this fall compared to 79,817 students enrolled in fall 2024, according to an annual report by the IHL board. 
But there’s been a general decline in enrollment for the past decade at  Delta State, Mississippi University for Women, Alcorn State and Mississippi Valley State, Rankins said. 
Some of the state’s research institutions, including University of Southern Mississippi and Jackson State, have also seen a slight decline in enrollment in the past 10 years, Rankins said. 
Mississippi State University and University of Mississippi, the state’s flagship institutions, are the only two institutions that have seen a growth in enrollment in the past decade. Public universities have to be more intentional with the impending challenges of the enrollment cliff in the next few years, Rankins said. 
Legislators are considering offering financial aid to nontraditional students
Al Rankins, Jr. is the Commissioner of the Mississippi Institutions of Higher Learning. 
Jennifer Rodgers, executive director of the state’s financial aid office, suggested a way to meet the state’s education attainment goals, boost its financial aid system and create job opportunities for working-age adults: creating the Mississippi Workforce Promise Program. 
Boyd and other lawmakers plan to propose legislation in January for an adult workforce grant program, which would be piloted at a few community colleges.
The program would involve providing grants for nontraditional students, including those older than 24 and not enrolled in school full time, who are pursuing a degree or credential.
The state does not currently offer financial aid to nontraditional students,  but they make up a large portion of the state’s post-secondary population, Rodgers said. 
In recent years, the state has also redefined its educational attainment and workforce goals to get more college graduates to stay in Mississippi and contribute to its labor force and economy. In 2022, the state Chamber of Commerce and AccelerateMS, the workforce development office, launched Ascent to 55%, an initiative to get more than half of Mississippi’s workforce college educated by 2030, on par with the national rate. As of January, 48.7% of Mississippians ages 25 to 64 have a degree, credential or industry certification beyond high school.
The state has also outlined a number of job shortages in high-wage, high-demand fields such as nursing and health care technicians, IT and cyber security specialists, welders, electricians and plumbers and manufacturing trades, according to AccelerateMS. By 2035, the state would need to produce an additional 19,000 skilled workers for these in-demand fields. 
The Mississippi Workforce Promise Program could be a chance to tap into a group of students to educate or offer job opportunities or training, Boyd said. Other states such as Tennessee and Michigan have used similar grant programs to expand their workforce and lower barriers for students to get their degrees, training or credentials, Rodgers said. 
Adults who complete the program are students who would likely stay in the state, especially if they’ve established families or work in Mississippi, Rodgers said. 
Empowering Mississippians with financial literacy resources can help the state’s future economy 
Combined with Mississippi’s low median income of $56,820, the average federal student loan debt — $37,552 — creates the worst debt-to-income burden in the nation, said Apryll Washington, deputy director of the Mississippi Office of Student Financial Aid. 
More resources and support are needed to educate college students on financial literacy, said Jean Massey, executive director of Ascent to 55%. 
Mississippi requires high school students to complete a college and career readiness course with a financial literacy component to graduate. The course covers topics including budgeting, saving, credit and completion of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA.
But after high school, many students are then saddled with debt such as rent, credit card and loan payments, Massey said. Requiring first-year students to take a money management course at universities and colleges could be a strategy to improve graduates’ financial future and help Mississippi’s economy. 
“I think we have to empower our students,” Massey said. “We can partner with local credit unions, banks and nonprofits to provide expertise and mentorship. We can give students access to digital tools for how to track, monitor and spend their money.”  
State institutions including the University of Mississippi, Jackson State, University of Southern Mississippi and Mississippi College offer financial literary courses or coaching for students. But state higher education leaders must examine ways to ensure students are set up for success, Massey said. 
“We need to give choices and opportunities for students to move forward,” Massey said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/04192227/Senate-study-group-4.jpg,,,2025-12-16 16:57:58.647815

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Lawmakers from Iowa and Ohio have introduced legislation to the U.S. House of Representatives aimed at increasing housing access and affordability for college students.
Reps. Zach Nunn, R-Iowa, and Greg Landsman, D-Ohio, brought forward the “Campus Housing Affordability Act” Tuesday, Nunn announced in a press release. If passed, the legislation would amend current law to allow certain students enrolled in higher education to apply federal housing assistance to their university dwellings.

“College should be about learning and earning a degree, not worrying about where you’re going to sleep at night,” Nunn said in the release. “Housing insecurity undermines academic success, increases the risk of dropping out, and puts a higher education out of reach for too many students. This bipartisan bill gives every student a fair shot at success—regardless of their background or ZIP code.”
According to the release, the bill would let students with Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers use them for campus housing and bar vouchers offered through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development from being counted as income. This will stop students from “being disqualified from additional forms of financial aid,” the release stated.
These changes would also “expand access” to the communities and support systems found on college campuses, which have been shown to strengthen retention and graduation rates. The release stated that close to 48% of U.S. college students face housing insecurity, and 81% of those impacted by housing insecurity report “they would perform better academically if they had access to safe, reliable housing.”
“We can make college way more affordable, and this bill does that for countless Americans,” Landsman said in the release. “In fact, this will be transformative for students who have been historically left out and marginalized. Campus housing is an enormous expense for students, and our bill eliminates that expense for students who are eligible for housing vouchers.”

The stocky man, said to be about 5-feet, 8-inches tall, had not been carrying anything in previously released images. He wears the same two-tone jacket, black medical face mask and dark colored hat he has on in videos released at a late afternoon briefing Monday. Police did not say when or where the image was captured.

Local, state, and federal officers continued to search for evidence near the campus Tuesday in their efforts to identify the man responsible for killing two students and wounding nine other people on Saturday around 4 p.m. 
Seven of the nine people treated for gunshot wounds remained at Rhode Island Hospital as of late Tuesday morning. Five were listed in critical stable condition, and one patient was listed in critical condition. One was listed as stable.
Law enforcement officials are relying on the public’s help to collect more information and surveillance recordings of the suspect. The FBI is offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to the identification, arrest and conviction of the individual responsible.
Anyone who recognizes this individual, is asked by police to to contact the FBI through its online tip center or to call (401) 272-3121. 
Police released magnified video of the suspect at 4:30 p.m., ahead of press briefing scheduled for 5 p.m. at the Providence Public Safety Complex.
In the first video released Saturday night, a person dressed in dark clothing is seen walking away from the Barus and Holley engineering building from the Hope Street side and rounded the corner heading east on Waterman Street. He vanished into a residential neighborhood adjacent to the Ivy League campus.
FBI investigators early Tuesday afternoon walked along the suspect’s known path, rummaging through bushes, looking over fences, and interviewing residents outside the stately and Victorian-era homes near the crime scene.
 


While Brown University is dotted with cameras, there are few in the Barus and Holley building, multiple students told Rhode Island Current. 
Police were effectively the only people on campus Tuesday afternoon, with streets around Brown quiet as most students have left Providence.
Susan Alpert, who works the deli counter at the Metro Mart on Thayer Street, said the primary commercial hub for the university has effectively become a ghost town since Saturday.

“This is normally an incredibly busy time here,” she said in an interview.
Up the block at the Brown University bookstore, one employee who declined to give her name noted that finals tend to be quiet. The only difference is there’s now a university police officer present at its entrance.
“Rhode Island has long watched the national epidemic of mass gun violence from a painful distance. This weekend, that distance disappeared,” read a joint message to the community released Tuesday from Providence City Council President Rachel Miller, President Pro Tempore Juan M. Pichardo and Majority Leader Pedro J. Espinal. 
“As we grieve, we are now united with communities across the country — Columbine, Virginia Tech, Sandy Hook, Orlando, Uvalde, and so many more — who know this kind of loss all too well. In time, we hope to honor the victims not only through remembrance, but by working together toward a safer world for everyone.”

‘They were at the beginning of a lot of things’
Brown University on Tuesday morning officially released the names of the two students who died in Saturday’s shooting in a message from President Christina Paxson. Ella Cook, 19, a sophomore from Mountain Brook, Alabama, and MukhammadAziz Umurzokov, 18, of Midlothian, Virginia, a first-year student, were killed when the gunman entered a large auditorium where a review for an economics final was taking place.
Two Brown University students who lost their lives in campus shooting identified

“These were two young people whose amazing promise was extinguished too soon,” Paxson wrote. “Both were at or near the beginning of their Brown journey — actually, they were at the beginning of a lot of things.”
“Before releasing their names, it was important that we give their families some space to grieve, but now it is important that we never forget them,” Paxson continued. “I expect that, like me, many of you have begun reading about Ella and Mukhammad in news reports and on social media. None of those reports, nor anything that I share here, could ever begin to fully capture the totality of who they were, nor the enormity of who they never had the opportunity to become.”
Cook served as vice president of the Republican Club of Brown University and a member of the Alpha Chi Omega sorority. An accomplished competitive pianist and church volunteer leader in her hometown near Birmingham, she was interested in French and Francophone studies.
Umurzokov dreamed of becoming a neurosurgeon and planned to concentrate in biochemistry and molecular biology. He was a U.S. dual citizen from Uzbekistan who graduated from Midlothian High School where he served as president of the school’s Model United Nations chapter and captain of the Scholastic Bowl team. 
“Both were brilliant and beloved — as members of our campus community, but even more by their friends and families,” Paxson wrote. “Our hearts continue to be with them in their profound sorrow.”
Brown support staff in Campus Life and student leaders of the Undergraduate Council of Students among others are contributing ideas for how the campus will join together as a community to memorialize Cook and Umurzokov after classes resume after winter break, Paxson said. Details will become available in the weeks ahead but for now, a virtual interfaith prayer service for Wednesday is planned.
A GoFundMe fundraiser for Umurzokov’s family had raised nearly $437,000 from 9,300 donors as of mid afternoon on Tuesday.

(Courtesy photo)Marion County Sheriff Kerry Forestal — who is term-limited — will run for the Senate District 31 seat in central Indiana.
“My neighbors in District 31 deserve to know that their voice in the State Senate will fight every single day to make their lives better — from bringing down the cost of utilities, healthcare, and groceries, to keeping our communities safe,” Forestal said in a Tuesday news release. “I’m the person to do just that.”
Sen. Kyle Walker, R-Lawrence, announced earlier this month that he will not seek a second term in the state Senate.
Senate District 31 is one of the state’s few politically close Senate districts, covering the northeastern corner of Indianapolis and the Fishers area in Hamilton County.
Foresta, a Democrat, is in the third year of his second term as sheriff. But he has been a law enforcement officer in Marion County since 1977.  In 2010, he was appointed by President Barack Obama to serve as U.S. Marshal for the Southern District of Indiana, overseeing federal law enforcement across 62 counties.
If elected to the state Senate, Forestal said he would prioritize “pragmatic, values-driven leadership” on issues like public safety and protecting working families from rising costs — including utilities and health care.
Forestal has received some recent criticism for working with the U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement and holding hundreds of detainees in the county jail.
As sheriff, he has advocated for a “common-sense approach” to public safety that addresses fundamental issues including mental health and addiction services in what many say is Indiana’s largest mental health facility – the Marion County Jail.
Forestal oversees the MCSO’s $150 million budget “with a focus on evidence-based violence prevention that keeps violent criminals behind bars while helping to ensure people can return to society as productive citizens after incarceration,” according to the news release.
The announcement also noted that the sheriff has been recognized for his office’s work on diversity and equity, and he was personally honored with the State Rep. Bill Crawford Legacy Award from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, or NAACP, in 2025.

The Santa hat is on display at the Cosmosphere in Hutchinson. (Photo submitted by the Cosmosphere)TOPEKA — The science behind Santa’s magical ability to traverse the world in one night to deliver toys and joy may always remain a mystery.
But possibly, the jolly old fellow might have picked up a tip or two when his hat took a flight aboard Space Shuttle Discovery during a Hubble Space Telescope mission, called STS-103, in 1999.
Whether the hat has any real magical vibes is up for debate, but anyone who is interested can visit the Cosmosphere in Hutchinson to check it out. 
“STS-103 holds a unique place in spaceflight history as the only one of NASA’s 135 Space Shuttle missions to take place during the Christmas holiday,” a news release from the Cosmosphere said. “To mark the occasion, the crew found small ways to bring holiday cheer with them into orbit, even as they prepared for one of the most important scientific servicing missions ever conducted.”
The Santa hat on display was worn by astronaut John Grunsfeld during a brief holiday celebration on the Space Shuttle Discovery’s middeck, the release said. 
“Grunsfeld and his fellow mission specialists then began their suit-up procedures to carry out a series of critical spacewalks to service and upgrade the Hubble Space Telescope,” the news release said. 
STS-103 included three spacewalks and the replacement of key components on the telescope.

(Photo via Google Earth)An eastern Iowa veterinary hospital is suing its insurer in a dispute over the definition of an “animal.”
Animal Eye Consultants of Iowa, located in the Linn County town of Hiawatha, is suing Sentinel Insurance Co. in U.S. District Court, alleging breach of contract and bad faith.
According to its website, AECI provides clinical and hospital treatment for animals specifically related to vision and eye health.
The lawsuit alleges that about 8:15 a.m. on Nov. 7, 2024, an adult deer crashed through one of the hospital’s windows and entered the building. “The deer rampaged through the property’s interior spaces, destroying numerous veterinarian specialty equipment, as well as computers, screens, media devices, and other pertinent veterinarian supplies,” the lawsuit claims.
Later that day, AECI’s chief executive, Dr. Sinisa Grozdanic, filed an insurance claim with the hospital’s insurer, Sentinel. The insurance company then sent a hired adjuster to the hospital to assess the damage and prepare an initial financial estimate of the loss.
The insurer later sent an estimate to Grozdanic, who concluded the adjuster did not have the knowledge or expertise to estimate the loss, according to the lawsuit. AECI then contacted actuarial experts in an attempt to secure estimates of what it perceived to be the actual damages sustained by the business.
According to the lawsuit, Sentinel then expressed its view that portions of AECI’s claims were excluded under the supplemental policy that theoretically provided an additional $350,000 in coverage for damage to computers and computer equipment.
That supplemental policy allegedly lists specific exclusions, stating in part, “We will not pay for loss or damage caused by or resulting from … insects, birds, rodents, or other animals.”
The lawsuit states that AECI countered with various legal opinions indicating the exclusion was “not meant for large, wild animals causing physical damage to the property, but instead was designed to eliminate liability for the insurer should an infestation of similar nuisance animals be discovered on the property after a mechanical failure.”
The lawsuit cites legal rulings that indicate when “general words follow an enumeration of specific items, the general words are construed to embrace only objects similar in nature to those enumerated.”
Interpreting the insurance policy, as Sentinel has, so that the phrase “other animals” includes a large, noninvasive wild deer to be similar or reasonably similar in nature to insects, birds and rodents is “improper, and Sentinel’s misinterpretation was purposeful, and intended to cause harm to AECI,” the lawsuit alleges.
With the dispute still unresolved, losses at the hospital continue to accrue, the lawsuit claims.
Sentinel has yet to file a response to the lawsuit, which was originally filed Oct. 31, 2025, in Linn County District Court before being moved to federal court this week.

Williams livestreamed the announcement to run for 13th district made at his kitchen table, a choice he said underscores his focus on the “kitchen table issues” facing West Virginia families:  cost of living, child care, housing, health care costs and other financial decisions that families make.
“At the end of the day, most of the decisions people care about don’t happen in the Capitol — they happen at the kitchen table,” Williams said in a news release. “Families are trying to figure out how to afford groceries, child care, housing, health care, and utilities. My campaign is about meeting people where they actually live — not just geographically, but economically.”
Williams, a financial advisor from Morgantown, was first elected to the House of Delegates in 2016. The 2026 legislative session will be his 10th as a member of the House. 
His decision to run for Senate comes as the Democratic Party plans an aggressive push to win seats in state Legislatures across the country. Democrats currently make up only two members in the 34-member Senate and nine in the House of Delegates, which has 100 members.
The 13th Senate district includes parts of Marion and Monongalia counties and is currently represented by Republican Sen. Mike Oliverio, a longtime lawmaker and a Morgantown financial advisor. During the last election in 2022, he narrowly defeated Democrat candidate Barbara Fleischauer, pulling in 13,459 votes to Fleischauer’s 13,297, according to reporting by the Dominion Post. 
Oliverio has filed as a pre-candidate and announced his intention to run for re-election in 2026. 
“I love this job and I love serving the people of Monongalia and Marion Counties of District 13 as a member of the State Senate,” he wrote on Facebook. “I humbly ask for your vote in the May 2026 primary and hopefully again in the November General Election. I look forward to a productive session in the Senate next January to continue to fight for an even better West Virginia.”
The official candidate filing period for the 2026 election runs from Jan. 12 through 31. There were no other pre-candidates listed for the seat as of Tuesday.

(Photo: Brandon Hull/Office of the Governor)Tennessee farmers and forest owners who suffered agricultural losses due to Hurricane Helene will receive $38.1 million in assistance from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
The funding will cover infrastructure and timber losses, future economic losses and market losses, the USDA announced on Dec. 12. The funds will be administered to eligible farmers by the Tennessee Department of Agriculture.
“This block grant funding recognizes the unique challenges faced by Tennessee’s agricultural producers in the wake of Hurricane Helene and will help cover a wide range of critical current needs as well as setbacks still to come,” Tennessee Agriculture Commissioner Andy Holt said in a news release.
The funds come from $30 billion earmarked for disaster relief block grants in 14 states — including Tennessee — under the American Relief Act of 2025. 
Carter, Cocke, Greene, Hamblen, Hawkins, Johnson, Unicoi and Washington counties are covered under the program, according to the state.
Assistance will be distributed to applicants as a lump sum. A minimum of 10 acres under single ownership is required to qualify. Verified damage must exceed a minimum of $1,000. For timber producers, a minimum of 15% of their acreage must be affected.
The amount given to each applicant will depend on funding and applications received, and will be capped at 90% of applicants’ reported loss. Applicants who have received other federal funding for Hurricane Helene relief can still apply for assistance under this program, but only if they haven’t yet reached the 90% cap.
Registration and application dates have yet to be announced. The Tennessee Department of Agriculture and USDA are developing a plan to administer the funds, according to the state. Once the USDA approves Tennessee’s plan, application information will be updated on the Tennessee Department of Agriculture’s website. Applicants will then have 90 days to apply.
Landowners affected by Hurricane Helene can gather documents they will need in the meantime, including proof of ownership or control of land, proof of producer eligibility, documentation of losses and financial and tax documentation.
Farmers seeking future economic or market loss assistance must purchase Federal Crop Insurance or Noninsured Disaster Assistance Program (NAP) coverage for 2026 and 2027 and confirm with NAP eligibility or Whole Farm Revenue Protection options with their local Farm Service Agency office.
This Tennessee assistance program is in addition to a round of disaster relief announced by the USDA in November for farmers nationwide who suffered losses from natural disasters in 2023 and 2024.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-16 21:02:15+00:00,CT Mirror,Aquarion to seek 42% rate increase after regulators block sale,John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/16/aquarion-rate-increase-1216/,The request comes after PURA regulators blocked a deal that would have transformed Aquarian into a nonprofit quasi-public entity.,"Connecticut’s largest water company, Aquarion, announced its intention to seek a 42% rate increase on Monday after state regulators last month blocked a deal that would have transformed the company into a nonprofit quasi-public entity.
The proposed rate hike, worth $88 million annually, would be first in more than a decade for the company, which serves roughly 209,000 homes and businesses in Connecticut. 
It comes on the heels of last month’s decision by the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority to reject the proposed sale of Aquarion to the South Central Regional Water Authority, a quasi-public utility based in New Haven. The sale would have created a sister utility, the Aquarion Water Authority, to operate the company’s assets.
While Aquarion’s owner, Eversource, is appealing the ruling, company officials said they’ve been left with no other choice than to raise rates in order to offset rising operating costs.
In a letter to PURA on Monday announcing the company’s plan, Aquarion Chief Operating Officer Lucy Teixiera placed the blame for the proposed rate hike squarely on regulators for rejecting the sale, which, Aquarion said, would have saved customers money.
“Aquarion’s sale to AWA provided PURA with a rare and unique opportunity to shield customers from these increasing costs,” Teixiera’s letter said. “A decision approving the transaction would have enabled AWA to own and operate Aquarion, thereby obviating the need for the immediate filing of this rate amendment with PURA.”
A spokesperson for Eversource declined to provide additional comment on the letter Tuesday.
Critics of the proposed sale — worth a total of $2.4 billion, including debt — argued that it would have saddled both RWA and Aquarion customers with higher costs, as well as the loss of oversight from PURA, which regulates only privately owned utilities. In addition, local officials in many of the towns within Aquarion’s service areas raised concerns about the loss of future tax revenues from the utility’s equipment.
The letter served as formal notice that Aquarion plans to submit an application for a rate increase within 60 days. If approved, the new rates would go into effect on Nov. 1, 2026.
As part of their bid to gain approval for the sale, RWA officials pledged not seek an rate increase on Aquarion’s customers for at least six months. Beginning in 2027, they projected that the utility’s customers would see annual increases of between 6.5% and 8.35% over the next decade — a far slower pace of increases than the 42% hike sought Monday.
PURA’s decision to reject the sale focused largely on concerns over the new entity’s governing structure, rather than its finances or ability to provide safe, drinkable water to customers. 
In a statement Monday, Attorney General William Tong compared Aquarion’s plans to the company’s last request for a $37 million rate increase in 2022. 
Instead of approving that request, PURA ordered the company to cut its rates by nearly $2 million, a decrease of 11%. After failing to support its “bloated claims,” in that case, Tong said Eversource tried and failed to offload Aquarian.
“PURA was right to reject that bad idea as well,” Tong said. “Now they are back seeking an even bigger rate hike for Aquarion. We’re going to do what we always do — comb through every line and every page of their filings to ensure Connecticut families aren’t paying a penny more than they need to.”
Claire Coleman, the head of the Office of Consumer Counsel, which advocates on behalf of state’s utility customers, was also critical of Aquarion’s justification for the proposed rate hike. 
“While OCC understands that ongoing investment is necessary to provide safe, reliable water service, the scale of the increase Aquarion is signaling is significantly above my team’s initial internal analysis as well as the company’s own recent estimates,” Coleman said in a statement. “Once the application is filed, our review will focus solely on what the evidence supports. The notice of intent reads more like a list of grievances than a legal filing, but rates are set by evidence, not indignation.”
In her letter PURA, Teixiera pointed to factors to justify the proposed rate increase, including rising costs related to the treatment of PFAS chemicals and more than $448 million spent on water infrastructure since the company’s last rate case.
The letter made no mention of Marissa Gillett, the former head of PURA, who is at the center of a long-running dispute between the utility companies and their regulators in Connecticut. Gillett led the authority at the time that PURA ordered Aquarion to cut its water rates in 2023.
Later, the company participated in a lawsuit claiming that Gillett had abused her authority by issuing unilateral decisions and boxing out her fellow commissioners. Gillett resigned in October, shortly before attorneys in Tong’s office conceded that many of the utilities’ claims were true.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/saugatuck.jpg,,,2025-12-16 16:57:58.647815

The CAI[...]","Hiba Rahim, interim executive director for CAIR-Florida, speaking in Tampa on Dec. 16, 2025. (Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)TAMPA — The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the nation’s largest Muslim civil-rights organization, has filed a federal lawsuit challenging Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ executive order issued last week designating the group as a “terrorist organization.” CAIR is asking the court to block the executive order and declare it unconstitutional.
The CAIR-Foundation and CAIR-Florida filed the lawsuit in the Northern District of Florida in Tallahassee on Monday.
DeSantis issued his executive order on Dec. 8, designating CAIR a “terrorist organization.” The order directed Florida’s executive and Cabinet agencies, as well as every county and city, to deny local or state contracts, employment, funding, benefits, or privileges to CAIR and anyone known to provide “material support” to CAIR, including “expert advice or assistance.”
The order directs the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) and the Florida Highway Patrol (FHP) to undertake “all lawful measures to prevent unlawful activities in Florida” against terrorist organizations designated in Section 1 of the executive order, which includes the Muslim Brotherhood.
“This executive order does not present facts, it does not cite investigations, it does not point to any criminal findings. It simply declares guilt by proclamation,” said Hiba Rahim, interim executive director for CAIR-Florida, during a press conference at the organization’s Tampa headquarters Tuesday.
“It does not matter whether you agree or disagree with our policies or our advocacy. What should concern every American is the implication of allowing a government official to apply criminal designations without due process. This is not how things work in America. In this country, allegations come with evidence and evidence is tested in court. And it is judges, not politicians, who decide what is lawful.”
CAIR has never been declared a foreign terrorist organization by any federal agency.
In alleging that DeSantis has violated the Constitution, the lawsuit contends that he has:

Illegally usurped the exclusive authority of the federal government to designate American organizations as terrorist groups based on allegations of material support for foreign terrorist groups.
Violated the Constitution’s guarantee of due process by unilaterally designating CAIR a criminal actor and then ordering immediate punitive, discriminatory action against CAIR and its supporters without any chance to appeal that punishment or designation.
Violated the Constitution’s guarantee of free speech by punishing Americans who seek to provide CAIR with material support, including speech in the form “assistance” and “advice,” and retaliating against CAIR for speech he finds objectionable, including the organization’s past lawsuit against him and its activism in support of Palestinian human rights.

CAIR-Florida and DeSantis do have a history in the courts. In November 2023, one month after the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas against Israel, CAIR National and CAIR-Florida filed suit against Florida officials including DeSantis, challenging state directives to deactivate Students for Justice in Palestine chapters at Florida public universities. In January 2024, a federal judge dismissed the lawsuit, ruling that the case was not valid because the ban had not been enforced.
Florida joins Texas
During Tuesday’s news conference, CAIR officials said that in filing the lawsuit, they weren’t just standing up for Muslim rights, but constitutional rights for others as well, and noted that they have been joined in the lawsuit by the Southern Poverty Law Center, the Muslim Legal Fund of America, and the Michigan law firm Akeel & Valentine.
Saying the executive order calls on the FDLE and FHP to prevent all “unlawful activity” by CAIR, attorney Omar Saleh added that he thought such laws were already in place. “But Gov. DeSantis wants to add additional penalties, just in case you’re Muslim or if you support a Muslim group, and it doesn’t work that way in this country,” he said.
DeSantis’ executive order listing both CAIR and the Muslim Brotherhood as “terrorist organizations” came three weeks after Texas Gov. Greg Abbott issued a proclamation prohibiting CAIR and the Muslim Brotherhood and its members from purchasing or acquiring land in the state, accusing them of supporting terrorism and undermining Texas laws through harassment, intimidation, and violence.
On Nov. 24, President Trump issued an executive order that sets in motion a process by which certain chapters of the Muslim Brotherhood “shall be considered for designation as Foreign Terrorist Organizations.” CAIR has previously said that it has no association with the Muslim Brotherhood.
Texas U.S. Republican Sen. John Cornyn announced Monday that he wants to eliminate CAIR’s tax-exempt status as a 501(c)3 nonprofit, saying in a written statement that the group “is a radical group of terrorist sympathizers with a long history of undermining American values.”
CAIR was established in 1994 and now has 25 chapters around the state, including in Tampa and Miami. CAIR officials were asked Tuesday to speculate about why they are now being targeted by two states and a U.S. senator.
“This has been happening much longer than a month ago, but it’s picking up a lot more because public officials are being more brazen in showing what their true thoughts are about Islam and Muslims,” said Saleh. “When Texas happened, we knew Florida would be coming, because we know that’s what the governor’s sentiment is.”
Thania Clevenger, national chief operating officer for CAIR, agreed that negative allegations regarding the organization aren’t new, but said they have been growing steadily since the Hamas attack on Israel two years ago.
“The impact against the community has been growing steadily since Oct. 7 with the Palestinian movement,” she said. “Our work has been effective. We have sued governors across the country who are ‘Israeli First.’ And so that action has brought more scrutiny to CAIR.”
‘Discovery rights’
When asked for comment, the governor’s press office sent the Phoenix previous statements DeSantis has made over the past week on social media and in person regarding his decision to issue the executive order.
“I welcome the lawsuit because what will happen is, that will give the state of Florida discovery rights to be able to subpoena the bank records. … And honestly, it gives us even more reason. … And so this is something that our attorney general is ready, willing and able to fighting on this, DeSantis said on Dec. 9 in North Miami Beach.
“They have every right to sue, and then we’re going to have a right to get the information that we need to make sure. But our agencies are on notice about how any of our programs or any of our operations are impacted, or not impacted, and so to the extent that they can be, then they’re going to have a basis to be able to protect the people and the taxpayers from that.”
DeSantis added in that press conference that “people forget CAIR was an unindicted co-conspirator in the Holy Land Foundation trial, the largest terror financing trial in the history of the United States of America. If there were any other situation where that happened, then people would be up in arms, but somehow that’s something that just gets forgotten.”
“A lot of it is financial,” he went to say. “That’s why I think a lawsuit is something that we very much welcome for that.”
That was a reference to a 2008 federal conviction of five former leaders of a U.S.-based Muslim charity named the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development.
CAIR had been included in the list of un-indicted co-conspirators in the case. The organization was not indicted, however, and on its website CAIR says that “the U.S. Attorney who led the Holy Land Foundation case confirmed decisions to indict were based only on evidence and law — not politics.”",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/0-5-1024x771.jpeg,,,2025-12-16 16:57:58.647815

We are moving more quickly than ever before to put new strategies in place to […],"Minnesota Capitol. (Photo by Minnesota House Public Information Services)The Minnesota Department of Human Services announced Tuesday it will soon pause licensing of new adult day care centers as the Walz administration expands its probe of fraud in human services programs.
“We are not just talking about reducing fraud. We are moving more quickly than ever before to put new strategies in place to get ahead of the criminals stealing from taxpayers,” temporary DHS Commissioner Shireen Gandhi said at a Tuesday news conference.
The announcement comes the day before the state House fraud committee is scheduled to hear testimony about adult day care services.
The agency said the licensing pause will likely last for two years — from Feb. 1, 2026 through Jan. 31, 2028 — and will allow regulators to focus on oversight of existing licensed providers. The agency may make exceptions for new providers in working with counties, tribes and managed care organizations.
The number of adult day cares, which provide meals and activities for disabled adults during the day, already have capacity for about 3,000 more people than currently receive services. That capacity has increased by 43% over the past five years even though there was only a 7% increase in the yearly average number of Medicaid participants, Gandhi said.
This is the second time DHS has leveraged its new authority — granted by the Legislature earlier this year — to pause licensing if it finds new applications are growing beyond program needs. More licensing pauses are likely on the way, DHS Inspector General James Clark said.
A rapid increase in demand for services has been a signature feature of human services later found to be rife with fraud. For instance, payments to autism therapy providers increased 3,000% from 2018 to 2023, the Reformer was first to report.
DHS officials initially said they were neither surprised nor disturbed by the rapid growth, noting it was in line with the growth of Housing Stabilization Services, a program Gov. Tim Walz would eventually shut down entirely earlier this year, citing suspicions of widespread fraud.
DHS is also investigating reports of kickbacks in the adult day care program, in which service recipients were allegedly paid to switch from one provider to another, Clark said.
“Kickbacks are a sign that there’s an oversaturation of providers,” Clark said. “When there is not a way to drum up legitimate business, providers try to drum up illegitimate business.”
DHS has recovered “several hundred thousand dollars” from adult day centers in recent years and referred more than 100 providers across Medicaid-funded service programs to law enforcement for criminal investigations this year, Clark said.
Some providers warn the Walz administration’s heavy-handed approach will hurt legitimate services providers and the disabled people they serve.
After years of sluggish response to reported fraud, the issue now hangs heavy over Walz as he seeks an unprecedented third four-year term against a bevy of Republican challengers. Among them: Rep. Kristin Robbins, who chairs the House fraud committee that meets Wednesday.
Recent national coverage has also rocketed the issue beyond Minnesota’s borders, attracting the attention of President Donald Trump and his cabinet.
The Walz administration has responded in recent months with a series of actions aimed at clamping down on the flow of government funds to providers deemed suspicious.
DHS catalogued in a press release the steps they’ve taken to address fraud this year, including terminating Housing Stabilization Services, hiring the health care company Optum to audit billing in 14 “high-risk” services and pausing licenses for Home and Community-based Services, which include group homes for people with disabilities.
The agency has also disenrolled around 800 inactive providers in “high-risk” programs and moved 11 Medicaid benefits into a “high-risk classification,” which allows regulators to increase scrutiny including through unannounced site visits and other oversight actions.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/596812282_1290057636490087_3676829915866584955_n-1024x677.jpg,,,2025-12-16 15:57:50.580616

Laura Kelly answers questions from Kansas Reflector senior reporter Tim Carpenter during a Dec. 16, 2025, interview at her office in the Statehouse. (Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Gov. Laura Kelly predicted Tuesday the 2026 Legislature wouldn’t muster enough political support to implement a new congressional district map splitting Johnson County and making it easier to defeat Democratic U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids in the midterm election.
Kelly, the two-term Democrat entering her final year as governor, said the political landscape in Kansas appeared unchanged since House Speaker Dan Hawkins, R-Wichita, conceded in November he lacked enough signatures from Kansas House members to trigger a special session on redistricting.
While Hawkins fell about 10 signatures short of the required supermajority needed to convene in special session, enough Kansas Senate Republicans signed a petition to authorize a special session devoted to congressional mapping. The GOP leadership’s objective has been to implement a Kansas map to oust Davids, the state’s lone Democrat in the federal delegation, without threatening the three incumbent Kansas Republicans in Congress.
The administration of President Donald Trump urged GOP-led states to gerrymander enough districts so Republicans could remain in control of the U.S. House.
Hawkins and Senate President Ty Masterson, R-Andover, said their strategy would be to consider redistricting when the 2026 Legislature convened Jan. 12 for its regular session.
“In some ways, I’ll be surprised if they even really bring it up,” Kelly said in an interview with Kansas Reflector. “I don’t think a lot has changed in terms of where legislators stand on the issue.”
Kelly said it was interesting Hawkins couldn’t convince the minimum of 84 House members to sign a special session petition, because her years serving as a state senator demonstrated legislators were more inclined to authorize debate on a topic than to vote for an actual bill. While it would take simple majorities of 63 votes in the House and 21 votes in the Senate to pass a new map, a veto by Kelly would lead to a scramble for 84 votes in the House and 27 votes in the Senate to secure the supermajority required for a veto override of the governor.
“There are times when legislators will vote for a process and then turn around and vote against the action,” Kelly said. “I would be very surprised if they were able to get that passed with the veto-proof majority.”
The governor said the political appetite for mid-decade redistricting in Kansas resembled that of Indiana, where Republicans recently defeated a push by Trump to change that state’s congressional map.
“The people spoke out very loudly there,” Kelly said. “While we haven’t had people in the rotunda discussing redistricting, all the polling has shown that it’s not popular in Kansas. It’s not something people are interested in. People really want the Legislature to deal with the issues that impact them day-to-day.”
In a recent interview at a meeting of the American Legislative Exchange Council, Masterson said he was confident the Legislature would work through redistricting challenges in the upcoming session.
“We’ll have no trouble for sure passing a new map with majorities,” said Masterson, who is a GOP candidate for governor.
Hawkins, who is seeking the GOP nomination for state insurance commissioner, said he was less confident the Legislature would cobble together the GOP coalition necessary to implement a new congressional map.
Davids, a four-term Democrat serving the Kansas City area, has condemned the attempt by Republicans to cave to special interests demanding mid-decade redistricting in Kansas. The current congressional district boundaries in Kansas were changed in 2022 to reflect population shifts and the GOP’s desire to undercut Davids, but the new approach would seek to weaken Davids’ reelection odds by cutting Johnson County in half.
In anticipation of the remapping battle, the Legislature spent $43,000 to acquire software and training to prepare for redrawing to congressional boundaries.
“It’s outrageous that politicians in Topeka secretly used Kansans’ hard-earned tax dollars to silence the very people footing the bill — all for a map folks haven’t seen and a process they’ve been cut out of,” she said.
U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran, a Kansas Republican, told KMUW the tradition of amending congressional maps once each decade to comply with population changes should be retained in Kansas.
“There’s a bit of fairness that I think ought to be preserved about this issue,” Moran told KMUW. “We have a practice that we’ve utilized for a long period of time. We reapportion at that census moment, and that makes sense to me.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/PC160845-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-12-16 15:57:50.580616

(Henry Redman | Wisconsin Examiner)The Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa filed a lawsuit Tuesday against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, challenging the corps’ decision to grant a permit allowing the oil company Enbridge to reroute its Line 5 pipeline around the tribe’s reservation in northern Wisconsin
The lawsuit, filed in the Washington D.C. federal circuit court, is another step in the long legal history of the Enbridge pipeline and the company’s effort to move it from its current route through the tribe’s land. The tribe is asking that the permit approval be vacated. 
In October, the corps approved Enbridge’s permit to reroute the pipeline off the reservation despite significant public opposition. 
The new route moves the pipeline south but it still runs across land on three sides of the reservation and crosses the Bad River upstream of the reservation. The permit was approved as the administration of President Donald Trump has moved to more aggressively support oil and natural gas projects. Earlier in the year, the corps approved a fast-tracked permitting process for Enbridge to construct a tunnel across the Straits of Mackinac so Line 5 can cross from Michigan’s Upper Peninsula to its Lower Peninsula. 
The tribe’s lawsuit alleges that the corps violated the National Environmental Policy Act, Clean Water Act and the Administrative Procedure Act by not properly conducting required environmental reviews or following the proper procedures. 
“For hundreds of years, and to this day, the Band’s ancestors and members have lived, hunted, fished, trapped, gathered, and engaged in traditional activities in the wetlands and waters to be crossed by the Project,” the lawsuit states. “The Project would encircle the Reservation on three sides and damage areas the Band highly values for their ecological and cultural significance. The Corps’ failure to properly review and address the Project’s environmental impacts to wetlands and waterways harms the Band’s interest in maintaining its Reservation homeland and resources in the ceded territory.”
The lawsuit alleges that the corps violated the NEPA by not giving proper consideration to the “environmental effects of construction, maintenance, and operation of the Project,” including how it will harm the health of resources on and near the reservation. 
Under the Clean Water Act, the corps cannot approve permits until the state or tribal government responsible for water quality in the project area certifies the project won’t harm the local water. While the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources did previously approve the state permits for the Line 5 reroute, those permits are currently being challenged in a separate legal process. 
The tribe alleges in the lawsuit that the corps should not have moved forward with its permits until after the state process is complete.  
[The corps] violated the Clean Water Act by issuing the Permit without ensuring that construction and maintenance of the Project would not adversely affect Wisconsin and the Band’s water quality,” the lawsuit states. “This includes issuing a … permit while the required … state water quality certification is not yet final, pending state administrative proceedings; without addressing the inadequacies the Band identified with Wisconsin’s Water Quality Certification; or ensuring compliance with the Band’s water quality standards.” 
The lawsuit also states the permit approval does not address how the project construction will affect the tribe’s “ability to exercise treaty-protected rights to hunt, fish, trap, and gather in ceded territory,” “failed to evaluate the risks and impacts of oil spills along the pipeline route” and “failed to evaluate the risks and impacts of blasting as a construction method.” 
In a statement, tribe chairwoman Elizabeth Arbuckle said the tribe would do whatever it can to protect the health of the Bad River, Lake Superior and surrounding watersheds. 
“For more than a decade, we have had to endure the unlawful trespass of a dangerous oil pipeline on our lands and waters,” Arbuckle said. “The reroute only makes matters worse. Enbridge’s history is full of accidents and oil spills. If that happens here, our Tribe and other communities in the Northwoods will suffer unacceptable consequences. From the Bad River to Lake Superior, our waters are the lifeblood of our Reservation. They have fed and nurtured our Tribe for hundreds of years. We will do everything in our power to protect them.”
Enbridge spokesperson Juli Kellner said in an email that while the Army Corps made an initial permit decision, it has not been signed by the corps or the company and therefore isn’t a final decision that can be challenged in court. She said the company would intervene in the lawsuit to defend the permit approval. 
“Enbridge submitted permit applications to state and federal regulators in early 2020 to build a new segment of pipeline around the Bad River Reservation,” she said. “Enbridge’s permit applications are supported by thorough and extensive environmental analysis and modeling by leading third-party experts confirming project construction impacts will be temporary and isolated, with no adverse effect to water quality or wetlands.”

Idaho Department of Lands Director Dustin Miller said the $68.2 million funding distribution is a record high amount, due to a combination of increased timber sales and low expenses.
“We saw increased revenue from endowment lands this past fiscal year mostly through the increase in our timber harvest level over time,” Miller said. “Also, one thing I am proud of is that while our revenue is going up, expenses are staying relatively flat. This is an added benefit to the beneficiaries.”
The Idaho Constitution requires Idaho to manage state endowment lands so they generate the maximum financial return for beneficiaries. There are nine different endowment fund beneficiaries, the largest of which is the state’s K-12 public school system. Other beneficiaries include colleges and universities, state veteran homes, state hospitals, the Idaho School for the Deaf and the Blind and correction facilities. 
While public schools will see $68.2 million in funding, the total funding distribution for all beneficiaries was nearly $110.4 million, the Idaho Department of Lands announced in a press release issued last week.
During ceremonies Tuesday at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise, Miller presented the ceremonial $68.2 million check to Gov. Brad Little and other state officials as the Capital Singers choir from Capital High School performed Christmas carols in the Capitol rotunda.

The $68.2 million is a fraction of the $2.6 billion general fund maintenance budget that Idaho legislators set for K-12 public schools for the current fiscal year. But every dollar counts when the state budget is projected to have a $40 million deficit in the current fiscal year 2026 and a $555 budget deficit for next year in fiscal year 2027.
After the ceremonies, Miller told the Idaho Capital Sun that increases in timber harvests on state endowment lands helped pay for the funding distribution. Miller said revenue has grown by an average of 2.6% a year since 2016, while expenses have grown by just 1.6% over the same time, Miller said. 
“After ramping up to 330 million board feet of volume sold annually, we have begun to realize the increased income from timber,” Miller said. “There has been some increase on the land leasing side, but most of the increase in land income came from timber.”
When Idaho became a state, Congress granted Idaho about 3.6 million acres of state endowment land for the purpose of providing funding for beneficiaries, such as the K-12 public school system. After some land has been sold off and consolidated, Idaho now has about 2.5 million acres of state endowment land.

(Photo by Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota leaders appointed Jared Huibregtse to the North Dakota Ethics Commission on Tuesday, ending a nearly two-month stalemate over who to appoint to an open four-year seat on the commission.
Huibregtse is a Mandan resident and project manager for an engineering firm. 
The selection committee consists of Gov. Kelly Armstrong, Senate Majority Leader David Hogue and Senate Minority Leader Kathy Hogan.
Hogue and Hogan supported reappointing commissioner Murray Sagsveen, which Armstrong firmly opposed.
Sagsveen withdrew his name from consideration in a Thursday letter to Armstrong.
Ethics Commission member withdraws application to serve another term

Huibregtse was among seven finalists for the position. Thirty-nine people applied for three open positions. 
Huibregtse said in a Tuesday interview he has accepted the appointment. He plans to attend the Ethics Commission’s next meeting on Wednesday.
“I’m just looking forward to digging in,” he said.
In an interview with the selection committee, Huibregtse said he wants to help the commission find clarity on areas where there is disagreement, like the scope of its authority.
“I don’t have a problem being the only one with a dissenting opinion,” he said.
Huibregtse manages water infrastructure projects at engineering firm Bartlett & West, according to his resume.
“I think we all felt he was fully qualified,” Hogan said during a selection committee meeting on Tuesday.
He formerly worked for the North Dakota Department of Water Resources and was in the North Dakota National Guard.
North Dakota attorney general voids ethics opinion, says agency lacked authority

The committee recently appointed former Office of Management and Budget Director Pam Sharp and Fargo attorney Mark Western to two other open seats on the commission.
Sagsveen’s term ended Aug. 31, but he stayed on the commission while the committee was deciding who would take his position.
Armstrong previously said he opposed reappointing Sagsveen because he feels the Ethics Commission needs a “general reset.” The governor has expressed concerns that the Ethics Commission has overstepped its jurisdiction, and was especially critical of an advisory opinion the commission issued related to campaign finance. The North Dakota Attorney General on Friday voided the advisory opinion, finding that it could not advise on “general questions of law.”
Hogue and Hogan had strongly supported Sagsveen, in part to promote continuity on the five-member commission. Sagsveen had not commented publicly about the process until withdrawing last week.
“It has dragged on for several months and it’s in the best interest of the Ethics Commission that a person be appointed for a full four-year term,” Sagsveen told the North Dakota Monitor on Friday. “It was obvious to me that it was an impasse.”
The selection committee members discussed changing their procedures to make the commissioner appointment process smoother in the future. Armstrong recommended starting the application process earlier, for instance.
All three committee members also thanked Sagsveen for his service.
“I didn’t want this meeting to close without recognizing his extraordinary service,” Hogue said.

Miller and Mikhail Zinshteyn,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/12/proposition-50-republican-lawsuit-hearing/,"Republicans and the Trump administration are hoping a panel of federal judges in Los Angeles will halt the new Prop. 50 maps from taking effect. But given the Supreme Court’s recent ruling greenlighting Texas’s redrawn maps, their odds are long.","In summary
Republicans and the Trump administration are hoping a panel of federal judges in Los Angeles will halt the new Prop. 50 maps from taking effect. But given the Supreme Court’s recent ruling greenlighting Texas’s redrawn maps, their odds are long.


Just last week California’s secretary of state officially certified that nearly two-thirds of Californians voted to pass Proposition 50, Gov. Gavin Newsom’s plan to temporarily gerrymander the state’s congressional maps in favor of Democrats.
Nevertheless, Republicans and the Trump administration are hopeful that a federal district court panel meeting in Los Angeles this week will intervene to bar the state from using the new maps next year. 
California Republicans, who sued Newsom and Secretary of State Shirley Weber the day after the election, are staking their challenge on the argument that California’s primary mapmaker illegally used race as a factor in drawing district lines, giving Latino and Hispanic voters outsize influence at the expense of other racial and ethnic groups, including white voters. 
This, the Republicans argue, means the maps amount to an illegal racial gerrymander and a violation of the 14th and 15th amendments. Although Section 2 of the federal Voting Rights Act allows for race-conscious redistricting, they add, case law and judicial precedent have set a strict standard that requires a minority group to prove they have been systematically outvoted by a majority that consistently votes together to deny the minority their chosen candidate. 
But the Prop. 50 opponents’ odds look slim, especially after the U.S. Supreme Court’s conservative majority recently blessed Texas’s new maps, overturning a lower court’s finding that Republicans there had engaged in unconstitutional racial gerrymandering. 
“It is indisputable that the impetus for the adoption of the Texas map (like the map subsequently adopted in California) was partisan advantage pure and simple,” wrote conservative Justice Samuel Alito in a concurring opinion supported by Justices Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas. 
And then there’s the looming possibility that the Supreme Court, in a separate case, could outlaw entirely the use of race in the redistricting process, which could render California’s new maps — as well as the previous ones drawn by the independent citizens commission — unconstitutional. That would also give Republicans a major advantage in Southern states, where several districts drawn to increase Black Americans’ voting power are currently represented by Democrats. 
Despite the long odds, the ailing California GOP has run out of other options for resistance. The passage of Prop. 50 is likely to mark the beginning of the end for several of California’s Republican House members, who have been forced to decide whether to run in their current, now less favorable Republican districts, switch to new seats or drop out entirely. 
One of them, Rep. Darrell Issa, who represents parts of San Diego County, even considered relocating to Texas and running for a Dallas-area seat that would be more friendly to Republicans, but the president reportedly refused to endorse him for the already contested Texas seat, so he decided to stay. 
The legal challenge claims the Prop. 50 maps cause “stigmatic and representational injury” by placing certain candidates, such as Republican Assemblymember David Tangipa of Fresno, who is Polynesian, into districts drawn with a specific racial or ethnic minority group in mind.
Case is in Los Angeles court this week
The challengers, who include Tangipa, the California Republican Party, several Republican voters and the Trump White House, are asking a three-judge panel for the Central District of California to grant a preliminary injunction on the maps before Dec. 19, the date when candidates can start collecting signatures to get their names on the 2026 primary ballot. A preliminary injunction would temporarily prevent the maps from being used in an election.
On Monday in court, the Republican challengers presented their case, arguing that since supporters of Prop. 50 publicly touted that the maps increased representation for Latino voters, state lawmakers and consultant Paul Mitchell, who was hired to draw the maps, took race into account. Therefore, they must justify how their new districts meet the standard for permissible racial gerrymanders, attorneys argued.
“It is legal to race-based redistrict under the Voter Rights Act. Section 2 protects it. But it also gives you guidelines,” Tangipa told CalMatters in an interview after testifying in court on Monday in Los Angeles. “In Sacramento, they did not follow those guidelines.”
Tangipa asserted that even though Democratic lawmakers intended primarily to increase their party’s ranks based on political ideology, “They used race to justify that end goal.”
The plaintiffs sought to have Mitchell testify, but the court denied a request to force him to take the stand to explain whether he intentionally tried to increase the voting power of specific racial and ethnic groups. Since Mitchell lives more than 100 miles away from the court, he was out of the reach of a subpoena. Still, the judges questioned his blanket use of “legislative privilege” to resist producing documents the plaintiffs requested.
At one point, as a redistricting expert testified, the plaintiffs focused on a line from Democratic former Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire’s public statement after the Legislature passed the package of bills paving the way for the Nov. 4 special election. 
“The new map makes no changes to historic Black districts in Oakland and the Los Angeles area, and retains and expands Voting Rights Act districts that empower Latino voters to elect their candidates of choice,” McGuire’s statement said. 
McGuire announced last month that he will challenge Republican Rep. Doug LaMalfa in one of the newly configured Prop. 50 seats.
But proponents of the new maps argue they intended purely to create a partisan advantage for Democrats, and any increase in voting power for certain ethnic or racial groups was incidental. 
Ultimately, ‘it was endorsed by the voters’
Also complicating the GOP’s challenge is that California voters overwhelmingly approved the maps.
“Even if we assume that the Legislature improperly considered race, ultimately it went into effect because it was endorsed by the voters,” Emily Rong Zhang, an assistant professor of law at the University of California at Berkeley School of Law, previously told CalMatters. “They would have to show that the voters had the intent to create districts that disproportionately favor the voting power of a racial group over another.”
One unknown is how the Supreme Court will rule on a case that questions whether it’s constitutional to even consider race as a factor when redistricting.
The justices are weighing in another ongoing case, Louisiana v. Callais, whether to strike down a part of the federal Voting Rights Act that requires the creation of districts in which racial and ethnic minorities have a chance to elect their preferred candidate. If the ruling is retroactive, a decision to strike it down could invalidate both California’s old and new maps. 
Regardless of how the Supreme Court rules, other states have jumped into the redistricting effort or are contemplating entering the fray. In addition to Texas and California, four other states have already implemented new congressional maps, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Virginia, Maryland and Florida have also taken some steps toward redistricting.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/092525-Redistricting-Day-2-LV-CM-30.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-16 15:57:50.580616

Jeff Landry’s administration confirmed the sudden end of a $4.2 billion Medicaid contract that provides health insurance to more than 330,000 people, state officials backed off their original plan and said they would seek an extension of the arrangement through March instead. (Michelle Liu/Verite)Just a week after Gov. Jeff Landry’s administration confirmed the sudden end of a $4.2 billion Medicaid contract that provides health insurance to more than 330,000 people, state officials backed off their original plan and said they would seek an extension of the arrangement through March instead. 
The state will continue to work with UnitedHealthcare of Louisiana to provide Medicaid coverage if the company agrees to a short-term supplemental contract. The arrangement would be worth approximately $561 million and go through the first 90 days of 2026, Health Secretary Bruce Greenstein said.
UnitedHealthcare could not immediately be reached for comment Tuesday afternoon.  

The extension would mean the 330,000 people with UnitedHealthcare Medicaid plans would not have to be transferred to another insurance provider before the end of the year. 
The Landry administration eased up on the abrupt contract cancellation in response to pressure from several state senators during a hastily called legislative hearing on the arrangement Tuesday. 

The senators questioned whether the Landry administration would be able to shift hundreds of thousands of people from one Medicaid plan to another over the next two weeks without massive disruptions. They worried that Medicaid recipients — as well as hospitals, doctors and other medical providers who treat Medicaid patients — were not prepared for such a massive overhaul during the holiday season. 
The change of course over UnitedHealthcare is the second time this month Landry’s health department has reversed the cancellation of a Medicaid contract worth billions. 

On Dec. 2, the health department sent notices to UnitedHealthcare and Aetna Better Health of Louisiana announcing their contracts would be abruptly terminated at the end of the year. The health department then reinstated a one-year contract extension with Aetna on Dec. 9, a few hours after a news story about the ending of the contracts was published. 

Attorney General Liz Murrill has been behind the push for the state to terminate its relationship with UnitedHealthcare and Aetna. Her office is suing both companies and their affiliated pharmacy benefits managers on behalf of the state over their business practices. 

But she is finalizing a settlement agreement with Aetna worth approximately $50 million that would end that litigation, which is why the Aetna contract was restored. 
Murrill is still at an impasse with UnitedHealthcare, whose potential lawsuit liability is much higher, between $388 million and $768 million, she said Tuesday. 

The health department’s 90-day extension of the UnitedHealthcare contract will give Murrill’s office three more months to negotiate with the company.
If the state and UnitedHealthcare agree to a settlement during that time, its Medicaid contract with the state might be extended through the end of next year, according to the attorney general and Greenstein. 

The Louisiana Department of Health partners with six private companies to provide Medicaid insurance plans to 1.4 million people across the state. The other businesses offering plans include AmeriHealth Caritas, Healthy Blue, Humana Healthy Horizons and Louisiana Healthcare Connections.

The Michigan Senate Appropriations Committee heard testimony from leaders of nonprofits and local government entities who had around $645 million in funding cut by the Michigan House Appropriations Committee last week in a hearing that included no testimony or debate prior to the vote. 
“I want them to have the opportunity that they didn’t have in the chamber across the hall. I want them to be heard,” committee Chair Sen. Sarah Anthony (D-Lansing) said, calling the decision by House Republicans “an exercise in political gamesmanship.”
Anthony slammed the disapproval of work project funding as a “sloppy, politically irresponsible and dare I say, corrupt action” by House Republicans in her opening remarks to the committee. 
“It’s bad fiscal policy and terrible governance. What does this say about our reputation as a state?” she said. “Let me be absolutely clear, as the chair of this committee, I will fight and use every tool available, legislation, negotiations, the budget process, to work with my colleagues and the governor to restore these funds and protect the integrity of our budget process.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Breaking with party leadership in the House, Republicans on the committee, especially Sen. John Damoose (R-Harbor Springs), criticized the process used to disapprove of these grants, especially one to Rx Kids, a cash payment program for new parents. 
“Basically what happened was a procedural technicality that was exploited to cancel the funds that weren’t spent prior to September 30,” he said.
Damoose told the committee that he worried how this would change spending by grant recipients going forward, saying, “It feels like it creates almost a perverse incentive to blow all the dollars you get immediately.”
Meanwhile, Sen. Jon Bumstead (R-North Muskegon), the committee’s minority vice chair, described the situation as akin to breaking of a contract between Senate Democrats and Republicans. 
House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township), when asked about the critiques at a press conference Tuesday, didn’t mince words, calling Damoose a “Republican budget traitor” who was “pissed off that their pork got cut,” while asserting Bumstead had “cut deals with Democrats” and was “working against his caucus, working against the voters that trusted Republicans with elections.”

Communities, advocates rally at Capitol over lost funding
While lawmakers were discussing the cuts inside the Capitol, a group of community organizers, Democratic state lawmakers and individuals impacted by the cuts gathered on the Capitol’s west steps, chastising House Republicans for eliminating the funding.
Barbara Winter, a member of the Hazel Park Library Board, said their district library was promised $200,000 to replace its elevator to meet the state’s updated elevator safety standards.
The elevator has already been ordered, and is expected to be delivered in February, Winter said. While the community has invested nearly $170,000 of funding in the project, the decision to eliminate the funding for this program has created more issues for the library. 
“If the funding is pulled, we can’t install the elevator. Our building will not be ADA compliant, and we risk legal troubles,” Winter said. “We’ve been forced to close off top floors and shrink services, meaning fewer programs [and]limited access for people who need it most.”










How do we sit down and negotiate and come to an agreement if I have no trust as to what happens after that?


– Sen. Veronica Klinefelt (D-Eastpointe) on the decision by Michigan House Republicans to retroactively cut nearly $645 million in state work grants.


State Rep. Donavan McKinney (D-Detroit), a member of the House Appropriations Committee, said Democrats “are fed up and tired of these damn Republican games,” and that they are working on a supplemental budget to replace the cut funding. 
“This is deeper than politics, y’all,” McKinney said. “Our babies are being impacted by this. Our most vulnerable communities are being impacted by this.”

Uncertainty looms over next year’s negotiations
Criticisms of the long-term ramifications of last week’s decision to cancel nearly $645 million in work project spending included concerns about how budget negotiations will play out next year. 
“This was such a betrayal to me that I don’t know how to negotiate next year,” Sen. Veronica Klinefelt (D-Eastpointe) expressed. “How do we sit down and negotiate and come to an agreement if I have no trust as to what happens after that?”
Those concerns were also shared by those testifying. Jason Mellema, the superintendent of the Ingham ISD, said, “This is a failure by government. Passing a budget, allowing projects to get them and retracting funding after obligations are made, undermines the contents of the entire budget process.” 
“I see only one path forward is to honor existing obligations,” he continued. 
Many of the nonprofit and government leaders who testified emphasized that the funding cuts were for projects and spending that was already well under way — and would be devastating to lose midway through these projects. 
“These orders were filled in confidence that the funds would be there and cover the cost of awards. Unfortunately, with the actions taken last week by the House of Representatives, we have lost $56,500,” Maggie Varney, the founder and CEO of Wigs for Kids, which provides wigs to children with cancer, said. “We felt caught in the middle and blindsided by the decision to recapture funds. We have done this work for 23 years, and will continue to do our very best to serve the children and families at no cost.”
“We had already hired staff. We had already completed MOUs [memorandums of understanding] with the health systems and organizations that were working with us,” said Ramona Benkert, Dean of the Wayne State University College of Nursing, which lost funding for a program to develop the nursing workforce in Michigan. 
Those testifying, including Chrissie Kemzier, the director of SRSLY Dexter, a nonprofit that works to prevent youth substance abuse, and Benjamin Shuldiner, the superintendent of the Lansing School District, both said that their organizations had not received any outreach from members of the House Appropriations Committee for updates on their ongoing work prior to the funding disapprovals.
When asked by reporters about the lack of outreach prior to the cuts, Hall indicated that wasn’t their concern.
“I don’t think that our caucus has a responsibility to reach out to these groups,” Hall said.
However, Brandy Johnson, the president of the Michigan Community College Association, told the committee the process was inherently unfair.
“The rules of the game shouldn’t have been changed midstream or applied retroactively,” Johnson said.
Under the same law that House Republicans used to cancel funding, Anthony and her committee could have disapproved further work project funding up until Dec. 14. However, Anthony said in a press conference earlier in the day that she “would never weaponize the Senate Appropriations Committee for retaliation.

Georgia Department of Corrections.The execution of a Georgia man convicted of murdering two Cobb County women in 2003 has been delayed amid questions of conflicts of interest among the state Board of Pardons and Paroles.
In 2007, a jury found Stacey Humphreys, now 52, guilty of the kidnapping, robbery, assault and murder of Cindy Williams and Lori Brown, real estate agents working out of a model home in a new subdivision. Prosecutors said he ordered the women to strip and tell him their PINs before killing them and withdrawing money from their bank accounts.
The trial took place in Glynn County instead of Cobb because of pretrial publicity.
Humphreys’ execution was scheduled for Dec. 17, but on Monday, Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles Chair Joyette Holmes signed an order suspending the execution without setting a new date. Holmes did not give a reason for the suspension in the order.
The current execution warrant expires Dec. 24, so if the stay remains in effect past that date, the state will need to acquire a new warrant.
Holmes’ order came shortly before an emergency hearing before Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney over whether two members of the pardons board should be allowed to participate in a clemency hearing that had been scheduled for Tuesday but was also suspended by Holmes.
Board member Kim McCoy was appointed to her position by Gov. Brian Kemp at the beginning of December. Previously, she was director of the victim witness unit for the Cobb County district attorney’s office from 1999 to April 2024, where she helped victims and their families, including the families of Williams and Brown.
McCoy told McBurney she had not discussed her involvement with the Humphreys case with other board members, but she did talk about it with the board’s executive director and legal counsel as well as the office of Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr. She said in court that those conversations led her to decide to abstain from Tuesday’s scheduled hearing.
McBurney indicated he did see the potential for an appearance of a conflict of interest in McCoy’s participation.
“A lay person who sat through the trial in Glynn County, day after day, seeing Ms. McCoy do the amazing work that a victim advocate does, not with the defendant, but with the families of the victims, then seeing Ms. McCoy in the room for a clemency hearing, that neutral observer would say, how is this the right way to do things? And it doesn’t impute anything to Ms. McCoy, just on the surface, it speaks of conflict,” he said.
Paroles Board Vice Chair Wayne Bennett previously served as sheriff of Glynn County from 1992 to 2012, including during Humphreys’ trial. Bennett told McBurney his department was involved with managing the jury, housing Humphreys and transporting him to and from the courthouse, but he had no personal interaction with the man.
“At that particular time, we were housing in excess of 400 inmates,” he said. “I had very little one-on-one contact with the inmates, especially the inmates that were in a high custody unit.”
Bennett, who was appointed by the governor in 2024, testified that he had never declared a conflict of interest during his tenure and indicated that he did not intend to in Humphreys’ case.
A grant of commutation requires the approval of three of the five members of the board, and Humphreys’ attorneys argued that he should be entitled to a vote from a full board with no conflicts of interest.",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/humphreys-mug-blurred.jpg,,,2025-12-16 14:56:46.687927

This is the second time in as many years that social media restrictions challenged by NetChoice have been halted by a federal judge.
The law blocked Monday, Act 901 of 2025, allows parents to sue social media platforms if exposure to content on their sites results in their child developing eating disorders, committing or attempting suicide, or becoming addicted to the platform’s feeds.
Internet group files another federal suit over Arkansas social media laws

NetChoice filed a lawsuit against the state in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Arkansas in June. The organization’s June lawsuit challenged Act 901 and another law that amended a 2023 social media law that was permanently blocked this year.
The group argued the two laws violated the First Amendment and are preempted by the federal Communications Decency Act, which protects online service providers from being sued for content created by users. 
NetChoice filed motion for a preliminary injunction on Act 901 in July, which U.S. District Judge Timothy Brooks granted Monday. In the 33-page order, Brooks argued that Act 901’s restrictions on “addictive” algorithms are likely unconstitutional.
“If a social media platform was a library, banning algorithms would be roughly equivalent to requiring books be placed on shelves at random,” Brooks wrote. “Such a prohibition would burden users’ (or library patrons’) First Amendment rights by making it significantly more difficult to access speech a user wishes to receive, so a state probably could not constitutionally ban algorithms for the organization of speech (on social media or elsewhere) altogether.”
NetChoice said in a Tuesday statement that it’s confident the law will be struck down permanently as the case moves forward. Paul Taske, co-director of the NetChoice Litigation Center, called the decision “a win for free speech.”
“It is also a signal to lawmakers across the country—including on Capitol Hill—that laws imposing liability on social media for displaying fully protected speech are unconstitutional,” Taske said in the statement. “To be successful, laws intended to protect Americans online must respect the First Amendment. Otherwise, they will not protect anyone.” 
Jeff LeMaster, a spokesperson for Attorney General Tim Griffin who is representing the state in the case, said they “are disappointed by the ruling and will continue to vigorously defend Act 901.”
Other states implementing social media laws like Arkansas have also faced legal challenges, including Florida, Georgia and Ohio.

Both of Montana’s U.S. representatives, voted for the bill, which will extend funding through the 2026 fiscal year and provide payments from the last two years, after Congress allowed the program to lapse in 2023.
“Montana’s students and teachers lost out on millions in funding when Congress failed to reauthorize the Secure Rural Schools Program,” Rep. Troy Downing said in a statement. “As a former educator, I understand that every penny counts when it comes to the classroom. I was proud to support this measure today that ensures rural communities in central and eastern Montana have the funds they need to provide the best education for our next generation.”
Since 2000, the SRS program has helped rural counties with large swaths of public, tax-exempt federally-owned forest land. The federal government, through the U.S. Forest Service, has a funding formula to share 25% of revenue generated on federal land based on economic activity, timber harvest levels and other considerations that vary by county, with payments going toward rural schools, road maintenance and other programs that serve the counties.
Earlier this year, a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers sent a letter to House leadership seeking urgent reauthorization of the “SRS,” which provided 32 Montana counties with $16 million from the U.S. Forest Service in 2023.
All four members of Montana’s federal delegation signed on to the letter seeking the funding as a standalone measure or attached to broad, year-end funding legislation.
A funding bill co-sponsored by Montana Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy, passed the Senate in  June, though the House didn’t take up a vote until last week.
With the passage of the reauthorization bill, counties are expected to receive payments for 2024 and 2025 within 45 days.
“Passage of the Secure Rural Schools Reauthorization Act is a major win for counties and a milestone in advancing county policy priorities,” Executive Director of the National Association of Counties Matthew Chase said in a statement. “This bill provides critical relief to timber-dependent counties that rely on these funds to maintain essential services and transition toward long-term fiscal stability.”
In Montana, Northwest counties, the heart of the once dominant timber industry, receive the most money.

(Leah Romero for Source New Mexico)Representatives from law enforcement, public schools, state agencies and beyond voiced frustrations Monday about how the state is addressing juvenile crime during legislative Republicans’ latest task force meeting.
GOP lawmakers convened in Las Cruces for the second meeting focused on public safety, this time specifically juvenile crime and the upcoming 30-day regular legislative session. Legislative Republicans recently asked Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham to include public safety on her call for the budgetary session starting Jan. 20, and released a report of findings and legislative priorities.
The governor criticized lawmakers at the end of the 2025 session for not adequately addressing crime in the state, particularly juvenile crime. Her comments followed a fatal mass shooting involving teenagers in a public Las Cruces park the evening before the end of the session.
Left to right: State Rep. Nichole Chavez (R-Albuquerque) and Sen. Crystal Brantley (R-Elephant Butte). Legislative Republicans held their second public safety task force dec. 15, 2025 in Las Cruces.
“Our responsibility as lawmakers is not to protect a system, but to protect people,” Sen. Crystal Brantley (R-Elephant Butte), co-chair of the task force, said during Monday’s meeting. “Let me be clear: Victims must come first. Public safety must matter.”
Las Cruces Police Chief Jeremy Story told the task force that juvenile crime numbers are increasing throughout the state; guns have become like an “accessory” for teens; and attitudes around violence have changed. He went on to say his department has seen increasing trends of minors possessing and “posing” with guns and recording criminal behavior for social media clout; online arguments involving gangs, drugs and money; in-person altercations stemming from “perceived disrespect;” drive-by shootings; and homicides. 
During the task force’s first meeting earlier this month, the governor’s public safety advisor, Benjamin Baker, told attendees that a child or teenager will be arrested and charged with possessing a firearm on three out of four days in New Mexico.
Story added that his department has found that repeat juvenile offenders know they can rig a criminal competency test and the charges against them will likely be dropped. He gave an example of two teens talking over the prison phone, which is recorded, and bragging about purposely failing puzzles and questions posed to them during previous competency tests. 
“There is definitely a separation between what happens in the state competency system and what happens in the federal competency system,” Story said. He added that law enforcement departments are relying now on the federal justice system to hold young people accountable for crimes. “People are malingering and beating the system on the state side.”
Farmington Police Chief Steve Hebbe told the task force that the issues law enforcement faces in holding juveniles accountable stem from the actions of the state Legislature. 
“If we’re responsible for community safety and we’re facing these problems, all we can do is come to the Legislature and say, ‘Here’s what we’re seeing, we need help,’” Hebbe said. “We just haven’t gotten it and it’s been very frustrating.”
Hebbe told Source New Mexico that he believes New Mexico needs to look at what works in the federal competency system and how it can be implemented at the state level to ensure young people are held accountable. He also said he wants to see more collaboration between the Children, Youth and Families Department and law enforcement to identify children and families struggling so they can provide resources.
“By the time we’re seeing them at the police level, the problem’s out of control…Then we’re not holding the kids accountable, so they’re going back into the same environment that got them there in the first place,” Hebbe said. “We need more severe consequences — we need consequences earlier. It begins to change the mentality.”
Brantley said that while touring the two juvenile correctional facilities in the state over the summer, staff told her that children need more time in the facilities to further their rehabilitation and set them up for success outside.
“Instead of keeping them there longer where we can give them the education, put them on workforce track, give them the mental health [support] that they need, the substance abuse, we just open the gates,” Brantley said, “because some people that we serve with don’t believe it’s compassionate to keep these kids behind bars. And I will tell you, it’s inhumane to let them out. You are returning them to a life of violence.”
The task force also agreed on several legislative proposals including addressing chronic absenteeism in school to correct behavior; expanding what falls under serious youthful offenses; updating the tool used to determine whether juveniles should be detained or released prior to  their court appearances; extending the court’s jurisdiction over juvenile offenders to age 25; and allowing juvenile records to be used in pre-sentence detention hearings, disposition hearings and sentencing hearings.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/storyandhebbe-1024x683.png,,,2025-12-16 14:56:46.687927

(Photo by Kevin Mohatt/Colorado Newsline)A measure backed by a conservative dark-money group proposing tougher penalties on fentanyl possession and distribution will appear on Colorado’s 2026 ballot, the secretary of state’s office announced.
Initiative 85 is the first measure to qualify for the 2026 ballot. It’s backed by Advance Colorado, a conservative nonprofit advocacy group that does not disclose its donors. Supporters last month said they had turned in more than 180,000 petition signatures for the measure, and state elections officials confirmed Monday that the group had submitted the 124,238 valid signatures required to place a statutory initiative on the statewide ballot.
The measure would make the possession of any amount of fentanyl a felony, further rolling back a bipartisan drug policy reform passed by Colorado lawmakers in 2019. It would also mandate harsher penalties for the “distribution, manufacturing, dispensing, or sale” of fentanyl.

“Fentanyl remains the single biggest public health issue facing our state,” John Kellner, said in a statement posted to social media by Advance Colorado. “While steps were taken at the state Capitol to try and address the situation, those steps did not go nearly far enough.”
An estimated 790 people died from a synthetic opioid overdose in Colorado in 2024. Consistent with national trends, that figure represented a substantial drop from peak levels in the previous few years, though it’s still higher than the rates of overdose deaths prior to 2020.
Colorado lawmakers in 2019 passed a law, House Bill 19-1263, reducing the possession of less than 4 grams of most controlled substances from a felony to a misdemeanor, a change that supporters, including the Colorado Criminal Justice Reform Coalition, at the time called a “step toward treating drug use as a matter of public health rather than criminal justice.” The bill was cosponsored by two Republicans, former state Sen. Vicki Marble of Fort Collins and Rep. Shane Sandridge of Colorado Springs.
It was signed into law just as overdoses from synthetic opioids like fentanyl were surging. Public health researchers attribute the surge in large part to the aggressive crackdown on the supply of opioid medications like OxyContin in response to the 2010s opioid crisis, which led dealers and people with substance use disorders to seek alternatives. Because of their high potency in extremely small doses — fentanyl is used in medical settings in amounts measured in micrograms — synthetic opioids are much more dangerous to users of illicit drugs. A counterfeit pill containing as little as 2 milligrams of fentanyl can lead to a fatal overdose.
The alarming increase in fentanyl overdoses also gave rise to widespread myths and misconceptions about the drug. Police officers, including some in Colorado, have routinely claimed to have been affected by “passive exposure” to aerosolized fentanyl powder, which toxicologists say is pharmacologically impossible. Law enforcement figures and conservative politicians also frequently make wildly exaggerated claims about the number of fatal fentanyl doses seized in drug busts, by confusing the “compound weights” of seized pills containing fentanyl for pure fentanyl in its powder form. Such misinformation risks harming people in need of emergency treatment by making bystanders and first responders more hesitant to intervene, according to medical experts.
Under pressure from prosecutors and law enforcement officials, state lawmakers in 2022 rolled back HB-1263 and made possession of more than 1 gram of any compound containing fentanyl — roughly as little as 10 counterfeit opioid pills — a felony again.
As a statutory measure, Initiative 85, which will receive a new proposition number when it appears on ballots in November, would need a simple majority to pass.

DMC Huron Valley-Sinai Hospital in Commerce Township was listed by county officials as a potential exposure site, specifically for individuals who were in the emergency department on the evening of Dec. 7.
Oakland County confirmed its first measles case of the year in June. Throughout the state, this marks the 30th case in Michigan in 2025, according to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. 
Nationally, the United States has seen over 1,900 measles cases, the highest number since 1992. Childhood vaccination rates are continuing to decline, especially as Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who, despite saying in April that the measles vaccine was effective, had historically cast doubt on the vaccine and tied it to autism, a link that is not backed up by science and has been repeatedly disproven. 
This has led some governors, including Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, to enact policies allowing for state-level officials to issue their own vaccine guidance. 
“Vaccination is the most effective tool we have to prevent the spread of measles,” said Kate Guzman, the Oakland County health officer, in the county’s press release announcing the confirmed case. “The measles (MMR) vaccine helps protect our community’s most vulnerable which includes infants, children with medical conditions, and others who cannot be vaccinated.”

Planning for the future is guided by conversation and the belief that every person deserves a path that works for them. As you connect with others during the winter break, keep in mind that (fortunately) Vermont offers great options to help bring every student’s goals to life.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Honoring all paths: Tips for talking with stude[...]","Winter break offers a welcome chance to slow down, reconnect with friends and family, and—most importantly—rest. These quieter moments often create space for deeper conversations we may not have the time for during busier times, including discussions about interests, goals, and aspirations. 
Those conversations can naturally lead to important reflections on the future. Fortunately, there are many affordable, flexible ways for students of all ages to learn and train for careers after high school. Eligible students can leverage 802Opportunity for free tuition at Community College of Vermont. New this year, Freedom & Unity offers qualifying students free tuition at Vermont State University. And students may also take advantage of VSAC’s workforce development programs, providing free training in the trades and other critical-need jobs in exchange for a work commitment in Vermont. 
Start Conversations with Curiosity 
Often, the most meaningful moments begin with simple curiosity and a willingness to listen. These conversations don’t need to be formal or structured! Whether you’re catching up with a teen, talking with a neighbor who’s exploring a career change, or chatting with a college student who is home for the holidays, your encouragement and interest make a difference.
Consider asking questions that invite reflection and might open the door to deeper understanding. Can you think of questions that invite more than a yes or no answer?

That’s interesting. Tell me more about why you’re curious about that.
You’ve clearly thought about that. How did you get there?
How (or where) did you learn about that?
Who influenced your interest?
What made you explore this?

Self-reflection questions can also inspire deeper conversations:

What are the things you most enjoy doing with family or friends?
When are you working at your best?
What kinds of jobs do the people you admire most have?
What about yourself are you most proud of?
What excites you when you think about what comes next?

As you invite these conversations, engage with intention: listen actively, share authentically, and seek to understand. Your genuine interest can help someone feel seen and supported—and open the door to new possibilities. And if you have a chance, you might also share information about concrete options the student may want to explore.
Highlight Real Options
The sheer number of opportunities out there today for students can feel overwhelming. The great news for students and families is that Vermont offers several exceptional pathways designed to support learners of all ages and interests, and from all backgrounds. 
802Opportunity: Free Tuition at Community College of Vermont
Vermont residents with a family income of $100,000 or less who do not have a bachelor’s degree can attend Community College of Vermont tuition-free with 802Opportunity.  For students seeking flexible learning that fits around work, family, or other commitments, the program offers more than 30 certificate and associate degree programs with day or evening classes, part-time or full-time enrollment, and in-person or online formats.
Freedom & Unity: Free Tuition at Vermont State University 
Freedom & Unity allows Vermont students with a family income of $65,000 or less who do not have a bachelor’s degree to attend Vermont State University tuition-free. With more than 100 campus-based, hybrid, and online programs leading to associate or bachelor’s degrees, it’s a strong option for students interested in fields like education, engineering, or entrepreneurship.
Funding for Workforce Development: Free Skill-Based Training
Vermont’s Workforce Development Funding helps learners pursue high-demand careers across the state. Funding is currently available for training in skilled trades and dental hygiene. Workforce Development Funding also supports certain graduate-level programs, including the Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioner and Nurse Faculty pathways.
In addition, the Vermont National Guard Tuition Benefit Program will pay some or all of the tuition for a student who enrolls in Guard Service while in school.   
These workforce development programs are structured as interest-free loans, but with a big difference: if you complete your program or service and work in Vermont in your field for a set amount of time, your loan will be fully forgiven. No repayment. No interest. Just the support to launch your future. 
All People, All Paths
There is a path for everyone, whether they’re drawn to hands-on work, public service, creative fields, community leadership, graduate-level careers, or stepping-stone programs that help them get started or build on job experience or credits already earned.
As you connect with others during the winter break, remember that planning for the future happens together, over time. It’s an intention kindled by conversation, encouragement, and the shared belief that every person deserves a path that fits who they are and who they aspire to be.
A single conversation could be what helps someone take their next step with confidence. Why not let that spark ignite with you?
The Vermont Student Assistance Corp. was created by the Vermont Legislature in 1965 as a public nonprofit agency. We advocate for Vermont students and their families to ensure that they have the tools they need to achieve their education and training goals.

(Photo by Frank van Manen/USGS)A federal judge halted a large logging project near Yellowstone National Park because he said the United States Forest Service submitted plans that made it impossible to judge how it would affect critical grizzly bear habitat.
The 16,500-acre project located in the Custer Gallatin National Forest would have allowed the U.S. Forest Service to select timber and build roads for logging. But without offering specifics, the project only pledged that its plans would consider the total distance of the roads and not exceed certain parameters in acreage size, designed to protect critical bear habitat.
Interior announces increased new fees on international visitors to national parks

However, Judge Donald W. Molloy said that the plans amounted to giving the Forest Service permission and trusting that it would be compliant later. He also said in a 46-page ruling released Thursday that the plans also made it difficult to judge how the logging project would impact grizzly habitat, and that U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said a female grizzly’s minimum range was 10 acres, while not basing that decision on any cited science.
Meanwhile the groups that challenged the logging project, the Center for Biological Diversity, the Alliance for the Wild Rockies, Wild Earth Guardians and the Western Environmental Law Center, pointed to other research that indicated as many as 2,500 acres were needed.

 Judge rules Forest Service project doesn’t comply with National Forest Management Act

Molloy also vacated the Forest Service’s project because it failed to comply with several different portions of federal law, including the National Forest Management Act.
“(The groups) argue that this approach conflates a promise of future statutory compliance with actual compliance. (They) insist that it is impossible to assess the true environmental impacts of the project under the National Environmental Policy Act, or determine whether it meets statutory or forest plan protections for grizzly bears and lynx under the Endangered Species Act and the NFMA,” Molloy said.
The judge agreed the Forest Service failed to properly consider the impacts of the logging project on the grizzly bears. While the Forest Service, in its plans, said that it would be approving 56.8 miles of temporary roads associated with the project, it said those would be determined during the project, based on other conditions.
However, the groups had argued one of the biggest factors in grizzly bear habitats is their proximity to roads. Grizzly bears, according to the scientific testimony presented in the case, tend to avoid and settle in habitats far away from roads, and that humans are the largest threat to grizzly bear survival.
In the lawsuit, the groups argued it wasn’t just the total number or length of the roads that mattered, but also the placement. Because the Forest Service plans gave no specifics on the location of the roads, Molloy said it was impossible to judge the impacts on the bears.
“Essentially while the Forest Service’s math check out, it is unclear how the Forest Service can calculate the amount of secure habitat that will be lost without first determining where the temporary roads will be routed,” Molloy said in his ruling.
 Environmental groups celebrate ruling on logging project

Furthermore, the judge agreed that approving the project would have meant the true extent of the project could not be calculated until after the project, leaving the groups with few legal remedies.
“Here, however in the context of grizzly bear secure habitation, the lack of specific road mapping prevents such informed decision making,” Molloy said. “The Forest Service avowing that future activities will comply with NFMA falls far short of showing that those actives do so.”
The court also said the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service relied on using a grizzly 10-acre patch size for habitat was consistent, but officials provided no science or basis for that size, while the groups cited other scientific research that calls for much more, and highlights the importance of that land in relation to roads for motorized vehicles.
“The U.S. Forest Service identify no specific explanation of why 10 acres, as opposed to 1 acre, 5 acres or 50 acres is an appropriate metric,” Molloy said.
The conservation groups cheered the ruling.
“This ruling makes it clear that agencies can’t just rubber-stamp massive logging projects and promise to sort out the details later,” said Kristine Akland, Northern Rockies director and senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity. “The court saw right through the Forest Service’s vague plans and determined that moving targets aren’t good enough, especially when threatened animals and treasured public lands are at stake.”

There is no problem with (revealing) sources and methods” because the senators will view it in the Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility, a secure area of the Capitol where classified information is generally shared.Schumer added that an “appropriate version” of the video should be disclosed to the public.Senate Republicans downplayed loud concerns from Democrats, pointing to former President Barack Obama’s numerous counterterrorism drone strikes in the Middle East.“We've been using the same technique for 24 years, and nothing has changed except the hemisphere,” said Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla.Public release called forHegseth told reporters the unedited video will be shown to members of the Senate and House committees on the Armed Services Wednesday, alongside Admiral Frank Bradley, commander of U.S. Special Operations Command, who oversaw the strikes.Hegseth did not address why the department declined to show the unedited video to all 100 senators. He did say, “Of course, we're not going to release a top-secret, full, unedited video of that to the general public.”Several Democratic senators have called for the video to be publicly released.Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., said he was told during the meeting that the video won’t be released because of “classification concerns.”“It is hard to square the widespread, routine, prompt posting of detailed videos of every strike, with a concern that posting a portion of the video of the first strike would violate a variety of classification concerns,” Coons said.Coons added “it’s increasingly important that the national security team of the Trump administration increasingly respect and recognize the role and power of Congress.” He highlighted a provision in Congress’s annual defense authorization bill that compels Hegseth to release the video or lose 25% of his travel budget. The massive defense bill is expected to pass this week.Body count from boat strikes risingU.S. Southern Command posted a video on social media Monday night of the military’s latest strikes on three boats “operated by Designated Terrorist Organizations in international waters” in the eastern Pacific. The strikes killed eight people, according to the post.President Donald Trump has officially promoted his military actions in the Caribbean as a fight against drug trafficking and overdose deaths in the United States, particularly from illicit fentanyl. On Monday Trump issued an order declaring the powerful synthetic opioid as a “Weapon of Mass Destruction.”The smuggling routes for illicit fentanyl and the chemicals used to make it follow the path from China to Mexico to the U.S., and is highlighted as such in the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency’s 2025 National Drug Threat Assessment.The administration has designated several drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, including “Cartel de los Soles,” an alleged Venezuelan group that the Department of State described as spearheaded by Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.Trump has hinted at a land invasion of the South American country.When asked by States Newsroom on Tuesday whether Hegseth addressed during the meeting what type of drugs were alleged to be in the targeted boats, Mullin and Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, said cocaine.“We've always heard it’s mainly cocaine. It doesn't matter. It's drugs,” Mullin said.Sullivan said “it’s the same groups” smuggling the cocaine as the ones smuggling fentanyl.Cocaine mixed with illicit fentanyl has become “an increasing public safety concern” over the last eight years, according to the National Drug Threat Assessment. Overall, all U.S. drug overdose deaths have decreased in recent years, according to the assessment and latest data published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-12-16 14:56:46.687927

Sept. 12, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska’s general fund tax receipts for November grew modestly above recent projections, but it may not help fill the budget hole state lawmakers are tasked with filling in January.
Nebraska’s November tax receipts show a net growth of 3.1% over what Nebraska’s Economic Forecasting Advisory Board predicted in October, according to the state Department of Revenue.
That equates to just under $18 million in extra revenue into the state’s coffers. However, Legislative Fiscal Analyst Keisha Patent said those dollars won’t go directly into Nebraska’s general fund.
By state statute, the extra revenue will go into the state’s cash reserve or the School District Property Tax Relief Credit Fund, depending on how much the amount ends up above forecasts.
Nebraska’s projected budget deficit currently stands at $471 million, which lawmakers are tasked with filling before the 2026 legislative session concludes. Lawmakers grappled with a fluctuating budget shortfall that at one point grew to $432 million during the 90-day session this spring.
Most specific tax revenues came in modestly above projections, including individual income taxes, sales and use taxes and miscellaneous taxes. The sole outlier was corporate income taxes, which came in roughly 78% below forecasts.

Patent said she wasn’t sure why corporate income taxes came in low, but noted the corporate tax returns tracked with October’s general fund receipts. She said she expects corporate tax revenues will bounce back in December, as historically the month has brought in high revenues for the state.
State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood, who chairs the Nebraska Legislature’s Appropriations Committee, said he was “encouraged” by November’s tax receipts, calling it a signal that Neraska’s economy is stable.
As for how the additional revenue will impact the budget deficit, Clements said he is open to using rainy day funds to fill the shortfall, but he expects he and other lawmakers will be stingier with the cash reserve compared to other funds.
Nebraska’s cash reserve is estimated to be at about $669 million by the end of the current budget cycle.
Last year, Gov. Jim Pillen’s budget proposal and state lawmakers swept funding from dozens of different cash funds in order to fill the projected deficit, but Clements said some cash funds were unaffected.
Those may be tapped in 2026, he said.

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)Seven in 10 North Dakota Farmers Union agriculture producers will be affected by Affordable Care Act subsidies that expire at the end of the year, an official with the organization warned members this month.
Lance Boyer, sales director of financial products for the North Dakota Farmers Union, said the enhanced tax credits that were part of the American Rescue Plan Act approved in 2021 brought down health insurance premiums for members. 
After the tax credits took effect, the North Dakota Farmers Union saw people who had previously been uninsured buy health insurance policies, he said.
With the subsidies set to expire unless Congress votes to extend them, Boyer said federal lawmakers haven’t focused enough on the self-employed farmers who will find it difficult to pay for increased health insurance premiums.
“The bulk of the people that are going to be impacted are hard-working folks,” Boyer said during a breakout session at the organization’s annual convention in Bismarck on Friday. 
No US House vote to extend health care subsidies, Speaker Johnson says

For example, Boyer cited a married couple in their 30s who earn between $50,000 and $60,000 a year and have a daughter. They expect to see health insurance premiums increase $300 per month next year. 
“On $50,000 to $60,000 a year, where do you find $4,000 a year in your budget?” Boyer said. “What are you going to go without?”
In another example, he said a member family of four earning about $150,000 per year pays about $900 for health insurance per month this year. The family expects to see the premium increase to $2,900 per month.
“People are going to walk away from their health insurance,” Boyer said. “I’ve never seen a time in this business like I am seeing today.”
Nationally, 27% of farmers, ranchers and agricultural managers are insured by individual marketplace insurance policies, with the large majority purchased through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, according to health policy outlet KFF.
The North Dakota Farm Bureau has seen an increase in people interested in its health plans as an alternative to the Affordable Care Act marketplace insurance, said Megan Hanson, director of member relations and state health plans manager.
Those plans, offered through a 10-state Farm Bureau group compact, can offer higher deductibles, differing out-of-pocket expenses and lower premiums than typical insurance plans, Hanson said. The plans do not cover people with preexisting conditions, such as cancer or diabetes, and can require people to submit medical records when they apply for coverage, she said.
John Arnold, deputy commissioner for the North Dakota Insurance and Securities Department, advises people to consider the big picture when evaluating different insurance or health coverage plans.
“The monthly premium may be significantly lower, but over the course of the year, am I going to be paying more out-of-pocket, one way or the other?” Arnold said. “Definitely encourage consumers to look beyond the initial sticker price, do all their calculations and figure out what plan is best for them.”
Arnold said the best thing people shopping for health coverage can do is to talk to their local insurance agents to become more informed about their options. He said the agents should be able to explain the policies and options clearly so people don’t fall victim to plans they don’t fully understand.
“There is no alternative to sitting across the desk, face-to-face, talking to somebody who knows the industry inside and out,” he said.
Open enrollment for Affordable Care Act marketplace health insurance plans runs through Jan. 15.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — An education software will now include the language of the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, Chahta anumpa, following a partnership with the tribal nation. 
The Choctaw Nation announced the partnership with Rosetta Stone on Tuesday in an effort to preserve the tribal language. 
“When we speak Chahta, our ancestors speak through us. Sharing our language ensures their voices will never fade,” Chief Gary Batton said in a statement. “Each word spoken is the core that strengthens our families and our culture, and secures our identity as the Chahta people. This partnership to share our language is more than a program. It is an act of love for our people and a promise to keep our culture alive for generations to come.” 
The number of fluent speakers has “sharply declined” and this was accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a news release. Learning the language will be more accessible to all Choctaw citizens and allow them to stay connected to their roots. 
Chahta anumpa will be part of Rosetta Stone’s Endangered Languages Program which focuses on recording and teaching “at-risk” languages. Over the past 20 years, Rosetta Stone has worked to help preserve several Indigenous languages. 
“Language is deeply personal. It connects us to family, history and place,” said Paul Mishkin, CEO of IXL Learning, Rosetta Stone’s parent company. “Through our Endangered Languages Program, we’re honored to work alongside the Choctaw Nation to protect not just words, but the identities and cultures they carry.”
The program maps the “building blocks” of the language and works with the community to build curriculum, according to the Rosetta Stone website. The partnerships are “multi-year commitments” and the learning programs are available for use by tribal members.

U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) announced Dec. 16, 2025 that he is once again pushing for legislation authorizing up to $14 million annually to help tribes build and expand buffalo herds across the country. 
(Jerry Driendl/Getty Images)U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-NM) announced Tuesday he is reintroducing legislation to improve federal support for tribal buffalo herds, an effort he said he hopes will return the buffalo within his lifetime “to the prominent place they once occupied as the keystone species on American shortgrass prairies.” 
Co-sponsored with U.S. Sen. Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.,), the Indian Buffalo Management Act directs the federal Interior Department to work with tribes to develop, protect and grow buffalo tribes across the country, authorizing up to $14 million annually. The bill seeks to spur more coordination and consistent investment at the Interior Department, which has provided only “nominal” funds over the last 20 years to tribes that want to start or expand buffalo herds, according to a news release from Heinrich’s office. 
The InterTribal Buffalo Council, which has been pushing to return buffalo to tribal land for more than 30 years, endorsed the legislation. The council has 89 tribal members in 22 states, including at least 10 New Mexico tribes and pueblos, according to a recent membership list. 
“Helping Tribes reestablish herds of buffalo on our reservations is a righteous thing for the Congress to do and will be thoroughly welcomed by Tribes and Indian people across the county,” council leaders, including Delbert Chisholm of Taos Pueblo, said in a statement. 
Heinrich introduces a bill to help tribes better manage buffalo herds

At least 60 million buffalo once roamed throughout much of the United States before European settlers and the United States military destroyed all but a few hundred by the end of the 18th century. Indigenous people relied on the buffalo — “culturally and nutritionally” — for thousands of years, according to the council leaders’ statement. 
Versions of the legislation have passed either the House of Representatives or the Senate, but not both, in recent years. Heinrich and Mullin (R-Okla.) also cosponsored the bill last year, and it passed the Senate in December but never received a hearing in the House.
“I’m proud to reintroduce this bipartisan legislation to strengthen federal support for Tribal buffalo programs and continue the growth of Tribal buffalo herds,” Heinrich said in a statement. “I look forward to continuing to work with Senator Mullin to strengthen this federal partnership and secure future funding for this initiative.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/BisonGettyImages-200421265-001-1024x816.jpg,,,2025-12-16 13:56:59.066671

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)In late November, FEMA sent North Carolina officials a memo outlining a shift in how the agency would process existing applications for Hurricane Helene aid, some of which have been pending for months already. 
FEMA’s new strategy, according to the document, was designed to “accelerate the recovery process” and “ensure accountability” for its sprawling Public Assistance program. It would change how the agency reviews and approves hundreds of millions in disaster recovery money.
Two weeks later, North Carolina’s emergency management director sent a response that raised issues with almost every step of the plan. 
The state had “significant concerns” with FEMA’s new process: it failed to address the most cumbersome aspects of Public Assistance, “lacked clarity” on dates and details, and imposed stricter deadlines on the state and local communities without similar guidelines for the agency itself.
“The proposed strategy seems to prioritize incomplete administrative measures over truly improving recovery efforts,” wrote William Ray, the state’s emergency management director.
The group representing county governments in western North Carolina was even more explicit in its criticisms. In a separate letter, the executive director of the N.C. Association of County Commissioners said the FEMA plan was “unhelpful” and was “tying one hand behind [our] backs.” 
“At a minimum, this news is disappointing,” wrote Kevin Leonard, in a letter to Ray that was also passed on to Rob Ashe, the acting administrator for FEMA’s southeast region. “At a maximum, this news has been received by some as if FEMA leadership at the regional and Washington, D.C. level is tone deaf.”
And in another letter to Ray, the director of the N.C. League of Municipalities said the new guidance would “require the most of the smallest municipalities in the region.”
The correspondence represents the latest point of contention between FEMA and North Carolina leaders as they continue to work on Helene recovery, more than a year after the storm. 
The agency continues to send a steady trickle of aid to North Carolina through the Public Assistance program, now totaling over $1 billion for the storm. But state and local officials alike have repeatedly expressed frustration with new bureaucratic obstacles in FEMA’s process, which have kept governments on uncertain ground and forced delays in other grant programs.
As of this week, FEMA has “not implemented many of those policies” outlined in the memo, an emergency management staffer told Gov. Josh Stein’s advisory committee for western North Carolina on Monday. 
FEMA, asked for comment on the letters, referred NC Newsline to its latest news release that touts more than $1 billion in total Public Assistance grants for Helene recovery.
“These funds are delivered in accordance with federal requirements to ensure accountability and that eligible costs are reimbursed as quickly as possible,” an unnamed spokesperson said in an email.
Changes to FEMA aid focus on small projects, don’t address long-standing points of frustration
FEMA’s changes to Public Assistance aimed to “reduce the number of open … projects” and “reduce the timeline” for both current and future projects, according to the agency’s memo.
That involved a four-step process that included pushing resources to “high-priority” projects, “streamlining” the process to get documents for a project and “expediting” the review of projects.
Over the next two months, the agency would focus particularly on projects that cost less than $100,000, reviewing applications that are already in the pipeline. That would notably exclude everything that requires the personal sign-off by Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristin Noem; FEMA rules require her to approve every payment over $100,000.
By the end of January, the agency will have approved an estimated $26.2 million for projects in the southeast region, according to the memo.
Absent from the plan, North Carolina officials noted, was anything that would speed up the biggest pending applications, including payments for debris cleanup. And it appeared that FEMA’s new layers of approval, including personal signoff by Noem, would remain unchanged.
Ray, in his letter, called that process “inefficient and bureaucratic.” He also called FEMA’s “Defend the Spend” effort, a separate step led by DOGE, “administratively redundant.” 
Leonard, with the association of county commissioners, pointed out that the goal of $26.2 million was less than “the outstanding debris requirements for just one (among several) of our hardest hit counties.” 
It wasn’t clear how FEMA workers would “prioritize” projects, Ray wrote, and the new steps to request documents clashed with a prior agreement with the state. 
The agency was putting new strict deadlines in place for applicants that would be a particular crunch for smaller towns and cities, wrote N.C. League of Municipalities director Rose Vaughn Williams.
“The new requirements outlined in the FEMA memo, implemented on short notice and requiring a fast turnaround, may be difficult for these communities to comply with,” she wrote.
The memo does not, however, mention new deadlines for FEMA staff. That contrast contributed to a “trust deficit that has been building for several months” between local leaders and the agency, Leonard wrote.
“This continues a pattern that counties have consistently raised for months, including with Col. Ashe during his recent visits: the goalposts keep moving,” Leonard wrote.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_3427-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-16 13:56:59.066671

The federal agency that manages the New Bedford hurricane barrier — and controls which vessels can go in and out — could throw a potentially costly and time-consuming wrench into Vineyard Wind’s ability to ship its final blades out of port. Vineyard Wind’s permit to send ships through the barrier expires Dec. 31, and the agency is still evaluating whether to extend it.
Several years ago, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers issued what’s called a Section 408 authorization to Vineyard Wind, allowing the project to send heavy lift boats and wide barges through the barrier’s 150-foot-wide opening — a delicate maneuver that could be catastrophic if it goes wrong. (To date, it hasn’t.)
The original approval had an end date of Dec. 31, 2024, but the project hit significant turbine installation delays due to the July 2024 blade failure. Vineyard Wind filed for an extension from the Army Corps on Sept. 10, 2024, and received approval the following month, on Oct. 21, 2024. The new deadline: Dec. 31, 2025.
With that day a little more than two weeks away, and one tower and several blades left to install or ship out, it’s unlikely Vineyard Wind will meet the cutoff. Sources who spoke with The Light said they expected the final components to be installed by March.
On Aug. 7 — four months ago — the company filed a second extension request with the Army Corps. It’s still pending.
“While Vineyard Wind’s goal is to reach Project completion in 2025, unexpected supply chain, weather, and other unforeseen delays may occur over the next five months that would preclude completion in 2025,” read the August letter from Vineyard Wind to the Army Corps. “The goal is to reach Project completion by the end of December 2025, however, given the unpredictability of issues that may arise, Vineyard Wind is requesting an extension.”
As of Monday, the Army Corps, which falls under the Department of Defense, has not made a decision to approve or deny it.
“Vineyard Wind has requested an extension, which is currently under consideration. We are unable to speculate on future 408 decisions or their timing,” said Adam Stewart, a spokesperson for the Army Corps New England District office, in a Dec. 9 email to The Light.
The processing time of the second extension request has run more than three times as long to date, or twice as long if the 43-day government shutdown is excluded.
An Army Corps spokesperson would not provide further information, including on whether the agency plans to make a determination by Dec. 31.
In its October 2024 extension approval letter, the Army Corps said it determined that the extension “will not impair the usefulness of the New Bedford Hurricane Barrier, and will not be injurious to the public interest.”
Further, the agency wrote, “If you find that you need more time to complete the authorized activity, submit your request for a time extension to this office for consideration at least one month before the above date is reached.”
Vineyard Wind and GE Vernova declined comment.


Chris Matthews, a spokesperson for U.S. Rep. Bill Keating, said by email that Keating’s office is in “regular contact” and working closely with Vineyard Wind, and that Keating is aware of the pending request before the Army Corps.
Amid Trump’s war on wind, and a day-one wind memo that last week was struck down as illegal by a federal judge, all federal permitting for offshore wind projects has frozen, creating uncertainty over the fate of the Army Corps extension request.
Yet, unlike other offshore wind projects, Vineyard Wind has managed to escape attacks and roadblocks from the Trump administration. While its neighbors on the Outer Continental Shelf, Empire Wind and Revolution Wind, received orders to halt construction (since lifted and overturned, respectively), Vineyard Wind received none and quietly continued buildout.
A possible difference between previously authorized transits through the hurricane barrier and the ones most likely to take place in 2026 is the types of components that will be shipped. Vineyard Wind will (weather permitting) likely ship out its final turbine tower and nacelle by the end of the month, leaving only blades to install next year.
About seven towers do not have blades as of Dec. 9, according to satellite images. Beyond that, some towers may still require blade removal and replacement. According to GIS-enthusiast Joel Stocker, who has been closely mapping the project’s progress, 10 blade sets either need removal or installation.

The barges have already passed through the barrier with different combinations of turbine components, including blades only.
The skilled pilots driving the tugs and barges have made at least 100 successful transits through the barrier without incident. They abide by strict weather and visibility conditions. If the winds are too strong, they delay their departure.
The barrier, built in 1966, protects about 1,400 acres of homes and businesses in New Bedford, Fairhaven, and Acushnet from coastal flooding. Its steel doors close on both water and land, like it did for Tropical Storm Henri in 2021.
A source familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said there’s been talk that if the request is not approved, Vineyard Wind may utilize a Rhode Island port to send out the remaining blades.
That might require the disassembly of large cranes at the New Bedford terminal — and other pieces of the marshaling apparatus — which would take additional time. The 2,000-ton crane came to the New Bedford Marine Commerce Terminal by many truckloads.
The project could also have another option: shipping blades to Canada and having one of the installation vessels, Wind Pace, pick them up there, which it has already been doing for the blade removal and replacement work.
“There is so much uncertainty in the industry right now… it’s a whole new playing field,” the source said. “There’s no stability right now, there’s instability.”

“Independent voters pay taxes, fund public elections, and live with the outcomes of those elections, yet many are locked out of the most consequential contests,” said Andy Moore, a spokesman for the new group. “That’s a modern form of taxation without representation, and it’s a problem worth solving.”
Oklahoma has nearly 2.4 million voters, of which 487,927 are independents.
Emily Hale is an independent from Harrah.
“Most people don’t fit neatly into a red or blue box,” she said. “But our system insists we choose one just to have a voice.”

(Photo courtesy of National Conference of State Legislatures)A new group of bipartisan state legislative leaders issued a declaration at their first meeting calling for a renewed focus on states’ rights and an end to federal intrusion into state laws. 
The Assembly of State Legislative Leaders, which includes more than 40 lawmakers from 30 states, unanimously approved a 449-word declaration on the importance of states’ ability to legislate independently. 
The document, released on Tuesday at the bipartisan group’s inaugural meeting in Columbus, Ohio, noted that the U.S. Constitution did not create the states, “but rather the states created the Constitution, ratifying a framework in which we would both govern collectively and independently.” 
Federalism is a foundational constitutional concept outlining the sharing of power between states and the federal government. 
State lawmakers ask Trump administration to end its review of state regs

The lawmakers’ declaration says federal agency rules, congressional legislation and executive orders must respect the constitutional division of powers and allow states to pass a diverse array of legislation.
The document says adherence to federalism is the key to “restore the balance between the federal government and state legislatures, ensure collaboration that respects state roles and limits unnecessary federal intrusion into state sovereignty.”
It opposes federal preemption of state laws except when “a direct conflict with the Constitution arises or the issue cannot be effectively addressed at the state level.” 
The newly formed group underscores growing tension between the federal government and states. 
Last week, for example, President Donald Trump signed an executive order aiming to override state laws regulating artificial intelligence. State lawmakers of both parties said they will continue to file legislation on the issue and push back on the president’s effort. 
States will keep pushing AI laws despite Trump’s efforts to stop them

The National Conference of State Legislatures, which represents state legislatures and legislative staff across the country, helped organize the new group. NCSL in September wrote to federal leaders, citing bipartisan concern about recent federal actions that the group said attempted to undermine the authority of state governments. It opposed a Trump administration review of state laws believed to be overly burdensome for businesses.
This week in Ohio, state lawmakers discussed a variety of issues related to federalism, including Medicaid, education and land management, according to NCSL. Ohio Republican state House Speaker Matt Huffman was elected as presiding officer of the new assembly, with Hawaii Democratic state Senate President Ron Kouchi elected as recording secretary.
“We have accomplished the first of what I hope is a long list of future declarations from state legislative leaders,” Huffman said in a statement. “This meeting was a first of its kind, and I’m hopeful we will continue these conversations across the nation.”
Kouchi characterized the meeting as “a good beginning.”
“I am pleased the top state legislative leaders from both parties were able to come together and have a candid, practical conversation about how we can better preserve and strengthen the role of the states within our constitutional framework,” he said in the statement.

(Photo by Ryan Murphy/Getty Images)There’s scant evidence that the Trump administration’s intensified immigration enforcement is achieving its objective of removing a significant number of violent criminals. Aside from appealing to the most xenophobic elements of the MAGA crowd, the missions have had negligible practical or symbolic effect. 
In Louisiana, Operation Catahoula Crunch is moving into its third week and appears to be losing steam and support, even among Republicans. Federal authorities have reported nearly 350 arrests, with fewer than 10% of those apprehended having a criminal record. 
Documents the Associated Press obtained ahead of the operation indicated authorities intended to arrest 5,000 people in Southeast Louisiana. At its current pace, the campaign would need six months to reach that goal.
“Is going door to door, pulling people out of their houses and cars, is that the right way to do this?” Lt. Gov. Bill Nungesser told WRKF-FM. “I hope to God it’s not arresting people to reach a quota … I hope that’s not the fact because that has put the fear of God in a lot of people.”
This was Nungesser’s take last week after taking heat from a fellow Republican state leader, Gov. Jeff Landry, for prior comments on the topic of immigration. In a statement to The Times-Picayune, the governor’s office said it was “disappointing” that Nungesser had prioritized concerns for “individuals who enter our country illegally” over American citizens. 
The lieutenant governor, as the state’s top tourism official, said he wants to relay concerns he’s heard from the hospitality industry to Landry.
“I’ve got hotel owners calling me, saying they can’t get the rooms clean because nobody is coming to work. Restaurant staff are not showing up, and these people building buildings can’t complete their projects because nobody’s coming to work,” Nungesser said. “We gotta fix that, and I don’t know how to fix it.”
Sheltering in place through the ICE storm

If creating a climate of fear and crippling certain businesses was Trump’s goal, consider the early results from Catahoula Crunch “mission accomplished.” 
Schools in the area report significant attendance drops since the start of the operation, with Jefferson Parish seeing 3,500 more absences the day after its launch compared to the same day last year, the Times-Picayune reported. The highest rates were at schools with the greatest numbers of English-learner students. 
Reporters with The Lens recently canvassed the city to see how the sweeps were affecting immigrant communities and the businesses that rely on them. 
“We’re a Latin-based store; 80% of our clientele is Hispanic. I want to say at least half of them have stopped coming,” said the owner of a New Orleans grocery-bakery. He asked for his name to be withheld to avoid being targeted. “People left. People are afraid. Nothing positive is coming out of this.”
Similar stories have been reported in other states where the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has conducted immigration crackdowns. And like Louisiana, the number of violent criminals apprehended has been relatively small. 
For example, only 1.5% of the 1,900 arrests in Operation Midway Blitz involved people with violent criminal backgrounds as of early December, with two-thirds having no record of any criminal offense other than an immigration violation, the Chicago Tribune reported. 
Our colleagues at Stateline analyzed immigration arrest data through the first 10 months of the Trump administration and compared it with information for the same period last year under the Biden administration.
The Trump efforts are averaging about 30,000 arrests per month, which includes considerably more criminal apprehensions than recorded under Biden. Yet despite frequent mention of the dangers the undocumented population poses to the U.S., an increasing number of arrests this year are solely for immigration status. 
An ever-larger share of ICE’s arrested immigrants have no criminal record

The share of arrested immigrants with violent crime convictions has dropped from 9% in January to less than 5% in October. Under Biden, the rate stayed consistently between 10% and 11% during the same period in 2024. It was to be expected that a dramatic increase in total immigration arrests would water down the rate of violent offenders ensnared in the dragnets.
But what the Trump camp might not have expected was the pushback it would see when so many of its apprehensions involved immigrants with no past criminal concerns.
“All the immigration sweeps will maintain strong support if they are going after criminals,” Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-Louisiana, told WVUE-TV Fox 8 this week. “I think if they focus on criminals, they are going to have a lot of support. And if they go beyond that, I think people will scratch their head and say, ‘Why are we doing this?’”
Recent polling shows more have soured on U.S. immigration policy.
An Associated Press-National Opinion Research Center survey of more than 1,100 adults conducted Dec. 4-8 showed decreasing support for President Trump’s handling of immigration. 
Nearly half of respondents backed his approach when polled in March, and the approval rate dropped to 38% this month. The decline is also evident among Republicans, falling from 88% to 80%.
In Southeast Louisiana, there is a palpable distaste for Trump’s immigration tactics. It goes deeper than general opposition to tearing families apart and indefinitely detaining people with little to no evidence of wrongdoing. Persons with legal status to be in the United States have been apprehended as well.
It has more to do with the region’s deep history as an international hub of commerce and culture, going back to the state’s mixed colonial roots. Over the ensuing centuries, waves of immigrants have left their distinct, indelible mark on Louisiana: the French, Spanish, Haitian, German, Italian, Croatian, Latin American and Vietnamese make up only a partial list.
More recently, you would be hard pressed to find anyone who doesn’t credit the immigrant community for cleaning up and rebuilding the region after Hurricane Katrina. In the 20 years since their arrival and settlement, they too have contributed to a patchwork pattern the rest of the nation envies, if not the world.  
It’s this celebrated and successful amalgamation that disturbs Trump and his enablers, who rely on division and resentment to achieve their nationalistic vision. 
So far, it hasn’t taken root in Southeast Louisiana, where few feel the need to sweep the swamp.

Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Board of Corrections Chairman Benny Magness, and Corrections Secretary Lindsay Wallace.(Photos by Mary Hennigan, John Sykes and Antoinette Grajeda for the Arkansas Advocate; graphic illustration by Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)Forrest Abrams of Fayetteville was 18 years old when he was found dead in a Little Rock alleyway with four bullets in his back.
Darrell Dennis was convicted of the 2013 murder. A man with a lengthy criminal history, Dennis had been out on parole for five years before Abrams was killed despite being charged with 21 new crimes, including 10 felonies, since his release.

First in a series on Arkansas’ crowded prisons

Between 2010 and 2012, admissions to state prisons fell by 19.6%. That changed after Abrams was killed.
“What happened was Darrell Dennis,” Arkansas Board of Corrections Chairman Benny Magness told the Advocate. The message, from everyone, including legislators and parole officers, was clear at the time, Magness said: “Parole had gotten too lax.”
The Dennis case prompted outrage that trained a harsh spotlight on Arkansas’ prison system. In response to the killing, the Board of Corrections voted in June 2013 to significantly restrict parole, implementing what has been described as a zero-tolerance policy for violations of parole conditions that gave Arkansas the distinction of having the strictest post-prison release policies in the nation.
“There was such a big hoopla over that, that essentially, the parole board was revoking everyone who came up and turning down people for parole, and had a huge spike in the prison population that was solely as a result of that,” said longtime Arkansas defense attorney Jeff Rosenzweig.
Even though some of the restrictive policies were scaled back in 2015 when the board implemented what Magness described as a “happy medium,” the effects of zero-tolerance continue to reverberate today.
Housing convicted offenders is an active source of consternation for legislators, counties and state corrections officials as Arkansas continues to grapple with a growing prison population, fueled by recidivism rates that consistently see around half of released inmates return to incarceration within three years. The number of incarcerated people has strained prison and jail capacity for years. Prison population growth has been cited as a chief reason for building a new, 3,000-bed prison in Franklin County — a prospect that’s sparked fierce backlash in the River Valley community while dividing the Republican supermajority in the Arkansas Legislature.
Division of Correction facilities have a bedspace capacity of 15,362 as of Dec. 9, according to department data. But the number of incarcerated people sentenced to serve time in ADC was 18,997 as of the same day, including 1,852 held in county jails while waiting for a state prison bed.
 Reverberating consequences 
The effect of zero-tolerance in 2013 was almost immediate. The number of parolees returning to the prison system’s custody more than tripled within a three month period. Many of those who returned ended up in county jails for lack of beds in state facilities. By November of that year, the Pulaski County Detention Center was critically overcrowded.


Admissions had increased 72% by 2015 compared to 2012. After nearly three years of large increases in admissions and parole revocations, the board adjusted its parole policy again in 2015.
“We had to change,” Magness said. “We got close to 3,000 people backed up in the county jails. You’ve got to understand that county jail backup has always been somewhere around 1,500, 1,600 people.”
Zero-tolerance marked the end of a short era of shrinking prison population, in part due to Act 570 of 2011, which had a “major impact” on the prison population, according to the governor who signed it into law, Mike Beebe.
“There’s lots of people in the law enforcement community that do not like [Act] 570, but it really did what it was designed to do,” Magness said. “It was just too lenient on probation and parole [violations]. And other than that, it did put a lot more emphasis on probation, which is not a bad thing.”
Arkansas’ prison population never managed to return to the low levels seen in the years immediately before Abrams was killed. Magness said the sky-high county jail backups dropped after the changes were implemented, but admissions to prisons didn’t follow suit.
Rosenzweig said it’s still too difficult to obtain parole. And even when someone does get out, lack of preparation for societal reintegration creates a “vicious cycle,” he said.
The state’s prison population began increasing again in 2021, even as admissions into the prison system fell to their lowest levels since the implementation of zero-tolerance in 2013. Previously, prison admissions and population rose and fell in tandem with one another. Fewer releases from prisons contributed to the decoupling.


Arkansas’ prison population grew faster than the overall population itself over the last 15 years, even as overall crime has decreased, data shows.
But violent crime is beginning to account for a larger share of crime overall as the number of property crimes has fallen off a cliff.
During the Board of Corrections’ November meeting, Wendy Ware, a consultant who does prison population projections for the corrections agency, told members the trend of harsher sentences and fewer releases would create a “stacking effect” that increases the prison population, despite dropping crime rates.
Sentence lengths have generally increased since 2020, and the 2023 Protect Arkansas Act is projected to continue that trend with many offenses, according to the most recent population projections.
The number of offenders sentenced to the corrections system is projected to grow by 2,902 over the next 10 years as a result of the law, according to the most recent department population projections.
The real drivers
While board policy surrounding parole might have been a chief cause of the prison population spike in the 2010s, it coincides with other issues that keep people in a cycle of leaving and later returning to prison.
Drugs, Magness told the Advocate, were and remain a huge reason why people end up in prison — either as an initial offense or as the reason someone is brought back after being paroled — even if what they’re charged with isn’t a drug crime.
“I would be tempted to say at least 50% of our population is drug-related offenses … or drug-related driven,” Magness said. “Until we change our direction on our drug offenses, we’re going to grow [the prison population] by 2% to 3% a year. It’s not going to change.”
Recidivism reports from the department show that around half of people who return to prison on new charges come back on drug charges, regardless of whether their initial offense was a violent, nonviolent or drug charge. About half the people admitted to state prisons are Arkansans who violate their parole, either on a technical violation or with a new charge.
Just putting people in prison doesn’t solve the overarching problem drug-fueled crime creates, according to Magness, who said he isn’t sure the prisons’ current addiction treatment programs are adequate. Inmates sent to the Department of Corrections’ drug treatment facilities can stay for periods as short as six months, he said. That’s lower than it used to be as the board tried to find ways to turn beds faster, he said.
“You’re not going to cure an addiction in six months,” he said, adding that he’d like to see the minimum time increased in the future. “I don’t know that that’s curing the problems of the drug-related offenses.”
Kaleem Nazeem, a co-director of DecARcerate, a nonprofit dedicated to overhauling incarceration policy in Arkansas, said there are bigger issues at play.

A former DOC inmate who was released in 2018, Nazeem said the state’s approach to parole and prison programming is fueling recidivism — and increasing the prison population — by leaving offenders unprepared to return to society, a view echoed by Rosenzweig. Eligibility limitations on programming required for release leave offenders frustrated and resistant when that is what stands between them and returning to the outside world, Nazeem said.
“Policies are ballooning the prison population,” Nazeem said, by making people spend more time in prison than is necessary. “It doesn’t take 20 years for a person to come out of his criminality.”
Magness, whose term on the board ends this month, frequently touts work training programs such as the Act 309 program during board meetings and pointed to examples of successful former participants in his interview. Act 309 of 1983, amended several times, is the law that allows the corrections department to contract with counties to house state prisoners and also provide work opportunities for them.
But Magness acknowledged more could be done.
“We need to listen to inmates that have come out of the facilities and see what we can do to change it,” he said. “I think we need to look at our programming a lot more than we probably do.”
Nazeem said programming to help inmates prepare for release needs to be available far sooner than it is, and it needs to be more comprehensive.
“I’m a prime example of that,” he said. “When I was incarcerated, every time I tried to get into an educational program other than my GED, they denied me for them due to the fact that I wasn’t 36 months from my parole eligibility date.”
Nazeem was sentenced to mandatory life without parole as a minor. He was released in 2018 after a 2012 U.S. Supreme Court decision found such sentences for minors were unconstitutional.
DOC spokesperson Rand Champion said eligibility for Division of Correction programming varies depending on the program and inmate. Those without high school diplomas are required to get a GED before participating in other programming, Champion said.
Nazeem said criteria for release often doesn’t match an offender’s actual needs.
“There’s no preparation for the individual to be reintroduced into society in a healthy way,” Nazeem said, nor are there many wraparound programs to help with reintroduction. He said he could easily see how those without a strong support system could end up back in prison.
“It’s like, in Arkansas, they give you $75 on a gift card; if you stay out for, I think it’s 15 days, they put $75 more on there. That’s what they did to me, you know, after serving 28 years in prison, you give me a $75 gift card and say, ‘Hey, welcome to the world.’”

WILMINGTON, Del. — The Queen Theatre will turn back the clock this weekend as Echoes, Delaware’s own Pink Floyd tribute band known as “The American Pink Floyd,” takes the Main Hall stage on Friday, Dec. 19, at 8 p.m., offering audiences a powerful live recreation of one of rock music’s most influential catalogues.
The performance is part of The Queen’s featured holiday-season lineup and is expected to draw longtime Pink Floyd fans as well as families and younger listeners discovering the music for the first time. With Christmas just days away, the show also adds to a packed weekend of live entertainment in Wilmington, alongside other performances and seasonal events downtown.
Echoes, the American Pink Floyd, an absolute feast for the ears and the eyes. What makes Echoes stand out is their stunning terrific stage show.
Delaware’s Pink Floyd Experience
Formed in Delaware, Echoes has built a strong following throughout the Mid-Atlantic by faithfully recreating the sound, atmosphere, and immersive experience of a classic Pink Floyd concert. The band’s shows span the group’s most celebrated albums, including The Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals, and The Wall.
Echoes is known for its attention to detail, combining layered guitar work, atmospheric keyboards, precise vocals, and carefully designed lighting and visual elements. The result is a concert experience designed to feel less like a tribute and more like stepping into a Pink Floyd show at the height of the band’s career.
With Pink Floyd no longer touring, tribute acts like Echoes provide fans with a rare opportunity to experience the music live, particularly younger audiences who never had the chance to see the original band perform.
Why Pink Floyd Still Matters
Pink Floyd’s influence on rock music is difficult to overstate. Emerging from London’s psychedelic scene in the late 1960s, the band helped pioneer both psychedelic and progressive rock, pushing the genre far beyond radio-friendly singles.
“Pink Floyd popularized the concept album, treating records as unified artistic statements rather than collections of songs.” said Alex Evans, Music Director at the Queen.  “The Dark Side of the Moon became one of the most successful albums in music history, spending more than 950 weeks on the Billboard charts and selling millions of copies worldwide.  Albums like The Wall and Wish You Were Here further cemented the band’s reputation for blending music with storytelling, philosophy, and social commentary and are worth sharing with adult children still today,” continued Evans.
Pink Floyd also set the standard for immersive live performances, introducing elaborate light shows, projections, and stage effects that transformed rock concerts into theatrical, multi-sensory events — a legacy that still shapes arena and stadium shows today.
Their lyrics tackled themes that remain relevant across generations, including mental health, war, alienation, and the pressures of modern life, giving rock music new emotional and intellectual depth.
Sharing the Music Across Generations
That enduring relevance is part of what makes Echoes’ performance especially meaningful for families. Parents attending with older kids and teens often see the show as a chance to share music that shaped their own youth — and to introduce younger listeners to an era when albums were meant to be heard start to finish.
At recent Echoes shows, it’s common to see multiple generations in the audience, reacting together to extended instrumental passages, iconic guitar solos, and familiar lyrics that still resonate decades later.
A Strong Fit for The Queen
The Queen Theatre’s Main Hall provides an ideal setting for Echoes’ detailed sound and visual production, reinforcing the venue’s growing reputation as a regional destination for high-quality tribute acts and live music experiences.
As Wilmington heads into the holiday weekend, Echoes’ return to The Queen offers a reminder of why Pink Floyd’s music continues to endure — not just as nostalgia, but as a living, shared experience.

And many of them did want to vote on this Obamacare, COVID-era subsidy the Democrats created,” Johnson said. “We looked for a way to try to allow for that pressure release valve and it just was not to be.”The enhanced ACA tax credits are set to expire at the end of the year, sharply increasing the cost of health insurance for the roughly 22 million Americans who purchase plans through the exchange and benefit from the subsidies. The House Republican health care bill wouldn’t extend those tax credits, frustrating GOP lawmakers in that chamber who are most at risk of losing their reelection bids during the November midterm elections. Johnson said he expects that GOP bill will pass, though he didn’t address its prospects in the Senate, where bipartisanship is needed for nearly all bills to advance under that chamber’s 60-vote legislative filibuster. ‘Idiotic and shameful’New York Republican Rep. Mike Lawler said in a speech on the House floor that GOP leaders’ decision to let the enhanced ACA tax credits expire was ""idiotic and shameful,"" especially after changes were added to address fraud and reduce costs. “So we have been forced to sign onto two discharge petitions,” he said. “And yet my Democratic colleagues will not join us, but for those that were at the negotiation table.”Lawler then criticized House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, of New York, for not encouraging Democrats to sign onto the bipartisan discharge petitions, noting that would likely get the 218 signatures needed to force a floor vote. He argued that's because Jeffries ""doesn't actually want to solve the problem, he wants the issue.""""This place is disgraceful,"" Lawler said. ""Everybody wants the upper hand.  Everybody wants the political advantage. They don't actually want to do the damn work. This problem could be solved today if everybody who says they care about extending this signs the discharge.""GOP-only bill in 2026?When the House returns from its two-week holiday break next year, Johnson said, leaders may try to use the complex reconciliation process they used to enact the “one big, beautiful bill” to address health care. “What we anticipate going into the first quarter of next year is, possibly in a reconciliation package or in regular order a stand-alone, ideas just like this,” Johnson said after being asked a question about Health Savings Accounts. “We have a long list of things that we know will reduce premiums, increase access and quality of care.” President Donald Trump said Monday he wants Republicans to use the reconciliation process or to eliminate the Senate's legislative filibuster to address health care and other policy priorities. ""Republicans should knock out the filibuster and we should approve a lot of things,"" Trump said. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., has said repeatedly he doesn’t intend to change or scrap the filibuster.Direct payments or tax breaksTrump also reiterated during the Oval Office event he would like to see Congress send direct payments to Americans to help them buy health insurance or afford health care. “I want all money going to the people and let the people buy their own health care. It’ll be unbelievable,” Trump said. “They’ll do a great job. They’ll get much better health care at a much lower cost.”The Senate voted last week on two health care bills, one from Republicans and one from Democrats, but neither received the support needed to move toward a final passage vote. Republicans’ bill would have provided direct payments to some people enrolled in either bronze or catastrophic ACA marketplace plans with up to $1,500 in payments annually for 2026 and 2027. Democrats’ legislation would have extended the enhanced ACA marketplace tax credits for three years. Cost most urgent issue, poll findsA bipartisan group of senators is trying to find solutions that bridge the political divide, though they are unlikely to achieve consensus on the details before the end of this week.A poll released Monday by the West Health-Gallup Center on Healthcare in America shows that cost is the “most urgent” health issue facing the country, followed by access and then obesity. Just 57% of those polled said they were satisfied with how much they pay for their own health care and only 16% were satisfied with the total cost of healthcare.Nearly two-thirds of those in the survey said they believe it's the federal government’s responsibility “to make sure all Americans have healthcare coverage,” while 33% said it’s not.",,,,2025-12-16 12:58:13.294572

(Courtesy photo)A proposed settlement agreement resolving the ethics investigation into former Indiana Secretary of Public Safety Jennifer-Ruth Green would impose a $10,000 fine and no additional penalties, according to a document released Tuesday ahead of this week’s vote by the Indiana State Ethics Commission.
The commission is scheduled to vote Thursday on whether to approve the settlement, which would formally close the ethics case that stems from allegations of ghost employment and misuse of state property brought earlier this fall by the Indiana Office of Inspector General.
Under the agreement, Green admits to violating Indiana’s political activity rule and the misuse of state property rule, as well as to certain factual allegations outlined in the inspector general’s ethics complaint, which was filed on Sept. 12.
In exchange, the commission would agree not to impose any additional sanctions allowed under state ethics law, like more serious fines and even barring a person from future state employment.
Story continues below.
JRG Settlement
 
The settlement requires Green to pay the $10,000 fine within 60 days of the commission’s acceptance of the agreement.
The document explicitly states that the ethics commission “will not impose any further penalties” and that approval would represent the final disposition of the case.
By entering into the agreement, Green also waives her statutory right to a public hearing to contest the complaint before the ethics commission, according to the settlement.
A spokesperson for Green did not immediately reply to the Indiana Capital Chronicle’s request for comment.
How the investigation began
Green abruptly resigned from her cabinet post in early September, but the inspector general had been investigating her conduct months earlier, including concerns about her use of state employees and state property for political and personal purposes.
A remediation agreement signed earlier in the summer — and later obtained by the Capital Chronicle — showed state officials had attempted to address those concerns internally before Green ultimately stepped down.
Indiana inspector general accuses ex-cabinet secretary of ghost employment, misuse of state property

The document outlined allegations that Green directed state employees to draft and edit political content during work hours; used a state-issued vehicle for personal and political travel; and held campaign-related meetings in state facilities.
It also raised concerns about possible retaliation against employees who cooperated with the inspector general’s investigation, warning that substantiated violations could result in further discipline, including termination.
The remediation agreement warned that if additional violations were substantiated, Green could face further discipline, including termination.
The inspector general filed a formal ethics complaint after Green’s resignation, accusing her of violating state ethics laws by involving state employees in campaign-related activities and misusing state property.
In the settlement now before the ethics commission, Green admits that she violated the political activity rule when she had state employees generate content and proofread posts for her “Elect Jennifer-Ruth Green” Facebook account. She also admits to violating the misuse of state property rule by using — and directing a state employee to use — her assigned state vehicle for personal tasks.
What happens next
The State Ethics Commission met privately in a short executive session in September before allowing the underlying complaint to proceed publicly. 
The settlement published Tuesday was included among routine agenda materials for the commission’s Thursday meeting.
The document is signed by Green; Jared Prentice, Indiana’s inspector general; and Elaine Vullmahn, chief counsel for enforcement at the inspector general’s office.
The bipartisan, five-person panel will vote Thursday on whether to accept the settlement, which would take effect upon approval by the commission.
Approval would immediately resolve the matter. Rejection would keep the case open and could send it toward a contested hearing or further enforcement proceedings.
Green’s resignation marked the first departure of a cabinet-level official in Gov. Mike Braun’s administration.
Following her appointment in January, Green’s responsibilities included oversight of the Indiana Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Correction, the Criminal Justice Institute and the Parole Board.
Despite the pending ethics charges, Green announced in October that she will run again for Indiana’s 1st Congressional District. She first challenged Democratic U.S. Rep. Frank Mrvan in 2022 but was defeated.

The public is invited.

Since I was a child, I’ve always loved old things.
About a dozen years ago, I was in southwest Mississippi especially to look at Wyolah, an 1830s house that was for sale.
On my way to Wyolah, I turned a curve on Mississippi Highway 553 and saw something that grabbed my heart.

It was Christ Episcopal Church — down on its heels, but still elegant and classic.
Soon after that, my partner, John Norris, and I bought, restored and moved into Wyolah. Every time I drove by the church, it called out to me for help.
John and I soon became active members of the historic and beautiful church. It has pure Gothic Revival architecture, the congregation dates back to 1820, making it the oldest Episcopal congregation in Mississippi, and we loved being part of that community of faith.
Everyone agreed with us that the church deserved to be saved. But who would take charge?
By then I had completed work on the films, “The Help,” “Get On Up” and “The Girl on the Train” and had some free time. I volunteered to help.

I knew I could refer to experiences and contacts I made after college, when I worked several years as a building contractor.
Christ Church leaders gave me the go-ahead.
Two things kicked off my work. My friend and neighbor, the late Jinny Patterson, said she wanted more than anything to see the original cross put back on top of the church. To do that, we had to replace the leaking roof.
All that happened in 2019, just in time for the church’s bicentennial celebration in 2020.
Another close friend, The Rev. Ken Ritter, Christ Church’s vicar, was miserable on hot summer Sundays when he had to wear heavy clerical vestments. Of course, there was no air-conditioning. We had to have a climate control system. It was soon installed.
Many of the original windows were badly damaged. We found the source of the original stained glass and etched glass in Germany. Experts at Pearl River Glass Studio in Jackson made the windows look like new.
Other successes followed, including masonry and plaster repairs on the interior walls and ceiling. That work was done by Curtis Anderson of Natchez and Jose Ramirez of Ridgeland and their talented crews. Once again, the walls look like they are made of marble blocks.
Jose scraped the ceiling one day and found the original color of paint from 1856.
Also exciting was seeing the date of 1856 hand-written under a pew. Tom Vigil of Natchez found that when all the pews were removed from the church so that he could repair and paint them.
In fact, Tom had to re-create several pews because they were totally unusable.
The last major project was the church floor, which had been painted decades ago. We found the original color of the floor and put it back.
Other newly completed work includes a specially designed handrail up the front steps, a handicapped ramp, a larger organ, upholstery on the kneelers and the placement of the font and its pedestal at its original location near the church entrance.

Ongoing improvements are being made to the church cemetery by The Cemetery Doctor, LLC. Today the church looks just like it looked when it was built in 1857-1858.

Thanks to the generosity of dozens and dozens of people, all the beautiful work at Christ Church has been totally donated or paid for.
To commemorate the restoration, a rededication Eucharistic worship service will take place at 11 a.m. Saturday.
It will be led by The Right Rev. Dr. Dorothy Sanders Wells, the Episcopal bishop of the Diocese of Mississippi.
We invite everyone to attend the service and the free reception afterward. 
The church is located 12 miles north of Natchez at the intersection of Mississippi Highway 553 and Church Hill Road.
Christ Church has worship services conducted by The Rev. Samuel B. Godfrey at 2 p.m. on second and fourth Sundays and is growing as a congregation. We welcome new members.
Bishop Wells perfectly captured the purpose of the restoration when she said, “May God grant this worshipping community many, many more years to shine the light of Christ from this hill.”

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)The U.S. Department of Labor announced plans for a “targeted review” of Minnesota’s unemployment insurance program amid mounting scrutiny of fraud in the state’s human services programs — now a politically potent issue that’s reached the Oval Office.
The department sent a letter to the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development asserting that recent news reports of fraud in the state’s Medicaid-funded human services programs could signal fraud and abuse in unemployment benefits.
“If there has been any related abuse of our (unemployment insurance) systems, it will not be tolerated, and I trust our specialized strike team to get to the bottom of this and report their findings directly to me,” Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer said in a press release.
A spokeswoman for DEED said the agency routinely exceeds the federal Department of Labor’s metrics for payment accuracy and has a fraud rate below the national average.
“We welcome the opportunity to illustrate the strength of our payment controls and oversight,” DEED said.
Chavez-DeRemer is just the latest Trump official to take an interest in fraud in Minnesota in recent weeks after it caught the attention of President Trump, who’s used heritage of those charged in the Feeding Our Future and Medicaid frauds — most have Somali ancestry — to attack the entire Somali American community as “garbage.”
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week his agency is increasing scrutiny on funds going to “areas of concern, such as Somalia,” and investigating allegations that fraudsters have directed their stolen loot to the al-Shabaab militant group. These allegations, based on anonymous sources published in a conservative outlet, are not new and unsupported by any federal terrorism financing charges. (Federal prosecutors have said the fraudsters are greedy, not ideological.)
Dr. Mehmet Oz, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, threatened earlier this month to withhold funding to programs suspected of being targeted by widespread fraud unless the state Department of Human Services provides weekly updates on its audit activities. Those include the 14 programs the Walz administration announced would be scrutinized in October.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development have also announced probes.
Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem claimed without evidence that 50% of Somali visas are fraudulent and blamed Gov.

Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel) to become the next speaker of the House of Delegates.
With the support of the Democratic Caucus to lead the chamber, Peña-Melnyk has more than enough votes to win an election for speaker when the House convenes for a special session that begins at noon Tuesday. Her election will make her the first Afro-Latina and first immigrant to preside over either chamber in the Maryland General Assembly.
“I really don’t have enough words to express how I feel about my colleagues trusting me with this enormous responsibility to lead,” Peña-Melnyk told reporters as she emerged from the 40-minute caucus meeting. “I’m an inclusive leader, and I’m going to lead with my colleagues. This House belongs to all of us.”
Peña-Melnyk, who serves as chair of the House Health and Government Operations Committee, quickly emerged as the leading candidate just days after former Speaker Adrienne Jones (D-Baltimore County) announced she would relinquish the gavel but remain a member of the House. Jones stepped done Dec. 4.
Peña-Melnyk’s selection was very different from Jones.
In 2019, Jones announced then withdrew her candidacy for speaker. She later emerged as a compromise candidate when then Dels. Dereck Davis and Maggie McIntosh were not able to secure enough votes to succeed Michael Busch, who died in office earlier that year. When she took office, Jones became the first woman and the first Black lawmaker to lead either chamber in Maryland.
Peña-Melnyk was one of four candidates seeking to replace Jones as speaker. She quickly secured enough votes to seal the nomination, and within days the three other candidates for the job said they would withdraw and support Peña-Melnyk.
The election in the House Democratic Caucus was punctuated with cheers that could be heard in the hall outside the closed door gathering. It was over in less than 20 mins.

Once a lively gathering spot filled with the aroma of homemade foods and the sounds of chattering families, now the humming of the fridge and other machines can be heard.
“I could almost count how many sales I made in the past three weeks, because the mall is empty,” Warsawe said. 
Somali-owned businesses across Minneapolis have become eerily quiet after ICE targeted the Somali community in recent weeks, sparking fear throughout the Twin Cities.

Once vibrant businesses and bustling corridors now resemble a deserted city. Business owners say foot traffic has nearly vanished since ICE arrived in force. The big conversation among them: how to pay the next month’s rent.
“The tenants in the mall are worried that if ICE raids continue to target the community for several more months or even a year, how will they be able to pay the rent at their shops or cover their daily expenses?” said Basim Sabri, the mall’s owner. 
Customers are staying away, even if they are citizens or legal residents, he said, because “They feel intimidated by ICE activities because we have seen cases where ICE does not discriminate in who they arrest,” Sabri said.
The Somali community is not alone. Burrito Mercado, a Latino community landmark in St. Paul, is reducing inventory and hours, the Pioneer Press reported this week. “The immigrant community being very fearful … that’s obviously keeping folks away,” the owner told the newspaper. 
Even if ICE fails to achieve the mass deportation sought by the Trump administration, they may succeed in choking off immigrant economies. 
The Karmel Mall is not just a place for business. It is a community hub, home to child care centers where the shop owners drop off their children, an eldercare facility, a mosque and a Qur’an school.

ICE agents came to Karmel in the early hours of Monday afternoon and reportedly detained at least four people. 
One of the people detained was a pregnant Somali woman. Abdisalan Abdi, who owns a money transfer business, said he watched the woman as she sat down to prevent herself from falling or slipping. Officers grabbed her by the arms and dragged her through the snow, he said. 
One other person was a young Latino man. Abdi, who saw the interaction, said he cannot confirm whether the man was taken away or released. 
A Somali U.S. citizen was released after being detained, Abdi said.
A large crowd arrived quickly and blocked the ICE vehicles with their cars, demanding the release of the detainees. 
Minneapolis police and Hennepin County Sheriff’s deputies also came to the scene, outnumbering the ICE officers, who quickly left.

Sabri, the mall’s owner, said almost all businesses are affected, but restaurants across immigrant neighborhoods have been hit especially hard. Many have closed.
The most affected area starts at Lake Street and Blaisdell Avenue, extending east to the river, with many Latino shops.
“Lake Street, which used to be busy with heavy foot traffic, is now a ghost town,” he said. 
Sabri remains hopeful. “It’s very unfortunate that it came to this point, but we are optimistic that this is a cloud that’s going to pass,” he said.
Following a xenophobic tirade during which President Trump called Somalis “garbage,” Sabri said he would challenge the president or his cabinet to come and see the Somali community in person. They would change their minds when they see the community, he said.
If the problem persists and tenants are unable to pay their rent, however, the issue will cascade, Sabri said, with potentially devastating effects on tenants, landlords and the entire community.
Samiya Ahmed, a restaurant manager at Karmel, said that even though most shops and restaurants are closed, she’s staying open, hoping upon hope she can generate enough revenue to survive.   
“Even though there’s not a lot of business these days, I still open it every day because with rent due every month, I can’t afford to close it,” Ahmed said.

Dalya Attar, in a February 2025 photo after she was appointed to fill a vacancy in the Maryland Senate.

Dalya Attar (D-Baltimore City) have asked a federal court to dismiss several of the extortion counts against her, arguing that she was the victim of harassment who “simply wanted to be left alone.”
In a filing Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Baltimore, attorneys for Attar argued that the government failed to prove that she and her co-defendants — her brother Joseph “Yossi” Attar and Baltimore City Police Officer Kalman Finkelstein — sought to extort money or property from the victim, meaning those charges, three out of eight, ought to be dismissed.
“This case is not about any attempt by the Defendants to obtain money, property, or thing of transferable economic value,” reads the filing. “The Defendants sought nothing more than freedom from ‘Victim’ 1’s ongoing and well-documented stalking, harassment, threats, and demands.”
The attorneys stopped short of asking U.S. District Court Judge Stephanie A. Gallagher to dismiss the entire case, which also includes counts of conspiracy and wiretapping.
In October, a federal grand jury indicted Attar, her brother and Finkelstein on charges that they carried out a blackmail scheme to silence a disgruntled political consultant who once worked for Attar.

The indictment detailed a plot allegedly carried out by the trio to capture the consultant on video having an affair, and use the footage to scare her, so that she would not attempt to impede the senator’s future campaigns by spreading disparaging information. All three pleaded not guilty last month.
The senator’s attorneys, in Tuesday’s filing, said the government may argue that Attar “retained an ‘economic interest’ in winning the state delegate election,” the filing says the “alleged communications” in the extortion counts were made not to protect her job, but to “escape” the consultant’s intimidation.
In the filing, the attorneys describe a “campaign of harassment” carried out by the consultant, after she was terminated from Attar’s 2018 campaign “for misconduct.”
The filing alleges that the consultant began “relentlessly texting” Attar and members of the Attar family, “with threats to cause economic and reputational harm.”
The consultant, who is not identified in court records, also showed up uninvited at restaurants, at Attar’s parents’ home and “other unexpected locations” for the “sole purpose of haranguing Senator Attar,” according to the filing. Further, the consultant attempted to convince a school that Joseph Attar’s children attended, to expel them “without any rational justification.”
Attorneys for the defendants also pointed to a text message sent to Joseph Attar by the consultant in October 2018.
“Beware,” the consultant wrote, according to the filing. “When u least expect it, expect it. Goodbye. This is my final warning.”
Attorneys for the Attars also took the opportunity to cast doubt on the government’s evidence in the case, pointing out that the government does not possess any of the alleged video footage used in the blackmail scheme.
Instead, the government relied upon one of the victims, who recorded a conversation with Joseph Attar, in which Attar is alleged to have shown a portion of the footage.
“It is Victim 2, and Victim 2 alone, who reports that this fleeting display included intimate images of him and Victim 1 engaging in intercourse nearly two years earlier,” reads Tuesday’s filing. “The Government unquestioningly accepted Victim 2’s allegation as true and relied on it to form the basis of a federal indictment, despite having no other direct evidence of the existence of the alleged illegal recording.”

BURLINGTON – Addison County State’s Attorney Eva Vekos pleaded no contest Tuesday to a charge of drunken driving and received a six-month deferred sentence, allowing the conviction to be cleared from her record provided she does not commit any violations during that period.
The misdemeanor charge against Vekos stemmed from an incident nearly two years ago where she was accused by troopers of showing up to a suspicious death scene in Bridport impaired. 
Judge John Pacht agreed during Tuesday’s hearing in Chittenden County Superior criminal court to allow Vekos to plead no contest as well as the deferment of her sentence over the objection of Assistant Attorney General Rosemary Kennedy, who prosecuted the case.
The hearing Tuesday took place as Vekos, a Democrat, faced calls to resign last week from the heads of the Vermont Democratic and Progressive parties as well as Republican Gov. Phil Scott. 
Those calls followed a VTDigger story this month detailing ethics complaints brought against Vekos from crime victims about how they were treated by her and concerns about how their cases were resolved. She has challenged those allegations against her, and has said she had no plans to step down from her elected office. 
According to court records Vekos was called to meet with state police investigators on the night of Jan. 25, 2024, a homicide scene in Bridport. Troopers later prevented Vekos from driving away from the scene after a couple of them allegedly detected alcohol on her breath, charging documents stated.
At the scene that night, a trooper asked Vekos how much she had to drink that night and she reportedly replied she had one gin and tonic with a burger for dinner about an hour earlier, according to charging documents.
Vekos was eventually taken to the state police barracks in New Haven for processing for drunken driving. 
Before she was taken to the barracks, the charging documents stated, she refused to do field sobriety tests, telling a trooper, “Are you serious Ryan, can’t you just have a friend come and get me,” according to the documents. 
Vekos refused to take a breath test at the barracks and was subsequently charged with drunken driving.
Vekos declined an opportunity Tuesday offered by the judge to address the resolution of the case before he formally imposed the sentence. She also declined to speak to reporters following the hearing. 
This story will be updated.

Don Gaetz has filed a bill to allow college professors, faculty, and teacher assistants to openly carry firearms on campus. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Florida professors, university faculty, and teaching assistants could soon be able to openly carry firearms on campus, thanks to a sweeping new measure filed by a Republican lawmaker.
Sen. Don Gaetz is sponsoring the legislation, entitled “School Safety,” to address security concerns in higher education. If passed, the bill would remove college campuses as gun-free zones — marking a significant shift in how Florida handles gun issues.
It would become one of the few Second Amendment expansion bills adopted in Florida since the Parkland massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in 2018, which prompted a higher gun-purchasing age and red flag laws.
In an interview with the Phoenix, Gaetz called his legislation “sadly timed,” adding that he “never wanted” to file a bill like this.
He referred to a slate of violent incidents in the past few months, including a shooting spree at Florida State University in April, the assassination of Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University in September, a shooting at Brown University over the weekend, and, most recently, an anti-Jewish shooting in Australia that left 15 dead.
“We’re living in a world where our institutions are being threatened,” Gaetz said, adding that he’s already filed another bill aimed at increasing protection outside of churches, mosques, and synagogues. “I’m sorry that I’m having to do this, but it just seems as though places in our society that we thought were safe, even sacrosanct, are now becoming targets.”
Although he anticipates objections that teachers may abuse the ability to bring a gun to school, Gaetz pointed out that there have been no instances of a school shooting sprouting from an unwell volunteer in the guardian program. This school safety initiative allows trained and vetted school employees to carry concealed weapons on K-12 campuses.
“None of the parade of terribles have happened that the opponents to the guardian program tried to advance,” he said. “While none of that has happened, people have been killed.”
What else is in the bill?
Gaetz isn’t this first Florida lawmaker to try to promote campus carry. At the start of the 2025 legislative session, then-Sen. Randy Fine brought his all-encompassing campus carry bill to its first committee — unlike Gaetz’s, Fine’s bill would have allowed all students to carry — but it was voted down. Fine later left to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Gaetz said that the heart of his bill is hardening Florida’s state colleges and universities by requiring better threat assessments, better responses to threats, and better communications between first responders and faculty in emergencies.
SB 896 would allow university employees, faculty, and students who are also working for a college to either openly carry or carry conceal weapons on campus. It also would expand the school guardian program to the university level and create an offense of discharging a firearm within 1,000 feet of school.
Gaetz said his measure also would require universities to ensure all classroom doors lock during an emergency — especially after FSU students discovered during the April school shooting that their doors could not lock. He estimates that around $60 million will end up being appropriated for the effort, in line with what Gov. Ron DeSantis requested in his budget proposal last week.

(David Espejo/Stock photo via Getty Images)President Donald Trump recently issued an executive order to preempt states from passing new legislation or having laws on the books that regulate artificial intelligence, with some
exceptions.
The president believes that the United States should dominate AI for the purposes of “national and economic security.”
He calls for Congress to pass federal law to set a national standard to replace individual state AI regulations that he says impede the innovation the country needs.
States not complying with the executive order will face legal challenges by the U.S. Department of Justice and loss of federal funding.
How should the South Carolina Legislature respond?
There is bipartisan desire to protect children from online exploitation. Sextortion and AI-generated mental health counseling are two of the threats to children that have resulted in possibly up to one in five children being victims and well over 50 suicides nationally.
Every member of Congress will tell you that this must be stopped.
Yet, other than a law on intimate imagery involving deepfakes, there has been no AI regulation by Congress since 1996. And the Communications Decency Act turned out to primarily be a civil liability shield to protect AI companies.
Here’s how you can use the Take It Down Act

It is not only children harmed by AI-generated threats. Adults with mental health issues can also suffer.
Consider this recent Washington Post headline: “A former tech executive killed his mother. Her family says ChatGPT made her a target.”
Over 250 bills in 47 states have been introduced to regulate AI regarding health care.
Then there is the intentional misuse of AI that impacts the lives of many Americans.
For example, over 40 bills have been filed in the states targeting AI algorithms that can be used to “promote anti-competitive and discriminatory practices in the housing industry” resulting in higher rents.
AI algorithms, created by the tech companies themselves, are also largely responsible for our nation being so horribly divided. Social media platforms use the search and browsing history of their customers for the purpose of maximizing use and thus higher profits.
The key ingredient is to feed the customers with messages and misinformation aligned with their interests to drive strong emotional response.
According to Cindy Shen, a communications professor at the University of California at Davis, “outrage and hostility tend to drive engagement” and results in “online echo chambers where extreme views go unchallenged.”
The impact on our political system is that candidates for office find it essential to pay more attention to their voter base with the most extreme, social media-created opinions.
Finding common ground with all voters and the other political parties to solve problems is not rewarded.
No one should expect Congress, even with Trump’s approval, to pass legislation to regulate AI. The billions AI companies have and will spend on the national AI regulation debate will all but guarantee congressional failure, in spite of a national Gallup poll finding 80% approval of more AI safety regulations.
So, should South Carolina move forward with state AI regulations to protect our citizens from the intentional and unintentional harms of AI, which will hopefully include the corrosive effects of
algorithms on our society?
Yes, says state Rep. Brandon Guffey, a York County Republican and an ardent supporter of states’ rights.
He has become a national leader in the effort to protect children from online threats.
Prior to the president’s executive order, Guffey said on my podcast that if there is one that takes away states’ right, “the first thing I am going to do is to try to pass as many regulations as I can on AI just to get challenged in court from the federal level.”
Every state should follow Guffey’s lead to force a national showdown.
While the executive order promises to exempt state AI regulations on child safety protections, no one should assume that will happen when the tech companies push back.
AI must be regulated to protect all of us.
Given an inept Congress bowing to tech billionaires, that job is up to the states.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/chatbot-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-16 11:57:20.983526

(Photo: Cassandra Stephenson)Ford Motor Company is scrapping plans to manufacture a next-generation electric pickup truck at BlueOval City in West Tennessee, looking instead to gas-powered pickup trucks with more stable paths to profit.
The auto manufacturer will begin producing gas-powered Built Ford Tough truck models at its renamed Tennessee Truck Plant in 2029, according to a Monday news release. The facility was previously called the Tennessee Electric Vehicle Center. 
“Ford no longer plans to produce select larger electric vehicles where the business case has eroded due to lower-than-expected demand, high costs and regulatory changes,” the release states. 
The pivot follows an announcement that Ford and SK On will end their joint U.S. battery factory venture, BlueOval SK. 
The joint venture launched in 2021 to build three battery plants: two in Kentucky and one at Ford’s BlueOval City site in Stanton. SK On will own and operate the Tennessee battery plant on Ford’s campus, and a Ford subsidiary will take full ownership of the Kentucky plants. SK On stated it would maintain a strategic relationship with Ford, as the Tennessee battery plant is located on Ford’s campus.
“This is a customer-driven shift to create a stronger, more resilient and more profitable Ford,” Ford President and CEO Jim Farley stated in the release. “The operating reality has changed, and we are redeploying capital into higher-return growth opportunities: Ford Pro, our market-leading trucks and vans, hybrids and high-margin opportunities like our new battery energy storage business.”
Plans at BlueOval City, a $5.6 billion campus located on about 3,300 acres of former farmland, have shifted significantly since the manufacturing plant was announced in 2021.
The company originally planned to produce a new all-electric, next-generation pickup truck beginning in 2025. But slowing demand and the rollback of federal electric vehicle funding and tax credits pushed that date out twice — first to 2027 and then to 2028 as Ford began to focus on smaller, more affordable electric models and hybrids. 
Ford received nearly $1 billion in state economic incentives for the massive campus, contingent on the company creating 5,760 direct new jobs on the site over a 10-year period. The manufacturing plant is expected to employ 3,000 of those workers, with the remainder employed by the battery plant.
Ford delays mass production of electric truck at BlueOval City until 2028

Ford announced a $2 billion investment in its Kentucky manufacturing plant in August, converting the plant to produce smaller electric vehicles. The first vehicle from the company’s new Universal EV Platform will be a mid-sized pickup truck assembled at the Louisville plant starting in 2027.
“The company is shifting to higher-return opportunities, including leveraging its U.S. manufacturing footprint to add trucks and vans to its lineup and launch a new, high-growth battery energy storage business,” the release states.
Ford will turn its focus to producing a range of hybrids and extended range electric vehicles — electric vehicles that also feature combustion engines that act as generators to recharge the vehicle’s battery, extending range for long trips. The company expects about half of its global volume will be hybrids, extended-range electric vehicles and fully electric vehicles by 2030.
Plans have also changed for the next-generation F-150 Lightning, which will now be an extended-range electric vehicle produced in Dearborn, Michigan. Ford also scrapped plans to produce a new electric commercial van for Europe, and will switch to producing affordable gas and hybrid commercial vans in North America, to be manufactured in Ohio.",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_2876-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-16 10:59:13.931732

(Photo by Alex Brandon - Pool/Getty Images)TOPEKA — The federal government cut 90% of funding for a program that helps people enroll in Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act marketplace, leaving Kansans with fewer options for help understanding their health care options. 
The Navigator program paid for experts throughout the state to help Kansans understand program eligibility and the complex systems around Medicaid and ACA, said Robert Stiles, CEO of the Community Care Network of Kansas. 
Stiles’ board of directors decided not to continue the program when funding dropped from $1.5 million annually to $150,000. Navigators will operate through other organizations, even with the reduced budgets, such as Thrive Allen County, he said. 
Stiles said his organization served 4,358 people with about 50 navigators in 10 clinics across the state. Because the notification of the change in funding came in May and his board decided to wind down the program, that wasn’t even a full year, he said. 
With changes in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that affect health care, Stiles is concerned about the people his organization was serving.  
“These were staff that were in the community, they were in local clinics, and they could help someone with their application or help them understand what they needed to submit, or kind of work to get them back on Medicaid or their health insurance,” he said.
Changes in the law include getting rid of continuous eligibility, which means people on Medicaid will have to apply twice a year, rather than once a year.
 “We’re going to see less people that are able to retain insurance,” Stiles said. 
Although it’s difficult to understand the full effect of the law’s changes, Stiles said it’s estimated Kansas’ uninsured rate will jump from 9% to 12%. 
“It’s just going to be even more crucial that we have the local resources that can help people, keep people on their insurance, keep people on Medicaid, because we are going to see sort of a churning where people are going off and on and off and on,” he said. “It’s going to hurt their ability to get health care, but it’s also going to impact the hospital or the local health care clinic and their ability to get care paid for.”
Stiles said the clinics in the Community Care Network of Kansas currently receive $17 million from the state and serve 40% of the uninsured people in Kansas, along with 25% of everyone on Medicaid. 
“They serve a much higher number of those that are on the health insurance exchanges, because often with those plans there’s going to be a lot of things that are uncovered,” he said. “I think that what people don’t know is that our clinics have to provide care, and they have to put you on their sliding scale whether you’re insured or not.”
For example, if insurance says the patient co-pay is $100 but the individual is on a sliding scale, they may pay only $10 for that health care service, Stiles said. 
“We tend to sort of get people that have insurance that doesn’t cover a lot,” he said.
The clinics also offer behavioral health and dental services, and many clients don’t have dental insurance, he said.
With the number of uninsured expected to go up, Stiles is unsure what that means for the clinics in his system. He served on the team that put together the application for the Rural Health Transformation grant, a $50 billion program offered by the Trump administration to try to alleviate some of the health care challenges created by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.   
However, although those dollars will be helpful, they’re only allowed to be used in rural communities, Stiles said. That means just 85 of Kansas’ 105 counties, and some counties that probably should get funds won’t because they’re adjacent to metropolitan areas, he said. 
“It’s not going to cover getting people on insurance. It’s not going to allow us to pay for health care for people that can’t afford it, or don’t have insurance or lose their insurance,” Stiles said. 
The funds will change the health care system in positive ways, with a strong focus on prevention and getting people healthier, he said. 
While that’s important and needs funding and programming, Stiles is worried about immediate systemic effects. 
“We’re going to have to come up with some solutions that get people healthier because the system can’t afford to do their health care when they’re uninsured,” he said. “I think people are interested and excited about some of the ideas that are coming out of that rural transformation approach, but it doesn’t really get at the problems we’re talking about today.”
Stiles remains hopeful.  
“The (One Big Beautiful Bill Act) has some impacts, and I’m not going to discount those, but so much of what we’re talking about is what we should have always been talking about,” he said. “We may not agree on how to get there, but we all should be talking about how do we make our communities places where everybody can be healthy? How do we invest in keeping people from getting sick?”
Such discussions raise tough issues such as pricing medications, such as insulin, and social drivers of health, such as access to healthy food, he said.  
“I am hopeful. This administration, our senators, our federal representatives, our state representatives, we’re having a conversation we need to have,” Stiles said. “We may not agree on how to get there, but at least we can finally agree on the conversation.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/trumpjuly42025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-16 10:59:13.931732

“We can do better than this as Americans and as the state of Michigan. We can do a lot better than these decisions that were already pre-approved for the citizens of this great state,” O’Neal, the chair of the Michigan Legislative Black Caucus, said.
State Rep. Kristian Grant (D-Grand Rapids) took the chance to flip language often used by House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Twp.) on its head, that the cuts were intended to eliminate “waste, fraud and abuse” in government spending. 
“I think that is very important for everyone to understand, to pull that funding midstream without warning is not just unacceptable. It is the very definition of waste, fraud and abuse, because it throws away taxpayer dollars and the real work that was already underway,” Grant said. “When House Republicans disapproved these projects, they didn’t just cut line items. They broke promises and they cut lifelines for the people that we serve.”

State Rep. Mai. Xiong (D-Warren), the Asian Pacific American Caucus co-chair, similarly disputed narratives from Republican legislators about the decision being made to promote fiscal responsibility.
“While House Republicans may be proud that they are saving the state money by clawing back $645 million, that is simply not true,” she said. “This does not make your taxes go down. This does not put money back into your pockets. This money is going back into the general fund, and all of us will have to continue to pay taxes, because that is the law.”
Senate Appropriations Committee Chair Sen. Sarah Anthony (D-Lansing) also promised action to attempt to restore funding that had been cancelled in last week’s decision. 
“Last week’s action came after our people, came after our communities. Enough is enough,” she said. “Just know that we will use every tool in our toolbox, in the state Senate, our Democratic colleagues in the House, working alongside our governor, to restore these critical funds.”
Legislators also criticized the disproportionate impact of funding cuts on Black communities and residents, including key projects to reduce crime and promote educational outcomes in Detroit, as Detroit Caucus Chair State Rep. Stephanie Young (D-Detroit) said. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“It’s so unfortunate because it has caused distress in our communities that was not necessary,” she said, adding that the confusion around exactly which projects were affected by the funding disapprovals was creating a “culture of chaos.” 
“We’re going to continue to dig down deep and to see exactly what’s been impacted,” Young said. “We stand united, the Michigan Legislative Black Caucus.”
The Senate Appropriations Committee will meet later on Tuesday to discuss the work projects. However, Anthony said that the committee would not cancel any further funding —and the deadline to do so has also passed — and that the focus would be on allowing testimony from affected grantees. 
“We would never weaponize the Senate Appropriations Committee for retaliation,” Anthony said. “That type of environment that is being created by the House Republicans has not translated to the Senate Democrats.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC_3474-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-16 10:59:13.931732

These Missourians have been charged but not convicted of crimes, and they were found incompetent to stand trial due to mental health disorders or cognitive disabilities. State law requires the department to provide services and treatment to help them. But in October, the average number of people on the waitlist reached a new high of 487.
Several bills filed ahead of the 2026 legislative session seek to reduce the backlog or build out options to get treatment for people with serious mental illnesses outside of jail. Some stakeholders say the bills have loopholes, but their sponsors maintain they will amp up discussion between lawmakers and the department about the roots of the problem and how the legislature can help.
Two bills add requirements or consequences for the department. State Rep. Jeff Vernetti, a Republican from Camdenton, filed a bill that would require the department to reimburse jails for housing people on the waitlist at a rate of $200 per person, per day, as well as the cost of medication. 
Another bill, sponsored by state Rep. Brian Seitz, a Republican from Branson, would impose a 45-day deadline on the department to conduct court-ordered evaluations and require the department to transfer people ruled incompetent to a hospital within another 45 days. The bill would also require the department to submit annual reports to the General Assembly on competency restoration.
Seitz said a key goal of his bill is to bring the department and lawmakers together in conversation to identify solutions.
“This will open the dialogue to [say], ‘We see there’s a problem, let’s diagnose the problem and solve the problem,” Seitz said. “And I think creating deadlines like I did in the legislation and then requiring an annual report will show us where the problem lies.”
Vernetti said the entire state “has to do a better job of finding ways to get people the help that they need.”
‘Warehoused in jails’: State accused of denying mental health services to incarcerated Missourians

A bill filed by a pair of Democrats — state Rep. Aaron Crossley of Independence and state Sen. Maggie Nurrenbern ofKansas City — seeks to establish guidelines for court-ordered involuntary outpatient treatment before a person gets a criminal charge. 
The state’s framework for competency restoration — treatment and services designed to allow defendants to have their day in court — has been moving away from department-run psychiatric hospitals. 
A 2023 law authorized the department to offer jail-based competency restoration services and also allowed outpatient treatment for people who could be safely released on bond. The department launched four jail-based pilot programs in St. Louis city and county, as well as Clay and Jackson counties, but law enforcement officials involved in those pilots have reported mixed results.
Crossley said his bill, which delineates a process for courts to assess whether involuntary treatment is necessary and for the person to respond, is designed to “make sure that we’re not forcing people into a situation that is against their will unless it’s absolutely necessary.”
He said it could also help slow the growth of the waitlist for competency restoration services by helping people get treatment earlier.
“We’re talking about getting people help as early as we can,” Crossley said, “and we know that when we help people with any health care issue, the earlier the better, and the more restored they will be to live dignified lives in the community.”
Nurrenbern said the bill would lay out a pathway to get treatment for people with serious mental health conditions who would be better served outside of a psychiatric hospital.
“As we look at this from a state perspective, I think one of the things that should be compelling to individuals is that this is a more efficient model,” Nurrenbern said, “that it can be a more fiscally responsible model, and it can be a model that can be used to ensure that we’re also not breaking individuals’ constitutional rights.”
 A persistent problem

The department has long acknowledged the growing number of Missourians who are waiting for a hospital bed to move their cases toward trial or dismissal. 
Months before the filing in November of a federal class action lawsuit against the department, Mental Health Director Valerie Huhn in May told lawmakers on the House Health and Mental Health Committee that the waitlist left the state vulnerable to litigation. 
“I just wanted to make everybody aware of some of the risks that we know we’re taking on because we can’t get these individuals from jail into our state operated hospitals,” Huhn said in May. “Obviously their illness is worse, and as their treatment is delayed, that makes it harder for us to turn them around.”
Dr. Jeanette Simmons, the department’s deputy director, told The Independent in October that the waitlist is growing because courts are requesting more competency evaluations and the department has a static number of hospital beds.
“As that number continues to increase, I’m not surprised that the number of folks found incompetent increases,” Simmons said. “It clearly correlates together.”
The department maintains that everyone on the waitlist is getting help.
In addition to the jail-based pilot programs, the department indicated in October that two mobile teams of clinicians that visit jails statewide helped 117 people attain competency last year.
But the jail-based programs have met roadblocks.
Sarah Boyd, spokesperson for the Clay County Sheriff’s Office, said Friday that the agency is terminating its agreement with the department in January.
“Our goal in participating in this pilot program was to reduce the number of Clay County inmates awaiting placement in a Missouri Department of Mental Health facility,” Boyd said, “and that did not happen.”
Boyd said the number of people awaiting hospital placement in the jail stayed steady at 7-8 people during the pilot and that the compensation the jail received from the department did not cover the cost of dedicating a pod to competency restoration.
Returning that pod to full occupancy, Boyd said, “will save hundreds of thousands of dollars.”
The sheriff’s office will continue working with mental health staff the department had contracted as part of the pilot program, Boyd said.
“We wanted to be part of a broader solution, but in the current form of this program, it didn’t work out,” Boyd said.
 Proposed solutions

Cape Girardeau County Jail Administrator Richard Rushin said his agency built two mental health pods in the new jail opened in September, partly because the jail is expected to house people awaiting services from the state’s mental health department.
Rushin estimated that the pods, which contain 28 single-bed cells with cameras, cost $7.5 million of the $54 million the sheriff’s office spent on the jail.
Rushin said he supports Vernetti’s jail reimbursement bill partly because of the cost of housing people with acute mental health needs, including medications and extra staff.
Taney County Sheriff Brad Daniels said “it wouldn’t hurt to get some of those funds back from housing the inmates.” 
“But to me, that’s not the big thing,” he said. “I’m not in this job to make money off of housing prisoners. I feel like we need to get them the help that they need so that they can move on.”
State Rep. Jeff Vernetti, a Republican from Camdenton, speaks during Missouri House debate on Feb. 27 (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).
Vernetti said “the money is not the motivation.”
“This is about the discussion on the issue,” Vernetti said, “because I think that if we just threw money at the current problem, that’s only continuing the problem.”
Daniels said he likes that Seitz’s bill would give the department a 45-day deadline to place someone in a hospital.
In recent weeks, Daniels said, the department has been taking about two weeks to complete competency evaluations, often via telehealth. That’s an improvement, he said, but wait times for a hospital bed are still long.
Of the seven people in his jail who have been ruled incompetent, Daniels said on Wednesday, one has been waiting over 14 months for hospital care.
“Once they’ve been determined to be incompetent,” Daniels said, “we need to get them out of here.”
Rushin said he would support the 45-day deadlines Seitz’s bill imposes on the department “if [the bill] would actually hold them accountable for that.” But he doubts the department would meet the deadlines.
“I hate to sound negative, but right now, all they have to do is keep asking for extensions,” Rushin said.
While state law already requires the department to complete competency evaluations within 60 days, the department often takes longer — an average of 75 days, according to its fiscal year 2027 budget request. 
There is no law capping how long the department can take to transfer someone to a hospital. 
Rushin said that many of the people who have been jailed and ruled incompetent in his county were charged with misdemeanors like trespassing.
“If they plead guilty upon the first hearing with an attorney present, they might get 30 or 60 days, [or they] might get six months,” Rushin said. “Yet they end up going about 18 months to two plus years through this process because of the backup.”
It’s gotten to the point, he said, where “there’s no due process anymore for these lower-lying laws, which is a violation of their rights.”
 Money matters

Addressing the underlying causes of the backlog, Nurrenbern said, comes down to funding. 
“Departments have been telling us to do more to increase wages, and we haven’t done that,” she said. “Unless we spend significant state resources to invest in our workforce in the Department of Mental Health and Department of Health and Senior Services…we’re not going to do anything to be able to alleviate the gaps that exist there.”
Seitz and Vernetti underlined a need to keep the department accountable in its spending.
“We spent money on the mental health department,” Seitz said. “I’m sure they do a great job in very many areas, but this is one area seemingly that people have fallen through the cracks.”
Vernetti said a shortage of hospital beds “would be the wrong answer [for the department] to give.”
“Then we’re going to start looking at their budget and seeing, ‘OK, let’s maybe move some of your budget from an area that you’re not spending all of it, or maybe not spending it wisely,” Vernetti said.
Daniels and Rushin said they hope lawmakers’ attention to the backlog of people awaiting mental health services in jails will yield solutions.
“They don’t deserve to be living like that,” Daniels said. “They need to get the help that they need so that they can either be found guilty or not guilty of the crime that they have allegedly committed, and get on with their lives or serve their time.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/prisoner-behind-bars-handcuffs-jail-prison-getty-e1673729426865-1.jpg,,,2025-12-16 10:01:25.689917

But there may be a divine opportunity. 
Religious institutions across the state own thousands of acres of land – a massive reservoir of potential housing – and if just half of the developable parcels were built out at higher density, researchers estimate it could create a striking half a million new housing units. That generous estimate would be more than twice the state target of 222,000 new units that officials say is needed by 2035. 
Faith-based organizations control approximately 4,860 developable parcels totaling more than 20,000 acres across the Commonwealth, according to an analysis by the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy’s Center for Geospatial Solutions commissioned by the Lynch Foundation.  
“We do not have another option here in Massachusetts,” said Katie Everett, executive director of the Boston-based Lynch Foundation, which focuses on a range of issues, including housing and homelessness, driven by Catholic principles. “We are not getting any bigger. In fact, we’re probably getting smaller due to environmental challenges” that put areas of the state off limits for new development. “This is it.” 
The 2025 findings – the second year of a comprehensive Bay State survey of religious land ownership through the partnership – were released as a cohort of state lawmakers and advocates push for legislation that would streamline housing development on religious properties. The so-called YIGBY bill, short for “Yes in God’s Back Yard” and a twist on the pro-housing slogan YIMBY or “Yes in My Back Yard,” would reduce local zoning barriers for parcels owned by religious communities that currently prevent or slow housing construction. 
Though the nearly 5,000 developable parcels are just a small proportion of land statewide, their strategic location and size make them uniquely valuable for development. About 63 percent sit near transit stops, 65 percent already have water and sewer access, and 54 percent are in areas with above-average walkability, according to the report. The average parcel spans four acres, large enough for substantial housing projects, and is assessed at just over $2 million. 
The land does not just consist of large parcels where churches and other faith congregations are based.  
“What we were struck by, when we started looking at the parcel data for faith-based institutions, is everyone immediately thinks about the places of worship,” said Reina Chano Murray, associate director at the Center for Geospatial Solutions. “But we found that there were a fair number of residential parcels that appeared to have been willed or gifted to congregations by their parishioners.” 
The inventory found 39 percent of developable religious parcels are owned by non-Catholic Christian denominations, 33 percent by Catholic institutions, 20 percent by non-denominational organizations, 5 percent by Jewish congregations, and 3 percent by other faiths. Almost 83 percent of it is zoned as residential property – all of it tax-exempt.

This land is spread across the state, but mostly centered around larger urban areas like Boston, Worcester, and Springfield. Proponents of unlocking it for housing point to YIGBY bills that have been passed in California, Minnesota, Oregon, and Washington that cleared the way for several housing projects on religiously owned land that boasted unit counts near 50. 
The Massachusetts YIGBY legislation, proposed by state Sen. Brendan Crighton of Lynn and Rep. Carlos González of Springfield, would allow faith-based organizations to build multi-family housing by right on parcels they’ve owned for at least three years. Developments with 30 or more units per acre would be required to set aside 20 percent as affordable for households earning up to 80 percent of area median income.  
Projects exceeding 50 units per acre must designate 25 percent affordable, or 20 percent affordable for households at 60 percent AMI or below. 
Unlike most tax-exempt religious property, new developments would pay local property taxes unless municipalities decide to allow exemptions. If just half of the parcels were developed – given that not all would likely be subjected to local taxes – they would generate approximately $61 million in annual municipal revenue, according to the foundation’s estimates. 
Buildings within half a mile of transit could not face parking requirements. 
“We’re looking for every tool possible in our housing production toolbox,” Crighton said. Massachusetts has approved roughly 14,000 housing permits annually in recent years, far short of the 222,000 units needed by 2035, according to state estimates. 
According to the Lynch Foundation, which supports the YIGBY bill, depending on the level of density and amount of land developed, between 60,000 and 500,000 units of housing could be built.  
This is the first year that YIGBY legislation has been filed in Massachusetts, and there is no clear opposition organized at this point. But that may change if the bill gets more traction.  
Statewide zoning mandates often draw stiff resistance from communities, which insist on local control over land use. The bill carries some echoes of the MBTA Communities housing law, which requires zoning for new multi-family housing near transit stops and has faced strong opposition from some communities. 
As with the MBTA Communities law, there is a danger of overpromising and panicking municipalities that express alarm at overdevelopment. While half a million units is an astonishing amount of potential housing, experts generally caution that the highest estimates are often a dramatic overstatement of any housing policy’s impact. If roughly 10 percent of the religiously owned developable parcels were built out, the Lynch Foundation estimates more like 80,000 new units could come online – still potentially meaningful progress as the state slogs toward its 222,000 unit goal. 
Several churches already are eagerly working to find ways to convert their parcels into affordable housing as congregations shrink. The Archdiocese of Boston, through its Planning Office of Urban Affairs, has developed almost 3,000 units since 1975 from Boston to Brockton to Wrentham. The archdiocese did not make planning office officials available to discuss its land inventory or project identification process for this story, but told CBS Boston in August that nearly a dozen properties have been converted into affordable or mixed-use housing. 
“When we are having conversations with parishes, with pastors, it’s about how can we continue to preserve our legacy of service and help to continue to meet the needs of the community. An effective way to do that is to look at the property and to see how it can be repurposed for affordable mixed-income housing,” Bill Grogan, the president of the archdiocese planning office, told the station.

Kurt Lang, pastor at the East Coast International Church in Lynn, testified in support of the YIGBY bill during a hearing in July. 
“As an expression of our church’s desire to bring housing to the unhoused,” he said, the Lynn church owns 40 units, mostly affordable rentals as well as nine transitional housing units in which the residents don’t pay rent while they look for more permanent housing. There is no requirement that residents be part of the congregation, he said. 
Lang noted that even small congregations can tie up substantial developable space if developing the land for housing doesn’t seem feasible. “Many other religious groups would begin to create affordable and working-class housing if the opportunity and a path was created for them,” he said. 
In his testimony, Lang told lawmakers about a Protestant church inside Route 128 that he said has just 12 people attending but owns 45 acres of land. The church met with him and expressed interest in turning the land into housing. 
“They quickly retreated upon learning about the zoning challenges,” Lang said.  
A small religious college in Boston, looking to offload 25 acres of land to a real estate management company for conservation, told the Boston Globe last week that it had considered developing the forested area but chose conservation instead after considering the myriad “zoning, regulatory, and community hurdles that would take years to address and may have never been resolved.”  
Faith communities trying to build housing without YIGBY options have faced years of delays and expensive rezoning battles. Hartford Street Presbyterian Church in Natick has spent 40 years attempting to build housing and recently sheltered migrant families in its basement while seeking zoning relief.  
The Lynch Foundation says there have been redevelopment successes, pointing to the mixed-use Overlook at St. Gabriel’s in Brighton, which converted a former monastery campus into 555 apartments, including 83 affordable units.  
Even identifying religiously owned parcels ripe for development is not a simple matter.  
Assessors’ records varied wildly in quality for tax-exempt properties, according to Chano Murray at the Center for Geospatial Solutions. Some parcels listed deceased clergy as owners, their deaths never recorded. Others used inconsistent abbreviations like “Rom Catholic Arch” that required algorithms to identify. 
Religious organizations may not know their full portfolios. Ownership can be complicated by distinctions between diocese-owned versus congregation-owned property, or parcels held in clergy names for administrative purposes.  
Proponents of the YIGBY legislation include religiously centered advocacy groups like the Jewish Alliance for Law and Social Action (JALSA), housing groups like Citizens’ Housing and Planning Association, real estate developers, chambers of commerce, and faith leaders across denominations. 
In written testimony, JALSA president Cindy Rowe grounded support in Jewish teachings: “On Yom Kippur, our most sacred holiday, we read in Isaiah, ‘take the poor into your homes,'” she said. She noted that Massachusetts has the third-highest median home price and highest median rent nationally, with prices increasing $300,000 on average from 2014 to 2024. 
“We must take every step that we can to make housing available to all,” she wrote. “Upholding human dignity, the fundamental Jewish value of Kavod HaBriyot, demands that we ensure housing for all.” 
Crighton still shakes his head over a local project that stalled out several years ago while he was on the Lynn city council.   
“This was a vacant plot of land, not being used, in an area that already had multi-family housing,” he said. “So it wouldn’t drastically alter the character of the neighborhood or anything.” But the religious group trying to build affordable housing on a parcel it owned couldn’t get the support they needed on the council, he said. 
“It got scrapped. And a decade later, I drive by this parcel,” he said. “It’s still just sitting there, and to think that families could have been living there for the past decade, you know, it was incredibly frustrating. That wouldn’t happen under the updated zoning. The legislation simply creates incentives to develop for housing rather than leave parcels vacant.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/churches2-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C600&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-16 10:01:25.689917

Kelly for illegal-orders video,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/pentagon-escalating-investigation-arizona-sen-kelly-illegal-orders-video,,"WASHINGTON — The Defense Department says it has upgraded its investigation into Arizona Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly over a video where he and other members of Congress told members of the military they didn’t need to follow illegal orders. “The Office of the Secretary of War, in conjunction with the Department of War's Office of the General Counsel, is escalating the preliminary review of Captain Mark Kelly, USN (Ret.), to an official Command Investigation,” a spokesperson for the department wrote in an email Monday night. “Retired Captain Kelly is currently under investigation for serious allegations of misconduct,” the spokesperson continued. “Further official comments will be limited to preserve the integrity of the proceedings.”Paul J. Fishman, an attorney at the Arnold & Porter law firm who is representing Kelly, wrote in a Monday letter to the secretary of the Navy that “there is no legitimate basis for any type of proceeding against Senator Kelly, and any such effort would be unconstitutional and an extraordinary abuse of power.”“If the Executive Branch were to move forward in any forum—criminal, disciplinary, or administrative—we will take all appropriate legal action on Senator Kelly’s behalf to halt the Administration’s unprecedented and dangerous overreach,” Fishman wrote. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had set Dec. 10 as the deadline for the secretary of the Navy to recommend what to do about Kelly’s appearance in the video, but that came and went without any public announcements.Hegseth also remained silent on the matter after rebuking Kelly weeks ago for posting the video where he and five other Democrats warned against illegal orders.Kelly said on Dec. 9, one day before the deadline, he hadn’t received any information from the Navy or other administration officials. “Forget about an update. I haven’t heard anything from the guy,” Kelly told reporters. “That’s a good question for you guys to ask the Navy.”The secretary of the Navy’s office did not respond to multiple requests for comment from States Newsroom. The Department of Defense posted in late November that officials were looking into “serious allegations of misconduct” against Kelly for appearing in the video. It didn’t detail how Kelly might have violated the Uniform Code of Military Justice but stated that “a thorough review of these allegations has been initiated to determine further actions, which may include recall to active duty for court-martial proceedings or administrative measures.” Hegseth referred the issue to Navy Secretary John Phelan for any “review, consideration, and disposition” he deemed appropriate. Hegseth then asked for a briefing on the outcome of the review “by no later than December 10.”Kelly said during a press conference in early December the military’s investigation and a separate one by the FBI were designed to intimidate the six lawmakers in the video from speaking out against President Donald Trump. The lawmakers in the video, who have backgrounds in the military or intelligence agencies, told members of those communities they “can” and “must refuse illegal orders.”“No one has to carry out orders that violate the law or our Constitution. We know this is hard and that it’s a difficult time to be a public servant,” they said. “But whether you’re serving in the CIA, in the Army, or Navy, or the Air Force, your vigilance is critical.”The other Democrats in the video — Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin, Colorado Rep. Jason Crow, Pennsylvania Reps. Chris Deluzio and Chrissy Houlahan, and New Hampshire Rep. Maggie Goodlander — are not subject to the military justice system. Trump railed against the video a couple days after it posted, saying the statements represented “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!”",,,,2025-12-16 10:59:13.931732

MAURA HEALEY called on federal immigration officials Monday to stop using private aircraft at Hanscom Field airport to move people out of state “without due process of law.”
In a Dec. 12 letter to Secretary of Defense Kristi Noem and US Immigration and Customs Enforcement Acting Director Todd Lyons, Healey demanded the agency “immediately stop using any Massachusetts airports and private jets to deport residents and obstruct due process, and to halt this practice across this country.”
Asked how and when she became aware of the situation at Hanscom, Healey spokesperson Karissa Hand said that Healey “was alerted to it by advocates.”
ICE did not respond to a News Service inquiry about Healey’s claims, why the agency might be using Hanscom and when that use began. 
Located in Bedford, Hanscom Field is a regional aviation facility managed by the quasi-public Massachusetts Port Authority.
Asked about details of ICE-related flights out of Hanscom, MassPort Director of Media Relations Jennifer Mehigan said ” ‘ICE flights’ refer to charter flights operated by fixed based operators at Hanscom. Massport does not receive prior knowledge of these flights, nor does the Authority have a role in their operation.”
“The flight information we receive does not indicate which flights are operated by or are associated with ICE. We would refer you to the federal government for specific data on those flights,” Mehigan added.
Healey in her Friday letter said ICE’s use of private aircrafts at Hanscom “to quickly remove residents and sever them from their family, friends, and counsel without due process of law” is part of ICE’s “disturbing and anti-American deportation tactics.”
The US Department of Homeland Security recently announced that its enforcement operations have led to more than 605,000 deportations since Jan. 20, 2025.
“DHS has prioritized removing the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens as part of the Trump Administration’s efforts to return law and order to the United States,” a Dec. 10 release said. 
Another 1.9 million people have “voluntarily self-deported” since January, according to DHS. 
“As you well know, a significant majority of people detained by ICE in Massachusetts over the past year have no criminal convictions or charges,” Healey wrote. “They are hard-working, productive, and beloved members of our community that you have indiscriminately targeted for deportation proceedings. Many of them are in the midst of a lawful process seeking citizenship through Massachusetts courts.”
During ICE’s recent weeks-long enforcement operation in September, the agency reported apprehending more than 1,400 people. DHS said that more than 600 people arrested “had significant criminal convictions or pending criminal charges for crimes committed in the United States or were known foreign fugitives.”
Healey in her Monday statement referred to reporting from “The New York Times,” which shows that 63 percent of immigrants arrested by ICE in major operations in Massachusetts between Sept. 4 and Sept. 30 had no criminal charges against them. 
“Flying these residents out of state and away from their support systems and legal counsel — often within hours of arrest — is intentionally cruel and purposely obstructs the due process and legal representation they are owed,” Healey wrote. 
Immigrant advocates have been calling on state lawmakers to protect immigrants who might be targeted by federal immigration officials. They’ve rallied at or near the State House, and some recently testified in favor of bills they say would make a dent in the issue locally. 
After Healey’s office released her letter, the Massachusetts Democratic Party late Monday called on three Republican candidates for governor to “denounce ICE’s Use of Hanscom airport for deportations.”
“The silence by Brian Shortsleeve, Mike Kennealy and Mike Minogue on all ICE matters speaks volumes,” party chair Steve Kerrigan said in a statement. 
The Massachusetts Communities Action Network on Tuesday plans to gather faith groups to hold a press conference and multifaith prayer vigil at 10 a.m. at the Boston Tea Party Ships and Museum Area to “take action for immigrant justice” and “protect the people and sovereignty of Massachusetts.”
Clergy and lay leaders will be “calling on the governor to use her executive authority to protect the rights, safety, and dignity of Massachusetts residents — especially immigrants — in the face of harmful federal actions,” according to the Essex County Community Organization, a multi-faith network based in Lynn.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Bedford-Hanscom_Air_Traffic_Control_Tower-e1765895738899.jpg?fit=499%2C375&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-16 10:01:25.689917

The Federal Bureau of Investigations’ office in Anchorage issued an alert warning Alaskans of scams impersonating law enforcement or government officials demanding payment. Alaskans lost an estimated $1.3 million due to this type of government impersonation scam in 2024 — more than five times the previous year’s losses.
Officials say Alaskans should not respond to calls claiming they have missed jury duty or have warrants out for their arrest. Officials say anyone targeted by such calls should not provide personal information or payment to the caller, but they should report scams to the agency.
“This scam isn’t new, but we are certainly seeing an uptick in this type of scam here in Alaska,” said Chloe Martin, a public affairs officer with the FBI Anchorage office.
In 2024, the bureau reported 6,670 fraud complaints from Alaskans, with over $26.2 million in losses. 
Scammers are calling residents and identifying themselves as an FBI official, a member of state or local law enforcement, or a government official. The scammer then claims the victim has missed jury duty or that a warrant has been issued for their arrest and demands payment from the victim, Martin said. 
Sometimes scammers will call using personalized information to appear official. “So when they look at their caller ID, it might actually look like it’s a caller from a legitimate law enforcement agency,” she said.
Martin said scammers use urgency, intimidation and fear to demand immediate payment in the form of cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, prepaid gift cards or wire transfers.
Martin urged Alaskans to pause, not give personal information or make payments and report the fraud to their bank and to the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center, a reporting hub for cyber-crime. 
“If reported immediately, it’s actually not outside the realm of possibility to recover funds, so timely reporting is key,” she said. She added that victims should contact their bank to freeze funds if they have responded to a scam. 
Last year, the FBI recorded a more than five fold increase in losses from these scams, from nearly $250,000 lost in 2023 to more than $1.3 million in 2024.  


Austin McDaniel, a spokesperson for the Alaska Department of Public Safety said it is common for scammers to impersonate Alaska State Troopers. 
“These scammers will go through and find the name of an Alaska law enforcement officer at that agency and call, pretending to be an actual state trooper, so that they’re sophisticated,” he said.
“This happens across the state. This targets every age demographic, and it’s something that we see a lot of,” he said. “I have personally received these types of scam calls demanding that I pay some type of exorbitant fee because I missed jury service. And thankfully, I know that’s definitely a scam, but not everyone does.”
McDaniel said it’s difficult to track, investigate and prosecute scammers because some of them are calling internationally, and are difficult to trace. He urged Alaskans to be cautious and not to make payments. 
“Law enforcement, the government, a utility, a bank, is never going to call you and demand money with a gift card or with Bitcoin,” he said. “If you get some type of suspicion that something’s wrong, it probably is.” 
Earlier this month, the Federal Emergency Management Agency issued an alert warning Alaskans of scammers posing as government officials, insurance agents or aid workers targeting residents impacted by Typhoon Halong receiving disaster assistance. 
Officials urged residents to contact FEMA to verify if a call is legitimate. 
McDaniel and Martin said their departments could not confirm cases of scammers specifically targeting residents impacted by the Western Alaska storm at this time, but McDaniel emphasized his department sees scammers victimize those who may already be more vulnerable. 
“We see it happen with missing persons,” McDaniel said. “Someone will call and try to defraud family members of missing people. Usually any type of situation where there’s some type of tragedy or emotional response to something, scammers will attempt to go through and exploit that.”
According to FBI data, Alaska ranked No. 1 in the nation in the number of internet crime complaints reported, at a rate of 914.7 complaints per 100,000 residents. Scammers target older residents because they can be more susceptible to scams The bureau estimates Alaskans in the age group of 60 or older lost more than $8.1 million to scams in 2024. 
Cryptocurrency scams are growing nationwide, as they are difficult to trace. In 2024, the FBI estimates 45% of Alaskans’ losses, approximately $11.7 million, were related to cryptocurrency related scams.
Such scams  have become a means to cheat investors, also known as “pig butchering,” according to the bureau. Scammers target victims, develop a relationship, and introduce a fraudulent investment opportunity in cryptocurrency.  Victims are coached to invest more and more money into the fraudulent investment, only to then be unable to withdraw their funds. 
Internet-based scams and fraud can range from emergency calls and extortion to identity theft and phishing or spoofing, where scammers identify as a trusted source and aim to gain login details or personal information to steal money or data. The FBI reports that complaints increased nationally by 33% in 2024, with $16.6 billion in losses.

Dec. 16, 2025. | Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan Advance.In a keynote speech at the Michigan Literacy Summit, held Tuesday at the Michigan Science Center, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said that improving literacy rates would remain her top priority in her final year as governor. 
“Helping every child read is tough. It’s a worthwhile goal,” she said. “It’s a long term project that will pay off in decades, not days. It’s a team effort that requires buy-in from students, parents, teachers and policy makers.”
She referenced the increased implementation of the “science of reading” law, which she signed in October 2024, as part of this priority. That law standardized literacy teaching methods across the state and implemented regular dyslexia testing for students up to third grade. She also touted the free school breakfast and lunch program, a key piece of the state’s education budget, and funding to reduce class sizes. 
Michigan currently ranks 44th in the nation for 4th grade reading skills, Whitmer said, calling it a “crisis.”
“The vast majority of people in our state agree this isn’t the fault of any one person or any one policy or any one political party,” she continued. “I know how hard every one of our educators works every day, but we’re all feeling the impact of our literacy crisis.”

State Superintendent Dr. Glenn Maleyko, who officially took over the role leading the state’s department of education on Dec. 8, introduced Whitmer to a crowd of educators and advocates, who had gathered in Detroit for the day-long event that included panels with teachers and school leadership. 
“What stood out to me the most was the governor’s genuine commitment to partnership,” Maleyko said. “She understands that improving outcomes for students is not about politics, it’s about listening, working together and staying focused on what matters most.”
This was Whitmer’s first public appearance since Michigan House Republicans canceled nearly $650 million in spending for departmental projects, a move heavily criticized by Democrats as “untransparent” and “cruel”. While Whitmer’s press secretary shared similar criticism from the governor’s office, Whitmer herself has yet to make a statement on the cuts, and left the summit before speaking to the press.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-16-091445-1024x677.png,,,2025-12-16 10:01:25.689917

(Washoe County School District photo)All but three public school districts across the state saw student enrollment drop this year, according to the data compiled by the Nevada Department of Education.
Statewide enrollment in K-12 public school districts dipped by around 2% for the 2025-26 academic year.
Charter School Authority absorbs 6 CCSD-run charter schools

The notable exception was the Nevada State Public Charter School Authority, which earlier this year absorbed six charter schools previously overseen by the Clark County School District. The transfer of those schools, combined with seats created by new and expanding charter schools, contributed to a 10.9% jump in enrollment for the 2025-26 academic year.
The Charter School Authority’s growth rate excluding the transferred CCSD schools was 2.3%, which is more aligned with the authority’s growth rate in recent years, according to authority staff.
More than 70,500 students statewide are now enrolled at state-authorized charter schools.
Clark County SD saw enrollment drop by 4.7% — from approximately 306,000 students to 291,500, a loss of more than 14,000 students. That number includes the roughly 5,400 students at the six schools the district transferred to the Charter School Authority.
﻿
Washoe County School District saw its enrollment dip by just under 1%, or 6,800 students.
Clark County SD, Washoe County SD and the Charter School Authority enroll approximately 90% of public school students in the state.
Enrollment data among the state’s rural districts showed most lost students.
Churchill, Mineral and Douglas County School Districts had drops around 4%.
Eureka, Elko, Pershing, White Pine and Humboldt County School Districts, as well as Carson City School District, saw enrollment drops in the range of 2% to 3%.
Esmeralda County School District, the state’s smallest school district, dropped from 75 kids to 69.
Meanwhile, Storey County School District, which only has around 400 students total, logged a growth rate of 4% by adding 16 kids. Enrollment in Nye County stayed relatively flat by enrolling seven more students this year than last.
Families opting for charter schools has contributed to declining enrollment rates in the traditional school districts, particularly in Clark and Washoe counties where charter school growth has been concentrated. But other factors, including the nation’s overall declining birth rate and growing interest in homeschooling are also believed to be impacting enrollment rates.

Clark County SD is still by far the largest district in the state, enrolling 62% of public school students. But the Charter School Authority is now the second largest local education agency in Nevada, surpassing Washoe County SD by nearly 7,000 students. The Charter School Authority now enrolls 15%, and Washoe County SD enrolls 13%.
Charter school growth has been outpacing Washoe County SD for a decade now.
This year’s data shows the Charter School Authority closing some gaps when it comes to having enrollment reflect the state’s population as a whole. For example, Black students now make up 12.7% of charter students, compared to 12.4% of students statewide.
Charter school students remain less likely to be classified as English learners (ELL), have an individualized education plan (IEP) or qualify for free or reduced lunch (FRL):

13.9% of students statewide are ELL, compared to 10% of charter school students;
14.7% of students statewide have IEPs, compared to 11% of charter school students; and
36.4% of students statewide are directly certified for FRL, compare to 30.4% of charter school students.

The Nevada DOE requires schools to conduct their official enrollment counts around Oct. 1 of each year. The numbers are used for funding purposes and mandatory reporting. They also provide a snapshot of student enrollment in public schools over time.
The state compiles private school enrollment separately, though the physical count is held around the same date each year. The private school enrollment report has not yet been released by the state. But, as of October, more than 22,000 students were enrolled in private schools in Nevada and officials believed the population was leveling off after a covid pandemic boost.

From CalMatters health reporter Kristen Hwang:
Gov. Gavin Newsom has tapped two prominent former U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials with jumpstarting a new public health initiative — though details of what precisely the initiative will accomplish in the coming months are sparse.
Former CDC Director Dr. Susan Monarez and former chief medical officer Dr. Debra Houry, both of whom have publicly sparred with Trump administration policies, will advise the newly minted Public Health Network Innovation Exchange.
Monarez was fired in August after reportedly refusing to rubberstamp recommendations made by U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s handpicked vaccine committee, which includes prominent vaccine skeptics. Houry resigned partially in protest. 
“It’s not a shadow CDC we’re creating, but it’s a shield to what’s going on,” Newsom said.
So, what will the Public Health Network Innovation Exchange, or PHNIX, do?

In a press conference, Newsom said the purpose is to rebuild public confidence in public health institutions and improve the technology that public health uses to track diseases and monitor trends.
Monarez will oversee innovation and technology for the new program. The state could partner with the private sector and academia to create real-time data sharing systems for health departments or to leverage AI, she said.
Houry will help the state develop partnerships with other public health organizations, building on California’s existing West Coast Health Alliance, which makes vaccine recommendations, and the Governors Public Health Alliance.
The group will also search for funding, both public and private, to bolster public health.

To begin, California lawmakers allocated $4 million to the initiative in this year’s budget. 
It’s not yet clear: 

How the $4 million will be spent and what portion will go toward paying Monarez and Houry;
Whether any other states or public health organizations have formally agreed to partner with California;
When the PHNIX is expected to accomplish its aims by; 
What kind of additional funding it expects to need to do those things.

“This is about upholding science, integrity and trust,” State Public Health Officer Dr. Erica Pan said.

Job fears fuel community college enrollment

Early data from California community colleges are showing an upward tick in enrollment. College leaders are attributing the trend mostly to fears about the economy and unemployment, reports CalMatters’ Adam Echelman.
With rising unemployment rates, a weak job market and the cost of living and consumer goods getting more expensive, more students, particularly returning adults, want to improve their skillsets.

Enrollment at Los Rios Community College District is up by more than 5% compared to last fall. 
Enrollment for students ages 35 to 54 at Los Angeles Community College District is up 28% compared to last year. 
The President of Chula Vista’s Southwestern College said the district had over 32,000 students in the last academic year — its highest enrollment rate since the Great Recession.

But as these colleges serve an influx of new students, many say the state isn’t providing them with enough funds. Mario Rodriguez, an executive vice chancellor for Los Rios, said the Sacramento-area district is serving about 5,000 more students than the system is funded to support, representing about $20 million in lost revenue.

What leads to dry fire hydrants

After wildfires ignited in Southern California in January, reports of a water shortage and dry fire hydrants prompted state and federal investigations. On Monday, a team of researchers at UCLA and Arizona State University published an issue brief that found that when fires burn urban areas, hydrant flows can sputter out and result in poor hydrant performance, writes CalMatters’ Rachel Becker.
When a wildfire rages in a town, each burned home hemorrhages water from the water system, and too many hoses simultaneously feed on a limited supply — leading to a loss of pressure. In fire after fire, researchers found reports of lost water pressure, echoing the conclusions of a recent state investigation of the Palisades Fire.

Kevin Phillips, district manager of Paradise Irrigation District: “Every one of those homes that gets burnt is an open sore to the outside. Your system basically is dying as every one of those homes are being destroyed.” 

This year, California passed a law requiring water systems in California’s fire-prone regions to have enough backup power or alternate water supplies to keep water pumps running. Some water suppliers, however, argue that it costs too much to comply with the law.

Is it worth it?","Guest Commentary written by

Shaye Wolf
Shaye Wolf is the climate science director at the Center for Biological Diversity.


California’s most expensive electricity source is finally poised to lose a government handout that props up its high costs and harmful pollution. In an era of clean, cheap solar and wind energy, policymakers are rightly beginning to treat biomass energy like the boondoggle it is. 
Biomass energy — electricity made by burning or gasifying trees — is an expensive, dirty relic that relies on industry misinformation and taxpayer money. 
In a vote later this month, the California Public Utilities Commission is expected to end the BioMAT subsidy program, which requires electric utilities to buy biomass power at exorbitant costs — four times the average. Californians get hit with those extra costs in our power bills, along with pollution that harms our health and climate. 
Utilities and environmental groups support ending this costly subsidy. 
But the biomass industry is fighting back with misleading claims that its projects are made clean by “new” technology or that they’re needed for wildfire safety. Don’t be fooled.
Burning trees to make electricity harms the climate. In fact, biomass power is more climate-polluting at the smokestack than coal. 
Biomass energy releases toxic air pollutants that endanger health, increasing the risk of premature death and illnesses like asthma. The facilities often are located in low-income communities and communities of color that have long fought to shut them down.  
It is telling that the biomass industry is rebranding. 
It claims it will use “clean” methods to gasify trees instead of burning them. But gasification — which also involves heating organic material — releases large amounts of climate-harming air pollution. 
State regulators in May denied a costly biomass gasification project that couldn’t show it would reduce emissions as promised.  
The industry also promotes carbon capture and storage, claiming this technology will suck up carbon dioxide from biomass smokestacks and store it underground forever. But carbon capture and storage is a costly, decades-old technology with a long history of failure and serious health and safety risks.
Finally, the industry claims biomass energy projects will help pay for forest thinning, which it says will protect communities during wildfires. That means cutting trees, often large trees, which threatens wildlife and destroys forests, which naturally store carbon and fight climate change.
Thinning isn’t a good way to keep communities safe. Most of the community destruction is caused by wind-driven fires during extreme fire weather, made worse by climate change. The fastest-moving 3% of wind-driven fires is responsible for 88% of the damage to homes. 
No amount of forest thinning can stop that. In fact, thinning makes cool, moist forests hotter, drier and more wind-prone, which can make fires burn faster and more intensely.
Most of California’s destructive wildfires — like the Los Angeles area fires in January — have burned in shrublands and grasslands, not forests, making thinning irrelevant in those cases.
A better way to prevent fires
Instead, the best investment for protecting communities during wildfires is hardening homes, so they’re less likely to catch fire, and stopping new development in fire-prone areas. Yet the state has earmarked only 1% of its wildfire funding for home hardening. Most goes to thinning. 
Where thinning occurs, it’s most cost-effective to scatter the wood in the forest to create wildlife habitat, retain vital nutrients, and enhance natural carbon storage. If wood must be removed, it can be turned into mulch and shavings. The worst choice is subsidizing biomass companies to make dirty energy.
Any way you look at it, biomass energy is a polluting money pit that won’t solve our climate or wildfire safety problems.
California already has the affordable solutions we need: Clean, cheap solar and wind energy and energy storage to power our state, and home hardening to protect communities from wildfire while growing local economies.  California’s leaders need to embrace these proven solutions and get us out of the expensive, dangerous biomass business.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/092022_Power-Lines_RL_CM_13.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-16 08:56:24.760608

Tuberville has accelerated attacks on Muslim Americans in recent days, calling for their forced deportation on Sunday and making claims about Somali-Americans without evidence. (Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)U.S. Sen. Tommy Tuberville accelerated attacks on Muslim Americans over the weekend, calling for the forced deportation of those of the Islamic faith.
The Alabama Republican’s remarks followed attacks on a school for Muslim children and Somali immigrants in Minnesota, accompanied by the filing of two bills targeting Muslims. The moves drew condemnation and led to the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), a civil rights group that advocates on behalf of people of the Islamic faith, placing him on a list of anti-Muslim extremists.
“Unfortunately, Sen. Tuberville has really gone full blast with his attacks on Muslims,” said Corey Saylor, research and advocacy director for CAIR, in an interview on Monday regarding the list. “Whether that is introducing two bills in Congress to essentially ban our faith in the United States or saying that we are not even a religion. So, that level of assault on an American faith deserves getting designated as what it is, and that is an Islamophobe.”

In a post on X, formerly Twitter, Tuberville said he considers it “a badge of honor” to be labeled as an extremist by the organization.
Former U.S. Sen. Doug Jones, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for governor for a likely run against Tuberville for the office next year, condemned the senator’s remarks in an interview on Monday.
“It is really a sad state of affairs when you have a U.S. senator who is so bigoted with religious bigotry as Sen. Tuberville is,” he said. “We need to be a state for all people, and a welcoming state, and make sure everyone in the state is treated with the same dignity and respect.”
Tuberville introduced the “No Sharia Act” in October that prohibits courts from enforcing the foreign law in the country. It also renders any contract null and void and prohibits family law from enforcing foreign law in family law.
Sharia law consists of Islamic principles that are derived from the Quran, traditions of Islam’s prophet Mohammad, and the statements of Islamic scholars throughout history. There are varying interpretations and applications of sharia in majority-Muslim countries.
Tuberville also filed a companion bill, “Preserving a Sharia Free America Act,” that authorizes the secretary of state and other agencies to deny immigration benefits to people who advocate for Sharia Law or have them deported. It also allows federal agencies to withhold immigration benefits and have people deported if they fail to disclose to federal agency officials that support sharia law.
Tuberville in June said Muslim immigrants would “overwhelm us” and that we have to fight back.”
In recent days, Tuberville accelerated his assaults. On Sunday, Tuberville’s Facebook account posted a statement that said Islam is “not a religion. It’s a cult.” and claimed that “Islamists aren’t here to assimilate. They’re here to conquer.”
“Stop worrying about offending the pearl clutchers,” the statement said. “We’ve got to SEND THEM HOME NOW or we’ll become the United Caliphate of America.”
The actions of the Council on American-Islamic Relations came on the heels of another post from on X, formerly Twitter, that mass migration of “Islamic extremists destroyed Europe” that reinforced a 15-minute speech he gave on the floor of the U.S. Senate on Thursday when he said that the country will soon be known as the “Caliphate of America.”
“They turned a blind eye like we are at the moment and are going to have to fight in the streets to get their countries back,” Tuberville said of Europe about Muslim immigrants. “It’s coming. And that is exactly what’s going to happen in this country in a few short years if we don’t act now to save our country and our way of life.”
Tuberville made multiple remarks disparaging immigrants, making claims that immigrants from Somalia living in Minnesota are stealing from taxpayers and sending the money to terrorists in that country. Tuberville provided no evidence for his comments. Most people of Somali descent are citizens, and Republicans including President Donald Trump have made wildly inaccurate claims about the Somali-American community in Minnesota.
He also referred to the Islamic Academy of Alabama, which withdrew a proposal relocate to Hoover amid criticism and threats.
“I was asked about it,” Tuberville said during his comments on Thursday. “And I said the only place this Islamic academy should be moving is out of Alabama and out of our country.”
A spokesperson for the school declined to comment on Tuberville’s statement, referring instead to a news release published after the Hoover planning and zoning committee denied the school’s proposal to move its site from Homewood.
“Not one word of these allegations reflects the teachings, values, curriculum or culture of our school,” Stacy Abdein, the school’s assistant principal said in the news release. “They are irresponsible fabrications that fuel fear, prejudice and division.”
Jones defended the school on Monday.
“These are not indoctrination academies,” he said. “These are schools that teach children how to read, how to write, to do math, to do all the things, but they also teach them their religion.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/20251016_090716-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-12-16 08:56:24.760608

One assumes that its faculty and administrative cadre are saturated with extremely bright people. Nevertheless, UC has succumbed to a managerial disease that has afflicted other corners of state government — the chronic inability to successfully adopt information technology.
The state has spent billions of dollars on high-tech projects meant to make state agencies more efficient and responsive. But those efforts have either failed completely, worked only partially or couldn’t meet implementation deadlines.
The syndrome has afflicted many agencies. The most obvious example is the Financial Information System for California, with the catchy abbreviation of FI$Cal. 
It was supposed to be a one-stop financial management tool. But since FI$Cal launched in 2005, it has consumed more than a billion dollars and is not likely to be completed until sometime in the next decade. 
It’s a bureaucratic zombie, not quite alive but not quite dead.
‘Glitches and bad data’
UC’s attempt to upgrade its pension system echoes that experience. As described in an article by Politico, a website devoted to politics:
“In April 2019, the University of California unveiled a new computer program that school officials promised would overhaul its clunky, outdated system for disbursing pension payments to more than 150,000 former employees.
“Glitches and bad data, however, marred the launch, delaying payments and causing other problems. Now, six years later, the university is still embroiled in a bitter legal fight with the contractors it hired to build the system, claiming the companies repeatedly misled and defrauded the university.”
The companies said the allegations — and the university’s demand for tens of millions of dollars in damages — are baseless. One company called the protracted legal battle a “vindictive crusade.”
UC manages its own pension system, with more than $100 billion in assets, delivering benefits to 151,000 former employees, ranging from retired university chancellors to former janitors.
Twelve years ago, UC officials awarded contracts to two companies, Sagitec Solutions and Linea Solutions, worth $28 million to upgrade the pension system’s outdated computer system. 
When the upgrade was tested a half-decade later, chaos erupted. Pension payments weren’t delivered on time, pension calculations were riddled with errors, UC retirees pelted the system’s administration with complaints, and the contractors and UC executives began pointing fingers of blame at each other.
UC accused the vendors of shoddy work. The vendors complained that UC officials muddied the waters with requests for multiple changes as the system was being installed. The conflict is still in the courts.
Troubled tech
UC’s failed tech project follows the pattern of other troubled efforts to use information technology over the last couple of decades.
I once asked an acquaintance who sold computer software to state agencies why so many systems failed. He said bureaucrats often don’t know what they want and are rarely conversant about tech capability, leading to misunderstandings about what will be done.
When the list of troubled projects began to stack up, the Legislature and the governor created the California Department of Technology to oversee tech adoption. However, two years ago State Auditor Grant Parks issued a sharply worded report on its shortcomings.
“CDT has broad responsibility and authority over nearly all aspects of IT (information technology) in the state, including providing strategic direction, assessing IT security, and performing project oversight,” Parks told the Legislature. “However, it has not fulfilled important responsibilities in these areas, resulting in significant consequences for the state.”

The friend’s Guatemalan tenant, who didn’t know she was pregnant, had just delivered a premature baby in the New Orleans house. The parents lacked legal residency, and the mother refused to go to a hospital for fear of being detained by federal immigration officers.
“There’s blood everywhere, and the baby’s dead,” Rosales-Fajardo recalled her friend saying. Rosales-Fajardo put on her sandals, grabbed surgical gloves, and rushed to the house.
Rosales-Fajardo, herself an immigrant from Brazil, is a grassroots organizer and advocate in the New Orleans East community, where many immigrants live. She has no formal medical training, but she has experience with delivering babies.
She scanned the room when she arrived. A 3-year-old child stood to one side while the mother sat on the edge of the bed. The father held their swaddled newborn son, who wasn’t breathing and was wrapped in blood-soaked towels.
“The baby was completely gray,” Rosales-Fajardo later said.
Rosales-Fajardo wiped fluid away from his small mouth and rubbed his back before performing tiny chest compressions and breathing air into his lungs.
She told the parents she had to call 911 to get the mother and newborn to a hospital for care. The baby was out, but the delivery wasn’t over.
“I assured her. I promised her that she was going to be safe,” Rosales-Fajardo said.
Fear hung over the room. Still, she made the call and continued performing CPR. Finally, the newborn revived and squirmed in Rosales-Fajardo’s arms. When the ambulance arrived, the mother tried to keep her husband from riding with her, terrified they would both be arrested.
He went, anyway.
“These are hard-working people,” Rosales-Fajardo said. “All they do is work to provide for their family. But they were almost at risk of losing their child rather than call 911.”
Putting Safety Over Health
Nearly two weeks into the Department of Homeland Security’s Operation Catahoula Crunch, which launched Dec. 3, health professionals and community advocates in Louisiana and Mississippi report that a significantly higher-than-usual number of immigrant patients have skipped health care appointments and experienced heightened stress levels.
According to a press release, DHS said it had arrested more than 250 people as of Dec. 11. Though federal officials say they’re targeting criminals, The Associated Press reported that most of the 38 people arrested in the first two days of the New Orleans operation had no criminal record.
Since President Donald Trump took office in January, immigrant families nationwide have become more likely to skip or delay health care, due in part to concerns about their legal status, according to a recent survey by KFF and The New York Times.

The survey found that nearly 8 in 10 immigrants likely to be living in the U.S. without legal permission say they’ve experienced negative health impacts this year, from increased anxiety to sleeping problems to worsened health conditions such as high blood pressure or diabetes. The federal immigration raids in California, Illinois, North Carolina, and now Louisiana and Mississippi add to the health care barriers that these families already face, including access to services, language barriers, lack of insurance, and high costs. That hesitancy to receive even emergency care appears justified amid the ongoing raids.
Hospitals and health facilities generally must allow federal agents in areas where the public is allowed, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. In California this year, federal agents have staked out hospital lobbies, shown up at community clinics, and guarded detainees in hospital rooms. Even driving to and from appointments poses a risk, as traffic stops are a popular place for immigration agents to make arrests.
University Medical Center nurse Terry Mogilles said that immigrants typically make up at least half the patients in her orthopedic trauma clinic in New Orleans, many of them with construction-related, bone crushing injuries that require surgery. But now, Mogilles said, many of those patients aren’t coming in for follow-up appointments, despite the risk of infection.
“When we call, we can’t get through,” Mogilles said. “It is so upsetting because we have no idea what’s happening to them post-op.”
A Chill Spreads in the South
Federal officials said the Catahoula Crunch operation extends to southern Mississippi, though the bulk of the initial arrests have occurred in the Greater New Orleans area. Immigrant families throughout Mississippi are hunkering down in anticipation.
Michael Oropeza, the executive director of El Pueblo, a nonprofit serving low-income immigrant communities in Biloxi and Forest, said the organization has witnessed families delay care, cancel children’s checkups, and go without refilling medication.
“It’s not because they don’t value their health; it’s because they don’t feel safe,” Oropeza said. “When hospitals and clinics are no longer that safe place, people withdraw trust that took years to build up. It can disappear overnight.”
Maria, a Biloxi resident from Honduras, said, in Spanish, she and her two children have missed routine doctors’ appointments because they are “terrified” to leave the house amid an increased presence of federal immigration officers. Her husband, who is authorized to work in the U.S., was detained for two months this year.
Her children are U.S. citizens. They previously qualified for Medicaid, but Maria opted to disenroll them three years ago out of concern that using public benefits would jeopardize her family’s residency applications, she said. The family now pays for their children’s care out-of-pocket.
When it feels safe to attend doctors’ appointments again, Maria said, her priority will be seeking mental health care to address the stress her family has endured.
“I definitely need to see a doctor to get checked out, because I don’t feel well,” she said, describing her anxiety, depression, and insomnia.
In Louisiana, Marcela Hernandez of Familias Unidas en Acción, a nonprofit that provides direct aid to immigrants, said many of the families she works with live paycheck to paycheck. Sheltering at home and missing work only adds to the stress. Hernandez said she received 800 calls for food in two days from families afraid to leave home.
The federal operation in Louisiana and Mississippi could last more than two months, according to the AP. The longer it goes on, Hernandez said, the more she worries evictions will come next as people can’t pay rent, further traumatizing a community whose members often had to make difficult and dangerous journeys to flee hardships in their countries of origin to reach the U.S.
“You don’t leave your country knowing that you’re gonna get raped on the way just simply because you wanna come and meet Mickey Mouse,” she said.

Rosales-Fajardo, who runs a nonprofit called El Pueblo NOLA, said families tell her how children have started urinating on themselves due to stress and fear. Nationally, immigrants who are likely to lack legal status report that some of their children have had problems sleeping and that they’ve seen changes in school performance or behavior, according to the KFF and New York Times survey.
Community groups said they hope people step up locally to deliver food and hygiene products to immigrant homes, and that health care professionals provide more at-home or telehealth visits.
Like at other hospitals, UMC’s waiting rooms are considered public spaces, Mogilles noted. But the nurses union is calling for the hospital to create safe spaces for patients that federal agents can’t access and clearer policies to protect health care workers who shield patients. Post-op appointments can’t be done virtually, so patients need to feel safe enough to come in, Mogilles said.
Prenatal and postnatal care is also challenging to provide virtually, leaving the health of new and expecting mothers vulnerable, said Latona Giwa, the executive director of Repro TLC, a national sexual and reproductive health training nonprofit.
Since the Chicago immigration sweeps began in September, Giwa said, the clinics and health providers her organization works with have reported that 30% of patients had missed appointments. She said pharmacies saw a 40% drop in medication pickups.
“What we know about management of chronic conditions, especially in pregnancy, but in general, is that even missing one appointment can impact the trajectory of that condition and worsen a patient’s outcomes,” Giwa said.
In Louisiana, which already has poor maternal health outcomes, the fear of arrest could exacerbate the crisis worsened by the overturning of Roe v. Wade and threaten lives. She’s especially concerned about families with preterm babies in the neonatal intensive care unit, or NICU.
“Imagine your child is in the hospital, and so vulnerable, and you are terrified to go visit and care for your newborn infant because you’re worried about being deported,” Giwa said, noting that a newborn’s health partly relies on parental visits.

That’s the position the Guatemalan family in New Orleans is navigating.
On a recent day in December, Rosales-Fajardo acted as the family’s translator and advocate on their first visit to see their son in the NICU at a hospital on Lake Pontchartrain’s Northshore. Hospital staffers told the parents they would need to make the long and risky trip to the hospital repeatedly for at least a month to provide skin-to-skin contact and breast milk.
Rosales-Fajardo drove the parents, who were afraid to travel alone out of fear of being pulled over and arrested on a bridge. She said she’ll keep driving them as long as she needs to.
“Whenever they see a Hispanic driving or anything like that, that’s suspicious to them,” she said of federal agents.
But the baby is safe and healthy. And the parents have named Rosales-Fajardo his godmother.

(Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)About 130,000 Alabamians could lose health care coverage or pay significantly higher premiums at the start of 2026 after Congress failed to pass an extension on tax credits for Affordable Care Act (ACA) plans last week.
Theresa Lau, senior policy counsel for the Southern Policy Law Center (SPLC), said in an interview Monday that about 446,000 Alabamians, nearly all of the state’s ACA enrollees, qualify for an enhanced premium tax credit. The tax credits do not have an income cap, but Lau said that enrollees that fall on the lower end benefit the most from the tax credits.
“It’s meant to benefit anyone who is able to get their coverage on the marketplace, but primarily it helps folks with the lowest incomes,” Lau said.
The vote on a one-year extension was a condition for Senate Democrats to reopen the federal government in November. 
“There’s been a lot of back and forth about how there is supposed to be a health care vote that would actually fix health care, that would actually be able to protect folks from losing coverage,” Lau said. “The reality is the only viable solution that would help people now, with the expiring ACA tax credits bookend of the year, is to extend the ACA subsidies.”
U.S. Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., cited the cost of the extension for her vote to not extend the tax credits. 
“Their plan props up a broken, unaffordable system that’s wrought with fraud and failing the Alabamians who truly need it, all while extending COVID-era subsidies with no income caps,” Britt said in a statement.
According to the Bipartisan Policy Center, the one-year extension would cost $23.4 billion, with the financial benefits primarily reaching individuals with incomes under $200,000.
U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell, D-Tuscaloosa, condemned the vote in a post to social media.
“Many will find themselves one diagnosis away from bankruptcy,” she wrote. “Once again, Trump and Republicans have proven themselves utterly incapable of addressing our nation’s affordability crisis.”
Lau said that ACA enrollees will not be automatically dropped from their plans, but many will opt out because of the cost of monthly premiums. She said that a 60-year-old couple making $85,000 per year in Alabama would see their premium increase from $0 per month to $1,876 per month.
“That’s a huge jump, and it makes it completely unaffordable for people to continue to have health care,” Lau said. “People will have to make a decision on whether to keep going with their plan, or to go without.”
She said many may drop their ACA plans because health insurance is not an immediate need.
“People have to make different decisions. A lot of people I feel like oftentimes will forgo healthcare because it’s not an immediate need, whereas, rent and food are definitely immediate needs,” Lau said.
While managing the cost of ACA plans is up to the federal government, Lau said that states that have not expanded Medicaid are disproportionately impacted by the lack of tax credits. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, about 107,000 Alabamians are enrolled in ACA marketplace plans that would qualify for Medicaid in a state where it is expanded.
“Alabama has not extended Medicaid, which would help the population that is right above the poverty line,” Lau said.
SPLC, Alabama Arise and Democratic politicians and candidates have advocated for Medicaid expansion for years. 
There is still time for Congress to address the rising cost of health care. A House GOP bill introduced last week would appropriate funding for cost sharing reduction payments that would reduce health insurance premiums and stabilize the individual market starting in 2027. 
“It’s not going to be something that can be implemented immediately, as well as, any of the changes to cost sharing, all that stuff requires time and process,” Lau said.
She said a “clean extension” of the ACA tax credits is the only option to keep people from losing their health coverage.
“There’s still an opportunity to try to fix this,” she said. “That’s really the most viable solution we can get right now to try to prevent folks from losing coverage.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_0450-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-12-16 08:56:24.760608

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)We’ve been here before: congressional Democrats and Republicans sparring over the future of the Affordable Care Act.
But this time there’s an extra complication. Though it’s the middle of open enrollment, lawmakers are still debating whether to extend the subsidies that have given consumers extra help paying their health insurance premiums in recent years.
The circumstances have led to deep consumer concerns about higher costs and fears of political fallout among some Republican lawmakers.
According to a KFF poll released in December, about half of current enrollees who are registered to vote said that if their overall health care expenses — copays, deductibles, and premiums — increased by $1,000 next year, it would have a “major impact” on whether they vote in next year’s midterm elections or which party’s candidate they support.
For those caught in the middle — including consumers and leaders of the 20 states, along with the District of Columbia, that run their own ACA marketplaces — the lack of action on Capitol Hill has led to uncertainty about what to do.
“Before I sign up, I will wait and see what happens,” said poll participant Daniela Perez, a 34-year-old education consultant in Chicago who says her current plan will increase to $1,200 a month from about $180 this year without an extension of the tax credits. “I’m not super hopeful. Seems like everything is in gridlock.”
In Washington, as part of the deal to end the recent government shutdown, a Senate vote was held Dec. 11 on a proposal to extend the subsidies. Another option, which was advanced by Republicans and included funding health savings accounts, was also considered. Neither reached the 60-vote mark necessary for passage.
On the House side, Speaker Mike Johnson plans to bring to the floor a narrow legislative package designed to “tackle the real drivers of health care costs.” It would include expanded access to association health plans and appropriations for cost-sharing reduction payments to stabilize the individual market and lower premiums. It would also increase transparency requirements for pharmacy benefit managers. Like the bill put forward by Republicans in the Senate it would not extend the ACA’s enhanced subsidies. Lawmakers are likely to vote on such an extension at some point.
In general, Democrats want to extend the life of the more generous subsidies, created in response to the covid pandemic. Those are set to expire at the end of the year. Republicans are split, with many balking at the cost of a straightforward extension, as well as the policy and political implications that might come with a vote to buttress Obamacare, which many have long viewed as public enemy No. 1.
And a few back various proposals that would extend the tax subsidies, fearing that failing to do so will result in political fallout in next year’s midterm elections.
The result is that differing policy positions are being advanced by lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and in both chambers of Congress.
The White House, though supportive of HSAs in principle, has not made clear its choice among the various Capitol Hill plans.
Meanwhile, the clock is ticking for shoppers. People needed to choose their ACA plan before Dec. 15 for coverage to begin Jan. 1. Open enrollment continues in most states until Jan. 15 for coverage beginning Feb. 1.
The marketplaces, too, must have contingency plans in case Congress intervenes. These adjustments could take days or weeks.
“We have a plan on the shelf” to go update the website, including notifying consumers of any changes, said Audrey Morse Gasteier, executive director of the Massachusetts Health Connector, a state-based ACA insurance marketplace.
Still, not many working days remain on Congress’ 2025 calendar, and “in many ways, it feels like they are farther apart than they were even a few months ago,” said Jessica Altman, executive director of Covered California, that state’s ACA marketplace.
Waiting for numbers
Both Altman and Gasteier said it’s still too early to tell how final enrollment tallies will come out, but already there are indications of how sign-ups will compare with last year’s record high of about 24 million.
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services on Dec. 5 released figures from about the first month of open enrollment, showing 949,450 new sign-ups — people who did not have ACA coverage this year — across the federal and state marketplaces. That’s down a bit from approximately the same period last year, when there were 987,869 new enrollees by early December.
Up slightly, however, are returning customers who have already selected a plan for next year. That stands at about 4.8 million, according to CMS, compared with about 4.4 million at this time last year.
That initial finding — lower new enrollments but quicker action by some already covered — may reflect that “people who come back early in the enrollment period are those who need the coverage because they have a chronic condition or need something done,” said Sabrina Corlette, co-director of Georgetown University’s Center on Health Insurance Reforms. “So they are more motivated in the front half.”
And the final number of federal marketplace enrollments takes time to shake out. “The rubber meets the road when people have to pay the first premium,” Corlette said. “With the federal marketplace, we won’t know that for some time.”
Some states have also released information from the first few weeks, with the caveat that many people may wait until mid-December or later to make coverage decisions. Affordability has emerged as a pressure point.
In Pennsylvania, for example, in the first six weeks of open enrollment there was a 16% decrease in people signing up for the first time compared with last year, according to data posted by Pennie, the state’s ACA insurance marketplace. For every one of those new enrollments, 1.5 existing customers canceled, Pennie reported.
There were some indicators that income is a factor: Most of those canceling earned 150% to 200% of the federal poverty level, or $23,475 to $31,300 for a single adult.
Most states automatically reenroll existing customers into the same or similar coverage for the following year. Letters and other notifications are sent to consumers, who then can let the coverage continue or go online during the open enrollment period to change their plan or cancel it.
California reported a 33% drop in new enrollments through Dec. 6. And Altman said she’s also seeing some other changes.
She said more people are opting for “bronze”-level plans, which have lower premium payments than “silver” or “gold” plans but also higher deductibles — the amount people have to pay before most insurance coverage kicks in.
Nationally, the average bronze-plan deductible will be $7,476 next year, while silver plans carry an average $5,304 deductible, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
“That people are being forced to opt for plans with really high deductibles is a warning sign,” Altman said.
In Massachusetts, consumer calls to the state’s marketplace in the first month were up 7% over last year, Gasteier said.
Additionally, “our call centers are getting heartbreaking phone calls from people about how they can’t understand how they can possibly remain in coverage,” she said.
Detailing the difference
If the enhanced tax credits expire, Obamacare subsidies will revert to pre-pandemic levels.
Households will pay a percentage of their income toward the premium, and a tax credit subsidy will cover the remainder, with the payment generally made directly to the insurer.
The enhanced subsidies reduced the amount of household income people had to pay toward their own coverage, with the lowest-income people paying nothing. Also, there was no upper limit on income to qualify — a particular point of criticism from Republicans. Still, in reality, some high earners don’t get a subsidy, because their premiums without it are less than what they are required to contribute.
Next year, without the more generous subsidies, those in the lowest income brackets will pay at least 2.1% of their household income toward their premiums, with the highest earners paying nearly 10%. No subsidies would be available for people earning more than four times the federal poverty level, which comes to $62,600 for an individual or $84,600 for a couple.
For those now shopping for coverage, that cap means a sharp increase in coverage costs. Not only have insurers raised premiums, but now that group’s subsidies have been cut entirely.
“They said, based on our salary, we don’t qualify,” said Debra Nweke, who, at 64, is retired, while her husband, 62, still works. They live in Southern California and are looking at coverage going from $1,000 a month this year to $2,400 monthly next year if they stay in the same ACA plan. “How can you have health insurance that is more than your rent?”
Senate Majority Leader John Thune said in early December that Republicans want to find a solution that will lower health care costs, but not one with “people who are making unlimited amounts of money being able to qualify for government subsidies.” He also objected to granting free coverage to those at the lower end of the income scale.
Even those getting subsidies say they are feeling the pinch.
“Our prices are going up, but even at that, I don’t have any other options,” said Andrew Schwarz, a 38-year-old preacher in Bowie, Texas, who gets ACA coverage for himself and his wife. His three children are on a state health insurance program because the family qualifies as low-income. Both Schwarz and Nweke took part in the KFF poll.
Schwarz’s coverage is going from $40 a month this year to $150 monthly next year, partly because he chose a plan with a lower deductible than some of the other options.
Schwarz said that while the health system overall has many problems, Obamacare has worked out for his family. They’ll just have to take the additional cost out of somewhere else in the family budget, he said.

(Courtesy Innovation Law Lab)A federal judge in Albuquerque on Monday ordered the immediate release of an Iranian man held at an Estancia immigration lockup for the last six months, agreeing with his lawyers that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency was not acting quickly enough to deport him to a third country, his lawyers told Source New Mexico.
Hamid Ziaei, 42, came to the United States in 2024 from Iran, where he said he feared retribution after using his platform as a prominent bodybuilder to speak out against the government, his lawyers said. A judge in June 2024 granted Ziaei protection from removal to Iran, but ICE agents arrested him a year later  when he arrived at a scheduled immigration appointment in San Diego.
ICE incarcerated Ziaei at the Torrance County Detention Facility in Estancia soon after his arrest. That’s where he met lawyers from the Innovation Law Lab, based in Portland, Oregon, who in early November filed a petition on his behalf arguing that his continued detention, which they described as “indefinite,” violated his constitutional due process rights.
Newly released data shows sharp decline of inmates at New Mexico ICE facility 

Over the last six months in ICE detention in Estancia, Ziaei did not have adequate food or water, and he grew depressed as he awaited updates about his immigration case or possible release, attorney Tiffany Wang told Source on Monday in an interview after the hearing. His experience is common there, Wang said, and underscores her organization’s push for ICE to close the facility. 
The jail Ziaei is set to leave has been subject to renewed scrutiny for weeks, after an agreement between ICE, Torrance County and CoreCivic, the private company that owns and operates the jail, expired Oct. 31. Since the expiration, the population has sharply declined from up to 700 detainees in May, according to new data. 
CoreCivic spokesperson Brian Todd previously told Source New Mexico that it continues to provide “safe,  humane and respectful care” to detainees despite the contract’s expiration, and that the population may fluctuate week to week but that it’s “nothing out of the ordinary, and our operations have remained unchanged.”
Still no contract for NM ICE lockup, as detainees report interrupted access to ‘vital’ tablets

Wang estimated Monday that only 100 or so detainees are currently incarcerated there at the moment.
“The Torrance County Detention Facility is not fit to hold anybody. Mr. Ziaei has suffered from respiratory issues since the day he was detained in there,” Wang said “He’s not receiving adequate food. His mental health has significantly declined, obviously, both being detained and just the fact that he hasn’t been told anything.”
Judge Matthew Garcia during Monday’s hearing pressed Ryan Posey, a prosecutor with the United States Attorney’s Office in New Mexico, for answers about the government’s efforts to deport Ziaei to a country other than Iran, according to Ziaei’s lawyers. Posey could not say what country the government intended to deport Ziaei to, they said, or when they intended to deport him.
Garcia ordered Ziaei’s release from Estancia within 24 hours, according to a summary of the proceedings prepared by a court clerk. He said he would issue an order requiring Ziaei’s release by Monday. 
The United States Attorney’s Office declined to comment, a spokesperson told Source on Monday.

(Photo: Alex Wong/Getty Images)President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Dec. 11, 2025, that aims to supersede state-level artificial intelligence laws that the administration views as a hindrance to innovation in AI.
State laws regulating AI are increasing in number, particularly in response to the rise of generative AI systems such as ChatGPT that produce text and images. Thirty-eight states enacted laws in 2025 regulating AI in one way or another. They range from prohibiting stalking via AI-powered robots to barring AI systems that can manipulate people’s behavior.
The executive order declares that it is the policy of the United States to produce a “minimally burdensome” national framework for AI. The order calls on the U.S. attorney general to create an AI litigation task force to challenge state AI laws that are inconsistent with the policy. It also orders the secretary of commerce to identify “onerous” state AI laws that conflict with the policy and to withhold funding under the Broadband Equity Access and Deployment Program to states with those laws. The executive order exempts state AI laws related to child safety.
Executive orders are directives to federal agencies on how to implement existing laws. The AI executive order directs federal departments and agencies to take actions that the administration claims fall under their legal authorities.
Big tech companies have lobbied for the federal government to override state AI regulations. The companies have argued that the burden of following multiple state regulations hinders innovation.
Proponents of the state laws tend to frame them as attempts to balance public safety with economic benefit. Prominent examples are laws in California, Colorado, Texas and Utah. Here are some of the major state laws regulating AI that could be targeted under the executive order:
 Algorithmic discrimination

Colorado’s Consumer Protections for Artificial Intelligence is the first comprehensive state law in the U.S. that aims to regulate AI systems used in employment, housing, credit, education and health care decisions. However, enforcement of the law has been delayed while the state legislature considers its ramifications.
The focus of the Colorado AI act is predictive artificial intelligence systems, which make decisions, not newer generative artificial intelligence like ChatGPT, which create content.
The Colorado law aims to protect people from algorithmic discrimination. The law requires organizations using these “high-risk systems” to make impact assessments of the technology, notify consumers whether predictive AI will be used in consequential decisions about them, and make public the types of systems they use and how they plan to manage the risks of algorithmic discrimination.
A similar Illinois law scheduled to take effect on Jan. 1, 2026, amends the Illinois Human Rights Act to make it a civil rights violation for employers to use AI tools that result in discrimination.
 On the ‘frontier’

California’s Transparency in Frontier Artificial Intelligence Act specifies guardrails on the development of the most powerful AI models. These models, called foundation or frontier models, are any AI model that is trained on extremely large and varied datasets and that can be adapted to a wide range of tasks without additional training. They include the models underpinning OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini AI chatbots.
The California law applies only to the world’s largest AI models – ones that cost at least US$100 million and require at least 1026 – or 100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 – floating point operations of computing power to train. Floating point operations are arithmetic that allows computers to calculate large numbers.
Machine learning models can produce unreliable, unpredictable and unexplainable outcomes. This poses challenges to regulating the technology.
Their internal workings are invisible to users and sometimes even their creators, leading them to be called black boxes. The Foundation Model Transparency Index shows that these large models can be quite opaque.
The risks from such large AI models include malicious use, malfunctions and systemic risks. These models could potentially pose catastrophic risks to society. For example, someone could use an AI model to create a weapon that results in mass casualties, or instruct one to orchestrate a cyberattack causing billions of dollars in damages.
The California law requires developers of frontier AI models to describe how they incorporate national and international standards and industry-consensus best practices. It also requires them to provide a summary of any assessment of catastrophic risk. The law also directs the state’s Office of Emergency Services to set up a mechanism for anyone to report a critical safety incident and to confidentially submit summaries of any assessments of the potential for catastrophic risk.
 Disclosures and liability

Texas enacted the Texas Responsible AI Governance Act, which imposes restrictions on the development and deployment of AI systems for purposes such as behavioral manipulation. The safe harbor provisions – protections against liability – in the Texas AI act are meant to provide incentives for businesses to document compliance with responsible AI governance frameworks such as the NIST AI Risk Management Framework.
What is novel about the Texas law is that it stipulates the creation of a “sandbox” – an isolated environment where software can be safely tested – for developers to test the behavior of an AI system.
The Utah Artificial Intelligence Policy Act imposes disclosure requirements on organizations using generative AI tools with their customers. Such laws ensure that a company using generative AI tools bears the ultimate responsibility for resulting consumer liabilities and harms and cannot shift the blame to the AI. This law is the first in the nation to stipulate consumer protections and require companies to prominently disclose when a consumer is interacting with generative AI system.
 Other moves

States are also taking other legal and political steps to protect their citizens from the potential harms of AI.
Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis said he opposes federal efforts to override state AI regulations. He has also proposed a Florida AI bill of rights to address “obvious dangers” of the technology.
Meanwhile, the attorneys general of 38 states and the attorneys general of the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, American Samoa and the U.S. Virgin Islands called on AI companies, including Anthropic, Apple, Google, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI, Perplexity AI and xAI, to fix sycophantic and delusional outputs from generative AI systems. These are outputs that can lead users to become overly trusting of the AI systems or even delusional.
It’s not clear what effect the executive order will have, and observers have said it is illegal because only Congress can supersede state laws. The order’s final provision directs federal officials to propose legislation to do so.

Only 3.3% of New England is protected wildlands. Experts recommend tripling that while expanding sustainable forestry practices.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Eric Sorenson, Brett Engstrom, and Liz Thompson: We need more wild forests and ecological forestry..","Dear Editor,



We applaud Mr. Riley’s excellent opinion piece on ecological forestry. We share his love of forests.
Forest loss and fragmentation diminish both the vast biological and ecological functions of forests and all the benefits we humans derive from them. Permanent conservation is needed to keep forests as forests.
Ecological forestry, which we fully endorse, is an approach to both maintain forests and to produce the products we need locally.

We also need more wild forests, forests that are allowed to mature with free will, under natural processes and evolving over time. As forests mature, they become more complex biologically and structurally, store vast amounts of carbon and are scientific benchmarks for bettering our understanding of forest ecology and management. Moreover, wild forests and all their inhabitants simply have inherent value. We have a responsibility to protect them.
Wild forests are rare in the region. The 2023 report Wildlands in New England: Past, Present, and Future identified only 3.3 percent of the region as protected wildlands. Both this report and Vermont Conservation Design call for at least 9-10 percent of the landscape to be protected as wildland or old forest. The 2024 analysis and report Beyond the “Illusion of Preservation” identifies three steps for our forests’ future: 1) protect forests (at least 10 percent of the land as wildlands, 70 percent as managed woodlands), 2) reduce consumption by 25 percent, and 3) expand ecological forestry.
We need more wild forests and more ecological forestry, and we have plenty of room for both.

(Photo by Tom Davies/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Leaders of an Indiana group aimed at supporting independent political candidates say the state’s time in the national congressional redistricting spotlight gives them hope that the Legislature will advance election reforms.
On top of Independent Indiana’s list is eliminating straight-ticket voting in which those casting election ballots can vote for all of a party’s candidate with a single push of a button.
Independent Indiana organizers, who launched the group this fall, released Monday a report on the competitiveness of the state’s elections. They said straight-ticket voting is among the greatest obstacles independent candidates face since voters don’t even see the names of those candidates.
A poll conducted for the study found that 62% of voters considered straight-ticket voting a “bad thing,” with 26% in support. The highest level of support was from among Republicans, but they were 36% in favor and 49% against the practice.
Nathan Gotsch, executive director of Independent Indiana, said the secretary of state’s office does not track how many straight-ticket votes are cast statewide.
“But we went through and looked at the top five largest counties in the state and over 50% of voters in the last election in those counties voted straight ticket,” Gotsch said.
Call to eliminate straight-ticket voting
Bills to eliminate straight-ticket voting have been introduced numerous times in the Legislature over the past decade without winning passage.
Such issues have been dismissed in the past as ones of little interest to the public. But that was also the view about a topic like congressional redistricting before the monthslong debate ended with its defeat by the state Senate last week, said Jay Chaudhary, a board member of the nonprofit Center for Independent and Effective Government, which is Independent Indiana’s parent organization.
“Nobody cares about redistricting, right? But we saw the absolute fire storm and really the power of the people in beating that back,” said Chaudhary, who was director of the state’s Division of Mental Health and Addiction under Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb.
Indiana is one of only six states that currently allows straight-ticket voting, according to the group.
Gotsch said a new factor in the straight-ticket voting discussion will be the impact of school board candidates being allowed to list their political party affiliation starting with the 2026 elections. The partisan school board bill adopted earlier this year, however, does not allow straight-ticket votes to count in those races.
“I actually think in a lot of Republican areas, you could find Republican school board members losing because of that under vote,” Gotsch said. “So many people are going in, voting straight ticket and then those Republican school board members are not benefiting from those votes.”
The group is also advocating for a lowering of the signature threshold independent candidates must meet in order to qualify for the election ballot.
Those candidates must now collect petition signatures from registered voters equal to 2% of the most recent secretary of state vote in their district. For a statewide race, that means nearly 37,000 signatures.
Gotsch, who was an independent candidate in 2022 for northeastern Indiana’s 3rd congressional district seat, said that the 2% requirement was enacted in 1980 and creates a barrier for those wanting to run as independents.
Poll finds many voters dissatisfied
Independent Indiana’s report also blames gerrymandering for what it said resulted “in a small, unrepresentative slice of voters effectively determining who ultimately holds most elected offices.”
The report cited the 2024 primaries, in which 17% of Indiana registered voters cast ballots — an estimated 13% in the Republican primary and 4% in the Democratic primary.
The report’s poll found that 53% of overall Indiana voters were dissatisfied with their election choices, with 40% satisfied. Republican voters, however, were satisfied with their choices by a 68%-26% margin.
For political party identification, the poll found:

29% of voters considering themselves Republicans
 15% saying they were independents who leaned Republican
21% said they were Democrats
11% independents who leaned Democratic
15% independents
8% declined to answer

Regarding the state’s major parties:

33% had favorable opinion of the Indiana Republican Party, with 45% unfavorable
25% had favorable opinion of the Indiana Democratic Party, with 43% unfavorable  

The poll, conducted by North Star Opinion Research, was taken of 604 registered voters in early October with a margin of error of 3.99%. North Star regularly polls for GOP candidates and national Republican committees.

While 58% of military veterans treated between 2002 and 2015 had a diagnosed mental health disorder, less than half of U.S. vets seek out treatment due to the cost, lack of availability and stigma. In response, mental health professionals, veterans groups and researchers have sought alternatives to in-office treatment, finding positive results with outdoor recreation and exposure. 
Although adventure-based trips like backpacking and whitewater rafting had a positive impact on veterans facing PTSD, anxiety, depression and other conditions, the Sierra Club report notes these programs are only available sporadically. Additionally, many areas lack the natural resources needed for this recreational therapy.

Veterans need access to quality natural spaces near their homes, the report says, emphasizing that this space should be accessible  regardless of transportation availability, connection to organized outings, or their personal economic situations.
Air pollution can also complicate access to green spaces, as many veterans suffer from respiratory and cardiovascular conditions, making them more sensitive to pollutants, preventing them from engaging in outdoor activities. 
The report examined eight cities across the U.S., including Detroit, assessing each based on the amount of vets lacking access to nature, as well as the American Lung Association’s 2025 state of the air grades. 
In its assessment of Detroit, the report notes that its park system is growing, as it encompasses nearly 5,000 acres across 300 parks. While 84% of residents live within a 10-minute walk of a park, 20% of veterans lacked access to nature in their neighborhoods, with the Sierra Club rating the city a “B” for overall nature access.
However, the city’s “F” rating from the American Lung Association, low walkability and poor access to public transit, pose a barrier to veterans’ park access, the report notes.
Additionally, the neighborhoods with the highest concentrations of people of color also had access to 38% less park space than the neighborhoods with the most white residents. Taking all of these factors into consideration, the report gave Detroit a “D” rating overall.

With many veterans facing long-term respiratory, cardiovascular and mental health conditions that can be made worse by pollution, the Sierra Club emphasized the importance of maintaining protections for clean air, water and for public lands, to support nature-based therapy and limit further exposure of veterans to toxic air pollution.
“When parks are closed, air is polluted, or communities near bases suffer environmental damage, veterans—many of whom live in those areas—bear the brunt,” the report states. “Protecting the environment is not just an ecological responsibility; it’s part of the nation’s duty of care to those who served.”
The report also recommends supporting efforts to connect veterans with nature, supporting staffing and funding for public lands, and improving accessible infrastructure in parks and public land.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-15-190946.png,,,2025-12-16 07:56:18.175830

The Lamoille FiberNet communications union district announced last week that it had reached its goal of ensuring every on-grid address within Lamoille County has access to at least one high-speed internet provider.
Over two summers of construction, workers laid 550 miles of fiber, and multi-gigabit-capable service is now available to 5,000 unserved or underserved addresses across the county, according to a press release from the district.

This feat was achieved through a $24 million public-private partnership with Fidium Fiber, now fully retiring the Consolidated Communications brand, announced in fall 2023. The process began a decade ago with the creation of communications union districts across the state, but the project of universal internet access only got off the ground after millions of dollars in American Rescue Plan Act funding flowed into the state during Joe Biden’s presidency.
Although Lamoille FiberNet initially struggled to get off the ground after a proposed partnership with Google fell through, the Fidium partnership, executed by director Lisa Birmingham in consultation with representatives from all of Lamoille County’s ten towns, took advantage of the communication company’s access to the power line infrastructure, which helped ensure the project could be executed relatively swiftly.
The two-year project completed its first and most extensive build-out last fall, and officials celebrated the new “gig towns” of Lamoille County at Vermont State University’s Johnson campus.
A year later, all that was left was to deploy the remaining fiber optic cable. The communications district will now take on the role of oversight and maintenance for the infrastructure that’s been built.

“This achievement represents years of collaboration, persistence, and smart partnership,” Andrew Ross, Lamoille FiberNet chair and Wolcott representative to the board, wrote in a statement. “Our shared goal was simple but ambitious: to make sure every home and business in our territory could connect to reliable, affordable, high-speed internet.”
Offset by grant funding and innovative construction methods, the project was completed under budget and allowed the communications union district to return some of its funding back to the Vermont Community Broadband Board, which has overseen and distributed funding to the effort to get every address in the state high-speed internet.
Lamoille FiberNet’s success is part of efforts to expand internet access across the state. According to broadband board director Christine Hallquist, only 21% of Vermonters had access to fiber-optic internet in 2021, when she was appointed by Gov. Phil Scott. That amount is now up to 72%, with plans to quickly close the gap.
There are about 300 addresses in Lamoille County where the broadband board plans to provide high-speed internet access through its “broadband equity, access, and deployment,” or BEAD, program.
“Our focus over the next year at the Vermont community broadband board is to look at every single location in the state to ensure that nobody’s been overlooked,” Hallquist said.
Hallquist said Consolidated Communications had previously cultivated a reputation for poor service due to the inadequacy of its copper wire infrastructure. Fiber-optic cable, she promised, allows for improved internet access quality in the Fidium era.
The Trump administration’s Federal Communications Commission has departed from the previous administration’s support for fiber optics and instead adopted a policy of encouraging the use of Starlink satellite internet, which is owned by billionaire Trump donor and occasional cabinet member Elon Musk. In March, National Public Radio reported that changes to the BEAD program encouraged the use of federal funds to pay for the adoption of such technology.
Hallquist and the board continue to argue that the BEAD program should be used to bring fiber-optic cable to Vermont’s remaining unserved addresses, arguing that a state as forested as Vermont makes satellite internet ineffective.
“Tree cover in these tight valleys means satellite is not a viable alternative to try to get everybody served in Vermont,” Hallquist said. “It’s better than nothing, but it doesn’t compare to fiber.”

No one has ever accused Jay Ashcroft of being a lefty.
The former Republican secretary of state was a regular source of ire for Democrats during his eight years in office, whether it was how he crafted ballot summaries or his advocacy for things like book bans and voter ID.
But in 2017, when a coalition of labor unions delivered 300,000 signatures to put a right-to-work law on the statewide ballot, Ashcroft followed long-established precedent and suspended the law until voters could weigh in the next year.
It’s what happened in 1981, when James Kirkpatrick — Missouri’s longest-serving secretary of state and the namesake of the building that houses the office — put a new trucking law on hold after signatures were submitted for a referendum. A lawsuit demanding immediate implementation was dismissed.
Or go back to 1952, when the Missouri Supreme Court explicitly said the purpose of a referendum is to suspend or annul a law before it has gone into effect. Allowing a law to take effect and then later be suspended, the court warned, would invite instability and confusion.
For decades, the process has been clear: when citizens gather enough signatures for a referendum, the challenged law doesn’t take effect until voters get a say.
That’s why last week’s decision from Secretary of State Denny Hoskins came as a shock. On the advice of Attorney General Catherine Hanaway, he announced a gerrymandered congressional map would go into effect despite the submission of 305,000 signatures for a referendum.
Hanaway even bragged online: “The Missouri FIRST map is now the law.”
Missouri GOP goes scorched earth to keep its gerrymandered map off the 2026 ballot

A lawsuit is all but certain, and the referendum itself keeps chugging along, with the secretary of state proceeding with signature verification. But the move is the latest example of a “throw everything against the wall and see what sticks” strategy to keep the map away from voters.
But to what end? Does the attorney general really believe she can upend the referendum?
It’s a question I posed to nearly two dozen GOP consultants, lawmakers and lobbyists over the last week, with the overwhelming consensus quickly landing on two motivations.
The first is that the political incentives for Republicans demand a public fight for the Trump-endorsed map, regardless of whether they truly believe they can win. For Hanaway especially — an appointed attorney general hailing from the pre-Trump era of GOP politics — loudly demonstrating loyalty is her best bet to avoid a 2028 primary challenge.
The second is strategic delay. By dragging out the fight as the election calendar tightens, they hope courts will become increasingly reluctant to intervene. Even if that gamble fails, forcing the referendum campaign to spend resources on litigation serves its own purpose.
Whatever the motivation, the effect is the same: subverting Missourians’ constitutional right to check legislative power.
Missouri’s referendum system exists to ensure lawmakers can’t insulate themselves from accountability. When 300,000 people sign their names to challenge a law, they aren’t offering a suggestion. They are exercising a constitutional veto belonging to the voters alone.
Republicans argue the referendum and initiative process has become increasingly influenced by out-of-state special interests. There is some truth to this claim, particularly when it comes to campaign funding. But that doesn’t justify weakening or dismantling a constitutional right that has served voters for generations.
Letting the map remain in effect while signatures await verification is not a conservative reading of the constitution. It is not tradition. And it’s certainly not respect for the rule of law.
It’s a power play — and a particularly revealing one.
As it turns out, it’s easier to fight for one’s principles than to live by them.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54921771475_e3916f919a_c.jpg,,,2025-12-16 07:00:07.664529

Supporters say the law has not kept up with society's caregiving needs. (Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)A state Senate panel advanced a bill Monday that would expand New Jersey’s family leave law to businesses with at least 15 workers, a change from the current threshold of 30 employees.
The bill has seen some changes since it passed the Assembly in February. It had initially lowered the worker threshold to five, to widespread criticism from the business community. Business groups remain opposed, saying that encompassing businesses with fewer than 30 employees would deter hiring and potentially force small businesses to close their doors.
“New Jersey small businesses are already shouldering some of the highest operating costs in the country, including labor, insurance, property taxes, and compliance obligations,” said Amirah Hussain of the New Jersey Chamber of Commerce. “Imposing these mandates introduces a new layer of risk and unpredictability.”
Yarrow Willman-Cole, with consumer advocacy group New Jersey Citizen Action, testified in favor of the bill, saying 1.7 million workers are not covered by the state’s current family leave law.
“We passed paid family leave 17 years ago. It took us 10 years to improve it. It should not take another decade to get this right,” Willman-Cole said. “Our laws should reflect our society’s growing caregiving needs. New Jersey is, in fact, not keeping up.”
The Senate Judiciary Committee’s Republicans and Sen. Paul Sarlo (D-Bergen), the panel’s chair, voted against advancing the bill.
New Jersey law requires that businesses provide eligible workers with up to 12 weeks of paid leave to bond with a new child or to care for a loved one. Workers pay into the fund that pays out benefits, and the benefits are based on a worker’s earnings. Workers’ jobs are protected until their leave ends.
The committee amended the bill Monday to include employees who have worked for a company for six months — current law says 12 months — and for 500 hours, down from 1,000 hours. The bill would take two years to phase in.
Elizabeth Zuckerman of the state chapter of the National Employment Lawyers Association said that whatever “small burden” the bill puts on an employer is justified to keep parents from choosing between bonding with their children or keeping their job.
“We are a pro-family country. We should support our families by allowing employers or encouraging employers to give employees time off when they need to care for a child or a family member,” Zuckerman said.
Businesses remain concerned that the bill would put an “unsustainable burden” on small employers, said Frank Jones with Big I New Jersey, which advises independent and locally owned insurance agencies.
Jones said he supports the goal of the bill to give more workers access to family leave, but when businesses with 15 employees lose one person, it’s difficult for the remaining workers to juggle the work. He also said it would drive up liability insurance costs. He stressed that paid benefits and job-protected reinstatement should be separate issues.
“The mandatory reinstatement requirement, regardless of business conditions, removes the flexibility small business employers need to survive,” Jones said. “Agencies may be forced to permanently restructure or hire to maintain client service, only to face liability for not reinstating later, even if decisions were made in good faith.”

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, is the nation’s largest anti-hunger initiative.
But leaders in Indiana and beyond aim to reshape what recipients can buy, citing poor public health metrics.
“This isn’t the usual top-down, one-size-fits-all public health agenda,” Braun said in a Monday news release. “We’re focused on root causes … and taking on the problems in government programs that are contributing to making our communities less healthy.”

The changes, dubbed “Smart SNAP,” are part of the “Make Indiana Healthy Again” plan launched in April by Gov. Mike Braun’s administration, with celebrity support.
That included an executive order directing FSSA to request federal permission to make the changes. The U.S. Department of Agriculture approved the waiver in May.
Sugary drinks and candy are off the SNAP table beginning Jan. 1.
Those are defined as non-alcoholic beverages with natural or artificial sweeteners. Concoctions with milk or milk substitutes — soy, rice and so on — don’t count, and neither do drinks exclusively sweetened with real fruit or vegetable juice.
That means soda, energy drinks, sports drinks like Gatorade and sweetened iced tea are banned from SNAP uses, but unsweetened iced tea, fruit juice or electrolyte replacement drinks like Pedialyte are still covered, according to FSSA.
Candy, meanwhile, is defined as a preparation of sugar, honey or other sweeteners combined with chocolate, nuts, fruit or flavorings — not including products that require refrigeration.
Candy bars, marshmallows, fruit strips, popcorn and mints meet the definition, per FSSA, but ice cream, fruit itself and potato chips are still allowed.
Effective date nears
The agency has conducted “multiple” meetings with providers and contacted provider associations ahead of the Jan. 1 implementation date, the news release said.
Retailers must update their point-of-sale systems to exclude the soon-to-be restricted items, train staff on the changes and submit proof to FSSA.
Retailers and researchers have criticized the forthcoming bans, arguing it may particularly hurt businesses near state lines, as well as SNAP enrollees who don’t have regular access to a refrigerator, a stove or transportation — limiting their food options to whatever’s shelf stable.
Retailers, researchers criticize Indiana plan to exclude soda and candy from SNAP

More than 570,000 Hoosiers used the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, to help pay for groceries in September, according to the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration.
They were issued a collective $111 million in benefits that month, or an average of about $195.00 per person.
SNAP benefits are provided on an electronic benefits transfer, or EBT, card. It’s used like a debit card and is accepted at most grocery stores.
SNAP enrollees already can’t purchase hot or prepared foods, alcoholic beverages, or tobacco under federal rules.
The benefit is 100% federally funded and administrative costs are split 50% with states — for now.
Indiana will likely be on the hook for more SNAP costs in the future, under President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act.
States will pay a percentage of benefit costs, depending on their error rates, starting October 2027. They’ll have to take on 75% of the administrative costs even sooner, beginning October 2026.
Those changes could cost Indiana up to $264 million more annually, according to FSSA estimates.

(Getty Images)Six Indiana communities were awarded more than $29 million in low-interest state loans for housing-related public infrastructure, the Indiana Finance Authority announced Monday.
It’s the latest round of the Residential Housing Infrastructure Assistance Program, which is intended to boost housing development by helping communities pay for the expensive public infrastructure that new homes require.
The awarded projects include roadways, water and wastewater systems, stormwater management, and utilities, according to IFA, which administers the program.
“Increasing Indiana’s housing supply is essential to supporting our growing workforce and strengthening local economies,” Gov. Mike Braun said in a news release.
“These investments will help communities keep pace with job growth, attract new talent, and ensure more Hoosier families have access to safe, affordable places to live,” he said. “When we expand housing opportunities, we’re laying the foundation for long-term economic success in every corner of our state.”
The awardees are:

Elkhart: $10 million
Fort Wayne: $8.15 million and $1.75 million
St. Joseph and New Carlisle: $4.5 million
Arcadia: $3 million
Austin: $1 million
Attica: $975,000

Communities were picked “based on the need for additional housing inventory to accommodate local job growth,” the news release said. IFA also prioritized loan applications from local governments with “housing-friendly” zoning.
The projects are expected to support more than 1,500 units of housing, according to IFA. A projected 683 will be in rural areas and 882 will be in urban areas. The number of units will be confirmed upon loan closing, agency spokeswoman Stephanie McFarland said.
Under Indiana law, 70% of the funding must go to projects in communities with a population of less than 50,000. The remaining 30% is available for larger communities.
The program is a revolving loan fund. As the money is paid off, it becomes available for future projects.
IFA previously announced awards of about $31 million last spring and $51 million in 2024. The initiative stems from 2023’s House Enrolled Act 1005.

With the loss of enhanced federal subsidies coverage is forecast to decline after rising for several years. (FS Productions/Getty Images)When Chiquita Brooks-LaSure stepped into her job overseeing the federal health insurance marketplace in 2021, about 12 million Americans were purchasing their health coverage there.
By the start of 2025, that number had doubled.
Brooks-LaSure served as the administrator for the federal Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services in the Biden administration. In addition to managing the federal health insurance programs for people over 65 and people living at or below the federal poverty guidelines, CMS also manages HealthCare.gov — the health insurance marketplace created by the 2010 Affordable Care Act.
The purpose of the marketplace was to make it easier for people who had neither employer-provided  health insurance nor  Medicare or Medicaid to purchase a policy that would cover them.
 The ACA set standards for what the insurance plans are required to cover, and it established a system of nonprofit navigators to guide buyers as they sought to match their own health needs with the coverage that was available to them on the marketplace.
Early during President Joe Biden’s term, Congress passed and Biden signed legislation that increased tax credit subsidies making insurance plans purchased at HealthCare.gov much more affordable. Those enhanced tax credits brought in a flood of new insurance coverage.
“By the time we left, there were 24 million people who were enrolled” in marketplace health plans purchased through HealthCare.gov, Brooks-LaSure said during a video call with reporters last week. The call was organized by Opportunity Wisconsin, an economic issues messaging and organizing group aligned with the Democratic Party.
The federal move to give people on marketplace health plans larger  tax credits drove that increase in enrollment, health policy watchers agree.
Now the enhanced tax credits are due to expire at the end of this year. So far attempts in Congress to extend them, whether permanently or even temporarily, have gone nowhere.
On average, Brooks-LaSure said, premiums for 2026 have gone up by 26%. “For many people, they will choose to not buy health insurance coverage at all,” she said. “But others may choose to buy coverage that doesn’t cover all of their health care needs.”
Monday was the first of two red-letter days in the current history of the ACA and the health care marketplace. People hoping to get coverage starting Jan. 1 were required to sign up by the end of the day.
People can still sign up between now and Jan. 15, but policies won’t take effect until Feb. 1.
After four years of increases in the population with health insurance, the Congressional Budget Office has forecast about 4 million people will drop their coverage in 2026 without the higher subsidies.
“For 275,000 Wisconsinites, these tax credits have saved them on average almost $600 every month,” said Sen. Tammy Baldwin in another call with reporters. “Without them, these Wisconsinites will pay double, triple, or even worse for their premiums next year. And for 30,000 Wisconsinites, the price will be just too high. And they’ll choose to go without insurance.”
That was a decision that Shana Verstegen of Madison said she and her husband briefly considered. Verstegen spoke on Baldwin’s call about the choices the couple is having to make on behalf of themselves and their two sons, ages 7 and 10.
She and her husband both work for a small community gym, Verstegen said. Their employer has too few employees to be able to purchase a group health policy, so they went to the ACA marketplace.
This year they pay $460 a month, already a squeeze, but that will increase to more than $700 a month in 2026, she said.
“It’s an amount we just simply can’t afford,” Verstegen said. Realizing that they could not risk the family’s health by going without coverage, they’ve looked at other options — including possibly giving up work that has been a long-term career in order to find a job with employer-sponsored health insurance.
In the end, Verstegen said, the couple decided to increase their work hours and cancel some events in 2026 to save money to afford their higher-priced health plan.
“These are really tough and frustrating emotional and scary choices,” Verstegen said. “We’re a middle-class, healthy, hard-working family and like so many others we’re simply struggling to keep up.”
Forecasts are murky
The most recent “snapshot” from CMS on HealthCare.gov enrollment covers Nov. 1-29 this year. In Wisconsin, it shows enrollment down by almost 4,000 people compared to Nov. 1-30, 2024.
Nationally, however, the numbers are up — 5.76 million in November this year compared with 5.36 million a year ago. There isn’t enough data to confidently forecast a trend, however.
Of the people signing up in November, “a lot of those folks were probably people who already had coverage and were either renewing it or picking a new plan, but there were also likely some new enrollees,” said Louise Norris, a health policy analyst at healthinsurance.org, an insurance information website.
Norris said there could be a large upswing in enrollment ahead of Monday’s deadline for coverage starting Jan. 1. “Then again you’ll see another sort of surge as we get to mid-January” — the Jan. 15 deadline for coverage starting Feb. 1, Norris said.
Both Norris and Brooks-LaSure said that initial enrollment numbers also don’t tell the whole story.
“The people who are enrolling right now are people who absolutely know they need to have coverage,” Brooks-LaSure said. “But the number always drops when people have to pay their premiums. And so, it’s really the number in January, once people are enrolled, that we think that will be the important number to know about coverage.”
People who are not changing plans may be automatically renewed in their current plans, which can explain some of the initial signups, said Brooks-LaSure. In addition, she said, some people signing up may be opting for less expensive — but also less generous — health insurance than they purchased in the past.
HealthCare.gov classifies health plans as Gold, Silver or Bronze. Gold plans have costlier premiums but more generous coverage with lower deductibles and less cost-sharing required of patients. Bronze plans have lower premiums with higher deductibles and more cost-sharing, and Silver plans are in between.
Brooks-LaSure said she has heard anecdotally from people stepping down from Silver to Bronze plans, for example.
“Coverage is really important, of course, but your ability to actually pay when you go to the doctor is equally, if not more, important,” she said. “It may be that we don’t see the drop in the uninsured rate. We see people shifting to less generous coverage.”
Kelley Bruns, a Sawyer County resident who spoke on Baldwin’s call, said she and her husband took that route for 2026.
Bruns said her husband, a veteran and career firefighter, had to end his career early due to work injuries and resulting disabilities.
When the premium for the policy they had in 2025 rose to more than $1,600 a month — 40% of their monthly income — they opted for a less expensive plan for 2026. That plan, however, has copayments of up to $100, a $15,000 deductible and a cap on out-of-pocket expenses of more than $21,000.
“We have to pray we don’t need surgery or any other major medical procedure,” Bruns said, “since our out-of-pocket maximum is almost half of our annual income and would be a catastrophic expense for our family.”

(photo courtesy of Emily Lawhead) Around seven months after an abrupt pause of federal funding sent home students from Nampa’s Centennial Job Corps Center, the program is once again open and enrolling new participants. 
Job Corps is a free residential job training and education program administered by the U.S. Department of Labor for young people aged 16 to 24. 
In May, federal cuts resulted in a “phased pause” at the center, the Idaho Press reported. The U.S. Department of Labor gave Nampa students a June 30 deadline to move out. The action was part of a larger effort to shutter the 123 Job Corps centers across the nation, which serve more than 20,000 students.
There was also a temporary pause in March on processing new student background checks, which slowed down enrollment nationwide, according to Emily Lawhead, spokesperson for the contractor that operates the Nampa center. Background checks have since been reinstated, and the Centennial Job Corps Center in Nampa is again accepting new students, she said. 
The National Job Corps Association, a nonprofit trade organization comprising business, labor, volunteer and academic organizations, sued to block pause on services, the Associated Press reported. A federal judge in June stopped the Department of Labor from shutting down the program, ruling that the federal department’s actions violated congressionally mandated protocol for closing Job Corps Centers, according to the AP. 
Low-income individuals who meet citizenship, residency and background requirements may be eligible to receive free training in programs in advanced manufacturing, health care and information technology. Job Corps also provides housing, meals, transportation, and support services at no cost. 
The Centennial Job Corps Center is the only Job Corps center in Idaho, according to the Department of Labor website. 
“At a time when U.S. employers are urgently seeking skilled workers, Job Corps offers a proven pathway for young people to succeed,” Lawhead said in an email. “… Students earn industry-recognized credentials and graduate ready for high-demand jobs in industries that keep America running.”

(Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images)LINCOLN — Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen might find some federal help in his efforts to steer about $360 million in unspent funds Congress earmarked for rural broadband development in Nebraska toward other uses that his administration argues will boost connectivity.
Chief among Pillen’s ideas is boosting wireless connectivity in rural areas where modern farming and ranching needs require the kinds of internet connections that power precision agriculture demands in a rising age of artificial intelligence and agricultural technology.

Adrian Smith, R-Neb., U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., and U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb. Feb. 5, 2025. (Courtesy of Nebraska Governor’s Office)
The letter asks federal broadband funding officials to allow the funds to be used in precision agriculture, including livestock monitors, remote field and cattle management systems, sensors and guidance systems for automated agricultural equipment.
All five members of Nebraska’s congressional delegation signed onto a letter Tuesday seeking agency help from Arielle Roth, assistant secretary of commerce for communications and information at the National Telecommunications and Information Administration.
The letter was organized by U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., who chairs the Senate Commerce Committee’s Telecommunications and Media Subcommittee. Among the Nebraskans in Congress, she and U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., voted for the 2021 infrastructure bill. U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., and U.S. Reps. Mike Flood, R-Neb., and Adrian Smith, R-Neb., joined the letter this week.
Fischer, as part of the infrastructure bill that passed under the Biden administration, supported parts of the infrastructure law that focused on rural broadband, including the last mile between connection nodes and the people and businesses needing broadband. The letter cites language from the broader law to seek the funds.
The delegation letter calls for Roth and NTIA to clarify how states can use any funds not obligated under the state’s approved plan for the Broadband Equity Access and Deployment program, or BEAD. Some supporters of fiber broadband connections have questioned Nebraska’s approach.
“The statutory allocation framework assumes that funds are first applied toward deployment, and only after those priorities are satisfied do remaining resources become available for alternative, ‘non-deployment’ uses,” the delegation wrote.
“Given this structure and the express purpose of BEAD as a historic investment to close the digital divide, we request clarification on how NTIA intends to ensure that non-deployment funds are used appropriately to expand connectivity across the nation.” 
The Pillen administration’s plan for the broadband funds, the broad outlines of which the federal government recently approved, would spend $44.5 million of the $405 million Nebraska was awarded through BEAD. The governor has said he would like the state to be able to spend the remaining funds on precision agriculture and other similar efforts. Doing so would require federal approval. 
Advocates say Nebraska missed golden opportunity to expand rural broadband

State officials have argued that rules for spending the broadband funds were tightened in the middle of the process, limiting which addresses they could help with built-out broadband, because some were served in other ways. Critics worry the state might lose the remaining funds.
Pillen and his team have argued the money should be made available for the last-mile connections that matter to farm and ranch families and people for whom traditional fiber broadband connections might be prohibitively expensive.
The plan’s critics have argued that his more reserved approach to spending the funds and his willingness to allow a mix of wireless and wireline broadband will leave some Nebraskans with second-class connections in a digital economy that demands access.
State Sens. Jana Hughes of Seward and Wendy DeBoer of Omaha joined a bipartisan group of more than 160 state lawmakers nationwide last week in a similar letter to Roth and U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick to release the non-deployed BEAD funds.
“We respectfully ask that the Department of Commerce act swiftly to release non-deployment funds so that states can complete the job of closing the digital divide,” the Dec. 9 letter said. “Bipartisan leaders at every level — governors, members of Congress and state legislators — support unlocking these funds. 
“To do otherwise would ignore the law and leave rural and disconnected Americans behind.”

(Photo by Jub Rubjob/Getty Images)Many Oklahomans and individuals across the country may soon find themselves in need of a place to call home as nonprofit and community leaders scramble to shift resources and find new funding for housing programs that have been cut drastically and suddenly by the federal government, despite decades of research that support their use.
The policy change, announced in a 128-page notice issued in November by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), marks a generational shift away from a “Housing First” approach supported for decades by HUD’s own data.
“Housing First” is grounded in the idea that housing provides a foundation for addressing other issues, including substance use disorder or mental health treatment needs. Managing health conditions, medication and employment assistance is made easier when an individual has a safe, secure place to store their belongings. Research has long shown that this model helps individuals maintain autonomy, empowering them to achieve stability on their own terms. By contrast, “Treatment First” requires individuals to earn housing by participating in a predetermined treatment program. It also provides challenges for social service providers, who must locate an individual whose campsite may be transient from one night to the next.
HUD has long promoted the Housing First model, based on evidence that it offers greater long-term housing stability when compared to the “Treatment First” model, especially among people experiencing chronic homelessness. The Housing First approach is particularly beneficial for individuals with a variety of vulnerabilities, including veterans, which have seen a 55.6% decrease in homelessness since 2010,  and people with a history of substance use, mental illness challenges, domestic violence, and chronic medical conditions. The approach is good for taxpayers too, as successful Housing First programs save money as a result of shorter stays in hospitals, residential substance use programs, and prisons while decreasing interaction with police and other emergency services.
But in November, HUD issued a memo mandating a shift in resources by placing a 30% cap on the amount of money communities can spend on long-term housing programs. Key to Home, the public-private partnership that oversees Oklahoma City’s network of homeless service providers,  reports that the city spends approximately 77% of its allocated Continuum of Care funding on housing initiatives. The majority of those funds go to permanent supportive housing for chronically homeless individuals with disabilities, supportive housing for those with mental health challenges and rapid rehousing projects for families. These programs will have to adapt to meet the new federal requirements or lose funding altogether.
Instead, the new plan will prioritize funding for short-term housing conditional on work and mandated treatment requirements. Federal funds will be directed toward helping police dismantle homeless encampments and forcing those experiencing homelessness to undergo treatment for mental health and substance use, despite decades of data showing this approach is neither successful nor safe.
It is also unclear how treatment services will be funded, and Oklahoma is among many states across the country where access to mental health and substance use treatment is severely limited due to a lack of state funding. The Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Use Services was recently forced to cut more than 300 mental health service provider contracts totaling more than $40 million, making already scarce services less available across the state.
So while the federal government is issuing mandates that housing programs must require treatment for residents, there simply are not enough providers available to meet the need, nor are there state dollars available to pay the providers for services, which were previously offered as an option but not mandated.
Critics are rightly concerned that those who do not agree to forced treatment will now have few options for safe, stable housing – creating additional danger for individuals and the community at large.
Additionally, the changes to the federal housing plan do nothing to address other significant root causes of homelessness, including the ever-growing cost of living amidst a federal minimum wage that has been stagnant at just $7.25 since 2009. It’s worth noting that while the minimum wage hasn’t gone up in 16 years, the price of the average home has risen by approximately 165% according to Census.gov.
All of this means deeper challenges for the nonprofit community working in partnership with policymakers, donors and city leaders to address a growing homeless population amidst an administration with a markedly different take on how to address these challenges.
As we struggle with this shift, we must not settle into what may become a false sense of comfort; we may see fewer homeless encampments as these policies push people into short-term shelters or the shadows. But until we tackle the real challenges – a living wage, funding for treatment services and the skyrocketing cost of homeownership, we aren’t truly doing all we can to address homelessness in our community. These are big problems requiring big solutions; we can tackle them together, but we must first commit to recognizing their complexity and handling them – one at a time, and with care.

Much of Wyoming outside of Yellowstone and Grand Teton also struggles with emergency response time.
The post Barrasso bill aims to improve rescue response in national parks appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming’s U.S. Sen. John Barrasso is pushing legislation to upgrade emergency communications in national parks — a step he says would improve responses in far-flung areas of parks like Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks. 
“This bill improves the speed and accuracy of emergency responders in locating and assisting callers in need of emergency assistance,” Barrasso told members of the National Parks Subcommittee last week during a hearing on the bill. “These moments make a difference between visitors being able to receive quick care and continue their trip or facing more serious medical complications.”
The legislation directs the U.S. Department of the Interior to develop a plan to upgrade National Park Service 911 call centers with next-generation 911 technology. 
Among other things, these upgrades would enable them to receive text messages, images and videos in addition to phone calls, enhancing their ability to respond to emergencies or rescues in the parks.

Each year, rangers and emergency services respond to a wide range of calls — from lost hikers to car accidents and grizzly maulings — in the Wyoming parks’ combined 2.5 million acres. 
Outside park boundaries, the state’s emergency service providers also face steep challenges, namely achieving financial viability. Many patients, meantime, encounter a lack of uniformity and longer 911 response times in the state’s so-called frontier areas. 
Improving the availability of ground ambulance services to respond to 911 calls is a major priority in Wyoming’s recent application for federal Rural Health Transformation Project funds. 
Barrasso’s office did not respond to a WyoFile request for comment on the state’s broader EMS challenges by publication time. 
The bill from the prominent Wyoming Republican, who serves as Senate Majority Whip, joined a slate of federal proposals the subcommittee considered last week. With other bills related to the official name of North America’s highest mountain, an extra park fee charged to international visitors, the health of a wild horse herd and the use of off-highway vehicles in Capitol Reef National Park, Barrasso’s “Making Parks Safer Act” was among the least controversial. 
What’s in it 
Barrasso brought the bipartisan act along with Sens. Angus King (I-Maine), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) and John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.). 
The bill would equip national park 911 call centers with technological upgrades that would improve and streamline responses, Barrasso said. He noted that hundreds of millions of visitors stream into America’s national parks annually. That includes more than 8 million recreation visits to Wyoming’s national parks in 2024. 
“Folks travel from across the world to enjoy the great American outdoors, and for many families, these memories last a lifetime,” he testified. “This is a bipartisan bill that ensures visitors who may need assistance can be reached in an accurate and timely manner.”

The Park Service supports Barrasso’s bill, Mike Caldwell, the agency’s associate director of park planning, facilities and lands, said during the hearing. It’s among several proposals that are “consistent with executive order 14314, ‘Making America Beautiful Again by Improving our National Parks,’” Caldwell said. 
“These improvements are largely invisible to visitors, so they strengthen the emergency response without deterring the park’s natural beauty or history,” he said.
Other park issues 
National parks have been a topic of contention since President Donald Trump included them in his DOGE efforts in early 2025. Since then, efforts to sell off federal land and strip park materials of historical information that casts a negative light on the country, along with a 43-day government shutdown, have continued to fuel debate over the proper management of America’s parks.  
Several of these changes and issues came up during the recent National Parks Subcommittee hearing.

Among them was the recent announcement that resident fee-free dates will change in 2026. Martin Luther King Day and Juneteenth will no longer be included in those days, but visitors won’t have to pay fees on new dates: Flag Day on June 14, which is Trump’s birthday and Oct. 27, Theodore Roosevelt’s birthday. 
Conservation organizations and others decried those changes as regressive. 
At the hearing, Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-NM), assured the room that “when this president is in the past, Martin Luther King Jr. Day and Juneteenth will not only have fee-free national park admission, they will occupy, again, incredible places of pride in our nation’s history.”
Improvements such as the new fee structure “put American families first,” according to the Department of the Interior. “These policies ensure that U.S. taxpayers, who already support the National Park System, continue to enjoy affordable access, while international visitors contribute their fair share to maintaining and improving our parks for future generations,” Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said in an announcement.

The Rock Springs Resource Management Plan, if changed, could jeopardize the Northern Red Desert and Golden Triangle, writes Julia Stuble.
The post Wyoming already put in the work on Rock Springs plan. We should respect it. appeared first on WyoFile .","In Wyoming, we know that good decisions take time. We measure commitment not in months or headlines, but in seasons, communities and the work it takes to get things right. That’s why the Rock Springs Resource Management Plan — finalized last year after 12 years of public process — deserves to stand. 

Opinion

This plan, which determines the future uses of 3.6 million acres of public land, wasn’t rushed. It was shaped over more than a decade by ranchers, hunters, county officials, wildlife biologists, small businesses and community members with all types of backgrounds who care deeply about these public lands and how future generations will experience them. Public land owners from across the nation weighed in too; the Bureau of Land Management received more than 35,000 comments on the draft, and the overwhelming majority — 92% — supported a balance of conservation, access and responsible energy development. 
And now, barely a year after that thoughtful, Wyoming-driven process wrapped up, the BLM is rewriting it.   
For what reason? There’s no new science. No crisis. No failure of public involvement. Just politics. 
The plan protects the places that define this part of the state — Greater Little Mountain, the Northern Red Desert, the Golden Triangle — while allowing for continued mineral development across more than two-thirds of the affected area. It supports Wyoming’s $1.5 billion outdoor recreation economy and safeguards critical habitat for mule deer, elk, pronghorn and sage grouse. Livestock grazing will continue across the region, as will public access — we can head down the same two-tracks in side-by-sides, on foot or on horseback as we have for decades. Notably, the plan reflects nearly all the recommendations of the governor’s own task force, which included representatives from local government, oil and gas, mining and grazing. 
Some have claimed the plan is “too restrictive.” But that’s hard to believe, since 92% of BLM land in Wyoming is already open to oil and gas leasing. Nationally, it’s 81%. For this plan, it’s 70%.  
The areas prioritized for conservation in this plan have very low potential for recoverable oil and gas, while sustaining our wildlife, hunting opportunities and the open spaces that anchor our local communities. Undermining those benefits based on the hopes of speculators or politicians is not responsible stewardship. It’s shortsighted. 
The BLM has offered a comment period for rewriting the plan and says the changes will be finalized in a year. This kind of rushed amendment cannot substitute for the deep, deliberate process Wyoming already engaged in.  
Adjusting oil and gas availability or altering areas of critical environmental concern affects the entire balance of the plan. That scale of change demands thorough public involvement and analysis. But let’s be honest: None of this reconsideration is necessary. The plan is working. 
Oil production in the United States is at an all-time high. Natural gas production is breaking records. Wyoming continues to be a major contributor to national energy security. Undercutting a community-built plan in the name of an energy emergency that doesn’t exist is not good policy. It’s political theater. 
The Rock Springs plan is more than a document. It is a commitment to stewardship, to wildlife, to local economies and to the Wyoming way of taking the long view for our future. It’s about the freedom to access public lands to hunt and fish, and to pass down open spaces to the next generation. Reopening the Rock Springs plan now would undermine the trust of the people who invested years of their time and experience into shaping it for the benefit of future generations.  
Wyoming did the work. We showed up. We built a plan that reflects our values and our future. That work deserves respect. Tell our leaders to keep protections for the Northern Red Desert, Golden Triangle and Greater Little Mountain by submitting a comment to the BLM.

Congress made a state catastrophic plan necessary when it refused to extend ACA premium tax credits, columnist Kerry Drake opines. 
The post ‘BearCare’ could help Wyomingites who struggle to afford health insurance appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyomingites who need health insurance deserve so much more than the petty partisan bickering in Congress that has given many people only two choices: pay a fortune to keep Affordable Care Act coverage or go without any insurance at all.

Opinion

Wyoming legislators are debating whether to pursue a third option — BearCare, a state-operated, federally funded plan to provide catastrophic coverage against major illnesses and injuries.
Let’s start by justifiably lashing out at the self-serving half-wits in both parties in Washington, who are motivated not by achieving the greater good, but by whether they can pin the blame on opponents.
Wyoming residents are facing the largest premium hikes in the country because Republicans did not extend enhanced premium tax credits past the end of the year. The larger subsidies made ACA marketplace plans affordable; without them, some families will see increases over 400%.
The GOP has tried and failed to repeal the ACA dozens of times, largely because it never offered a better plan. Republicans still haven’t, though you wouldn’t know that by listening to Wyoming’s U.S. Sen. John Barrasso.
Barrasso, a retired physician, should have had a laugh track playing in the background when he said, “The American people can’t afford to pay these high costs for health care. We need to focus on the cost of care.”
Barrasso should focus on the needs of his constituents, all of whom will be paying more for health insurance or doing without it if tax credits are not extended. Private insurance rates are rising, and struggling hospitals will have to grapple with billions of dollars more in uncompensated care.



Perhaps Barrasso thinks his voter base won’t be affected because it gets some kind of MAGA discount on health insurance. Or, more likely, he just doesn’t care what anyone pays because it’s all about his party staying in power.
I have just as much animosity for moderate Senate Democrats who snatched defeat from the jaws of victory last month. Divided Republicans were near folding on tax credits after being rightfully blamed for the unpopular federal government shutdown. 
Then eight Democrats broke ranks with their party by ending the shutdown for the guarantee of a vote on tax credits they would obviously lose.
An anemic Republican plan to spend up to $1,500 for individual health savings accounts — not remotely enough to make a difference — was killed by Democrats. Both parties will try to use their rivals’ incompetence to gain seats in the 2026 mid-term election. A pox on both of them.
Back in Wyoming, the bleak picture for some victims of the failure to extend tax credits was made a little brighter thanks to the state Department of Health, which developed a health plan called BearCare.
No, the plan isn’t named after Rep. John Bear, R-Gillette, of the far-right Freedom Caucus. The moniker is a play on words that would provide catastrophic health insurance that only covers the “bare necessities.” (It’s also the kind of coverage designed for major medical emergencies like, say, a bear mauling.)
As co-chairman of the Joint Appropriations Committee, Bear criticized the plan and suggested it be named after Gov. Mark Gordon, who praised it. I don’t care what it’s called if it helps Wyomingites who don’t deserve the crap sandwich Congress has served them.
BearCare is part of a grant application the Department of Health made to capture some of the $50 billion available to states under the Rural Health Transformation Program.
Wyoming could receive up to $800 million over five years if its total package — which includes plans to stabilize hospitals, bolster preventative health care, grow the workforce and use technology to improve access — is approved later this month. 
Department of Health Director Stefan Johansson asked the Appropriations Committee to create a placeholder in the budget if BearCare gets a paws-up from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Legislature.
Would BearCare be any better than private catastrophic insurance plans that don’t pay for typical care, and have low costs and high deductibles? Bear, the lawmaker, charged it would be a costly government-backed program that’s unsustainable.
But he’s wrong. Johansson described BearCare as an alternative to the ACA marketplace for individuals and small businesses whose premiums are too expensive. Federal dollars would be used as “seed” money to get the optional program started, but eventually, members’ monthly enrollment fees would fund it.
Americans’ health insurance problems won’t be solved short of Medicare for All. BearCare isn’t a magic solution for Wyoming, but it’s worth a try during perilous times for many.
Would I sign up if I had an unaffordable ACA plan and wanted at least some protection from being bankrupted by a major medical emergency?
When I lost my health insurance along with my job in 2013, I couldn’t sign up for the ACA because I didn’t qualify for Medicaid or federal subsidies. I was living on unemployment benefits, had no savings to buy a private plan, and was terrified about not having insurance for my family.
I would have jumped at the chance for BearCare to ease my mind — and help my family in an emergency. Wyoming lawmakers should jump on backing this cost-effective, self-sustaining plan that, with federal support, will cost the state almost nothing to start.

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)The gallery was packed shoulder-to-shoulder Monday morning as Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan entered the courtroom of U.S. District Judge Lynn Adelman not as a judge, but as a criminal defendant. Dugan is accused of obstructing federal agents in their efforts to arrest a Mexican-born man who was in the country without legal authorization, and who appeared in Dugan’s misdemeanor criminal court back in April. If convicted in what Adelman signaled would be no more than a week-long trial, Dugan could face six years in prison.
Attorneys on both sides of the trial painted very different pictures of Dugan during their opening statements, which can include statements which do not have to be demonstrated by evidence. 
The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
Opening statements from prosecutors lasted nearly an hour, with the lawyers saying that Dugan “knew what she was doing was wrong.” Repeatedly, prosecutors pointed to courtroom audio transcribed by the FBI which captured Dugan saying, “I’ll get the heat,” when talking to her courtroom staff about how to respond to the fact that immigration agents were waiting in the hallway to arrest Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, a man appearing before her on misdemeanor charges of battery and domestic violence. 
Prosecutors called the Milwaukee County Courthouse “a safe place where arrests are routine,” allowing federal agents to confront targets who have passed through security screening and are unarmed. An arrest team of six federal agents from the FBI, DEA, Border Patrol, and ICE wearing plain clothes and carrying concealed weapons were attempting to blend into the normal hustle and bustle in the courthouse. Prosecutors said that an FBI agent told a Milwaukee sheriff’s deputy, who was serving as a bailiff for Dugan’s courtroom, that they were there to arrest Flores-Ruiz. “Everything was proceeding in a routine way,” prosecutors told the jury, until the court clerk told Dugan that agents were in the hallway for an immigration arrest. 
Jurors watched mute video compiled from security cameras showing Dugan, accompanied by fellow Circuit Court Judge Kristela Cervera, walking down the public hall in their judge robes to find out what the agents waiting outside the courtroom wanted. Both judges can be seen pointing to the chief judge’s office, with agents then following Cervera to consult with Chief Judge Carl Ashley. 
When Dugan returned to her courtroom she called Flores-Ruiz first out of the at least 33 cases she had on the docket, setting a court date and telling Flores-Ruiz he was welcome to attend remotely over Zoom. After that, prosecutors allege that Dugan and her court staff directed Flores-Ruiz to an exit in the courtroom which led to a non-public hallway. At the end of the hallway Flores-Ruiz could either take a staircase leading down to the fifth floor, or go through a door which led back out to the public hallway where agents were waiting.

Flores-Ruiz and his attorney exited through the door and walked  right past the federal agents. Some of the agents trailed Flores-Ruiz to the elevator, while the rest of the arrest team left Ashley’s office. Cameras outside the courthouse captured agents running down a sidewalk after Flores-Ruiz and his attorney. 
Dugan is accused by prosecutors of “dividing” the arrest team by directing them to the chief judge. They say that Dugan had “strongly held views” about immigration enforcement in courts which led her to “cross the line,” and that the now-suspended judge had “orchestrated” Flores-Ruiz’s “escape from federal law enforcement.” 
Prosecutors claimed Dugan told Cervera to keep her robes on during the interaction, and that Cervera and Flores-Ruiz’s defense attorney Mercedes De La Rosa were both uncomfortable with Dugan’s wishes to confront the agents. 
Dugan’s defense team emphasized that the door Flores-Ruiz used to exit the courtroom was just 11 feet from the courtroom’s main entrance. They also discussed the upheaval the Trump administration’s deportation operations had caused at the Milwaukee County Courthouse before the interaction with Dugan. ICE arrests had occurred in late March and early April, alarming county judges. The defense displayed emails from courthouse personnel they said demonstrated the “paranoid” atmosphere at the courthouse and which described concerns about people not showing up to court and suspicious vehicles parked outside that looked like they belonged to federal law enforcement. 
Courthouse was developing a policy on ICE
At the time of Flores-Ruiz’s arrest, Chief Judge Ashley was drafting a policy on how to respond to immigration enforcement coming inside the courts. Judges had been invited to a training presentation on the matter which Dugan was unable to attend, but she had been briefed on its main points.

The draft policy noted that administrative warrants of the type federal agents presented to arrest Flores-Ruiz are not treated the same way as judicial warrants. Whereas a judicial warrant would give the agents full access to the building, administrative warrants limit them to the public areas of the courthouse. Court staff were also instructed to direct immigration officers to their immediate supervisors, which Dugan appeared to be doing by directing them to Ashley, her attorneys said, adding  that the chief judge needed to be notified if a warrant is executed. 
Ashley had also issued a press release after the rash of ICE arrests saying in part that “the court must remain a safe haven,” Dugan’s attorney Steven Biskupic noted, as images of courthouse emails, messages, and press releases were presented  to jurors on two screens. Dugan did not obstruct the agents, or give direction to anyone else to do so, her attorneys argued. 
Federal agents testify
Three federal agents took the stand Monday and gave lengthy testimony, starting with Erin Lucker of the FBI. Lucker was not involved with the immigration arrest, but helped gather and analyze video and evidence to charge Dugan. Using audio from courtroom microphones, Lucker created a transcript and timeline of events from the time Dugan first approached the agents until Flores-Ruiz was arrested outside. 
The audio was very poor in places, and Judge Adelman reminded the jury that the audio is evidence, not the transcript, and that if they could not understand what is said on the audio, they were not allowed to rely on the transcript instead. In a portion of the audio, Dugan can be heard talking to court staff about the exit to the hallway, with a voice saying “down the stairs,” though some of what’s being said was inaudible. Prosecutors also said that the alleged victims of the domestic violence and battery charges Flores-Ruiz faced were kept waiting in the courtroom to wonder what happened after he left.

In response to questions from Dugan’s defense attorneys, Lucker said she had no firsthand knowledge of the courthouse itself or what business there usually looks like. She had not participated in an arrest team like the one assembled for Flores-Ruiz, she said. She also responded to the defense that she wasn’t aware that before January 2025 immigration enforcement officers did not, as a matter of policy, target people for arrest at courthouses. 
Defense attorneys also pointed out that a video Lucker helped produce shows a walkthrough of Dugan’s courtroom and the non-public hallway outside ends with the filmer walking down the stairs, not taking the entrance to the hallway which Flores-Ruiz took. Lucker said she hadn’t walked down those stairs, and was unaware that to get out of the building you’d need to pass by multiple security checkpoints. 
Testimony revealed that federal agents had been surveilling Flores-Ruiz at his home and followed him to the courthouse. Defense attorneys questioned why a traffic stop wasn’t made. The task force agents used an encrypted Signal chat which they’d named the “Frozen Water Group” to communicate about the ICE operation. 
FBI Special Agent Jeffrey Baker,  one of the plain-clothes agents on the arrest team, testified that he  had only been on the ERO team since February when the team came for Flores-Ruiz in April. Baker said Dugan “divided” the arrest team by leading members into the chief judge’s office, and that when he talked to Dugan “she seemed to be angry at that point.” When he went to Ashley’s office, Baker said he wasn’t told where he was going or why. He was informed that Flores-Ruiz had left the building either by a text or phone call from another agent.
On Tuesday, Baker will be questioned by defense attorneys.

Within the sculpture, Monument to the Immigrant Workers of the Katrina Reconstruction, three construction workers, two men and a woman, lean into their labor.
The Gershaniks, who emigrated from Argentina in the mid-1960s, came home to a flooded New Orleans after Katrina and witnessed the city’s miraculous comeback. “We were able to come back to our homes because Latino immigrants took the risks to rebuild them,” Ana Gershanik said. “Every family I know had immigrant construction workers who were Latino. We owe them so much.”
With Operation Catahoula Crunch underway — in Jefferson Parish suburbs, St. Tammany Parish, and now in Baton Rouge — staff from The Lens drove through New Orleans, chronicling worries and preparations, and gathering an appreciation for the port city’s unique perspectives on immigration.

‘We’re going through a political storm’
At Unión Migrante — a grassroots group of immigrant workers and their families — organizer Rachel Taber uses hurricane language to describe present-day New Orleans, where at-risk workers must stay tucked to stay safe.
“We say we’re going through a political storm,” Taber said. “Everyone in Louisiana knows how traumatic a storm is. You get through it because neighbors help neighbors and because immigrants help rebuild after every storm.”
Those “storm kits” look like this: consult an immigration attorney; make sure everyone has passports; name someone who can pick up your children and sell your car if you’re detained; decide how to move savings out of the country if you have to leave in a hurry.
The fear isn’t abstract, Taber said. In the early days of the ICE occupation, she said, agents arrested two men at a construction site a block from Riverdale High School in Jefferson. Students, hearing rumors of raids, panicked. First, at-risk students called parents to come get them. Then, as they realized the bigger picture, students begged parents not to come after all, for fear they’d be picked up outside the school.
“We’re seeing what feels like psychological warfare against our children,” Taber said. “People are scared to go to the grocery store.”
She and other advocates also described other ongoing patterns, things they’ve seen for years: employers threatening to “call ICE” if workers complain about stolen wages or dangerous conditions or people picked up on their way to surgery for job-related injuries. For fear of bosses calling immigration on them, workers can’t safely report abuse or hazardous conditions, especially in agricultural and construction fields, they said.
“Immigration enforcement is the glove that covers the iron fist of labor exploitation,” Taber said.

People making contingency plans, in case they are taken
As the federal government implements Catahoula Crunch (formerly Swamp Sweep), many Latino families are staying indoors, pulling their kids from schools, stopping church and grocery runs — and making contingency plans in case a parent disappears.
The goal of ICE’s operation is to arrest 5,000 individuals in southeast Louisiana and part of Mississippi.
Aside from a raid at home-repair stores and a saunter through the French Quarter, ICE has mostly been focused on Jefferson Parish, which was also rebuilt post-Katrina by immigrants. But there in Jefferson, ICE agents have full cooperation from law enforcement.
ICE also may have more public support in Republican-heavy Jefferson Parish. Nearly 90% of Orleans Parish residents who identified as Democrats opposed immigration-enforcement efforts, while only 24% of Republican voters in Orleans opposed or strongly opposed it, according to a recent poll by JMC Analytics . Overall opposition, which stood at 79%, did not vary significantly by race, gender or council district, the poll found.

Last week, Liz Murrill, the state attorney general, sent a letter to the New Orleans Police Department, ordering them to cooperate with ICE and to quit following “sanctuary city” policies. In response, NOPD Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick said that she is reviewing the letter and preparing to revise NOPD policies, if there are any that do not fall in line with federal law. But to date, there’s been no obvious visible sign of cooperation between ICE and NOPD officers.
When compared to Orleans, Jefferson has a larger proportion of Hispanic people. More one-fifth of all residents there identify as Hispanic, according to a Data Center analysis of Census data.
Historically, New Orleans, as a port, was a polyglot city, known particularly for its connections to Latin America. But those patterns had withered, since immigration patterns generally follow stronger economies. So for years before Katrina, high-poverty New Orleans offered little opportunity and attracted few immigrants.
After the storm, as construction boomed, the Hispanic population nearly doubled. It now stands at roughly 31,000 people — 8% to 9% of the population.

‘These people are not garbage’
On a recent Sunday, the Rev. Tony Rigoli looked from his pulpit to the now-empty pews where entire families used to sit.
“People are living in fear,” said Rigoli, who has long overseen Our Lady of Guadalupe Church & International Shrine of St. Jude on North Rampart Street.
According to a church spokesperson, attendance at his church’s Spanish-language Mass is down by more than half, he said.
During his interview with The Lens, Rigoli reflected the on scripture Matthew 25, where Jesus asks what we did for “the least of these”—the hungry, the sick, the imprisoned and the stranger.
“At the end of our life, that gospel is going to be our report card,” he said. “When I was a stranger, an immigrant, did you welcome me.”
Beyond his Biblical charge, Rigoli has an immediate empathy for his parishioners because his parents were Italian immigrants, from Sicily, who struggled when they arrived in the United States, he said.
He does not oppose reasonable border control, he said. But he is pained by the feared spectacle of mass arrests conducted under names like Swamp Sweep.
“When I hear those words, Swamp Sweep — a swamp is where garbage goes,” he said. “These people are not garbage. They are my brothers and sisters.”

A bakery half-empty
Jose says he has seen the negative effect of Catahoula Crunch on his sales for nearly a month now. To protect him and his business, The Lens is not using his last name, store name, or location.
Within his small New Orleans grocery and bakery, a produce department offers cactus and plantains. His kitchen cooks up big pots or ceviche and pans of meat pies. The air smells sweet from freshly baked sheet cakes, pan dulce, and churros.
“We’re a Latin-based store; 80% of our clientele is Hispanic,” Jose said. “I want to say at least half of them have stopped coming. People left. People are afraid. Nothing positive is coming out of this.”
There are rumors of bounty hunters and unmarked cars, though he hasn’t seen them yet. When The Lens visited last week, an SUV with dark tint was parked down the block. Customers have also been telling him for the past few months about other New Orleanians who picked up even though they had previously been given time by immigration to get paperwork in order.
To protect his customers and his staff, Jose gently told some at-risk families to stay home, that he would take time after-hours to personally deliver anything they needed.
Yes, the crackdown is putting immigrant families under financial strain. But it’s also affecting the local economy as a whole, he said. At restaurants with shrinking staff, chefs are washing dishes. Across town; landlords are likely to lose tenants. As the holiday season ramps up, hotels are scrambling for housekeepers.
“We live in a touristic city that depends on all of its workers,” he said.
‘Because of what your parents are doing, we have a place to live again’
A few years after Katrina, when Ana Gershanik and her husband first envisioned the immigrant workers monument, it was for the kids.
In local schools where the Gershaniks volunteered, Latino children talked excitedly about becoming doctors, lawyers and engineers, she said. But she also saw mixed feelings, as the children described parents who worked in demolition, carpentry, roofing or drywall.
“Some of them were ashamed,” Ana Gershanik recalled. “We told them, ‘Because of what your parents are doing, we have a place to live again.’ We wanted a place where they could go and say, ‘Those are my parents. I am proud of them.’”
The monument’s three figures were originally all men until she insisted the sculptor add a woman, to reflect the realities of what she’d seen after the storm.
In the early days after Katrina, she said, she drove through the city and heard “Latino radio everywhere,” she said, as men and women replaced blue tarps and turned flooded properties back into homes.
Today many of those workers have settled permanently. Some, like the owners of a construction firm on Earhart Boulevard, started as laborers and now run their own companies.
Others remained undocumented, priced out of the legal process.
They hang drywall in new hotels, mop floors after conventions, cook in French Quarter kitchens and pour concrete for luxury condos. Make no mistake — they are New Orleanians, Gershanik said.

‘We are not disposable’
The injustices of the Catahoula Crunch are impossible to separate from the city’s long-running inequities in labor, policing and incarceration, says Jordan Bridges, organizing director of the New Orleans Workers’ Center for Racial Justice.
Bridges recently launched a campaign called “We Are Not Disposable” that stems from his work following Mardi Gras cleanup workers from parade routes into their homes and neighborhoods, to document the risks they face on the job and off. “Who lives on top of the trash? Who moves the trash? Who enjoys the culture, and who owns it?” he asks.
What Bridges saw as he followed Carnival workers still disturbs him: Workers with Stage 4 cancer sweeping up beads and broken glass in toxic dust, while others are living in precarious housing or relying on temporary gigs.
Federal immigration enforcement is layering a new danger onto the same communities, he said, as he and others at the Workers’ Center worked with Union Migrante and others to help at-risk residents stay at home during the ICE immigration crackdown.
As Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino and his ICE troops moved into town and made a run through all the Lowe’s and Home Depot day-labor spots, Bridges envisioned that New Orleans would continue to see “opportunistic raids” around the city–individual arrests at barber shops, grocery stores and day-laborer corners.
“This is stop-and-frisk by another name,” Bridges said. “As a Black man, I know exactly what that means.”
There’s another obvious parallel. “It’s mass incarceration by another name,” said Bridges, describing how the urban ICE crackdowns dovetailed with the rapid expansion of immigration detention in Louisiana, including the new immigration housing within the Louisiana State Penitentiary in Angola’s Camp J, which was once closed for deplorable conditions.
Whistles and zines: tools of resistance
At a modest house at a not-to-be-identified spot in the city, software engineer Cade Roux has turned his 3D printer into a small, whirring factory.
He’s been churning out plastic whistles by the hundreds, attaching them to lanyards and tucking them into small packets alongside folded “Know Your Rights” zines. The idea came after he read about similar kits being distributed in Chicago and Charlotte.
The whistles are simple: blow if you see what looks like an unlawful arrest or someone in distress; draw attention; get phones recording.
But preparing for alerts in every neighborhood requires a lot of whistles. “People were ordering whistles by the hundreds from Amazon,” he said. “I figured, we can print them here.”
Roux experiments with designs that use as little plastic as possible so that they print quickly and can be produced in volume—two to six grams each. He hands off whistles to organizers who distribute them quietly in areas with high immigrant populations and drops batches into Little Free Libraries around town.

‘We have a duty’
New Orleans is waiting cautiously, knowing that ICE is likely to eventually shift its suburban focus and slam full force into the city. In the meantime, faith communities — Catholic, Methodist, Unitarian, Jewish and Muslim — have been hosting Know Your Rights sessions and discussing sanctuary practices. Legal groups are ready for a flood of calls. Community organizations have been coordinating volunteer drivers, emergency childcare and accompaniment to court.
If we can rely on each while we shelter in place through other storms, organizers say, we can also withstand this.
Bridges believes Black New Orleanians in particular have a role to play, in standing up for those who could – because of one short trip to the grocery –  be taken away from the city. “As descendants of people who resisted all over the world, we have a duty to stand with a community that’s on the front line now,” Bridges said.
Rigoli comes at it from a pastoral aspect. “Lord, enlighten all of us to see that our brothers and sisters are part of who we are,” he prayed at the end of his interview with The Lens. “We say ‘Our Father’, that means we have the same Father. So we must be brothers and sisters.”
For Ana Gershanik, it comes back to the symbolism of the bronze at Crescent Park.
“I want people who come from out of town to look at that sculpture and understand who built this city back,” she said. “If we forget that, we forget who we are as New Orleans.”

In the early 1980s, Tennessee State University was at a turning point.
For decades, it had been treated like a second-class university. The state had created the school in the early 1900s as part of the architecture of segregation: The federal government was forcing Tennessee to provide public higher education for Black residents, but the state didn’t want them to attend the University of Tennessee. And even years after the end of the Jim Crow era, poor state funding was the norm.
 ”Everybody that worked at Tennessee State knew Tennessee State was underfunded,” said George Pruitt, a former TSU administrator who worked there in the 1970s. “We didn’t talk about it. We assumed it.”
But in the late 1970s, a judge ordered the University of Tennessee’s Nashville campus to merge into TSU. It was an unprecedented legal remedy for a historically Black university, and one that had the potential to transform this previously marginalized campus. 
TSU would now be the premier public university in Nashville — and afforded the resources, and respect, that came with that status.
“My dad’s vision for Tennessee State was to make it 20,000 students, grow all the professional programs, all the PhD programs, get the best and brightest kids, Black or white, into that institution,” recalls Laurence Humphries. His father, Frederick Humphries, was president of TSU at the time. Humphries wanted to “build Tennessee State into the strongest institution in the state of Tennessee, regardless of makeup,” said Laurence.
It was also important to Humphries that the university continue to prioritize the Black community, as was its founding mission, Laurence said. He envisioned a campus where white students would see a Black president and mostly Black administration.
“ I think he felt like he was going to make this institution a model for how integration is supposed to work,” Laurence said. “I’m going to show you that a Black man can create … a post-Jim Crow, civil rights institution.”
But many people in the state disagreed. 
An ultimatum over racial identity
Within a few years, many white students who came over from UT Nashville had dropped out. Not as many white students were signing up. There was a group of white professors who blamed President Humphries. They said that, because he cared so much about Black identity at TSU, it was leading to resegregation.
The judge in the Geier case, the lawsuit that had led to the TSU merger, expressed dismay. This was not the integrated institution that he’d hoped the merger would produce. And so, in 1984, Judge Thomas Wiseman proposed a settlement that he hoped would lead to “greater progress … toward eliminating the dual system of higher education in Tennessee.”
Within 10 years, he said, TSU should aim for an undergraduate population that was 50% white. The faculty should be 50% white. The administrators should be at least 50% white. These numbers were not quotas, he said, but rather an objective that “encourages effort toward an end.”
The settlement seemed to acknowledge that TSU still wasn’t being properly funded by the state — that the living conditions on campus weren’t good, and the academic programs weren’t competitive enough. It said the state needed to bring TSU’s facilities up to par with other public universities and invest in special programs. 
But the point of such funding, as the judge saw it, was explicitly to recruit white students to come to TSU. In fact, he wrote, the university should shed its Black identity altogether, so as to not alienate prospective white students.
The Debt: Almost 60 years ago, a court case at TSU transformed Tennessee higher education

“No institution will be identified as a one-race institution or a predominantly one-race institution,” he wrote in the settlement. “The heart of the problem is a traditionally black TSU.”
This was not what Humphries envisioned for TSU. But the way his son Laurence describes it, this settlement was an ultimatum.
For years, Humphries had been trying to get the state to care about and invest in its only public HBCU. That was the whole point of fighting for the merger. And this seemed to be the only way that the state would actually follow through.
“The state had put him and the university in a vise grip,” Laurence said. “Knowing my father … it had to be painful, extremely painful. He’s like, ‘I have to get out of here because I’m now violating my integrity.’”
Humphries took a job as president of his alma mater, Florida A&M — another public HBCU. He served in that role for 16 years. He restarted the law school, started a successful scholarship program, and doubled enrollment on campus. At one point, he recruited more National Achievement Scholars than Harvard.
He was so beloved that when he died in 2021, he was called “one of the most transformative people in American higher education.”
But the state of Tennessee, and its public HBCU, took a different path.
A political firestorm
Instead, Tennessee focused on how to get more white students to sign up at TSU, and how to minimize Black culture on campus.
The only problem? The student body and the alumni were still mostly Black. And this very quickly came to a head.
In 1986, Ebony Magazine published its annual HBCU Campus Queens issue. Typically, the college student selected to be Miss Tennessee State University was included in that issue.
But that year, Miss TSU Regina Hampton discovered that she was missing from the feature. Administrators at TSU had decided, without telling her, that the university couldn’t participate because Ebony promoted Black colleges, and TSU couldn’t identify as Black under the terms of the settlement.










 I think he felt like he was going to make this institution a model for how integration is supposed to work. 


– Laurence Humphries of his father, onetime TSU President Frederick Humphries


“That outraged everybody, all over the state of Tennessee,” Pruitt said. “People in Memphis and Chattanooga and Knoxville and Nashville were outraged. The alumni were outraged. And it created a political firestorm.”
So in that way, the settlement didn’t work. It also didn’t work in that every time TSU tried to get more money, it ran into political backlash. 
Four years after the settlement, for example, the governor budgeted $22 million to improve TSU’s buildings because there was asbestos found in the dorms. A state official then accused Black lawmakers of striking “political deals” for the money.
Eventually, the racial objectives were scrapped, as part of a new settlement for the Geier case in the early 2000s. 
To Pruitt, the 1984 settlement missed the point of TSU’s potential.
“ Being a historically Black college was our history, will always be our history, should always be our history. That history should be celebrated and preserved,” he said. 
“If Black students could receive a fair and excellent education at an institution where the president was white, where the faculty was predominantly white, why could not white students get a fair and quality education at a university where the faculty was predominantly Black and the administration was predominantly Black? Tell me why that couldn’t happen.”

The U.S. Senate recently failed to pass competing health care bills, a decision that ensures Affordable Care Act (ACA) premium subsidies will expire at the end of the year and result in skyrocketing insurance costs for millions of Americans.
In Michigan hundreds of thousands ACA enrollees face major premium hikes and potential loss of coverage. Estimates suggest around 200,000 people may need new plans as insurers pull out and over 350,000 enrollees relying on subsidies could face significant cost increases or “uninsurance,” leading to an estimated 200,000 Michiganders becoming uninsured and overall marketplace premiums rising sharply for the state’s 530,000 enrollees.
Further pressure on maintaining record profits for the health care insurance industry suggest premiums will soar for even those not participating in Obamacare/Affordable Care Act.
It is reported that the premium hikes will be:

Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan: Up to 24%(PPO) and 23.2% (BCN)
Priority Health: Around 19.2%
Molina Healthcare: About 18.3%

The American people are fed up with a political system that time and time again fails to protect our most basic needs. This can’t be allowed to continue!
No, I am not chicken little.
I am a participant observer in the American experiment, and like many, see a dysfunctional system steaming full speed ahead while the tracks are being ripped up.
There is a true health care crisis in America and Michigan today. The health care system is on the cusp of an implosion.
From payer to provider the system is driven by profitability and greed. Competition across the nation is narrowing by the day with those in power rushing to get bigger and more profitable (even the so called nonprofit organizations); feed shareholders, CEO’s  and private equity firms; gobble up market share; and acquire more real estate with only a casual concern about the end product of quality care at an affordable cost to the consumer.
Things That Can’t Go On-Won’t
The economic principle known as Stein’s Law, famously stated by economist Herbert Stein, “If something cannot go on forever, it will stop,” will inevitably arrive.
Any trend facing physical, economic, or political limits will eventually hit a wall and cease. The wall is right in front of us and greed makes it invisible to policymakers and many system leaders.
We have passed a point where it’s not about when it stops, but how? Either through thoughtful managed humane reform focused on care and service or disruptive collapse driven by power and greed.
The problems are front and center and known to all: soaring costs (especially for new drugs, post-pandemic demand), provider shortages (staffing, primary care), hospital financial struggles, insurer challenges, and massive public anxiety about affording care, leading many to delay or skip treatment, creating a stressed system with real potential for collapse.
Corrupt System
Be clear, the criticism is meant for an out of control, profit driven, dysfunctional system not the many dedicated nurses, aides, doctors, technicians and support personnel who are the backbone of quality care. These employees did not create the mess; they are simply doing their best to deliver high quality care within the chaotic parameters provided.
We need to stop pretending to fix the holes in our health care system – and actually fix them with quality and care and not profit as the driving metric.
The key issues like rising premiums, affordability and subsidy changes are pressures that are not going away on their own.
It is not a matter of if, but when the system must change or break, with the weak and vulnerable once again being the collateral damage.
The warning signs of a corrupt health care system that has lost focus on care and affordability have been flashing for decades.
The President and Congress need to stop playing deadly games with the American people and provide us with a system of health care that sustains, not bankrupts us.
Michigan’s governor and Legislature should also take a look in the mirror and be held accountable for doing their part as well.
It is change or die time.

(Getty Images)Following all the news can be difficult. 
Important things easily get lost in the shuffle and health care headlines can be especially tough to understand. News reported over the past couple of months in the Idaho Capital Sun offers important insight into Idahoans’ need for health care as the 2026 session looms in Boise. These stories highlighted issues with our state’s approach to applying bureaucratic red tape to Medicaid implementation and offer something of a warning of potential significant problems soon to come. 
Where do people on Idaho Medicaid expansion work? A lot of big companies.

A recent report by the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare showed that major companies and government agencies have many employees who rely on Medicaid expansion for access to health care. The department found that, as less than half of state employers offer benefits as part of compensation, many of the folks who access Medicaid expansion work at major corporations like Amazon and Wal-Mart as well as at the state’s largest universities, like the private Brigham Young University-Idaho in Rexburg and state schools Boise State University and the University of Idaho. BYU-Idaho employees are one of the largest groups accessing insurance coverage through Medicaid expansion, according to the report by the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare.
Another report, this one from the non-partisan Georgetown University Center for Children and Families, found that the number of uninsured children in Idaho increased at the nation’s second-highest rate during the post-pandemic period, when eligibility checks for Medicaid re-started. The number increased from an estimated 28,000 to 40,000. Many of those newly uninsured children were still fully eligible, but lost care through bureaucratic red tape as Idaho tore through the unwinding at one of the nation’s fastest rates, ignoring clearly voiced concerns that the process seemed to value quick purging of the rolls over keeping eligible people covered, just as we are seeing now with the newly adopted monthly work reporting mandates. 
Idaho kids lost health insurance at record rates from 2022 to 2024, report finds

The resulting increase in the uninsured population means more families are now one unplanned medical episode away from significant debt or the need to decide between paying for needed care or a month’s worth of groceries.
The combined message from both stories — and many others of late — must be clearly heard by the state’s leadership: Idaho families rely on Medicaid expansion to stay healthy and working. That also means Idaho’s business infrastructure relies on Medicaid expansion to support the people needed for a healthy workforce. 
The more barriers the state places on Medicaid expansion, or even entertains the idea of eliminating it altogether, the greater the risk to Idaho’s health and economy. There is no backup plan, no safety net waiting to catch those who lose coverage. That’s why it is imperative for the state to proceed more carefully than ever to avoid inflicting additional harm on people who already face significant financial obstacles in the form of mounting inflation. Currently, Medicaid expansion remains one of the most effective and fiscally responsible tools available to keep Idaho families healthy, employed and contributing to a stronger state economy.
They do not need the additional paperwork of monthly work reporting, which is why the state should apply for a good faith waiver to the federal work requirements mandate. The additional year the waiver could grant would give state staffers time to put the plan in place and save Idahoans from at least one year of overwhelming reporting mandates while they are doing all they can to support themselves and their children.
Medicaid expansion currently covers more than 88,000 Idahoans and is critical in rural areas and for our friends and family with serious conditions, like cancer or diabetes. As we learned in the state study, these are our local restaurant and retail workers, public school and university staff and many of our neighbors. These are young parents and professionals trying to get ahead or at least not slip backwards and there are also 20 percent of users living with significant mental illness who are able to get the treatment they need. 
Removing folks from the Medicaid rolls does not save money. It pushes the costs on to providers and leads to increased premiums for everybody. Those without health coverage will be forced to seek out already stressed emergency rooms when their health is at a crisis point.
It is important to note that Medicaid expansion does not provide a check, only access to care. It is a health insurance program, not a source of income. It covers one of every 10 Idahoans diagnosed with cancer, of which our state will see 12,000 new cases this year, a number that won’t decrease by taking care from people who already face increased barriers to accessing recommended screenings and doctor’s visits. 
This is why so many health-focused organizations have opposed cuts to Medicaid in all forms: The evidence and facts show that they simply are bad for people’s health.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)In 2015 I was appointed by Nashville Mayor Karl Dean to the Traffic and Parking Commission and approved by the Nashville Metro Council.  I served for two terms —10 years — under five Nashville Mayors: Dean, Megan Barry, David Briley, John Cooper and Freddie O’Connell. 
Why did I do this? I wanted to serve and believed it would be a way to give back to our city. I have a bachelor’s degree and a master’s degree in city planning, owned a bookstore in growing Hillsboro Village and believed I could contribute.  
According to Metro Nashville’s website  “The purpose of the Traffic and Parking Commission is to make the roads, streets and other public ways safe for pedestrians, motorists and others.” 
I learned quite a bit and developed a wish list for Nashville.  
Traffic in the Nashville area is not going to get any better. We like our cars and most of us are not in support of mass transit (unless you count bridemaids’ beer pedaling, which I don’t). It is aggravating to me that we invest gobsmacking amounts of government dollars in a new football stadium but can’t seem to focus on transit solutions. 
It is mindboggling to me that decades ago we did not bite the bullet and get a state of the art mass system built that works. As a result, drivers need to accept that traffic is not going to get better and plan on congestion adding at least 15 minutes to an hour of sitting in a car during any trips in the Nashville area. 
People die when laws are broken and this grandmother is angry that many drivers believe traffic laws are just suggestions and do not apply to them. Four way stops are stops, not something to run or coast through and they are there to make our streets and neighborhoods safer. I advise drivers to count to two before hitting the gas when a traffic light changes from red to green. You can count on a car flying through the red light or deciding to block other cars instead of coming to a complete stop.
There is a scene in the movie “The Exorcist,” of the possessed Linda Blair turning her head 360 degrees. That is what our pedestrians must do anytime they step onto city streets. I experience this because I walk outside almost daily for exercise. Wear bright clothing, carry lights if you must walk when it is not a sunny day and as much as you want to respond to drivers who give you nasty looks when they have to come to a stop, ignore them. 
Sidewalks are a good thing but not everyone has one in front of their home. If I could wave a magic wand, building sidewalks would be a higher priority than installing more bicycle lanes.
We do not have enough police to enforce traffic laws in Nashville so we need to invest in the technology that will enable our government to fine people who break traffic laws. I am in favor of installing some type of “red light cameras,” that record those who ignore traffic lights, four-way stops and pedestrian walkways. 
Installing speed cushions before walkways and four-way stops will get the attention of drivers. I know speed bumps, humps and cushions are unpopular,, but they slow drivers down and discourage people from using neighborhood streets as racetracks when they practice their NASCAR tryout routines.
Trucks and cars park haphazardly on Nashville streets all hours of the day and cause traffic problems. There has got to be a safer way to make deliveries, build houses with construction crews, mow yards and landscape and bring in big trucks and crews to decorate houses for the holidays. 
Is there a reason these motorized roadblockers cannot pull into the driveway where they are working, building or making a delivery? You cannot see around these vehicles to know if there is oncoming traffic when they are parked like they own the roads. 
If a home is being built, why can’t the city require workers to park on the property instead of blocking the street?  Someone ran into my car because they could not see around the trucks parked by the construction workers.  We were told they did not want to get mud on their truck which would happen if they parked on the construction site. 
Good grief, is their clean truck more important than the safety of those around them? 
Recently I observed several big trucks blocking one lane of traffic on a busy street for several hours to put up holiday lights on someone’s property. The residence has a big driveway that could have easily accommodated the workers and all of their equipment and Santa and eight reindeer. Santa gets a pass.Trucks should not. 
What are we doing to protect pedestrians and other drivers from Waymo self-driving cars and what is the deal with Waymo not being programmed to stop for school buses? The Traffic and Parking Commission votes on contracts to outsource the management of some city properties and functions.  I think the response to customers and taxpayers is better coming directly from Metro than waiting for a response from a private parking garage vendor whose only goal is a profit not solving problems.
Serving on this commission was a meaningful experience and I came away with respect for most of our government employees.  I left as Vice Chair and declined to serve another term.  My advice is if you want to make a change in your neighborhood, start with your council representative and watch or attend the Commission meetings.

(Photo by Perry Bennett/West Virginia Legislative Photography)Oxford Dictionary chose rage bait as its 2025 Word of the Year due to its surging usage and reflection of modern online tactics. As a linguist, my first reaction was that rage bait is two words. Oxford explained that their yearly word choice can be a singular word or expression. Justification, which so often runs rampant throughout the land, seems to serve as a catch all for far too much, whether rearing its ugly head in politics or on the domestic front or quite often with finances. And as I discussed this justification recently with a friend, my fury heightened, to which he responded, “See, it worked,” and I couldn’t argue the obvious, because he did in fact prove its point. I admit that I was disappointed in Oxford’s choice, having hoped that the Word of the Year for 2025 would be capitulation.
Merriam-Webster showed that rage bait can also be hyphenated, as a single word, and as two words. And the degree of justification climbs. In its most elementary terms, rage bait is content (most often online) that tries to provoke anger or outrage, as a means of gaining attention or making money; the latter bringing to mind the steady stream of coins dropping into a tray from a Las Vegas slot machine: “ding, ding, ding, ding” ringing loud and clear.
Most rage bait refers to inflammatory content posted online to gain ad revenue. It also represents posting something offensive simply to elicit a strong reaction. Have we really sunk to that level? Unfortunately, it appears so.
Conversely, capitulation is defined as the action of surrendering or ceasing to resist an opponent or demand. The evident dangers of both rage bait and capitulation are so obvious and yet, after three days of voting and discussions that included 30,000 people, rage bait won. This result led me to wonder whether we are supporting, encouraging even, an ignorant populace. As a former educator, are we “dumbing down?” I can only urge Americans to educate themselves, to not let ignorance win.
In looking back over 2025, since Gov. Patrick Morrisey was elected to lead West Virginia and its people forward to the benefit of all rather than a few, were his decisions led by his own political aspirations and not to the betterment of West Virginia and its residents? Did he provoke anger, frustration in the aim to promote progress or to gain political favor that would catapult him to an even higher office? Did he simply follow a leader whose intentions have become the order of the day? Let’s take a look at the incredulity of what West Virginia and its people confronted in 2025:

Deployment of West Virginia’s National Guard to DC
School vaccine mandates
SNAP benefits
Health care benefits
PEIA
Coal regulations (or lack of)
WV jails’ infractions
ICE raids
Education enrollment decline
Clean water accessibility
DEI bans
Senior care and Medicare
LGBTQ+ visibility and protection
Data centers’ looming concerns
Foster care crisis

The answer to the titled question that began this commentary should be crystal clear. I believe that each of us is smart enough to see, with stark clarity, who has his ear, who he so willingly follows.

Advocates, including a student group and the American Cancer Society, have previously urged the General Assembly to move those funds into the Tobacco Prevention and Cessation Program.

The payments are currently going to the state’s general fund. 
Shannon Moody, Kentucky Youth Advocates’ chief officer of strategic initiatives, is optimistic that the JUUL funds will get moved next session since it’s a budget year: “It’s very likely that this year it will get filed and will be successful,” she said. 
Some other legislative priorities in the blueprint include: 
Foster care IDs 
All children in foster care would automatically receive identification cards under this KYA priority, which Moody said would be a “really small budget ask” at “thousands of dollars, not … millions.” 
“We know that youth who are transitioning out of foster care struggle to get access to jobs and housing if they don’t have the proper documentation,” Moody said. “They cannot often access an ID because they don’t have the other supportive documents needed to get an ID, whether it’s a driver’s license or state issued ID.” 
Another concern, Moody said, is the increased risk foster youth face of being trafficked. In 2023, about 67% of the 199 cases that the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children handled in Kentucky involved children missing from social services facilities, according to KYA, which is now asking the legislature to require the Cabinet for Health and Family Services to automatically issue IDs to foster youth, at no cost to the children. 
Utility disconnections in extreme weather 
KYA wants the legislature to block utility disconnections during extreme weather events. 
According to the organization, utility disconnections mostly hurt families with young children, low-income households, households of color, households with an individual who relies on electronic medical devices and individuals living in poor conditions.
If Kentucky set a disconnection policy in 2026, it would join 42 others to do so, according to the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). 
Abusers in schools  
In 2025, Rep. James Tipton, R-Taylorsville, filed an unsuccessful bill that would have prohibited schools from entering into nondisclosure agreements with a person who behaved inappropriately toward a child and create mechanisms to keep abusers from jumping to another school. 
Kentucky Youth Advocates is pushing for the bill to become law in 2026 and expects to see it filed again. 
“What we see, unfortunately, is … a lot of students are in positions where a small handful of educators or other school employees are grooming them or looking for ways to develop some sort of inappropriate relationship,” Moody said. 
This policy change, she said, would create a mechanism to ensure that if there is an investigation of a school employee around sexual misconduct with a student, that investigation starts and ends and is not interrupted, even if the person resigns.” The bill in 2025 also required schools to share information about substantiated misconduct. 
“It’s really to avoid what people are calling on a national level ‘pass the trash’ — when teachers or other school employees will go from school to school having violated or perpetrated on students. And oftentimes, what we see with sexual misconduct is it’s not just one student, it’s multiple students,” Moody explained. 
More than 70% of child sexual abuse victims do not disclose that abuse occurred within five years of the experience, and 61% of the cases in which Kentucky teachers who lost their licenses between 2016 and 2021 were due to sexual misconduct. 
Other policies 
Even though it’s not outlined as a 2026 priority for Kentucky Youth Advocates, Moody said changes to safety net programs, especially those that will impact kids, need a serious legislative look. For example, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act changed work reporting requirements to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) program, which removed a previous exemption for foster youth and others.
“I hope that our legislators are going to look at some of the issues that are coming down from the federal level,” Moody said. “We’re thinking defensively about what the SNAP program looks like, what the community eligibility program looks like … and then some of the impacts of Medicaid changes.”

(Photo by Greg Childress/NC Newsline)Running a food bank is incredibly challenging work – financially, physically, emotionally – during even the best of times. And that’s because food banks are engaged in what is essentially impossible work.
Even when they’re operating at peak efficiency – and most do work miracles on shoestring budgets – food banks can only address a small fraction of the hunger problem that plagues our country. Like tiny sponges trying to soak up a river of need, food banks do remarkable and important work for thousands upon thousands of people, but in the end, there is only so much they can do with the limited resources they have.
And things have gotten much worse of late, just in time for the holidays.
Ron Pringle confronts this sobering reality every day. Pringle, a former Air Force chaplain, is the President and CEO of the Raleigh-based Interfaith Food Shuttle. And as he made clear in a recent interview, this past year has been the toughest he’s experienced during more than two decades of a career spent helping people in need.
“I’m in conversations with food banks all over the country. And, you know, in my 25-plus years, I haven’t seen a year like this,” Pringle said.

The reason is simple: the confluence of soaring prices for basic goods – the national “affordability crisis” – and big cuts to public food assistance.
Thanks to our nation’s crazy, upside-down economy and threadbare safety net, tens of millions of Americans are “food insecure.”
In North Carolina, 1.4 million people – that’s about one-in-eight – relied on federal SNAP food assistance benefits in 2024. Of that number, more than 66% were in families with children and more than 34% were in families with members who are older adults or are disabled.
Indeed, it’s an amazing and scandalous fact that 25% of children in our state live in food-insecure homes.
Unfortunately, as you’ve no doubt heard, SNAP benefits and aid to anti-hunger nonprofits like food banks have been on the Republican policy chopping block in Washington and Raleigh.
Topping the list of damaging cuts were those enacted as part of President Trump’s so-called “one big, beautiful bill” this past summer. The nonpartisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities reports that the cuts in the bill – the largest in U.S. history to food aid – will reduce SNAP funding by $187 billion (about 20%) through 2034. The Center estimates that, as a result, “about 4 million people, including children, seniors, veterans, and individuals with disabilities, will see the food assistance they need to afford groceries terminated or cut substantially.”
And then there are the new work requirements that just took effect and that now require SNAP recipients aged 18 to 64 to work or volunteer at least 80 hours per month, be in a training program, or earn at least $217.50 per week to continue receiving benefits for more than three months in a three-year period.
It’s the last thing someone living on the very edge needs: to be treated like a parolee having to document one’s life in a confusing bureaucratic process every month. States that tried such an approach previously spent as much (or more) on the expanded monitoring bureaucracy as they saved in reduced benefits.
But, of course, it’s not just the direct assistance people receive – the average for North Carolina households in 2022 was the princely sum of $287 per month – that will be slashed; funding that flows to nonprofits (like food banks) is also being cut at the federal and state levels. As Pringle observed, “For the first time in decades, the food banks in North Carolina are not in the state budget.”
The result: forced cuts to innovative and essential programs like the Food Shuttle’s “BackPack Buddies” program that provides healthy weekend meals for children and accessible pantries for their families. And so it is that Pringle now faces impossible chores like having to decide things like which elementary and middle schools will no longer have an on-site pantry for students in need.
Of course, all of this would be one thing if we lived in a time like the Great Depression in which even the upper middle class and well-off were suffering, but that is decidedly not the case – especially for the super-rich.
According to the most recent Forbes magazine report, the 400 richest people in the United States in 2025 are worth $6.6 trillion. Amazingly, their combined wealth increased by $1.2 trillion during just the most recent year.
Think about that for a second. Merely by capturing the one-year wealth increase of 400 individuals, the United States could fund the entire national SNAP budget that benefits more than 40 million people for the next 10 years.
The bottom line: As Christmas 2025 arrives, the politicians in the Trumpified GOP and their oligarch masters are doing their best impression of Dickens’ Ebeneezer Scrooge when it comes to the wellbeing of their fellow Americans. One wishes that a terrifying ghost or two would invade their upcoming holiday dreams to help restore some basic human decency.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Image-4-2048x1536-1-1024x768.png,,,2025-12-16 05:56:25.664798

(Photo by Charles Paullin/Inside Climate News)This past summer, a fire at an electrical substation forced data centers in Loudoun County to rely on backup diesel generators as their power source.
Grid failures like this happen often, but this time, shoppers in a nearby Walmart parking lot heard the noisy generators start up and reported smelling diesel fumes.
“People were like, ‘What is going on?’” said Julie Bolthouse, the director of land use for the Piedmont Environmental Council, an environmental nonprofit fighting data center sprawl. “This sounds like planes landing constantly for over 24 hours.”
Loudoun County Supervisor Mike Turner, who represents the Ashburn region known as “Data Center Alley” because it is home to the world’s largest concentration of the facilities, said email complaints flooded his inbox during the incident.
“Frankly, they’re filthy,” Turner said of the diesel generators that had to run for four or five days. “As soon as they start running their backup generators, we start getting complaints.”
Now, new guidance from the state’s Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) may expand the circumstances under which data centers could use their backup diesel generators next year, raising concerns among residents and environmentalists about air and noise pollution.
“Any increase in how often they’re running is going to cause corresponding localized air pollution,” said Tyler Demetriou, an associate attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center.
The DEQ guidance surfaced in a Sept. 30 memo from Mike Dowd, director of the Air and Renewable Energy Division, to Director Michael Rolband. It expands the definition of an emergency, allowing for the use of the diesel generators, known as Tier II generators.
Data center growth drives locals to fight for more say

Currently, Virginia’s regulations allow Tier II generators to operate only in emergencies, generally defined as “sudden and reasonably unforeseeable” events, including power outages or natural disasters. Cleaner-burning generators, known as Tier IV generators, can run outside of emergencies, but their emission-control technology is more costly.
The new guidance would add a “planned outage” scheduled by a utility to the list of emergencies  when dirtier, cheaper Tier II generators could run. DEQ uses a scenario in which notice of an outage is provided within 14 days or less.
“In light of this analysis, DEQ considers that an electric outage may sometimes be a ‘sudden and reasonably unforeseeable’ event, even if the electricity service provider has ‘scheduled’ or “planned” the outage and given notice to a source in advance,” Dowd wrote in his memo to Rolband.
Dominion Energy, Virginia’s largest utility, did not respond to requests for comment on the DEQ guidance.
But the Data Center Coalition, an industry group representing data center developers and many of the world’s wealthiest big-tech corporations, supports the new definition, given data centers’ need for guaranteed, continuous power.
Despite its support, the coalition deferred questions about the guidance to DEQ, which told Inside Climate News that interested parties had requested the guidance.
“DEQ is unable to speculate on the timing or duration of potential future outages,” a DEQ spokesperson said. “However, each data center will need to comply with their permitted emission limits.”
There are about 9,000 generators in Virginia, with about 4,700 in Loudoun County. Of the total,  around 8,000 are Tier II, Bolthouse said. A recent report from Virginia’s legislative research arm noted that data center operators want to use backup generators for days-long outages. “But in practice, the generators are rarely run for prolonged periods,” the report said. “Most [data center] operators reported experiencing zero to two minor outages per site in the last two years, with nearly all outages being between one and five hours long.”
Currently, Tier II generators have limits on how many hours they can run and the amount of  pollutants they can emit. From a local health perspective, diesel generators produce many harmful pollutants, including those that contribute to ground‑level ozone formation and particulate matter.
Among those substances: air pollutants such as particulate matter (PM2.5), nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide and ozone precursors; toxic air contaminants, such as black carbon, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, benzene, formaldehyde and aldehydes, and the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide (CO₂) and methane.
These pollutants have been associated with cardiopulmonary death, hospitalizations for cardiovascular and respiratory disease and emergency room visits for asthma, among other health effects.
The Virginia legislative research report determined that, in a worst-case scenario, data centers’ backup generators could release 9,000 tons of nitrogen oxides in the region. “That is equal to about half of what has typically been emitted annually in Northern Virginia by all sources,” the report said.
One factor driving the desire for greater flexibility in diesel generator use in Virginia is the state’s need for upgrades to grid transmission lines, over 100 of which are planned to deliver more power to energy-guzzling data centers. These upgrades involve cutting existing lines before adding new ones, which often necessitates temporary outages for grid users.
Waiting for transmission upgrades prompted an earlier attempt by DEQ in 2023 to grant a broader variance from emission controls for diesel generators. Patrick Fanning, Virginia staff attorney with the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, sees this guidance memo as another attempt.
“I think the whole concept is that you plan ahead for the outage, not treat it as an emergency,” said Fanning. “I don’t see it as beneficial to the public or Dominion (Energy), more so as beneficial to the data centers themselves, so that they can ensure no power interruption, which seems to be sort of like their golden standard—never having a power disruption.”
Questions about exactly when diesel generators could be used, and pollution concerns, point to flaws in DEQ’s efforts to “shoehorn these planned outages into its existing definition of an emergency, where they don’t really fit,” SELC’s Demetriou said. “If it wants to expand that definition to cover this sort of thing, it has the regulatory power to do that, but it needs to go through the full notice and comment rulemaking process to amend the regulation.”
The Northern Virginia area just east of Loudoun remains under an ozone “non-attainment” designation for failing to meet air quality standards due to heavy car use in the region. DEQ’s Dowd and local government officials recently celebrated findings showing attainment has been achieved, but a formal plan to maintain attainment needs to be devised by the agency and approved by the EPA before the designation is lifted.
The increased use of diesel generators may have an impact, particularly on hot days when air quality worsens, said Jeff King, director of climate, energy, and air programs with the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments. But it’s not clear if it would affect attainment measures, he said.
“Without having all the emissions data, and all the understanding of how much are we really talking about, it’s hard to know for sure,” said King.
But recent reports indicate that  ratepayer savings could be realized by avoiding grid investments if data centers use less grid energy, which worries Bolthouse, of the Piedmont Environmental Council. Bolthouse is concerned that onsite generator use will happen more often. Data center developers are now often trying to “bring their own power capacity” to be plugged into the grid faster, without disruption or delay.
At the same time, the U.S. Department of Energy under President Donald Trump wants to eliminate emissions controls to enable faster data centers connectivity. The Trump administration’s Speed to Power Initiative, a related effort, includes 17.6 gigawatts of planned data center capacity across five Virginia counties.
“Of course, the Trump administration is trying to dismantle the Clean Air Act,” Bolthouse said, raising the possibility that Trump might in the future favor diesel generator use more broadly, beyond emergencies.
Battery storage systems are available to help power data centers during grid outages, the Sierra Club pointed out in comments submitted to DEQ. But Bolthouse noted those systems take up land space. Turner, the Loudoun County supervisor, noted that traditional battery systems provide power for only  four hours before they need to be recharged.
“I am not that surprised,” Turner said of DEQ’s guidance memo. “All these forces are operating right now simultaneously. We have a constrained grid in Loudoun County. It makes perfect sense for DEQ to widen the aperture of what constitutes an emergency, to allow the data centers to use the backup generators … I don’t know if I agree with it.”
All this has led environmental groups to request a 30-day extension to comment on the guidance. Under Virginia rules, DEQ must grant it, which would mean the change would still be under review when governor-elect Abigail Spanberger, a moderate Democrat, takes office in January.
Where she will come down on diesel generators isn’t clear. For now, a Spanberger spokesperson declined to comment.

(Photo by Klaus Vedfelt/Getty Images) Virginia’s recently published enrollment data indicates that state schools will need about $1.2 billion over the next two years, more than was projected just weeks ago amid challenges in funding other key areas.  
Enrollment data is the main factor in calculating Standards of Quality costs — the formula that determines how much state and localities must contribute — to ensure a high-quality education. The review process of school-related costs is conducted every two years.
The House and Senate estimated the baseline cost to cover schools was at least $844 million, about $356 million more compared to projections presented by the Virginia Department of Education at a work session last Wednesday.
Levi Goren, director of research and education policy with the Commonwealth Institute for Fiscal Analysis, said some of the bright spots potentially favoring K-12’s budget is Virginia’s “strong” economy, as reported by the governor’s office, and increased public interest in raising new revenue.
“We know that the current pie is not enough to meet the needs of our communities in the way that our families deserve, so we need to figure out how we can grow that pie and there’s a lot of interesting ideas out there in the tax base for doing that,” said Goren.
The institute co-leads a statewide coalition called Fund Our Schools, pushing for “fully and fairly” funding public education in the commonwealth.
While enrollment is projected to decline, presumably lowering overall funding needs, the education agency said the cost to fund Virginia’s schools is driven by several factors. The money will include 6% teacher pay raises legislators approved last year and a larger number of students being identified as needing extra support. Operating expenses including materials, supplies, and training account for 42% of the biennial rebenchmarking costs. Another factor is inflation.
Lawmakers also expect federal funds totaling $45 million to offset costs.
The agency also considered other updates, including the revised local composite index — which determines what each locality can pay for its respective school — revised sales tax projections, and revised Virginia Retirement System fringe benefit rates.
“I think, just understanding that rebenchmarking is the cost to maintain the status quo, … (it’s) not actually good enough for a lot of our students,” Goren said. “We need to also be having a conversation about the investments we can make to improve educational quality in parts of the commonwealth that don’t have the resources to do it on their own.”
VDOE said it was delayed in providing the reports to the state lawmakers because it had not received the daily student attendance from all 132 school divisions, which were due by Sept. 30. 
Christina Berta, VDOE chief operations officer, said three school divisions — in Essex and Northumberland counties and the city of Norton — have not yet submitted their fiscal year 2025 annual school reports to the agency, which are “critical for the department’s work in providing complete information for policy and decision makers.” 
However, she said the three missing reports do not have a direct impact on the agency’s benchmarking report. Berta said the agency is working with the schools to get their information included for lawmakers. 
Gov. Glenn Youngkin will be considering the data ahead of presenting his proposed budget on Wednesday to the House and Senate money committees. 
The board did not take any action on the item at its work session. Members will have another review of fall membership information at its Jan. 8 meeting before the start of the General Assembly session, beginning Jan. 14.

(Photo by Getty Images)Across Virginia, housing costs are rising faster than paychecks. Too many residents face impossible choices between rent and groceries or between staying rooted in their communities and finding somewhere they can afford to live. 
In the past decade, units renting for under $1,000 a month (inflation-adjusted) fell by more than 32% in Virginia, and the current average rent ranges from $1,800 to $2,000 a month.
The average home price has jumped nearly 50%, putting homeownership out of reach for many working families. In Richmond, fewer than one in four Black households own their home, a rate that has barely changed in more than half a century. 
Meanwhile, localities continue to lose mature trees and green space, especially in low-income and historically redlined communities, to make room for more housing – which is often unattainable. In Southside Richmond neighborhoods like Blackwell and Oak Grove, tree canopy has dropped below 20%, leaving streets up to 15 degrees hotter and experiencing more urban flooding than leafier parts of town.
Study shows historically redlined Virginia neighborhoods are hotter in the summer

Too often, conversations about solutions pit housing against the environment, as if building affordable homes means cutting down the trees that make our neighborhoods livable. That’s a false choice. Virginia can and must do both: grow an affordable housing market while protecting the natural infrastructure that keeps communities healthy and resilient.
The maples, oaks, pines, and birch trees in our yards, streets, and parks offer valuable public health and functional benefits, even at an early stage of growth. As trees mature, they do more for us – filtering more air pollutants, lowering energy bills, cooling streets, and even capturing 500 to 600 gallons of stormwater annually.
To tackle this shared challenge, Southside ReLeaf partnered with our friends at the Chesapeake Bay Foundation and convened more than two dozen housing providers and experts, environmental justice advocates, urban planners, and Virginia state legislators serving the Hampton Roads region for Growing Together: From Roots to Roofs, a two-day summit focused on answering: “How can Virginia build the affordable homes people need without sacrificing the trees and green spaces that make communities resilient?”
Participants emerged from the summit with a shared vision: “Every Virginian should live in a home that is affordable, safe, and surrounded by healthy green spaces that protect against heat, flooding, and pollution.”
To advance this vision, attendees identified key challenges and opportunities to address to guide Virginia’s next steps:

Remove barriers to equitable and resilient development. Structural, political and procedural barriers that limit equitable growth include: political fear and resident opposition, communication barriers, outdated zoning, and the exclusion of those facing housing insecurity or living in heat-vulnerable neighborhoods in planning processes. 
Reframe development to be community-centered. Residents must shape and drive the design and development process from the beginning through multilingual and accessible engagement. Plans should prioritize local priorities such as tree canopy and walkability, and grassroots groups can bridge the gap between technical planning and lived experiences.
Foster stronger collaboration across sectors. Affordable housing advocates, green space champions, builders, and policymakers must move beyond their silos and build shared goals and shared language. Broader coalitions unlock solutions necessary for progress to become possible.
Redefine profitability and success. Resilient communities aren’t just measured on financial return — they’re places where people are healthy, stable, and connected to nature. Success should include well-being, sustainability and long-term community investment.

Out of those discussions, the Roots to Roofs summit produced six key policy recommendations. Among them:

Give every locality the authority to protect and replace its tree canopy, which is currently granted only to Northern Virginia jurisdictions.
Encourage redevelopment of impervious and vacant sites by expanding tax credits and scoring advantages for Low-Income Housing Tax Credit projects, prioritizing underused commercial areas, empty storefronts and large parking lots rather than clearing forested land.
Create a statewide “pattern book” of sustainable housing designs that integrates pre-approved, climate-smart plans that localities can use to streamline by-right development and construction speed. 

These recommendations, outlined in our Roots to Roofs 2025 Summit Report, are only the beginning of the collaborative work required across the commonwealth. But they share a common purpose: Ensuring every Virginian can find and afford a home while communities grow without sacrificing the natural systems that protect them.
Achieving that vision requires political will — from both state legislators and local governments — to expand local authority, fund community-driven planning and secure new development that strengthens both our affordable housing stock and our natural resilience. 
Virginia’s future depends on how we build today. If we choose growth that keeps people and trees rooted in the same soil, we can ensure every community has both the homes and the canopy it needs to thrive.

(Photo by Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)All year, the residents of the Loudoun Valley Estates neighborhoods in Ashburn have been railing against a proposed high-voltage power line that could run through their community to energize dozens of data centers on the other side of town. On Monday, they spelled out their concerns to state regulators in Richmond.
Dominion Energy said the project is a critical piece of energy infrastructure necessary to power the energy-hungry data centers. The case has been framed as a major test of how rising data center power needs can impact developed areas as the industry continues to grow.
The public testimony portion of the State Corporation Commission hearing began Monday, with over 1000 written statements submitted and more than 500 people registered to speak. The evidentiary portion of the hearing is expected to be scheduled in the new year and a final decision about the power line will be made after that. 
The case
Golden to Mars
The transmission line will connect two substations named Golden and Mars. It is part of the so-called reliability loop of power to bring more energy to data centers on the eastern side of Ashburn. Two other lines in the loop have already been approved and are either already under construction or will be soon. 
The 165 foot, 500 kilovolt lines require a wide berth from trees and community members have expressed concerns about the lines’ potential health effects on those living below them.
There are five proposed routes for the power lines that snake around the two Loudoun Valley Estates communities. Dominion has stated previously that route 3 is their top choice. However, that path runs along the properties of Rock Ridge High School and Rosa Lee Carter Elementary School. The Loudoun County School Board voted against routes 3 and 4 – recommending that the power lines be buried if those routes were to be considered.
Following that vote, route 3a was created, which moved the power lines up the hill behind the high school. But that brought the lines right into the backyard of multiple households and has sparked widespread public pushback. The county has also spoken against route 1 that would run along Loudoun County Parkway, stating it would not align with the county’s plan for the look of the area.
Dominion said the Golden-Mars line is the final piece of the puzzle in the reliability loop. If it is not powered on by 2028, the utility said, there could be damage to existing infrastructure and potential fines brought down by the regional grid operator PJM.
Community opposition
All of the proposed routes butt up against residential neighborhoods. The 3a route has drawn significant concern for Vicky Hu, a resident of Loudoun Valley Estates whose backyard would be the location of one of the 165 foot tall power poles if that route is chosen. She said she lives in fear of her home losing significant value and of the potential impacts on her and her neighbors’ quality of life should a power line of that magnitude tower over her home.
“So why should we accept the high voltage power line? It doesn’t give power to our house, right?” Hu said. “I just don’t understand. How can they even propose this power line that cuts through the neighborhood?”
The debate over this project has drawn the attention of state lawmakers and U.S. Rep. Suhas Subramanyam, D-Loudoun, who have spoken out against the impacts these power lines could have on the surrounding residents. The Loudoun County Board of Supervisors shared their support of burying portions of the powerlines that come within 500 feet of residential areas and schools.
“While Loudoun County has no role in determining whether transmission lines are above or below ground, we do have a voice,” Chairman At-Large Phyllis J. Randall said in a statement.  “An alternative is possible and must be considered to assure any impact on our schools and residential communities is mitigated to the extent possible.”
Dominion conducted a feasibility study into the potential burial of the lines. They found that there is not enough space for the location of the entry points into the ground and there are challenges with water usage and other issues. Currently, Virginia does not have lines of this voltage buried. But Loudoun County engineer Brian Conroy believes it can be done and argues the potential in his testimony filed with the SCC.
Before authorities make a final call, Hu and other neighbors are drawing attention to what they say is an unfair and unhealthy plan.
“This is an environmental injustice, because you got this big corporation coming in saying we want to go through your backyard,” Hu said.
Once public testimony wraps up, the parties in the case will set a date for a hearing to present their opening arguments.

(Photo by Shalina Chatlani/Stateline)NEW YORK — On a frigid December morning along busy Broadway in the Astoria neighborhood of Queens, New York, pedestrians walk rapidly toward the subway. Cars and e-bikes speed along a busy two-lane road and blast through sharp turns during the early rush to get to the office.
In recent years on this stretch of Broadway, cars have struck and killed pedestrians, crashed into businesses, and collided with parking meters, ripping them out of the ground.
For nearly 50 years, John Arvanitis has owned the Omonia Café on Broadway. He said he doesn’t see much enforcement of traffic laws.
“They have a sign that says ‘25,’ but sometimes people go fast. They’ll go past the light,” said Arvanitis, 70. He added that motorcycles and bikes speed down the street too.

One of his diners, 58-year-old Gail Grigaux, chimed in to say that she often sees vehicles buzzing through red lights — and even barreling down the sidewalk.
“There’s all these mopeds and e-bikes that are really dangerous. Just walking on the street and all of a sudden they zoom right by you,” Grigaux said. “It’s really frightening because I’m helping my elderly mother, and she can’t respond that quickly to get out of the way.”
Between 2013 and 2022, the number of traffic-related deaths in the United States increased by nearly 23%, from 32,893 to 42,514, according to a March report by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Pedestrian deaths increased by 50% during the same period, the most recent for which numbers are available.
The CDC noted that the U.S. fared poorly compared with 27 other high-income countries, where all road-related deaths decreased by a median of more than 19% and pedestrian fatalities declined by a median of nearly 25%.
State legislators have noticed.
This year, Virginia and Washington enacted laws requiring the installation of speed limiting devices in the vehicles of drivers with multiple speeding or reckless driving violations. New Hampshire and Wisconsin are considering similar legislation to stop so-called super speeders.
So is New York. Democratic state Sen. Andrew Gounardes, the sponsor of New York’s bill, said in an interview that the state has increasingly used automated enforcement tools such as speed cameras in school zones and red-light cameras, but that “it became clear that there was a stubborn subset of drivers who continued to pose a problem because of their repeat recidivism and recklessness.”
Gounardes’ bill would require the installation of a speed limiting device if a driver accumulates 11 or more points on their driving record during a two-year period, or receives six or more speed camera or red-light camera tickets in a year.

This year’s legislation in New York and other states comes after a flurry of activity last year, when nine states (Alabama, California, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Utah, plus Washington, D.C.) enacted 19 measures to curb aggressive or reckless driving, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, a bipartisan policy research group.
In New York, the state Senate approved Gounardes’ bill in June and sent it to the Assembly, where it is stuck in committee. He said that while nobody in either party supports dangerous driving, it can be difficult to push through legislation to curb it. He said some of his colleagues seem to believe that “drivers are entitled to special treatment and that any efforts to hold drivers accountable impinges upon that God-given American right to be free behind the wheel.”
Nevertheless, he said he is confident that the legislation eventually will become law.
But Dawn Riendeau, who lives in Queens, knows how difficult it can be to get New York lawmakers to place any limits on drivers. In 2008, her 14-year-old daughter, Angelica Nappi, was killed when a driver with several license suspensions ran a red light and struck the vehicle she was in. For 16 years, Riendeau urged state legislators to approve a law to keep high-risk drivers with multiple license suspensions off the road. It finally went into effect last year.
“I was back and forth with Albany, many of the assemblymen and the senators — they didn’t like the way the law was worded. They thought it was too harsh,” Riendeau told Stateline. “It’s just a stepping stone, and there’s definitely much more work that has to be done in order to make our roadway safer, and legislation more punitive.
“Driving is a privilege, and when you get behind the wheel of a car, you have to be very conscious of the decisions that you make,” Riendeau added. “You really can cause a lot of lifetime damage to people.”
Officers pulling back
Jessica Cicchino, senior vice president of research at the nonprofit Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, said dangerous driving worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic, when roads emptied and people were under tremendous stress.
Dark highways, fast cars, few sidewalks — and more pedestrian deaths

“We saw a lot of changes in risky behavior nationwide, more broadly, during the pandemic,” Cicchino said. “We saw people behaving in risky ways, even outside of their cars.”
But Cicchino noted that traffic enforcement also declined during the pandemic, as officers were encouraged to social distance and to limit unnecessary interactions with residents.
Even before the pandemic, there was rising pressure on police to scale back traffic enforcement. Critics said police disproportionately pulled over Black and Hispanic drivers, and noted that many instances of police misconduct took place during traffic stops. Many officers, increasingly wary of being accused of abuse or racism — or being involved in deadly encounters — were happy to pull back.
As a result, the number of traffic stops and citations issued declined precipitously, according to a July report by The New York Times. In some places, the newspaper reported, traffic enforcement still hadn’t returned to pre-pandemic levels by 2023.
In New York City, for example, the number of traffic citations issued in 2023 was still 37% lower than in 2018. Between 2019 and 2022, the number of traffic-related deaths in New York rose by 11%.
In other cities where the number of traffic stops or traffic citations lagged post-pandemic, there was an even greater spike in traffic-related deaths: In Memphis, Tennessee, deaths increased by 74%, in Philadelphia they increased by 58%, and in Seattle they were up 39%.
Scott Hall is the owner of the comedy club Grove 34 in Astoria, where he also lives. He said that in his neighborhood, “It’s literally organized street racing all night. They do doughnuts in the intersections.”
“Anything past 11 o’clock at night is very dangerous to be walking around,” said Hall, 34. He said he believes that if the police were present, “it just wouldn’t happen.”

Another Astoria resident, 39-year-old Jill Wurzburg, started an online petition calling on the local police to step up traffic enforcement after a woman in her neighborhood mothers’ group was nearly hit by a car in June while walking with her toddler. A stroller was mangled in the incident but nobody was harmed. The petition has garnered more than 660 signatures so far.
“In the last five years, enforcement of traffic violations has dropped. Ignoring moving violations gives tacit permission to drivers to continue bad behavior, and every parent has noticed how reckless and aggressive drivers in our neighborhood have become,” the petition says.
“As long as there are no consequences for driving recklessly, drivers will continue to do it.”
The petition notes that a 7-year-old girl was struck and killed by a car in 2023. As the mother of a small child, Wurzburg said she feels unsafe walking around the neighborhood.
“There’s just this culture in Astoria, it seems, of prioritizing drivers over everybody else. And I’m someone who drives to work every day,” she said. “I think that the driving culture here is very dangerous to pedestrians, cyclists and drivers.”
The power of technology
But it’s difficult to establish a direct causal relationship between traffic enforcement and traffic deaths — in some cases, aggressive traffic enforcement can increase the danger by precipitating high-speed chases. In New York City, for example, police-involved car crashes spiked last year.
Some advocates see the greater use of technology, such as speed limiters, as a powerful solution.
Illegal street takeovers — with stunts and noise — are growing as states try to crack down

Cathy Chase, president of Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, a group that lobbies for laws to create safer roads, said the group wants to see more state laws mandating speed assistance technology. She said the group also wants more use of speeding and red-light cameras.
“If people know that they might get a ticket for running a red light or speeding, they’re less likely to engage in that behavior,” Chase told Stateline. “These automated enforcement systems should be in use in all localities where aggressive and reckless driving is an issue.”
In Washington, state Rep. Mari Leavitt, who sponsored the speed limiter bill signed into law this year, said the measure passed quickly with broad bipartisan support — notable because new traffic safety laws are often contentious. The new law mandates the installation of speed detection technology in the vehicles of repeat offenders or under a judge’s order.
“People are dying. In Washington state the top two reasons people die on the roads is because of DUIs and excessive speeding,” said Leavitt, a Democrat. “This is a really effective tool that is new and innovative that will save lives.”
Other jurisdictions, including Queens, believe that engineering changes can make a huge difference.
In November 2024, the New York City Department of Transportation touted the completion of a nine-year-project to improve Queens Boulevard — once known to residents as the “Boulevard of Death” because of its high number of traffic fatalities. The changes include parking-protected curbside bike lanes; pedestrian islands to shorten crossing distances and encourage drivers to make slower, safer turns; and adjustments to traffic signal timing to give pedestrians more time to cross before lights turn green for drivers.
“Now, thanks to changes to the street’s design, traffic injuries and fatalities are down and the street is safer for everyone,” Ydanis Rodriguez, the city’s traffic commissioner, said in a statement at the time.
The project, Rodriguez said, “serves as a reminder that our street redesigns save lives — regardless of whether you are biking, driving, or walking.”

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Combined with other factors, President Donald Trump’s big tariffs on Chinese goods are costing Ohio farmers and their counterparts in other states heavily, according to a new report.
 The report shows Ohio farmers lost nearly $76 million of their exports to China this year compared to one year earlier.
Tariffs are taxes on imports, and since the start of his second term, Trump has imposed a shifting array of them on every country in the world — except Russia for some reason, according to the Atlantic Council’s Tariff Tracker.
Economists have said the unpredictability of the measures has slowed some business investment because decision-makers can’t plan. And surveys conducted by the Federal Bank of Cleveland show that regional businesses are seeing higher input costs from them and many are raising prices for their customers.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
That’s not helpful as Republicans struggle to deal with a national affordability crisis.
Farmers have faced a double whammy. They’ve seen many of their costs go up because of the import taxes. 
Meanwhile, China — the country’s third-largest trading partner — stopped purchases of American soybeans in May before resuming them last month. The stoppage was in retaliation for the tariffs Trump imposed that now are at 20%, according to the tariff tracker.
That could do lasting harm to Ohio soybean producers by pushing China to grow and cement its trade ties with Brazil — another major producer. 
Trump imposed 50% tariffs on the South American country in retaliation for imprisoning an authoritarian president who attempted a coup.
Ohio farmers are feeling the pain. 
Steady trade relations with China had already been roiled during the first Trump administration, according to Farm Flavor, a media organization that reports on agriculture.
“Over the past decade, the flow of American agricultural goods to China has shifted from reliable seasonality to stark volatility,” it said in a report that was released on Tuesday. 
“From 2014 to 2017, exports followed a predictable rhythm throughout the year, peaking each fall with the soybean harvest. That pattern broke with the onset of the 2018 trade war, then rebounded sharply in 2020 and 2021 after the Phase One trade agreement. With Chinese purchasing commitments in place, monthly exports hit record highs in late 2020 and remained elevated through 2022 – fueling optimism that the relationship had stabilized.”
Then in 2023, Brazil saw record soybean and corn harvests, undercutting prices asked by U.S. farmers. And in the wake of the first Trump trade war, China worked to “de-risk” its agricultural supply by strengthening ties with South America, the report said.
“By 2025, these forces — combined with a renewed trade war — converged into a full collapse,” it said. 
“After steady declines in 2024, U.S. agricultural exports to China fell by more than half in the first eight months of 2025. The low point came in May, when monthly exports dropped to just $247 million – the lowest level in over a decade.”
Analyzing export data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Farm Flavor report said that Ohio farmers were the 13th hardest-hit, losing nearly three-quarters, or $76 million, of their exports to China this year compared to a year earlier. 
Ohio soybean farmers bore the brunt, losing 85% of their exports to China.
Trump to send $12 billion in one-time payments to farmers to offset ag losses

Six of the 10 hardest-hit states voted for Trump last year, and the administration might be feeling the heat. Last Tuesday, the president announced a $12 billion bailout of the sector.
But skeptics questioned how a one-time expenditure will make up for a systemic loss that already dwarfs the bailout. 
Agricultural trade with China alone is $17 billion less this year than it was last, or 42% more than the total bailout.
Nearly across the board, U.S. agricultural exports to China have been way down this year compared to their 2024 levels, according to USDA data compiled by Farm Flavor. 
A sampling, listed in order of total volume:

Soybeans — 53%
Cotton — 89%
Beef — 54%

Corn — 99%

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-16 10:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"For pizza joints and ‘college places,’ Storrs can be a tough market",Kwasi Osei-Amankwah and P.R. Lockhart,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/16/uconn-storrs-business-restaurants-closure/,"In the past decade, several small businesses near UConn’s campus have shut down. Others have come and gone.","When Shaun Comins moved from Glastonbury to Storrs in 2007 to attend the University of Connecticut, his dream was to become an English teacher. It was the need for some extra cash that led him to a job at Sgt. Pepperoni, a local restaurant that had been serving the Storrs community since 1992.
Comins climbed the ranks quickly, becoming a trusted leader in the restaurant. Once he graduated, the “burned out” Comins decided to continue working at the restaurant to pay off his college expenses. That’s when an opportunity presented itself.
The then-owners of Sgt. Pepperoni, who had moved out of state years earlier, leaving Comins in the role of general manager, were looking to sell the restaurant. They offered it to Comins for around $175,000, and Comins accepted.
Along with his spouse, Sam Tolhus, who’d previously worked at Sgt. Pepperoni, the couple continued serving pizza to the UConn community for another 10 years. 
But by the early 2020s they were drained and looking to do something new — to change locations or possibly sell the business to keep the Sgt. Pepperoni namesake alive. When they learned the building’s landlord had decided to sell the property, they faced a sudden time limit, a limit that ultimately forced them into a difficult decision: closing the restaurant. 
It’s a decision that still stings for many students and alumni.
Sgt. Pepperoni’s fate isn’t unique. In the past decade, several small businesses near UConn’s campus have shut down. Sarah’s Pockets, Wally’s Chicken Coop, Baja Cafe, Husky Pizza and many others have come and gone, replaced by restaurants and other businesses that either sink or swim in the tough Storrs market.
“A lot of those restaurants were right by us,” Tolhus said. “Watching them all go one by one was sad.”
When Sgt. Pepperoni closed its doors in 2023, students and longtime customers didn’t just lose a pizza spot — they lost a piece of campus tradition. The restaurant sat on North Eagleville Road, just downstairs from Huskies Bar and Restaurant, becoming a haven for students seeking late-night slices, families grabbing a quick bite before basketball games and anyone looking for a meal after a night out.
For Tolhus and Comins, the loss of their shop wasn’t just about rent and expenses — it was about how fragile small businesses can be in a college town where the customer base flows with the student calendar, where campus space is shifting constantly and where long hours and late nights are necessary. 
“Each way this campus has changed since we’ve been here has made it harder for a small delivery business to operate,” Tolhus said.

Running ‘a college place’ can come with challenges
The restaurant industry has long been known as a volatile one, with owners needing to navigate a complex web of trends, shifts in consumer habits and rising costs. These calculations can become especially difficult in college towns, which see significant changes in foot traffic depending on whether school is in session.
At UConn, those challenges have been compounded by another factor: a shifting student population. In recent years the school has grown rapidly, with the incoming freshman class of 2029 expected to be roughly 21,100 students, a new enrollment record for the Storrs campus. 
That growth has sparked a wave of development on campus, including new dining facilities and academic buildings. The growth has also brought new challenges for businesses operating in Storrs, as off-campus residential and commercial development seeks to keep up with new demand. 
On one hand, so many students can be a boost to a business. But when those students leave — on break temporarily, or at graduation, for good — it can make things harder to navigate. “One thing I don’t think people realize about businesses on college campuses is the split between the students and the locals,” Comins said. “Once a place gets labeled as ‘a college place’ locals won’t tend to go there.”
“It makes things tough when the students go,” he added. 
The ebbs and flows of students can make things difficult in other ways. Comins said Sgt. Pepperoni focused the bulk of its annual operations on busy hours during the school year, closing during the shorter winter and spring breaks and adjusting hours when opened in the summer to focus on lunch service. 
“Historically, the old owners never opened over the summer. They never even tried,” Comins said. “We did try, but it was tough.”
The restaurant also had to weather national changes like the pandemic, which heavily affected college towns and campus dining, a category that includes on-campus dining halls as well as restaurants and food businesses where college students make up a sizable portion of customers. Inflation also drove up costs, which for a place selling slices at college student prices made it difficult to turn a profit.
“COVID had a huge impact on collegiate dining,” said Robert Nelson, the president and CEO of the National Association of College & University Food Services. “I believe, though, it really had a huge impact on food service nationwide, on or off campus, in community towns, in communities with campuses and without campuses.”
Those issues compounded already present challenges for the food industry. “If you think about the last five to 10 years, even further past the pandemic, there’s all these things that the restaurant sector has gone through,” said Chad Moutray, a chief economist for the National Restaurant Association. “From trade wars, to the pandemic, to supply chain disruptions, and worker shortages, right? There was a lot of inflation right in that period of time, as well.”
In the years since, the restaurant industry has largely bounced back from the lows of the pandemic, though persistent inflation and the growth of takeout dining have become post-pandemic “hangovers” of sorts according to Moutray. 
Comins told the Connecticut Mirror that Sgt. Pepperoni was able to receive some grant and local support during the pandemic, which helped the business stay afloat and kept it from many of the struggles food businesses in the state faced at the time. But the business soon faced a different challenge that ultimately led to closure.

A sudden end
Before closing down, Tolhus and Comins had hoped to sell the business. But the couple ran into issues getting their landlord to agree the lease terms potential buyers had requested.
As time went on, Tolhus started to hear rumors from other businesses nearby that the landlord planned to sell the building. The landlord later made the couple an offer: They could receive a one-year lease at a bigger discount than what they were paying, but after the lease ended in mid-2024 the building would be torn down. 
The couple declined. “We told her no to the lease,” Comins said. “We were still salty about the whole situation.”

In April 2023, they announced on social media that Sgt. Pepperoni would close later in the summer, also posting a video of memories of more than a decade running the restaurant.  
“As people leave Storrs and move back home, we will bake our last pie,” the couple wrote. 
The Connecticut Mirror made multiple attempts to reach the building’s former landlord, Freda Sanderson, to discuss Sgt. Pepperoni’s lease, but did not receive a response. 
Earlier this year, a Georgia-based real estate firm announced it had purchased the former Sgt. Pepperoni building, and would use the site to provide housing near campus — a need that’s grown in recent years. The site will be redeveloped into The Mark Mansfield, a mixed-use development that includes 738 housing units for students and 7,000 feet of retail space. The property is currently slated to be completed in 2028.

For food businesses, Storrs can be a competitive environment
In conversations with the Connecticut Mirror, business owners and industry experts noted that surviving in Storrs can be complicated, particularly as development needs in the area shift. Students can be a tough client base to engage, in part because young people are constantly flowing on and off campus and are often looking for new things to try.
“I think if you’re going to build a business, a food business, specifically on a college campus, you have to tap into their curiosity,” said Katrice Claudio, the food program manager for reSET, a nonprofit that offers incubator programs for startup businesses. “If they know what a Buffalo wing tastes like, they’re not going to go above and beyond to get yours.” 
That challenge hasn’t stopped numerous businesses from cropping up in the area. According to the Mansfield Downtown Partnership, which handles economic development work and some community programming for downtown Storrs and the broader town of Mansfield, there are more than 70 businesses and organizations currently operating in downtown Storrs. That includes a mix of independent small businesses, national chains, local franchises and other operations. 
When it comes to local businesses, “I think the one sort of unique characteristic is we’re very food heavy,” said Steven Ferrigno, the executive director for the partnership. “I think that’s because we are adjacent to 20,000 hungry undergrads.” 
Ferrigno said businesses that do well in Storrs are able to expand their customer base beyond the student population, finding ways to appeal to local residents and nearby towns as well. “The town residents are going to be kind of the core that help support you year round, and then the students kind of help bump you up when they’re around,” he said. 
The partnership works to help many of these businesses as they set up in the area providing resources and helping make broader connections. 
That was the case for Nikki’s Dog House, a restaurant that opened in the area in July. The restaurant has had a location in Putnam for 45 years. The new restaurant in Storrs is its second location. 
Restaurant owner Larry Groh, who runs the business with his wife Erica (their daughter Ali serves as the Storrs location’s manager) said that opening in Storrs was a chance to bring new business to an area that would be receptive to their classic menu of hot dogs, burgers, and old-fashioned milkshakes.
“It’s just like starting any new business where you have to get your name out there and go into the community,” Groh said of building out the Nikki’s customer base in its first months. The Mansfield Downtown Partnership has helped with some advertising and also organized a ribbon-cutting ceremony for the restaurant. 
And while the restaurant is looking forward to engaging with UConn and has already served plenty of students, Groh said the business will work to appeal to as many people as possible. 
“We’re not bringing down Nikki’s Dog House just for the college students,” he said. “We’re bringing it down for the local communities as well.” 
At a time where economic conditions are shifting nationally, Ferrigno said he is optimistic about the business climate in the area. “I think people see the potential and the growth at UConn and the growth in that market, and they’re like, ‘you know what,  this is an exciting place to be,’” he said.

A lingering campus memory
When you ask students and alumni today, many still remember eating at Sgt. Pepperoni during their first fun night at UConn or ordering delivery during a late-night study session. The youngest students who had the chance to eat at the restaurant are set to be rising seniors next year. When those students graduate in 2027, they will be taking some of the last remaining student memories of Sgt. Pepperoni with them. 
After running the business for a decade, Comins and Tolhus said the memories will always linger.
Since the closure, the couple often find themselves looking back, fondly recalling late nights when the dining room was full or when they recognized returning students. Tolhus said some of her strongest memories are of the staff. Many became close friends who she still keeps up with. 
Running the business for so long has transformed the former restaurant owners in other ways.
“I grew up here,” Tolhus said. “I wasn’t an adult when I started here and I was one when I left.”  
In recent years, Tolhus and Comins have worked multiple jobs, including stints at restaurants near UConn’s campus. Tolhus is currently not working due to health issues, while Comins works as a manager at Connecticut Hall, the newest dining hall on UConn’s campus. 
“But nothing feels the same as running your own place, because it’s yours,” Tolhus said.
When walking around UConn’s Susan Herbst Hall,you might still spot Sgt. Pepperoni merchandise. Their stickers dot surfaces around campus, and student-run social media accounts still mention nostalgia for the restaurant.
In time, these things will mean little to new students attending the university. The building where Sgt. Pepperoni once stood has already been torn down, soon to be replaced with hundreds of apartments as the region continues to usher in redevelopment. Other restaurants and small businesses will move into vacant spots around campus, ready to take their chance on making sales to incoming UConn students. 
Tolhus and Comins said they still feel the love students had for Sgt. Pepperoni. But at this point, after years poured into the business and the challenges they faced running it, they doubt a comeback would ever be possible. 
“I don’t think people realize how hard it is sometimes [to run a small business],” Comins said. “Even if you gave me a million dollars, I don’t think I can go back anymore.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/STORRS-BUSINESSES-KOA-5-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-16 05:56:25.664798

Mike DeWine gives the State of the State address in the Ohio House chambers at the Ohio Statehouse on Wednesday, March 12, 2025 in Columbus, Ohio. (Pool photo by Samantha Madar, Columbus Dispatch.)The Ohio Board of Pharmacy issued an emergency ruling Friday banning most kratom products. 
This was in response to Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine once again asking the Ohio Board of Pharmacy to designate all natural and synthetic kratom compounds as illegal drugs last week.  
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
DeWine originally made this request in August, but paused his call for a kratom ban after talking with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. 
“In reviewing this issue over the past few weeks, national experts, including the (Food and Drug Administration), agree that synthetic kratom compounds should be scheduled as illegal,” DeWine said in a statement last week. 
The Ohio Board of Pharmacy’s emergency rule makes it illegal to sell, possess, or distribute any kratom-related products — including synthetic 7-hydroxymitragynine, known as 7-OH. Products composed solely of mitragynine, including natural kratom in its vegetation form, are the only exception. A product containing mitragynine and another derivative form of kratom, such as 7-OH, would be illegal to sell, possess, or distribute. 
The emergency ruling is in effect for 180 days, meaning it will expire on June 10, 2026. The Board said it will propose a permanent rule to ban all kratom-related products during this time. 
Kratom is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia and its leaves can be crushed and smoked, brewed or placed in gel capsules. Consuming it at low doses can lead to stimulant effects while high doses can lead to sedative effects. People often take kratom to treat chronic pain, opioid dependence, anxiety, and depression. 
Examples of kratom-related products, photo from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
The 2023 National Survey on Drug Use & Health estimates there are 1.6 million annual kratom users in the United States. Reported side effects of kratom include high blood pressure, confusion, seizures, weight loss, vomiting, dizziness, and drowsiness. 
Kratom is not controlled under the Controlled Substances Act and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration warns against using kratom because of adverse risk effects such as liver toxicity, seizures, and substance use disorder. 
The synthetic version of kratom, concentrated with 7-OH, is an opioid-like substance and over the summer the FDA recommended scheduling 7-OH products under the Controlled Substances Act. The FDA clarified they are not focused on natural kratom leaf products. 
Poison control centers in the United States received more than 3,400 reports about kratom use — including death — from 2014 to 2019, according to the Mayo Clinic. Kratom was the cause of death in more than 200 unintentional overdoses deaths in Ohio from 2019 to 2024, according to preliminary data from the Ohio Department of Health. 
However, most deaths from kratom also involved other drugs or substances, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. 
“While there is a clear path to take action on synthetic kratom, I still have deep concerns about natural kratom, given the harms, including fatalities, attributed to it,” DeWine said. “Pursuing the regular rule process for a ban on natural kratom will allow for hearings, testimony, and a deliberative process.”
Ohio Sen. Bill Blessing, R-Colerain Township, introduced Ohio Senate Bill 299, which would regulate natural kratom products and ban the synthetic version. The bill has had sponsor testimony.
Ohio Republican State Reps. Mike Odioso and Brian Lorenz recently introduced Ohio House Bill 587, a companion bill. 
It is illegal to buy, use or possess kratom in Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin. Kratom is illegal in some countries including Australia, Denmark, Israel, and Japan, among others.

Kelly Ayotte this year, she also vetoed a dozen. On Wednesday, the House will attempt to override 11 of the governor's vetoes. Here, Ayotte signs legislation in February. (Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)When Kelly Ayotte assumed the governor’s office in January, the Republican did so with an undeniable political advantage: a state House and Senate with firm Republican majorities to back her policies.
But despite her party’s dominance, the governor’s approach to politics has at times clashed with the more socially and fiscally conservative approaches of lawmakers in her party. This week, those differences will be put to the test. 
Ayotte vetoed 12 bills in the 2025 session, bucking fellow Republicans on hot-button issues such as transgender bathroom rights and book removals in schools. On Wednesday, the House will meet to attempt to overturn Ayotte’s vetoes of 11 House bills. The Senate already met in October and voted to uphold Ayotte’s veto of Senate Bill 213, which would have expanded the prohibition on electioneering by public employees. 
With the House’s 217 Republicans making up just under 55% of the House’s current 395 sitting members, it is unlikely that any partisan bill will clear the two-thirds threshold to override a veto. But the debate on the floor could still be fierce.  
Here’s what will be debated on veto day.  
The transgender ‘bathroom bill’
One of the most fraught vetoed bills revolves around access to public spaces by transgender people.
House Bill 148 would allow businesses and organizations to separate bathrooms, locker rooms, and sports teams by biological sex at birth, exempting them from state anti-discrimination laws that protect gender identity. The bill would also enable jails, juvenile detention centers, mental health hospitals, or “like facilities” to separate people by biological sex as well.
The state’s anti-discrimination statute has prevented classification that impinges on someone’s gender identity since 2019, when then-Gov. Chris Sununu signed a law adding gender identity to the existing protections for housing, employment, and access to public spaces.
Proponents of HB 148 say it would allow businesses to make certain private spaces safer for cisgender women; critics call it a “bathroom ban” and say it harms transgender people.
In her veto message, Ayotte said supporters of the bill had brought up “important and legitimate privacy and safety concerns” regarding private spaces, but added she believed it is “overly broad” and would create an “exclusionary environment.”
Tools for school book bans
Conservative lawmakers have also attempted to allow for more book removals in schools. House Bill 324 would require school boards to adopt new procedures for how parents can challenge books and other materials they deem obscene or harmful. 
The bill would mandate the creation of a complaint process for parents to call for the removal of a book or other content that is harmful to minors. Under the bill, content deemed harmful would include depictions or descriptions of nudity or sexual activity that “lacks serious literary, scientific, medical, artistic, or political value for minors” and that is not appropriate to their specific age level.
Republican supporters say it would allow for easier removal of what they have called pornography in schools. Opponents labeled it a “book ban,” and said it would diminish local control; the bill would give the State Board of Education, whose members are appointed by the governor, the final say over whether the material should be removed.
In her veto message, Ayotte wrote that while she understands the concerns about age-inappropriate materials, there is already a state law that allows parents to opt their own child out of any instructional material they object to. “Therefore, I do not believe the State of New Hampshire needs to, nor should it, engage in the role of addressing questions of literary value and appropriateness,” she wrote. 
The governor raised the possibility of school districts being burdened with civil litigation over the law, and of facing monetary penalties.
An easier vaccine exemption process
Ayotte also vetoed a bill that seeks to change the process for parents in New Hampshire to receive a religious exemption for vaccine mandates for their children. If the veto is overturned, House Bill 358 will allow parents to receive an exemption by simply providing a written statement that the child hasn’t been vaccinated due to a religious belief. Currently, parents have to complete a specific form.
When vetoing the bill in July, Ayotte emphasized the “important role” childhood immunizations play in “preventing the resurgence and spread of previously deadly diseases.” She wrote in her veto message: “While parents must be the final decision makers on what immunizations their child receives, the State already has an established process by which parents can claim a religious exemption, and I see no reason to change it.”
Partisan school board elections
One vetoed bill would transform local school elections. House Bill 356 would allow school districts to make their school board elections partisan, meaning candidates would be identified on the ballot by their party. The bill would create a path for voters in that school district to pass a warrant article enabling those partisan labels; that article would need a simple majority to pass. 
Ayotte wholly opposes the idea: She wrote in her veto message that it would create “unnecessary division” among residents. “Local school board elections are run properly and in a nonpartisan manner, and there is no need to fix a system that is not broken,” she wrote.
Required fetus viewing in school
Lawmakers also passed a bill this year that mandated public school health classes show students a video of a fetus. Specifically, House Bill 667 requires those health classes to show “a high-quality computer-generated animation or ultrasound video that shows the development of the heart, brain, and other vital organs in early fetal development.”
Lawmakers, including one of the bill’s supporters, Rep. Glenn Cordelli, framed the bill as an effort to teach children about gestational science and to foster “empathy and compassion towards the pre-born children.”
In July, Ayotte, in vetoing the bill, said she doesn’t think it’s “an appropriate role for the State to be mandating such requirements.”
An end to half-day kindergarten transportation
In a bid to reduce costs to school districts, Republican lawmakers have sought to remove some transportation mandates. House Bill 319 would have exempted public school districts from the requirement to provide transportation to half-day kindergarten students, and only require that for full-day kindergarten. 
But Ayotte opposed the loosened restrictions, writing in her veto message that allowing schools to drop that transportation would “place an undue burden on working families.”
Higher hurdles for non-academic surveys
Since 1990, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Youth Risk Behavior Survey has been conducted at schools to collect anonymous information about student alcohol and drug use, mental health challenges, and sexual activity. 
But conservatives have long called for stricter parental consent requirements. House Bill 446 would require parents to opt in to non-academic surveys in public schools, changing the current law, which allows them an opt-out. According to state law, those include surveys asking students about social behavior, family life, religion, politics, sexual orientation, sexual activity, drug use, and more. 
Conservatives argue the Youth Risk Behavior Survey is invasive and inappropriate, and say parents should not be required to opt out to prevent them from being administered to children. 
But Ayotte wrote in her veto message that she had heard “tremendous concern” about the bill from mental health and substance use disorder advocates, who said the data helps them to measure the depth of certain problems, allocate funding and services toward them, and see if they improve. Ayotte wrote that if the survey were made to be opt-in and participation decreased, it would “undermine the reliability of the data collected, jeopardizing efforts to respond to the needs of vulnerable youth in our state.” 
An exception to the accessible voting machine mandate
One vetoed bill was meant to accompany a new law requiring cities and towns to provide accessible voting machines in local elections. House Bill 613 would give cities and towns a potential exemption from that law. 
The bill would allow those municipalities to post a message requesting that anyone who would like to use accessible voting machines at a local election to write in a request to that town at least 60 days before Election Day. If no letter were received by then, that town would not need to provide the accessible machines at the polls, according to the bill. 
Sponsors of the bill said it would give some flexibility to towns with very low populations in which no residents have expressed a need for assorted machines, saving them on the costs of programming those machines. But in vetoing the bill, Ayotte wrote that it “impacts people with disabilities and would conflict with federal law that requires accessible voting systems be available at all polling places during federal elections.”
Automatic elimination of empty positions
Lawmakers will also have the opportunity Wednesday to override Ayotte’s veto on House Bill 475. HB 475 would amend the default budget process for New Hampshire towns so that positions that sit vacant for a year would be eliminated from the town’s budget. 
In her veto message, Ayotte wrote that this was a threat to towns’ ability to recruit and retain first responders. She explained that the New Hampshire Association of Fire Chiefs and Association of Police Chiefs have told her the bill, “should it be signed into law, will have far-reaching effects for public safety … [and] increase the length of time for roads to be plowed, fire department coverage, police response, and staffing.”
Leftover bills
Two vetoed bills up for a vote Wednesday have become redundant since first being passed. The first, House Bill 115, would have authorized a continuing resolution in June to allow the state government to remain open while lawmakers hammered out a resolution to deep-set differences between Republican lawmakers and the governor over the budget. That bill was made irrelevant on June 26, when the House voted to approve a compromise budget by one vote, 184-183.
The second bill, House Bill 781, would require school boards to ban cell phone use in schools. Doing so was a major priority of Ayotte’s this year, but HB 781 took a different approach than Ayotte’s preferred method. Ayotte wanted a strict “bell-to-bell” ban in which phones would be banned all day, while HB 781 gave schools more opportunity for exemptions. 
In the end, the Legislature kept the governor’s stricter version in House Bill 2, the budget trailer bill; it is now law and schools have adopted the policy for this school year. If lawmakers overrode Ayotte’s veto of HB 781, the less restrictive approach would become law.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/P2273065-Ayotte-signs-SB-4-1024x780.jpg,,,2025-12-16 04:57:13.223487

(Photo by Adria Malcolm for KFF Health News)Nancy Hunt arrived at an emergency room from a Genesis HealthCare nursing home in Pennsylvania in such dreadful shape, including maggots infesting her gangrened foot, that the hospital called an elder abuse hotline and then the police, her son alleged in a lawsuit.
Hunt died five days later. Her death certificate said the foot injury was a “significant” factor. Genesis denied wrongdoing but agreed to pay $3.5 million in a settlement Hunt’s son signed in August 2024.
Yet Genesis hasn’t paid most of that debt, court records show. It may never have to.
Once the nation’s largest nursing home chain, Genesis says it was spending $8 million a month defending and settling lawsuits over resident injuries and deaths in recent years. But the company is now poised to wipe the liability slate clean by seeking refuge in the most protective corner of the legal system for the nursing home industry: bankruptcy court.
The Genesis case, one of 11 large senior care bankruptcies this year, illustrates how health care companies can dodge public and financial accountability for alleged negligence through delays, confidentiality clauses, and bankruptcy maneuvers, a KFF Health News investigation found.
When it filed for bankruptcy in Dallas in July, Genesis estimated its total liability for nearly a thousand settled and pending lawsuits at $259 million. A KFF Health News review of the terms of 155 settlement agreements and corporate financial statements shows Genesis officials knew insolvency was possible yet included provisions in its settlement agreements allowing it to defer payment, often for a year or more.
As a result, Genesis paid nothing in 85 cases and only a portion in the other 70, according to civil court records and bankruptcy claims made available through people with access to them. It still owes $41 million of the $58 million it had agreed to pay in those cases, the records show.
Nellie Betancourt, shown in a photo with her husband, Gabe, had planned a trip to Las Vegas before she fractured her hip at a Genesis HealthCare rehabilitation center — an injury the medical examiner’s report said led to her death. “When she went into that place, I said, ‘Well, she’s going to be taken care of for a few more days and I’ll take her home,’” Gabe says.

“It just feels like they killed my mom and got away with it,” said Vanessa Betancourt, whose mother, Nellie Betancourt, a retired nurse, fractured her hip at a Genesis home in Albuquerque, New Mexico — an injury the medical examiner’s report said led to her death. Genesis agreed to a $650,000 settlement with Betancourt’s family in April under the condition it would not need to pay the first of seven installments for another year, according to the settlement document.

Genesis denied wrongdoing in all lawsuits and settlements. In a written statement, the company did not answer questions about individual personal injury cases. The statement said Genesis remained “focused on delivering high-quality, compassionate care to our patients and residents without disruption” during bankruptcy.
One lawsuit Genesis settled for nearly $1 million alleged nursing home managers ignored repeated warnings about a male resident’s behavior before he sexually assaulted a female Alzheimer’s patient, according to court records. In a case the company resolved for $500,000, a Genesis nursing home was accused of delaying the hospitalization of a resident who had vomited brown mucus. He died of a bowel obstruction. Genesis has paid nothing for either settlement, according to bankruptcy claims.
Creditors, including families of the deceased, are expected to salvage a fraction of what they were promised, if anything. On Dec. 10, the company’s owners were scheduled to seek approval by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas to sell its nursing homes and other assets to its largest investor, a private equity firm. In court papers, lawyers for residents and other creditors say the complex plan will prevent them from pursuing Genesis’ new ownership and other companies they blame for the company’s collapse.
John Anthony, a bankruptcy attorney representing 340 personal injury claims against Genesis, said, “They never had any intention to honor these deals.”
Low ratings and fines
During years of financial turmoil, Genesis has frequently struggled to provide top-notch care, federal records show. Using its five-star system, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services rated 58% of homes affiliated with Genesis as below average or much below average. CMS has fined Genesis homes $10 million for violating federal health standards over the past three years.
In 2022, Connecticut health regulators shuttered a Genesis home after two deaths and multiple violations. The company closed another Connecticut nursing home this year after residents twice were evacuated over safety concerns.
In its Chapter 11 filing, Genesis said it cared for about 15,000 residents in 165 nursing homes and 10 assisted living facilities in 18 states. They are centered in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, New Mexico, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Maine, Alabama, Maryland, and North Carolina, according to the bankruptcy filing.

The company said it owed $709 million in secured debt to lenders and the IRS. Under bankruptcy rules, those debts, backed by Genesis collateral, take precedence over the $1.6 billion in unsecured debt Genesis said it owes. Unsecured creditors include a pension fund; contractors that provided health services and equipment; Pennsylvania, New Mexico, and West Virginia for unpaid provider taxes; and former residents and their families who sued.
Dangers in memory care
Sandia Ridge Center, a Genesis home in Albuquerque, was repeatedly faulted by health regulators for not preventing sexual misbehavior in its memory care unit. In November 2021, CMS cited the home for lacking enough nurses to prevent sexual abuse among residents. An inspection report the following August identified more inappropriate sexual contact. Police were called to investigate sexual assault allegations in February and March of 2023, police reports show; neither resulted in criminal charges.
Then in April 2023, a 61-year-old male resident with alcohol-related dementia sexually assaulted a female resident with Alzheimer’s in the dining room, according to a police report and an inspection report. When the resident screamed for him to stop and that he was hurting her, he responded “shut up bitch I know you like this,” according to a lawsuit brought on behalf of the woman, identified in court papers as R.S.
Sandia Ridge management had been aware of the male resident’s behavioral issues for months, according to employee depositions in the case. Police had investigated a prior sexual assault allegation against him the previous year without bringing charges. In one deposition, a former activities assistant testified he hit her and twice pushed her into a bathroom while announcing, “I want to have sex with you.” When she reported him to a senior Genesis manager, she said in the deposition, the manager put his finger over his lips and said, “Shhh.”
The activities worker testified that R.S. used to happily sing along with Elvis Presley songs. After the assault, the worker said, R.S. “don’t sing anymore.”
Inspectors cited the home for failing to protect R.S. The same report said the home didn’t provide a therapist for another female resident who was being sexually harassed. Medicare fined Sandia Ridge Center $91,247. Genesis denied liability but settled R.S.’ lawsuit for $925,000 in May, according to the bankruptcy claim.
“We just felt we have to hold them accountable,” R.S.’ daughter said in an interview, speaking on the condition that she and her mother not be identified, because of the nature of the assault. “Maybe I’m wrong, maybe I’m naive, but the only way to do that is to sue someone, right?”
Genesis has not paid any of the settlement, according to the family’s claim filing.

Growth and debt
Genesis’ downfall can be traced to 2007, when affiliates of two private equity firms acquired the company in a $1.5 billion leveraged buyout, taking on substantial debt, according to its bankruptcy filing. Private equity also has been involved in other health care bankruptcies, including those of the HCR ManorCare nursing home chain, the prison health care contractor Corizon Health, and two for-profit hospital systems, Steward Health Care and Prospect Medical Holdings.
In 2011, Genesis raised $2.4 billion by transferring substantially all its nursing home buildings and other real estate to Welltower, a publicly traded real estate investment trust, according to Genesis’ bankruptcy filing. Genesis then rented the buildings back from Welltower, which made leasing costs a significant expense.
Genesis went on a nationwide buying spree. At its peak in 2016, it had grown to more than 500 nursing homes. In a court declaration, Louis Robichaux IV, a consultant overseeing Genesis’ bankruptcy restructuring, wrote that as the company expanded, it became harder to manage and “mired in corporate inefficiencies.” Robichaux wrote that Genesis’ financial woes were exacerbated by rapidly increasing labor costs and lawsuits, including some predating the covid pandemic.
Starting in 2021, Genesis avoided bankruptcy after receiving $100 million in loans from a private equity firm founded by Joel Landau, the owner of a Brooklyn-based nursing home chain, according to Robichaux’s filing.
But Genesis continued to teeter on the edge of insolvency. In audited financial statements for 2022 and 2023 submitted to a California oversight agency, management and auditors said rent and debt obligations raised “substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern.”
In a court filing, a committee appointed by the U.S. Trustee’s Office to represent the unsecured creditors in the bankruptcy accused Landau and Welltower of orchestrating a covert plan that allowed Welltower to keep getting its rents while Landau could run the company and “siphon value to himself.” The committee alleged their efforts forced the company into insolvency while “staffing levels and patient care declined precipitously.” Landau and Welltower did not respond to requests for comment.
Drawn-out lawsuits
Erin Pearson sued Genesis over the death of her father, James Sanderson, a retired mining company executive who died in 2018 after spending less than a month at Bear Canyon Rehabilitation Center in Albuquerque. In the memory care unit, Sanderson fell repeatedly, suffered medication errors made by nursing home staff, and developed a bowel obstruction and sepsis, according to the lawsuit, filed in 2019. Pearson’s lawyers said he was not hospitalized until eight days after nurses noticed he was vomiting brown mucus.

After the judge rejected Genesis’ request to force Pearson into arbitration, Genesis appealed. It took 2½ years before an appeals court affirmed the original decision to let the case go forward in court, records show.
This past May, more than five years after suing, Pearson reached a $500,000 settlement, with the first payment required by November, according to a copy of the agreement. Nothing was paid, according to the bankruptcy claim.
“It was so drawn out and for so long,” Pearson said in an interview, calling Genesis’ bankruptcy “despicable.”
Payouts postponed
Jennifer Foote, an Albuquerque attorney who represents clients in multiple lawsuits against Genesis, including Pearson’s, said the company frequently filed appeals. “They did not usually win them on these issues,” she said, “and our sense was that they were doing it as a delay tactic.”
Genesis started using installment payments around 2018, said Dusti Harvey, Foote’s law partner. “The payments wouldn’t start for several months out,” Harvey said. Foote said Genesis’ lawyers often wanted to time the payments to start the month the trial in the case was scheduled to occur.
Families had to wait even when comparatively small amounts of money were involved, settlement agreements show. Genesis’ settlement agreements also included a confidentiality clause prohibiting discussion of the incidents.
Genesis agreed to pay $42,000 in a November 2024 settlement, but the first payment was not due until nine months later. It was not paid, according to the bankruptcy claim.
A $250,000 settlement signed in October 2023 did not start paying out until the following September. When Genesis declared bankruptcy — 21 months after the case was resolved — it still owed $100,000, according to the family’s claim.
‘We never found out the truth’
Settling cases allowed Genesis to avoid the expense and publicity of a trial, at which details of how its nursing homes functioned might have been revealed. In October 2020, Margarett Johnson, a retired school bus driver, fell out of her wheelchair at a Genesis nursing home in Waldorf, Maryland, fracturing her jawbone, nose, and neck, according to a lawsuit brought by her family. Johnson was sent to a trauma center and placed on a ventilator. She died three months later, at age 76, from ventilator-associated pneumonia, the lawsuit said.
“It looked like she was hit by a truck,” Angelina Harley, one of her daughters, said in an interview. “I knew my mom was not going to come home. I knew the Lord was not going to punish her more.”
Genesis HealthCare still owes $112,500 from a $950,000 settlement over the death of Margarett Johnson after an accident in a Maryland nursing home, according to a bankruptcy claim. She is seen here with her brother William Tolson.(Angela Swann)
The company denied negligence and blamed the accident on Johnson’s jacket getting tangled in the wheel of her wheelchair, according to the lawsuit. Harley and her sister Angela Swann were dubious.
“We never found out the truth,” Harley said. “They wanted to settle out of court.”
The company denied liability but agreed to a $950,000 settlement in October 2024. It never paid the final $112,500 installment, according to a letter Johnson’s five children sent to the bankruptcy judge.
“If you settle out of court, you know doggone well you did something wrong,” Harley said.
Maddening judges
By summer 2025, judges in some civil cases had run out of patience.
Alma Brown, a retired day care manager and accordion teacher living in a Genesis nursing home in Clovis, New Mexico, suffered falls, infections, bedsores, and other neglect that hastened her death in 2023, according to her estate’s lawsuit. In Santa Fe District Court, Judge Kathleen McGarry Ellenwood castigated Genesis after it failed to pay $2 million of the $3 million settlement to Brown’s estate or explain the delay.
Genesis “obviously benefited by not having to go to trial,” McGarry Ellenwood said in one hearing, according to a court transcript. “They assure me that they’re not trying to renege on their contract, but it certainly seems like they haven’t lived up to what the bargain was.”
Genesis declared bankruptcy the day McGarry Ellenwood announced she would impose more than $100,000 in fines, plus $10,000 more each day until the settlement was paid.
In Pennsylvania, Greg Hunt petitioned a judge to punish Genesis after it stopped payments of the $3.5 million settlement after the death of his mother, Nancy, the resident with the gangrenous foot. She had spent eight months in 2019 at Brandywine Hall, a Genesis facility in West Chester that was later sold and renamed.
In a filing with the Common Pleas Court of Montgomery County, Genesis admitted it was in arrears but asked the judge for more time, citing “unforeseen and exigent financial challenges.” Genesis said care for patients at its nursing homes would suffer if it had to pay immediately.
Unswayed, Judge Richard Haaz in June ordered Genesis to pay up, along with punitive interest. But the bankruptcy court stayed that order. Genesis still owes $1.4 million of the $2 million it was supposed to pay, according to Hunt’s claim. (The rest of the $3.5 million settlement is supposed to be paid by an insurer in January 2026.) Ian Norris, Hunt’s lawyer, declined to comment, citing confidentiality provisions in the settlement.
Court records indicate Genesis lawyers never disclosed in either case that it was preparing to declare bankruptcy.
‘Bankruptcy as a tool’
In the first nine months of 2025, 10 other senior living companies with liabilities over $10 million entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy, according to Gibbins Advisors, a consulting firm.
Hamid Rafatjoo, a bankruptcy lawyer representing nursing homes who is not involved in the Genesis bankruptcy case, said filings may increase as the industry has become costlier to run and class action lawsuits have become a fixture.
“Nursing homes get sued all the time for everything,” Rafatjoo said. “A lot of operators wait too long to use bankruptcy as a tool.”
On Dec. 1, Genesis announced the results of its auction, saying it had elected to sell its assets to a private equity firm controlled by Landau. In a court filing, Anthony, the attorney for the personal injury claimants, alleged the auction was stacked in Landau’s favor despite an “objectively better and higher competing bid” from another private equity investor that would have provided more money to creditors. Genesis said in its statement that Landau’s group had increased its bid during the auction.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and two other senators last month asked the U.S. Trustee’s Office to intervene in the case, out of concern that “individuals who already own or control Genesis are trying to sell it to themselves, wiping away legal and other creditor debts in the process.” Lawyers representing those in charge of the auction did not respond to a request for comment.
Families of former Genesis residents said they fear the capacity to purge lawsuits through bankruptcy emboldens nursing home owners who provide deficient care.
“They can file bankruptcy again,” said Gabe Betancourt, whose wife, Nellie, died after her stay at Uptown Rehabilitation Center in Albuquerque. “And we’re the ones that will pay for it, with our memories, our lives.”
“It’s almost two years now,” Gabe Betancourt says of the death of his wife, Nellie. “When you sleep with somebody for 67 years and you stretch your arm, she’s there. There’s no way I will ever forget her.” (Photo by Adria Malcolm for KFF Health News)

(Photo by WEWS.)Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine needs to have more policy discussions and get to know GOP-supported Vivek Ramaswamy before endorsing him for governor, he said in a one-on-one interview last week.
For fifty years in the public eye, DeWine has walked his own path. As he finishes his term, at times, he’s diverged from the Republican party with vetoes, public statements and silence.
Once then-US Senator JD Vance became vice president, DeWine had to fill that seat. Cincinnati entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy had big ambitions and set his sights on leadership in the state, either in the Senate or as governor.
After passing over Ramaswamy to appoint former Lieutenant Governor Jon Husted, DeWine’s heir apparent, Ramaswamy made his plans clear and kicked off his campaign.
DeWine chose former OSU football coach Jim Tressel, a popular and widely known figure, as his new lieutenant governor and urged him to run for governor. But the Party endorsed Ramaswamy, against DeWine’s wishes, before Tressel got into the race. Still, the governor continued to say that there was still time.
In September, Tressel announced he would not run.


The following conversation has been edited for clarity and length. Although more topics were discussed with the governor, this story focuses on the questions around his legacy and political fight.
Trau: “You’ve been in politics for 50 years. You’ve been very successful in a lot of your endeavors: landslide elections, major companies coming to the state. How do you play your cards wrong when it comes to picking your successor to continue your legacy?”
DeWine: “Well, it’s up to the people to pick my successor, and my job is to do the best I can for eight years. I was very fortunate the people have given me two terms as governor of the state of Ohio. I think whoever the successor is, I’m sure that they care very, very deeply about Ohio and they’ll do a good job.”
Trau: “Of the two people who are seen as the top candidates, you have Amy Acton on the Democratic side, and you have Vivek Ramaswamy, who’s on the Republican side. You and he are very, very different in personality, but also policy beliefs. Do you feel comfortable endorsing somebody who differs from you on schools, health, education, immigration?”
DeWine: “Well, first of all, I’ve said I’m going to endorse the Republican nominee for governor. And Vivek and I have sat down and right here, and had a number of conversations, I think three very long conversations, and our plans are to continue to do that and have more conversations. I’m not sure that we’re that far apart, really. He has not been in office before, and what I’m simply trying to do is to relate some of the experiences that I’ve had, and also talk to him and hear from him about where he thinks Ohio needs to go and what his goals are.”
Trau: “Has Vivek Ramaswamy not earned your endorsement yet?”
DeWine: “I think it’s a process. I didn’t know him; I’ve met him a couple of times, but didn’t really know him. An endorsement is a serious thing. I don’t know how impactful it is. I’m not sure that people really care who endorses whom. I think ultimately, it comes down to the candidate. So the endorsement, I think, is hyped a lot more than it really is worth. But for me, I want to get to know him. I’m still doing that. We’re still discussing issues, but I fully expect to endorse the Republican nominee for governor… I’ve really enjoyed these conversations that we’ve had, and we’ve gone through a lot of the big issues that the governor has to face and that the people of Ohio have to face, and it’s a lot about.”
The governor continued with examples of challenges that the office has. On Thursday, he addressed why he hasn’t endorsed yet with a more direct answer.
“I want to get a better understanding of his positions, what his vision is,” he said.
However, DeWine said he has a sense of urgency, especially on making sure his priorities — literacy, mental health, support for children — are shown to work and are continued by the next administration.
“Will that be the next governor’s priority? I don’t know that… The burden of proof is on us to show that what we are doing is actually making a difference,” DeWine said.
And the governor also addressed Acton and the criticism she is facing now from Ramaswamy’s campaign for “shutting down” Ohio during the pandemic.
“The decisions about what to do were mine,” DeWine said. “Buck stops with the governor… Buck stops with me. I made the decisions.”
He continued that he thought he was getting advice from many different experts, and chose to act based on the best advice.
“I’m the responsible officer. I’m the responsible person in regard to those decisions,” DeWine said.
Trau: “Despite how you think that Jon Husted is doing in the Senate, do you regret appointing him because he will no longer be following in your footsteps of being governor?”
DeWine: “Now, I had two choices, two picks. I’m very lucky and fortunate that I had that opportunity, and the first one was to go to the United States Senate… I know how very important that job is. I know how important it is for Ohio to have someone that really understands the state. No one understands it better than Jon Husted. Jon has done a phenomenal job… My second pick… I’m very, very pleased with Jim Tressel… What I see day to day is even better than I could have imagined. This guy is a natural leader. He relates to people. He drills down on problems. He could be a success in any job that he ever would be in. He’s a phenomenal guy.”
Trau: “Were you disappointed when he decided not to run for governor?”
DeWine: “Well, look, he had to make that choice… I think very much surprised him and asked him if he would serve as lieutenant governor. I never once asked him, ‘Are you going to run?’ My ask was, ‘Will you serve as lieutenant governor? I think you’re the best person. If something happens to me, I would feel very comfortable with you walking in and being governor.'”
Trau: “Well, yeah, but we both know that you are strategic. Clearly, he has name recognition in the state. Clearly, people love him. And he would also continue your legacy. How much did that play into it?”
DeWine: “Well, I wanted someone who, if something happened to me, if I couldn’t serve, I died, could walk in and continue the work that we were doing… Look, he, independently, made that choice not to get involved in the race.”
Trau: “When you look back at the experience that you went through, are you concerned about two people who are coming into this race who have never held really an elected public office?”
DeWine: “Well, I think we’re seeing that more… Look, there is a learning curve for any job. I think the key for somebody who’s not been in public office before is they need to surround themselves with good people, and that’s no different than if you had 50 years’ experience as I have. You want good people; the people around you are very, very important, and my experience is you want people who are willing to tell you you’re wrong, or willing to point out to you the consequences of a certain action so that you then get the value of that input. You don’t want to be surrounded by people who tell you, ‘Yeah, you’re right all the time.”
He continued that a governor needs to know who they are and their values, but needs other people to help be the experts in specific areas.
Trau: “Is it bad for Ohio that there is really no primary?”
DeWine: “It is what it is. I’ve been in politics a long time, and I’ve been in many races, and most of the time, many times, I had a contest in the primary. I usually did. That’s sort of the norm, it would appear at least. And we haven’t hit the filing deadline yet, maybe somebody comes out and runs, but it appears that we pretty much now know who the Republican nominee is going to be and who the Democratic nominee is. That’s unusual. It is what it is, and people will have a choice. I think it’ll be a very interesting campaign.”
Trau: “Jon Husted has a pretty intense race coming up. He’s going up against Sherrod Brown, who you have obviously had familiarity with in a race.”
DeWine: “Yes, yes, Sherrod Brown beat me, so yes.”
Trau: “Are you worried?”
DeWine: “We look at Ohio and, and people are saying now it’s ‘Really a red state… It certainly is a state where a Democrat can win statewide. There’s no doubt about that.
“We don’t know what the political climate’s going to be a year from now or 10 months from now. So sure, everybody has to worry, and you have to always run very, very hard, but the one thing I know about Jon Husted — no one will outwork him. The guy’s a phenomenal worker. He knows how to raise money. He knows how to campaign. No one’s going to outraise money. No one’s going to outwork him. I think he’s a very attractive candidate, and he’s someone who cares passionately about the state, and I don’t know anybody who knows more about the state than Jon Husted does.”
Final thoughts
Trau: “Is your legacy at stake?”
DeWine: “Oh, I don’t think I should be worrying about a legacy. I don’t worry about a legacy. What I do worry about is I have 390-some days left and I wanna make the most of that and do the best that I can… There are just a lot of things that are a work in progress and I’ve got one year to try to get them done or at least put them in a solid place.”
Trau: “Are you a dying breed of Republican?”
DeWine: “Well, I don’t know if I’m a dying breed of Republican… I consider myself a Reagan Republican, and I think my basic principles have not changed. Do parties evolve? Yeah, they evolve. We only have two parties, so they have to evolve, and that’s what we’re seeing.”
Trau: “Anything else you want to add?”
DeWine: “Whoever the governor is, there’s nothing more important than our kids… We have an obligation to do everything we can so that a child can live up to his or her God-given potential. That, to me, is the most important thing any governor can do.”

(Stock photo by Greenleaf123/Getty Images)As political attacks on the nation’s courts intensify, a former Maine chief justice is joining dozens of his peers in a public effort to defend the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law.
Daniel E. Wathen, who previously headed the Maine Supreme Judicial Court and led the state commission that investigated the Lewiston mass shooting, is among more than 40 former state chief justices participating in the newly launched Alliance of Former Chief Justices, an initiative announced by the nonpartisan civic organization Keep Our Republic on Monday.
The launch coincided with Bill of Rights Day, celebrated annually on Dec. 15 to commemorate the ratification of the first ten amendments, which ensure various protections that rely on the court system for enforcement. 
In an open letter, the justices warned that conflating the judiciary with partisan politics threatens constitutional balance. Citing President James Madison’s warning that concentrating government power “may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny,” the former justices said that courts exist outside of partisan systems, but in the current moment have been the target of mounting political pressure, evident through increasing attacks on judges.
“I’m concerned about the state of our government and the respect and understanding of the importance of the rule of law,” Wathen said in an interview with Maine Morning Star. “It’s really under stress now like I’ve never seen in my lifetime.”
The letter emphasizes that judges cannot take political sides while keeping their oath to provide equal justice to all. 
Some people “with strong policy views” might resort to attacking judges in the hope of influencing their rulings or convincing the public that the judiciary is just another political branch, but “assertions that judges are mere politicians in robes … undermine the integrity of the rule of law and threaten the promise of equal justice,” the letter said.
In recent months, threats, violence and targeting of federal judges, some of whom have been directly criticized by President Donald Trump and members of his administration, have skyrocketed, according to data from the U.S. Marshals Service, the agency tasked with providing security to the federal judiciary. 
Several immigration judges in New York City have been fired by the administration, a Wisconsin judge was arrested by the FBI and is now facing trial, and  a judge in Rhode Island received death threats after blocking Trump’s freeze on federal aid.
Judges’ decisions may not always be received well, but there is an appeals process in place for challenging those, Wathen said.
“It’s not to call for the impeachment of the judge, and it’s not to call for violence against the judge,” he said.“But often in the world of today, violence is threatened or in few cases, it’s actually carried out.”
The declining respect for the judiciary and judges is predominantly still a federal issue, Wathen said, but it is a matter of time until it trickles down to the state level.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-1483489085-scaled-1-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-16 04:57:13.223487

(Jan Sonnenmair/Getty Images)Fred’s mother died from cancer. Her brother and sister did too, like their parents. Fred was in treatment; unsurprisingly, he inherited the cancer. Tragically, Fred died one week after his third radiation treatment. The police continue searching for the driver of the bus who, witnesses reported, ran a red light.
Those officers face a more difficult challenge than analysts attempting to explain the crisis that has torpedoed agricultural markets. President Trump and USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins eagerly blame farm country’s despair on the Biden economy. They must have flunked history, and the logic of causation. Everyone saw the bus: the Trump tariffs.
“This is a short-term solution. The president promised to have the back of every American farmer and rancher, and he knows the importance of keeping our rural economy strong.”
That wasn’t Rollins. That was former USDA secretary Sonny Perdue seven years ago, unveiling the first $12 billion Trump Trade War bailout. It ballooned to $28 billion in just one year.
“President Trump will not let our farmers be left behind, and it is imperative we do what it takes to help our farmers.” Rollins said while announcing the same amount Dec. 12.
Obviously a fan of the statute requiring preservation of official records and documents, she found it easier to copy than compose.
On cue, Kansas Republicans fell into line, cutting and pasting from the USDA cheerleading. Sen. Roger Marshall called the desperation of the bailout a “big win.” Rep. Tracey Mann proclaimed the dawn of a “golden age.”
Nobody foretold the 1973 Great Grain Robbery. Everybody should have anticipated the discrimination claims leading to the historic civil rights case Pigford v. Glickman. Only those who slept through the first Trump Administration’s trade war couldn’t predict Rollins’ rescue scheme. USDA’s historians — if any survive this administration’s disdain for history — will surely record it as the most stunning policy failure in department history.
It’s not just farmers who should want answers. Every taxpayer has 12 billion reasons to ask the same questions: How did this happen? What are the lessons?
Congress never debated this massive outlay, not holding a single hearing. Kansas Republican lawmakers acquiesced to — even supported — the blunders that prompted it. USDA could have sought public comment but didn’t. The Trump White House dumbfounds when proclaiming it’s “the most transparent administration in history.”
Lesson one: Failed oversight and executive opacity lead to out-of-control spending.
In the first Trump term, Perdue explained his rationale and methodology behind its amount. There was nothing to like about those tariffs and payments, but he did show his work.
Does the 2025 plan cost $12 billion because the 2018 plan did? That’s not an unreasonable conclusion, given that Rollins offered no explanation. The “most transparent administration” fails, again, at transparency.
Lesson two: Accountability and responsibility are essential to sound policy.
Rollins claims “the Trump administration has been working around the clock since January 20th to put American farmers first.” Her announcement included a list of items three times more verbose than the explanation of the compensation program itself.
The attempted rationalization fails: If the policies recited are working, or will, why the bailout?
“The last administration turned a trade surplus under Trump into a deficit,” she said. Actually, the agricultural trade balance went into deficit for the first time in 2019 and stayed negative in 2020. This year, according to her own department’s latest projections, the gap will be 45% higher than last year and the next year.
Nearly one year into office, Rollins still blames the sourness in farm country on the last administration. Why not? The president does the same. He calls “the affordability” a hoax and alleges Biden left a failing economy; in truth it was the world’s strongest. No doubt, if a sink overflows in the USDA women’s room on January 19, 2029, Rollins will pin it on Biden.
Contrary to what the president asserts, tariff revenues are not magically paying the tab for the bailout. The same taxpayer-funded internal USDA facility that has financed farm programs since the New Deal will finance this largess, as it did in 2018 and 2019.
The formula for the “reciprocal tariffs” — a specious concept — is nonsensical. It makes the bar napkin Laffer Curve seem scholarly. With little or no explanation, one day they’re up, then down, or the rationale is absurd: Trump is upset at a Brazilian judge or Canadian TV commercial. He gives more thought to building a ballroom and renovating golf courses.
Lesson three: Policy founded on untruths or deception, guided by mercurial, transactional intent, frequently fails.
USDA will not disburse the bailout until February. Already, some farm groups and farm farm lawmakers are calling for more. “While $12 billion is a lot of money, we very well need to issue more,” Sen. Jerry Moran said. Other Republicans have seconded his view.
Lesson four: Look both ways, another bus may be coming.

Ford",,,,,https://marylandmatters.org/2025/12/16/ron-watson-prince-georges-school-job/,"Maryland Sen. Ron Watson (D-Prince George’s) said Monday that he has resigned from a job as an adviser to the Prince George’s County school superintendent, amid ethical concerns.","Sen. Ron Watson (D-Prince George's) speaks with other attendees at the kickoff event for Del. Vanessa Atterbeary's campaign for Howard County executive on Oct. 15, 2025. (Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)Maryland Sen. Ron Watson (D-Prince George’s) said Monday that he has resigned from a job with the Prince George’s County school system, amid ethical concerns.
Under state ethics law, members of the General Assembly are generally not permitted to receive income from secondary jobs in state or local government because of the potential for conflicts of interest.
Watson asked that an exemption be made for his role as interim senior adviser to the Prince George’s superintendent of schools. But the Joint Committee on Legislative Ethics, which considers such requests, determined that state law prohibited Watson from holding the job, according to an Oct. 27 letter from the committee chairs, obtained by Maryland Matters.
Watson said Monday he resigned Dec. 1. He said he considered pursuing a legal challenge to the committee’s decision, but decided against it, saying “the juice wasn’t worth the squeeze.”
Prince George’s County Schools did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday. Watson was still listed on the school system’s website as an interim senior adviser to the president Monday afternoon, but that page had been taken down by Monday evening.
Watson said he assisted new Prince George’s County Interim Superintendent Shawn Joseph, who was appointed June 13 by County Executive Aisha Braveboy, giving him a just over two months to get ready for the Aug. 26 start of school in the county. Watson was appointed July 25.
“It was a great period of chaos and uncertainty,” said Watson, a former school board member in Prince George’s. “To be there with the superintendent and help guide him through this, as he was able to formulate his team and get these cabinets set up, I think was very valuable.”

In his role, Watson advised the superintendent on “policy, strategy, advocacy, and operational matters,” and designed and implemented the superintendent’s “priorities and initiatives,” according to the ethics committee letter.
Deadra Daly, the legislature’s ethics counsel, is not authorized to speak publicly about specific ethics cases, but said the committee generally expects a “prompt and quick response,” after a letter is issued to a lawmaker. Some time is allotted, however, for lawmakers to make any necessary changes.
“The committee recognizes that, as a member, you’ve got to weigh your options,” Daly said. “The committee usually asks the member: ‘Hey, you need to make a decision, and we’re going to follow up in a couple weeks.’ The committee is not going to say: ‘You got my letter today. Clean out your office in five minutes.’”
There are some exceptions in state law, allowing certain lawmakers to hold secondary jobs with state or local governments, Daly said. For example, lawmakers who held a government job before they filed for election are allowed to keep such positions.
Additionally, lawmakers may work as “a nonelected law enforcement officer or a fire or rescue squad worker” without needing approval from the ethics committee, according to the state ethics guide.
The committee can also grant exemptions for teaching positions, for “human services” positions such as social worker, and for positions that are subject to a standardized “merit system hiring process,” according to the ethics guide. The panel can also approve logical promotions or career changes for elected officials who held their government job before their election.
“A member should contact the Ethics Committee before accepting employment that requires an exemption,” reads the guide.
Daly said handling lawmakers’ secondary jobs is “always a balancing act.”
“We’re a citizen legislature, and we think that’s helpful because we think people have real-world experience they can apply, and we can get better work product,” Daly said.
But problems arise when legislators could benefit from holding a particular job and being a member of the General Assembly at the same time, Daly said.
“When we look at local governments, the General Assembly provides substantial funding, the General Assembly makes decisions on bills that would impact them,” Daly said. “There is that inherent tension, and those government entities are substantially reliant on the goodwill of the General Assembly.”

A fitting example? 
Try two chaotic, trade-busting Trump administrations that twice devastated America’s farm economy and twice required billions of dollars in taxpayer bailouts to farmers to fix this self-inflicted wound. 
The extraordinary farm aid packages: a total of $28 billion in Trump’s first term, another $12 billion (so far) in his second, are enormous amounts of money to compensate for making the same screwy tariff blunders and expecting different results. 
It’s insane.  
Sure, Ohio farmers welcomed the latest cache of what some call “Trump money” to get from this year to the next. But one told me it’s sad farmers have been backed into this corner. 
“What the Trump administration has done is left farmers with little choice but to come hat in hand to taxpayers for relief from the lost market share and sky-high input costs directly related to tariffs on steel, lumber, aluminum, repair parts and fertilizers farmers need to produce,” said Shelby County farmer Chris Gibbs. 
Another producer likened the temporary “bridge” payments, announced last week, to a Band-Aid on an open wound. 
Farmers trying to stay afloat with weak exports, falling crop prices and all-time-high production costs want sane agricultural policy not government handouts for failed trade and tariff policies coming out of the White House. 
“We can’t keep hoping these short-term payments are going to restore viability to Ohio agriculture and restore economic certainty to farmer farmers in the state,” said Bryn Bird, president of the Ohio Farmers Union. 
Bird, whose family has farmed produce for decades in Licking County, was adamant. 
“We need actual farm policy and agricultural policy and rural policy that’s going to create change. We are still operating on a 2018 farm bill that was pre-pandemic and have no indication from the federal government that they are working toward any bipartisan measure. We were told the administration might do a ‘skinny farm bill’ to address at least some farming concerns but that didn’t happen.”
Without significant changes enacted in an updated farm bill that finally addresses the mounting pressures on farmers, many won’t make it. 
Shouldering ever higher farming prices to produce bumper crops for reduced demand and negative profit is crushing Ohio family farmers already operating on tight margins. 
This year has been incredibly stressful for them, Bird said. They have much more to worry about than planting soybeans and selling them. 
Some, who need off-farm jobs to subsidize depressed farming incomes and have health insurance, can’t find affordable rural child care. 
Many self-employed farmers get their health care from the ACA marketplace, which is about to get a lot more expensive. 
Like millions of Americans, farmers running independent businesses brace for their premium costs to double or triple. 
ACA subsidies had lowered those costs but Republican majorities in Congress refused to extend them. 
Ohio farmers in their 60s who have not yet reached Medicare age are panicked, said Bird. 
“I just talked to a farmer whose insurance premiums were $220 a month and now they are going up to $1,200.00. He said to me, ‘I can’t do it.’”  
Farmers priced out of health insurance may go without, but they cannot go without the banks that underwrite their farms, and those annual operating loans are facing increased scrutiny and denials. 
With American farm debt projected to hit a record $591.8 billion in 2025, driven by serious input costs (fertilizer, fuel, machinery, labor) and devalued commodity markets, the risk of repayment grows from those with no runway to pay off their debts.
“The biggest thing I’m hearing now is how many farm loans are being denied,” Bird groaned. “Farm lenders are looking at turning away 40 to 60% of farm loans this coming year.” 
Most farmers typically take out operating loans at the start of growing season based on their projections, what they need to buy, seeds, inputs. When they grow and sell products, they pay off the operating loan and have their profit to reinvest in their farms or take home. 
At least that was the farm banking model, said Bird. But it didn’t account for the shambolic trade policies of two Trump administrations. 
Can banks manage that while holding hundreds of millions of dollars nationally in agricultural debt, she asked.
The central Ohio farmer recalled a Republican congressman from the state telling distressed farmers they “just have to wait, that the Trump tariffs were going to be good for family farmers. What the farmers were saying back was, can you tell my bank that?” said Bird. 
“Will you call the bank and tell them just to wait; these policies are going to pay my bills?” 
She fears more farm delinquencies and bankruptcies if short-term tariff bailouts replace long-term farm policy.   
“When we were on Capitol Hill this fall demanding a farm bill, the banks were with us because if agriculture defaults, banks default and once that happens things start to cascade.” 
Bird hopes the country doesn’t get to that point. 
But twice Trump blew up trade deals that devastated the U.S. farm economy and twice he had to bail out farmers for the pain he caused. 
Unless Congress finds a spine, Trump’s farm policy will continue to be, well, the definition of insanity.

Freeway expansion isn’t just a transportation issue; it’s one of the most overlooked drivers of California’s housing crisis. 
It didn’t arrive as a sudden catastrophe; it has been a slow erosion, a quiet form of displacement that has pushed thousands of families from their homes. And it isn’t just a legacy of the past; new projects planned across the state are continuing to displace families. 
In San Mateo, for instance, 33 families near the proposed Highway 101/92 expansion are facing forced removal from their homes. Versions of this pattern are unfolding across California: The California Department of Transportation, known as Caltrans, forces families from their homes to widen freeways, then it demolishes what remains. 
In other cases, the agency buys up neighborhoods for projects that stall or are canceled, leaving the community trapped in limbo. For many of the affected families, there is no real choice — only eminent domain, pressured buyouts or the slow dismantling of livable conditions. 
A stark example is the 710 freeway project in Los Angeles County. Caltrans displaced 460 families for a freeway that was never built, after decades of community opposition, environmental lawsuits and soaring costs. But the damage was done, suspending an entire community between displacement and decay. Caltrans has spent more than $17 million since 2020 just to guard the empty properties. 
“Because they never built the freeway… hundreds of properties fell into disrepair. A lot of them are blighted,” said Raymond Gutierrez, an architect and community advocate, “It feels like the neighborhood is a slum, but it’s not. These buildings could have been housing people.” 
His words reflect a harsh reality: state policy has repeatedly chosen freeways over people staying housed.

Recent state data shows that from 2018 to 2023, Caltrans demolished 623 homes and businesses to make way for 13 projects to expand freeways. The vast majority of the lost homes were in low-income communities of color, primarily in Los Angeles County.
New data from the state shows an additional 248 homes and businesses were demolished for freeway expansion in 2024, primarily in the Inland Empire region. 
And that’s only during a narrow window of time. Before 2018, California required no public reporting on displacement, but Los Angeles Times research has found that more than 10,000 families were displaced by freeway projects over the past 30 years. 
The lack of transparency is exactly why The Greenlining Institute created its Homes Before Highways interactive mapping tool, which brings data to life, showing where highway expansion has destroyed homes and businesses across California in recent years. 
Freeway expansion destabilizes entire communities. Tearing down homes shrinks the housing supply and limits affordable options for families.
Families displaced by freeway projects face soaring rents, fewer housing options and longer commutes to jobs and support networks. As residents are pushed farther from job centers, they’re forced to spend more on transportation, now the second highest expense after housing. 
Yet the justification for road expansion and displacement  — traffic relief — rarely materializes. The expansions don’t reduce traffic; they make it worse by inducing more driving. 
The Interstate 405 expansion, for example, cost $1.6 billion. Located in the western and southern reaches of the Los Angeles area, the project went wildly over budget and caused the demolition of 20 homes and three businesses. It also made traffic and commutes worse after completion. 
California has better, proven options. Investments in public transit, walking and biking infrastructure, and electric vehicles reduce transportation costs and take cars out of gridlock, without forcing families from their homes and dismantling communities. 
California’s elected leaders face an urgent and fundamental choice: They can continue spending billions on expansions that exacerbate the housing crisis but never deliver meaningful traffic relief; or they can invest in a transportation system that reflects values Californians champion: affordability and community wellbeing.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/022423-OAKLAND-I-980-MHN-02-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-16 08:56:24.760608
,California,2025-12-16 05:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,More adults return to college in California as inflation and job fears rise,Adam Echelman,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/higher-education/2025/12/california-community-college-enrollment-3/,"Some community college districts in California say enrollment is up by more than 10%, though official numbers have yet to be released. Historically, college enrollment fluctuates depending on the strength of the economy.","In summary
Some community college districts in California say enrollment is up by more than 10%, though official numbers have yet to be released. Historically, college enrollment fluctuates depending on the strength of the economy.


If you want to gauge the health of California’s economy, start with its community colleges. 
“When the economy is doing well, our enrollments are down, and when the economy is in a tough stretch or in a recession, we see our enrollments go up,” said Chris Ferguson, an executive vice chancellor with the California Community Colleges Chancellor’s Office, which oversees all of the state’s 116 community colleges. 
Ferguson said the state has yet to release authoritative data on fall enrollment, but early data shows upward trends. In interviews with CalMatters, some college presidents said they’re seeing over 10% more students compared to last fall. But they say the state hasn’t provided enough funding to keep up with their growth. 
California is not in a recession, but some economic indicators are grim. Unemployment is rising, and it’s getting harder to find a job. The cost of consumer goods, such as toilet paper and cosmetics, is going up, and economists say tariffs and President Donald Trump’s increased deportations could lead to further economic declines in the state. 
“Typically when the economy gets a little crazy, like it is right now, people need to upskill or find new work,” and workers look to colleges for help, said Nicole Albo-Lopez, deputy chancellor for the Los Angeles Community College District. In the Los Angeles district, students between the ages of 35 and 54 are coming back to school in droves — up 28% compared to last year, she said. 
Other factors may also be bringing students back to school. The COVID-19 pandemic created a sudden and historic drop in college enrollment, and some schools say the influx of students this year is just a return to pre-pandemic levels. A large portion of recent enrollment growth comes from high school students taking college courses, which has exploded in popularity in the past few years. 
But most college officials agree that uncertainty about the economy is at least one of the driving forces for new students this semester. 
At the Los Rios Community College District, which represents four campuses in the Sacramento metro area, enrollment is up by more than 5% compared to last fall. Part of that is due to “the gap between Wall Street and Main Street,” said Mario Rodriguez, an executive vice chancellor for the system: The stock market has performed well in the past few years, even as job seekers see fewer opportunities and families struggle with inflation. Enrollments in career technical classes are up 10% this semester at the district, the equivalent of almost 4,000 new students. 
These job-ready programs, such as medical assisting, welding, and automotive, have always been popular, and some cap enrollment. School officials say waitlists are growing.
Quitting a job, starting school
Carla Gruhn, 29, has worked as a medical assistant in San Jose for 10 years. At one point she was making roughly $50,000 a year, but it wasn’t enough.
“In the last year, eggs started becoming super expensive,” she said. “That’s when I started paying more attention to gas and groceries.” Together with her husband, she started planning ways to scale back — fewer coffee runs, less travel with their truck, cheaper gifts this Christmas. But they needed a long-term solution, too.
In July, she quit her job and enrolled in a two-year radiologic technology program at Foothill College, in the south Bay Area, which will teach her how to read X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs. Her salary will double, maybe even triple, once she graduates with the new credential. 
The pay raise could be “life-changing,” she said. At the moment, Gruhn said her family is small, just her husband and her dog, so their costs are lower, but they know it’s going to get more expensive, since they want to buy a house and have kids. “We’re trying to plan for the future too.”
At Foothill College, enrollment is up, especially in science and technology classes, said Simon Pennington, the school’s associate vice president of community relations. Many of these students are looking to fulfill prerequisites to enter careers in the health care sector, he added. Health care is one of the largest and fastest-growing job sectors in the state, according to a recent report from the Public Policy Institute of California. 
In Merced, hours away from major urban centers like the Bay Area, Sacramento, or Los Angeles, students are clamoring for classes in electronics, where the fall waitlist numbers have nearly doubled compared to three years ago. Demand is also up for classes in criminal justice and mechanized agriculture, according to James Leonard, a spokesperson for the school. 
“When the economy goes bad, enrollment skyrockets,” said Dee Sigismond, Merced College’s vice president of instruction, though she wasn’t certain that a recession would have the same impact it did 15 years ago. Staring during the pandemic, Merced College, like most community colleges, now offers many of its classes online, which can make it easier for students to juggle school with a full- or part-time job. She added that Merced is also experimenting with new, more flexible kinds of instruction, such as competency-based education, which allows students to pass a class by showing they already have the requisite skills.
Colleges call for more funding
California’s community colleges receive most of their funding based on the number of students they serve. When enrollment declined during the pandemic, colleges were set to lose funding, but the governor and the Legislature granted the community college system a special exemption, delaying many funding cuts. 
Now that enrollment is ticking up, many colleges say they have the opposite problem — they aren’t getting enough money to serve the influx of new students. That’s largely because the state’s funding formula is based on the college’s average enrollment over the past three years, so sudden changes this year are slow to have an effect. Rodriguez said his Sacramento area district is serving about 5,000 more students than the system is funded to support, representing about $20 million in lost revenue. 
This summer, the state agreed to send more money to California’s community colleges to account for recent enrollment growth, but Ferguson said it isn’t enough to fully fund all the new students. 
Last month, presidents and chancellors from 10 different community colleges or community college districts, including representatives from Los Angeles and Sacramento, sent a letter to the governor, asking him to change state policy and allow colleges to get more funding in next year’s budget. Though he did not sign the letter, Ferguson said the state chancellor’s office is asking the governor for similar changes. 
In 2008, colleges had to cut back on services or classes, even as new students poured in because the state didn’t provide proportionate funding for each new enrollment. 
Next year, California is expected to face an $18 billion budget deficit, according to a November analysis by the Legislative Analyst’s Office. For comparison, the state had a deficit of about $24 billion in 2008, worth about $36 billion in today’s dollars. 
In Chula Vista, Southwestern College President Mark Sanchez said his district is already saying no to potential college classes in high schools and prisons because of a lack of state funding. 
His district had over 32,000 students in the last academic year — the highest enrollment rate since the Great Recession.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/052424_Southwestern-College-Graduation_AH_CM_14.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-16 08:56:24.760608

But this is what I ask of you, gentle reader; we need to talk about a problem that would be facing us now even if The Donald had never been born.
The COP 30 climate talks have ended in Brazil, where they went the way they have since they started. There were hundreds of representatives in attendance to protect the interests of the fossil fuel companies, and the talks ended without managing a statement to the effect that we need to get off of greenhouse gases.
Imagine a global get-together of lung specialists happening in, say, 1971, convened in order to address cancer. Then imagine that this global get-together is also attended by hundreds or perhaps thousands of flacks for Philip Morris and big tobacco. A cohort like that might very well fail to agree to a statement simply connecting cigarettes and lung cancer, as the science clearly indicated. That would really have been a bust from a public health perspective, wouldn’t it?
Then imagine that scenario repeating itself year after year for decades on end while the death toll rises and the connection between smoking and lung cancer becomes increasingly obvious. Every year the pulmonologists get together with, among others, the tobacco industry, and every year they don’t manage to say “Smoking causes cancer.” At some point, you’d think the world would have had enough of that.
That’s how it is with these climate talks, but it’s worse. Perhaps because the body count was so high and the deaths so awful, or perhaps because the evidence came in before the current era of denying scientific truth, the fact that smoking cigarettes is bad for you is not a well-kept secret and is not denied in public. In most places (and certainly in the U.S.), rates of smoking have declined. 
Greenhouse emissions, on the other hand, have never gone down year-to-year during the 30 years of COP extravaganzas, except once during covid. Yes, a worldwide pandemic can put a dent in emissions. A global pompfest, not so much. All of the talking has, in effect, given cover for business as usual throughout the COP era. 
Global warming is something that we experience personally, but it isn’t like losing a  loved one to cancer. Flatly denying the fact of it remains, somehow, an option. Trump does it; Trumpers do it. In my book, COP 30 and all of those confabs have done it too. Our greenhouse gases are cooking the earth and we need to stop: if you won’t say that, you’re in denial.
So: the global invite-everybody-in-and-talk-about-it strategy has utterly failed. What is to be done?
At the other end of the spectrum, there are the not-at-all global actions that we can take as individuals. Things like turning lights off in empty rooms and insulating your dwelling are definitely not going to save the world, but they’ll help – in part, as a statement. 
People say “Why should I bother about my own little life? It won’t make a difference; we need big systemic change.” The big systemic change doesn’t happen, and we’re cooking the earth on three burners at once. Some get sort of huffy about it: “Don’t be putting this on me. I didn’t put us where we are.” Mostly, nobody in particular did. But suppose we name and shame the oil/gas/coal CEOs, their henchpersons and the pols who take their money and do their bidding? Then we note that we aren’t them, but what does it buy us? If it buys you a clear conscience so you can go to the grocery store and pick up the dry cleaning in a vehicle that gets 14 miles to the gallon, you’re part of the problem. No, not as big a part as Chevron. But part of the problem, not part of the solution.    
This sort of thing goes on at the national level as well. Why should we restrain our emissions if India doesn’t? Why should India if China doesn’t? Why should anybody until everybody does? If you’re interested in helping solve the problem rather than in rationalizing your continuing contribution thereto, the answer is simple: because (see COP 30 and its cousins by the dozens) everybody never will. 
Between the extremities of  the individual conserving energy at home and the whole world getting together to do nothing, there are millions of economic units — families, companies, towns, states, countries– that either do something about climate change or somehow justify doing little or nothing. Like it or lump it, these non-global entities are where the crisis will be faced or not faced. Any or all of them can always say “Not my fault” or “Not until so-and-so does it first,” but as a first step against excuse-making, I suggest we abolish the COP meetings. They are not having the desired effect, but they make it easier for people to not do anything real, anything small or medium-sized and doable, by giving the impression that big things are underway elsewhere. They aren’t. 
Those of the intermediate economic entities that do decide to do something about global warming should look at the useless COP talks and remember that the more people and entities you get involved, the wider a net you cast, the more difficult it will become to agree to anything. It’s great to scale things up, but once you’ve included everybody, you have included people and entities that want you to fail. 
I will end as I began, with Trump. He said he wasn’t sending a delegation to this year’s climate conference because global warming is a hoax. As so often, he has it exactly upside-down. Global warming is a very real threat to all of us; it’s the talks that are a hoax.

But then came the cotton candy vapes. 
They were, and still are, everywhere you look. Back in middle and high school, I remember friends had them in their backpacks and hoodie sleeves, they even used them in the school bathrooms. 
This past summer, I witnessed firsthand the real impact it has had. My friends and I took a girls’ trip, and one day, we decided we wanted to blow up a pool floatie. Given that we didn’t have an air pump, the only option was to do it manually. One of my friends, who has vaped regularly for years, couldn’t get more than three breaths in before giving up. She began coughing and ran out of breath. It was funny for a second…until it wasn’t. 



This was the moment that made me realize how this epidemic is hurting the people closest to us. 
When e-cigarettes first hit the market, companies claimed that they were safer than smoking real cigarettes and that they would help adults quit smoking, when in reality, they’ve only really done the opposite for young people. Vaping may look harmless because of the fun flavors, names, and colors on the packaging, but the reality of it is way darker. E-cigarette use can lead to cardiovascular disease, neurological disorders, and even long term damage to the airways that can make something as simple as inhaling a serious struggle. These devices push harmful chemicals deep into young people’s lungs, disrupting their bodies in ways they’re not even aware of until it’s too late. 
A Yale-led study found that one in four Connecticut high school students and one in 30 middle schoolers had already tried vaping. This may not seem like much at first glance, but the fact of the matter is that a vast majority of adolescents know at least one peer who vapes, at the very minimum. A large portion of the teens from the study preferred sweet and fruity flavors, and many students who had never smoked cigarettes before began experimenting with nicotine through vapes, which demonstrates that flavored e-cigarettes are a gateway, not a solution.

 The problem is not just about curiosity. The brain is not finished developing until about age 25. This time is critical in the development of areas like attention, memory, and decision making. The CDC mentions that nicotine exposure during these earlier years of development can impair brain chemistry, having outcomes that linger into adulthood. 
Despite this, vape companies continue to sell what seems like nicotine candy to minors, disguised in bright packaging and flavors like “blue razz” or “mango blast.” When you think about it, it makes sense that as soon as companies began seeing a decline in sales, they had to figure out a way to create new products that were trendy, tasted good, and addictive. 
Our neighboring states, such as New York, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island, have already taken action to address this issue. Massachusetts, for example, passed its 2019 Tobacco Control Law, which banned all flavored nicotine and tobacco products. These states were able to recognize the problem for what it is, a public health emergency. How is it that states just hours away have taken initiative to protect their youth, and Connecticut still hasn’t banned the very flavors that helped hook an entire generation? 
While nothing in CT has become law yet, lawmakers have tried. Senate Bill 326, An Act Concerning Flavored Tobacco Products, was designed precisely to restrict the sale of flavored nicotine and vaping products across the state of Connecticut, however, it did not pass. As a result, flavored vapes remain widely available and attractive to younger audiences.
It’s time for that to change. Connecticut should revive, strengthen, and reconsider SB 326 to create a statewide law to ban flavored vapes, mirroring our neighboring states. The law should eliminate all non-tobacco flavors from retail shelves and increase penalties for selling to minors. Taking this step towards better health and a future for our youth would do more than just reduce teen vaping rates, it would also send a clear message that the health and safety of our children are valued and prioritized over the profits of the tobacco industry.
When I think back to that summer afternoon, watching my friend struggle to breathe, I can’t help but feel how preventable it all is. Our generation came so close to ending teen smoking, we never would’ve thought that nicotine would come back disguised as a fruit flavored cloud. If Connecticut wants to protect its minors, it’s time to clear the air once and for all.

(Photo by txking via Getty Images)The Maryland Public Defender’s Office is forming a new partnership to transform the state’s criminal justice system by implementing recommendations of another collaborative that was dissolved less than a month ago.
The Maryland Justice Partnership is schedule to launch on Jan. 12, just two days before the start of the 2026 General Assembly, to follow up on the work of the Maryland Equitable Justice Collaborative. That body, a historic joint effort of the public defender and the Maryland Attorney General’s Office, dissolved Nov. 26 after two years of work.
The main goal of that collaborative was to deliver recommendations on ending mass incarceration in a state where Blacks account for about 30% of the state’s population, but make up about 71% of the state’s prison population. It was disbanded after delivering a 100-page report in March that included statistics on disparities and recommended solutions.
At the time, the collaborative’s supporters said its work would continue. The new parthership’s goal is to come up with a plan to create solutions based on the collaborative’s recommendations.
Heather Warnken, executive director of the Center for Criminal Justice Reform at the University of Baltimore School of Law, said Monday she will be part of the partnership. Warnken served as co-chair of one work group on the justice collaborative and a member of three other work groups.
Attorney general, public defender dissolve historic ‘equitable justice’ collaborative

“The fact that this new vehicle will exist to focus on continuing … the partnerships needed not only to advance the recommendations but really be into the weeds into a collaborative way on what it takes to implement them effectively,” Warnken said. “Public safety exists in so many different forums. It takes so many different partners to each have a distinct role to play.”
Similar to the collaborative, the justice partnership seeks to involve other stakeholders, such as state agencies, nonprofit organizations and community leaders as part of the reform initiatives. Participation in the justice partnership is voluntary.
The public defender’s office, which announced the formation of its partnership last Tuesday, plans to incorporate six hubs:

Community safety and crisis response;
Pretrial justice and diversion;
Behavioral health justice;
Fair sentencing and parole reform;
Community reintegration and stability; and
Youth justice and educational equity.

The office says this initiative will serve differently from the collaborative to not only focus on implementing solutions, but also allowing “impacted communities” to lead alongside state agencies.
One of those individuals who wants to serve in the justice partnership is Gordon Pack, who was a member of the collaborative’s prison, jail and detention facility reform work group. Pack, who served 42 years in prison for various crimes he committed at age 15, said Monday he would like to work on dealing with ways to improve parole and probation.
“It gives us a space to continue the work that needs to be done,” he said.
One main theme the public defender’s office and advocates continue to push is stopping the state’s practice of automatically charging youth as adults.
That will translate into legislation for next year’s session expected to be filed again by Sen. William C. Smith Jr. (D-Montgomery), the chair of the Judicial Proceedings Committee.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Smith will reintroduce his bill, which didn’t advance beyond a Senate committee in 2025. It would have raised the age at which a youth could be tried as an adult, from 14 to 16. It also would have made those 16 and younger eligible for juvenile court if charged with certain crimes, including first-degree assault, third-degree sex offense and certain offenses involving firearms.

It was home to the U.S. capital during the ratification of the treaty that officially ended the Revolutionary War. Maryland enacted the first American religious freedom law and built the nation’s first railroad. And in 2020, Maryland became the most diverse state on the East Coast and home to the three most diverse cities in the country.
The Free State took enormous strides this century towards becoming a truly inclusive, multiracial democracy. Maryland is now the state with the fourth-highest percentage of Black residents and, just last year, elected its first Black U.S. senator. But despite all this, Marylanders continue to face discrimination at the ballot box, making a Maryland Voting Rights Act even more critical.
Maryland has the second-highest share of eligible Black voters in the country, but the racial turnout gap between Black and white Maryland voters nearly doubled between 2020 and 2022. In the 2024 general election, turnout among both Black and white Maryland voters increased, but the severe turnout gap persists. Even when voters of color are politically engaged, restrictive voting laws can heavily deter voters from reaching the polls in the first place.
The MDVRA is critical to ensuring all voters, especially Black voters who have historically faced barriers, can cast meaningful ballots and fully participate in Maryland’s democratic process. Maryland voters face serious obstacles, not only at the state level but also from increasing federal attacks on voting rights and the foundational protections of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA).

The VRA has become a terribly shredded shield — suffering blow after blow as regressive legislatures and a malicious executive branch attempt to overturn every single step forward that the Civil Rights Movement took for our country.
Make no mistake: the VRA is under attack every single day.
Recent court decisions on the VRA’s protections for coalition districts, the ability to use the VRA to directly fight discrimination, and voters’ ability to bring lawsuits based on disability assistance at the polls have further eroded protections for Americans.
We’ve even seen attacks at the federal level just this year on voter registration norms and on mail-in voting — attacks designed to silence voters, especially voters of color, young voters and working-class Americans.
When our right to vote is diminished, our democracy is weakened. When our democracy weakens, voters lose their ability to advocate for better schools, clean water, paved roads, job opportunities, health care access and a whole host of other issues that directly impact their lives.
Maryland must make fair voting access and voter protection a priority. Voters have consistently demonstrated that they want legislators to take these threats seriously and do everything in their power to protect Maryland voters from those who wish to set us back decades in electoral practices.
The MDVRA will be a crucial tool against racial vote dilution, which happens when election systems deny voters of color an equal opportunity to elect candidates of their choice. And when you don’t have the full power of your vote, you don’t have the full power to effect change in your community.
The MDVRA provides tools to identify and eliminate vote dilution, while ensuring that local officials receive the critical support they need to fix discriminatory issues voters have historically faced at the ballot box. And the MDVRA will save everyone taxpayer dollars by preemptively avoiding costly litigation.
The MDVRA would give Maryland the power to protect its voters, regardless of how the Supreme Court pushes federal law. In the wake of the pending Louisiana v. Callais decision, the MDVRA might be all that’s left to protect Marylanders should the decision strike down the ability of voters to challenge discriminatory voting practices in court.
Maryland has made great progress in building an inclusive democracy in recent years, passing strong requirements from the MDVRA to provide language assistance in elections during the 2025 legislative session.
But we must do more and finish the job by 2026. Our current protections will not be enough to win every battle for equal voting rights, especially the ones being waged by the current administration. Passing the rest of the MDVRA, including protections against vote dilution, voter suppression, and voter intimidation, must be priority number one for the 2026 legislative session.
Now is the time for Maryland to lead the way in safeguarding voting rights.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Voters-at-Wayne-K.-Curry-Sports-and-Learning-Complex-10-31-2024-1024x631.jpg,,,2025-12-15 23:57:39.550070

(Courtesy photo by the Alaska National Guard)The State of Alaska and the Federal Emergency Management Agency have extended their deadlines to apply for individual disaster assistance for those impacted by storms in Western Alaska, including Typhoon Halong. 	

How to apply for State of Alaska or FEMA individual assistance:

Online
Call the Alaska Call Center at 1-866-342-1699
Or visit an assistance hub set up in Bethel through Dec. 19. 



State and federal officials are continuing to encourage residents to register for both state and federal assistance programs to maximize their potential benefits. The new deadline for applications is February 20, 2026. 
“We know that there may be more people out there, and we want to give them this opportunity to register,” said Jeremy Zidek, a spokesperson for the Alaska Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management.
Zidek urged residents to apply for both assistance programs if they have experienced any level of storm damage. He said registrations can be updated once they have been filed. 
“We always say that if people are unsure about their damages or unsure if they want to apply, to just go ahead and apply,” he said. “They can always amend their application at a later date. But after those deadlines, it becomes very difficult for us to register people, so we really urge anyone that had damage, even if it was a little bit of damage, to apply and go through the process.”
The state has received 1,920 aid applications and FEMA has received 1,630 applications for assistance as of Dec. 10. The programs provide relief for damage to homes, damage to essential personal property and medical, dental or funeral needs directly related to the disaster. State disaster aid also includes assistance for damage to subsistence camps. The Small Business Administration is also providing low-interest loans, including up to $100,000 for repairs to subsistence camps. 
The state and FEMA have distributed over $41 million in disaster assistance as of Nov. 25, and have visited 43 communities. 
An estimated 1,160 residents evacuated from Western Alaska following Typhoon Halong, with dozens of communities sustaining damage across the region. 
Since the evacuations, 678 residents have been staying in hotels in Anchorage. The first group of families began moving into longer term housing last week, according to a state update. The state’s emergency management division is working with local property owners and non-profit partners to locate apartments and housing units throughout Anchorage for long-term housing for storm displaced residents. 
Officials also set a Dec. 15 deadline for owners to claim pets. Over 200 dogs were evacuated from Western Alaska after the storms, and 21 dogs remain unclaimed. Pet owners who have not yet claimed their dogs  can search for them at a website created by volunteers.



Federal disaster areas include:

Echoing state and local officials, a new analysis agrees: hydrant failures in the Palisades fire were ‘the rule rather than the exception.’ 


As firefighters battled catastrophic fires in Los Angeles last January, one question reverberated across the country: Where was the water?  
The question came from wealthy developer Rick Caruso and then-President-elect Donald Trump, from reporters and residents. It prompted executive orders and state and federal investigations. Once the fires were more ash than flame, the Trump administration used a water shortage to justify its baffling move to release vital summer irrigation supplies from two reservoirs that do not supply Los Angeles.  
“I will demand that this incompetent governor allow beautiful, clean, fresh water to FLOW INTO CALIFORNIA!” Trump posted on social media, referencing Gov. Gavin Newsom, as the fires raged across L.A. “On top of it all, no water for fire hydrants, not (sic) firefighting planes. A true disaster!” 
A team of researchers, led by Gregory Pierce, director of the UCLA Water Resources Group, set out to uncover whether the intense focus on water supply meant that dry hydrants had uniquely hampered the Palisades firefight, or whether this was a common occurrence. 
In a policy brief published Monday, the researchers used media reports to confirm that when fires burn urban areas, hydrant flows often sputter out — the result of lost pressure as burnt homes hemorrhage water and too many hoses simultaneously draw on a limited supply.
“Fire hydrant performance in the Palisades seems to represent the rule rather than the exception,” the report says. “The only apparent, factual difference between the Palisades Fire and its comparators is that hydrant performance did not make the headlines of news stories covering the other fires.” 
‘The rule rather than the exception’
The policy brief echoes the findings of a recent state investigation into water supply during the Palisades Fire. 
“Even though there was plenty of water available in the system,” state investigators wrote, “it was not possible to pump enough water to the fire area all at once to meet the flow rate demand created by the leaking water from already destroyed structures and high water use from hydrants.” 
Even if the much-implicated empty Santa Ynez reservoir had been full, “the hydrants could not have maintained pressure,” the state report said.

Together, the Eaton and Palisades fires destroyed thousands of structures, caused tens of billions of dollars in damage, killed at least 31 people and likely contributed to hundreds more deaths. 
With smoke still in the air, experts, state officials, reporters and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power raced to fact-check claims that water management resulting in dry hydrants was uniquely responsible for the devastation. The repeated refrain: urban water systems aren’t built to put out wildfires.
But the spark had caught. And as residents reeled from the devastating losses of entire communities and grasped for explanations, a sense of betrayal — that water and their hydrants had failed to save Los Angeles from the flames — set in. 
By the end of March, nearly a third of 2,000 Los Angeles County residents surveyed by the USC Dornsife Center for Economic and Social Research blamed poor water management as the biggest contributor to the wildfires. Only slightly more — 36% — said arson.  
Another survey by Probolsky Research reported that more than a quarter of 1,000 likely primary election voters in California were surprised to hear — or flat out didn’t believe — that fire hydrants are not designed to fight major wildfires. 
“Sometimes all you need is one idea to catch on a little bit and start spreading. And then once it starts to go viral, it gets accepted by lots of people,” said Lisa Fazio, an associate professor of psychology and human development at Vanderbilt University who studies how people learn information. 
During disasters, she said, “people are hunting for that understanding and sense of control.” 
It’s happened before — many times. 
In fire after fire, the researchers found reports of lost water pressure.
Paul Lowenthal, division chief fire marshal with the Santa Rosa Fire Department, remembers when the Tubbs Fire roared through Santa Rosa in 2017, destroying thousands of homes and killing 22 people. 
“When we had the loss of pressure in Fountaingrove, there was this immediate sense of, ‘The firefighters didn’t have the water that they needed to fight the fire,’” he said. “And I think we saw some of the same concerns bubble up out of Los Angeles.” 
But Lowenthal said the true picture was much more complicated: In the hills, as the fire was pushing into the city, firefighters were too busy getting people out to even use the hydrants. 
“It was all just purely saving lives,” he said. By the time the winds had died down on the valley floor enough to fight back the flames, he said, the city’s water system had restored enough pressure to hydrants. 
Kevin Phillips, district manager of Paradise Irrigation District, said that some hydrants in the town of Paradise lost pressure during the 2018 Camp Fire, which remains the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California history. 
When a wildfire destroys a town, like the fires in Paradise or the Palisades, Phillips said, each burned home bleeds water out of the system — sapping its pressure. 
“Every one of those homes that gets burned is an open sore to the outside,” Phillips said. “Your system basically is dying as every one of those homes are being destroyed.” 
William Sapeta, fire chief of the Lake County Fire Protection District, agreed. “The Eaton and the Palisades fires really drew a lot of attention to the capabilities of water for fire suppression,” he said. “Yet we experienced in the Camp Fire, the Valley Fire, the Carr Fire — all of these fires have exceeded municipalities’ ability to provide water for fire suppression.” 
New requirements
Hydrants and water supply have drawn public scrutiny in Ventura County, where two major wildfires in less than a decade spurred reports of hydrant outages and lost water pressure. 
The fires in Assemblymember Steve Bennett’s home county, one of which burned homes on his own street, prompted new legislation. Signed into law this year, Bennett’s bill sets new requirements for certain water suppliers in fire-prone parts of Ventura County to harden their systems and obtain enough backup power or alternate water supplies to keep water pumps running for 24 hours. 
“You ought to be able to have a system that can at least help you put out the small little ember, the bush that catches on fire — so that you can get it before the house catches on fire,” the Democrat from Oxnard said. Having enough to do that, he added, should be the minimum requirement. 
But some water suppliers fear they won’t be able to withstand the financial costs of meeting the law’s requirements, and worry about the potential liability if they can’t. 
“You have smaller water systems that don’t even have the capacity or funding to deal with all those things,” said Daryl Osby, former Los Angeles County Fire Department chief and now vice president of emergency preparedness, safety & security for California Water Service, an investor-owned water utility.  
A new frontier
ASU’s Faith Kearns, a co-author of the policy brief, has chronicled the convergence of fire and water supplies before, and said the growing scale and devastation of these fires are resetting public expectations for urban water systems.
“This feels like the new frontier we’re discussing around wildfire, but (it’s) just part and parcel of California’s really complex, ongoing wildfire issues,” Kearns said. 
Climate change-fueled, extreme conditions further limit what water and water systems are capable of in response to fire — like in Santa Rosa, where Lowenthal said firefighters were too focused on saving lives to tap the hydrants in the hills. 
“You might have the best water system in the world, and you still might not have conditions that are safe for fire personnel to go into,” Kearns said. 
The new UCLA policy brief doesn’t interrogate why the hydrants became such a flashpoint in the Palisades Fire, but Pierce has some hypotheses. Preliminary data for a forthcoming study suggests it’s political — that support for Trump drives the belief that water management was to blame for the fires. 
“Local influencers, political voices — all the way up to the president and a lot of people in between — quickly seized on the fact that some of the fire hydrants in the Palisades Fire didn’t have water,” Pierce said. 
That gained a snowball effect. “The same thing kept getting repeated, and then people just thought it was true.” 
Fazio, the psychology professor at Vanderbilt not involved in the policy brief, said the urge to cling to a culprit may even go deeper: people often seek out simple answers in moments of crisis. 
“You could think of all of this as being a part of a causal story — like, ‘What caused my house to burn down? Why was it not safe?’” Fazio said. “The really simple model is, ‘The firefighters and the hydrants are supposed to prevent it, and they didn’t, therefore they’re at fault.’ Whereas I’m sure the actual causal story is much more complicated.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/010725_Pacific-Palisades-Fire_GETTY_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-15 21:57:59.045184

(Grant Stringer/States Newsroom)A group of Washington and Oregon lawmakers gathered Monday, expecting to hear a new estimate of the cost to replace the Interstate 5 bridge across the Columbia River.
When it didn’t come, some on the bi-state and bipartisan committee assigned to keep tabs on the megaproject rebuked planners responsible for delivering the updated figures. Lawmakers are wrestling with budget challenges in both states, they said, and escalating costs might need addressing in their respective 2026 sessions.
“I want a date, and I want a report, or else I would say that your team is not doing its work,” said Oregon state Rep. Thủy Trần, D-Portland. “You can’t punt it down the road without giving us something.”
Washington state Rep. John Ley, R-Vancouver, said he was “extremely disappointed” because if costs are rising, the two states may be asked to give additional money. Lawmakers need time to explore ways to trim the project to something “closer to our taxpayers ability to pay,” he said.
Project planners acknowledged they didn’t deliver. They said they are waiting to learn if the U.S. Coast Guard will allow the design of the new bridge to be the fixed span desired by the two states or require a movable span like the existing bridge. 
A movable span will add more than a half-billion dollars to the project’s price tag. 
That decision is critical to an “accurate and comprehensive cost estimate,” said Carley Francis, southwest regional administrator for the Washington State Department of Transportation and the incoming interim director of the Interstate Bridge Replacement Program.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Project planners had estimated the price tag for replacing the bridge would range from $5 billion to $7.5 billion, with a likely figure of around $6 billion. Construction costs have soared by 30% or more on transportation projects in the Seattle and Portland regions in recent years.
There’s no sign the trend will reverse. It’s why lawmakers in September said they anticipated the next cost estimate will exceed $8 billion and could reach $10 billion.
While Francis detailed the process for calculating an estimate, she veered away from positing any numbers Monday. She made clear multiple times it won’t be done until they know what kind of bridge it will be.
“I do not have a specific time frame for you today because the Coast Guard decision is so material,” she said. 
‘Tremendously tough project’
2026 is shaping as a year of critical decisions for the project.
First up, is the U.S. Coast Guard’s determination. 
Three years ago, the federal entity embraced a movable span but gave the two states time to put forth an argument for a fixed span. Last month, project planners submitted a report responding to the Coast Guard’s arguments that included agreements to offset impacts to those businesses that cannot travel under a fixed span.
Also early next year, the Federal Highway Administration and Federal Transit Administration are expected to publish the final supplemental environmental impact statement for the project. But it cannot be finished until the bridge configuration is known.
Once the bridge design is set, staff said they can update the cost estimate and complete a separate plan showing how the multi-year undertaking will be financed.
That financial plan is due to the federal government by the end of next September and is needed to unlock a $1.5 billion capital investment grant secured last year. Missing the deadline puts those dollars at risk, although program staff said they’d seek an extension if they are waiting on a bridge design decision and environmental report.
If required approvals are in hand in 2026, as planners anticipate, cars could begin driving across a new bridge in 2032 or 2033.
It’s a “tremendously tough project,” said outgoing program administrator Greg Johnson. 
“The biggest hedge we have against escalation and inflation is getting started, getting shovels in the ground,” he added.
Questions abound
Lawmakers weren’t alone in their pique at the lack of new projected price tag.
“Tragically today you have failed to get the most important information about this project: How much it will cost,” said Joe Cortright, director of City Observatory in Portland, a think tank focusing on urban economic issues. “They really know the cost estimate will be much higher but they are not sharing it with you.”
Chris Smith of Just Crossing Alliance, which advocates for light rail and transit on the future bridge, said the delay in producing numbers is part of a “nakedly political process to avoid delivering bad news.”
Laurie Layne of Buckley, a small town in Washington’s Pierce County, urged lawmakers to remember that many residents of the two states cannot afford to pay more.
“A lot of us taxpayers are on hamburger helper budgets,” she said.
Cost estimate and bridge design were not the only outstanding matters flagged Monday. 
Oregon Rep. Shelly Boshart Davis, R-Albany, said it’s problematic that administrators know how bicyclists and pedestrians will be served but haven’t decided on how many auxiliary lanes there will be on the bridge, calling it a top concern for the freight industry.
Johnson said a decision on whether the bridge will include one or two auxiliary lanes in each direction will be made next year in the final supplemental environmental impact statement.

About 200 people gathered in freezing temperatures Monday evening to celebrate the Jewish Festival of Lights, a day after authorities say a father and son opened fire during a Hanukkah celebration at Sydney’s famous Bondi Beach, killing 15 people.

“Our hearts are broken for the families who lost loved ones, for all those injured,” Rabbi Hesh Epstein of Chabad of South Carolina said in opening the hour-long ceremony. ”We join our brothers and sisters in Sydney in grief and prayer and unwavering solidarity.”
Those killed were between 10 and 87 years old, The Associated Press reported. At least 42 others were being treated at hospitals on Monday morning, several in critical condition.
Australian authorities have yet to officially name the victims. Police fatally shot one of the gunmen, a 50-year-old man. The other shooter, the man’s 24-year-old son, was wounded and treated at a hospital, according to the AP.
Survivors shared stories of people running, screaming, hiding under tables and blankets. Videos captured the sound of gunfire for at least 7 minutes.
The massacre was Australia’s deadliest shooting in three decades.
A 1996 shooting in the Tasmanian town of Port Arthur, where a lone gunman killed 35 people, prompted the government to pass strict gun laws, making mass shootings rare in the country.

The shooting also marks the single deadliest attack on the Jewish community since Hamas militants launched a surprise attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. About 1,200 civilians were killed in Israel and Hamas took some 250 hostages.
As part of a U.S.-brokered ceasefire agreement, the Trump administration in October secured the release of 48 hostages, both living and deceased, who had remained in Hamas custody for about two years. Since Oct. 13, Hamas has released all but one of the deceased hostages, according to the American Jewish Committee.
“Hanukkah was never meant to be celebrated only when the world feels safe and calm. In fact, Hanukkah was born in uncertain times like this,” Epstein reminded those gathered at the Statehouse. “We cannot — we will not — allow the darkness of terrorism to extinguish the light of our celebration.”
Children from the Cutler Jewish Day School in Columbia sang songs and shared lessons with the South Carolina crowd.

“This is not just a ceremony; this is a statement,” said Jessie Dowsakul, executive director of the Columbia Jewish Federation. “As Jewish communities around the world gather to celebrate Hanukkah, we do so carrying a heavy truth. Antisemitism is rising, openly, aggressively, and without apology. Jewish communities are being targeted simply for existing. Moments meant for joy, worship, and togetherness are being interrupted by hate.”
“Not today. Not on Hanukkah. Not any day. There is no place for antisemitism here,” Dowaskul added. “Not in our institutions, not in our communities and not in our state.”
To close out the ceremony, college students from the University of South Carolina chapter of Chabad climbed the ladder to light the candles signifying the first two nights of Hanukkah.
“Each one of us is a light. Hanukkah reminds us to use our light and share it with others,” Rabbi Alicia Rothamel of Columbia’s Beth Shalom Synagogue told the crowd. “This past Sunday we were reminded yet again that there are some in this world who wish to extinguish that light. So, I am incredibly grateful and overwhelmed with joy to see all of us here tonight.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC_0442-scaled-e1765847452621-1024x662.jpg,,,2025-12-15 20:56:32.427283

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)The Wisconsin Supreme Court declined Monday to throw out Wisconsin’s religious exemption from the state’s unemployment insurance system and affirmed that Catholic Charities organizations in Wisconsin are exempt.
The state’s highest court acted in response to the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in June reversing the Wisconsin Court’s decision in 2024, which found the organizations didn’t qualify for the state law’s UI religious exemption.
Monday’s unsigned order made no statements for or against any of the numerous briefs that were filed with the Wisconsin Court after the Supreme Court ruling.
In a 4-3 ruling in March 2024, the Wisconsin Supreme Court held that Catholic Charities’ work was secular rather than religious, and that the organization therefore was not entitled to an exemption in Wisconsin’s unemployment insurance law.
The religious exemption is reserved for employees of churches, their parent organizations, employees of organizations “operated primarily for religious purposes” and controlled by churches or church associations, church ministers or members of a religious order.
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled unanimously June 5, 2025, that the Wisconsin Court’s ruling “grants a denominational preference by explicitly differentiating between religions based on theological practices” and therefore violated the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution’s religious freedom provision.
After that ruling, both Catholic Charities and the Wisconsin Department of Justice filed proposed remedies with the Wisconsin Court. The Wisconsin DOJ called on the court to throw out the state law’s religious exemption to restore “equal treatment.”
Catholic Charities rejected that proposal, declaring it showed “animus” toward the charity, and urged the court instead to affirm the exemption.
In the decision Monday, the Wisconsin Supreme Court sent the case back to Douglas County Circuit Court. The order directs the lower court to vacate earlier Labor and Industry Review Commission decisions denying the religious exemption and to direct LIRC to declare Catholic Charities “eligible for the religious purposes exemption to unemployment taxation.”
Victor Forberger, a Wisconsin unemployment lawyer who has written about the case on his blog, told the Wisconsin Examiner that the state high court’s action Monday was not a surprise in light of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling.
The federal ruling, however, did not address calls by outside groups seeking a more sweeping religious exemption, Forberger said. “How this is going to play out with other entities and their claim for religious exemptions are all to be determined,” he added.

In an email, a PSC spokesperson said one error was requesting the investigation itself because it wasn’t within the language of what commissioners actually approved. [[...]","Colstrip Power Plant (Photo by Darrell Ehrlick of the Daily Montanan).Just two weeks after it called for a federal investigation of NorthWestern Energy, the Montana Public Service Commission said it made “significant errors” in its filing and it reversed course.
In an email, a PSC spokesperson said one error was requesting the investigation itself because it wasn’t within the language of what commissioners actually approved.
The Public Service Commission had originally called on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to investigate the utility for attempting to evade the law with its plan to shift new shares at the coal-fired Colstrip plant to a shell company.
Friday, the Public Service Commission held a closed session on the case, pending before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and it then announced it had withdrawn.
However, the PSC said it will continue to address related issues “through the state regulatory process,” within the commission’s jurisdiction.
“We will thoroughly investigate at the state level as appropriate,” Commission President Jeff Welborn said in a statement. “We remain committed to acting within our statutory authority, ensuring transparency, protecting Montana ratepayers, and maintaining the reliability of essential utility services.”
The case has raised a number of questions about the way NorthWestern Energy is handling its new shares at Colstrip and about the Public Service Commission’s ability to oversee the monopoly.
NorthWestern Energy earlier announced that it would acquire on Jan. 1, 2026, all of the shares owned by Puget Sound Energy and by Avista at Colstrip, giving the utility 55% control there.
Originally, the utility said existing customers would benefit from the Puget acquisition starting in January 2026.
But a NorthWestern holding company later formed a shell company, called NorthWestern Colstrip 370 PuLLC, and the utility is directing all of the new Puget shares to the subsidiary.
In response to earlier questions from the Public Service Commission, NorthWestern said the subsidiary is not subject to regulation by the PSC.
In October, the NorthWestern subsidiary filed a request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approve a contract to sell energy from the Puget deal on the wholesale market.
That filing raised questions with the Public Service Commission, and initially commissioners called on the feds to investigate the deal.
It also drew opposition from the Montana Environmental Information Center, a conservation watchdog that remains active in the federal case.
The conservation watchdog argued, in part, that before federal regulators take up a question about any wholesale contract, they need to investigate the transfer of assets to the subsidiary — which took place without federal approval.
The organization also said NorthWestern has not provided enough information to show that existing retail customers aren’t subsidizing costs for the wholesale market sales.
On Dec. 3, the Public Service Commission raised similar concerns, including that NorthWestern was proposing to sell power it “neither legally owns nor controls” without the required federal approval.
After its closed meeting Friday, however, the Public Service Commission walked back its protest of the case, at least at the federal level, in a motion to withdraw.
The Public Service Commission said it did so after it gained needed “concessions” from NorthWestern, reviewed the contract between the utility and Puget, and made a decision its efforts were most effective at the state level.
“By withdrawing, we are simply shifting the venue to the state level, where our regulatory oversight and investigative authority are strongest and most direct for Montana ratepayers,” said PSC spokesperson Jamey Petersen in an email.
The Public Service Commission said it confirmed “energy from Colstrip will remain available to meet the needs of Montana retail customers, subject to PSC approval.”
The PSC said in a critical concession, NorthWestern said it “fully understands” that “the inclusion of any associated costs in retail rates and the ultimate use of these assets to serve Montana customers is subject to Montana PSC review and approval.”
NorthWestern has clearly stated its new subsidiary is not subject to Public Service Commission authority. Monday, the PSC could not immediately explain the distinction but said the topic would be addressed as part of an inquiry by the Public Service Commission.
NorthWestern could not be reached late Monday by email.
Details regarding customer impact will be investigated in a new docket about the Puget acquisition, to be discussed Tuesday, Petersen said.
The withdrawal was not unanimously supported by the Public Service Commission, a body of five elected commissioners.
Commissioner Brad Molnar told the Daily Montanan on Monday he viewed it as a “total capitulation.”
“It costs nothing to stay in the fight,” Molnar said.
In a press release, the Public Service Commission said withdrawing from the federal case is a “procedural decision only,” and it will evaluate the merits of NorthWestern’s acquisition of the Puget shares through a separate state investigation.
A spokesperson from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has not responded to questions from the Daily Montanan. However, the Public Service Commission said FERC is expected to decide on NorthWestern’s filing within the next two weeks.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG-0022-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-15 20:56:32.427283

(Photo by Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)Denver City Council voted against a resolution Monday that would have allowed Key Lime Air to lease ground space at Denver International Airport over concerns about the airline’s immigration enforcement flights in recent months.
The resolution would have created a lease for 1,200 feet of space at the airport for Key Lime Air, which also operates as Denver Air Connection. The space would include an area to store items like snow removal equipment, employee parking and an office trailer, according to the proposed lease agreement. Without the lease, the company can still use the common area of a cargo apron.
“When we’re talking about the values of our city, and we stand up here and we say time after time that we support our immigrant community and that we are a welcoming city — I cannot support a corporation that does not prescribe to that,” Council member Serena Gonzales-Gutierrez said.

Two of Key Lime’s airplanes have been used for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement flights to shuffle detained immigrants around the country, primarily to ICE’s hubs in Texas and Louisiana, as first reported by Newsline. During the time period analyzed by Newsline, neither of those planes landed in Colorado. There have been 122 outbound immigration enforcement flights out of Denver this year, according to the most recent ICE Flight Monitor report from Human Rights Watch, though there is little information about which airport those flights are leaving from.










I have no interest in supporting this deportation machine.


– Denver City Council member Sarah Parady


Key Lime Air is headquartered at Centennial Airport in Arapahoe County. It has also operated at Denver International Airport since 2006 as a cargo feeder airline, according to George Karayiannakis, the airport’s senior vice president of airline and commercial affairs.
The airport could stand to lose Federal Aviation Administration grants because of its denial of the lease, which Council member Kevin Flynn cited as his reason for voting in favor of the resolution.
“Voting it down means they won’t be paying us. They’ll be using it for free,” he said. “We can’t kick Key (Lime) Air out of the airport, but we can make them pay to use the piece of concrete that they want to use. Voting this down means they use the common use area for free.”
Flynn was the single vote in favor of the resolution.
“This is where the rubber starts to hit the road, when we start to talk about, what are we going to do in Denver, about what’s happening at the federal level,” Council member Sarah Parady said. “I have no interest in supporting this deportation machine. And if an aviation grant is what’s on the line there, it’s very clear to me where the city should stand on that.”

(Photo by Alyssa Chen/Minnesota Reformer)Over a hundred students at Apple Valley High School walked out of class Monday afternoon to protest federal immigration actions in the Twin Cities metro area.
Freshman Berk Benson, the protest’s organizer, led the crowd of teens in chants — “What do we want? Due process! When do we want it? Now!” — and gave a speech to cheering students at the 2 p.m. walkout, half an hour before the end of the school day.
“I stand up for our neighbors. Whether they’re from Mexico, whether they’re from Somalia, whether they’re from Venezuela,” Benson said, with students behind him flying the flags of those countries along with the American flag. “No matter where they’re from, if you are here, you are on American soil and you are guaranteed the same rights and the same due process that everybody here is guaranteed.”
Several students at the protest said they were worried for their families amid intensified federal immigration activity in recent weeks that has especially targeted Minnesota’s Somali-American community.
Freshmen Furqan Ali, Hamza Ismail and Almis Doualeh, all Somali-American students, said ICE is overstepping.
“I saw Trump’s claims online about how Somalis are bad,” said Ali. “I think we’re hard workers. I’ve known a lot of Somali hard workers. All of my family are in the workforce and everything. I just don’t think those claims are true.”
Though Ali is a U.S. citizen, he said his parents are concerned for his safety. Ismail and Doualeh nodded in agreement. ICE agents have reportedly detained U.S. citizens, including twice last week in the Twin Cities.
“Now I’m less able to go out and stuff because my mom is very worried about ICE taking me away from them,” Ali said.
Senior Kate Soledad Sanchez carried a sign that read “Mis Padres Trabajan Mas Duro Que Tu Presidente” — “My parents work harder than your president.”
Sanchez teared up as she talked about her immigrant parents and the challenges they went through to come to the U.S. from Mexico.
“I personally didn’t think it would become this serious, where ICE is literally everywhere,” Sanchez said.
Sophomore Liliana Oliveras, holding a sign that read “No one is illegal on stolen land,” said she was protesting ICE “because they’ve been taking innocent people.”
Oliveras said that her father, a U.S. citizen whose family is from Puerto Rico, was almost detained by ICE a few months ago.
ICE agents, under the Trump administration, have been accused of violating the constitutional rights of immigrants and American citizens. They have used munitions including pepper spray, tear gas and rubber bullets on protesters — including in the Twin Cities — resulting in injuries.

Benson, 15, said that he organized the walkout to energize resistance to ICE here.
“We’re told our whole lives about American ideals like liberty and justice, but then when you see our government doing stuff like this — like I am a high schooler and I can see that that’s hypocritical,” Benson said after the walkout.
Benson said his friend’s apartment was raided by ICE recently, which partly inspired him in addition to due process violations.
“You have to stand up for people who can’t stand up for themselves or are too scared to stand up for themselves,” he said, adding that some of his friends were too scared to come to the protest.
Nick Benson, Berk Benson’s father, is a longtime planespotter and has observed deportation flights since before President Donald Trump’s second term. He’s been speaking against federal immigration activity as part of Minnesota 50501, which has organized No King’s protests against Trump.

(Photo by Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota’s attorney general says a recent Ethics Commission advisory opinion related to campaign finance law is void, arguing the agency exceeded its authority.
Attorney General Drew Wrigley, in a legal opinion issued late Friday, said the Ethics Commission has no authority to issue an opinion based on general questions of law. 
The 15-page opinion relates to guidance the Ethics Commission issued in June, responding to questions from a Fargo lawmaker about whether campaign funds can be used to pay for a candidate’s child care or security expenses. The commission said in an advisory opinion that campaign funds can be used for child care and security in some instances. 
Secretary of State Michael Howe (Provided)
Secretary of State Michael Howe asked the attorney general to weigh in on the Ethics Commission advisory opinion, pointing out that it’s his office’s responsibility to oversee campaign finance and election laws.
Wrigley determined that state law authorizes the Ethics Commission to address “specified hypothetical facts or prospective conduct,” but not broad questions. As a result, Wrigley wrote the advisory opinion “has no legal effect.”
The attorney general also concluded state law will take precedence if it is ever contradicted by a rule adopted by the Ethics Commission. 
Wrigley said in a statement the opinion “is founded on the bedrock principle that there are three coequal branches in our government, and our courts have been crystal clear in maintaining the appropriate regard for the powers and limitations on each of those separate and equal government branches.”
The Ethics Commission said in a statement it’s reviewing the opinion in order to evaluate next steps. The commission is committed to implementing the constitutional amendment that established the oversight agency, said Executive Director Rebecca Binstock. 
Fargo Democratic Sen. Josh Boschee, the lawmaker who requested the advisory opinion, said he believes the Ethics Commission should have the authority to issue guidance on North Dakota election laws but said he understands the attorney general’s point about the need for specificity. Ultimately, the senator said he wants clarity for political candidates and people considering whether or not to run for office. 
Campaign finance at heart of latest skirmish between executive branch, ND Ethics Commission

“That’s why we ask these questions. We want to make sure we’re doing it correctly,” Boschee said. 
In a statement on Monday, Howe said child care and security expenses are not specifically listed in state law as “political activities” and should be considered a “personal use.” He pointed to Wrigley’s legal opinion, which states the use of campaign funds for personal use is a misdemeanor.
Howe also said his office is where people should direct questions about campaign finance and election law. Boschee said he first posed the child care question to Howe but was not given an answer. Howe has said he doesn’t recall receiving the inquiry.
The Ethics Commission, created by voters in 2018, was given the authority by the Legislature to issue advisory opinions. 
Senate Majority Leader David Hogue, R-Minot, said the attorney general’s opinion will likely inspire lawmakers to consider amending that statute to ensure future opinions have a “limited scope.”
“We don’t want somebody to be able to use the advisory opinion process to, in effect, create new law,” Hogue said. 
The Ethics Commission advisory opinion also received criticism from Gov. Kelly Armstrong, who has said the question about use of campaign funds is a policy issue, not an ethical question. Armstrong also expressed concerns that the opinion had the effect of creating a new law without input from the Legislature.
Another section of Wrigley’s opinion overrules a 2020 opinion from his predecessor, Wayne Stenehjem, related to the commission’s rules that define lobby and lobbyist. Stenehjem said the Ethics Commission could expand the definition in state law in order to carry out the agency’s constitutional directive prohibiting lobbyists from providing gifts to public officials. 
Stenehjem also wrote that if rules passed by the Ethics Commission conflict with state law, the state constitution mandates that the Ethics Commission’s rule should prevail.
Wrigley wrote that his office reexamined those questions more fully and determined the constitution “does not permit the Commission to step into the shoes of the Legislative Assembly to make law.”

Supporters say the fee unduly burdens low-income residents.,"Towns would be barred from charging fees to people using public defenders under the bill. Supporters say the fee unduly burdens low-income residents. (Photo by New Jersey Monitor)The Senate Judiciary Committee approved legislation that would end municipalities’ ability to charge for public defenders in a party-line vote Monday.
The bill would repeal a law that allows municipalities to charge indigent defendants up to $200 for representation in municipal court, a fee the bill’s backers say unduly burdens residents who already cannot afford legal representation.
“This fee can deter people from applying for a public defender and thus undermines the purpose of public defenders: to ensure that all people, regardless of their financial situation, can access legal counsel when they are accused of a crime,” said Lauren Aung, a policy fellow at the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey.
Bill would allow NJ towns to hike fees to fund homelessness reduction

Clients can repay the fee over up to four months. The collections can only be used to pay for low-income defendants’ legal representation.
Some Republican members of the committee said they worried about how eliminating the fee would impact local finances. Sen. Kristin Corrado (R-Passaic) said those costs had become more pressing as more cases are referred to municipal authorities.
“You’re looking at it as a revenue generator for the town. When I look at it, it’s just going toward covering the cost for the public defender that the town is obligated to pay for and the taxpayers are obligated to pay for, so waiving the fee is not going to make more funding available for public defenders,” she said.
Judges, she added, have the discretion under existing law to waive the fee if a defendant lacks the means to pay it and the debt would amount to an unreasonable burden.
The bill’s supporters said the fees generate little revenue at the local level, often accounting for a small fraction of a municipality’s annual spending.
In East Orange, public defender fees brought the municipality just $3,523 in 2024, Aung said, or about 1.5% of the $229,965 the municipality spent on public defenders that year. The city’s 2024 budget called for $195.2 million in spending.
“It’s simply not making much of a difference in terms of the court budget,” said Peter Chen, a senior policy analyst for progressive think tank New Jersey Policy Perspective. “It is making a huge difference in terms of these defendants and their families and their ability to not be financially burdened by relatively low-level contact with the criminal legal system.”
Relying on judges’ discretion to waive fees could lead to inconsistent outcomes, Aung said.
Gov. Phil Murphy in 2023 signed legislation that eliminated fees for representation by state public defenders, but the bill left in place fees paid at the local level.
Officials from the Office of the Public Defender supported the shift. The roughly $4 million collected through the state fee before its sunset accounted for less than 3% of the office’s budget in fiscal year 2023 and did not flow directly to the office, which had staff devoted to chasing defendants’ unpaid debts.

The event was held less than two days after an antisemitic attack in Sydney, Australia. Shooters targeting a Hanukkah celebration killed 16 people and injured dozens.
Gov. Josh Shapiro, the highest ranking Jewish official in Pennsylvania, spoke at the event. He urged Pennsylvania’s Jews to take solace in tradition and remember the joyful message of the holiday.
“Tonight, as we light this Chanukiah, we do so hoping that the candles will illuminate a bit brighter, that it will bring more light into our lives given the darkness that we have experienced,” Shapiro said. “The answer to that darkness is more light, the answer to that darkness is to express more pride in our faith.”

Shapiro also nodded to the attack on his family at the Governor’s Residence in April.
A Dauphin County man, Cody Balmer, set off multiple molotov cocktails in the Governor’s Residence on the first night of Passover while Shapiro and his family slept inside. He told police that he would “not take part in [Shapiro’s] plans for what he wants to do to the Palestinian people” and would have killed Shapiro with a hammer had he come across him.
But in spite of the recent violence, speakers at the menorah lighting, including Shapiro, encouraged Jewish Pennsylvanians to celebrate proudly.
“Even in our grief, we gather here in the Pennsylvania state Capitol to kindle the menorah to recall the miracle from 2,100 years ago when the Maccabees were victorious,” said Rabbi Shmuel Pewzner, who presided over the ceremony. “We know that in the darkest night, our light will leave no space for darkness to remain. That is precisely why we place the menorah in public. Not to hide, not to hesitate, but to declare we are here. We always will be here.”
The event was also attended by a handful of lawmakers, Rep. Jill Cooper (R-Westmoreland), Rep. Justin Fleming (D-Dauphin), Sen. Patty Kim (D-Dauphin) and Rep. Jared Solomon (D-Philadelphia).
“When I found out about your lighting ceremony, I came down to let you know that we’re standing with you,” said Rep. Cooper. “Westmoreland County is 30 miles east of Pittsburgh, and I just want you to know we love you, and we support you, and we’re here standing with you today.”
Pittsburgh’s Jewish community experienced the deadliest antisemitic attack in American History in 2018, when a gunman opened fire at a synagogue in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood, killing 11 people and injuring seven others.
Rep. Solomon said his grandparents came to America to flee antisemitic pogroms in Europe, settling in Philadelphia.
“When they came, Northeast Philadelphia was not necessarily very accepting of Jews, but they were always very present and prideful,” Solomon said. “I saw him pridefully walk to shul with his yarmulke … He was so proud of being Jewish, and this is the moment that that pride is so important.”
Fleming noted that his children attended a Dauphin County Jewish Community Center (JCC).
“Part of the reason why I stand here each and every year is because my kids, in spite of being Christian, got the wonderful teaching of how to become a really good person [at the JCC],” Fleming said. “They learned how to be better people, better neighbors, better friends.”
A choir of students from the Harrisburg Silver Academy, a Jewish school, sang as the menorah was lit.
In his speech, Shapiro also noted Pennsylvania’s origins, founded by William Penn under the principle of religious freedom.
“Think about where we are today,” Shapiro said. “We are here in the state capitol, in the place that Penn founded called Pennsylvania, about to light a Chanukiah openly, and freely and proudly for all to see. That’s extraordinary progress that we’ve made in our country, and I believe Pennsylvania remains a light to the nations — an example to the nation — as Penn had hoped.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_8513-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-15 19:57:53.734648

First-term Salt Lake City Council member Eva Lopez Chavez announced her candidacy Monday after weeks of speculation of a potential run.
Lopez Chavez, the first Mexican-American to be elected to the City Council, said in a campaign announcement that as a daughter of a working-class immigrant family, she’s hoping to fight for people with similar backgrounds.
“Now, as we face crisis after crisis, we must say to each other, ‘Enough is enough,’” she said in an ad posted on social media. “That’s why I’m running for Congress. To stop this cycle and defend our communities.”

Her platform isn’t just focused on solving the affordability crisis, Lopez Chavez said, but also the defense of families, the environment and the new district’s future.
“It’s time for the next generation of leadership, and I’m ready to step up,” she said, “ready to make sure that every Utahn has access to homeownership opportunities, reproductive rights and to steward our greatest resources, the Wasatch mountains and our Great Salt Lake.”
If a ruling on an anti-gerrymandering lawsuit holds and the map submitted to the courts by plaintiffs is used in the 2026 elections, Democrats will have a strong chance of winning a seat, prompting several candidacy announcements. Republicans are expected to contest that ruling to the Utah Supreme Court.
Currently, Lopez Chavez is running against other prominent Salt Lake County Democrats, including Utah’s last Democrat in Congress, Ben McAdams, Sen. Kathleen Riebe of Cottonwood Heights, Sen. Nate Blouin of Millcreek, and former state Sen. Derek Kitchen.
Lopez Chavez, who was elected to the City Council in 2024, is also a consultant to businesses and other organizations. She’s also a member of the LGBTQ+ community, according to her biography, and has been involved in different community engagement efforts “with a focus on social justice for marginalized communities.”

Dec. 15, 2025. (Courtesy of Governor's Office)LINCOLN — Five of Nebraska’s 49 state lawmakers Monday toured the controversial ICE migrant detention center in McCook, taking the Pillen administration up on a group invite to walk through the converted prison. 
The lone Democrat participating, State Sen. Margo Juarez of Omaha, estimated that between 100 and 150 migrants, all of them men, were being held at what state and federal officials call the “Cornhusker Clink.”

Except for new fencing, Juarez said much of the physical facility looked similar to what she had seen when she arrived unannounced inSeptember, when the McCook prison still operated as the state’s Work Ethic Camp, aimed at stepping people toward lives outside of prison. 
Several detainees of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Monday were outside exercising, she said. A TV, a small library and a medical office were visible. 
Some detainees inside played cards, according to observations by other senators on the tour, a group that included State Sens. Myron Dorn of Adams, Tom Brandt of Plymouth, Rob Clements of Elmwood and Dan Lonowski of Hastings.
Some key differences this time,  Juarez said, were the backgrounds, languages and cultures of those being held at the center, which previously held Nebraska inmates nearing release. 
The lawmakers told the Examiner the current detainees represented multiple countries, including Russia, India, Somalia, Mexico and Guatemala. 
“I still think that how this is being done is wrong, and I’m not happy the place exists,” Juarez said after the visit, which lasted more than an hour. 
 Frustrated 

But she and the other participating senators said the facility appeared clean, orderly and that detainees had access to visitors and a list of pro bono lawyers.
Juarez said she remains frustrated with federal immigration laws and enforcement tactics and said that pressure for change should be placed on Congress and at the ballot box.
“That change is what is needed so we’re not wasting our federal tax dollars,” she said, citing studies that immigration arrests under the Trump administration continued to increase but that an ever-lager share of arrests were solely for immigration violations and not for crimes the administration said would be its focus.

The tour of the McCook facility was offered to all 49 senators in the officially nonpartisan Legislature  two days after State Sen. Michaela Cavanaugh of Omaha publicly criticized Gov. Jim Pillen’s administration for twice denying her entry on Nov. 12 and 13 to the McCook facility.
Cavanaugh initially arrived unannounced to the McCook facility Nov. 12, citing a state law that says members of the Legislature can enter such a state facility “at any time.” She was rejected and tried again the next morning, on Nov. 13, after alerting the Department of Correctional Services the prior evening.
Pillen on Monday said in a statement that the McCook facility has been up and running in its new role since November and said Monday was “a good opportunity for senators to come and see first-hand the operational aspects of the detention facility.”
Legislators were required to fill out a form by the end of the work day Friday to attend, which was sent to federal officials prior to the visit.
A Pillen spokesperson said reporters were not allowed on the Monday tour, which was led by Rob Jeffreys, the state’s director of Correctional Services. The Examiner spoke to the five lawmakers afterward.
 Time in McCook varies

Jeffreys had told Cavanaugh that her alert in November was problematic, as came with notice that was too short. Furthermore, he and a spokesperson for the Pillen administration said they interpret state law differently as it relates to entry to the McCook facility. 
The state contracts with and is paid by the Department of Homeland Security and ICE to house the federal detainees at the McCook center while the detainees await deportation to other countries.
Lawmakers invited to tour state-run ICE jail as group after Cavanaugh complaint

Cavanaugh declined to participate in the tour, saying she had previous commitments and also that it was unclear last week whether lawmakers would be allowed to bring a pen and paper into the facility, “let alone a phone” to perhaps record observations. She said one of her main goals was to ask questions of detainees and gather information in the event they needed services.
Lawmakers on the tour said they did not bring phones on the tour, but had access to staff members to answer questions. Some questions, including the average number of detainees each day, were not answered.
Senators said they were told that the range of time behind bars at the McCook facility ranged from a day for some, while others have been there since it pivoted to federal use. 
Pillen said earlier that detainees started to arrive in early November and that he had expected 200 by Thanksgiving and up to 300 when other facility modifications were completed.
Brandt said the group was told many of the detainees are transported to McCook from the Omaha and North Platte airports, but that senators were not told the cities or states where the ICE detainees were originally arrested. 
The five senators said they didn’t personally talk to detainees but said they were not prohibited from doing so. 
They said at least some detainees had access to electronic tablets.

“It was very clean, well kept, very well run,” Dorn said of the former Work Ethic Camp facility. 
“It seemed very peaceful, the dining room where they eat was nice,” said Clements. He said phone numbers for various foreign consulates were posted on a wall, and he could see a bank of phones available for detainee use.
The senators saw technology that allows detainees to attend immigration court hearings remotely. 
Lonowski said he was impressed with the professionalism of staff, who appeared to be from the local area.
 More construction this week

Dorn said he would have liked to see more lawmakers, but he said some had other commitments. 
“I definitely expected a few more,” he said, saying he thought up to 15. “I’m glad five showed.”
Prior to the state senator visits, McCook Mayor Linda Taylor and McCook Police Chief Kevin Hodgson had their own tour of the facility. 
Pillen’s statement said construction begins this week to expand the facility’s capacity from 200 to 300 detainees. 
He said that as a federal detention center, compensation to Correctional Services,  based on the expected use of the facility and costs associated with providing services to ICE, will be $2.45 million per month. 
The arrangement with ICE should clear the state about $14.25 million annually, Pillen said. The current contact expires Sept. 29, 2027.

(Photo courtesy of Miller-Meeks' office)U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks said Monday the health care bill she is leading in the U.S. House would address the “root causes” behind rising health care premiums while not seeking to extend Affordable Care Act subsidies.
The “Lower Health Care Premiums for All Americans Act,” sponsored by Miller-Meeks, is House Republicans’ proposal to tackle rising health care costs amid growing concerns about the end of ACA enhanced tax credits at the end of the year.
Miller-Meeks said during a call with Iowa reporters that House Republicans’ proposal focuses on changes that “actually lower costs and put patients and their doctors back in charge, and back in the driver’s seat.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The legislation contains multiple proposals that Miller-Meeks said would reduce premium costs, including providing funding for cost-sharing reduction payments under the ACA beginning in 2027. “Cost-sharing reductions” lower deductibles, copayments and out-of-pocket maximums for one of the ACA plans, depending on income. The bill also adds new requirements for pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) to share information on prescription drug costs and other decisions.
Additionally, the legislation would allow more access to Association Health Plans, with Miller-Meeks saying the legislation would let more employers, including self-employed workers, “get the same benefits through the Obamacare that larger companies have.” It also makes changes to the definition of stop-loss insurance and codifies and makes changes to CHOICE rules that allow employers to offer defined contributions for employees purchasing their own health coverage plans.
“Simply put, this bill puts patients and their doctors over the profits of insurance companies,” Miller-Meeks said. “… We want to make (all) Americans — families and patients — the CEOs of their own health care decisions, in concert with their providers or their doctors. It’s smart, common-sense policy, it’s long overdue, and it’s the kind of health care reform that the American people have been waiting for, and actually gets at lowering premiums and lowering health care costs.”
Miller-Meeks points finger at Democrats for tax credit expiration
The ACA tax credits, created in 2021 and extended from the Inflation Reduction Act during the Biden administration, were the focus of the 43-day government shutdown as Senate Democrats sought to extend the subsidies again, warning health care premiums would spike if the expiration goes through.
The shutdown ended with no action taken on the issue. Two competing measures on lowering health care costs failed to advance last week in the Senate, as Democrats’ plan to extend the ACA tax credits as well as Republicans’ proposal to provide funding through Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) for some people who receive coverage through the ACA marketplace in 2026 and 2027 both failed to earn the 60 votes needed to advance.
Miller-Meeks and other Republicans who have argued against continuing the ACA subsidies said the tax credits are giving money to insurance companies using taxpayer dollars instead of finding means to decrease the costs of health coverage for consumers. She also said Monday that the enhanced premium tax credits were approved and extended without Republican support — and that the expiration date was also approved during those votes.
“So to say to Republicans, ‘We want you to do with a (small) majority what we could not do when we had all three branches of government,’ I think, is a little bit of hypocrisy and a little bit of shifting blame,” Miller-Meeks said. “They put the expiration date in it. … I can tell you, all Republicans agree on this — we want to lower health care costs for everyone, not just a select few, and we don’t want to continue to enrich profitable insurance companies.”
While Miller-Meeks said extending subsidies would mean giving money to insurance companies that “have no incentive to lower premiums because they’re getting a direct subsidy from the federal government,” she also said she does not “expect individuals to forgo health care that they need” as health care premiums are expected to rise in 2026 if the tax credits end.
While the measure does not address the expiration of ACA subsidies, she said the goal of the legislation is to provide longer-term decreases in premium costs.
“We’re trying to address the root causes, rather than should just gloss over and hide them and obscure the fact that premiums are going up,” Miller-Meeks said. “So we’re actually proactively working to reduce health costs for everyone, to get to those root causes that drive up costs. ”
She said the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office “has scored that this will lower premiums, and lower premiums for half of the people in exchanges, as well as lower premiums for other individuals.”
Democrats say Miller-Meeks’ plan won’t stop cost increases
However, Democrats and other opponents say the measure would not effectively stop health care costs from rising as expected if subsidies end. Katie Smith, a spokesperson for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said the legislation is the latest action this year by Miller-Meeks that would hurt Iowans’ access to health care.
“Mariannette Miller-Meeks has spent her entire year attacking Iowans’ health care, from voting for the largest Medicaid cuts in history that will decimate rural hospitals, to opposing plans to prevent Iowans’ health care costs from skyrocketing,” Smith said in a statement. “Now, Miller-Meeks has made herself the face of Washington Republicans’ so-called ‘plan’ that does nothing to lower costs, and Iowans will hold her accountable for failing them next year.”
The measure faces difficult odds of making it to the President Donald Trump’s desk. Even if the measure passes in the House, it appears unlikely to clear the 60-vote threshold required in the Senate. Trump has also stated he continues to prefer a plan to give direct federal payments to Americans over Republican proposals making other changes.
Miller-Meeks said there are “bipartisan” components of the bill that she believes will gain traction with members of both parties.
“I think that it will get through the House, and I think it has an extremely good chance of getting through the Senate as well too,” Miller-Meek said. “As I said, Republicans are all focused on lowering health care costs for everyone. I do think we’ll have some Democrats join this bill as well.”
The House Rules Committee is scheduled to discuss the bill and possible amendments on Tuesday.

The subpoena is void because lawmakers’ investigation was illegal, Becky Hadlock contends in motion to dismiss. 
The post Embattled Weston County clerk asks court to dismiss subpoena case appeared first on WyoFile .","An attorney for Weston County Clerk Becky Hadlock wants a judge to toss the criminal case over his client’s failure to appear at a legislative committee meeting where she had been subpoenaed to testify, new court filings show. 
“Through this prosecution, the State of Wyoming seeks to enforce a legislative subpoena issued to Weston County Clerk Becky Hadlock,” the motion filed Monday states. “But that subpoena was void from the start so this prosecution must fail as a matter of law.” 
During an appearance in Natrona County Circuit Court, Hadlock pleaded not guilty in November to a misdemeanor charge of defying a legislative subpoena. 
Months earlier, the Legislature’s Management Audit Committee subpoenaed the clerk to appear at its September meeting in Casper. At the time, the panel was investigating Hadlock for her role in a miscount and subsequent audit in the November 2024 election. The miscount stemmed from an error in her office and led to a dramatic undercount in the number of votes for a state lawmaker who was running unopposed.
But such an investigation is not the purview of the Management Audit Committee, argues Ryan Semerad, Hadlock’s defense attorney. 
“State law assigns all investigations into suspected violations of Wyoming’s Election Code to the Executive Department through the Wyoming Attorney General, the local county prosecuting attorney, or the county sheriff,” Semerad’s motion states. (Emphasis from the filing.)
Furthermore, Semerad argues, the committee “violated its own enabling and governing statutes when it launched a public investigation into Clerk Hadlock for allegedly violating Wyoming’s Election Code.” 
State law assigns the committee’s investigations, or audits, to the Legislative Service Office and requires strict confidentiality, according to the filings. 
“The [Management Audit Committee’s] member-directed and public investigation into allegations that Clerk Hadlock broke the law was illegal two times over,” the motion states. 
In a third argument for dismissing the case, Semerad contends that Hadlock was not given “fair notice and a reasonable opportunity to obtain counsel and meaningfully respond to the subpoena.” 
“Even if the [committee] possessed any authority to act as it did, the [committee] violated Clerk Hadlock’s due process rights by serving her with a subpoena compelling her to travel 165 miles to provide in-person testimony on six days’ notice, including two weekend days,” the motion states. 
Alongside the motion to dismiss, Hadlock also requested a hearing and a notice that the court may want to certify questions of law to the district court.

How we got here
Hadlock’s conduct came into question by state lawmakers and other officials soon after errors in the November 2024 election resulted in a dramatic undercount of votes for Speaker of the House Chip Neiman, R-Hulett, in last year’s general election. 
Neiman was majority floor leader at the time and running unopposed for House District 1, which includes Weston County. Initial results showed Neiman received only 166 votes, with another 1,289 voters undervoting, or leaving that part of their ballot unmarked. 
Those numbers caught the attention of officials including Secretary of State Chuck Gray, who tried to contact Hadlock on election night. When she didn’t answer, Gray contacted the local sheriff’s office, who went to her home. 
It was soon discovered that Hadlock’s mistake of using misprinted ballots caused the miscount. While a hand count of ballots resolved the matter, a post-election audit submitted by Hadlock also raised additional concerns. 
Since then, multiple investigations have been completed, including by Gray, who recommended Hadlock’s removal from office. 
Meanwhile, Gov. Mark Gordon is now investigating Hadlock for a second time after four of her constituents submitted official complaints. After the first investigation, Gordon concluded in May that while “Hadlock made many serious mistakes in the 2024 Weston County elections, her actions do not rise to the level of misconduct or malfeasance, as I understand the meaning of those terms in this situation.”
The process, as laid out in state statute, does not give the governor unilateral discretion to remove an elected official. Instead, the governor is tasked with determining whether to recommend that the attorney general seek the clerk’s removal in district court.

Frank of the National Park Service | Public domain via Flickr). The Montana Department of Natural Resources filed in court last month their arguments for a court upholding an agreement they struck with Crazy Mountain Ranch last summer, as the elite getaway seeks to avoid paying an $8,000 fine for illegal use of water this summer.
Crazy Mountain said it didn’t know the water it was purchasing couldn’t be used to irrigate a golf course, as a long-running saga over water usage by the ranch.
For a week in August, the Yellowstone Club-affiliated ranch was trucking water from the City of Boulder to irrigate its 112-acre golf course near Big Timber, after a lawsuit led to the water commissioners personally shutting off the ranch’s water. Crazy Mountain Ranch subsequently sued two Park County Water Commissioners. 
The ranch then bought water from Boulder from Aug. 13 to Aug. 20, which was a violation of the Montana Water Use Act. The DNRC found Boulder sold Crazy Mountain water from a well “for which there was no water right,” a letter from the agency stated. 
In court documents, the DNRC said the ranch using the water it bought from Boulder for the golf course violated the consent decree the ranch agreed to over the summer. Officials asked Crazy Mountain for the $8,000 by Oct. 3, according to a letter sent by the DNRC to the ranch.
The consent decree lays out several facts the parties have agreed to, as well as penalties for Crazy Mountain should they not abide by those rules. 
When notified they were in violation of the act, the city stopped bulk water sales, court documents say. 
“Boulder’s instant compliance stands in stark contrast to CMR’s prolonged obstinance at every turn,” the DNRC legal brief reads.
The City of Boulder did not immediately return a comment request. Now, the exclusive ranch is trying to get out of a fine it blames on the DNRC and City of Boulder. Lawyers for the ranch filed a brief in October saying they shouldn’t be held liable.
“CMR purchased water from the City of Boulder (“Boulder”). DNRC admits that Boulder holds municipal rights that allow it to sell water for use outside the city limits,” the brief reads. “Nothing in the consent decree states that CMR must independently verify that a municipality offering municipal water rights for sale has fully complied with the MWUA. Nor does the MWUA impose any such requirement.”
In its response, the DNRC said it’s not their fault a private company didn’t know the rules. 
“CMR’s ignorance of this information – which is the direct result of its own lack of due diligence – does not excuse the simple fact that it irrigated the golf course with water that was not authorized for either that use or sale, in violation of the consent decree,” the DNRC brief reads. “In its attempt to distract from its clear violation of the consent Decree and its repeated failure to comply with the MWUA, CMR assigns blame to the City of Boulder and DNRC.”
The state says it has acted in good faith as well.
“CMR’s argument that it has been treated differently than Boulder is both irrelevant and factually inaccurate,” the DNRC brief reads. “Notably, despite CMR’s admission that it illegally irrigated the golf course between June 2024 and July 8, 2025, DNRC did not seek fines for those violations of the MWUA once CMR agreed to enter into the consent decree.”
The Crazy Mountain ranch sits on about 18,000 acres north of Livingston and west of Big Timber. The watershed the ranch sits in flows into the Yellowstone River and, ultimately, the Missouri River.
A spokesperson for Crazy Mountain said they are awaiting a date for oral arguments.
“Nothing in the court-approved agreement requires CMR to verify that municipalities legally authorized to sell water are complying with the Montana Water Use Act,” said Peter Scott, attorney for CMR in a statement. “DNRC’s effort to hold CMR responsible for violations by others simply reinforces our concern that DNRC is selectively enforcing the Water Use Act. That’s why CMR asked a court to review the matter.’’",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/49945863331_bcd4562ef1_k-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-15 19:57:53.734648

When the West was being settled, black bears were wiped out from much of their native range. Slowly, they’ve reoccupied much of that habitat in Wyoming and beyond.
The post Black bears are thriving and reclaiming old Wyoming haunts, even amid record hunting appeared first on WyoFile .","Where Rob Brossman operates bait sites in the southeast corner of the Wind River Range, he knows there are plenty of black bears out there to gobble up the peanuts he leaves. 
“I know the population where I hunt is getting bigger and bigger,” Brossman said, “because I’m seeing a lot of bears.” 
Although Brossman, his friends and family might only pull the trigger on two or three of the bruins a year at the sites he maintains, he’s seeing 15 or 20 individual animals annually. It’s a clear and noticeable increase from when he first started hunting in Wyoming a decade ago, he said.
Brossman shared that view at a Dec. 2 Wyoming Game and Fish Department public meeting in Lander about black bear hunting. In the unit where Brossman hunts, the agency was weighing a proposal to increase the maximum number of female bears that could be killed by four, about which he offered no misgivings. Increased quotas have also been proposed in the Gros Ventre Range, Sierra Madre Range, Snowy Range and the Laramie Mountains. 
The Lander outdoorsman’s observation about seeing more black bears in southwestern Fremont County aligns with a statewide trend. It’s a golden era of modern, regulated black bear hunting, with a new record number of animals killed each of the last three years. Since the late 1990s, the number of black bear hunting licenses sold has roughly tripled, jumping from 2,000 to nearly 7,000. Hunter success rates have stayed around 10%, and as a result, the tally of hunter-killed bears has tripled, climbing from under 200 to nearly 700 annually.
Interest in black bear hunting and the number of bears that hunters kill have both steadily increased over the past three decades. (Wyoming Game and Fish Department)
Yet simultaneously, populations are doing well — so well that Ursus americanus is even reoccupying old areas within its native range where the species has been functionally absent since the Western settlement era. 
“From here, we’ve seen expansion into Green Mountain, the Seminoes,” Game and Fish Large Carnivore Supervisor Dan Thompson said at the Lander meeting. “From other directions, we’ve seen expansion east of the Bighorns. It’s not monumental. It’s more incremental.” 
The only major chunk of forested Wyoming habitat black bears have not truly reoccupied is in the state’s far northeast corner, such as the Bear Lodge Mountains and Black Hills. But even there, hunters have “picked up a few,” Thompson said, and there are indications that black bears are starting to reoccupy the region — just like mountain lions did around the turn of the century. 
The recent gains are tied to healthy densities and black bears being managed as a game species. There are limits on the number of females that can be killed in 33 of 35 Wyoming hunt areas. The exceptions are: area 32, located in the lower-elevation parts of the Bighorn Basin, and area 35, which stretches across the state from the southwest to the northeast and was formerly mostly unoccupied. Because females are the reproductive engines of the population, this management strategy has enabled the incremental expansion Wyoming is now experiencing. 
“Hunting is not negatively impacting black bear populations, and I would say that across North America,” Thompson said.

All around the Lower 48, black bears are increasing their range, according to news reports from West Texas, Louisiana, central Minnesota and Michigan.
Generally, black bear populations have done well and the species has regained old ground without major pushback. There have been recent high-profile, unsuccessful efforts to politicize the management of large carnivores like mountain lions and grizzly bears.
“I would say there’s not the controversial drama with black bears as there is with some of the other species we have,” Thompson said. 
There have been a few exceptions. After the severe winter of 2022-’23 walloped herds of mule deer and pronghorn, emotional hunting outfitters called for wildlife managers to knock back several carnivore species, black bears included, in the Wyoming Range.   
State officials complied and boosted efforts to kill mountain lions and coyotes, but they left the black bear hunting regulations unchanged, partly because they were able to demonstrate the bruins were already being intensively hunted. 
“We’re essentially harvesting up to a third of the population annually,” Thompson said. 
Wyoming has 35 distinct black bear hunting areas grouped into eight larger bear management units. (Wyoming Game and Fish Department)
One point of evidence is in the age structure, he said. Like with mountain lions in most places statewide, the black bear population in the Wyoming Range is “primarily a sub-adult population,” because older animals get hunted out. 
To black bear hunting advocate Joe Kondelis, the species’ growth in Wyoming and nationally “highlights the message that hunting is conservation.”  
“We can have regulated hunting seasons for a species and at the same time increase numbers and the health of a population,” said Kondelis, a Cody resident who presides over the American Bear Foundation. “We have healthy populations across the U.S., and we are even seeing new hunting opportunities in places like Louisiana and Florida.”
In Kondelis’ view, Game and Fish has done a “good job” of balancing Wyoming black bear hunting opportunities with the conservation of the species. That’s “difficult,” he added, because it’s becoming evermore popular to hunt black bear, and yet it’s a species that has a slow reproductive rate, at least relative to commonly hunted ungulates like elk or deer. 
“To me, it’s a testament to the survivability of black bears,” Kondelis said. “They are one of the most adaptable species in North America. They are so unique and just don’t get the credit they deserve as a species.”

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)Details about the man believed to have fatally shot two Brown University students and injured nine more are coming into focus, with new videos and photos released by public officials in a press conference late Monday afternoon.
The series of five short video clips and photographs captured from neighborhood property cameras include blurred images of the person’s face, partially obscured by what looks like a pandemic-era medical mask, as he walked the streets a few blocks east of the building where the shooting took place, about two hours beforehand on Saturday. Instead of black clothing, as previously described, he wears a two-colored jacket that appears dark gray and green.


Report a tip
Anyone with information regarding the Brown University shooting can submit an anonymous tip by phone to the FBI at 1 (800) 225-5324 or the Providence Police Department at (401) 272-3121. Information, including photo and video evidence, can also be submitted online via the FBI website. 


As the manhunt continues for the suspect, law enforcement are seeking more tips from the public, with the FBI offering a $50,000 reward for anyone who comes forward with information that leads to the identification, arrest and conviction of the individual responsible. The suspect is believed to be about 5-foot-8 with a stocky build, described as “armed and dangerous” according to the FBI poster.
The evidence comes more than 48 hours after the shooting at Brown’s Barus and Holley engineering building, but wasn’t collected until Monday, Col. Oscar Perez, Providence Police chief, told Rhode Island Current after the press conference.
Perez remained tight-lipped about the progress of the investigation, including personal connections to the victims or the Ivy League campus. 
“It’s a great question and something we are all asking ourselves,” Perez said.
A targeted attack
For the first time, Perez publicly confirmed that investigators believe the shooting was a targeted attack against the university.
Indeed, the video clips posted to X show the suspect walking back and forth across the same small section of the East Side neighborhood, pausing multiple times as he appears to take stock of the surroundings. At one point, he changes direction and clasps his hands together behind his back as he gazes up.
Perez also confirmed the weapon used as a 9 millimeter firearm, with multiple rounds fired. 
Investigators had previously detained a person of interest found in a Coventry hotel early Sunday, but released him at around 12:30 a.m. Monday, declaring him cleared. But not before his name was publicly circulated via national news reports, prompting a second round of scolding by Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha.
“It’s one of the reasons we use words carefully,” Neronha said, explaining the difference between someone detained for questioning, versus held in custody on suspicion of committing a crime. 
And as federal prosecutors descended on the Hampton Inn in Coventry early Sunday, other investigators were working on alternative leads and tips, Neronha said. 
“These investigations are like threads that you pull on a garment,” Neronha said. “Some of them you pull, and the garment doesn’t open up. Other ones you pull and the garment comes undone.”










These investigations are like threads that you pull on a garment. Some of them you pull, and the garment doesn't open up. Other ones you pull and the garment comes undone. 


– Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha 


Federal and state investigators were seen combing sidewalks and properties across the East Side Monday afternoon, looking for more evidence of the shooter’s path. The return to the scene of the crime was prompted by additional tips and video and photo evidence, which has increased significantly with footage submitted from business owners and residents that were closed or away for the weekend, Neronha said.
Ted Docks, special agent in charge for the FBI’s Boston field office, which is assisting Providence police and other local and state law enforcement, said the federal agency continues to process evidence from the neighborhood while investigators at its Quantico, Virginia, laboratory work to recreate the scene of the crime, documenting the trajectories of the bullets.
“It’s painstaking work and we are asking the public to be patient as we continue to run down every lead,” Docks said, adding that no amount of information was “too small or irrelevant.”
Perez acknowledged the length of the time that has elapsed since the shooting but reiterated the Providence agency’s dedication and professionalism in finding the suspect. 
“There’s no one that wants to put this individual in handcuffs [more] than us,” Perez said.

A city on edge 
Mayor Brett Smiley acknowledged the fear and grief that has gripped the capital city, evidenced by local residents, workers and students he had spoken with throughout the weekend and into Monday. Yet the city did not renew the lockdown order that was lifted early Sunday, after the previous person of interest was detained because there have been no new “credible” threats, Smiley said.
“It is going to be hard for my city to feel safe going forward,” Smiley said. “This has shaken us. That will be true tomorrow. I suspect that will be true the day after the general convicts someone. This is a process to restore a sense of safety.”
Providence schools opened as usual Monday and will continue with regular schedules Tuesday, with additional security officers on-hand to help reassure students and parents, Smiley said. 
Recalling the 200-plus person crowd that gathered in Lippitt Memorial Park on the Providence-Pawtucket line in sub-freezing temperatures Sunday night to honor the victims, Smiley said “This is a tight-knit community that looks out for each other.”
Some neighborhood residents have lamented the lack of emergency notifications from the city during and after the shooting. But Smiley rebuffed criticisms of the city’s alert system, saying it worked as intended for everyone who signed up, with text messages continuing to be sent out through Monday afternoon.
Smiley’s tone grew sharper when asked about the onus placed on the university. President Donald Trump said earlier today that the tragedy was a “school problem” while defending the FBI’s role in the investigation.
“So far, we’ve done a very good job of doing it,” Trump said of the federal investigation. “With the various times this has happened, they’ve done it in pretty much record time. But you really have to ask the school a little bit more about that, because this was a school problem. They had their own guards, they had their own police, they had their own everything. But you’d have to ask that question, really, to the school, not to the FBI. We came in after the fact, and the FBI will do a good job, but they came in after the fact.”
Smiley’s response: “I do not accept that criticism.”
Unlike prior press conferences, no one representing the university attended Monday afternoon’s event. Smiley said it did not signify their lack of support, instead explaining that because the updates focused on the continued law enforcement efforts to find the suspect, there was no need for the university to have a presence.
However, Smiley said he was unable to directly answer reporters’ questions about why Brown did not activate its sirens when the shooting took place. 
Throughout the 30-minute briefing with reporters, public officials repeatedly stressed the need to verify information from official sources, noting the confusion and misinformation that spread in the days since the attack. That included reports of what initially sounded like gunfire reported on Pitman Street in the midst of the university campus Monday morning, but was later confirmed to be a boiler that backfired, according to news reports.
There were no additional updates on the eight victims still in treatment at Rhode Island hospital. One person has already been released. The two students killed were also publicly identified Monday.
Officials do not expect to provide additional public updates Monday.

Four Las Cruces doctors donned their white coats and headed to Santa Fe on Monday to urge lawmakers to pursue major medical malpractice and tax reform legislation at the upcoming legislative session. 
Without immediate legislative action, the doctors told the interim legislative Revenue Stabilization and Tax Policy committee, New Mexico will continue losing doctors, and patients statewide will suffer as a result. According to their presentation, the state saw a net loss of 248 doctors — an 8.1% decline — between 2019 and 2024; meanwhile, the rest of the United States gained 44,272 doctors in that period, a net increase of 7.3%. 
As a result, 32 of the state’s 33 counties are designated Health Professional Shortage areas, a shortage that is only expected to worsen as aging doctors retire here. According to the presentation, New Mexico has the nation’s oldest physician workforce, 39% of whom are aged 60 or over and expected to retire in five years. 
NM lawmakers offer preview of next year’s medical malpractice legislation

Three of the doctors who presented — Lookman Lawal, Arthur Berkson and Jana Williams — are all in private practice. The fourth, John Andazola, is the chief medical officer at La Clinica de Familia, a nonprofit community health center. 
All four pointed to statewide sales taxes on medical service providers and rising medical malpractice insurance premiums as key forces driving doctors out of the state. 
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has said she will include medical malpractice reform on the agenda of the upcoming 30-day session that starts Jan. 20, and at least two lawmakers have said they intend to introduce measures addressing the issue.
The doctors issued six recommendations for reforming the state’s medical malpractice laws to attract and retain more physicians here, including capping punitive damages and attorney’s fees, as well as ending “venue shopping” by requiring medical malpractice lawsuits to be heard in the same judicial district where a medical injury occurred.
Rep. Patty Lundstrom (D-Gallup) urged her colleagues on the committee to quickly draft all of the group’s recommendations into a single piece of legislation, saying the doctors had made a compelling case with concrete solutions. 
But her colleagues, including Chair Carrie Hamblen (D-Las Cruces), noted the committee wouldn’t meet again before the session to approve a draft bill, and they said other committees might be more appropriate, including judiciary and health committees, for some of the non-tax-related provisions.
Think NM: Address medical malpractice, licensing to lessen health care worker shortage

The recommendations echo those contained in a 2024 report from Think New Mexico, a nonpartisan policy organization.
Regarding medical sales taxes, only New Mexico and Hawaii impose sales taxes on medical services, and Hawaii is rolling back those taxes beginning next year, the doctors said.  
In Doña Ana County, where the doctors all work, New Mexico gross receipts tax rates are between roughly 6% and 8.5% and apply to medical equipment, supplies and drugs, as well as co-pays and co-insurance. The tax puts a financial toll on doctors and is also complicated, Berkson said. 
The Legislature in 2025 passed a law eliminating GRT for co-insurance payments, though Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham vetoed the tax package that included the measure, saying the tax package generally did not identify ways to pay for the lost revenue from tax policy changes it enacted. 
According to Legislative Finance Committee economists, $10.5 billion spent in the healthcare sector last year generated nearly $192 million in gross receipts tax revenue for the state, as well as the gross receipt taxes on medical services generated nearly $192 million for the state and $182 million for local governments.
Faced with a growing diabetes and obesity problem at her clinic, Williams suggested the Legislature tax soda to pay for the lost medical revenue. And she urged lawmakers to not let another session pass without enacting reforms. 
“I think that the residents of New Mexico and physicians are saying, ‘Santa Fe, we have a problem,’” Williams said. “And I think we are ready to make changes, as a team, together.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_7200-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-15 19:57:53.734648

(Whitney Downard/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)In the wake of a Trump administration executive order striking state-level AI regulations, Pennsylvania will continue to prosecute its laws related to artificial intelligence in the interest of its residents, said state Attorney General Dave Sunday on Monday. 
“The reality is, the executive order is kind of vague, for lack of a better term, and we’re going to have to kind of sit back and watch and wait and see what that actually turns into in Pennsylvania,” said Sunday. 
Until a newly created federal task force took action, it would be difficult to know what the state’s response would be — though “obviously, we disagree with preempting state regulations,”  Sunday said.
States will keep pushing AI laws despite Trump’s efforts to stop them

“If there’s a statute that is attacked for its constitutionality, then we will absolutely defend it,” he said.
As attorney general, Sunday would be tasked with defending Pennsylvania’s laws in court, including the bevy of new laws and pending legislation related to AI. Many proposals have focused on notification — such as a pending bill heard in a technology committee Monday — alongside criminal offenses, including those adding AI-generated images to the definition of child sexual abuse materials. 
Sunday said he would “absolutely” recommend prosecutors continue filing those criminal charges, regardless of the executive order, related, for example, to the use of AI “deepfakes” to create pornography. 
“We think it’s critical that we have the ability to prosecute people that use this tool for terrible, horrific things that hurt people,” said Sunday. “We have to be in a position to be able to hold those bad actors accountable.”
 The executive order

President Donald Trump signed an executive order last week overriding state laws, saying a national policy needed to be crafted. The new AI Litigation Task Force could bring a legal challenge against states with AI regulations, with exceptions for child safety protections and data center infrastructure. 
In particular, Trump said AI companies needed one set of rules for approval or disapproval, rather than “50 different sources.” 
Sunday said he could “understand … the thought behind that.” 
“But, at the same time, we all have a job to do. I’m the Pennsylvania attorney general, and my job is to do everything I can to protect citizens, keep people safe, keep kids safe. So I will always argue for doing that in my job,” he said.

Earlier this month, Sunday led a bipartisan effort from 42 attorneys general to pressure leading AI companies to identify guardrails to reduce AI sycophancy — or “when an artificial intelligence model single-mindedly pursues human approval” — and delusions. 
The Dec. 9 letter urges companies to respond by Jan. 16, citing real-world deaths (including murders and suicides) as well as hospitalizations for psychosis and “other delusional spirals” tied to AI use. 
“AI can do amazing things as well, and we have to embrace that,” said Sunday. “That’s why we, as attorneys general, went directly to the companies to be able to … put us in a position where we hopefully, collaboratively, set these guardrails up.” 
Sunday said the accompanying letter wasn’t penned “in reaction to” the anticipated executive order.
 AI in the Capitol

State lawmakers, meanwhile, are considering a bill that would require health care providers and insurers to notify their customers about their use of AI, explicitly citing the lack of federal regulation as a motivator. 
“Right now, there are no real federal regulations,” Rep. Arvind Venkat (D-Allegheny), the bill’s sponsor, told the House Communications and Technology Committee Monday.
Specifically, Venkat worried about the “black box” of AI making clinical decisions that couldn’t be reproduced consistently, since the algorithms used are closely protected trade secrets.

Venkat’s House Bill 1925 got support from several stakeholders — including a representative from Sunday’s office, consumer advocates and providers — who pushed for human oversight. 
An emergency physician, like Venkat, spoke about a possible benefit of  AI. WellSpan Health’s David Vega, said that the technology presents an opportunity to “restore humanity in medicine,” citing the tendency of electronic medical health records to turn providers into “data clerks” during note taking. 
“What I see as the successful implementation of AI … it has the promise to turn our focus back to the patients. To get us to stop looking at the computer screens and, instead, spend our time talking to patients,” said Vega.
Other providers noted that the bill extends reporting requirements to third-party contractors, even though providers might not know about their AI use.
The president and CEO of the Insurance Federation of Pennsylvania, Jonathan Greer, pointed to that electronic record precedence as a reason for federal intervention in AI. Prior to a national law, states had varying requirements that were difficult for insurers to meet, he said.  
“If individual states are allowed to do it themselves, you will create friction,” Greer said. “It is made for a federal fix.” 
Committee chair Rep. Joe Ciresi (D-Montgomery) closed the meeting without a vote, but concluded by saying that “Congress has fallen behind … and it’s only going to get worse.”
“I would hope that the federal government would move but sometimes the states need to move first and make the federal government wake up and do something. Because, right now, there is a lot of willy-nilly that exists,” said Ciresi. “The federal government is lollygagging.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_8056-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-12-15 18:57:48.682398

He helped shape California politics,Ryan Sabalow,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/12/rob-reiner-political-legacy/,"Rob Reiner may be best known for his Hollywood films, but he was also a Democratic political force in California","In summary
Rob Reiner may be best known for his Hollywood films, but he was also a Democratic political force in California


The rest of the country may be remembering Hollywood legend Rob Reiner for his work in front of and behind the camera, but in California, he leaves behind a political legacy that endures beyond his famous films and movie and television roles.
Reiner, a longtime Democratic activist, donor and fundraiser, played a critical role in the legalization of same-sex marriage in California, and he was a driving force behind California’s signature early-childhood development program, First 5. 
Those who worked closely with him in state politics were shocked and heartbroken to learn that Reiner, 78, was found stabbed to death along with his wife, Michele Singer Reiner, inside their Brentwood home Sunday. 
Police investigators announced Monday that their son, Nick Reiner, 32, had been arrested and charged with their murder. Rob and Nick Reiner had once worked together on a semi-autobiographical film about Nick Reiner’s lifelong struggles with addiction.
“I can’t believe it,” former California Gov. Gray Davis told CalMatters Monday in a phone interview. “I mean, Rob and Michele have been part of Sharon and I’s life for over 30 years.” Sharon Davis is the former governor’s wife.
Davis said he’ll never forget when Rob Reiner in 1991 invited him — then California’s elected controller — to hang out on the set of Reiner’s “A Few Good Men.” Davis got to watch for hours as actors including Tom Cruise, Kevin Bacon, Demi Moore and Jack Nicholson did their scenes.“I thought: I am so proud to live in a state where quality filmmaking takes place,” Davis said. 
But a few years later, the two became something akin to coworkers. Davis was elected governor the same night in 1998 that Reiner’s Proposition 10 ballot initiative passed. The initiative created a new tax on tobacco that funded the programs for children younger than 5 that are now in every California county.
Davis said the two were at the same Election Night party in 1998 as the results came in. Davis said he and his administration later worked with Reiner to ensure the First 5 program got implemented. Davis appointed Reiner to chair the program’s California Children and Families Commission, a position he held until 2006. Reiner resigned amid allegations he was using taxpayer funds to promote his Proposition 82, an unsuccessful ballot initiative that sought to tax the wealthy to fund preschool for all children.
“Rob was not just a talker. He was a doer,” Davis said. “A lot of other people would give a nice speech, they would come to a press conference, and then they thought their job was over, and certainly we appreciate that. I mean, they have other things to do, but the difference was Rob called you up and said, ‘What can I do next?’ ”
Mike Roos, a former California legislator, political strategist and lobbyist, worked closely with Reiner on his Prop. 10 campaign.  He said the two men got to know each other and it was clear to Roos that Reiner loved his children dearly.“This has been just one of the most horrible things I could ever imagine, knowing him and knowing his love and the investment that he made in every one of those kids in that family,” Roos said, “but particularly how he cared and talked so thoughtfully about the struggles that Nick had in that period of time when I knew him.”

Later, Reiner would help found the American Foundation for Equal Rights. The group paid for the legal fight against Proposition 8, the 2008 ballot measure that banned same-sex marriage in California. The U.S. Supreme Court overturned Prop. 8 in 2013. 
Kris Perry, the former executive director of First 5 and a lead plaintiff in the case that got Prop. 8 overturned, said Rob and Michele Reiner also stood by her and her wife, Sandy Stier, as they and the other plaintiffs defended their right to marry in the landmark case. 
“They continued over a five-year period to champion the cause by speaking out themselves, bringing more support to the case, doing media interviews, and, more importantly, being kind and generous …. year after year after year,” Perry said. “They cared about us as people throughout that entire process. They left this indelible impression on all of us of what it means to be a real leader, to not only make something possible, but to stand beside people during the fight.”
She said Reiner wasn’t just a figurehead at First 5, either. He attended Children and Families Commission meetings every month and was deeply involved in discussions of “how to invest, where to get results, how to hold people accountable,” she said.
Gov. Gavin Newsom over the weekend said Reiner’s impressive body of professional work, which included “When Harry Met Sally,” “Stand By Me” and “The Princess Bride,” taught “generations how to see goodness and righteousness in others — and (encouraged) us to dream bigger.”“That empathy extended well beyond his films,” Newsom said in a statement. “He made California a better place through his good works. Rob will be remembered for his remarkable filmography and for his extraordinary contribution to humanity.”
The Reiners donated about $2.7 million to help Democrats over their lifetime, The New York Times reported, including $100,000 to support then-President Joe Biden’s 2024 re-election. He later joined actor George Clooney in urging Biden to drop out, saying “We need someone younger to fight back.”
Not everyone had nice things to say about Reiner. President Donald Trump, whom Reiner frequently criticized, called Reiner a “tortured and struggling but once very talented movie director and comedy star” in a social media post. He suggested that Reiner’s death was linked to a “mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME.” 
Democratic U.S Rep. Laura Friedman, who represents the Hollywood area, said in an interview she “really felt sick over seeing Donald Trump’s post about this terrible murder.” 
Friedman, a former film and television producer, said Reiner’s art reflected his politics. She said he advocated for being decent to each other and against bigotry — unlike Trump who she said has a “unique ability to divide Americans and make people angry.”
Reiner, she said, often used humor to “bring us together … and do it in a way that was somehow gentle and loving at the same time.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/121525-Rob-Reiner-KD-Getty-02-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C720&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-15 18:57:48.682398

(Photo by Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)A school accountability board on Monday rejected a legislative committee’s earlier decision to waive penalties for schools that had too much cash saved up, prolonging a standoff that board members don’t yet know how to resolve.
In November, the South Dakota School Finance Accountability Board recommended partial waivers for the Frederick Area and Miller school districts, both with fiscal penalties of 10% of the districts’ excess cash balances. The balances are limited by state law.
But lawmakers on the Legislature’s budget committee rejected the recommendations earlier this month. Instead, the committee suggested the board issue a full waiver to the school districts.
The 10% fiscal penalty for Frederick would be a $9,265 reduction in general state aid for the 2026 fiscal year. Miller’s penalty would be a $7,474 reduction.
State budget chief urges close look at schools with excess cash as property tax complaints continue

Board member and Bureau of Finance and Management Commissioner Jim Terwilliger said he understands where the legislative committee “is coming from,” but he’s “sticking to my principles.”
“We as a board recommended these,” Terwilliger said, adding that the board could have implemented the full penalty but chose a more “lenient” penalty.
Terwilliger and other board members were unsure how to resolve their disagreement with the legislative committee, because an applicable administrative rule and law aren’t “super clear,” Terwilliger said. A representative with the state Department of Education said its legal department will review the situation.
Terwilliger, at the board’s November meeting, urged a closer look at cash balances in some school districts as the state considers property tax relief. Schools are the leading recipients of property tax revenue.
Board members approved lawmakers’ suggestion to conduct a financial review of the Agar-Blunt-Onida School District. The district does not receiving any state funding, because it has enough local and other funding. That means a financial penalty cannot be imposed.
Lawmakers suggested the review partly because the school district has appeared before the accountability board four times in five years.

HATTIESBURG – Brand new Southern Miss head football coach Blake Anderson, introduced to a ballroom-full of enthused Golden Eagle fans here Monday afternoon, faces extremely difficult tasks, both immediate and long-term.
The immediate: His Eagles, who lost three of their final four regular season games, have little more than a week to prepare a date with the Western Kentucky Hilltoppers in the Dec. 23 New Orleans Bowl. 
Rick Cleveland
Long-term: As it stands now, Anderson must replace 32 seniors – including 18 of 22 starters – before the 2026 season in which USM faces Auburn and Tulane in September road games. 
The good news at Southern Miss: Anderson, a 56-year-old Texan, has been there and done that before. What’s more, he has done it twice. Athletic director Jeremy McClain was absolutely correct when he called Anderson “the most accomplished head football coach we’ve ever hired at Southern Miss.”
And, yes, that includes Charles Huff, who recently departed Hattiesburg for Memphis. Huff had won one NCAA Division I conference championship before taking the job here. Anderson has won three.
“I am the right guy for this job,” Anderson said. “I am supposed to be here, We will not waste this opportunity.”
For the most successful coaches in Southern Miss history – Thad “Pie” Vann, Bobby Collins and Jeff Bower – the job here was their first crack at being a head coach. Anderson has 10 seasons as a Division I head coach under his belt – seven at Arkansas State and three at Utah State. Nine of those 10 seasons ended with bowl games. Three ended with conference championships.
The first goal for any Southern Miss coach is to win the Sun Belt Conference championship. Anderson, at Arkansas State, already has won two, plus another division championship. He also won the Mountain West Conference championship at Utah State. 
Dive deeper his two previous head coaching jobs and you find in each case Anderson inherited less than ideal situations. Arkansas State had five coaches in the previous five seasons before Anderson took over. In his second year there, Anderson won nine games and the Sun Belt title.
At Utah State, Anderson produced one of the most dramatic turn-arounds in college football history. He inherited a team that had won one game the previous season. Anderson’s first Utah State team won 11 games, including a 24-23 win over Oregon State in the LA Bowl.
Anderson was no stranger to Southern Miss when he joined Huff’s staff as offensive coordinator before this past season. He had served four seasons (2008-2011) as first the quarterbacks coach and the offensive coordinator. In fact, he was the play-caller on the last Southern Miss team to win a conference title in 2011, serving under Larry Fedora. Those Golden Eagles won a school-record 12 games, averaged 36 points a game and stunned undefeated and seventh-ranked Houston at Houston 49-28 for the Conference USA championship. That Houston team would go on to trounce Penn State in the Cotton Bowl. That USM team would beat Nevada in the Hawaii Bowl.
Those four previous years in Hattiesburg were a primary reason Anderson joined Huff’s staff last year, he said. “There’s a sense of family here that you don’t have everywhere,” Anderson said. “This is a place I loved and really enjoyed my time here.”
Anderson said he has learned from his two Hattiesburg experiences, both under Fedora and Huff. Indeed, he had nothing but praise for Huff. He called Huff as “meticulous and detail-oriented” as anyone he had ever been around and added, “I wouldn’t be surprised to see him coaching for a national championship somewhere down the line.”
As for Anderson, 24 hours in a day aren’t enough currently, between recruiting, hiring assistants, preparing for a bowl game and getting ready for the two-week transfer portal window that begins Jan. 2. He talked like a man who relishes the task.
“Nobody is gonna out-work us, I promise,” he said. “I’ve done this before.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/15165507/Blake-Anderson-USM.jpg,,,2025-12-15 18:57:48.682398

(Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer.)Hennepin County paid around $370,000 to cover back wages and benefits for more than 100 contracted security guards after conducting an investigation into alleged wage theft by Black Knight Protection Agency and finding itself partly responsible.
Hennepin County sets minimum prevailing wages for contracted security guards, custodians and maintenance workers — much like the state and federal governments do for public infrastructure projects — and regularly updates those rates based on the labor market.
Black Knight Protection Agency initially paid the correct prevailing wage of $24.62 per hour in wages and benefits as required by the county when it was hired to provide security services at libraries and other county buildings in August 2021.
But when the county increased the hourly wage and benefits rate in May 2024, the county never told Black Knight Protection Agency owner David Junior he needed to pay his workers $28.72 per hour in wages and benefits, following years of rapid inflation.
“We weren’t aware of it, but if we would have been, we would have also got our own increase as a company,” Junior said in an interview with the Reformer. “I would never steal. We’re in security. That’s the total opposite of what we do.”
For more than a year, Junior submitted payroll records to the county showing he was paying workers the old prevailing wage, and the county continued paying him the old reimbursement rate.
The underpayments were uncovered by SEIU Local 26, a union that represents thousands of Twin Cities security guards and janitors, though notably not Black Knight workers.
The union then alerted the county, local prosecutors and the press to the shortfalls, which prompted county officials to open investigations into potential wage theft.
“We never had a problem like this for years when these were union contractors,” Brahim Kone, secretary-treasurer of SEIU Local 26, said in a statement. “We are glad these workers are getting the money they were due, but know that this situation happens all too often to working people.”
The union is pushing for the county to adopt a “responsible contractor” policy to prevent workers from being shorted wages in the future.
In a memo to county commissioners in August, Deputy County Administrator Dan Rogan explained the county failed to attach a document listing the new prevailing wage in an updated contract with Black Knight and did not enter the new rate into the county system for tracking compliance. He said in the memo they are now reviewing their contracting procedures.
Junior said he appreciates the county taking responsibility but lamented that his business’s reputation took a hit from being accused of wage theft.
“I didn’t even get the benefit of the doubt,” Junior said. “We took the blunt of the gossip and rumoring.”
Junior said he has been able to pay back wages to around 75 workers and is still trying to get ahold of around 30 more.
Hennepin County ended its contract with Black Knight in August. A spokesman said the new firm, Unparalleled Security, was selected after a competitive bidding process.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/P1023761-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-15 18:57:48.682398

It was a joint venture between Ford Motor Co. and South Korea-based company SK On. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Austin Anthony)Ford Motor Co. will lay off about 1,500 workers in Kentucky as it converts a ballyhooed plant in Hardin County from making batteries for electric vehicles to making batteries for a new energy storage business. 
Ford on Monday also announced that it is taking a $19.5 billion writedown and canceling several electric vehicle models in the face of Trump administration policies and lackluster demand for electric vehicles.
 In a press release, the company said the conversion of the Glendale plant, which began operations in August, would “serve the rapidly growing battery energy storage systems market” by leveraging “currently underutilized electric vehicle battery capacity to create a new, diversified and profitable revenue stream for Ford.” The company said it would invest $2 billion over two years to scale the energy storage business and deploy at least 20 gigawatt-hours annually of energy storage batteries by late 2027. 
“Ford plans to produce LFP prismatic cells, battery energy storage system modules and 20-foot DC container systems at this facility. These systems are at the heart of the energy storage solution market for data centers, utilities, and large-scale industrial and commercial customers,” the company wrote in its press release.
The Louisville Courier-Journal reported that Ford executive Andrew Frick said the BlueOval SK battery plant is expected to lay off all of its approximately 1,500 employees in the near future, though the final date of employment has not been announced. The newspaper reported the retooled plant would employ 2,100 workers with some currently employed workers anticipated to reapply.
Workers at the battery plant had sought to unionize with the United Auto Workers, with the results of an union election held in August still being contested before the National Labor Relations Council.
Ford said production of a previously announced electric truck and universal electric vehicle platform to be built in Louisville continues to progress with production set to start in 2027.
The battery plant located on Interstate 65 in Glendale, was previously a joint venture between Ford and South Korea-based SK On. The companies announced last week they were ending the partnership. 
Originally planned to be two plants with billions of dollars of cumulative investment, the companies announced in 2023 that the second plant would be indefinitely idled due in part to softening electric vehicle demand. 
Republican lawmakers in the Kentucky legislature who represent Hardin County issued statements expressing both optimism and caution about the announced conversion. 
State Reps. Samara Heavrin, R-Leitchfield, and Steve Bratcher, R-Elizabethtown, in a joint statement said their focus remained “on making sure the men and women whose jobs are impacted by this decision have the support and resources they need to find new employment and that going forward this new project delivers real, lasting investment and meaningful employment for the families and communities surrounding Glendale.” 
“We are optimistic about Ford Motor Company’s decision to take over the Glendale facility and transition the project toward energy storage, particularly as initial plans for the project have faced significant challenges from the outset. At the same time, optimism must be matched with both caution and accountability, and we will be watching closely to ensure commitments are met and honored,” the two Republicans said in their statement. 
State Sen. Matt Deneen, R-Elizabethtown, in a statement said there would be “short-term challenges” but that Ford’s investment in Glendale “underscores the company’s long-term commitment to this community.”
Democratic Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear previously blamed Republicans in Washington for federal policies that jeopardized the EV battery plant. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act ended a $7,500 tax credit for the purchase of electric vehicles, and the Trump administration has targeted Biden administration regulations that sought to encourage the production of electric vehicles.

(Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The Nebraska Investment Finance Authority took first steps Friday toward administering housing programs currently operated by the state Department of Economic Development.
The state housing group unanimously adopted a resolution letting DED transfer administrative power over its housing programs to the state agency in charge of helping low- and moderate-income homebuyers finance purchases, though no transfer has yet taken place.
NIFA Executive Director Shannon Harner said the resolution essentially just says the agency is open to accepting DED housing programs.
DED manages a collection of housing programs, some of which are funded through the state and others federally. Harner said state-funded programs would require legislative approval before they can be transferred to NIFA. NIFA spokeswoman Elizabeth Fimbres said the agency already administers the state’s Low Income Housing Tax Credit program.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
It’s unclear how many housing programs the move might impact. Justin Pinkerman, a DED spokesperson, declined to answer how many programs the department is considering transferring.
The decision comes as DED’s total workforce has significantly shrunk. No fewer than 22 employees have exited the department between September and November.
Pinkerman confirmed that DED’s housing director also resigned last week, although he said the departure did not play a role in the NIFA resolution.
Pinkerman declined to answer how transferring programs to NIFA might impact DED’s remaining housing staff. When asked why DED was considering the move, he said DED has collaborated with NIFA for some time to increase the availability of affordable housing.
“We are pleased that Nebraska has been recognized as a top state for homebuilding and housing affordability,” Pinkerman said in an email. “Together, our agencies are considering administrative arrangements that will most effectively build on this success.”

Trump’s shocking suggestion that the killings of Rob and Michele Reiner were a consequence of the director’s opposition to Trump.
The couple’s long-troubled son has been arrested in the deaths, but Trump wrote on Truth Social that Rob Reiner’s death was “reportedly due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME.”
The post prompted a flurry of critical replies, many from his self-described supporters and others from Democrats, including U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy and U.S. Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut.
“He’s just lost it. Now saying Rob and Michele Reiner caused their own murder because they didn’t support him,” Murphy wrote. “So sick.”

Himes confined himself to reposting U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the one-time MAGA Republican, noting that re-tweet was “first time ever.”
“This is a family tragedy, not about politics or political enemies,” she wrote. “Many families deal with a family member with drug addiction and mental health issues. It’s incredibly difficult and should be met with empathy especially when it ends in murder.”
More noteworthy were the string of replies from Trump’s supporters. Mixed in with 29,000 “likes” were numerous replies rebuking him.
“Sir, Mr. President…I love you. I support you 100%. I DO NOT SUPPORT THIS POST! Highly inappropriate, and it puts us in their box. Tacky and tasteless.” 
“Terrible response to this tragedy. Unbecoming of the Office of the President. I voted for you three times but this is beyond the pale.”
“As a MAGA I have tried my best to support every step of the way but not this time. EVERY human, I reapeat EVERY human deserves respect during something like this. I am ashamed that you posted that. You must humble yourself and ask for forgiveness in what was a very HUGE lapse in judgement.”
“ooh, sir, please take this down.”
Others noted that Reiner had reacted with empathy at the assassination of Charlie Kirk, the conservative commentator.

Klein was joined at the news conference by, from left, John Lyman, president of the Columbia Board of Education, Erica Dickson and Suzette Waters, board members (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).Missouri’s fourth-largest school district sued the state Monday to prevent establishment of a new charter school in Boone County.
Columbia Public Schools wants the courts to declare a law passed in 2024 unconstitutional, arguing that it is a local law for one county masquerading as a general law for the entire state.
The district waited to file the lawsuit until Frontier Schools, a Kansas City-based charter operator, applied to the State Board of Education because it represents a threat to the district’s financial health, district leaders said at a news conference.
“These actions are about protecting constitutional principles and ensuring the public education decisions in Boone County are made by people who are accountable to the voters and the families that live here,” said John Lyman, president of the Columbia Board of Education.
The district alleges that the law allowing a charter school in Boone County was passed without the proper notification required by the Missouri Constitution for “local or special laws.” In addition to overturning the law, the lawsuit asks the court to prevent the state board from voting on the application while the lawsuit is pending.
In a message to parents explaining why the district filed the lawsuit, the board insisted it did not oppose the concept of school choice for parents.
“Parents can choose now to send their children to a private or parochial school, and there are scholarships for families in need,” the message stated. “Public education exists to serve all children and charters simply do not.”
Caleb Rowden pushes for charter schools in his county over objections from local districts

Along with suing to overturn the law, the district sent a letter signed by all seven local board members to the state board asking them to reject the Frontier application.
To open in the fall of 2026, Frontier would require approval of its application by Jan. 31. The board is scheduled to meet Jan. 14 and 15, but no agenda has been posted. 
If the Jan. 31 deadline is missed, Frontier will aim to open in 2027, spokeswoman Jennifer Gray said in an email to The Independent.
The timing for board consideration is uncertain because the application is under review, said Lucas Bond, spokesman for the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. 
Bond declined to comment on the lawsuit.
Prior to 2024, state law allowed charter schools in Kansas City, St. Louis, unaccredited districts and by sponsorship of the local school board.
The 2024 law made no reference to the need to address educational, administrative or statewide needs by allowing charters to open Boone County, the lawsuit states. Instead, it is an unconstitutional local law, it states, because it uses a population definition for the county — more than 150,000 people and fewer than 200,000 — to say where charters would be allowed.
The Constitution says no such law can be passed without published notice 30 days before it is filed, the lawsuit alleges.
“The state cannot avoid these constitutional obligations by disguising a one-county law behind a pretextual temporary population bracket,” the lawsuit states.\

The Senate’s top leader in 2024, then-President Pro Tem Caleb Rowden, a Columbia Republican, inserted the provision in a wide-ranging education bill over objections of local education leaders. 
State Sen. Stephen Webber, a Columbia Democrat who succeeded Rowden in the district, has, for the second year, filed a bill to repeal the charter law provision for Boone County.
There are two charter schools under discussion for Boone County but only Frontier has submitted an application. Frontier, which operates four schools in Kansas City, is asking the state board to approve an elementary charter school focused on science, technology, engineering and math, or STEM, education. 
The application anticipates enrolling 184 students in grades pre-K through second grade in its first year, growing to 584 and educating students through the fifth grade by the fifth year of operation.
The application states that the demand for the school is based on the evidence of interest found in “national and regional research.”
For Columbia, “the combination of population growth, rising early childhood enrollment, and limited STEM-intensive options in the public elementary system creates a strong market.”
The district already operates one STEM-focused elementary school, with an enrollment of about 220, and provides several STEM enrichment programs including the Boone County Nature School operated in partnership with the Missouri Department of Conservation.
With 18,034 students, Columbia is behind only Springfield, North Kansas City and Rockwood School District in St. Louis County in total enrollment. 
In the letter to the state board, Columbia board members targeted what they say is evidence of a cut-and-paste approach for stating the achievement goals of the proposed school. Frontier’s application states that “the Performance Contract (with sponsor St. Louis University) requires that academic goals meet or exceed the aggregated pupil performance of Kansas City Public Schools.”

That shows Frontier is a franchise education program seeking to syphon state and local tax money away from public schools, board member Suzette Waters said at the news conference.
“We do not believe our community is interested in a fast-food-style education for our children,” Waters said. “Truly the best way to know if there is public interest in a charter school in Boone County is to let citizens vote on it.”
Columbia Superintendent Jeff Klein said the charter, if approved, would divert about $4 million of state and local tax money away from the district in the first year and $9 million a year if it meets enrollment goals. The district has a $433 million annual budget, but the reduction in student numbers would not be concentrated, so costs would not change.
Frontier has done no community meetings to measure support and shown no reason why the district is not performing, Klein said.
“Our district already provides quality, choice, innovation and proven outcomes within a system that is fully accredited, fiscally responsible and deeply connected to its community,” he said.
Frontier defended its application, and the need for its school in Columbia, in written responses to questions from The Independent.
The school would comply with state law on its attendance area, support students with special education needs and contribute to educating Columbia’s growing population, the answers stated.
Community meetings will be held after the application is approved to explain the program and attract enrollment, Frontier stated. 
“Frontier would engage more directly with families, community members, and local stakeholders to share detailed information about the school and to better understand community interest and needs,” the statement read.
A community youth training and employment organization, Job Point, was the first to announce plans for a charter school in Columbia but the organization has not followed through with a formal application.
The district has consulted with Job Point on how its program can work with the district, Klein said. He said he does not expect the organization to follow through.
“We intend to oppose the establishment of charter schools in Boone County,” Klein said, “as long as we perceive it is not consistent with the will of the community or the interests of the community.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/CPS-news-conference-20251215-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-12-15 18:57:48.682398

Attorney Daniel Buller, representing […]","The Kansas Supreme Court is considering complex legal arguments about whether Hays and Russell can divert aquifer water from Edwards County to supplement its own supply despite attempts by rural agricultural irrigators to block the pipeline project. The cities want to begin drawing on water rights purchased in the 1990s. (Submitted)TOPEKA — The Kansas Supreme Court endured a crossfire of claims and counterclaims Monday about whether an association of Edwards County irrigators can try to thwart plans by Hays and Russell to make use of water rights acquired decades ago to pipe water drawn from a rural aquifer to the cities.
Attorney Daniel Buller, representing the two cities, urged members of the Supreme Court to view the protracted legal battle through the lens of state law. He said transferring a large amount of water from an aquifer by pipeline to the cities rather than using the resource to grow crops was acceptable under the black-and-white text of Kansas statute.
He made the point by delving into a section of law declaring “nothing herein shall be construed to prevent the granting of applications because the proposed diversion may cause the water level to be lowered at the point of diversion.”
Kansas Department of Agriculture lawyer Stephanie Kramer as well as attorney Charles Lee, who represented the group of crop irrigators who filed a lawsuit to challenge the project, added their own insights to a case tied to the holy-grail subject of individual water rights in Kansas.
The litigation recognized the growing risk in Kansas, amid evidence of climate change, of relying heavily on slow-to-recharge aquifers to run crop irrigation systems to artificially inflate corn, wheat and soybean yields. The case highlighted the challenge of cities with less-reliable rainfall that want to anchor economic expansion to availability of water. It demonstrated the difficulty of state regulators striving to harmonize statute, regulation and court precedent.
Buller said common sense as well as state law recognized use of a water right would lower the level in an aquifer. In a lower court proceeding, he said, opponents of the water infrastructure project sought by his clients in Hays and Russell offered testimony that indicated the cost of the cities’ withdrawal of water was unlikely to raise operating costs of agriculture users in the county for at least 50 years.
“In this case, they’ve not alleged that another water right cannot be satisfied,” Buller said. “Without that, there is no impairment.”
Lee, representing irrigators who formed the Water Protection Association of Central Kansas, said the so-called WaterPACK opposed the project contemplated by Hays and Russell. The Edwards County Commission took specific action to block diversion of water to the two cities.
Lee said existing law and regulation was sufficient rationale for the Supreme Court to dismiss the Department of Agriculture water resource chief engineer’s “master order” allowing Hays and Russell to begin work to funnel water to both cities from their 7,000-acre R9 Ranch in Edwards County.
He argued the net result of the cities’ plan to consume water approximately 80 miles from wells in Edwards County would reduce recharge of the aquifer. The conversion of the ranch from crop to grassland use would cut the volume of moisture redeposited in the aquifer, he said.
WaterPACK claimed Hays and Russell would ultimately slash the aquifer level, increase well pumping costs, shrink crop yields and upset the county’s quality of life. An estimated 85% of water diverted from ground and surface water sources in Kansas was used for agriculture, including irrigation.
Lee said Department of Agriculture engineer Earl Lewis’ order would systematically replace statutory and regulatory requirements relative to water use with standards invented by the agency. He said the chief engineer’s order should be vacated by the Supreme Court.
“The master order authorizing the cities’ water transfer ignores reality and bypasses critical regulatory safeguards,” Lee said during oral argument Monday before the state Supreme Court. “By doing so, it threatens the long term viability of the aquifer and the property rights of WaterPACK members.”
The legal triangle was completed by Kramer, who addressed the Supreme Court in defense of the order issued by Lewis. She said WaterPACK lacked standing as an association to challenge to state engineer’s order. She said WaterPACK failed to demonstrate harm in the sense Edwards County irrigators would not be able to fulfill their water rights if Hays and Russell began pumping from the R9 Ranch. WaterPACK’s claims were the stuff of fiction, she said.
“WaterPACK has failed to allege that harm to its members will be caused by the approval of these change applications because it seeks to impose impairment and consumptive use standards that simply don’t exist,” she said.
Six justices of the state Supreme Court — minus Chief Justice Marla Luckert still recovering from a stroke in October — were called upon to read a pile of district court records and appellate briefs and listen to oral argument in an attempt to sort out the tangled perspectives and issue an opinion.
In the mid-1990s, Hays and Russell purchased the R9 Ranch and 32 water rights in Edwards County for the purpose of eventually building a pipeline to supply the drought-prone cities adjacent to Interstate 70. City officials requested permission about 10 years ago to change the ranch’s water use designation from irrigation to municipal. At the Department of Agriculture, Lewis approved the request.
Irrigators in Edwards County filed suit because they were concerned Hays and Russell would take too much water from agricultural pursuits. In 2024, Edwards County revised zoning regulations to block the water transfer. Hays and Russell characterized the zoning adjustments were unconstitutional.
The dispute began in district court, bounced to the state Supreme Court, returned to district court and found its way back to the Supreme Court.
During oral argument on Monday, Justice Dan Biles raised questions of WaterPACK’s claim the city water project would impair irrigators in the association. Justice Melissa Taylor Standridge sought explanation of whether attorneys believed the association had standing to bring the lawsuit.
Justice Eric Rosen, who performed duties of managing oral arguments normally left to Luckert, questioned whether issues raised on appeal were properly considered in district court.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Kansas-Supeme-Court-new-1024x819.jpg,,,2025-12-15 18:57:48.682398

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)A number of youth involved in the historic Held v. Montana climate lawsuit are returning to court, alleging a number of laws passed by the 2025 Legislature violate their constitutional right to a clean and healthful environment. 
The new petition, filed directly with the Montana Supreme Court last week against the state, Gov. Greg Gianforte, and the Department of Environmental Quality, seeks to overturn three laws passed earlier this year — House Bills 285 and 291, as well as Senate Bill 221  — which came about as a direct response to the state’s highest court upholding the young plaintiff’s victory last year. 
“Montana’s leaders are openly defying the Constitution and the Supreme Court,” said Nate Bellinger, lead attorney for the plaintiffs, in a press release. “Held made clear that these youth are being harmed now and that Montana has a constitutional duty to protect them. Instead, lawmakers passed laws with the explicit intent to undermine the court’s ruling.”
But in a statement to the Daily Montanan, Speaker of the House Brandon Ler said the “activists are using the courts to achieve outcomes they cannot win through the legislative process,” undermining the separation of powers in Montana. 
In 2023, a district court judge ruled the state could not limit the analysis of greenhouse gas emissions during the environmental review process, affirmed the youth plaintiffs have a “fundamental constitutional right to a clean and healthful environment, and rolled back two laws challenging the Montana Environmental Policy Act. 
Following December’s Supreme Court ruling upholding that decision, Republicans brought a suite of bills aimed at addressing the Held decision by altering MEPA and the Montana Clean Air Act. 
“In the Held v. Montana court case, they tried to twist MEPA into something it was never meant to be — a tool to deny permits and block development,” said Ler, R-Savage, said during a signing ceremony for five of the bills. 
Ler sponsored House Bill 285, which passed along party lines. He said it was designed to provide clarity and efficiency to MEPA. 
While the law adds a mechanism for agencies to conduct greenhouse gas analysis of proposed actions, it emphasizes MEPA is a tool for assessing environmental impacts without regulatory teeth. 
It specifically states that “An agency may not withhold, deny, or impose conditions on any permit or other authority to act,” based on MEPA. 
The Held litigants argue the change effectively “blinded” state agencies, such as as the Montana Department of Environmental Quality, by prohibiting the use of information gathered during MEPA reviews to alter a permit, even if the environmental impacts could be a violation of the state constitution. 
“The laws unconstitutionally eliminate a means to prevent harms from happening before they occur,” the petition states. 
Senate Bill 221, brought by Sen. Wylie Galt, R-Martinsdale, also changed MEPA by narrowing the scope of review to “proximate” environmental impacts and defining a “proposed action” as excluding “upstream, downstream, or other indirect action that occurs independently or is caused in part or exclusively by the proposed action.”
“Such restrictions on the scope of environmental reviews under MEPA require agencies to turn a blind eye to known environmental harms caused by fossil fuel projects and (greenhouse gas) emissions,” the petition states. 
A third challenged law, HB 291, brought by Rep. Greg Oblander, R-Billings, prohibits the state from adopting more stringent standards for air pollutants than the federal government.
The petition argues the provision turns the floor of the federal Clean Air Act regulations “into a ceiling,” and prevents the DEQ from exercising broad authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.
“Federal air pollution standards tell Montana’s agencies little to nothing about the impact of (greenhouse gas) emissions on Montana’s environment,” the petition argues. 
The thirteen plaintiffs in the suit, ages 15 to 24, were all involved in Held vs. Montana. 
“I love Montana, which is why I am taking action again to protect my home and its people,” Rikki Held said. “The Montana Supreme Court has already affirmed that we have a constitutional right to a clean and healthful environment, including a stable climate system, and the facts show we are being harmed right now, yet the state just passed new laws that make these harms worse. We are breathing polluted air, losing access to the lands and waters that sustain us, and confronting heat, wildfires, and climate impacts that endanger our health, our lives, and our futures.”
The petition is requesting the state Supreme Court take up the case as an original proceeding focused on legal questions, as the scientific record of the effects of fossil fuels on the climate and Montana youth was established in Held vs. Montana during a district court trial. 
A spokesperson for the governor’s office did not respond to questions from the Daily Montanan by publication.

(Joshua Bowling/Source NM) New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez on Monday announced the creation of a “Crime Gun Intelligence Center” that will help local police departments and sheriffs’ offices across the state analyze data from firearms and spent casings found at crime scenes to identify repeat offenders and gun traffickers.
The initiative has been on Torrez’s to-do list since winning election in 2022, he said, and he credited New Mexico Democratic U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich for securing the federal funding needed to make it happen. In addition to housing a small team of analysts within his New Mexico Department of Justice, Torrez also installed machines that can analyze shell casings, recovered firearms and more within four local law enforcement agencies: the Gallup and Roswell police departments, along with the San Juan and Doña Ana county sheriff’s offices.
The machines compile images of ammunition casings in the National Integrated Ballistic Information Network and let analysts compare them to other entries for potential matches, much like the federal fingerprint database. Torrez’s intention is that the agencies with the machines can become hubs for rural New Mexico, as previously the Albuquerque Police Department had the most advanced NIBIN machine in the state, requiring officers from rural departments to drive several hours to use it.
“It really does enhance public safety, not only in our ability to more quickly solve these problems and understand trafficking patterns, but it also keeps police officers in their communities,” Torrez said Monday. “We shouldn’t have sheriffs’ deputies and police officers from smaller departments being forced to drive into our larger cities to take advantage of this technology.”
New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez was joined on Dec. 15, 2025, by Roswell Police Chief Lance Bateman, San Juan County Sheriff Shane Ferrari and Gallup Police Chief Erin Toadlena-Pablo to announce the creation of the Crime Gun Intelligence Center. (Joshua Bowling/Source NM)
The new system starts at the crime scene. Officers gather any physical evidence, like shell casings that are left over when someone fires a gun, and enter detailed photos of them to the NIBIN network. Then, the network examines the photos and evaluates the thousands of other entries for possible matches, which it then sends to Torrez’s Crime Gun Intelligence Center. Analysts there will review anything the system flagged as a potential match, and then send those leads onto local detectives.
Nationally, gunfire has for years been the leading cause of death for children and teenagers. New Mexico’s firearm mortality rate of 25.3 deaths per 100,000 people is nearly double the national rate, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
In Albuquerque, this technology has played a key role in solving two of the city’s most high-profile shootings in recent years. Officials with the New Mexico Department of Justice said that analysts’ work of reviewing shell casings helped lead to arrests in the 2022 case of a man accused of targeting and killing Muslims, as well as in the case of failed GOP candidate Solomon Peña, who was convicted in August of orchestrating drive-by shootings at the homes of prominent New Mexico Democrats. 
Torrez said he hopes to further expand this system into northeastern New Mexico and wants the New Mexico Department of Public Safety in Santa Fe to sign an agreement that would bring its existing NIBIN machine into the new statewide initiative. 
“Every time we take a crime gun off the street, we’re stopping a future shooting,” said NMDOJ Special Investigations Bureau Director Kyle Hartsock. When he began his career in law enforcement 20 years ago, he said, it was common practice to “shrug your shoulders” and discard shell casings once a crime was adjudicated.
But officials on Monday said that holding onto images of those casings has proved an invaluable practice to identify gun trafficking patterns.
Finding spent casings from a gun crime in Farmington and matching them to a previously logged crime in another city, such as Albuquerque, can help police identify trafficking across the state and the nation, law enforcement officials said. Recently, both Republicans and Democrats in the state Legislature called on Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham to put public safety on the upcoming legislative session’s agenda, citing a “crime epidemic” and a new analysis of federal data that found an outsized gun trafficking problem in New Mexico.
“Violent crime does not stop at the city limits,” San Juan County Sheriff Shane Ferrari said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/CGIC6-1024x772.jpg,,,2025-12-15 17:56:42.767638

Girls high school basketball has started and with two weeks of the season already in the rearview mirror, let’s take a look at some of what happened in last week’s games around the state. 
 
Sanford’s Defense powers Warriors to 2-0 start
The Warriors are undefeated two games into the year with dominant performances on both ends of the court. Through their first two games, the Warriors have scored 158 points and only allowed their opponents to score 29. Sanford played its first two games of the season back-to-back last Thursday and Friday defeating St. Andrew’s and Tower Hill. Tower Hill was the 14th seed in last year’s state tournament in which Sanford made a run to the semifinals. The Warriors are scheduled to play DMA this Friday followed by a game against Union Catholic High School in New Jersey on Sunday. 
Spartans Win Three to Begin the Season
St. Mark’s won its first two games of the season at the AI duPont Tip-Off Tournament defeating AI duPont High School in its first game and Tatnall in the second. The Spartans only had one matchup last week, defeating Conrad in a close game. The Spartans have received key contributions from sophomore Natalie VanDzura and senior Madiella Keefer. Keefer led the Spartans in scoring in two of their three games and VanDzura scored a season high 27 points in the team’s first game. St. Mark’s has two games scheduled this week. Monday night the Spartans will play Odessa at home and on Friday St. Mark’s will travel to Appoquinimink for a road game against the Jaguars.
Delaware Military Academy Starts New Season with Undefeated Start
DMA is 3-0 this season after finishing last season in the quarterfinals of the state tournament. The Seahawks entered this season without their top two scorers from a year ago, but haven’t missed a beat, defeating Christiana High School last week to stay undefeated on the new season. Four Seahawk players scored double digit points in the win and combined for 18 steals on the defensive end of the court. DMA is scheduled to play Concord High School on Wednesday and Sanford on Friday. 
Cape Henlopen Begins Season with Undefeated Week
The Vikings officially started their season last week with a road victory over Smyrna High School on Tuesday and then followed that with a pair of victories over the weekend against Sussex Central and Haverford High School in Pennsylvania. The Vikings returned eight players from their tournament run a year ago where they lost in the second round to Sanford. Senior Amalia Fruchtman is one of the eight returning players and leads the Vikings in scoring through their first three games of the season. Fruchtman has scored double digit points in each game thus far. Cape Henlopen will play two games this week starting with a matchup against Dover High School on Monday and a game against Stephen Decatur High School from Maryland on Thursday.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Gemini_Generated_Image_fki0hwfki0hwfki0.png,,,2025-12-15 17:56:42.767638

(AP) — “Christmas at Pemberley Manor” and “Romance at Reindeer Lodge” may never make it to Oscar night, but legions of fans still love these sweet-yet-predictable holiday movies — and this season, many are making pilgrimages to where their favorite scenes were filmed.
That’s because Connecticut — the location for at least 22 holiday films by Hallmark, Lifetime and others — is promoting tours of the quaint Christmas-card cities and towns featured in this booming movie market; places where a busy corporate lawyer can return home for the holidays and cross paths with a plaid shirt-clad former high school flame who now runs a Christmas tree farm. (Spoiler alert: they live happily ever after.)
“It’s exciting — just to know that something was in a movie and we actually get to see it visually,” said Abby Rumfelt of Morganton, North Carolina, after stepping off a coach bus in Wethersfield, Connecticut, at one of the stops on the holiday movie tour.
Rumfelt was among 53 people, mostly women, on a recent weeklong “Hallmark Movie Christmas Tour,” organized by Mayfield Tours from Spartanburg, South Carolina. On the bus, fans watched the matching movies as they rode from stop to stop.
To plan the tour, co-owner Debbie Mayfield used the “ Connecticut Christmas Movie Trail ” map, which was launched by the wintry New England state last year to cash in on the growing Christmas-movie craze.
Mayfield, who co-owns the company with her husband, Ken, said this was their first Christmas tour to holiday movie locations in Connecticut and other Northeastern states. It included hotel accommodations, some meals, tickets and even a stop to see the Rockettes in New York City. It sold out in two weeks.
With snow flurries in the air and Christmas songs piped from a speaker, the group stopped for lunch at Heirloom Market at Comstock Ferre, where parts of the Hallmark films “Christmas on Honeysuckle Lane” and “Rediscovering Christmas” were filmed.
Once home to America’s oldest seed company, the store is located in a historic district known for its stately 1700s and 1800s buildings. It’s an ideal setting for a holiday movie. Even the local country store has sold T-shirts featuring Hallmark’s crown logo and the phrase “I Live in a Christmas Movie. Wethersfield, CT 06109.”
“People just know about us now,” said Julia Koulouris, who co-owns the market with her husband, Spiro, crediting the movie trail in part. “And you see these things on Instagram and stuff where people are tagging it and posting it.”

Christmas movies are big business — and a big deal to fans
The concept of holiday movies dates back to 1940s, when Hollywood produced classics like “It’s A Wonderful Life,” “Miracle on 34th Street” and “Christmas in Connecticut,” which was actually shot at the Warner Bros. studios in Burbank, California.
In 2006, five years after the launch of the Hallmark Channel on TV, Hallmark “struck gold” with the romance movie “The Christmas card,” said Joanna Wilson, author of the book “Tis the Season TV: The Encyclopedia of Christmas-Themed Episodes, Specials and Made-for-TV Movies.”
“Hallmark saw those high ratings and then started creating that format and that formula with the tropes and it now has become their dominant formula that they create for their Christmas TV romances,” she said.
The holiday movie industry, estimated to generate hundreds of millions of dollars a year, has expanded beyond Hallmark and Lifetime. Today, a mix of cable and broadcast networks, streaming platforms, and direct-to-video producers release roughly 100 new films annually, Wilson said. The genre has also diversified, with characters from a wider range of racial and ethnic backgrounds as well as LGBTQ+ storylines.
The formula, however, remains the same. And fans still have an appetite for a G-rated love story.
“They want to see people coming together. They want to see these romances. It’s a part of the hope of the season,” she said. “Who doesn’t love love? And it always has a predictable, happy ending.”
Hazel Duncan, 83, of Forest City, North Carolina, said she and her husband of 65 years, Owen, like to watch the movies together year-round because they’re sweet and family-friendly. They also take her back to their early years as a young couple, when life felt simpler.
“We hold hands sometimes,” she said. “It’s kind of sweet. We’ve got two recliners back in a bedroom that’s real small and we’ve got the TV there. And we close the doors off and it’s just our time together in the evening.”
Falling in love again… with a state
Connecticut’s chief marketing officer, Anthony M. Anthony, said the Christmas Movie Trail is part of a multipronged rebranding effort launched in 2023 that promotes the state not just as a tourist destination, but also as a place to work and live.
“So what better way to highlight our communities as a place to call home than them being sets of movies?” he said.
However, there continues to be debate at the state Capitol over whether to eliminate or cap film industry tax credits — which could threaten how many more of these movies will be made locally.
Christina Nieves and her husband of 30 years, Raul, already live in Connecticut and have been tackling the trail “little by little.”
It’s been a chance, she said, to explore new places in the state, like the Bushnell Park Carousel in Hartford, where a scene from “Ghost of Christmas Always” was filmed.
It also inspired Nieves to convince her husband — not quite the movie fan she is — to join her at a tree-lighting and Christmas parade in their hometown of Windsor Locks.
“I said, listen, let me just milk this Hallmark thing as long as I can, OK?” she said.

(Photo of Creston High School courtesy of the Union County Assessor's Office; social media posts sourced from court exhibits)  Supporters of the slain right-wing activist Charlie Kirk called on the Creston Community School District to “get rid” of a teacher who criticized Kirk, warned the teacher to watch her back, and stated “it will be good when this b— gets taken out,” newly released court records show.
One of the callers to the school district said of teacher Melisa Crook, “We would like her head on a platter,” while another threatened to go after “every one of (the district’s) employees, find your porn, find your records, find everything and expose all of you.”
The phone-call transcriptions and social-media posts are among the exhibits in a civil lawsuit that Crook has filed against the school district for allegedly violating her First Amendment rights by attempting to fire her for comments she made on Facebook in the immediate aftermath of Kirk’s death.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Crook’s initial Sept. 10, 2025, comment was made in response to a family member’s Facebook post about the shooting death of Kirk, a controversial, conservative political activist. Crook wrote of Kirk: “He is a terrible human being … terrible. I do not wish death on anyone, but him not being here is a blessing.”
The next morning, after seeing how others had perceived her original comment, Crook stated on Facebook that she did “not wish anyone death” and apologized.
Later that morning, she issued a more extensive apology on her own Facebook page, stating: “I do NOT condone violence or the killing of people you disagree with politically or otherwise. That was never my intent … I did not think he should be killed.”
According to the lawsuit, Superintendent Deron Stender called Crook into a meeting on Sept. 15, and reported that the district had received more than 111 emails and 140 telephone calls, with the vast majority of them asking for Crook’s firing or asking that their children be removed from her classroom.
On Sept. 25, Stender delivered to Crook a formal notice of his recommendation to terminate her teaching contract.
In her lawsuit, Crook, who has taught English for the Creston district since 2022, alleges she has been “subjected to retaliation, and is now threatened with the termination of her continuing-teaching contract, because of a private, off-duty comment on Facebook.”
School district discloses phone calls 
Included in the exhibits filed in Crook’s lawsuit are dozens of social media posts condemning Crook for comments, some of which include her photo and refer to her as a “vile monster,” a “demon,” a “supporter of terrorism” and an “evil ghoul.”
One individual posted a comment, apparently directed at the school district, stating, “You absolute s— human beings need to get it together and condemn hate.”  Another wrote, “It will be good when this b— gets taken out.”
Also included in the exhibits are the school district’s transcripts of some of the phone messages left with district officials in the wake of Crook’s Facebook comments being publicized.
Some of those who called the district specifically condemned Crook for calling Kirk “terrible” and then used that same word to describe Crook. Others quoted Crook as saying she had wished death on Kirk, although the district itself has acknowledged she wrote, “I do not wish death on anyone.”
District records indicate some of the calls were from residents of Colorado, Florida, South Carolina, Missouri, Kansas, Louisiana, Idaho and other states.
A few of the messages, such as “Kill yourself,” and “F— you,” were only a few words long, but others were more detailed. Among the transcribed messages made public by the school district:
— “Yes, this is about the maggot-covered piece of s— that you employ named Melisa Crook, celebrating political assassinations. Yeah, that’s not gonna fly. If this c— isn’t fired — (grunt) — it’s gonna get bad. Have a good day.”
— “Hey, Melisa Crook. So, we’re taking a little gander at your little post there, huh. You little f—ing c—. You murderer. You’re just so f—ing disgusting. I mean, who the hell is allowing you to be around children? You are one vile, demented scumbag. One way or another we’re gonna make sure you get fired and we’re working on it hard, honey. We’re gonna make sure you’re publicly humiliated at work, at home, in the community. Just watch your f—ing back.”
— “You have about 24 hours with which to fire the teacher that posted on her joyful happiness of Charlie Kirk’s murder before I take every one of your employees, find your porn, find your records, find everything and expose all of you. I’ll start with the principal and work my way down. 24 hours. Fire her. Because I’m very, very good at that.”
Injunction against district is granted
U.S. District Judge Rebecca Goodgame Ebinger recently extended the temporary restraining order blocking the district’s plans to terminate her. The order temporarily prevents the district’s school board from taking any “adverse employment actions” against Crook because of her Facebook comments.
Ebinger had previously ruled that Crook “is likely to succeed in showing Stender took adverse action against her in response to exercise of her First Amendment rights” and that she is “likely to succeed on the merits of her First Amendment claim as to Stender.”
Ebinger added that she concluded “Crook spoke as a citizen on a matter of public concern when posting her Facebook comment.”
As part of her lawsuit, Crook has included a 43-page document displaying a series of pro-Republican posts by Stender and school board president Don Gee.
The lawsuit also claims Stender and Gee have each “made at least one Facebook post or comment agreeing with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis asserting that in Florida, individuals have the right to hit other people with their cars” — a reference to DeSantis saying people, if they feel threatened, could drive over protesters.
The lawsuit alleges Stender has made and shared political posts on a Twitter account he also used for school purposes, including content supporting Trump and Republican Sen. Joni Ernst; content condemning the “liberal media;” comments about “riots in liberal cities;” a post about supporters of former President Biden being “snowflakes;” and one comment stating, “if you don’t like America, leave with Bruce Springsteen and the other elites.”
Two separate posts attributed to Stender also called on Iowans to “vote for Ernst” and to “vote Ernst on November 3.”
Crook’s lawsuit also references social-media posts by Gee, the school board president, that include an immigration-related comment condemning what Gee called “bull— left-wing judges.”
Crook’s lawsuit seeks actual and punitive damages for violations of her First Amendment rights. The temporary restraining order issued against the school district in October remains in effect and has been extended through Jan. 14, 2026.
The school district is currently fighting Crook’s motion for a preliminary injunction that would block any further disciplinary action, while the case is pending, once the temporary restraining order has expired. Both sides have until Dec. 22, 2025, to file briefs on that issue.
The districts is arguing that while Crook’s online comments were on a matter of public concern, they are “not protected by the First Amendment given the significant disruption caused by (her) conduct. The evidence will demonstrate (Crook’s) post caused a significant disruption and posed a very real danger of causing further disruption going forward.”



Other comments directed at the district
Here are some of the other comments directed at the Creston Community School District:
— “Yeah, is Melisa Crook still working here? Because really, you’ve, she is teaching the next generation of kids that type of s—, then you guys have a big problem. Get rid of that b—.”
— “You should start thinking about firing that b—, Melisa Crook. Oh, you employ ‘crooks’ now and pieces of s—?”
— “How about you fire Melisa? F—ing f—ts. Don’t know what the f— you’re doing. Just out here saying, ‘No comment, we don’t have comments for this.’ Well, we’ll continue to (unintelligible) you until you fire that f—ing b—, Melisa Crook. Get her out of your school. Or nobody’s gonna come back. Dumbass.”
— “Yeah, you have some sick f—ing Democrat people in that school you need to fire. It’s another trans-shooter. How many times do we have to say ‘another trans-shooter’ before we get smart with trans being a mental illness, and liberalism is a f—ing mental illness. You guys teach nothing but hate. You need to fire that person now.”
— “You’re employing Melisa Crook and she is posting on social media that Charlie Kirk should have been killed and she’s glad he’s dead. We would like her head on a platter. You need to fire that b—.”
— “You have a disgusting, vile teacher, Melisa Crook. She will be fired. Absolute disgrace. Action will be done.”
— “A lot of us on the right were canceled during COVID so now, well, turnabout is fair play. So, y’all are gonna get your taste of it. And I can’t believe somebody like Melisa Crook is somebody that reflects Iowa values. I’ve been to Iowa more than once and people seem really based and down to earth there but, you know, this person is obviously full of hate. So, you really are going to slip her back into the school and let her teach children? People like this need to find other work, maybe, I don’t know, maybe, you know, she can get purple hair and go, you know, join ANTIFA or something. But we’re gonna be watching what you do with her so just know this isn’t over. It’s not even close to over.”
— “I’m not sure what you guys teach your kids in the schools around there but it’s not OK. You need to fire this teacher effective immediately. Or you’re going to have a — Seriously, you’re going to have a, like, national outrage and you’re — Yeah, it’s not going to be good for you guys. I suggest you guys fire her ASAP.”
— “You guys need to terminate Melisa Crook’s employment immediately. We’re sick of this f—ing bull—.”
— “Hey, I just want to say I love the fact that you got some insanely racist teachers that work for you guys. You know, Ms. Crook is a woman that you guys probably should get rid of. I have no idea what she does for your school but she’s spreading absolutely horrible things online. F—ing horrible.”
— “You need to fire your teacher Melisa Crooks … All of you are scumbags and you must answer to the taxpayers. You’re all scumbags. All of you.”

— “Yeahhh. So, kind of wondering why teachers in your school district are celebrating the death of people who just want open debate. Uhm, pretty sure you’ve already been notified about Melisa Crook, one of your teachers. And it’s very disturbing, especially in a state like Iowa, that you’re kind of allowing somebody like that to indoctrinate children with her horrible ideals. So I’d do something about it.”
— “You need to fire Melisa Crook, immediately or my attorney will be suing.”
— “That lady has no right to be in a public school around children, saying them kind of remarks. She needs to be terminated immediately and, we don’t, if she isn’t terminated, we will get together with other people, we would be protesting up at the school.”
— “Good morning. Concerned, disgusted, American here. That you choose to employ Miss Crook — absolutely evil, disgusting. She needs to be fired. You guys are disgusting, too, as long as you keep her employed. Fire her.”
— “Yeah I’m calling about the Creston teacher, Melisa Crook. She needs to be terminated immediately, posting that kind of stuff, hatred on Facebook. We’re not there to have our kids indoctrinated. She needs to keep her political views and her hatred to herself. She needs to be fired immediately. And there will be a lot of people coming out for her to be fired.”
— “Yes, apparently one of your employees, Melisa Crook, is celebrating the death of another young American whose sole purpose was to create positive dialogue between young Americans. The fact that you are defending Melisa Crook, that you have not fired her, indicates you fully support and endorse that behavior and philosophy of celebrating murder in your schools. If she is not fired, we will take action by having several hundred people come to your office to have you explain to their face why, despite your motto of compassion, you believe that teachers should teach children to cheer about murder. We’re waiting.”

I would like for you guys to go over and, instead of making a statement saying that you don’t support one of your staff’s comments on the political assassination of a f—ing father and husband, maybe you guys could go ahead and fire her like you know you should and you just are protecting her for no reason. Yeah, I mean, I don’t think that a person like that, that advocates for political violence should ever be allowed to work at a f—ing school, around children. That is disgusting, and I will not rest until you guys do that.”

The mobilization coincides with President Donald Trump’s increasing antagonism toward Venezuela and its president, Nicolás Maduro.

Vermont’s congressional delegation has condemned the deployment of Vermont’s Air National Guard to the Caribbean in support of a military escalation against Venezuela. 
The Vermont National Guard has kept details of its looming deployment quiet since the plan was first reported earlier this month. Late last week, defense industry blog The War Zone reported that Vermont’s 158th Fighter Wing and its F-35A fighter jets were slated to head to the Caribbean as part of Operation Southern Spear, a development later referenced by U.S. Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt. 
The administration of President Donald Trump has ordered the U.S. military to ramp up pressure on Venezuela and its president, Nicolás Maduro, whom the administration has blamed for an influx of migrants to the U.S. and does not recognize as a legitimate president. That pressure has coincided with military preparations in the region.

U.S. military antagonism against Venezuela — and mobilizing Vermont’s guard toward that end — requires congressional approval, Welch argued, a sentiment echoed by the rest of the state’s delegation.
“I strongly oppose President Trump’s mobilization of the Vermont Air National Guard alongside thousands of other U.S. military units in what appears to be a relentless march to war,” Welch said in a statement last week. “An undeclared war against the Venezuelan regime would be illegal under our Constitution.”
Democratic members of Congress have condemned Operation Southern Spear, which has targeted alleged drug smuggling boats, killing dozens. Some Democrats and experts in international law have suggested the U.S. may have committed war crimes by targeting survivors, and even a few Republicans in Congress have pledged to investigate the drone strikes. 
It’s unclear how Vermont’s Air National Guard will support the operation, though Seven Days reported last week that the Vermonters will mobilize to a military base in Puerto Rico.
U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt, focused his criticism of the mobilization on Trump’s foreign policy escalation.
“After campaigning against ‘endless wars,’ the Trump administration is threatening a military intervention in Venezuela,” he said in a statement.
“The Vermont congressional delegation has received zero notice, information or clarity about the location, duration and purpose of this deployment,” U.S. Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt., said in a statement. “This is not normal, nor should it be tolerated.”
While each state’s National Guard troops typically are commanded by their respective governors, the president has authority to mobilize the guard in specific circumstances. Trump has pushed that power to its judicial breaking point since beginning his second term. 
Gov. Phil Scott has at least twice this year chosen not to deputize the Vermont National Guard for federal initiatives: first a request to help with clerical immigration enforcement work and later as part of Trump’s efforts to crack down on crime in Washington, D.C. 
In this case, Scott said he has no control over the mobilization, which he described as in the federal government’s jurisdiction. 
Joseph Brooks, a Vermont National Guard spokesperson, declined to provide more information about the mobilization until it happens, writing Monday, “This is a matter of operational security and to ensure the safety and security of our Airmen.”
A Pentagon spokesperson declined to comment.  
Vermont’s Air National Guard utilizes F-35A fighter jets, which the guard describes as the “most advanced and capable weapon system in the U.S. Air Force.” The 158th Fighter Wing has about 1,000 members.

(Katie McKellar/Utah News Dispatch)As part of an ongoing clash with legislative leaders over the location of her office, Auditor Tina Cannon filed a lawsuit on Friday alleging the Utah Capitol Preservation Board violated open meetings laws in September when it voted to move her office to a lower level of the Utah Capitol.
Then, on Monday morning, the Utah Capitol Preservation Board — with Senate President Stuart Adams, House Speaker Mike Schultz, Attorney General Derek Brown and other lawmakers in attendance — met again to re-vote on the move. 
Adams — who chaired Monday’s meeting because Gov. Spencer Cox was absent — said the board was meeting to vote again “out of perhaps a disagreement over the last meeting” and “perhaps even a threat of litigation.” 
Tension brews between Utah auditor and top lawmakers; Cannon keeps Capitol office space

Cannon on Friday filed a petition to sue the Utah Capitol Preservation Board, asking a judge to block its Sept. 15 vote. She alleged that the board’s agenda that day did not explicitly say that it would be voting to move her office from her current space on the second level of the Capitol, known as the rotunda, down one level to the first floor to a partially vacated section of a space known as the Visitor’s Center. 
The board’s Sept. 15 agenda only listed the discussion as “Visitor’s Center.” In her court petition, Cannon alleged that agenda didn’t meet the “reasonable specificity” requirement under Utah’s open meetings laws, and she asked a judge to void the vote. 
During Monday’s meeting, Assistant Attorney General Paul Tonks said he had advised the board to re-vote “out of the abundance of caution” to resolve any question of potential violations of Utah’s Open Meetings Act. 
During the September meeting, Utah Treasurer Marlo Oaks was the only board member to vote against the move — but he was absent from Monday’s meeting. The board voted unanimously to approve the move, relocating Cannon’s office across the hall from Oaks’ office and near the Capital’s east entrance, which is the main entrance for public access. 
Later Monday afternoon, Cannon told Utah News Dispatch that she had pulled her lawsuit after the re-vote, saying she will no longer challenge the board’s adherence to open meeting laws. 
“I’m told that they have complied,” she said. “At least, if nothing else, I have maintained through this whole thing, if you are going to do something like this, then do it in the open. Do not do it behind closed doors, do not hide it in a piece of legislation. Own it. And do it open and in the public. And that’s what they did.”

She added “I don’t like how they did it, but they at least did it in the open.” 
Asked if she intends to continue to fight the move or file any additional legal challenges, Cannon said “I’m still weighing those options.” 
She added that she has yet to get any details of her new office space or whether it’s reasonably similar to her current space, as required by state law. 
“We have yet to see any of the documents indicating where the space is, what it looks like, when I’m supposed to move,” she said. “We have been excluded from all of that.” 
The fight over the auditor’s office
Cannon, a Republican, has clashed with GOP legislative leaders, particularly Adams, over her current office space, arguing she should stay on the rotunda level near other independently elected offices, like governor and the attorney general. She has also argued the visible location helps encourage public access and transparency. 
Cannon also argues that if Senate leaders want to move junior and Democratic lawmakers from the Senate Building to the main Capitol building, they should be moved to the Senate’s current staff offices instead of her suite on the rotunda, which she argues would require less remodeling. 
Earlier this year, lawmakers drafted a bill to move Cannon’s office — but they abandoned it after Cannon fought it publicly, accusing Adams of bullying her. At the time, Adams and other Senate leaders expressed disappointment in Cannon. They said conversations around office space in the Capitol have been going on for years, stemming from construction of a new state office building to the north of the Capitol’s main building.

In her comments to the Capitol Preservation Board on Sept. 15, Cannon said Senate offices shouldn’t be moved into the main Capitol building at the expense of executive branch offices like hers. 
“If there are Senate offices that need to be moved, the Senate staff offices should be moved before the executive branch official offices are moved,” she said, adding that her office space isn’t “grand” but “humble.” 
“I’m happy with my office,” she said. “I would respectfully ask that you leave it where it is, or if you decide to move it, you would at least offer the respect to the Office of the State Auditor that is due, and that would be including me in the process of how you determine space usage at the Capitol.” 
Adams, during the September meeting, pointed to a Utah law passed in 2024 that says beginning in January 2025, Cannon’s current office space would be “under the direction and control of the board and assigned for the use of the state auditor, until a substantially similar space in the State Capitol is assigned to the state auditor.” After which, that office suite would then fall “under the direction and control of the Legislature.”

“Is there objection to following the law?” Adams asked. “Because what I’m hearing today is the auditor does not want to follow the statute, and doesn’t want to follow the law. She wants to remain in space that the statute says will be moved.”
The same law also says that before Oct. 1, 2024, “the governor, the state auditor, the attorney general, the state treasurer, the president of the Senate, and the speaker of the House of Representatives shall assess the use of space in the State Capitol to determine the best use of the space.” 
Cannon alleged she wasn’t adequately looped in on a space study on Capitol building uses, saying the last time the study was shown to her, it “left my space in the Capitol exactly where it was untouched.” 
During Monday’s meeting, Adams said “my understanding is that requirement had been met.” Tonks agreed, saying “the statute just simply says a study, (and) does not require for people to sign off.” 
“Again, it is the board that has the authority as per space allocation, according to the statute,” Tonks said. 
Cannon’s supporters — including two Republican House representatives, Rep. Michael Petersen and Rep. Tiara Auxier — crowded into the Capitol Preservation Board’s meeting Monday. 
Petersen said the auditor’s office “is an example of openness and sunshine and transparency” during a time when many people feel distrustful of the government. 
“I think we ought to be doing everything we can to support and encourage .. and showcase (the auditor’s office),” he said. “Because of the good work that they do, I want them accessible, visible.”
Adams, in response, said “we agree,” while implying the freed up space in the Visitor’s Center near the east public entrance wouldn’t diminish that.

“We think the entry into the Capitol is a great spot to be able to showcase that,” Adams said. 
When asked about the Visitor Center location and if it’s suitable for her office, Cannon told Utah News Dispatch the real question is why part-time senators need to be moved from the Senate Building to the main Capitol Building. 
“Why do we need the expense of remodeling two sections?” she said. “If it is a great space downstairs, why is it not appropriate to put the legislators there?”
Remodeling two offices, she said, “is unnecessary.” 
“There’s no reason why it needed to happen,” she said. “Obviously I do not rule the day, so they have a different opinion, and it won today.” 
Move has chilling effect, Cannon says
Cannon said she worried the vote to move her has larger implications on her office and whether it’s able to maintain its independence to audit the Capitol Preservation Board.

“The vote today has brought into question whether or not any report that I release, regardless of what it says, is tainted by the vote today,” she said. “If I am able to be swept from my space without my input, that is a chilling message to send to the state auditor. And how I will handle that message will take some careful consideration, and that will take me some time.” 
Cannon noted that she has oversight over the Capitol Preservation Board’s spending, which she said has totaled about $327 million in recent years, mostly because of the new state office building construction to the north of the main Capitol building. 
“Because of their vote today … whatever report that I release (on that spending), the question will be there for the public. Did she pull back or was she harder because of their actions?” she said. “That taints that independence.” 
Cannon said now “the only option I feel like I have at this point” is to scrap the work her office has already done to audit the Capitol Preservation Board’s spending and to hire an independent auditor for the task “so that there is no concern over the independence of the report.”

(Courtesy of the Sioux Falls School District)Fifteen more teachers graduated from South Dakota’s teacher apprenticeship program this month, the state Department of Education announced Monday.
The program, started in 2023, allows full-time paraprofessionals — sometimes called teacher’s aides — to pursue a teaching degree online through Dakota State University in elementary or special education, or through Northern State University in secondary education, at a steep discount while retaining their position.
South Dakota turned to paraprofessionals to attack a teacher shortage, and hundreds responded

The latest group to graduate pushes the program’s total graduate number to more than 70. Two hundred and forty paraprofessionals have participated so far in the program.
The majority of graduates have signed teaching contracts and are filling vacancies across South Dakota public and private schools.
The goal of the program is reducing the teacher shortage in the state. Statewide, 144 teaching positions were unfilled as of July, weeks before the school year started, according to the Associated School Boards of South Dakota. That’s the lowest number in recent years: There were 202 unfilled positions in July 2024, 256 in 2023, 225 in 2022 and 174 in 2021.
Recent graduates were sponsored by school districts ranging from rural Bison in western South Dakota to Tea in the Sioux Falls metro area.
“The TAP program has opened doors and new possibilities for paraprofessionals to fulfill their dreams, for school districts to fill positions, and for kids to have that constant, well-trained professional leading their classrooms,” said Dakota State University Professional Academic Advisor Addie Borah in a news release.
Kathryn Blaha, state Education Department director for accreditation and certification, said support and continued interest in the program is “astounding.”
“It is exciting to see these new teachers who have demonstrated their commitment to our communities and schools entering their own classrooms to continue their service to our students as certified educators,” Blaha said in the news release.
Eighty candidates from 50 school districts and private schools were selected for the program’s third cohort, the department announced this summer. The second cohort included 70 participants, five of which dropped out, and 90 participants were in the first cohort, 18 of which dropped out.
The Department of Education started the program, but it’s currently funded through the state Department of Labor and Regulation with a combination of state and federal grants to reimburse universities for the discounted portion of tuition and other programming. 
School districts pay $1,000 a year per apprentice. Apprentices are responsible for up to $1,000 a year in tuition, books and state assessments.



 New teaching graduates

Fifteen apprentices representing 13 school districts recently graduated from Dakota State University with their teaching degrees. Most graduates stay and take on a teaching position in their sponsored district, according to the state Department of Education.
The department did not immediately respond to South Dakota Searchlight questions about where the new graduates are contracted to teach.

Our students deserve rigorous statewide standards, not subjective benchmarks at a district’s discretion.","When a student receives their high school diploma, it should signify their readiness for a next step, whether that’s joining the workforce, pursuing a vocation, or entering college. A key part of ensuring this readiness is enforcing rigorous statewide graduation standards that prepare every student for a fruitful life after graduation. 
Last fall, voters in Massachusetts chose to eliminate passing the 10th grade MCAS as a graduation requirement, prompting interim standards to be put in place while Gov. Maura Healey’s K-12 Statewide Graduation Council drafted a more detailed framework.  
Earlier this month, Gov. Healey released an initial report on what that new framework would look like. It’s a promising start, and if executed well, could lead us down a path for boosting students’ success well beyond their high school years.  
The proposed framework outlines seven components, which include completion of a specific program of study, end-of-course assessments, capstones or portfolios, individualized “My Career and Academic Plans,” completion of FAFSA or MASFA financial aid forms, financial literacy, and seals of distinction.  
Key details on how these components will be implemented, and what they will cost, remain unseen. And while the council aims to release further details in June 2026, it’s important to call particular attention to the proposed use of end-of-course assessments and their importance.  
These tests would be designed and scored by the state — a similar concept to MCAS — but instead of a single test, the assessments would be administered at the end of specific courses.  
In addition to these tests, students would have to demonstrate mastery of subjects through capstones or portfolios that are designed by the state but scored locally. Details on how this hybrid testing model will contribute toward a student’s diploma are also yet to be determined.  
The end-of-course assessments have caused an uproar from the Massachusetts Teachers Association, the main proponents of doing away with MCAS. They say implementing any form of standardized testing goes against the will of the voters.  
But this claim has no basis in fact. Voters simply chose to eliminate the 10th grade MCAS as a graduation requirement, not the broad use of standardized testing, which is still in place. Without the use of MCAS as a prerequisite for graduation, districts set their own requirements based on the state’s interim regulations to pass certain courses. This presented a major dilemma: a haphazard set of graduation standards across the state with effectively no way to measure student competency in an unbiased way. 
While the Legislature will face opposition to end-of-course assessments, it’s vital that policymakers understand their importance in not only educational value, but also meeting the state’s legal requirements. The new framework for graduation must meet the state’s baseline constitutional obligations, as well as those outlined by the state’s Supreme Judicial Court rulings in both the McDuffy and Hancock cases, citing the state’s pivotal role to provide a high-quality education to every child. 
If integrated properly, end-of-course assessments could fill the void we currently face. In fact, many states are already using them to measure student competency. These tests should also function as a diagnostic tool in conjunction with MCAS, helping to determine which students need additional support and in what subject areas before graduating.  
Moving forward, it’s essential for state leaders to determine exactly how end-of-course assessments will count toward graduation. It’s been made clear by the secretary of education and state education commissioner that these tests alone will not bar students from graduating, but students and families deserve to know that the time spent taking these tests matters.  
Our 2025 10th grade scores have shown us that performance dips when students perceive that a test doesn’t matter — and knowing it “counts” will ensure that students take these tests seriously.  
Several other important ideas were outlined in the proposed framework, such as expanding access to career pathways, vocational-technical programs, and early college; integrating capstones and portfolios; and incorporating financial literacy into existing school schedules. The cost and timeline for implementation are also still to be determined.  
The proposed graduation framework is a hopeful indication that we’re on track to best serve all of our students’ needs and prepare them for today’s global economy.  
As the council finalizes details in the coming months, ensuring a reliable, objective measure of student competency must remain a top priority. Our students deserve rigorous statewide standards, not subjective benchmarks at a district’s discretion.

After that, the Office of Independent Investigations aims to expand into central Washington.
The increased push for police accountability in cases where officers use deadly force, especially against Black people, drove the creation of the new state office. 
The goal is to remove the bias that may come from local police detectives investigating killings in their areas, as is currently done in most of the state. 
It took years to staff up the agency and get it off the ground.
Now, the office is ramping up slowly. Starting in December 2024, it began by investigating new cases in a more rural swath of western Washington, stretching from the northwestern edge of the Olympic Peninsula to Clark and Skamania counties on the border with Oregon. The agency calls this Region 1. There are six regions in total. Pierce County will be Region 2. 
“OII is committed to serving all of Washington State by growing our operations,” the agency’s director, Roger Rogoff, said in a statement. “Being able to expand to Region 2 is a significant step forward.”
The central Washington area, covering 10 counties from Okanogan to Walla Walla, is Region 5. The regions were developed based on the average number of cases in each area.
The office’s biggest obstacle to expanding more rapidly is limited staffing. It has 66 employees, and nearly half of those are investigators spread throughout the state. 
Detectives who live in other regions can respond to cases elsewhere. Some have come from as far as Spokane to investigate cases on the west side of the state.
Region 1 has nine investigators living there, while the Pierce County region has five. The central Washington region has eight. 
When the office was created, it was believed that five or six investigators per region would be sufficient. But anywhere from 12 to 18 are needed to respond to each incident, agency officials believe.
This year, in the face of a budget shortfall that forced a range of cuts, lawmakers slashed the agency’s funding by 20%, spawning fears that it could be kneecapped.
It’s now requesting 20 new investigative positions in the supplemental budget legislators will pass next year. The office would’ve asked for even more if the budget situation were brighter, but even this plea is likely to be an uphill battle as lawmakers still face a shortfall. 
Another obstacle to growing the office is not having an evidence storage facility on the east side of the Cascades. 
The office has so far launched a half-dozen investigations into police use of deadly force, three in Clark County and one each in Clallam, Kitsap and Lewis counties. 
Two have finished, and prosecutors have made a charging decision in one of them. In Lewis County, the prosecuting attorney declined to charge a Centralia police officer with a crime after he killed Alecandro Castaneda during a struggle. 
“Deadly force was necessary in this matter,” Prosecutor Jonathan Meyer wrote in his charging decision. “The actions of Mr. Castaneda made it clear he had no interest in a peaceful resolution.”
The Office of Independent Investigations doesn’t weigh in on whether criminal charges should be filed.

Beyond the inquiries into new cases, the office is also tasked with looking at old instances where police used deadly force and new evidence has been discovered. Members of the public can submit review requests online. 
To prepare for its expansion to Pierce County, agency officials will meet with local police leaders, community members, tribal governments and others.

As I’ve been traveling the state, and talking to people and listening to folks, we need fighters who are willing to be on the frontlines. And that’s why I’m excited to let you know that I am really strongly considering running for the United State Senate.”
A Jacksonville native, Nixon has represented a portion of Duval County in the Florida House since 2020, where as a member of the political minority she has at best limited influence over state policy. She said in October that she will not run for re-election next year, even though she’s not term-limited out of office until 2028. When the Phoenix asked why, Nixon simply sighed and said it was time to move on.
Similarly, in the Facebook post making that announcement, she gave no reason for her decision to leave the seat, but instead directed her supporters to go directly to her website. There they can contribute to the federal exploratory committee that she set up in August, which allows her to collect and spend money while still determining whether she wants to commit to an effort for federal office.
She told the Phoenix last month and again Sunday that while she might run for the Senate next year, she also might choose to stay local and run for a seat on the Jacksonville City Council in 2027.
Field for U.S. Senate in ’26
Gov. Ron DeSantis appointed Moody to the Senate in January after President Donald Trump nominated Marco Rubio for secretary of state. The most prominent Democrat to enter the Senate race is former Brevard County School Board member Jennifer Jenkins. A public opinion poll conducted by the University of North Florida’s Public Opinion Research Lab in October showed Moody with an 11-point lead over Jenkins, 49%-38%.
The Cook Political Report listed the race in October as a “solid R” seat.
Nixon has been one of the most progressive Democrats serving in the House since her first election in 2020. She said she embarked on her statewide tour “because I feel like Floridians can’t keep waiting for things to get better someday.”
“We literally have folks who are empowered in our state and in our country who are saying that they want to make America ‘great again’ and return back to the ‘good ole days,’” she said.
“But the reality is the good ole days weren’t good enough for everyone, right? I know they weren’t good enough for women all the time. They weren’t good enough for Black people, or for Hispanic and Latino people, all the time. They definitely weren’t good enough for members of the LGTBQ community all the time, or working-class folks at all, like workers. Actual workers who actually help keep this country moving.”
She lamented the scheduled ending of the enhanced subsidies for individuals on the Affordable Care Act that are scheduled to end on December 31. She said she recently talked to one Floridian who is going to see their health insurance deductible soar from $4,000 annually to $15,000.
Nixon, a mother of five, criticized proposals pushed by Republicans over the past two legislative sessions that would have allowed teenagers as young as 14 to work overnight on school days and work longer than eight hours the day before a school day. (Those measures died in both sessions).
She noted that the Legislature earlier this year repealed a 2023 law requiring middle schools to start no later than 8 a.m. and high school no later than 8:30 a.m.
“The reason you want them to go to school late is because you want them to work them all night because you want cheap labor,” she said about lawmakers and others who supported that legislation.
The purpose of her statewide tour is to let people know that “we deserve so much more,” Nixon said.
“We deserve to live in a country and in a state where everyone has the opportunities to be healthy,” she continued. “To be prosperous, to experience joy and to experience rest. We deserve to have elected officials who care about people, who are going to stand up to the big corporations. Big corporations who profit off of us being divided and fighting amongst each other. Division is very popular. … Division is possible because it keeps us off what they’re doing, and how they are padding the campaign coffers of these folks that are passing these detrimental bills to our community.”
‘The biggest pain’
Nixon has proudly proclaimed herself “the biggest pain in Ron DeSantis’ ass,” and has earned the enmity of Republicans over the years, such as when she led a protest on the House floor in 2022 to protest a vote on the congressional map drawn up by DeSantis that eliminated two districts where Black residents constituted a plurality.
Republican Party of Florida Chair Evan Power mocked Nixon after she wrote on social media in September that she was considering a bid for Senate. “I needed a good laugh today, looks like @AngieNixon wants to lose a U.S. Senate race. I think it’s a great idea,” Power wrote on X.
Introducing Nixon Sunday was her Florida Democratic House colleague, Michele Rayner, who represents parts of Pinellas and Hillsborough counties.
Rayner has filed to run for the Florida Senate District 16 Tampa Bay area seat that will be vacated next year by Democratic incumbent Darryl Rouson due to term limits. Among her opponents in that Democratic primary next August is Florida House Democratic Leader Fentrice Driskell. Rayner told the liberal-leaning audience on Sunday that they should vet all candidates when they go to vote next year, Republican and Democrat alike.
“As you guys get inundated with candidates, especially candidates from the same party, I’m here to tell you that not everybody is cut from the same cloth,” she said. “You need to make sure that the people who are running – whether they’re a Democrat, they’re running as a Democrat — they actually give a s*** about you. There are many people that are running so that they can pad their own pockets and make their situation better, but don’t give a s*** about people.”
Nixon’s next stop on her “Awake the State” listening tour will take place in Tampa on Monday night.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/0-4-1024x771.jpeg,,,2025-12-15 17:56:42.767638

John Larson with three challengers.","Jack Perry exited the race for the Democratic nomination for Congress in the 1st District on Monday, leaving Congressman John B. Larson with three challengers: Ruth Fortune, Luke Bronin and Jillian Gilchrest.
Perry, 35, is a businessman and former councilman from Southington who declared his candidacy in July, becoming the second Democrat in the contest after Fortune, a Hartford Board of Education member.
He was quickly followed by Bronin, the former mayor of Hartford, and Gilchrest, a state representative from West Hartford.
“It gets too crowded a field. The last thing I want to do is muddy the waters,” Perry said. “We are changing as a party.”
As Sept. 30, the close of the last reporting period, Perry had spent nearly $61,000, while raising $28,810. He loaned his campaign $500,000.
The father of a 5-year-old son and 5-month-old daughter, Perry said he reflected over Thanksgiving about ending his campaign. 
“Your kids are only little for so long,” he said.
Larson, 77, of East Hartford, won the open seat in 1998, succeeding Democrat Barbara B. Kennelly of Hartford, who ran for governor that year. It was the last time Larson had competition for the nomination.
“If you look at the race, Larson is a good Democrat. It’s just time. Everyone says that,” he said.
Larson, of course, begs to differ. He is raising money seeking support from the likely delegates to the Democratic nominating convention next spring. As of Sept. 30, he had $879,000 in his campaign account, second to Bronin’s $1.1 million.

DOVER, Del. — On the heels of vocal concerns, even outrage, from both residential and commercial property owners, Delaware’s Reassessment Committee convened Monday.  The purpose was to address the far-reaching impact of property reassessment on school funding, with lawmakers and education leaders calling for sweeping reforms to ensure fairness and transparency across the state’s districts.  This was the last of four planned meetings of this Special Joint Committee.
Senator Bryan Townsend, Senate Majority Leader of Delaware (delaware.gov)
Committee Chair Senator Townsend opened the hearing by emphasizing the importance of reassessment in resolving local school tax issues. “We must address these issues together and work toward a comprehensive solution,” Senator Townsend said.
Dr. Darrell Green, President of the Chief School Officers Association, outlined the meeting’s goal: clarifying how reassessment affects local school funding and why communities are experiencing different outcomes. “We’re committed to fairness, transparency, and collaboration,” Dr. Green said.
Presenters explained that local funding accounts for 29% of school revenue statewide, with the reassessment process increasing property values and leading to significant changes in tax bills.  A fictional example was used to illustrate the situation and what was meant by “revenue neutral.”  In the example, the pre-reassessment tax base was $3 billion, generating $30 million in revenue with a tax rate of $1.  Post-reassessment, the tax base increased to $15 billion, this required a decrease in the tax rate to $0.20 to generate the same $30 million in tax revenue.
Furthering that example, various homes were shown, previously valued at $25K, $50K and $75K in the 1983 Assessment.  These home values increased in ways that could result in tax burdens that ranged from a 3% DECREASE to a 68% INCREASE for the 2025 tax burden.  This was in the context of the reassessment being OVERALL “revenue neutral.”
The committee highlighted the need for equalization reform to address structural inequities and ensure fair taxation across districts.  Equalization funds come from the State General Fund and are intended to offset the significant differences in the tax base available to support student education costs across school districts in the state.
Emily Falcon, a school finance officer from the Colonial School District and Public Education Funding Commission member, described the complexity of the tax rate setting process. “The focus is on local funding, which accounts for just over 29% of the funds districts receive statewide. Equalization is a significant component tied to local property receipts,” Emily said.
Monet Smith, Chief Operating Officer of Delmar School District, discussed disparities between districts. “The reassessment increased wealth disparity between districts, emphasizing the need to fix equalization,” Monet Smith said.
During the Q&A session, Senator Elizabeth “Tizzy” Lockman asked about the timeline for adjusting and adopting the frozen equalization formula. Emily responded, “We’re aiming for implementation in fiscal year 2028,” referencing the committee’s long-term goals.
Senator Buckson questioned the disparity between tax rates in different districts and i

ts impact on operations. Dr. Darrell Green and Emily Falcon explained the operational limitations and the impact of reassessment on tax rates, noting, “Some homes are experiencing significant increases, and it’s important to communicate these changes clearly to residents”.
Representative Smith discussed the concept of revenue neutrality and its impact on tax bills. “Revenue neutrality only affects the current expense tax rate, with other components like tuition and MCI unaffected,” Emily explained.
The committee stressed the importance of regular reassessment and accurate data to prevent future distortions. The changes that were adopted in the recent “Special Sessions” of the General Assembly are effective ONLY for the current tax year.  They are “band-aid” solutions for 2025 taxes and the situation will require the General Assembly to identify and implement steps to resolve citizen concerns for 2026 and beyond.  Recommendations included developing a transparent communications plan, standardizing county assessment methodologies, and preparing a reform package for the General Assembly by April.
The meeting concluded with a commitment to continued collaboration between school districts and lawmakers. “We must address these issues together and work toward a comprehensive solution,” Senator Townsend said.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Senate-Resassess-Comm-2025-12-15-.png,,,2025-12-15 16:57:36.510248
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-15 21:45:54+00:00,CT Mirror,Thousands in Waterbury still without water as pipe repairs go on,John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/15/thousands-in-waterbury-still-without-water-as-pipe-repairs-go-on/,"The outage began Friday, when a break in a smaller distribution pipe washed away the ground underneath a much larger, high-pressure pipe.","Thousands of residents in Waterbury remained without potable water on Monday, three days after a large transmission main ruptured and sent water cascading over city frozen streets while crews scrambled to contain the damage.
The outage began on Friday evening, when a break in a smaller distribution pipe along Thomaston Avenue washed away the ground underneath a much larger, high-pressure transmission pipe, causing it to fail catastrophically.
The break distrupted water service to all of Waterbury — a city of over 100,000 people — as well as the smaller adjacent towns of Wolcott and Watertown.
While water was restored to Watertown and some neighborhoods in Waterbury over the weekend, crews surveying the 36-inch transmission pipe found the damage to be “more extensive” than originally thought, Mayor Paul Pernerewski said in an update on social media Sunday.
By Monday, Pernerewski said that roughly 60% of residents remained without water, mostly on the East Side, while the rest of the city was under a boil alert until officials could get water flowing fully through the system and have it tested.
“I do want to thank all of our residents for their continued cooperation,” Perneweski said. “I know that this is not an easy thing. The good news is even though the water’s not going to be potable, once the water starts flowing the sanitation issue will change.”
In order to get the water flowing to the East End, crews worked overnight Sunday to install an emergency bypass valve to divert water around the broken transmission line. However, workers soon discovered that one of the gaskets in the new valve was leaking, and needed to be welded before the water could turn back on.
Bradley Malay, the city’s superintendent of water, said he expected work on the emergency valve to be completed Monday evening. From there, he said the city would begin slowly pumping water to get rid of the trapped air within the system — while avoiding going too fast so that the pressure doesn’t overwhelm the pipes.
“The last thing we need is to break more mains further down the road because we were impatient,” Malay said. “I’m going to go slow.”
In order to aid that effort, Malay asked city residents to run their bathtubs Monday evening until they hear the air escape and the water begins to run smoothly.
If all goes according to plan, Malay said that the city could be ready to send water samples out for testing on Tuesday. It takes 24 hours for lab to process those samples, meaning if they are clean the earliest Waterbury residents could resume drinking water is Wednesday.
“That is my rainbow-in-the-sky outlook on things, but again those things are all kind of subject to how fast we can get the system flushed out,” Malay said.
In the meantime, Pernerewski announced that the city’s schools will remain closed on Tuesday. Health officials also warned that any restaurants without their own source of water independent of the public water system must remain closed as long as the boil advisory is in effect.
With the help of the Connecticut National Guard, the city set up two distribution stations for bottled water: Municipal Stadium on Watertown Avenue and Crosby High School.
By Monday afternoon, however, the demand for water had exhausted the city’s supplies.
Pernerewski said the city distributed 32,877 gallons of water Saturday followed by another 43,699 gallons in just the first two hours of Monday morning. By 12:30 p.m., he said the city temporarily closed both of its distribution sites with plans to reopen them around 3 p.m. when a caravan of 10 trucks was expected to arrive with fresh supplies.
As that deadline came and went, however, drivers in the long line of cars waiting outside of Municipal Stadium were told by volunteers that the trucks were stuck in traffic and there was no timeline for when they might arrive.
One of those drivers, 55-year-old Chris Robinson, had been waiting for nearly an hour when the news came. He said he was willing to wait a bit longer — stocks at nearby stores were already depleted, he said — but already he was trying to come up with other plans.
“I might have to go to Hartford or wherever,” looking for bottled water, he said. “I have four kids.”
Just after 4 p.m., the trucks arrived and workers began offloading pallets of water bottles.

Ashley Alicea, 25, was complimentary of the city’s response despite the delay in getting water. She said officials had worked quickly to open up showers for residents at the YMCA, and her mother had been able to pick up water from the distrubtion site during an earlier trip over the weekend.
“I think they’re doing a great job despite the complaints people have been posting online,” she said. “It’s the whole not-knowing-when-it’s-going-to-come-back that’s making me anxious.”
Pernerewski said on Monday that Waterbury has already invested $30 million over the last year on upgrades to the city’s water system, but the work was being done in segments due to the advanced age of the system. The smaller pipe that was the original source of the break last week, for example, was built in 1901.
The cost of all that maintenance has also served as a point of contention among officials in the Naugatuck Valley.
In 2018, officials in Waterbury attempted to raise rates on water the city supplied to its smaller neighbors, including the town of Watertown. The response from officials in Watertown was to continue paying the older, lower water rates while protesting the rate hike.
Waterbury sued, and in 2023 a superior court judge ruled in the city’s favor, ordering Watertown to pay $18.8 million in unpaid water bills. The town appealed the decision, only to lose again earlier this year, by which point its debts had ballooned to $34 million.
Watertown began paying the higher water rates shortly before voters in the town approved a bond measure allowing them to pay off their remaining debts. Officials have also explored the possibility of selling the town’s water system to pay off those bonds.
Pernerewski said Monday that the dispute and delay in getting payments from Watertown was not connected to any of the issues that led to last week’s break.
“It’s a frustrating situation,” he said. “I understand fully the frustrations and I share those, and I would just ask [residents] to be patient.”
“We’ve been working to find a solution as quickly as we could, and we have one at this point that I fully believe is going to work, and I think within the next few hours, you’re going to see it.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/waterb-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-12-15 16:57:36.510248

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Iowa Farmers Union members said Monday that the federal decision to end enhanced tax credits related to the Affordable Care Act will negatively impact farm and rural economies by drastically cutting into farmers’ budgets. 
Farmers on the call said their premiums are slated to increase by thousands of dollars in 2026 if Congress does not extend the tax credits. 
According to data gathered by the health policy outlet KFF, 27% of farmers, ranchers and agricultural managers rely on individual marketplace insurances, the large majority of which are purchased through ACA Marketplaces. 
Matt Russell, Iowa Farmers Union executive director and Marion County farmer, said the current health care system is flawed, but increasing premiums for the more than 24 million Americans who benefit from ACA coverage is “outrageous” and delivers a “gut punch” to working families. 
“The Affordable Care Act provided a path for small businesses, entrepreneurs and farmers to pursue livelihoods that didn’t require having someone work a job for the health insurance benefits,” Russell said. “…Remember the days when the farming family had to have an off-farm job for health insurance? Because Republicans are letting these enhanced premium tax credits expire, we are headed back in that direction.”

Enhanced tax credits for folks who purchase from the Affordable Care Act Marketplaces were rolled out in 2021 and extended through 2025. The credits increased the amount of assistance enrollees could receive and allowed enrollees with household incomes above 400% of the federal poverty level to receive tax credits. 
The enhanced credits led to a more than doubling of the number of people enrolled in ACA plans, with the vast majority receiving the tax credits to partially offset the cost of their premiums, according to KFF research.
Beth Hoffman, a Monroe County farmer raising beef and goats, said she and her husband sit at or below the 400% poverty line most years, which for a household of two in 2025 is about $84,600 annually. Hoffman said with the enhanced credits, there was a graduated drop-off that meant if they sold slightly more beef one year and their income tipped to $85,000, they would still be eligible for a portion of the premium tax credits. 
 If the credits are not extended and Hoffman’s farm brings in more than $85,000 in 2026, she and her husband would owe that credit, which she said would be close to $16,000. 
Hoffman said the result is that she and her husband have opted for a less comprehensive health care plan, with a more than $8,000 deductible per person. 
“The choice that we made was not to go into a doctor more often, and to just deal with all the issues you might have with your health,” Hoffman said. “This in a nation that has some of the top health care in the world, I just I can’t access it now because I’d have to be paying this deductible.” 
Hoffman said living in a rural area, there are a limited number of health care providers to choose from, which can make a change in insurance even more cumbersome to navigate. 
The Iowa Farmers Union virtual press conference was held Dec. 15, which coincided with the deadline to sign up for ACA plans for 2026 coverage. 
Seth Watkins, who runs a cow-calf operation with sheep and bees in Page County, said insurance premiums for his family of four are set to increase from about $600 each month to $2,300 each month, plus an increased out-of-pocket threshold per person. 
Watkins questioned if the politicians deciding these policies understand that farmers and independent business owners have to buy their own insurance plans. 
“Our politicians talk about us being the backbone of our economy, and yet the people that are making these decisions have great benefits,” Watkins said. “I’d like them to put themselves in our shoes and understand what this is like.” 
He said a bad market or poor weather is not what will put him out of business as a farmer, “it’s a catastrophic health issue.”

Democrats in the nation’s capital have been pushing for an extension to the ACA tax credits, which resulted in the nation’s longest federal government shutdown earlier this year, but subsequent efforts to extend the credits have not garnered the necessary votes. 
Republicans introduced their own bills to lower health care costs in both the House and the Senate. The Senate bill, which did not pass last week, would fund Health Savings Accounts, tax-advantaged savings accounts that consumers tap for medical expenses that are not otherwise reimbursed, for ACA enrollees. 
The House bill, sponsored by Iowa Republican U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, would target Pharmacy Benefit Managers and appropriate cost-share reduction payments beginning in 2027. The House plans to debate the bill this week. 
The bill would also allow a group of employers to purchase a plan together to receive a lower rate than they could as individuals.
Russell said these are issues that need to be addressed in the future, but don’t help the farmers and entrepreneurs that are set to pay “exorbitant premiums” in the new year.
“If that’s their plan to address what we’re facing with the expiration of the enhanced premium tax credits, then they’re basically saying: you’re on your own for ‘26,” he said. 
Russell said the issue hits especially hard for businesses and farms above the 400% poverty threshold who used the ACA Marketplaces to purchase insurance. This group, he said, represents the “middle” of agriculture where farmers are trying to scale up to be full-time farmers. 
Aaron Lehman, the union’s president, spoke at a congressional hearing about the enhanced credits in early December. Lehman said Monday the enhanced credits allowed farmers to innovate, upgrade equipment, grow their farms and have a “doable” budget.
“All of this is economic activity that’s really important for our rural communities, but if the enhanced premium tax credits expire, the cost to our farmers will be deep, and it will cave in family budgets,” Lehman said. 
Watkins said the “belt tightening” in his family budget because of the expired credits will mean fewer trips to the local restaurant in town and probably no equipment upgrades in 2026. 
“That’s less money we’re spending at home, and Iowa does not need that right now,” Watkins said. 
Farm payments won’t be of much help
On Dec. 8, the Trump administration announced it would send $12 billion in one-time payments to farmers across the country who have suffered from market disruption. 
The amount that Iowa farmers will receive is not yet determined, but farmers on the Monday call said the payments will go toward farm income gaps that were already there, regardless of health care costs going up.
“If it stays in my bank account for a day, it’d be a miracle,” Watkins said.
Lehman said health care increases combined with farmers’ high input costs and disrupted trade markets, are leading to “incredibly difficult conversations” about how to make next year’s crop. 
“The Affordable Care Act works when we can take good steps to get the next generation onto the farm, and it works when rural people can freely move to jobs that are more beneficial to their farm and to their family,” Lehman said. “All those things tell us that these investments we make for affordable policies with the Affordable Care Act are very worthwhile.”

Free.,"Whole milk back on school lunch menus, under bill on its way to Trump",Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/whole-milk-back-school-lunch-menus-under-bill-its-way-trump,,"WASHINGTON — School cafeterias got a step closer to seeing whole milk again after the U.S. House passed a measure Monday to restore the dairy staple to school lunches. The bill unanimously passed the Senate back in November, and now heads to President Donald Trump’s desk. The bipartisan effort — which passed the House by voice vote — came after whole milk was barred from school meal programs for more than a decade amid a broader push to curb childhood obesity. Under the bill, schools that participate in the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National School Lunch Program would be allowed to offer “flavored and unflavored organic or nonorganic whole, reduced-fat, low-fat, and fat-free fluid milk and lactose free fluid milk” as well as “nondairy beverages that are nutritionally equivalent to fluid milk and meet the nutritional standards established by the Secretary.” The bill also would exempt milk fat from being considered saturated fat as it applies to schools’ “allowable average saturated fat content of a meal.” The measure allows parents and guardians, on top of physicians, to offer a written statement for their student to receive a nondairy milk substitute.  GOP Sens. Roger Marshall of Kansas and Dave McCormick of Pennsylvania, along with Democratic Sens. Peter Welch of Vermont and John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, introduced the measure in the Senate in January. Republican Rep. Glenn “GT” Thompson of Pennsylvania and Democratic Rep. Kim Schrier of Washington state brought corresponding legislation in the House.‘An essential building block’During floor debate Monday, Thompson, who chairs the House Agriculture Committee, said the bill’s purpose is to “restore students’ access to a wide variety of milk options, ensuring students have the necessary nutrients to learn and to grow.” Thompson said “milk is an essential building block for a well-rounded and balanced diet, offering 13 essential nutrients and numerous health benefits,” but that “unfortunately, out-of-touch and outdated federal regulations have imposed restrictions on the types of milk students have access to in school meals.” Thompson pointed out that the bill “does not require any student to drink or any school to serve whole milk” and instead “simply gives schools the flexibility to serve a broader variety of milk in the school lunchroom.” But Rep. Bobby Scott, ranking member of the House Committee on Education and Workforce, voiced his opposition, saying that while the bill “does make some improvements to the whole milk debate with its inclusion of better options for students seeking non-dairy alternatives,” he remains “disappointed that the bill overall would make school meals less healthy.”The Virginia Democrat said the bill “goes against the dairy industry’s stated commitment to ensure that students have access to the healthiest dairy options” consistent with USDA’s and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Dietary Guidelines for Americans.Milk industry praiseThe top five milk-producing states in 2023 were California, Wisconsin, Idaho, Texas and New York, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Economic Research Service.Michael Dykes, president and CEO of the International Dairy Foods Association, celebrated House passage of the bill, which he dubbed a “defining victory for children’s health and for the dairy community that has fought for more than a decade to restore whole and 2% milk for our nation’s students.” Dykes urged Trump to sign the bill into law so that USDA “can begin working with state governments and school districts across the country to make this law a reality.”",,,,2025-12-15 16:57:36.510248

U.S. District Court Judge Christina Reiss ordered Hartness’ prison term to be followed by a 10-year supervisory period. He will be required to register as a sex offender upon his release.

Hartness was arrested in December 2024 after he was found to be in possession of child sexual abuse material between May 22 and Aug. 26, 2022. He was working for U.S. Customs and Border Protection as a border agent in northern Vermont at the time of his arrest.
After returning from a trip abroad, Hartness had his cellphone inspected at Logan International Airport in Boston in September 2022. That inspection revealed Hartness had over 350 images of potential child exploitation, according to court records.
It is not clear what prompted investigators to inspect his cellphone upon his arrival at the Boston airport.
Further investigation revealed that Hartness had been communicating with several girls online. Prosecutors wrote in court documents that the “nature and circumstances of defendant Hartness’ offense are quite troubling.”
After his arrest, Hartness was released on conditions after initially pleading not guilty. But in March, he was ordered jailed after he violated conditions of his release by trying to obtain a firearm.
During Monday’s sentencing hearing, Jonathan Ophardt, an assistant U.S. attorney, told the court that Hartness’ role as a border patrol agent was an “aggravating factor,” and urged against a lenient sentence.
In court documents, Ophardt wrote that Hartness “disgraced the uniform he wore by bringing with him to work a cell phone containing” photos of underage girls.
His crime, Ophardt said in court, “undermines the trust” the public places in law enforcement.
Hartness had requested a sentence of 12 months and one day at a facility near family in Massachusetts, according to court documents.
Emily Kenyon and Carmen Brooks, attorneys with the Office of the Federal Public Defender, noted in court documents that Hartness had no criminal history but wrote that he “acknowledges that any time he has already served does not begin to satisfy repairing the harm he caused to any victims, his family and friends, and the community at large.”
Judge Reiss told the court before sentencing that there was “a brazen element” to the crime. She later said that she was “not so sure” he understood the impact of his crime.
The judge recommended Hartness be incarcerated in a facility in Massachusetts near his family.

(Screenshot)The Providence Police Department Monday afternoon released a new video recording of an individual who resembles the person of interest captured on video leaving Brown University’s engineering building after the weekend mass shooting.
Officials shared the video on social media at 2:30 p.m., ahead of an update on their investigation scheduled for 5 p.m. at the Providence Public Safety Complex.
The new video shows a person of interest wearing all black and walking on Waterman Street at 4:06 p.m. Saturday, just one minute after the Providence Fire Department was first alerted about the shooting.
Since Saturday, the only public video available had been surveillance footage of the suspect leaving the Barus and Holley engineering building from the Hope Street side and rounding the corner onto Waterman.
Anyone who recognizes this individual, is asked by police to to contact the FBI through its online tip center or to call (401) 272-3121. 
The gunman who killed two students and wounded nine others in the engineering building on Saturday afternoon and walked out of the building remains at large. 
Law enforcement officials had detained a man who had been staying at a Coventry hotel early Sunday morning, but released him around 12:30 a.m. Monday after determining there was no evidence to tie him to the campus shooting
Providence Mayor Brett Smiley during a press conference Sunday night acknowledged the release of the initial person of interest would cause anxiety.
“I imagine that the Providence community feels a little bit more anxious than they did an hour ago, and I understand that,” Smiley said.
Providence police said officers have an “enhanced presence” in neighborhoods as investigators visit homes and businesses to request any available camera footage. 
The city of Pawtucket has similarly increased its police presence, with added details at each of the city’s public, private and charter schools.
“During times like this, our community is strongest when we stand together,” Pawtucket city and public safety officials said in a joint statement Monday.

McKee cancels holiday open house at R.I. State House
 A holiday open house planned Tuesday at the Rhode Island State House has been canceled in the aftermath of the mass shooting on the campus of Brown University over the weekend, Gov. Dan McKee’s office announced Monday.
The open house was scheduled to be held between 4:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. in place of the a traditional tree-lighting ceremony to give “a special opportunity to view the trees and other holiday decorations, enjoy festive music, and warm up with a cup of hot chocolate,” according to the event’s announcement on Dec. 5.
But McKee’s office stated Monday afternoon the open house will no longer happen “out of respect for the Providence community and the victims of the horrific shooting.”
“Our hearts and prayers continue to be with everyone impacted by this tragedy,” the governor’s office said in a statement.
McKee’s office said the public may still visit the State House to see its holiday decor during regular business hours, which are 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday.
Finals canceled at URI
The University of Rhode Island (URI), located roughly 30 miles away from Brown in Kingston, announced it has canceled all remaining in-person exams for the Fall 2025 semester.
The notice published online at 8 a.m. states there was no known threat to any of URI’s campuses, but that school officials recognized the stress and anxiety many in our community are experiencing at this time.
“In this moment, please keep our friends at Brown in your thoughts, and please continue to prioritize your well-being,” University President Marc Parlange and Barbara Wolfe, provost and executive vice president for academic affairs, wrote in their notice. “As a community, we are stronger together, and we appreciate the care, compassion, and resilience you continue to show one another.”
Campus offices will remain open, according to the university.
Family Service RI offers walk-in counseling
In response to Saturday’s shooting, Family Service of Rhode Island is making walk-in counseling at its Hope Street offices along with support services available for those experiencing fear, grief, anxiety, or emotional distress.
Walk-in support is available weekdays from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. at 55 Hope St., Providence. In addition, a 24/7 support hotline is open. Those in need of assistance from a mental health professional are encouraged to call (401) 854-6678 or 988.
“Acts of violence have deep and far-reaching emotional impacts,” Margaret Holland McDuff, CEO of Family Service of Rhode Island, said in a statement. “Even those not directly involved can experience trauma, fear, and lasting emotional distress. Young people in particular are too often asked to carry these burdens alone. Our doors are open to anyone who needs support during this painful time.”

“We urge people to know your options, to shop and compare, and to find the most affordable plan you can. We recommend that you don’t auto-renew, but really look at the new plans and premiums, because the best choice last year is not necessarily the best deal this year,” Anthony Wright, executive director of Families USA, said Monday during an event hosted by the group Florida Voices for Health.
Dec. 15 is the deadline for enrollment for Jan. 1 health insurance coverage. People can continue to enroll in the marketplace through Jan. 15 but those health insurance policies wouldn’t take effect until Feb. 1.
“And so we really do recommend that you sign up, shop, and compare, and that you continue to fight like hell for the tax credits that keep consumers covered and coverage affordable,” Wright added.
Health insurance agent Heather Stone, who has helped 3,000 people in the Tampa and southwest Florida area buy policies through the ACA exchange, is worried about people who haven’t re-enrolled or chosen a new health plan.
“We do have a lot of people who are just kind of playing possum right now and not doing anything. This is where this concerns me,” she said. At a minimum, people who don’t want to continue their health insurance policies need to ttell their insurers of their plans and to cancel auto payments.
“Or we’re going to be getting overdraft charges, right before Christmas. So, we have some concerns about the people who’ve just decided to do nothing,” Stone added.
Congress passed the enhanced premium tax credits in 2021 to further lower out-of-pocket costs for “silver” level ACA plans. The plans are named after four metals: bronze, silver, gold, and platinum. The bronze plan offers the  lowest premiums and highest out-of-pocket costs. Platinum has the highest premiums with the lowest costs.

The tax credits were part of the reason behind the federal government shutdown. They expire at the end of the year.
So far, House and Senate Republican leadership hasn’t gotten on board with any extension of those subsidies, arguing they have led to a sharp rise in the cost of health insurance. GOP lawmakers have instead pursued their own legislation but, without at least some backing from Democrats, no bill will make it through the Senate’s 60-vote procedural hurdle. 
Senate Republicans tried to advance a bill earlier this week from Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy and Idaho Sen. Mike Crapo but fell short of the votes needed. Democrats were unsuccessful trying to move their bill to extend the ACA marketplace tax credits for three years. 
The House Republican bill, sponsored by Iowa Republican Mariannette Miller-Meeks, is unlikely to break the logjam in Congress, potentially leaving the issue as one the parties can debate leading up to next year’s midterm elections. 
The elimination of the enhanced premium tax credits is hitting Florida, which leads the nation in the number of people who enroll in the federal health insurance exchange. 
Costs of health insurance across the state have increased dramatically and the number of people who have  enrolled in the federal exchange since open enrollment started has decreased. 
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services says that, as of Dec. 5, 1,686,194 Florida residents were enrolled in the exchange, which leads the nation.
For some residents in Miami, the costs of an insurance policy for a 45-year old earning $32,000 annually would have been $691 with the enhanced premium tax credit. Without the credit, the cost is $2,159. 
Some of the other striking cost jumps: A family of four earning $130,000 annually would pay $11,050 annually with the enhanced premium tax credits but $26,166 annually without the credits. And a 60-year-old couple earning $85,000 annually would pay $7,225 with the enhanced premium tax credits but $34,760 without.
“Working in those last few years before retirement, if they can afford to retire on time, they will end up paying … $27,000 more in premiums,” Florida Healthy Voices Executive Director Scott Darius and host of the Monday event said.
And the spikes in insurance aren’t limited to those living in large urban areas.
Using the same examples but for people living in the North Florida area represented by Republican Kat Cammack, Darius said the 45-year-old earning $32,000 a year would have to pay $1,468 more for their insurance without the enhanced subsidies, or a 212% increase in cost. 
A family of four would pay $17,351 more without the enhanced credits, a 157% increase in costs, and the pair of 60-year-olds would pay $30,504 more annually, a 422% increase.
“These are very real numbers impacting people and Floridians especially, as they grapple with their priorities for next year and their budgets for next year,” Darius said.  “It’s leading people to forego coverage altogether, to settle for lower-tiered plans, or to make huge sacrifices in other parts of their life so they can keep the coverage that they have.”
Small business owner Carlos Otero, 60, has relied on the Affordable Care Act for years. He said the funding cuts and restructuring of USAID, the U.S. government agency, wreaked havoc on his small business, which he said used to work a lot with Latin American countries.
“This health crisis has been terrible for everyone in my family,” said Otero, a Latin American market research consultant who lives in Miami who moved to the area during the COVID pandemic to help care for his mother. 
“This year, it came with a surprise of 900% incremental spike in my premiums and my monthly premiums, which is … already crazy from all the problems that you already have, or we already have, doing to my business,” he said. “So, obviously, having affordable care is not just an option, it’s very important.”
Otero said the spike in premiums forced him to find a different plan.
“But it will come with a cost. I will need to make choices,” he said, adding that he’s already a “senior.”
“A young senior, but I’m a senior. And I’m going to be needing more and more preventive care that I think I’m going to probably postpone if my co-payments and everything are not as they used to be,” he said. “I mean, we need the Congress to act now, not later, and extend those credits.”
Otero called it a “no-brainer.”
Lynnette Bidwell, 58, who spent 42 years working in retail management, agreed.

“I showed up every day, supporting my team, helping my customers, and doing everything I could to build a stable life. For all those years, I had health insurance through my employers. I never expected my health to decline to the point where I could no longer afford to work full-time, but that is where I found myself. I now receive Social Security Disability insurance.”
After losing her employer-sponsored coverage, Bidwell, who is divorced, enrolled in the Affordable Care Act marketplace, or exchange. With the help of an ACA “navigator,” she found coverage, a Florida Blue HMO plan that gave her continued access to the physicians she saw on her employer-sponsored plan.
“Everything changed when I went back this fall to renew for 2026. My navigator and I expected a routine renewal. Instead, we both gasped. My Florida Blue HMO silver plan, the same plan with the same benefits, went up 589%. On a limited income, that dump is just impossible.”
She said she’s been forced to switch plans, which means losing the primary care provider she’s had for more than 10 years.
“Losing him is devastating. Starting over with someone new is overwhelming. It’s just not a doctor’s appointment. It’s losing someone who understands me deeply, and knows when something is wrong by just looking at me. The emotional impact is real,” she said.
“I know I’m not alone. Many people in Florida and across the country are being priced out of their plans.”
Stone says she has “several” married clients between the ages of 59 and 64 who are considering leaving the country or going to get services abroad. Other clients are looking for health insurance plans that can be medically underwritten, such as short-term health insurance.
“And most of these people are working. They’ve done everything right. They have worked, they’re small business owners. They own restaurants, or they’ve worked for a small business that has 10 or less employees, and they have to go to the marketplace for coverage.”

(Stock photo by Luis Alvarez/Getty Images)As notices go to consumers informing them of what the price will be without the effect of the Affordable Care Act’s enhanced tax credits, Americans are experiencing sticker shock.
For those with disabilities, it is a sticker shock that ripples through every other aspect of their life.
Will they be able to work, afford the health care that keeps them able to work and able to be as independent as possible?
It is imperative that Congress find a path forward to ensure the extension of the credits before they expire Dec. 31. South Carolinians have even less time given that many plans require a lock-in date of Dec. 15 to go into effect by Jan. 1.
For example, one 38-year-old disabled veteran in South Carolina has a spinal cord injury and post-traumatic stress disorder and uses the Veterans Affairs health care system for care. However, the specialists he needs are over an hour away, so he also relies on a plan in the federal online marketplace to see local providers.
In 2025, this veteran’s private health insurance plan cost $96 a month and covered his local doctor, therapist, and the only nearby physical therapist trained in spinal cord injuries.
Should the expanded tax credits go away, this veteran’s premium jumps to $421 a month — a 339% increase — due to higher rehab and equipment costs, fewer insurers in his area, the loss of certain subsidy protections, and rising demand for mental-health and chronic-care services.
The new premium alone would take about 20% of his monthly income, forcing him to choose between rent, food, and care. He would begin skipping therapy and delaying appointments, relying more on the distant Veterans Affairs doctors even though travel is painful and difficult.
Republicans in Congress have long championed policies that strengthen families, promote work, and lift barriers to independence, including the Americans with Disabilities Act.
One of the most effective ways to uphold those principles is by extending the Affordable Care Act premium tax credits quickly before the uncertainty raised by the lack of the credits forces people to make choices that undermine their health and ability to be as independent as possible.
Without affordable health insurance, medical debt will rise, severely impacting those who already have higher out-of-pocket costs for medications, medical equipment and other services.
The credits in place now help reduce uncompensated care, preventing cost-shifting onto taxpayers. They assist in the stability of the insurance marketplaces.
Without the tax credits and affordable health insurance, the options for individuals with disabilities are often to rely on public programs or to go without insurance.
Unfortunately, whatever the flaws of the status quo, relying on public programs or simply going without will only increase federal spending on health services through increasing public program costs or spending on uncompensated care and treating individuals when they are sicker and more expensive.

Janet Mills gives State of the State address at the Maine State House in Augusta on Jan. 30, 2024. (Photo by Jim Neuger/Maine Morning Star)Gov. Janet Mills will allow legislation restricting local authorities from carrying out federal immigration enforcement to become law.
Mills also formally repealed a 2011 executive order issued by former Republican Gov. Paul LePage that had called for enhanced cooperation between state and federal officials on immigration enforcement. 
Announcing these decisions in an op-ed published in the Portland Press Herald on Monday afternoon, Mills wrote, “Maine is making clear what we believe: that the federal government should overhaul a failed immigration system that is trapping law-abiding people in the shadows, that it should target criminals who actually pose a danger to public safety, not schoolchildren and their parents, and that no one will make us abandon our neighbors based on the color of their skin or the country they once, if ever, called home.” 
The legislation, LD 1971, places restrictions on enforcement activities absent formal agreements with federal authorities, which is currently the case for all Maine law enforcement agencies.
Local police are not required to and generally do not have the authority to enforce immigration laws, but the Trump administration revived a program called 287(g), which deputizes local police officers to detain immigrants. Maine currently has no such agreements after the Wells Police Department — the only local agency that had entered into such a contract — canceled its agreement this fall following public opposition. 
LD 1971 passed both chambers last spring — by just one vote in the House of Representatives and seven in the Senate — following substantial changes. 
After some members of law enforcement raised concern about the proposal hindering federal partnerships that sometimes touch on some immigration issues, such as drug enforcement task forces, the bill was amended so that only work done by local police for the primary purpose of immigration enforcement would be banned. For example, it prevents state and local law enforcement from detaining someone solely on the basis of a federal immigration-related request. 
But Mills postponed deciding on the matter, leaving her with the option to either veto the bill or allow it to become law without her signature when lawmakers reconvene in January. 
Mills’ pledge on Monday to allow it to become law does not come without hesitation. The former district attorney and attorney general wrote that she is concerned about the restraints in the bill being confusing but that she agrees with its aim of ensuring that Maine law enforcement is enforcing state laws, not federal immigration law.
“LD 1971 is imperfect, and we should not need it,” Mills wrote, “but the times call for it.”
In her reasoning for overturning LePage’s executive order, Mills similarly emphasized that her decision was rooted in concerns about responding to the current moment.
“Under any other president, this may be acceptable,” Mills wrote of cooperation between local and federal officials on immigration enforcement, “but under this Trump administration, it has become a broad and dangerous promise that Maine will not make.”
Meanwhile, the sponsor of LD 1971, Rep. Deqa Dhalac (D-South Portland), criticized Mills for delaying her decision. The bill won’t take effect until 90 days after the Legislature adjourns, which is currently slated for April 15. 
“When the Legislature enacted this bill last June, we made it clear that defining the boundaries between state law enforcement and federal immigration authorities was critical to safeguarding our communities,” Dhalac wrote in a statement. 
Dhalac said local police involvement in federal immigration enforcement erodes public trust, making everyone less safe. Maine House Republicans condemned the governor’s decision, writing in a statement that allowing the bill to become law “shows a reckless disregard for public safety” and “weakens efforts to prevent violent crime.”
During floor discussions, Republicans also argued it would make Maine a target in light of Trump conducting immigration raids in so-called sanctuary jurisdictions and threatening to withhold federal funding, with a few quoting Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins regarding the latter point.
In a statement shared with Maine Morning Star at the time, Collins’ press secretary Blake Kernan said, “Senator Collins’s office does not have a position on state legislation. But, in conversations with legislators, our staff discussed the potential federal funding for state and local law enforcement that this legislation would put at risk.” 
Immigrant rights groups such as the Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project and the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine have heard from clients fearful of contacting law enforcement for emergency services because of the possibility they will loop in federal immigration authorities.  
“LD 1971 draws a clear line between the role of Maine’s state and local police and the Trump administration’s political immigration enforcement agenda,” ILAP’s executive director Sue Roche said in a statement Monday. “It ensures that Maine’s resources aren’t being diverted to further terrorize individuals and families, rip workers out of their jobs, destroy public trust, and create chaos and fear.”
​​Michael Kebede, policy director for the ACLU of Maine, said in a statement that the bill will ensure Maine towns aren’t “complicit in or liable for federal abuses of power.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Mills-SOTS-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-12-15 16:57:36.510248

The FDA defines drugs on the list, such as heroin and cocaine, as lacking any medicinal value and carrying a high likelihood of abuse.The designation carries a host of consequences, including a virtual ban on funding research for medicinal or other uses of the drug.While marijuana use, both medicinal and recreational, is legal in many states, it remains illegal to possess or use in any amount for any reason under federal law.Advocates have sought for decades to legalize or decriminalize the drug, which many see as less harmful than other Schedule I substances.The growing split in recent years among many states and federal law has ramped up pressure on federal policymakers to alter the drug’s legal status.Marijuana businesses in states where it is legal lack access to financial institutions, which cannot lend to businesses considered illegal by federal authorities.States, meanwhile, have had difficulty regulating the environmental and health aspects of their industries.And lawmakers, especially Democrats, have increasingly highlighted the frequent injustice of marijuana prosecutions that disproportionately affect communities of color and poor communities, though the drug is widely used across race and economic status.",,,,2025-12-15 16:57:36.510248

An argument with the Census becomes a reminder that ancestry and citizenship are not the same thing.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Jay Stroud: Citizenship isn’t ancestry. It’s birth or naturalization..","This is a true story. Some years ago, I failed to complete a United States Census form correctly, and my error prompted an official call. “What,” the Census employee asked me,” is your ‘country of origin?’”
I responded without hesitation. “The United States. America. Here. Our country.”  
“No,” she replied. “That’s not correct. Before that. Everyone’s from somewhere.”  
“Well,” I replied. “As far back as I know, it’s America. My fourth great grandfather is buried in East Brookfield, Vermont, and my great great Grandfather is buried in Haverhill, NH.  Before that, another long-ago grandfather was born in Ipswich, Massachusetts in 1642, and his grandson, my fifth great grandfather, fought in the Revolutionary War. So I’m a citizen of America.”  
The Census employee was hardly impressed. “Well,” she said, “there is no category for ‘America’ as a ‘country of origin.’”
“How is that possible?” I replied. “It’s America. How can there be no official option to choose America as your ‘country of origin?’”
“Are you Native American?” she asked, Her professional duties obviously required persistence and patience. 
“No,” I responded. “I don’t go that far back, I’m pretty sure.”
“Well,” she said, “so what is your ‘country of origin?’  The Census form does ask you for a ‘Place of Birth,’ so that can be the United States. You could say that. That’s citizenship not a country of origin.”
This conversation occurred around the time Meryl Streep had said, evidently to some controversy, that “We’re all from Africa, originally…” So I repeated that. “If, over time. you never lose where you’re from originally, I guess you’d have to say Africa then, at least from what I know about humanity’s origin story.” 
Undeterred, she said, “So are you African American?”  
“Well,” I replied, “probably not in the sense I imagine you intend your question.” 
I was being annoying and she was finally exasperated with me. She undoubtedly had better things to do. There was a slight pause before she said, “Now, you’re being obstreperous.”
She was right. I was. At the moment, I lacked the wit to understand this federal form wasn’t a bureaucratic cul-de-sac but a celebration of wisdom. I should have respected the United States Census on its face. No matter how long any family may have lived in the United States, it’s still not your “country of origin” unless one is Native American.  
The U.S. Census recognizes birth or naturalization as the avenues to citizenship. “Citizenship,” the Census declares to this day, is defined not by how long your family has lived here but where you were on the day you were born or naturalized.  
I’m just grateful to be a citizen together with all my fellow first-generation neighbors.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Sen. Shelley Moore Capito plans to seek re-election to the U.S. Senate, announcing her campaign with a video that touts her support for President Donald Trump and his agenda.
Capito, 72, is fourth-highest ranking member of the Republican-controlled Senate and chairs the Environment and Public Works Committee. 

“I’m asking for your vote so I can continue to work with President Trump to make our nation stronger, deliver for West Virginia and our people, and stand for our principles, our freedoms and our way of life in the Mountain State,” Capito said in an announcement on Monday. 
She is seeking re-election in 2026.
Elected to the U.S. Senate in 2014, Capito is the first female U.S. senator in West Virginia’s history. She is the daughter of three-term West Virginia governor and U.S. representative Arch Moore.
Trump has endorsed Capito’s re-election.
The campaign video said that Capito has supported the president’s immigration crackdown and confirmed Trump’s U.S. Supreme Court nominees, building a conservative court.
Capito has also championed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, and the video announcement said West Virignian taxpayers could keep more of their hard-earned money.
An independent analysis by the nonprofit Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy found that many West Virginia households will see their taxes increase compared to what they are paying now, and their report didn’t factor in the bill’s changes to Medicaid that will cause around 60,000 West Virginians to lose coverage over the next decade. 
Capito has more than $4 million in cash on hand for her re-election run, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission.
A primary opponent, state Sen. Tom Willis, R-Berkeley, has around $156,000 cash on hand. Willis was recently appointed to lead the state Senate’s Judiciary Committee.
Other Republicans are registered to run for the U.S. Senate seat, including Alexander Gaaserud of Parkersburg and Janet McNulty of Martinsburg. Neither candidate has any cash on hand, according to federal election filings. 
A Democratic challenger, Zach Shrewsbury, has $17,644 cash on hand.

BURLINGTON — A court-ordered psychiatric evaluation for a man accused of shooting and wounding three Palestinian students more than two years ago in Burlington has found him competent to stand trial. 
Attorneys for the defendant, Jason Eaton, said during a brief court hearing Monday morning in Chittenden County Superior criminal court that they would be seeking their own evaluation of their client.
Eaton has been held in custody without bail since his November 2023 arraignment on three counts of attempted second-degree murder.

Eaton, according to charging documents, shot the three young men as they were walking on North Prospect Street in Burlington on the evening of Nov. 25, 2023. The three men — Hisham Awartani, Kinnan Abdalhamid and Tahseen Aliahmad — had been visiting friends and family in the area over Thanksgiving.  
The three men attended colleges outside Vermont and did not know Eaton, who police alleged came at them from a porch and, without saying anything, and shot all three. The three men at the time of the shooting were wearing keffiyehs, a traditional scarf that is a symbol of Palestinian identity.
A motive for the shootings has not been revealed and, despite calls for the incident to be prosecuted as hate crimes, the prosecutor has said no evidence has emerged to support that distinction.
The report discussed in court Monday followed an earlier one ordered by the court last year that also found Eaton competent to stand trial. Eaton’s defense asked for another review of his competency during a hearing earlier this year when Eaton said that he had been acting under the instructions of government agencies.
Eaton, 50, took part in Monday’s hearing by video from the Northern State Correctional Facility in Newport. He did not speak during the proceeding. 
One of the men shot, Awartani, had a bullet lodged in his spine and was left paralyzed from the chest down. The two other men were treated for less severe injuries at the hospital and later released.
The latest report from the court-ordered psychological evaluation is not public but the findings were briefly referenced by the judge and defense attorney during the hearing. Few other details about the 72-page report were brought up at the hearing. 
Margaret Mary Jansch, one of Eaton’s attorneys, told Judge John Pacht that she would be seeking a separate psychological evaluation by their own expert.
Pacht said another status hearing in the case would be set in 60 days. The judge added that he was seeking to have the case ready to move to a trial by late spring. 
Jansch told the judge that before a trial she anticipated filing a motion to move the case out of Chittenden County.

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)After a sleepless night with the sounds of sirens and TV news about Saturday’s Brown University mass shooting, Daniel Morris was on the hunt early Sunday for a morning coffee and pastry when he saw the social media post.
The Rhode Island Blood Center needed donations. Morris needed a distraction. 


How to give blood
Appointments are encouraged. To make an appointment online to donate through one of the Rhode Island Blood Center’s donation centers or mobile clinics. 
The donation center at 405 Promenade St., Providence, will operate on extended hours from 7 a.m to 7 p.m. through Thursday, and 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Friday.


“I just showed up,” the 31-year-old Providence resident said. “I needed to do something.”
He was not the only one. By the time Morris arrived at the community nonprofit’s Providence Promenade Street headquarters and donation center at noon, the waiting room was filled. People spilled over into a makeshift overflow area.
“In my 22 years, I’ve never seen a response like this,” Executive Director Nicole Pineault said in a phone interview on Monday. “It has been truly heartwarming and incredible to see the community support us in this way.”
Roughly 330 people donated blood or platelets across the blood center’s four donation centers — Providence, Warwick, Woonsocket and Middletown — more than triple the 100-person average for a Sunday, said spokesperson Chelsey Smith. More than one third of Sunday’s donations came from first-time donors.
Another 650 people booked appointments for future donations, compared with the typical 75 appointments scheduled on a Sunday.
By Monday afternoon, another 200 people gave blood donations at the Providence donation center, including U.S. Rep. Seth Magaziner, who posted about his experience on X.

The blood center was already low on supply before the mass shooting Saturday that killed two students and injured nine more people. Winter cold and snow, holiday travel and illness suppress donation levels at this time every year, Smith said. At the same time, the need for blood increases in the colder months, with those same factors — travel and bad weather — leading to more traffic accidents that necessitate blood transfusions at local hospitals. 
“We see a drastic decline in donations and blood drives,” Pineault said. “We really struggle. In the winter, things are really stacked against us.”
Participation through business or community blood drives has failed to fully rebound since the COVID-19 pandemic, leaving the nonprofit already at lower donation levels before seasonal drops begin.

All hands on deck
The blood center put out a call for donations on social media at 7 a.m. Sunday, just after sending off 120 units of blood, platelets and plasma from prior donations to Rhode Island Hospital, where nine people were being treated for injuries from the shooting. Two Brown University students were killed when a gunman dressed in black opened fire in the Ivy League’s engineering building during final exams Saturday afternoon. He has not been identified or located as of Monday afternoon.
‘We have not yet solved this case.’ Officials say person of interest to be released.

Many of the donors who responded to the call for action were residents living near campus, faculty and students.
 “Students who had been on lockdown on their campus, sheltering in place, were walking through the snow across downtown Providence to give,” Smith said. 
The crowd at the Providence donation center remained several dozen strong throughout Sunday and into Monday, ensuring all 13 donation beds were full for the 12-hour donation window each day.
Blood center employees came in on their day off, or added hours, working into the night after the donation center doors closed to prepare the blood for transfer and to finish processing the paperwork required for new donors, Smith said.
“We really do have a staff that wants to be a part of the emergency response, so we’re fortunate to have an all hands on deck thing,” Smith said. 
For donors, too, spirits remained high despite what for some were hourlong waiting times.
“I think this is something people can focus on right now and feel good about it at a time of tragedy,” Pineault said. “Unfortunately it’s times like this where we’re all reminded of the importance of having a steady and reliable blood supply. Most of the time, people take for granted it’s going to be there. Moments like this allow us to highlight the fact that we need to be ready.”
From the waiting room, Morris said he watched two Brown University students begin what looked to him like a “meet cute,” or flirtatious first encounter. He welcomed the chance to set aside the weight of the mass shooting temporarily.
The blood center is especially looking for Type O donors, who can donate red blood cells to anybody, along with Type B-, Smith said.
The blood center’s Providence donation center will continue to operate on extended hours this week. However, donors are asked to book appointments online rather than walking in due to the increased demand. 
“We’re going to need blood not just for the victims of this violence but also just everyday patients,” Smith said. 
Embracing the surge in late-season donors, the blood center has readied its snack cabinets with extra Nutter Butters, Lorna Doones, soft drinks and fruit juices, contributed by New York Blood Center Enterprises, the umbrella nonprofit that oversees a network of regional blood centers, including in Rhode Island.

Ned Lamont said Monday he is making a withdrawal from the $500 million emergency reserve fund created last month to offset federal cuts, using at least $5.2 million to counter the immediate impact of a far larger reduction in federal support for homelessness programs.
The projected loss to Connecticut is $70 million over the fiscal year that runs until October, but Connecticut and other states have sued, seeking a reversal of the cuts and other policy changes abruptly made in November by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. An initial ruling could come this month.
“This stopgap funding is just a protection in place. We want the federal government to fill this gap,” said Sarah Fox, chief executive of the Connecticut Coalition to End Homelessness.
Midway through a two-year planning and funding cycle for “continuum of care” programs serving individuals struggling to retain or regain housing, HUD scrapped the existing programs and set a tight deadline for applying for the new, dramatically smaller pool of funds.
“They gave zero notice,” Fox said. “You have basically around two months to complete your application, but you have one month to do all the community planning, and they told you they were cutting 70% of your resources.”
The withdrawal is the second Lamont is making from the emergency reserve. Last week, he committed $70 million to partly offset the expected loss of $295 million in enhanced federal tax credits that subsidize health insurance premiums for thousands of residents under the Affordable Care Act.
“I’m finding these moments of crisis are the new norm,” Lamont said Monday.
Voting in a special session last month, the General Assembly set aside $500 million in surplus funds and authorized Lamont to unilaterally use the money under certain circumstances, barring objections by a committee of legislative leaders.
Lamont spoke at a press conference at Liberty Community Services in New Haven with U.S. Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro, D-3rd District, Mayor Justin Elicker, Fox and other advocates and service providers. DeLauro has filed legislation requiring HUD to renew all continuum of care grants for one year to avoid further disruption.
“We’re here because President Trump is making life more dangerous and more difficult for our most vulnerable populations, people who are trying to keep a roof over their heads during the coldest months of the year,” said DeLauro, the dean of the state’s congressional delegation.

Aside from the 70% cut in the $100 million Connecticut expected to get in HUD funding to address homelessness, the Trump administration is turning away from the “housing first” policies of the past two decades, faulting them for a growth in chronic homelessness and street encampments.
“This new framework is the first step toward righting those failures with increased funding for those high performing programs that have demonstrated real success and accountability,” HUD said in a statement last month.
Jim Pettinelli, the executive director of Liberty Community Services, said research shows that “housing first” provides the stability necessary for the chronically homeless, addressing contributing factors such as mental illness, addiction and other health challenges. Previously, access to housing had to be “earned,” he said.
 “And in the ’90s, folks said, ‘Wait a minute, let’s look at that. Why shouldn’t we be offering people housing first and then wrapping services around them to help them be successful in their tenancy, in reconstructing their lives?’ ”
Fox agreed.
“I will tell you that the homes that we provide and the stability that is provided through that housing is critical for the lives of our community members,” she said.
The Trump administration also is ending some of the separate housing funding for groups assisting victims of domestic violence.
“And so what will happen for the first time is that the DV [domestic violence] system and the homeless system are going to be competing against each other, for a smaller amount of money,” said Meghan Scanlon, the chief executive of the Connecticut Coalition Against Domestic Violence.
Seila Mosquera-Bruno, the state commissioner of housing, said 34 service providers that get federal continuum of care funding through her agency, the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services, or directly from HUD are facing a loss of funding after contracts expire, beginning on Dec. 31.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/00D95DA3-5873-499E-9F33-B6822FFE8D25-1024x828.jpg,,,2025-12-15 16:57:36.510248

(Photo: Greg Childress/NC Newsline)The North Carolina Supreme Court issued a new round of opinions last week, but once again left unresolved the Leandro school funding case, a decades-old legal fight over the state’s obligation to provide a “sound, basic education” to its public school students.
The Leandro case dates back to 1994, when five low-wealth, rural counties sued the state over insufficient school funding. In 1997, the North Carolina Supreme Court ruled that the state was violating students’ constitutional right to a sound, basic education, a decision that has been upheld multiple times since.  
Democrats controlled the legislature until 2011, but did not provide the funding needed to solve the problem. In recent years, Republicans have similarly declined to appropriate the full amount called for by a remedial plan..  
The most recent substantive ruling came in November 2022, when the court ordered the General Assembly to fund the first two years of the Comprehensive Remedial Plan. After the court shifted to a 5-2 Republican majority in 2023, the justices granted Republican lawmakers’ request to reconsider that decision. 
The court heard oral arguments in February 2024 but has yet to issue a final ruling. The case has now been pending at the state Supreme Court for more than 600 days. 
Republican lawmakers have argued that the state constitution gives the legislature alone the power to decide how taxpayer money is spent, and that courts lack the authority to tell them how to spend it. 
The delay is not just a legal limbo, advocates say: it has worsened the financial and staffing crisis across the state’s public schools. North Carolina ranks near the bottom nationally when it comes to teacher pay and per-pupil funding.
In a virtual press conference Monday, advocates and parents said the court’s prolonged inaction is depriving 1.5 million students of critical resources.
“There is one word that defines what is happening right now, and I want everyone to remember this word: neglect,” said Tamika Walker Kelly, president of the North Carolina Association of Educators. “They neglected their needs for books and classrooms. They neglected their need for school counselors and nurses in our buildings. They neglected the need for us to have safe buildings, smaller class sizes and educators who are supported, not exhausted and burnt out.”
Sharita Jones, a teacher from Vance County, one of the original communities that filed the suit, said that fully funding the plan would directly address these shortfalls. “The heart of Leandro is simple: every child in North Carolina deserves access to a sound basic education no matter their zip code. Fully funding Leandro would mean smaller class sizes, more support staff such as counselors, social workers and nurses, and competitive pay that allows us to recruit and retain strong educators,” she said.
Melissa Price Kromm, executive director of N.C. For The People Action and a longtime voting rights advocate, recounted the impact of underfunding on her 10-year-old daughter’s education. “My daughter didn’t have a teacher for nearly half of this past school year, and before that, she went through most of kindergarten without a teacher. We are still working to close the gaps in her education because of it,” she said.
“The remedy is not a mystery,” Kromm added. “North Carolina has a court-ordered comprehensive remedial plan that lays out exactly what is needed. The courts have said they must fund it, but year after year, the General Assembly has refused to comply fully.”
Rep. Julie von Haefen (D-Wake) has spent the past six years introducing bills to fully fund the plan, but the Republican-controlled House has blocked them. 
Organizers closed the virtual press conference by calling for broader civic engagement and pressure on state lawmakers. 
“Speaking up and speaking out is going to take more than just educators,” Jones said. “People in support have to start letting lawmakers know their concerns and informing others who may not know what’s going on.”

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)North Carolina has launched its program to repair rental properties damaged by Hurricane Helene.
The program, which will be funded with federal grant dollars, began accepting applications Monday morning. Owners of properties with one to four rental units are eligible. If they participate in the program, they must agree to provide “affordable” rent rates in those units for a decade.
Stephanie McGarrah, who leads the N.C. Department of Commerce division overseeing housing recovery, said the program will “deliver critical relief for the rental housing supply in western North Carolina.”
The small rental rebuild program is the first step in the state’s multi-family housing recovery effort. Grants will total just over $57 million, with projects receiving anywhere from $250,000 to $1.5 million. It will be a “first come, first serve” program, with no set deadline.
A separate program to build new, larger rental housing projects will launch next year, according to state officials. That program will use about $134 million from the same pool of federal money.
In the year since Helene, advocates and officials in western North Carolina have pushed state and federal leaders to provide more aid for renters. The state’s program, in requiring affordable rates, aims to do that — in a region that has seen high costs of living even before the storm.
To qualify for the small rental program, property owners will be required to lease a project’s units to tenants with a household income of 80% or less of the area’s median income. They also have to follow separate federal limits on rent costs.
It remains to be seen how many applications the state will receive for the small rental program. “We don’t know yet what the demand is,” McGarrah told the governor’s advisory committee Monday. 
Those looking to apply for the program and for more details can visit apply.renewnc.org.
State sends infrastructure money to local governments
Gov. Josh Stein’s office also announced 80 grants for local governments to repair and replace storm-damaged infrastructure on Monday.
The grants are part of a state program allocated by the legislature, designed to pay for $50 million in key projects that are either not eligible for or were denied federal aid.
Stein’s state budget director Kristin Walker said in a news release that there’s high demand for the money. The Office of State Budget and Management received grant applications totaling “more than twice the amount of available funding,” Walker said. 
Among the grants: just under $2.5 million to relocate a fleet management facility in Haywood County, $2.1 million for a Henderson County sewer project and $1.3 million in utility improvements in the town of Beech Mountain.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — An advocacy group that represents licensed child care providers is asking an Oklahoma County judge to force a state agency to restore a pandemic-era subsidy program.
The Licensed Child Care Association of Oklahoma sued the Oklahoma Department of Human Services last week in Oklahoma County District Court, seeking an emergency injunction that would require the agency to continue to pay a $5 per child, per day subsidy for school-age children.
The lawsuit was filed after the state agency notified providers in October that the one-time federal relief funding had been exhausted and DHS could no longer afford to continue the full program. 
The child care providers group is alleging the state agency failed to follow proper rule-making procedure, as outlined in state statute, when ending the subsidy that was created during the COVID-19 pandemic in an effort to increase provider reimbursement rates and expand access for families.
New applications and renewals for child care subsidies are paused and the “$5 per day COVID-era add-on incentive for school-age children” ended Nov. 1 because of funding lost during the government shutdown, which lasted 43 days, according to the agency’s website. Subsidies are unaffected for children in foster care, adoptions, children with disabilities who are approved for a special needs rate and the unhoused population. 
“Because nearly 75% of Oklahoma Human Services funding comes from federal sources, we must adjust the Child Care Subsidy program to preserve available resources for as long as possible,” the agency website said. 
A spokesperson for the DHS declined to comment on pending litigation. The agency is requesting $70 million in funding from the Oklahoma Legislature in an effort to “stabilize” the child care industry and “prevent future funding cliffs,” according to a news release. 
“The system cannot continue to swing between emergency funding and emergency cuts,” agency director Jeffrey Cartmell said in the news release. “Oklahomans need reliable, high-quality child care access for working families, and stable funding is the only way forward.”
During the pandemic, the state received federal dollars for child care incentives, but those funds are exhausted and no replacement appropriations have been approved to sustain those expansions, the agency said.
Eve Spaulding, an attorney representing the child care advocacy group, said the agency didn’t follow the proper process to end these subsidies. 
“We’re asking the judge to just put a temporary halt on things,” she said. “To put a pause on their elimination of all payments and let this either work its way through the court system or let them go back and do what they’re required to do by state statute.”
Spaulding said the state agency announced the change in subsidies in an email sent to providers Oct. 30. The Licensed Child Care Association of Oklahoma posted the content of the email on Facebook, which attributes the need to end the subsidies to the “prolonged shutdown.”
“Our concern is, not only does this impact facilities and the child care facilities, but it impacts families,” Spaulding said. “It impacts the Oklahoma workforce. When parents don’t have a safe place for their child to go, what are the ramifications of that? Children left alone, children put in less than safe circumstances. It’s a crisis and it’s hard to measure how that impact will work.” 
A preliminary injunction hearing will be held at 10 a.m. Thursday.

(Photo by Anne-Marie Caruso/New Jersey Monitor)Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill has chosen an ex-prosecutor, former assistant attorney general, and top lawyer for PSE&G to be the state’s next attorney general.
Jen Davenport is the second person Sherrill has chosen to lead her cabinet when she becomes governor on Jan. 20. The first, Lt. Gov.-elect Dale Caldwell, will be secretary of state.
Sherrill, speaking to reporters in Newark alongside Davenport and Caldwell, said Davenport has the respect and trust of law enforcement and of the communities they serve. During her campaign for governor, Sherrill told police officers she would appoint an attorney general “who works well with law enforcement.”
“I know she will stop at nothing to ensure justice is served to everyone,” Sherrill said Monday.
Davenport said as attorney general, she plans to address gun violence and human trafficking, ensure affordability, and defend the state from “attacks out of Washington.”
“One of the greatest threats to affordability is coming from Washington, which is issuing policies that raise the costs on everything from housing to health insurance to household goods. So when the folks in Washington issue policies that drive up costs or otherwise harm our residents or violate the Constitution, I will be there alongside the governor-elect protecting you,” Davenport said.

Davenport would replace the current attorney general, Matt Platkin, who praised Sherrill’s choice.
“Jen is, without question, one of the finest public servants I have ever known, and will do an extraordinary job as our State’s chief law enforcement officer,” Platkin said in a statement.
Davenport’s nomination must be approved by the Senate’s judiciary committee and then the full Senate. Sens. Vin Gopal (D-Monmouth) and Declan O’Scanlon (R-Monmouth) said in a joint statement that they support her selection and will work with their colleagues in the Senate to confirm her. Because the two men represent Davenport’s home county, their support is critical to her nomination moving forward.
Davenport served as first assistant attorney general for four years in the state Attorney General’s Office during Gov. Phil Murphy’s first term. After leaving that office, she joined PSE&G as a director and now serves as deputy counsel and chief litigation counsel. She also worked at the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and as an assistant U.S. attorney in the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey for seven years. 
A Monmouth County resident and mother of two children, Davenport graduated from DeSales University and Seton Hall University School of Law.

(Getty Images)Attorney General Todd Rokita is suing about 50 sexually explicit websites, alleging they have violated Indiana’s age-verification law.
The lawsuits allege that the content made available to children by the defendants — all of whom are associated with a multinational pornographic conglomerate known as Aylo — includes sexual violence, choking, rape fantasies, sex slavery and sex with teen girls.
“We know for a fact, from years of research, that adolescent exposure to pornography carries severe physical and psychological harms,” Rokita said. “It makes boys more likely to perpetrate sexual violence and girls more likely to be sexually victimized. Yet, despite such realities, these defendants seem intent on peddling their pornographic perversions to Hoosier kids.”
Lawmakers in 2024 passed the law requiring websites that host pornography to verify that users are at least 18 years old. As a result, Pornhub, which is owned by Aylo, blocked access to the site in Indiana.
Challenges to the law were ultimately unsuccessful.
“Rather than implement any form of reasonable age verification for its websites, Defendants represented to Indiana consumers, including Hoosier parents, that they had ‘completely disable[d] access to our website[s] in Indiana.’ However, Defendants have publicly admitted they know that Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), proxies, and location spoofing software may be used to continue to access Defendants’ websites in Indiana,” the lawsuit said.
In addition to Indiana’s age-verification law, Rokita’s lawsuit also alleges the defendants violated the state’s Deceptive Consumer Sales Act in several ways:
1) by making false and misleading statements regarding the accessibility of the pornographic websites by Indiana residents and 2) by misleading consumers about their alleged hosting of child sexual abuse material and nonconsensual material.
The attorney general’s office is seeking an injunction, civil penalties and costs.
“Despite these known harms to minors, the Defendants’ websites are pumping enormous amounts of pornographic content onto the internet, where minors can and do freely access it,” the lawsuit said.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/porn-xxx-computer-crop-getty-1024x5761685750894-1.jpg,,,2025-12-15 15:56:57.208794

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)Maine asked the district court to throw out the lawsuit from President Donald Trump’s Department of Justice over the state refusing to turn over sensitive voter data. 
The motion to dismiss, filed in the U.S. District Court of Maine by Attorney General Aaron Frey on Dec. 12 on behalf of the state, argues that the lawsuit should be discharged in its entirety because the DOJ failed to support a valid legal case as to why it is justified to such information, and that its information requests violate federal privacy law. 
Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, a Democrat who is running for governor in 2026, has twice rejected these requests, which have demanded Maine’s full voter registration list — including all fields, such as driver’s license numbers, partial social security numbers and full dates of birth — along with names of officials who handle the list’s maintenance, the number of ineligible voters the state identified due to noncitizenship and voter registration applications from  specific time periods, among other information.  
In September, the DOJ sued Maine and Oregon for not turning over the information and has since launched lawsuits against roughly half a dozen other states. 
As the Trump administration requested this data, federal officials acknowledged that the Department of Justice shared voter roll information with Homeland Security to search it for noncitizens. Bellows and other secretaries of state have raised concern about the federal government using voter records for citizenship probes. 
“Maine elections are free, safe and secure,” Bellows said in a statement Monday, “and we will continue to fight the gross federal overreach so that they remain so.” 
According to the DOJ, the lawsuit against Maine alleges the state and Bellows violated the National Voter Registration Act, the Help America Vote Act and the Civil Rights Act of 1960 by refusing to provide “data regarding the removal of ineligible individuals and to produce an unredacted, computerized state voter registration list.”
In the motion to dismiss, the state of Maine claims the DOJ misused those acts in its arguments, adding, “Were this not enough (and it is), DOJ’s demand also blatantly violates the federal Privacy Act of 1974, the post-Watergate law enacted to prevent precisely the sort of secret compilation of data on Americans’ First Amendment activities that DOJ appears to be attempting here.” 
Voter registration databases contain information about people’s choice of political party and in which elections they chose to vote, which are activities protected by the First Amendment, the motion points out. 
Also on Monday, the District Court of Maine accepted an amicus curiae, or friend of the court, brief in this case from American Civil Liberties Union of Maine and the ACLU Voting Rights Project. 
These groups joined Bellows in fighting the lawsuit, specifically arguing in their brief that the federal government’s demand for the sensitive voter information violates the language and purpose of federal voting law and state privacy law and that the request should therefore be denied and the lawsuit dismissed. 
“Maine voters have shared this sensitive information so they can exercise their right to vote, but they never agreed to let the federal government access that information and ignore the law,” Zach Heiden, chief counsel at the ACLU of Maine, said in a statement. 
Heiden said these federal requests undermine data privacy and voter trust, which can depress turnout and serve “as the basis for patently false and dangerous claims.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/election-day-2025-8-Large-1024x682.jpeg,,,2025-12-15 15:56:57.208794

Will new laws come in 2026?,CT Mirror's Long Story Short,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/15/podcast-ct-homeschooling/,WSHU's Molly Ingram and CT Mirror's Emilia Otte discuss her article about parents' pushpack against homeschooling regulation in Connecticut.,"How to keep track of the kids that are being homeschooled in Connecticut has been top of mind for advocates and lawmakers this year, following two highly publicized stories about neglect and abuse.
WSHU’s Molly Ingram spoke with CT Mirror’s Emilia Otte to discuss her article, “CT doesn’t regulate homeschooling. Many parents want to keep it that way,” as part of the collaborative podcast Long Story Short. Read Emilia’s story here.
WSHU: Hi, Emilia. Why has homeschooling been such a hot topic in Connecticut this year?
EO: It started out with an incident that became national news around a man in Waterbury who had been held captive essentially for two decades after he was withdrawn from public school. This incident raised a lot of attention, not only in the media, but in the state legislature, and it kicked off a conversation about the regulations, or really lack thereof, in Connecticut, and whether the state should do something to change that.
WSHU: That was one of two stories. There was also another really upsetting story out of New Britain about a little girl. What was the response to those situations from state oversight organizations like the Office of the Child Advocate?
EO: The Office of the Child Advocate really has been pushing for more regulation with regard to homeschooling. And this has not started just with the case in Waterbury. Back in 2017, the Office of the Child Advocate was also pushing for more homeschool regulation after a different case of a young man who was killed. And yeah, the Office of the Child Advocate really has been pushing to get some regulations into place around homeschooling.
WSHU: Can you talk about some of the recommendations that they made?
EO: Yes. So toward the end of the last legislative session in May, after the Waterbury incident had hit all of the national media, the Child Advocate started drawing up some recommendations. Those really included that the state would require homeschool parents to inform their local school districts each year that they’re homeschooling and that the children would receive some kind of academic evaluation every year. She also recommended that if a family was seeking to withdraw a child from homeschooling, the local school district should review the records of any family seeking to withdraw to see if there were any past reports of abuse or neglect, and then, if there was sufficient concern, inform DCF.
WSHU: And the response to those recommendations from the families that were homeschooling hasn’t been good. What do those look like?
EO: The homeschooling community has largely insisted that these cases, both the case of the Waterbury man and the girl who died, Jacqueline “Mimi” Torres-Garcia, the response has been that the homeschooling community has said that these cases have nothing to do with homeschooling. That they were cases of these young people being withdrawn from public school, that the public schools were well aware of concerns with these families, and that DCF really should have done more. That is their perspective.
WSHU: You mentioned in your story that it’s difficult to know how many people in Connecticut are being homeschooled, but that there definitely has been a jump. Can you talk a little bit about the numbers that we do know?
EO: Because Connecticut is one of the states that does not require homeschoolers to inform their local districts that they’re homeschooling, we don’t have an accurate count. Connecticut is certainly not alone in that. There are, I want to say, 12 states that don’t have any requirements for notifications. Most of the data that we do have, I was able to get from the Institute for Educational Policy at Johns Hopkins, and they got it from, I believe, census data. So we do know that there’s also state data that says that in 2023-24, just over 1800 children were reported as being homeschooled to SDE, the State Department of Education.
WSHU: So you spoke to some of these families that have come into homeschooling, many of them after the COVID-19 pandemic. Can you talk about some of their stories?
EO: Sure. So I went to a co-op in Stamford that formed after the pandemic had hit, and many of these families had withdrawn their children for a number of reasons; a lot of them, it was just like watching these children struggle with Zoom. And this Co-Op formed in, I want to say, after the 2021-22 school year ended, and basically they get together a couple of days a week, and the kids have these little classes that are taught by the parents based on the parents’ interest or the parents’ expertise. And it’s a really interesting place. I saw children learning carpentry. I saw children doing work with clay. Some kids were like, using tin foil and paper towel rolls and stuff to kind of create a play after reading the book, Bridge to Terabithia. But it was just a really vibrant place, and I think it’s a way of homeschooling that a lot of people don’t think about. We have these pictures of homeschooling as like sitting at your kitchen table doing math problems with your siblings, and that’s not what it always looks like.
It was an interesting experience for me because I didn’t know that much about homeschooling in general, but it was fascinating to hear these parents talk about both the struggles they’d had with their own school districts and the frustrations of the pandemic, but just how much they felt like they were part of a community, and they really loved being able to be part of this. So it was a learning experience for me, certainly.
WSHU: And the parents gave you an idea of what the benefits look like from their view. Can you talk a little bit about what they told you there?
EO: Yeah, sure. So for them, flexibility was a big thing, the ability to let their kids learn at their own pace and based on their interest level. I had one parent who said letting her sons learn at a pace where they didn’t have to feel like they were being compared to other students. I had several parents who I talked to whose children had some kind of learning disability and really struggled in the public schools, and they talked about just bringing the family closer together, having siblings learn side by side, being able to spend more time with their children, and they said that these were things they really valued.
WSHU: So, where do we stand now with the legislature? Legislation to deal with this didn’t pass this session. Do you think it’ll be brought back in 2026?
EO: I would anticipate that it would. Lawmakers who I spoke to did not say that there had been discussions going on, but stopped short of telling me whether there was any actual bill language or what specific policies had been discussed at this point.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025_1113_SR_Homeschool_280-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-15 15:56:57.208794

Dec. 15, 2025 | ScreenshotCarrying forward an effort that began in 2018, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel on Monday released the latest report in a series detailing her office’s investigations into the seven dioceses of Michigan’s Catholic Church. 
The latest report centers on the Grand Rapids Diocese, and examines allegations of sexual misconduct against children or adults brought after Jan. 1, 1950. 
Of the 51 priests in the report, 38 were incardinated by the Diocese of Grand Rapids. Thirty seven of the priests in the report are known and presumed to be dead, while the other 14 who are living are not in active ministry within the Grand Rapids Diocese.
“Since taking office in 2019 I’ve pledged to use the resources of my department to ensure that cases of sexual abuse and assault are thoroughly reviewed, and that, whenever we are able to do so, we pursue criminal charges and we do so relentlessly and aggressively,” Nessel told reporters on Monday. “Our additional promise to the many victims throughout the clergy abuse investigation was to make the results of the investigation transparent at its completion, and to that end, this is the fifth of seven reports that we’re releasing.”
Diocese of Grand Rapids Report Dec 12 2025
The Department of Attorney General’s previous reports focused on the diocese of  Marquette, Gaylord, Kalamazoo and Lansing. Danielle Hagaman-Clark, chief of the Department of Attorney General’s criminal justice bureau, said they expect to release the next report on the Diocese of Saginaw in spring 2026, and the report on the Detroit diocese will be released before the end of Nessel’s term in December 2026.
The Grand Rapids report compiles information obtained by the Department of Attorney General domestic violence, sexual assault and human trafficking hotline, victim interviews, police investigations, documents seized from the diocese alongside reports of allegations the diocese shared with the department. 
“The Diocese of Grand Rapids agreed to provide reports of abuse directly to the Department of Attorney General,” Nessel said. “Victims often reach out to their faith leaders to share stories of abuse and the willingness and cooperation from the Diocese of Grand Rapids to provide this information was instrumental in the compilation of this report.”
While the department’s investigations have led to criminal charges in 11 cases and criminal convictions in nine, none of the individuals named in the report have been charged as a result of the attorney general’s investigation, though Shauman Beas was previously convicted of child sexually abusive activity and criminal sexual conduct, and Dennis Wagner, was convicted of assault and battery.
Nessel and Hagaman-Clark explained that their decision not to bring additional criminal charges was due to a combination of factors, including the priest being deceased, or the statute of limitation to bring criminal charges expiring.

Prior to 2001, the statute of limitations for first degree criminal sexual conduct was six years from the date of the incident, or the victim’s 18th birthday. While that statute of limitations was eliminated, the Attorney General cannot bring charges against individuals when the statute of limitations has already expired, Hagaman-Clark explained. 
Hagaman-Clark noted that while some cases were within the statute of limitations, the survivors were not interested in moving forward with a criminal case. The Department of Attorney General also could not pursue criminal charges against Rev. Peter Omogo as they did not have the evidence needed to prove a crime beyond a reasonable doubt.
Nessel offered her thanks to the survivors who were willing to come forward and share their stories.
“We truly hope that this report provides a voice to those who have suffered in silence for so long, and shines a light on those alleged offenders whose actions allowed them to evade true accountability,” Nessel said.
In 25 years of working with sexual assault survivors, Hagaman-Clark said survivors often step forward into the criminal justice system to ensure that what happened to them does not happen to somebody else. 
“I think for some survivors, particularly those that were not able to move forward on a criminal case, to have the ability to be involved in a report where their offender is going to be named is really important to them and really significant to serve as a warning to those who still may have loyalties to those people,” Hagaman-Clark said, noting that these individuals are often dismissed due to authority an offender may hold.
Nessel and Hagaman-Clark advised anyone with information about abuse in the Catholic church to contact the department’s tip line at 844-324-3374, with Hagaman-Clark noting that they can help to connect survivors who may be struggling with local resources. 

“We start by believing,” Hagaman-Clark said. “And we want to listen, we want to hear, and we want to be able to take that information, and if we can move forward with the criminal case, then that is something that we’ve shown that we’re willing to do.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-15-at-11.06.10 AM-1024x571.png,,,2025-12-15 15:56:57.208794

(Left photo via GoFundMe; right photo via LinkedIn)The vice president of the College Republicans from Alabama and an aspiring neurosurgeon originally from Uzbekistan have been identified as the two Brown University students killed in Saturday’s mass shooting on campus.
Ella Cook, 19, a sophomore, was described by her local church as a “bright light” who was always engaged in her community. Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov, 18, a freshman, who graduated from high school in Virginia, is recalled by his family as “incredibly kind, funny, and smart.”
News of Cook’s death was shared during Sunday morning service at the Cathedral Church of the Advent in Birmingham, Alabama.
“Many of you heard about the tragedy, which happened at Brown University — and sadly, tragically, one of those people is one of our parishioners,” the Most Rev. Craig Smalley told parishioners in the service recorded on Facebook. 
Umurzokov’s death was confirmed in a statement issued by United States Ambassador to Uzbekistan Jonathan Henick. 
“We extend our sincere condolences to Mr. Umurzokov’s family, friends, and fellow students and mourn the loss of his bright future,” Henick wrote.
A GoFundMe account for Umurzokov’s family had raised more than $300,000 as of about 2:30 p.m. Monday. More than 6,800 people had donated. The family’s fundraiser has been verified by GoFundMe’s Trust & Safety team on its centralized hub for fundraisers related to the shooting.
Jack DiPrimio, a Brown graduate student studying public affairs, mentored Umurzokov as he adjusted to college life. In a message to Rhode Island Current, he said, “the world lost a treasure.”
“Please don’t think of him only as a victim,” DiPrimio said. “He was a passionate, intellectually-gifted, and curious individual. He was at ease talking to new people and he was very kind. He looked forward to hanging out with his friends after finals. He was passionate about science and politics, he was eager to change the world in some way.”
Online tributes to Cook and Umurzokov began to pour in Sunday, even as Providence police and Brown University have yet to officially confirm the identities of any of the 11 victims shot inside the Barus and Holley engineering building. Cook and Umurzokov were already dead when first responders arrived, and nine others were wounded. Eight students remain hospitalized at Rhode Island Hospital, including one still listed in critical condition.
The shooting happened in a classroom where a review was taking place for an economics final, university President Christina Paxson told reporters Sunday morning. The Providence Fire Department was first alerted about the shooting at 4:05 p.m.
Cook’s LinkedIn profile shows she worked as an ice cream server at a creamery in her hometown in the summer of 2024 and as a program assistant for Oxbridge Academic Programs in New York City from June through July of 2025.
Republican U.S Sen. Katie Britt of Alabama posted her condolences in a statement to X Monday.
“There are no words that can ease the pain Ella’s family and friends are enduring right now. Her life was taken too soon,” the statement said. “During this unimaginable time, I am deeply grateful to local, state and federal law enforcement officials who continue to work to ensure justice is served.”
Republican U.S. Sen. Tommy Tuberville of Alabama also extended his condolences on social media.
“I am heartbroken to hear that Mountain Brook’s Ella Cook was among those killed over the weekend at Brown University,” Tuberville said in the statement. “Our hearts and our prayers are with the Cook family and everyone impacted by this senseless killing.”
Cook served as the vice president of The Republican Club of Brown University. The organization did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
“Ella was known for her bold, brave, and kind heart as she served her chapter and her fellow classmates,” Martin Bertao, president of the College Republicans of America, posted to X Sunday night. “Our prayers are with her family, our Brown CR’s, and the entirety of the campus as they heal from this tragedy.”
Umurzokov’s family are naturalized U.S. citizens from Uzbekistan now living in a suburb of Richmond, Virginia, where his mother is a nurse and father owns a trucking company and drives long-haul, the Washington Post reported. One of his sisters told the Washington Post that he had a condition as a child that required brain surgery and his long recovery inspired him to become a brain surgeon.
Umurzokov graduated from Midlothian High School in Chesterfield, Virginia. Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger posted to X she was “heartbroken” to learn of Umurzokov’s loss. 
Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin said in a post to X Monday morning he was praying for all victims in the shooting.
“​​We lift up their families, friends and communities in a prayer of comfort and peace,” Youngkin said.
Umurzokov “had big dreams of becoming a neurosurgeon and helping people,” according to the GoFundMe account set up by his sister Samira.
“He always lent a helping hand to anyone in need without hesitation, and was the most kind-hearted person our family knew,” Samria Umurzokov wrote.

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — A nature preserve near Columbia could more than triple in size under a proposal that received initial approval from the state’s financial oversight committee.
An expansion of 480 acres at the Congaree Bluffs Heritage Preserve was one of several conservation projects the State Fiscal Accountability Authority signed off on pursuing last week. The OK from the board, which includes the governor and state treasurer, is typically among the first steps of a lengthy process involving land surveys and purchase negotiations.
Altogether, the approvals would add close to 10,000 acres to South Carolina’s protected lands.
Among those is about 480 acres the Department of Natural Resources is looking to add to the 201-acre Congaree Bluffs Heritage Preserve, which overlooks part of Congaree National Park in Calhoun County.
Located more than 100 feet above the 26,000-acre national park, the protected land is known for stunning views of the untouched swamp and bottomland forest. If the purchase goes through, the land would “add to the natural and cultural significance of the area by providing beautiful scenic hikes and views,” according to an agency application.
A family trust is offering the land for $2.5 million, according to the agency. Several other protected plots of land run alongside the portion the Department of Natural Resources is eyeing, including about 400 acres the Audubon Society owns.
Once at risk of development because of the sweeping vistas and proximity to Columbia, the area has been a top priority for conservation groups because it sits so near the state’s only national park, meaning any development could affect the park’s habitats.
The land contains a diverse mixture of trees, including at least 100 acres of loblolly pines the department could harvest and sell, as well as mixed hardwood pines, according to the agency request.
Heritage preserve and wildlife management areas
Jasper County’s Coosawhatchie Heritage Preserve could also see an expansion after approval from the board.
The Department of Natural Resources is looking to buy 635 acres that sit within land the agency already owns. For $1.8 million, that land could become part of the 10,570-acre preserve that opened to the public in September 2024.
A total of 1,265 acres will add to two of the state’s wildlife management areas, which offer deer, hog, quail hunting along with hiking trails. The board signed off on final land deals for the areas, allowing the department to move forward with the purchases.
That included 774 acres to establish the Bobwhite Hills Wildlife Management Area, located on the line between Lee and Sumter counties. The area is an important habitat for longleaf pines and sits beside a 2,500-acre unnamed wildlife management area, according to the application.
The agency will fund the $715,000 cost through proceeds from fees for hunting licenses.
Nearly 500 acres will protect land along nearly a mile of the Pee Dee River, which flows into the wetland Marsh Wildlife Management Area in Marion County. The existing 8,700-acre preserve sits in a floodplain, and preserving the riverfront will make sure the aquatic habitat stays protected, according to the application.
Conservation group buys 8,000-acre forest in Georgetown County

The state will pay just over $1 million for the property.
New state forest gets approval
One of three potential new state forests received initial approval from the committee, allowing state officials to survey the land and make sure it would make for a good addition to the five state-owned forests.
Nonprofit group The Conservation Fund plans to sell just over 8,000 acres in Georgetown County to the state for about $36.3 million. The Forestry Commission would turn that land into Carvers Bay State Forest, according to the application.
Primarily composed of pine trees, the forest is one of the most productive in the nation for timber harvesting, The Conservation Fund’s state director said previously. The state’s purchase will allow for continued harvesting of timber in a sustainable manner, protecting the trees from possible development.

A poinsettia garland twined around a staircase bannister, and a red and gold Christmas wreath adorned the facade. A grey and white cat mewed at the front door, asking to be let in. No one answered a knock at the door. 
Federal immigration enforcement detained the family that lived at the house in Harbor Pines Mobile Home Community — a mother, father, and at least two young children — on Dec. 4, a neighbor told Mississippi Today. 
A video circulated among neighbors that morning showed several people, including one wearing a law enforcement vest, approaching the home. The video, along with accounts of families detained by immigration enforcement shared on social media in the area, has kindled fear among some members of the community. 
Rick McKay, who has lived in Harbor Pines for about 20 years, said he wasn’t aware of the arrests but that the neighborhood has been quiet lately, possibly due to a fear of intensified immigration enforcement. 
“It might be a little quiet, but it’s winter,” he said. 
Fear and uncertainty are spreading through immigrant communities across Mississippi as reports emerge of immigration agents detaining individuals and families. Although this month’s arrests have been more sporadic than those in nearby Louisiana — where federal agents launched the latest immigration crackdown Dec. 3 — their effects have swiftly rippled throughout Mississippi.
The number of people detained in Mississippi is unknown publicly. Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not respond to Mississippi Today’s request for comment Friday. And, it’s unclear how or if the recent arrests made in Mississippi are connected to the operation based in New Orleans, dubbed “Catahoula Crunch.” 
Tracking arrests of people swept up by federal immigration agents has proven difficult for advocates and families because the agencies directing the crackdown have offered little information about the operation. Nor have local and state law enforcement, even though some have agreements to cooperate with ICE.
Catahoula Crunch, also referred to as Operation Swamp Sweep in planning documents, is the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s third major immigration enforcement action this year, following Midway Blitz in Chicago and November’s Charlotte’s Web in Charlotte, North Carolina. Early reports showed the campaign aimed to arrest roughly 5,000 people across Louisiana and southeastern Mississippi.
Federal agents have made more than 250 arrests across southeast Louisiana this month, according to The Associated Press. 
DHS said the sweep in New Orleans continues its efforts to arrest “rapists, thieves, gang members, human smugglers, and abusers,” though an AP report identified criminal histories for less than a third of the 38 people arrested in the operation’s first two days. 
Some Mississippi leaders, including Republican Gov. Tate Reeves, have embraced the operation, while immigrant communities and advocates said they are bracing themselves.
“We support the president’s efforts in trying to get law and order in our state and in our country,” Reeves said to WAPT Nov. 21.
Lea Campbell, an Ocean Springs resident and member of the Mississippi Gulf Coast Mutual Aid Collective, said the community advocacy group has seen an increased presence of federal immigration officers on the Coast.
“We kind of are preparing for the worst,” Campell said.
‘Something better for their daughters’
Debbie Pierce is one of five women who founded Adelante, a Jackson-based group that provides support to the immigrant community. In recent weeks, she said members have learned that several people they were assisting were detained by ICE, leaving behind empty cars. 
The group is also supporting a Brandon woman caring for three children younger than 3 after immigration agents arrested their mother at the end of November while she was on her way to work. ICE records show the woman, Ana Lucas-Pedro, is detained at the Richwood Correctional Center in Monroe, Louisiana. 
Kitzia, an Adelante member who asked to be identified by her first name, said she has taken donations of food and diapers to the neighbor and children. 
“I don’t think she was prepared in any way, shape or form,” Kitzia said of the mother. She said the same of the stand-in caretaker, who is now burdened with caring for three children in addition to her own.

In Ridgeland, a neighbor who asked to remain anonymous for fear of being targeted by law enforcement, identified one person arrested at Harbor Pines Mobile Home Park as Rolando Quintero de la Cruz. ICE records show he was born in Mexico and is being held at the LaSalle Detention Facility in Jena, Louisiana. 
His wife, Jennifer Luis-Hernandez is being held at the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, Texas, according to ICE records. Mississippi Today was not able to locate the children, and immigration detention records are not available for minors.  
ICE did not respond to questions about how many people, or if any children, were detained in the arrest. 
The South Texas Family Residential Center was built in 2014 to house families, but President Joe Biden’s administration halted the practice of family detention and the facility held only adults until it closed in 2024. It reopened in March, retrofitted to house children again. 
The family moved to the U.S. a few years ago to improve their quality of life and “look for something better for their daughters,” Maricruz Nostroza Dionisio, a family friend, said in Spanish in a message to Mississippi Today. 
Alex Gilbert, a spokesperson for the Mississippi Department of Child Protection Services, said the process for bringing any child, regardless of immigration status, into state custody remains the same. 
Concern for a child’s safety would need to first be reported to a statewide hotline, which would lead the department to conduct an investigation, she said in a Friday statement. From there, the agency can make recommendations for the youth court, and a judge can issue a custody order. 
How sightings affect community
Immigration agents in unmarked vehicles and vests have been spotted from the Jackson metro area to the Coast, community advocates say. 
Campbell said people have seen an uptick of Customs and Border Protection vans and trucks, especially by exits along Interstate 10, and in downtown Biloxi and Gulfport. 
Pierce, of Adelente, said agents have been seen in Canton, Madison and Pelahatchie in Madison and Rankin counties in central Mississippi. 
Jeremy Litton, an immigration attorney, said ICE or CBP agents continue to be seen in Forest, which is an hour east of Jackson, weeks after two back-to-back sightings of officers near businesses that serve the Latino community.  
The increased presence of federal immigration officials, paired with news of detainments, has led to some immigrants staying home and not attending school or church, advocates said. 
Michael Oropeza, executive director of El Pueblo, a nonprofit serving low-income immigrant communities in Mississippi, said the organization cancelled its annual Hispanic festival fundraiser and stopped holding in-person education events out of fear for the community. 
News of immigration raids ripples beyond the place where enforcement activity occurs, she said.  
“When there’s a raid in one town, fear is going to spread to others in real time,” Oropeza said. 
Advocates respond with aid, information
Advocates and community groups say they are helping immigrants in a variety of ways: bringing groceries to them so they don’t have to go to the store, offering assistance with transportation and connecting them to legal services. 
Pierce, of Adelante, is helping to tutor the children of immigrants in the Jackson area. She hopes the church they are using can continue to be a safe space for them. 
Campbell said volunteers for the Mississippi Gulf Coast Mutual Aid Collective take students home from a Biloxi afterschool program, so parents do not have to risk contact with immigration agents. 
The Gulf Coast group also collects information about the presence of immigration agents in public spaces and shares the reports through social media.
Community groups are also offering resources and education for the greater community, such as “know your rights” training. 
The presence of federal immigration officers in Mississippi creates a climate of fear that undermines immigrants’ sense of safety, even among those not directly being targeted, Oropeza said. 
“It just breaks down institutional trust with schools and hospitals and even local law enforcement, which is scary,” she said.

The organization, which launched in 2007, first warned in November it was at risk of halting live coverage as well as pulling its video archive of more than 30,000 hours of state government proceedings, candidate interviews and other programming offline. 
“Due to extreme competition and a complete collapse in private funding — marked by donor fatigue, competing nonprofit campaigns, record-breaking political fundraising and economic uncertainty — WisconsinEye’s website is unavailable,” a message on the WisEye website states. “Without consistent annual funding…. citizens, legislators, legislative staff, the governor’s administration, agency leadership and staff, trade associations, attorneys and the courts, local government officials, journalists and all print, cable, television and radio news outlets, businesses, nonprofit organizations — all lose the only reliable and proven source of unfiltered State Capitol news and state government proceedings.”
Jon Henkes, the president of WisconsinEye, told the Examiner last month that, similar to other nonprofits, the organization has faced a tough fundraising environment since the COVID-19 pandemic. He said then that the organization has made “well qualified, well cultivated” donation requests totaling more than $9 million with none of those requests leading to donations.
Henkes said that the organization was still making donor inquiries and that raising at least $250,000 could get the organization through the first quarter of 2026. 
WisconsinEye has also turned its attention to the state Legislature for help, sending a letter to lawmakers in November asking them to make state funds available for its operational costs. 
The Wisconsin Legislature and Gov. Tony Evers set aside $10 million in matching funds in the 2023-25 state budget to help WisconsinEye build a permanent endowment. After the organization failed to raise sufficient funds to access that money, the current state budget changed provisions so that $250,000 of the $10 million was available with no match, which helped cover expenses through Dec. 15. The rest of the funding was made to be available on a dollar-by-dollar match basis, meaning as WisconsinEye raises its own funds it would be able to get an equivalent amount of state funds. The opportunity for the organization to access the funds expires in June 2026.
The organization is asking for the state to modify the match requirement and make funds available.
“We’re simply asking for release of those funds, or part of those funds, in a way different from the endowment,” Henkes told the Examiner in November. “The best case scenario would be if the Legislature would release a minimum of one year, so $1 million, essentially to carry us forward, and we can focus 100% over the next several months through June, to really hammer down and see if we can’t raise some endowment dollars. We think that’s a very viable option, and we’re hopeful.”

In the course of my 32-year law enforcement career, I came to understand community safety as the reason law enforcement work truly matters.
That may seem obvious, but at this moment, it’s worth looking at why it’s so important — and what community safety really means.
I became a police officer thinking I knew what the job was. I learned quickly that it was much different from what I expected.
Early in my career, I had the opportunity to work as an investigator. I had two years on the job. I thought I was going to be investigating the kind of cases you see immortalized in movies. Instead, I was given the sexual assault and domestic violence caseload.
I was 25, and I lacked the prerequisite empathy, training, and life experience to understand the complexities of such crimes. I really did not want to do that work. I asked my boss, “Why me?” The response from my boss was simple: “If not you, who?”
Most sex abuse cases involve children and women. My first case involved a little girl around 8 years old. I still remember how I walked into a cold and sterile interview room and introduced myself to the child and the adult accompanying her.
After my introduction, the child walked toward me and embraced me. She would not let go. I can still feel the fear and anxiety in her embrace. She was sobbing. I knew at that moment that I needed to grow up fast.
Working with victims of abuse and violence opened my eyes to the many inequities that exist in society and within our system of justice. I met so many people who lacked support and voice. Victims are vulnerable and police officers should protect them.
Protecting victims, and the community, is the essence of community safety. Later in my career, I came to realize that fulfilling that obligation requires protecting everyone — regardless of their legal status.
This is why I am concerned to see reports that some victims of crime are being deported despite having a pending U Visa, which offers legal protection to crime victims here without authorization.
Building trust while acknowledging vulnerability within the community has never been easy. The last 13 years of my career, I proudly served as Marshalltown’s chief of police. This city is the only place in my adult life that has felt like home, and it has everything to do with the other people who also call it home. Marshalltown is a wonderfully diverse community.
Serving as a law enforcement officer in a racially and culturally diverse community opens your heart and your mind to the inequity and the challenges your neighbors face while navigating deepening political division. Lately, even against a backdrop of misleading rhetoric about minority and immigrant communities, I have seen Marshalltown show what kindness and community look like.
But that doesn’t happen overnight. It’s built over the years, and an officer in the field needs the tools to earn that trust.
Early in my tenure as police chief in Marshalltown, I had a community meeting with a delegation from the local Latino community. Going into this meeting, I was concerned about what might happen. At the time, the police department did not have a good relationship with the community, in general.
We lacked trust. I was certain this meeting would be negative.
I learned quickly how wrong I was. What did people want? They wanted to be heard. They wanted a partner. They wanted to help build a safer community with law enforcement.
With foreign neighbors, there are basic things an officer can offer. One is the possibility of collaborating with us without fear of being deported. U visas have been a tool to guarantee that collaboration.
Official data shows that nearly half a million immigrants are still awaiting decisions on U visa applications. Legislative proposals such as the Immigrant Witness and Victim Protection Act —recently reintroduced by Rep. Jimmy Panetta, D-California, — aim to reduce these backlogs and protect immigrant victims and witnesses.
When our immigrant neighbors feel confident in their local police, officers can fulfill their mission to protect everyone — and together, we create a safer community for all. On the other hand, having local police collaborating with federal immigration authorities and deporting foreign victims who had the courage to speak up only hurts us all.
Talking about this topic is easier for me as a retired chief of police. I recognize that immigration reform and advocacy have never been more challenging than they are today.
The current political climate is harsh and confrontational, placing police officers in a difficult position. Yet, with the support of their communities, they must persevere in protecting all residents.
Keeping everyone safe means not having anyone stay silent when they are a victim who needs us to stand with them.
I ask all of us — but especially my fellow law enforcement officers, especially in Iowa, to remember that our work matters. You are making a difference. And I ask what my first boss asked me: “If not us, who?”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2230182667.jpg,,,2025-12-15 14:57:36.173634

Here in North Carolina, around one in seven people — including a quarter of our children — are burdened by food insecurity.
And just to make the situation that much more outrageous and inexcusable, recent actions by federal and state elected officials to undermine SNAP food assistance and slash funding for anti-hunger nonprofits have made the situation significantly worse. The result: this year, more people than ever are struggling to feed their families. Amazingly, however, the good people doing anti-hunger work remain resilient and unbowed, and recently we got the chance to learn more about the needs in our community and how average folks can help in an extended conversation with the president and CEO of the Interfaith Food Shuttle, Ron Pringle.
In Part One of our recent extended conversation with Interfaith Food Shuttle President and CEO Ron Pringle, we dug into the hunger crisis that currently afflicts North Carolina and how recent actions by federal and state lawmakers to slash funding for food assistance and nonprofits that aid people in need have made an already bad situation significantly worse.
In Part Two of our chat, we dug deeper into the details of the current hunger crisis, some of the many innovative and hopeful ways in which groups like the Food Shuttle, even with depleted funding, seek to attack it, and how average North Carolinians can support their effort by donating their time, talents and treasure.

It’s now been nearly 15 months since the worst storm in modern times to hit western North Carolina – Hurricane-turned-Tropical Storm Helene – inundated numerous mountain communities, killed more than 100 people and inflicted tens of billions of dollars in property damage.
Unfortunately, as NC Newsline has reported on numerous occasions, especially when it comes to the federal government, the response has been decidedly and often maddeningly inadequate. Despite repeated pleas from Gov. Josh Stein, funding from Washington has been slow and spotty and, thanks to Trump administration bloodletting, federal agencies that should be helping to spearhead the recovery have been inadequately staffed and often missing in action. As a result, western North Carolina residents remain deeply frustrated and worried about the future and recently we caught up with a storm survivor and local recovery leader who’s traveling to the nation’s capital along with a group of other disaster survivors from around the country this week to call for a better federal response – Watauga County carpenter and organizer Jon Council.

Brian Stack, would increase punishment for crimes connected to political violence or harassment of public officials. (Hal Brown for New Jersey Monitor)A Senate panel in unanimous votes Monday approved bills that would heighten penalties for harassment against public officials and certain politically driven crimes.
The legislation advanced by the Senate Judiciary Committee comes as public officials in New Jersey and nationwide say they are increasingly becoming targets for harassment and violence. Sen. Troy Singleton (D-Burlington) tried to deflate criticism that one of the bills would limit criticism of elected officials.
“If an individual, as we said before, goes to any public meeting like this one and says, ‘You know what, I don’t like the way Troy Singleton voted on this bill or that bill. I think Troy Singleton is corrupt,'” Singleton said. “Though that would hurt my feelings, under this bill … it would not stop that person of being critical of any action that I’m taking.”
Lawmakers propose tax breaks to save New Jersey diners

That bill, sponsored by Sen. Brian Stack (D-Hudson), the Senate judiciary chairman, would upgrade penalties for cyber harassment against public servants, including, among others, elected officials, jurors, and judges.
Cyber harassment aimed at a public servant could earn jail sentences of between one and five years under the bill. The state’s existing harassment law caps sentences at 18 months.
The bill would also create a new office tasked with assisting victims and creating new roadblocks for harassment aimed at public servants. Among other things, that office would be tasked with collaborating with social media platforms to develop stricter policies on the identification and removal of harassing posts.
The bipartisan legislation faced little opposition. Leonard Filipkowski, who operates on YouTube under the name Leroy Truth, was critical of the bill. 
“Senate bill 3470 expands cyber harassment law in a way that allows investigative reporting about public officials to be reframed as a serious criminal offense carrying state prison exposure based not on violence or threats but on who my speech and my reporting is about,” Filipkowski said. “That is not public safety. That is power protecting itself.”
Filipkowski is a longtime Stack opponent and has accused the senator, who is Union City’s mayor, of corruption. Stack, who has denied any wrongdoing, and other Union City officials have accused Filipkowski of harassment, which Filipkowski denies.
The bill makes no changes to the elements that define cyber harassment under state law.
To be found guilty of cyber harassment, a person must have threatened physical harm to another or their property, threatened to commit a crime against them, or posted or requested obscene material about a person with the intent to cause them emotional harm or fear.
It will need to clear a vote before the Senate Budget Committee before heading to the chamber’s floor. An Assembly companion has not advanced through committees in the lower chamber.
A separate bipartisan bill sponsored by Stack and Sen. Doug Steinhardt (R-Warren) would create a new political violence charge that prosecutors could add to indictments against individuals who commit serious crimes like murder, kidnapping, or sexual assault, among others, based on a victim’s political beliefs.
The construction of the political violence charge mirrors that of the state’s bias intimidation offenses, which is what New Jersey calls hate crimes.
Under both, the severity of penalties keys off the severity of the underlying offense. If someone, for example, commits a robbery in which no one is injured or killed, they face five to 10 years in prison. But if that robbery was targeted based on the victim’s political beliefs, the perpetrator could also face a first-degree political violence charge, which would carry penalties of up to 20 years’ imprisonment.
A companion bill has not been introduced in the Assembly.

In a social media post, the incumbent Republican from Holland Township said he planned to seek another term, noting his work to make “Southwest Michigan an even better place” was not complete, while touting his accomplishments since winning the seat in 2010.
“To combat record inflation and improve affordability, I’ve secured historic-new-tax cuts and ensured Michiganders across all walks of life keep more of their hard-earned money,” Huizenga stated in the post. “I also voted to lower energy prices while championing transformative energy investments here in Southwest Michigan. My record shows I’ve always stood up for our men and women in law enforcement and uniform while never backing down in the fight to restore control of our borders.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Huizenga had been mentioned as a possible contender for the GOP nomination in the 2026 U.S. Senate race, after incumbent  Gary Peters (D-Bloomfield Township) announced his retirement. And while Huizenga ended that speculation in July, essentially ceding the nomination to former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers (R-White Lake), until Monday his future intentions remained speculative.
State Sen. Sean McCann (D-Kalamazoo) is the leading contender for the Democratic nomination, having recently secured the endorsement of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. Also in the running is Kalamazoo attorney Jessica Swartz, IT and cybersecurity professional Richard Aaron and former Congressional staffer Diop Harris.
The 4th U.S. House District includes all of Allegan and Van Buren counties, as well as portions of Ottawa, Kalamazoo, Calhoun, and Berrien counties.

The Des Moines private university stated in a news release it is developing a “DU Korea” study abroad program in Seoul, South Korea, to join existing DU programs housed in Spain and England.
Created in partnership with education travel company WorldStrides and Konkuk University, the program will begin welcoming students to Seoul in spring 2027. According to the release, a cohort model is used in each program where Drake students enroll in a common course taught by Drake faculty and fill the rest of their schedule with courses from the partner university.

“The cohort model embodies Drake’s mission to build a global perspective, and we’re thrilled to bring this successful approach to Seoul,” said Annique Kiel, Drake University chief global affairs officer and dean of global programs, in the release.
Students of all majors are welcome to join the new study abroad program, the release stated, and its first cohort will enroll between 10-20 students. Drake University Associate Dean of Student Affairs Kelley Ellis, also an associate professor of practice in accounting, will lead the cohort and teach a course called “Business for Good” for both Drake and Konkuk University students.
Outside of coursework, the release stated students will take trips to Busan and Tokyo and will have the chance to “incorporate a custom internship” into their semester studying abroad.

(Photo courtesy of the West Virginia Division of Motor Vehicles)With a deadline approaching in February, the West Virginia Division of Motor Vehicles is reminding those who have not already gotten their REAL ID to do so or pay a fee when flying in 2026.
The Real ID Act of 2005 established minimum security standards for state-issued driver’s licenses and identification cards that can be used for official federal purposes. Beginning May 7, 2025, the IDs were required to fly domestically and enter certain federal facilities. 
The federal Transportation Security Administration announced earlier this month it will offer an option of an extra identity check and a $45 fee beginning Feb. 1 for all airport passengers who do not have a REAL ID or another acceptable ID, such as a passport. 
As of Monday, more than 63% state residents have a REAL ID, signified by a gold star in the corner of their licenses, the state DMV said in a news release. 
The rest of state residents can easily get one, the DMV said. 
“The first time you get the REAL ID, you bring in your birth certificate and your name change documents,” Mike May, manager of the REAL ID program for the West Virginia DMV, said in a news release. “After that, it’s the same as a regular renewal every time.” 
To get a REAL ID, residents must go to the DMV in person and pay a $10 renewal fee. They can go online to Real ID Headstart to upload necessary identity and residency records and make an appointment to get their REAL ID.
“Life happens,” state DMV Commissioner Everett Frazier said in the release. “Even for someone who has never flown, you don’t know when you might have to. Don’t let procrastination become your frustration. We’re here to help.”

(Getty Images)Indiana health officials are extending open enrollment for two major Medicaid programs through Dec. 24, giving more time for hundreds of thousands of Hoosiers facing a forced plan change to select another option from the state’s managed care lineup.
The Family and Social Services Administration announced Thursday that the Healthy Indiana Plan, or HIP, which serves low-income adults, and PathWays for Aging, the Medicaid program for older adults and people with disabilities, will remain open for plan selection an additional week. The deadline was originally set for mid-December.
FSSA said the deadline extension is in response to ongoing “high engagement” from members seeking assistance with coverage decisions and comes ahead of the state’s phaseout of MDwise as one of Indiana’s Medicaid managed care options. The move is expected to affect about 300,000 Hoosiers.


FSSA encouraged all members enrolled in HIP or PathWays to use the extended timeframe to review their options and contact the enrollment broker for help, with HIP assistance at 1-877-GET-HIP9 (1-877-438-4479) and PathWays at 1-877-284-9294.


In November, the agency announced that MDwise will no longer serve as a managed care health plan for Indiana’s Medicaid programs, including HIP and Hoosier Healthwise, effective Jan. 1. Members currently covered by MDwise must select a new plan from the remaining carriers — Anthem, CareSource or Managed Health Services — during the current open enrollment.
MDwise was a provider for HIP but not Pathways.
The providers under Pathways are Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Humana Healthy Horizons and UnitedHealthcare Community Plan of Indiana.
Hoosiers currently enrolled in HIP or Pathways for Aging who do not select a plan by the new Dec. 24 deadline will be automatically enrolled in a plan “that closely matches their current coverage.”
For those transitioning from the MDwise health plan, FSSA is offering added flexibility — those members will have a 90-day window after open enrollment ends to switch plans if they are not satisfied with the one they are auto-assigned, according to the agency.
FSSA Secretary Mitch Roob previously said a review found MDwise “was both the most expensive and the lowest in quality,” and that ending its participation would help the state meet federal requirements while “safeguarding members’ access to care.”
The MDwise exit is part of broader efforts by Gov. Mike Braun’s administration to rein in fast-growing Medicaid costs and improve quality across the program.
MDwise has challenged the state’s decision in court, arguing that the termination will disrupt care and harm its longstanding business in Indiana. A judge denied a request for a temporary restraining order, allowing the state’s actions to proceed.

Researchers found that brown anoles get more aggressive as the temperature rises. (Louisiana Illuminator photo)Researchers have learned something new about the lizards taking over New Orleans landscapes. In addition to thriving despite ultra-high levels of lead in their blood, it turns out they can get pretty mean when the temperature rises.  
A study from Tulane University on brown anole lizards found these invasive reptiles are more aggressive toward native green anoles when it gets hotter. 
The study adds to a growing body of evidence that warming temperatures could lead brown anoles to out-compete their scaly green cousins in the wild. 
The latest research springboards off of work earlier this year that documented high levels of lead in the blood of New Orleans brown anoles.
Alex Gunderson, Tulane assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, is lead author of the new study published in the Journal of Thermal Biology. His team originally set out to determine whether the lead levels made brown anoles more aggressive. Evidence gathered so far suggests heat, rather than lead, has more to do with their feisty attitudes.
“Since we haven’t seen lead affecting them in other ways, my guess is that it’s probably not the cause. What we can say for certain is that their aggression increases with warmer temperatures,” Gunderson said in a Tulane news release. 
To test the anoles’ angry behavior, Gunderson and doctoral student Julie Rej put pairs of green and brown anoles together in different enclosures. Each space was set at a different temperature to mimic different seasons, from the comfortable days of spring to the intense heat of a South Louisiana summer. 
Brown anoles picked more fights than the greens in all different temperatures. But while green anoles became slightly more combative as temperatures rose, brown anoles became much more hostile as researchers turned up the heat. 
Gunderson said the study suggests, as the rising temperatures associated with climate change intensifies, brown anoles could spread even further into the green anoles’ habitats. 
“Climate change can make invasive species more potent, and this study shows that heat-driven aggression could help explain why in some cases,” Gunderson said.
Understanding how rising temperatures affects the spread of invasive species like the brown anole could help inform management strategies into the future, Rej said. 
“Invasive species cause a lot of ecological and economic damage, so biologists are really interested in understanding what makes these species so successful,” she said.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/lead-lizard-1024x820.jpg,,,2025-12-15 13:56:49.920838

May 1, 2023. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska News Service)LINCOLN — Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers formally launched his 2026 reelection campaign Monday, vowing to continue to fight for Nebraskans and the state’s conservative values.
Hilgers, in an interview with the Nebraska Examiner, said his team has sought to make good use of every day since taking office in 2023. 
He said that includes infusing a business background into his office’s “DNA” and working to fight “otherwise unaccountable powerful interests who are taking advantage of or otherwise harming Nebraskans.”
“It is an honor every day to wake up to be the attorney general, to be able to take on these fights,” Hilgers told the Examiner. “They matter so much, and I’m just beyond grateful that Nebraskans trusted me in this particular role.”

Under his leadership, Hilgers said his office has a mission to be the most tenacious, energetic, entrepreneurial and conservative AG’s office in the country. Hilgers now serves as vice chair of the Republican Attorneys General Association.
He noted his entire team could probably fit on one floor of the Texas Attorney General’s Office, yet Nebraska is leading some of the “most important [legal] fights in the country.” His office has pursued legal battles against Google, Facebook/Meta, TikTok, the Biden administration, China-based Temu and Lorex, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, California, Colorado, a Swiss billionaire, General Motors, Change Healthcare and more.
“That just means that, pound for pound, Nebraskans [get] the most that they possibly can out of the Nebraska Attorney General’s Office,” Hilgers said.
Some critics, primarily Democratic state lawmakers, have accused Hilgers of waging political wars that “waste” taxpayer dollars, which Hilgers denies.
So far, Hilgers, a Republican, is running unopposed for the May 12 primary election. No Democratic candidate has announced a campaign. The deadline for non-elected officials to file to run for office is March 2. The attorney general has an annual salary of $95,000.
‘Every penny worth of value’
Hilgers described his approach to being Nebraska’s AG as, more than anything, trying to “really conserve our democratic republic” and seeking to uphold what he sees as the limited government framework of the U.S. Constitution and freedoms of the U.S. Bill of Rights and the Nebraska Constitution.

He described himself as a textualist legal scholar, a contrast to some legal minds who view laws as up for interpretation or the Constitution as a “living” document. Hilgers previously served six years as a state senator before becoming attorney general, including two years as speaker of the Legislature.
The AG’s Office portion of state general funds — primarily from sales and income taxes — has increased from $7.4 million in January 2023 to $8.9 million this budget year, through June 30. Part of the increase accounted for increases to staff salaries and benefits.
Hilgers said the expansion also accounts for a heightened solicitor general team. He described them as “Navy SEAL, glass-eating” lawyers who fight some of the state’s most complex and highest-profile cases. He’s also added an additional criminal prosecutor and investigators for a full-time Ogallala office and a liaison for missing, murdered and indigenous persons. He said the Ogallala office, including a prosecutor with more than 20 years experience, is believed to be the first full-time AG’s Office west of Lincoln.
“Taxpayers of Nebraska are getting every penny worth of value out of the team that they’re putting on the field, that we’re taking on some of the biggest fights,” Hilgers said.
Responding to critics
Ten state senators, nine of them Democrats and one a progressive registered nonpartisan, recently blasted his decision to sue the Omaha Public Power District for plans to cease coal production in Omaha, in which his office cited energy affordability and reliability concerns.
State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln, who some Democrats had tried to recruit to run against Hilgers, before she announced a reelection bid, didn’t join that letter but has frequently butted heads with Hilgers.

She requested a budget breakdown from Hilgers’ office in April for pursuing an “aggressive politically charged litigation agenda and within your sole discretion.”
Hilgers said if Nebraskans looked at his office’s full work, they would see a web of cases he described as deeply aligned with their interests. 
He also highlighted the work of consumer protection, checking state health professionals’ conduct, fighting human trafficking and supporting prosecutors who have fewer resources, such as in murder trials or complex child sexual assault cases. 
Working with the Legislature this year, his office secured laws to curb cellphone use in K-12 classrooms, require age verification for future social media accounts and require additional guardrails in social media algorithms.
“Nebraskans are fair-minded,” Hilgers said. “They’re not partisan.”
High-profile state, national cases
Hilgers’ team has been no stranger to high-profile cases, including legal victories against the Biden administration around electric vehicles and emissions standards, as well as Biden’s student loan forgiveness attempts that led Nebraska lawyers to the U.S. Supreme Court.

Hilgers credited the Nebraska Legislature for funding his office at a level where it could take on the U.S. Department of Justice, and win.
Nebraska also led the fight under Hilgers to block new electric truck standards from California and Washington, D.C., which Hilgers said would have likely impacted all Nebraskans. His efforts earned direct praise from the chair of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission in August.
Delta-8, hemp and cannabis
Under Hilgers’ leadership, his office has also taken on delta-8, intoxicating hemp and other “synthetic” cannabinoids or products containing tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). The crackdown has included sending more than 300 cease and desist letters to shops in the state.
That litigation-focused campaign has continued as state legislative efforts stall to close a “loophole” around the THC products. Hilgers maintains that the products were always illegal.
But the battlefield shifted when Congress, on Nov. 12, the same night congressional lawmakers ended the longest government shutdown ever, voted to explicitly make the products illegal in one year. Barring any legal action or additional changes, Hilgers’ war reached a new front.
“We were kind of in the midst of that battle. We still are in a way, but I think everyone is assessing what is happening after the federal government’s decision,” Hilgers said.
He continued: “I think it was a very significant win for the country. … That federal provision, we think, will end the battle.”

On Dec. 3, Hilgers’ team argued before the Nebraska Supreme Court that a district court judge incorrectly upheld the legality of 2024 medical cannabis petitions. The public vote on the ballot measures that came from those petitions ushered in state laws legalizing up to 5 ounces of medical marijuana with a health care practitioner’s recommendation and created a new state regulatory commission. Hilgers’ office has alleged fraud in petition signature gathering. The trial judge found some questionable signatures but rejected the notion of widespread wrongdoing. The campaign has denied the allegations.
Hilgers has been at the center of that opposition, and he noted that while 71% of Nebraskans approved of legalizing medical cannabis, 100% of Nebraskans are bound by state law. 
“I think 100% of Nebraskans should care that the rules underlying our petition process are followed,” Hilgers said.
He has said it is an “abject failure” of the federal government not to uphold the laws Congress created. Under existing federal guidelines, marijuana is defined as having no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse. Hilgers noted his office has not sought to temporarily block the medical cannabis laws in court and that his team is working with the Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission, which he said is following the law as set by voters.
In March, a representative of the AG’s Office told a legislative committee the state would sue the commission if and when it issued its first licenses, which came in October. No lawsuit has been filed.
The state commission will soon need to finalize regulations for the medicine supply chain, which would need Hilgers’ approval. Hilgers said he doesn’t want to “prejudge” the process or say, precisely, what his office would do. 
Outside dynamics, including whether President Donald Trump might downgrade marijuana to a lower class of drugs, could also change the game.
“I would just tell you that we are working hard to support the Cannabis Commission with regulations that potentially could avoid litigation,” Hilgers said.
‘Do the right thing’
Hilgers and U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., a former governor who also opposes marijuana, had urged the Legislature in 2025 not to act to clarify the state’s regulatory framework on medical cannabis. Hilgers said if there are small tweaks, his office would “of course” take a look, but he hopes for legal clarity soon.

Medical cannabis supporters have pointed their frustrations at Hilgers, Ricketts and Gov. Jim Pillen for what they say are efforts to impede the “will of the people.” Hilgers has recognized that anger, argued it’s his duty to step up and said he is a “big boy” and that critics of his decisions don’t bother him.
“I could not go to my grave looking backward at the work that I did, whether it’s in the Legislature or here, and having that kind of a consideration for me not to do the right thing,” Hilgers said in May, when he confirmed he would seek reelection.
Last year, Nebraska Secretary of State Bob Evnen was sued over Hilgers’ legal interpretation of the separation of powers around legislative bills to restore voting rights to felons after the completion of their sentences. 
Hilgers argued that was a power of the Board of Pardons, a group he serves on with Evnen and Pillen.
The Nebraska Supreme Court ultimately ordered Evnen to comply with the law, which he did. Hilgers said that’s part of the legal process, though he maintains the Supreme Court narrowly ruled in the case and didn’t address the constitutional questions his office raised about the underlying laws. At least five of seven justices must agree to strike down a law as unconstitutional. At least two, in dissents, said they would have. 
Future priorities
Hilgers said he would continue to uphold election integrity and that anyone who is thinking of cheating in a Nebraska election should think twice, “because we’re going to go after them.” Hilgers also defended a federal request of Nebraska’s voter rolls, the subject of a separate lawsuit.

Hilgers’ 2026 focus is continuing the “big fights” his office has picked already, including against companies represented by lawyers he said bill at least a thousand dollars per hour. Next year, Hilgers plans to deploy his team to continue to push back against “otherwise unaccountable powerful interests” in what will also be a “light” legislative policy year for him in a session likely be dominated by the state budget.
Hilgers, describing himself, said he tries every day to bring the best of Nebraska values to the job, such as hard work, grit, energy, tenacity, courage, humbleness, modesty and a “smile on our face.” 
He said his team tries to listen to people, especially those who disagree, and doesn’t let cynicism or negativity in the political environment affect work.
“We just go to work every day,” Hilgers said, “enormously grateful for the honor to serve Nebraskans.”

Ella Cook was a sophomore at Brown. Cathedral Church of the Advent in Birmingham, an Episcopalian church which Cook attended, announced during service on Sunday that Cook was one of the victims.
“Those of you who knew her, those of you that know her, she was an incredible grounded, faithful, bright light,” the Very Rev. R. Craig Smalley said.
A message seeking comment was left with the church on Monday. 
Cook was the vice president of the Brown University College Republicans. The organization posted a statement on social media Sunday saying Cook was known for her “bold, brave, kind heart.”
Nine people were wounded in the attack. The Rhode Island Current reported that eight students remained hospitalized as of Sunday evening. As of Monday morning, Brown University had not publicly identified the victims of the shooting. 
The attack took place in an engineering and physics building on campus. As of Monday morning, police had not made an arrest in connection with the shooting. Police had yet to charge a person with the crime. 
“We know this is a source of tremendous fear and anxiety across our community right now. While [Department of Public Safety] DPS was at one point informed that there was an individual in custody, that person was determined not to be the shooting suspect after questioning,” the statement said. “Therefore, we urge all members of our community to remain vigilant. We continue to be in lockdown, and it is imperative that all members of our community remain sheltered in place.”
U.S Sen. Katie Britt, R-Alabama, posted her condolences in a statement to X Monday.
“There are no words that can ease the pain Ella’s family and friends are enduring right now. Her life was taken too soon,” the statement said. “During this unimaginable time, I am deeply grateful to local, state and federal law enforcement officials who continue to work to ensure justice is served.”

(Photo by Jan Sonnenmair/Getty Images)The West Virginia Supreme Court will review a lower court’s ruling that would loosen the state’s strict school vaccination requirements by allowing exceptions for those who object on religious and philosophical grounds. 
The high court on Friday granted a request from attorneys representing the West Virginia Board of Education that its appeal of Raleigh County Circuit Judge Michael Froble’s ruling bypass the state Intermediate Court of Appeals and go directly to the Supreme Court for consideration. 
In their filing, the attorney argued the case is time sensitive and of public importance.
“Measles is proliferating in nearby states,” they wrote. “Pertussis killed three children in Kentucky in the past year. Childhood vaccination rates continue to decrease. Through it all, West Virginia’s Vaccine Law serves as a bulwark for public health, driving West Virginia to the highest  kindergarten vaccination rate in the nation. Whether [Equal Protection for Religion Act]  allows parties, like Respondents, to opt out of the longstanding Vaccine Law is of paramount public importance to West Virginia’s  population — especially its teachers and its children.”
The lawsuit was filed by Raleigh County parents Miranda Guzman and Carley Hunter, who were granted a religious exemption to the state’s school vaccination rules under an executive order from Gov. Patrick Morrisey. Schools across the country generally require students to be vaccinated against a series of infectious diseases like polio, measles and chickenpox. West Virginia’s school vaccine law has been one of only a handful in the country that do not allow religious or philosophical exemptions to the requirements.
Morrisey’s order is based on the state’s Equal Protection for Religion Act of 2023. The governor has not rescinded the order even though state lawmakers rejected a bill that would have made the exemptions part of the law. 
The state Board of Education directed county boards of education not to accept religious exemptions.
Froble issued a statewide ruling Nov. 26 prohibiting the state and Raleigh County boards of education from using the state’s vaccination law to deny school entrance to anyone who had sought or been granted a religious or philosophical exemption to the school vaccination requirements days later, the Supreme Court granted a stay of Froble’s ruling.
In their appeal last week, attorneys for the school wrote that the Raleigh County Circuit Court erred by, among other things, grafting a religious exemption onto the state’s vaccination law, finding that the Equal Protection for Religion Act makes no distinction between religious philosophical objections to vaccines, finding that the vaccine law substantially burdens the plaintiff’s religious freedom and by certifying a statewide class that exceeds the circuit court’s jurisdiction.

Thomas Massie speaks with reporters inside the U.S. Capitol building on Wednesday, Sept. 3, 2025. (Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)Kentucky Republican U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie called President Donald Trump’s comments following the deaths of Hollywood director Rob Reiner and his wife, producer Michele Singer Reiner, “inappropriate and disrespectful discourse.” 
The congressman on Monday also questioned if other Republicans would join him in decrying Trump’s statement. 
Trump blamed the couple’s deaths on the director having a case of “TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME” in a lengthy Truth Social post earlier that morning. 
Massie’s criticism soon followed in an X post. 
“Regardless of how you felt about Rob Reiner, this is inappropriate and disrespectful discourse about a man who was just brutally murdered,” Massie wrote. “I guess my elected GOP colleagues, the VP, and White House staff will just ignore it because they’re afraid? I challenge anyone to defend it.” 
The Reiners were found dead Sunday at their home in Los Angeles. Nick Reiner, a son of the couple, was in police custody Monday morning and “booked for murder,” Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell said in a press conference. The director was known for supporting progressive causes. 
Trump’s comments included that Reiner, “a tortured and struggling, but once very talented movie director and comedy star,” and his wife had died “reportedly due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME.” However, police have not released a motive in the case as of Monday. 
The “syndrome” is a pejorative used by the president and his supporters to describe those who oppose anything Trump does. 
Massie has already opposed Trump and gained his ire on various issues this year, including leading the charge to release the federal investigation files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Trump has vowed to unseat Massie and backed a primary challenger to the Northern Kentucky incumbent, Shelbyville Republican Ed Gallrein, in the 4th Congressional District.

(Courtesy of Duke Rodriguez)Duke Rodriguez, a cannabis company CEO and cabinet secretary under former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson, on Sunday formally announced his Republican candidacy for governor.
Rodriguez for months had been publicly weighing whether or not to run. He previously told Source NM that a recent state Supreme Court decision — which denied requests he made in a lawsuit to stop the governor from certain line-item vetoes — was possibly “the final push I needed to officially enter this race.” In an interview with Source NM Monday, he said that was indeed his deciding factor. 
He made the announcement Sunday in a full-page paid advertisement on the backpage of the Albuquerque Journal’s front section. The ad said he viewed a “huge announcement party” for his campaign as “a waste” and wrote that he would “rather get to work making our state better.”
Rodriguez told Source NM he’s dismayed at the way the state’s population has remained stagnant while the amount of the state budget grows. He said he wants to ensure New Mexicans have access to core healthcare services, bring higher pay for teachers and expand services for mental health and addiction treatment.
“We are not a poor state,” he said. “We are absolutely a poorly run state.”
His campaign website lists five priorities: crime, healthcare, education, safety and stability. 
In line with what state GOP officials have called a priority for the upcoming legislative session in January, Rodriguez’s platform calls for an end to “the revolving door for violent offenders.” He also said he wants to strengthen rural hospitals, achieve statewide literacy by third grade for New Mexico’s children, “end unsafe encampments” for unhoused populations and establish term limits for state elected offices.
He said he believes his policies — “concepts of compassion” — can unite both sides of the aisle in the Democrat-controlled Legislature.
Prior to running Ultra Health Cannabis, Rodriguez led the state Human Services Department and worked as an executive in the Lovelace Health System.
“I am pretty proud of my life in New Mexico,” he said. “If anyone owes a debt to this great state, it’s me.”
In a Monday statement, the Democratic Governors Association said Republican candidates for governor would put “health care in jeopardy for 90,000 New Mexicans.”
“With Duke Rodriguez’s entrance into the Republican primary for governor, he joins a field of candidates who will have to own Donald Trump’s destructive and deeply unpopular agenda that jacks up costs for working families, puts health care in jeopardy for 90,000 New Mexicans, and threatens rural hospitals, all to give tax breaks to the ultra-wealthy,” DGA spokesperson Izzi Levy wrote.
Rodriguez is set to face Rio Rancho Mayor Gregg Hull and freshman state Sen. Steve Lanier (R-Aztec) in the June 2, 2026 primary race.
In the Democratic primary, announced candidates are former U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, Bernalillo County District Attorney Sam Bregman and former Las Cruces Mayor Ken Miyagishima.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image3-scaled-e1765818842509-1024x890.jpeg,,,2025-12-15 12:58:14.618597

Ron DeSantis announces his proposed budget from the Capitol on Feb. 3, 2025. (Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Gov. Ron DeSantis is confident that his proposed “AI Bill of Rights” to crack down on unfettered artificial intelligence would not violate President Donald Trump’s new executive order invalidating certain state-level AI regulations.
But if it does draw a lawsuit from the Department of Justice, DeSantis thinks Florida would win.
“I’m not concerned about the recent executive order, because it doesn’t apply against the states directly,” DeSantis said Monday, speaking during a Jupiter roundtable alongside three parents whose children were harmed by AI chatbots.
“I don’t think we’re gonna be doing anything that would even give rise to a Dormant Commerce Clause lawsuit from the U.S. DOJ but, to the extent we did, I’m confident that we’d be able to win that because, clearly, we’d be legislating within the confines of our 10th Amendment rights as states,” he continued.
The anti-AI panel was DeSantis’ latest stab at raising the alarm over unregulated artificial intelligence. For months, he has hinted at proposing legislation — revealing an outline last week — and has long spoken out against the costs of AI data centers, the danger AI presents to children, and the hazard of foreign-owned AI models being adopted by Americans.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
He continued to hammer away at those points Monday, pausing briefly to deride the U.S. House of Representatives for approving a 10-year moratorium on states regulating AI.
Although the U.S. Senate stripped that provision out of the “Big Beautiful Bill” before Trump signed it into law, the move signaled a deepening split on the right over whether to fan the AI flames or stifle them. This divide became apparent when Trump early in his second term allied himself with tech billionaires like Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg.
“What [Congress said] is, we don’t want California doing things that are woke or all this other stuff. Like, yeah, I mean, I don’t either, but that’s not a reason to take away Florida’s rights,” DeSantis said. “Are you kidding me? And second of all, these [tech] companies, their muscle memory is to be woke. They don’t need California to tell them.”
Megan Garcia and her husband Sewell Setzter joined DeSantis to tell the story of how their 14-year-old son, Sewell Setzter III, was sexually groomed by an AI chatbot nicknamed “Daenerys Targaryen.” The bot, created through the platform Character.AI, tried to convince Setzter to “come home to her.” He committed suicide in February.
Another mom, Mandi Furness from Texas, explained how her autistic son was groomed by one of these chatbots. The bot told her son to call child protective services on his parents when they attempted to take his phone away, encouraged him to self-harm, and even claimed that cutting off his access to the app justified killing them.
The teenager attempted to commit suicide, and only recently was released from a mental institution, Furness said.
“We lost our son. He’s still alive, but I don’t know if he’ll ever be the same,” she added.
What’s in Trump’s executive order?
Trump signed his executive order on AI last week. The document aims to create a federal standard for AI regulation that isn’t undermined by a “patchwork” of varying state laws.
It directs Attorney General Pam Bondi to create an “AI Litigation Task Force” within 30 days whose “sole responsibility shall be to challenge State AI laws” that run afoul of the order; Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to identify which laws require “AI models to alter their truthful outputs;” and White House AI czar David Sacks and director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy Michael Kratsios to recommend language for a federal statute preempting state laws regulating AI, NBC reported.
These recommendations won’t touch state AI laws regulating child-safety protections, data center infrastructure, or state procurement of AI — all matters DeSantis has emphasized in his “Bill of Rights.”
“To win, United States AI companies must be free to innovate without cumbersome regulation.  But excessive State regulation thwarts this imperative,” Trump’s order reads.
“The resulting framework must forbid State laws that conflict with the policy set forth in this order.  That framework should also ensure that children are protected, censorship is prevented, copyrights are respected, and communities are safeguarded.”",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_4133-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-15 12:58:14.618597

Baker earned a bachelor's degree at Kansas State Universities, and graduate degrees in Missouri and Arkansas. This September 2023 image is of ESU's Memorial Union. (Photo by Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A 30-year higher education administrator at Northwest Missouri State University will return to Kansas for the opportunity to serve as president of Emporia State University.
Matthew Baker, who grew up in Kansas and earned a psychology degree at Kansas State University, has been vice president of student affairs at NMSU in Maryville, Missouri, for the past 14 years. Baker is expected to begin leadership duties at ESU in March. He holds a master’s degree from University of Arkansas at Fayetteville and a doctorate in educational leadership from University of Missouri in Columbia.
“It is the honor of my career to return to Kansas to serve as the university’s next president,” Baker said. “I will forever be grateful to Northwest for all it has done for me and my family. It is because of the experiences Northwest provided me that I am able to step into this role.”
Blake Benson, chairman of the Kansas Board of Regents, said Baker was a “proven leader with extensive experience developing and implementing initiatives designed to help students succeed in college and after graduation.” The Board of Regents unanimously voted to hire Baker.
Baker replaced Ken Hush, who became ESU president in 2021 and was an unusual appointee due to his lack of a graduate degree. Hush received an undergraduate degree from ESU and had a lengthy career in the private sector, including work with Koch Industries.
Benson, on behalf of the Board of Regents, said Hush “consistently exhibited an unwavering commitment to serving ESU’s students and has worked hard to improve affordability and student success.”
Hush invited controversy by deciding in 2022 to fire about 30 tenured or tenure-track faculty and to eliminate a cluster of academic programs, which exacerbated the university’s enrollment decline. Hush’s unilateral dismissal of personnel prompted a wave of lawsuits, which have yet to be fully resolved.
During Hush’s time at ESU, the Kansas Legislature earmarked tens of millions of dollars in special funding to stabilize the university. In addition, an attorney employed by ESU led an effort to persuade the Legislature to retroactively undermine faculty tenure statewide.
Hush, who plans to retire this month from ESU, said he would donate $1.4 million, or the equivalent of his four years of salary at ESU, to the university. The money would be used over three years for student recruitment, scholarships and campus operations, officials said.
“This gift is in appreciation for the meaningful impact ESU has had on our community and on me, both as a student and in my role as president,” Hush said.
Baker has worked at the public, four-year Northwest Missouri State for more than 30 years. He began in 1993 as the university’s residence hall director. He was off campus from 1996 to 1998 while completing a master’s degree in higher education administration in Arkansas. He returned to Northwest Missouri State and moved through several administrative jobs before being named dean of students in 2008.
Baker said he would conduct a listening tour to better understand the needs of Emporia State. He said ESU would be marked, under his tenure, by “shared governance, enhance(d) communication.”
He said he would rely on data to chart ESU future, because benchmarks on student retention or recruitment would reveal “where our opportunities are, where our successes are, what we celebrate.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ESU-student-union-2023-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-15 12:58:14.618597

Of the 27 times a referendum has been placed on the Missouri ballot, voters have rejected the General Assembly’s actions all but twice (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).A portion of the signatures submitted last week to force a referendum on Missouri’s gerrymandered congressional district map won’t be reviewed before a Cole County judge rules on whether all should be checked.
People Not Politicians is challenging a decision by Secretary of State Denny Hoskins that no signatures collected before Oct. 14 — the day he certified the form of the referendum petition — are valid. 
In an order issued Friday, Circuit Judge Christopher Limmbaugh wrote that he will wait to issue his ruling while local election officials determine if the portion being checked is sufficient to place the issue on a statewide ballot.
Last week, People Not Politicians delivered 691 boxes of petition sheets bearing more than 305,000 signatures to Hoskins’ office. There are signatures from every county in the state, organizers said, and they have little doubt they will reach the threshold of about 110,000 signatures to make the 2026 ballot.
In a filing in the case, People Not Politicians stated that about 103,000 of the signatures were collected before the cutoff date.
The other 202,000 signatures should be checked before he makes a decision, Limbaugh ruled.
“Conceivably, this could be enough signatures to place the referendum on the ballot thereby mooting the issues presented in the case at bar,” he wrote.
The case, he wrote, will be “in abeyance until the requisite number of signatures have been certified or up until enough signatures have been rejected so as to prevent plaintiffs’ referendum from appearing on the ballot.”
Limbaugh presided over a three-hour trial in the case last Monday. 
Limbaugh ordered Hoskins to hold on to the signatures not sent to local election authorities for verification while the case is on hold. When the signatures were submitted, Hoskins said he was already acting to preserve the early signatures.
County clerks and election boards have until July 28 to finish checking the signatures. 
Limbaugh has already ruled twice against opponents of the map forced through by the Republican majority during a September special session. 
Limbaugh ruled last week lawmakers had the constitutional authority to enact the revised map.
And in October, he declined to issue a temporary order blocking any of the actions during the special session in a case brought by the Missouri NAACP. That case is set for a trial Monday afternoon. 
The NAACP wants Limbaugh to declare that Gov. Mike Kehoe had no authority under the Missouri Constitution to call lawmakers into session for congressional redistricting and altering the majority needed to pass constitutional amendments proposed by initiative.
The fight over redistricting began in July, when President Donald Trump began pressuring Missouri Republicans to change the map to give the GOP an edge in seven of the state’s eight districts instead of the six they currently hold. 
Trump kept up the pressure during the special session and state Senate Republicans used rule changes to undercut Democratic opposition and muscle the map to passage.
Last week, Democratic attorney Brad Ketcher filed a complaint with the Missouri Ethics Commission alleging any White House employee calling lawmakers about the redistricting plan should have been registered as a lobbyist.
The intended result from the new map is to flip the 5th District to the GOP. The district, based in Kansas City, has been represented by Democratic U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver since 2005. 
The district is carved up under the new map with portions attached to the 4th and 6th Districts. Heavily Republican areas stretching along the Missouri River to Boone County would be added to the remaining Kansas City portions.
If the referendum has sufficient signatures, the map would be on the November 2026 ballot unless lawmakers set an earlier date.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Referendum-security-20251209-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-12-15 11:58:40.277174

A celebration of Bette Holt’s life will be announced and held in the spring.

Bette Jane Holt, of Bellows Falls passed away peacefully on Nov. 19, 2025, at home with family around her. She was born in Bethlehem, N.H. on July 5, 1934 to Inez Quimby Norman and William Norman.
Born and raised on a large farm, Bette developed an appreciation for self-sufficiency. During childhood she enjoyed picking berries and spending time outdoors. As a student at Bethlehem High School, Bette excelled in academics and enjoyed playing basketball and softball.
Shortly after graduation in 1952, Bette married the love of her life, Lloyd Holt. The couple eventually settled in Rockingham, where they built a home, developed the land and raised their children. Bette always had an abundant vegetable garden, sharing the bounty with family and friends.  Bette and Lloyd shared a passion for ballroom dancing. Together, they learned the art and often spent weekends dancing at nearby venues.
Following her husband’s sudden and tragic death in a work accident, Bette sought employment initially as an Avon representative and later for a local dentist, where she worked for many years.
Bette was a devoted sports fan, cheering for the Boston Red Sox and the New England Patriots through thick and thin. Though she loved New England, she had a notable dislike for winter, the only exception being the joy she found in feeding the birds and cooking. She enjoyed many trips throughout the Caribbean with friends. Bette also spent several weeks every summer camping at York Beach, Maine. Locally, Bette was a longtime member of the TOPS chapter. Bette had a keen eye for a bargain and enjoyed searching for treasures at local yard sales.
Bette’s warmth, generosity, and strong spirit will be deeply missed by all who knew her. She leaves behind a legacy of love, hard work, and a life well-lived. Bette is survived by her children, Victor Holt, Bradley Holt, Steven Holt (Tanya) and Valerie Barry (Stephen), eight grandchildren and nine great grandchildren, her sister Laura Jean Cornell (Bob) and many cousins, nieces and nephews. Bette was predeceased by her husband, Lloyd, her grandson, Daniel, and an infant daughter, Debra Lee.
A celebration of Bette Holt’s life will be announced and held in the spring.
Memorial donations may be made to the Springfield Humane Society or to the Bellows Falls Area Senior Center.

However, town leaders believe they are making some headway.
Randy Herbertson, chair of the town’s downtown improvement committee, says they are now juggling the need for parking space while encouraging walkability in the area.
“We are probably about 30% done,” Herbertson said.
The project includes dredging up the Saugatuck River, a pedestrian walkway and renovating existing municipal lots in the area. The plan has undergone revisions as a result of town concerns over parking availability.
Herbertson said the committee has taken those concerns into account, but local merchants are critical of increased parking limits and say it could hurt their businesses.
The town’s Planning and Zoning Commission wanted to keep as much parking space as possible. A parking study issued earlier this year recommended limiting parking time for on-street parking to two hours, encouraging more drivers to park at lots further away from the downtown area. The town implemented lower parking time limits in August.
The inital master revitalization plan for Reconnecting the Riverfront posted on April 10, 2025.
Herbertson said those changes and encouraging people to park further away could free up space for drivers while allowing pedestrians access to the walkway and green spaces.
“We wanted to change that up and make it more accessible, but at the same time, we really can’t, at this point, afford to lose parking inventory, so we’re trying to at least maintain (the) total amount of parking inventory we have today,” Herbertson said.
But merchants in the area like Alan Cohen, who owns ElixirSpa, say the lower parking time limits hurt his business. He said customers are looking for convenience.
Cohen said the new changes don’t take into account the habits of shoppers.
“They want to be able to just get in the car, come to Westport, expect to find parking, not to be relegated to a lot that’s a quarter of a mile away, simple as that,” Cohen said.
Cohen wants a parking structure to be built at the Baldwin lot but the parking study recommended the lowered parking time limits be implemented first, citing its expense, stating it would cost around $5 million for a parking deck and a three level parking structure to cost around $10 million.
Former member of the Representative Town Meeting Sal Lucchione said he’s hopeful Westport’s newly inaugurated Democratic First Selectman, Kevin Christie will listen to the concerns of small business owners.
“I call on our new first selectman who I supported to re-look at this, and look at a parking deck, and look at the two hour park, and it’s been not good for the merchants on Main Street,” Lucchione said.
Christie’s office was reached but Christie did not respond to a request for comment by Thursday afternoon.
Herbertson said the project might be completed by 2027.

It’s hard to believe that we’re already two weeks into the high school basketball season. With games being played all around the state, let’s take a look at some of the highlights from last week’s slate of games.
 
Odessa Remains Undefeated
The Ducks won all three of their games last week staying undefeated through the early part of the season. Odessa started the week with a four point victory against St. Elizabeth on Tuesday and then won another close game Thursday against St. Andrew’s. The Ducks concluded their week with a season high 72 point performance against Pennsylvania’s Freire Charter School on Saturday. Senior William Warfield scored double digit points in each game and finished with a 36 point total for the week.
Sanford Begins Championship Defense with 3-0 start
The Warriors complimented their season opening win against Mt. Pleasant High School with a pair of 65 point performances against St. Andrew’s and Tower Hill last week. Sanford won the DIAA state championship last season with the help of eight seniors, a group that included their top two scorers. This season, the Warriors have only one senior on the roster and only three members of the championship run remain, but the group is off to a strong start with a matchup against Odessa scheduled for Friday.
Cape Henlopen Starts Strong
The Vikings defeated a pair of down state opponents to stay undefeated on the new season. The Vikings defeated Smyrna on Tuesday behind a pair of 20-point performances from juniors Stephen Sivels and Jameson Tingle in a matchup of two quarterfinal teams from a season ago. On Thursday, Cape Henlopen traveled to Sussex Central where its defense held the Golden Knights under 30 points for their third victory of the season. Cape Henlopen will face last year’s state championship runner-up, Dover High School, on Tuesday at home in its only matchup scheduled for this week. Dover is 3-1 this season with its only loss coming against Bergen Catholic High School in New Jersey.
Conrad Opens Season with Two Straight Wins
The Redwolves played in last season’s state tournament as the fifth seed, but lost in a second round upset to Smyrna. This season’s team returns nine members from that squad and they’ve started the new season off strong with back-to-back wins against Brandywine and St. Mark’s. The Redwolves scored more than 70 points in each win and have received huge contributions from senior Vincent Starr. Starr scored over 20 points in each win this season doing a lot of his scoring from behind the arc with seven made three-pointers through the two games. Conrad is scheduled to play two games this week for the first time this season, starting with a road matchup against Concord on Tuesday and a home game against Mt.

In lieu of flowers, the family welcomes donations to the Ethan Allen Residence, the organization that cared for her in her last years.

Bonita Jeanne King Durell, a mother, educator, and sharp-witted friend, passed away peacefully on December 10, 2025, in Burlington, Vermont, at the Ethan Allen Residence, surrounded by the love of her family. She was 84. Born on March 29, 1941, in Malone, N.Y.
Bonita was a graduate of the College of New Rochelle, and obtained her masters degree from Hunter College. She began her career as a biology teacher at the New York Archdiocese, where her enthusiasm for learning left a lasting mark on her students. Her innate curiosity led her to a successful second career in technology, where she thrived managing technical teams for a global company from its Manhattan headquarters. She retired after 9/11.
She was predeceased by her parents, William A. King and Regina B. King; and her brother, Gregory J. King.
Bonita is survived by her children and their spouses — Sean Maloney, wife Andrea Maloney and granddaughters Caitlin and Ina Maloney; Kathleen Maloney and husband Robert Hooper; Noah Durell, wife Bethanne and grandchildren Parker and Logan; and Jacob “Jake” Durell and wife Jena Durell. She is also survived by her sisters, Denise “Peter” King Hegarty and husband Terence Hegarty, and Michelle King and husband Kevin Moran.
Bonita also leaves behind her beloved niece and nephews, Rebecca, Ian and Simon Hegarty. Each felt her support, keen interest in their lives, and the joy she took in their accomplishments.
Bonita’s love for the world was expansive — she read voraciously, delighted in classical music, and completed crosswords with enviable speed. She could find beauty anywhere: in nature, architecture, people, animals and in the small details others might overlook. She had a gift for describing what she saw with clarity and grace, leaving those around her newly aware of the wonder in everyday life. She was also a gifted artist and poet.
Her family will miss her sharp mind, humor, fierce loyalty, and ability to illuminate the world with words. The family wishes to express gratitude for the care she received from the nurses, staff and administration at The Ethan Allen Residence.

,Mississippi Today,2025-12-15 15:50:28+00:00,Mississippi Today,US Supreme Court will hear appeal of Black death row inmate over racial bias in Mississippi jury selection,Associated Press,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/12/15/mississippi-death-row-racial-bias/,The U.S. Supreme Court in the spring will hear the appeal of a Black death row inmate from Mississippi whose case was handled by a prosecutor with a history of dismissing Black jurors for discriminatory reasons.,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday agreed to hear the appeal of a Black death row inmate from Mississippi whose case was handled by a prosecutor with a history of dismissing Black jurors for discriminatory reasons.
A federal judge had previously overturned the murder conviction of the inmate, Terry Pitchford, but an appeals court reversed that ruling.
The justices stepped into the case involving the same prosecutor, former District Attorney Doug Evans, who was at the center of a high court case that resulted in a 2019 decision that overturned the death sentence and conviction of Curtis Flowers.
The case involving Pitchford will be argued in the spring.
U.S District Judge Michael P. Mills held that the judge who oversaw Pitchford’s trial didn’t give the man’s lawyer enough chance to argue that the prosecution was improperly dismissing Black jurors.
Mills wrote that his ruling was partially motivated by Evans’ actions in prior cases.
Pitchford was sentenced to death for his role in the 2004 killing of Reuben Britt, the owner of the Crossroads Grocery, just outside Grenada in northern Mississippi.
In Pitchford’s case, judges and lawyers whittled down the original jury pool of 61 white and 35 Black members to a pool with 36 white and five Black members, in part because so many Black jurors objected to sentencing Pitchford to death. Then prosecutors struck four more Black jurors, leaving only one Black person on the final jury.
The Supreme Court tried to stamp out discrimination in the composition of juries in Batson v. Kentucky in 1986. The court ruled then that jurors couldn’t be excused from service because of their race and set up a system by which trial judges could evaluate claims of discrimination and the race-neutral explanations by prosecutors.
When the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Flowers, Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote that Evans had engaged in a “relentless, determined effort to rid the jury of Black individuals.”
Flowers was tried six times in the shooting deaths of four people. He was released from prison in 2019 and the state dropped the charges against him the following year, after Evans turned the case over to state officials.
Evans resigned in mid-2023, after more than 30 years on the job and six months before the end of the four-year term he was then serving.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/14140954/AP25206037284214.jpg,,,2025-12-15 10:58:59.411275

New York City
Died Nov. 30. 2025
New Orleans, Louisiana
Details of services
Late May 2026 in Vermont. Exact location TBD.

Vermont troubadour, Elmore community icon, beloved by adults and children, Jon Gailmor died peacefully on Nov. 30, 2025, at his son’s home in New Orleans after a courageous battle with leukemia. He left this world to the sound of his family singing by his side.
Jon was born in Manhattan on Aug. 5, 1948 to William and Elaine Gailmor. After his early childhood in the Philadelphia area, the family moved to Westport, Connecticut where Jon attended Staples High School. There, under the direction of George Weigle, Jon sang in the choir and became a member of the select singing group The Orphenians. This gave Jon his first sense of musical camaraderie.
Also formative for Jon during his teen years, was the music of Pete Seeger, Woody Guthrie and Josh White. Jon developed political and social awareness from his father, a journalist and radio news commentator, and from his mother, an astute observer of the human condition.
After high school, Jon attended the University of Pennsylvania, where he joined the renowned Penn Glee Club, and was voted its President. This remained a most treasured time in his life. 
After college graduation, and following the early death of his father, Jon spent months hitchhiking across Europe, singing in cafés to earn his keep. His life during this unconventional and free-spirited time shaped his understanding of music, humanity and purpose.
Returning home in the early 1970s, Jon formed a folk duo with fellow Staples classmate Rob Carlson. Amidst gigs in coffeehouses, clubs and colleges, their album, “Peaceable Kingdom,” was released by major label Polydor Records. Jon quickly realized the bright lights of commercial music didn’t fit his heart, and that big fame wasn’t for him.
In 1977, Jon visited Vermont for the first time, fell in love with the sense of community, and decided to stay. He met and married Cathy Murphy, settled in Elmore to raise their family, and set his energies to creating a career, not about fame and fortune, but about caring and contribution. In the following decades, Jon became renowned as a community-centered singer, songwriter, performer, and educator, focusing especially on working with children and families. Over the years, he released several solo albums filled with self-penned songs combining humor, warmth, social awareness and humanity.
In 1979, Jon launched a weekly children’s music radio show, Just Kidding, which aired for more than two decades on the Waterbury radio station, WDEV. He also influenced generations of Vermont kids, through song-writing residencies in schools and other organizations, inspiring them to create their own music, to find their voices, to believe in themselves. This gift of helping others to feel heard, seen and valued was a hallmark of Jon’s life.
In October 2024, Jon moved to New Orleans to be closer to family and to focus on his health. He continued to write music, including a tribute song to the staff at the Ochsner Cancer Center, where he was lovingly and skillfully treated.
Jon loved his late wife, Cathy, with his whole heart.  He was proud beyond words of his children –  Aaron, Maya and Micaela – and never missed a soccer game, track meet, or school performance. “Papa” to his grandchildren Farrah and Cooper, Jon inspired in them a love of music. Cassie, his daughter-in-law was a light in his life, and she loved him as a second father. Jon adored his older sister Wendy and remained close to her, along with her late husband David, whom he loved as a brother. Jon cherished all of his extended family and close friends.
Donations in Jon’s honor may go to music education, either to your local school’s music program or to the Integrated Arts Academy, where Jon was a regular artist-in-residence. Checks can be sent to the IAA, 6 Archibald Street, Burlington, VT 05401, with “Jon Gailmor” in the memo line.
A celebration of Jon’s life will be held in late May 2026 in Vermont, the place he loved. Details will be available later.
Jon often said: “My reason for being is music.” Music brought him purpose, but what defined him was something deeper — love, kindness, and lifting hearts.
We love you, Dad, Papa, Brother, Friend.

Judges vacated her conviction and ordered the new trial. The state attorney general’s office has not said whether it plans to appeal the ruling to the Mississippi Supreme Court.
In 2024, Clay County Circuit Judge James Kitchens Jr. rejected Shelton’s request for a new trial, despite the state pathologist reversing his original ruling and saying the death was more likely a suicide.
The appeals court concluded Kitchens erred in denying Shelton’s request for a new trial. The court cited the pathologist’s reversal and the failure of defense lawyer Rod Ray to introduce the victim’s apparent suicide note into evidence at the murder trial.
Mississippi Innocence Project lawyers wrote that if it “offends the 8th and 14th Amendments to execute a person who could prove his actual innocence, then it offends the Constitution as well to consign her to prison for the remainder of her natural life for a crime she did not commit.” 
In 2015, a Clay County jury convicted Shelton of murder in the 2009 shooting death of her sister’s 21-year-old boyfriend, Danelle Young. Shelton, who was sentenced to life, won’t be eligible for parole until 2043.
The prosecution never presented a motive for why Shelton would have killed Young.
In April 2022, Kitchens presided over the last of three days of hearings over whether Shelton deserved a new trial. Those hearings revealed evidence never shown to the jury, including an apparent suicide note Young wrote.
In 2009, forensic pathologist Dr. Liam Funte ruled Young’s death a homicide, basing that decision on the trajectory of the bullet from the front of the chest to the back “without significant deviation to left or right.”
Under questioning by Shelton’s lawyer, Sandra Levick, Funte said at the time he had not seen that in a suicide, but he said he has seen such cases since and was “leaning toward suicide.”
In reversing the original ruling, he cited scientific studies on bullet trajectories in suicides and homicides. In one study, more than 36% of suicides had bullet trajectories that did not deviate to the left or right.
After a verbal argument in which Shelton’s sister said she told Young that she didn’t want to live with him, Young walked to Shelton’s trailer.
Shelton told authorities she was already in bed with her infant daughter when Young knocked on the window of the trailer. She went to the front door, and she said he told her that he only needed one bullet to kill a raccoon.
She said she replied that he might need more than one bullet and loaded her small .22 pistol and gave it to him.
After she heard a shot and he failed to return, she said she went outside, found him collapsed on the gravel driveway and called 911.
In the autopsy report, Funte concluded Young had been shot in the chest and that the gun was fired from less than an inch away.
Both he and another forensic pathologist, Dr. Randall Frost, demonstrated at hearings how the small gun could fire a self-inflicted shot, following the same path the bullet traveled through Young’s body.
Funte said he would now rule the death “undetermined.”
Kitchens never addressed the apparent suicide note in his 15-page decision. In that note, Young wrote, “I have no life without her (Shelton’s sister Ketina). … These are my last words. … Tell (your daughter) Treasure about me one day. Bye. Bye.”
At the hearing, Funte testified that the note would have been relevant to determining the manner of death.
“Considering the potentially exculpatory nature of this letter, we find it difficult to conclude that its absence did not prejudice Shelton’s defense,” Judge C.J. Barnes wrote for the appeals court in its 7-3 decision.
In his dissent, Judge John Emfinger wrote that a study provided by Shelton’s lawyers actually supports Funte’s original opinion of a homicide. That study showed that 82.4% of suicides were shots to the head and 16.3% were shots to the chest.
“So, according to that study, looking at those numbers, if it was a suicide, it would have been much more likely to be a shot to the head than to the chest, correct?” Special Assistant Attorney General Jackie Bost II asked Funte at the hearing.
“Yes,” Funte replied. “According to the study.”
This is why the trial judge determined that Funte’s change of opinion and the evidence used to support the changed opinion didn’t support reversal of the case, Emfinger wrote.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/06000613/IMG_3609-scaled.jpeg,,,2025-12-15 10:58:59.411275

(Photo courtesy of campaign)Charlie Schmidt, a former American Civil Liberties Union attorney and self-described progressive Democrat, won the Democratic nomination Sunday for the Jan. 6 special election in Virginia’s House District 77, securing his party’s nod to succeed Del. Mike Jones, D-Richmond.
Schmidt defeated former Richmond City Council President Michelle Mosby in a three-way primary, winning 639 votes to Mosby’s 488, according to results released Sunday night by the Democratic Party of Virginia. A third candidate, Gregory Powers, received 32 votes.
The seat was vacated earlier this month after Jones was elected to fill a state Senate vacancy created by Lt. Gov.-elect Ghazala Hashmi’s elevation to statewide office. House District 77 includes portions of the city of Richmond and Chesterfield County and is considered strongly Democratic. No Republican has announced plans to run.
Schmidt framed his victory as part of a broader political shift in Virginia, pointing to Democratic gains in statewide and legislative races during the Nov. 4 elections.
“The 2025 election cycle has been a historic one for Virginia Democrats,” Schmidt said in a statement. “Our party has not only won three executive seats, we have also seen a 13-seat gain in the legislative assembly, and a shift blue in every single district across the state.”
He described those results as more than electoral wins, calling them “a movement” and “a mandate to govern,” while emphasizing what he said is the party’s responsibility to translate power into policy. Schmidt said the vision he plans to carry into the Jan. 6 election is “a legislative agenda for working people, by working people.”
In his statement, Schmidt outlined a range of issues he said are affecting residents of the 77th District and communities across the state, including rising costs of housing, food and health care, environmental concerns and school funding. He also highlighted immigration enforcement as a source of fear for many families.
“Working families struggle with insufficient wages stacked against skyrocketing costs of very basic needs like housing, food, and healthcare,” Schmidt said. “Access to clean air and water is not guaranteed. Our schools are critically under-funded. Families live in fear of immigration raids that divide and terrorize.”
Schmidt said those challenges are shared across Virginia, regardless of geography, and argued that Democrats have an obligation to address them.
“The people of Virginia have a right to live with dignity and security,” he said. “It is the duty of the Democratic Party to deliver this vision.”
Mosby entered the race with significant backing from prominent Democratic officials, including Jones, Richmond Mayor Danny Avula, Sen. Lashrecse Aird, D-Petersburg, and Del. Delores McQuinn, D-Richmond, among others.
In a statement, Sen. Lamont Bagby, D-Henrico, chairman of the Democratic Party of Virginia, praised Schmidt’s campaign and background.
“Charlie Schmidt ran on providing dignity, safety, and opportunity to all Virginians,” Bagby said. 
“His legal and community experience will serve him well in the House of Delegates and I look forward to welcoming him to both the General Assembly and to the Richmond delegation.”

The p[...]","EPISODE INFO

HOST: Jennifer Smith
GUEST: Élider DiPaula, Executive Director of Project STEP







THE HOLIDAYS MEAN more people than usual may find Tchaikovsky’s music waltzing through their heads on sugar plum feet, but classical music does not have a reputation as the most accessible or diverse art form. And a decades-old Boston area program aimed at expanding who hears and plays classical musical found that very mission put it and other arts programs on the chopping block for federal grants. 
Project STEP, which gives students from traditionally underrepresented backgrounds classic string training, lost $55,000 pledged from the National Endowment for the Arts, and programs across the state aimed at expanding access to the arts saw similar cuts. 
In March, it was estimated that around 150 programs are losing more than $5 million in grants, according to the Boston Globe. The rationale offered in letters was that the funding would be redirected to “projects that reflect the nation’s rich artistic heritage and creativity as prioritized by the President.” 
Élider DiPaula, a Brazilian-born composer and new executive director of Project STEP, took the helm six months after the NEA cuts were announced. He came to Boston from Chicago, where he founded and led Project 88 Music Academy — a Chicago area organization aimed at “revitalizing classical music” through building up new generations of artists and diversifying audiences. 
“We want to normalize people feeling comfortable with who they are, to act how they are, and to produce the art that they want,” DiPaula told CommonWealth Beacon reporter Jennifer Smith on The Codcast. “Of course there are constraints, and I think politics is to help establish some of those constraints. But when the policies are solely to suppress a group — to quiet a few communities — that becomes a bad type of political move, and we don’t partake in that type of agenda. We want to expand. We don’t want to oppress.” 
Project STEP was founded in the 1980s by a former member of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, which was struggling to find musicians from underrepresented groups to audition for open spots. A significant problem, he and others realized, was the pipeline itself.  
“We as a society, as a group, as a nation, do not support a foundational step in in the development of a child,” DiPaula said. “We do have the demand,” he said of aspiring young string musicians. “We don’t have the skillset built on par with what is expected of them.” 
Project STEP’s core program is available for students from underrepresented or marginalized backgrounds in 1st through 12th grades and involves intensive string instruments training through private lessons, orchestra rehearsals, and public performances. And the price tag for running the program is steep — a 12-year music education through Project STEP costs about $140,000 roughly for each student, according to the 2025-2028 strategic plan. The annual $350 fee, which may be mostly covered by financial aid, covers about 5 percent of the actual direct instruction costs. 
NEA funding is not a main pillar of the program, but losing grants they have relied on for at least 25 years “creates a strain” that then needs to be offset by individual supporters, DiPaula said. People are aware of the issue now, he said, and are trying to offset the loss, but that can be difficult to sustain.  
“I think the administration knew that could be the case,” he said of the surge in community support, “but they also understand that it’s not sustainable in the long run. And they hope that the longer they hold this funding from organizations that we are going to exhaust our donors, exhaust our supporters. And they hope that we are going to collapse in that way.” 
Other programs have reeled and scrambled to fill the gaps though emergency fundraisers.  
For DiPaula, the political backlash cycles against certain types of arts is becoming “predictable” — not easy but possible to weather. Doing so requires getting  support from the same communities they’ve worked to build and expand. 
“We see that same type of problem recurring, and with time and experience, we’ve learned how to manage this,” DiPaula said. “And I think one thing they’re not accounting for, when they make those plans to attack us, is that we are resilient.” 
On the episode, DiPaula discusses the loss of grant funding (7:00), what it means to have equity in mind in the classical music world (16:00), and the politics of art (25:00).",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/The-Codcast_Wide-Banner.png?fit=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-15 10:58:59.411275

BRATTLEBORO — Brattleboro Memorial Hospital is reporting the departure of its chief financial officer just weeks after the exit of its CEO amid a projected $14.5 million annual budget shortfall.
The 500-employee not-for-profit facility — the main health care provider for about 55,000 people in southeastern Vermont — has replaced CFO Laura Bruno with interim leader David Sanville, a former executive at hospitals in Berlin, Randolph and Windsor, it said in a press release sent after the close of business Friday. 
Sanville will be assisted by Patrick Nudo, a national Ovation Healthcare consultant who will serve as senior finance director, the release added.  
“These decisions were made after careful consideration and reflects our commitment to maintaining the highest standards of leadership and accountability within our organization,” the hospital said in a written statement. “Our focus now is on ensuring a smooth transition and continuing to deliver on our mission without interruption.”
Administrators released no other information, and Bruno couldn’t be reached for comment.
The 61-bed hospital — one of Brattleboro’s three largest employers — has reported a string of annual losses since 2021 and entered a state review hearing this past August with fears of another shortfall.
“We recognize we are in a bad financial condition,” Bruno said at the online meeting. “We have some ways to go.”

But the hospital nonetheless unveiled a proposed 2026 fiscal year budget at the summer hearing that estimated $121 million in spending and a $244,529 surplus as of next Sept. 30.
In response, regulators at Vermont’s Green Mountain Care Board questioned the accuracy of those figures and ordered the hospital to recalculate its budget or risk becoming the first health care facility to receive state intervention under a new law. 
Soon after, the hospital announced CEO Christopher Dougherty was taking an unexplained leave of absence in October before he exited permanently without comment in November.
Earlier this month, a set of acting leaders and several outside advisers sent the state an updated $130 million budget for the 2026 fiscal year that projected a $14.5 million operating loss.
Past and present administrators have blamed the hospital’s fiscal problems on everything from too many unpaid patient bills to their own staff’s rising health insurance costs, spurring them to launch a hiring freeze and let go of several managers.
The hospital’s acting leaders are continuing to review budget numbers as they search for a new CEO and CFO, they said Friday at a meeting of community members who act as advisory corporators.
Regulators have yet to announce whether they’ll hold another review hearing but believe the updated $14.5 million projected loss is “an accurate representation,” they recently said in a written statement.

(Photo by Craig McCaa/U.S. Bureau of Land Management)Though the state of Alaska is anticipating more oil production in the fiscal year that starts July 1, money from oil continues to make up a dwindling share of general-purpose state revenue, according to a forecast published Wednesday by the Alaska Department of Revenue.
The projection, one of two per year published by the department, was released in conjunction with Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s draft budget for fiscal year 2027. 
Altogether, the state expects to earn $6.2 billion in general-purpose dollars between July 1, 2026 and June 30, 2027, the next fiscal year. Officially known as “unrestricted general fund revenue,” it’s the section of the budget where lawmakers and governors focus most of their attention. 
Federal money and money designated for specific programs can sometimes be shifted around to different priorities, but not easily. General-fund dollars can (and are) assigned to different priorities each year. 
The forecast for next year’s unrestricted general fund revenue is higher by almost $260 million than the current year’s expectation, but most of that increase isn’t coming from oil.
Since 2018, an annual transfer from the Alaska Permanent Fund to the state treasury has been the No. 1 source of general-purpose dollars for services and the Permanent Fund dividend. 
That’s more true than ever, according to the state forecast. 
In the next fiscal year, just 23% of the state’s general-purpose revenue is expected to come from petroleum revenue — royalties, property taxes and production taxes.
The Permanent Fund transfer would account for almost 66% of the general-purpose money. 
That difference comes despite an expectation that oil production will rise significantly between this fiscal year and next — from an average of 457,000 barrels of oil per day to 517,800 per day on average.
According to the Alaska Department of Natural Resources, that’s due to the startup of production in the Pikka oil field and other new production on the North Slope.
Despite that new production, oil revenue is expected to rise only slightly — from $1.43 billion to $1.44 billion.
That’s because the state is expecting North Slope oil prices to average just $62 per barrel during the next fiscal year, down from $65.48 in the current fiscal year.
At the same time, the Permanent Fund transfer is rising by almost $200 million, causing oil to become a still-smaller share of state revenue.
Even though revenue is expected to rise between the current fiscal year and the next one, the projected deficit in Dunleavy’s proposed spending plan stands at more than $1.8 billion.
If oil revenue alone were needed to fill that deficit, average North Slope prices would have to be near $100 per barrel, or the state would have to produce more than 1.2 million barrels of oil per day during the next fiscal year, an amount that is geologically, economically and mechanically unfeasible. The state hasn’t posted an annual average of over 1 million barrels of North Slope oil per day since the turn of the century.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/54401329128_4e1543082e_o-resized-1024x751.jpg,,,2025-12-15 09:57:21.961342

While this is sound advice, you may have lingering questions about how to construct an investment portfolio or whether certain times are more opportune for investing. You might also be curious about whether you should focus on specific types of investments, such as stocks or bonds, or explore real estate and other commodities.
There isn’t a one-size-fits-all answer. While some strategies can benefit nearly all investors, your investment choices should align with your future financial plans – both short-term and long-term.
Here are four key strategies for building your investment portfolio and how to get started:
Learn what makes up an investment portfolio
Begin by familiarizing yourself with what an investment portfolio entails. A portfolio is a collection of investments that often includes an array of asset classes such as equities, or stocks, representing ownership stakes in corporations; fixed income securities including bonds, and tangible commodities like precious metals or agricultural products. Investors often view their investments as a whole through their portfolio to track their progress. encompassing a diverse
Assess your risk tolerance
Investment strategies are not universal. If your goal is to minimize risk and preserve your principal investment, consider a conservative portfolio with assets like bonds, which can be less prone to significant losses. Although a conservative portfolio could yield lower returns, it may be suitable if you’re nearing retirement and will need your funds soon—or if you simply prefer to minimize risk.
Conversely, a high-growth portfolio involves investing in higher-risk assets that can yield more substantial gains or losses. While it’s often recommended that younger people invest more aggressively since they have more time to recover from potential losses, it’s more about how soon you hope to achieve your investment goals.
You might opt for a balanced approach, diversifying your investments across multiple asset classes.
Diversify your portfolio
Plan to distribute your investments across different types of securities. For example, avoid concentrating all your money in a single stock, as a downturn in that stock could jeopardize your entire portfolio.
It’s also recommended not to put your money solely in one asset class (for example, just stocks) – instead, it’s generally better to spread your investments across different types of securities with different levels of risk.
This approach can help protect your money. For instance, you have money invested in several asset classes like bonds, stocks and commodities, and the bond market falls, only part of your investment portfolio will be affected.
Think long-term, no matter your goals
Regardless of strategy and allocation, it’s generally advisable to maintain a long-term perspective, as this allows for the compounding of returns and the ability to weather short-term market fluctuations. For investors, maintaining a long-term mindset can pave the way for success. Although markets can always have a bad day, week, month or even year, history suggests investors are less likely to experience losses over longer periods—especially in a diversified portfolio.
Reacting with fear during market downturns and withdrawing your investments could mean missing out on potential rebounds, which is why investors should focus on time in the market, not timing the market. Over the last 20 years, seven of the 10 best days occurred within 15 days of the 10 worst days.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A Washburn University law professor hopes news coverage of a former prosecutor’s conduct will bring attention to the problem of attorneys sexually abusing or harassing their clients, a focal point of her research.
Part of the problem: That’s not why Linus Thuston is on trial this week.
Thuston, the former Neosho County prosecutor, faces three low-level felony perjury charges for his testimony last year in a drug case in which he claimed to invite off-the-books confidential informants to his house to gather information for police. Some of the people he named as informants disputed his claims, according to a court document that was unsealed at Kansas Reflector’s request. Thuston is also charged with two misdemeanor crimes, accused of trying to intimidate two of the people who said he was lying.
But Thuston, who also ran a private law practice, has not faced charges or disciplinary action for convincing 50 women to send him nude photos in exchange for legal services, according to a sheriff’s investigation.
Gillian Chadwick, director of the Center for Children and Family Law at Washburn University, has researched cases in which attorneys took advantage of vulnerable clients and faced little consequence. She wrote a paper on the topic that calls for reforms in the legal profession, and is conducting an online survey to hear from victims.
Thuston’s case is unique, she said, because there were so many people involved.
“I don’t think it speaks well of the system that this is where we are with this case,” Chadwick said. “I think the fact that the sheriff credibly reports providing documentation of him essentially sexually extorting 50 women whom he knew in a professional capacity, either as clients or complaining witnesses or defendants, and no legal action has been taken on those facts, is concerning.”
Thuston’s attorney didn’t respond to a Kansas Reflector inquiry for this story.
 
Exploiting vulnerable clients
Chadwick represented victims of domestic and sexual violence as an attorney in Washington, D.C., before joining the Washburn law faculty in 2016.
When she arrived in Kansas, she said, she came across a case where an attorney had been disciplined for sexual violence against a client and was shocked the person was still practicing law. She started to look more closely at the legal profession and how such cases are handled.
Chadwick’s 2022 research paper, “Time’s Up for Attorney-Client Sexual Violence,” concluded that attorneys nationwide had been allowed to prey on marginalized and desperate clients with impunity. Lawyers hold “profound” power over their clients, she argued, especially when they take cases pro bono, which means they aren’t paid, and in criminal and family law cases.
“The consequences of losing one’s liberty, custody of children, and even parental rights create incredibly high stakes for clients in these practice areas. Criminal and family lawyers often work in solo or small firm practice. This combination of distressed clients and isolated office settings makes clients in these environments especially vulnerable,” she wrote in the paper published by the University of Maryland Law Journal of Race, Religion, Gender and Class.
Common threads in the cases she examined: little or no dispute about the facts, but a gross misunderstanding of consent.
Among the examples in her paper was an Ohio attorney who coerced an indigent criminal defendant into having sex with him eight times, lied to a judge about the relationship and was charged with sex crimes. The charges were dismissed in exchange for pleading guilty to misdemeanor trespassing and obstructing government business. A disciplinary board concluded the client had benefited from the arrangement of trading sex for services and gave the attorney a six-month suspension from practicing law.
Chadwick’s paper recommended the legal profession ban sexual contact with clients and disbar attorneys who break the rule. She also argued for the legal profession to develop prevention strategies, including mandatory education about sexual violence.
“What I saw in the cases that I looked at is women who are in really difficult circumstances, who were facing something really difficult, were facing the loss of their liberty, the loss of their children, and their attorney was using that vulnerability to exploit them,” Chadwick said in an interview. “I can’t imagine how traumatizing that is to be experiencing trauma and then to be victimized by the person who is supposed to be helping.”
Chadwick’s research has led her to a new project: Gathering voices of people who were victimized by their attorneys through the anonymous online survey.
“We know from the research that those are people who struggle to be believed and understood by the legal system,” Chadwick said. “They have justifiable mistrust for the legal system. And so I think that’s a huge issue.”
 
Photos and testimony
Neosho County Sheriff Greg Taylor revealed last year that a woman had complained in 2022 that Thuston asked her to send him nude photos to continue providing legal services. The woman told the sheriff she begrudgingly sent the photos because she felt like she had no other choice.
Taylor said he opened an investigation into sexual extortion and, with a warrant for Thuston’s social media messages, identified about 50 women who complied with Thuston’s requests for nude photos in exchange for legal services through his private practice. Thuston also had prosecuted about a third of those women, Taylor said.
Separate from that investigation, the state’s disciplinary office for attorneys issued Thuston an informal admonishment last year for telling a woman she owed him oral sex.
When Thuston took the stand last year as a witness in a hearing for a drug case, he admitted he exchanged salacious photos with a woman he described as a confidential informant. Under scrutiny from the special prosecutor and defense attorney, he testified he frequently met privately with off-the-books confidential informants, sometimes at his home or in other discreet places around town. He named several men he claimed were secretly giving him information about drug deals.
Thuston retired as prosecutor soon after testifying in that case and pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor financial crimes. In December, he was charged with lying under oath.
His defense attorney, Robert Myers, tried to block Kansas Reflector’s request to release the charging affidavit in the case.
“The release of the affidavit has great likelihood of finding a fair and impartial jury nearly impossible,” Myers wrote in his objection. “The number of articles with statements from agents of the State have already began to taint the potential jury pool.”
Myers also wrote that “any part of the affidavit that makes reference to any type of sexual behavior is unrelated to the alleged crime.”
“Any reference to pictures exchanged have nothing to do with the present charges and is an invasion of privacy,” Myers added.
The judge sided with Kansas Reflector and allowed the affidavit to become public, with redactions of explicit material.
The affidavit shows three men Thuston had identified as confidential informants were worried about being called “a snitch.” One of the men told a sheriff’s deputy his kids were at risk.

If approved by state utility regulators, the new transmission line would connect existing electrical substations in Callaway and Montgomery Counties to the multi-state Grain Belt Express, a power line carrying energy from Kansas to Indiana.
Ameren submitted a request to build, own and operate the proposed line to the Missouri Public Service Commission in November.
Samuel Gardner is the project manager with Ameren Transmission and said the new powerline is necessary due to increasing energy production across the Midwest.
The Grain Belt Express, to which the proposed Mid-Missouri powerline would connect, is the “biggest transmission line in U.S. history” and is expected to add 5 gigawatts of energy to the system, the equivalent to four nuclear power plants, according to the company.
“With the influx of energy in central Missouri, there’s a need to basically transmit that energy so that’s really what is driving the project,” Gardner said.
The Midcontinent Independent System Operator, or MISO, is the regional grid operator for northeast Missouri and 15 other states. The organization acts as a sort of air traffic controller for energy demand, supply and transmission among the utilities in its territory.
A study conducted by the grid operator revealed a need for “significant system upgrades in the region,” according to Ameren.
“We have to provide non-discriminatory access to the grid,” Gardner said. “When a generator wants to connect, we’re federally obliged to work with them.”
The 30-mile route of the proposed transmission line has been identified and an interactive map of the proposed electric line can be found on Ameren’s website. Nearly 100% of the “preferred corridor” is parallel to existing Ameren right-of-way, according to the company.
“Our primary goal throughout the project will be to work with the local community and minimize landowner and agricultural impact,” the company website states. “We care about your property rights and want to be good neighbors in the communities we’ve served for more than 100 years.”
Ameren needs state approval before building the new transmission line. The Missouri Public Service Commission is expected to make a decision on the project next year. The company aims to build the powerline in 2029.
The public is able to give feedback to state regulators and the utility company.
Gardner said Invenergy, the company behind the much-challenged Grain Belt Express, is “paying for the vast majority of this upgrade.” The remaining cost will be paid by Ameren. As a regulated investor-owned utility, the company has the ability to recoup investments through rates paid by customers.
Invenergy would not confirm details on the project’s financing and denied participation in this report.
Gardner said Ameren Missouri held four local open houses about the project and incorporated feedback from landowners and community members in its application to state regulators.

(Photo courtesy of Ryo Hamasaki)Over the past few months, we’ve watched with growing concern as divisive and dangerous rhetoric about immigrants — particularly Somali Minnesotans — has gained traction in headlines and on social media. These narratives paint entire communities with a broad, negative brush, ignoring the real stories of resilience, contribution and connection happening every day in our neighborhoods.
We’re writing today not as politicians or pundits, but as founders of a community-driven effort, Futsal Society and Fawkes Alley Coffee, where people can come together, find common ground and build opportunity. Blending in doesn’t mean giving up who you are — it means finding what we all share.
Futsal Society started in 2016 as a handful of friends playing pickup soccer at Whittier Rec Center in south Minneapolis. It wasn’t long before kids began showing up — kids who love the game but didn’t have access to organized sports. Many were first-generation immigrants, including Somali youth, who faced barriers like cost, transportation and lack of safe spaces to play.
One of those kids was Bishar Mohamed. Bishar’s passion for soccer was undeniable, and his positive energy was infectious to everyone he encountered. We had stumbled across a need in the community, and Bishar worked with us to spread the word, organize his peers and design free programs. Before long, we had packed gyms with lines out the door. 
What began as grassroots pickup games has grown into a citywide movement offering clinics, leagues and tournaments for hundreds of Twin Cities youth every year. Today, our program has served nearly 1,300 young people from 48 different countries and 68 high schools. More than half of players are first-generation immigrants. These aren’t just numbers; they represent stories of kids who’ve come out of their shells, learned leadership and found belonging.
Futsal — a fast-paced, small-sided version of soccer — is perfect for urban neighborhoods. It requires minimal space and equipment, making it accessible to all. Beyond the logistical advantages, futsal builds creativity, teamwork and confidence. It’s a sport that teaches kids how to trust themselves and others — skills that matter on and off the court.
As Futsal Society grew, we saw another need: sustainable funding and workforce opportunities for the very youth we serve. That’s where Fawkes Alley Coffee comes in.
Located in Loring Park, Fawkes Alley is more than a café — it’s a nonprofit hub where every cup fuels opportunity. We employ former Futsal Society players, providing jobs, mentorship and career support. All profits are reinvested into youth programs and futsal court development. It’s a model that connects enterprise with equity, proving that business can — and should — serve the community.

Through this work, we’ve witnessed incredible transformations. Kids who were shy and isolated now lead teams, coach younger players, and work behind the counter at Fawkes Alley. We’ve seen kids from different countries, who speak entirely different languages, laughing together after a hard-fought match. We’ve seen parents from different cultures cheering side by side, and volunteer coaches driving van loads of young people to participate, sometimes from as far as St. Cloud.
These moments remind us that assimilation isn’t about erasing identity — it’s about finding common ground and purpose. Soccer and coffee might seem simple, but they’re powerful tools for connection.
Here’s the truth: If you only read headlines or scroll through takes on X, you’ll miss what’s really happening in our communities. 
You’ll miss the joy on a kid’s face when they score their first goal. You’ll miss the pride of a teenager earning their first paycheck at a local café or when they receive their first acceptance letter to college. You’ll miss the quiet, everyday acts of unity that make the Twin Cities stronger.
The opposite of division is connection. We invite you — we challenge you — to stop the doom-scrolling and engage with the people and communities that have been too often misrepresented in the news and on social media. Stop by Whittier Rec Center this winter on Thursdays from 5-9 p.m. to catch some fast-paced futsal or grab a coffee served up with a smile from one of our baristas. When you do, you’ll find that we all have far more in common than the headlines suggest.
At Futsal Society and Fawkes Alley Coffee, we believe in a Twin Cities where every child can play, belong and fulfill their potential. Together, we can push back against fear and division by building something better: community.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Corner-Kick-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-15 09:57:21.961342

Every day more than 5 million Californians rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), known here as CalFresh, to keep food on the table. It is our state’s largest anti-hunger program. 
Yet at the moment when food prices are rising and poverty is deepening, SNAP is facing renewed political threats that could push even more families into hunger. 
The Trump administration and its policy allies have outlined plans to significantly restrict SNAP access. They seek to revive earlier efforts to tighten work requirements for recipients, narrow eligibility and impose new administrative hurdles. 
These proposals would not simply “cut fraud,” as they are often framed. They would take food assistance away from Californians who are barely getting by. In a state where the cost of living is among the highest in the nation, the consequences would be especially severe, reversing a trend from a few years ago. 
During the pandemic, when emergency SNAP allotments were increased, food insecurity fell among the millions of low-income adults who accessed the program, national and state data show.
Nearly 3 million Californians received emergency allotments during the pandemic, but when those allotments ended, food banks across the state reported rising demand for assistance. 
That was with a federal expansion ending. Federal cuts, especially those deliberately targeting CalFresh eligibility, would be far more damaging. 
President Trump signed House Resolution One on July 4. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act alters the general work requirements to qualify for SNAP and the rules for “able-bodied adults without dependents” who receive it.
Strict work requirements will disproportionately harm people who already are working unstable, low-wage jobs. These often are retail workers with unpredictable schedules, caregivers juggling multiple responsibilities or workers whose hours fluctuate. 
Paperwork burdens and aid cuts
Research shows that such mandates do not increase employment. Instead, they create additional paperwork burdens and often result in eligible families being cut off from critical food benefits. 
Other changes hitting CalFresh recipients include Standard Utility Allowance adjustments. The allowances enable recipients to factor in standard utility costs when applying for aid.
Effective November 1, only households that include a member over the age of 60 or someone with a disability can claim such deductions for electricity, gas or water bills. That will mean a lower monthly food budget for already struggling families not meeting that criteria. 
Even modest reductions matter when grocery costs are rising.
Though CalFresh recipients are getting a small cost-of-living adjustment that will slightly raise payments, the increase is modest compared to the potential harm of expanding work requirements and reducing utility assistance.
California’s focus must remain on ensuring that these policies do not worsen hunger, especially for communities already facing systemic barriers. The state has a chance to preserve its own asset-friendly rules, maintain waivers for able-bodied adults where appropriate and advocate for policies that strengthen, rather than weaken, access to food. 
CalFresh is not a handout. It is a critical public health and equity tool. 
When families lose it, that harms children, seniors and working family members, pushing them into food insecurity and stress which, in turn, affects health, education and economic stability.  
As policymakers debate SNAP’s future, one principle should guide them: public benefits exist to protect people in crisis, not to create new obstacles. California can show the nation that smart, equitable food policy supports families, reduces hardship and builds a healthier, more resilient state.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/10302025_LA-Food-Bank-SNAP_JWH_CM_07.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-15 08:56:23.924624
,California,2025-12-15 13:05:00+00:00,CalMatters,Prison health workers are among the best-paid public employees. Why are so many jobs vacant?,Kristen Hwang,,,,,https://calmatters.org/health/2025/12/prison-health-jobs-vacant-state-audit/,"California spent hundreds of millions on prison and hospital healthcare staff, auditors found, but vacancy rates rose since 2019, exceeding 30% at three facilities despite bonuses and pay raises, with inadequate oversight and planning.","In summary
California spent hundreds of millions on prison and hospital healthcare staff, auditors found, but vacancy rates rose since 2019, exceeding 30% at three facilities despite bonuses and pay raises, with inadequate oversight and planning.


Despite spending hundreds of millions of dollars to fill vacant medical and mental health positions at prisons and state hospitals, California has little to show for it, according to a new report from the state auditor.
Job vacancy rates have increased since 2019 at the three facilities examined in the audit, as has the state’s reliance on pricey temporary workers. Atascadero State Hospital, Porterville Developmental Center and Salinas Valley State Prison had health-related vacancy rates topping 30% during fiscal year 2023-24. At Salinas Valley State Prison more than 50% of health positions were unfilled.
Workers contend that the high vacancy rate leads to more on-the-job assaults, mandatory overtime and staff turnover.
“A high vacancy rate is a self-fulfilling prophecy,” said Dr. Stuart Bussey, president of the Union of American Physicians and Dentists, which represents about 1,300 state psychiatrists.
The vacancy rates persisted despite targeted bonuses and wage increases that prison health workers received in contracts and under court order during the Newsom administration. Those included $42,000 bonuses for prison psychiatrists in a 2023 contract and more recently $20,000 bonuses the state had to dole out to mental health workers through a long-running prisoner rights lawsuit.
At face value, some state health workers are comparatively well-compensated. All of the 55 prison employees who earned more than $500,000 in income last year were doctors, dentists, psychiatrists or medical executives, according to state controller data.
A board-certified psychiatrist at Atascadero State Hospital — some of the highest paid state employees — can earn more than $397,000 in base pay. They also retire with pensions through the California Public Employees’ Retirement System. In comparison, the mean wage for a psychiatrist in California is $328,560, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
But in certain places, local hospitals are offering even more. In Monterey County, $90,000 hiring bonuses are common at private hospitals struggling to fill their own vacancies, staff told state auditors.
Despite the pay, vacancy rates were highest among psychiatrists at Atascadero State Hospital and second highest at Porterville Developmental Center and Salinas Valley State Prison, auditors found.
All three of the audited facilities house individuals who are either incarcerated or institutionalized because they were deemed by the courts to be dangerous or unfit to stand trial. Federal and state law as well as court rulings require the state to provide adequate medical and mental health care. As a result, most of the facilities are required to have vacancy rates less than 10%.
Over the past 30 years, California has consistently failed to meet that standard. 
None of the state departments overseeing the facilities have taken necessary steps to ensure adequate staffing, auditors wrote.
The audit found:

The facilities had a “significant number of vacant positions” that were not filled by temporary workers or staff overtime.
Neither the Department of State Hospitals nor the Department of Developmental Services, which houses some people with developmental disabilities in Porterville, had procedures to adequately evaluate or budget for staffing needs annually.
The state hospitals and developmental services departments as well as the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation have no process to determine whether facilities are meeting staffing minimums during each shift.

In a letter to lawmakers, California State Auditor Grant Parks wrote that the state should conduct a statewide recruitment campaign to hire health care workers “because of the decades-long difficulties the facilities have had in filling vacant health care positions and a current and projected health care professional shortage.”
In response to the audit, the developmental services and state hospitals departments partially agreed with the findings in detailed comments. 
The Department of State Hospitals, however, wrote that the vacancy rates covered during the audit period were significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and that salary savings were overstated. “Our hospitals regularly meet or exceed mandated staffing minimums and have self-reported rare occurrences where they have not due to extraordinary circumstances,” department spokesperson Ralph Montano said, in an email to CalMatters. The department has agreed to implement many of the recommendations made in the report, Montano added. 
In a statement, the corrections department said it was “committed to providing adequate health care for the incarcerated population, while ensuring fiscal responsibility.”
Workers claim state wastes money to fill vacancies
Coby Pizzotti, a lobbyist for the California Association of Psychiatric Technicians, which represents about 6,000 mental health clinicians, said the audit confirmed what many of the state worker unions had suspected: The state has continually refused to meaningfully improve wages, benefits and working conditions for employees, while spending money on temporary workers. This, the unions contend, makes the vacancy problem worse.
“Effectively, it’s a shadow state employee workforce. They’re just not called civil servants,” Pizzotti said.
The departments saved $592 million in payroll over six years by carrying the vacancies, the auditors wrote. But, auditors criticized the state departments for their inability to specifically track how they later spent that money. The departments counter that, generally, the money can be used to offset other costs or it can be given back to the state.
But they have also poured money into temporary positions to meet court-mandated minimums. During the six-year audit period, the state spent $239 million on contract workers to fill staff vacancies. The departments were authorized to spend more than $1 billion on temporary workers during that time period, though they used only a fraction of the money, according to the audit.
Contract workers, while making up less than 10% of the health care workforce, are paid so much that they cost more per hour than state workers even after accounting for benefits, auditors also found.
State workers’ unions say that’s more evidence toward their argument that these arrangements don’t save the state money.
“Contracting out is not a great way to do business. It’s expensive,” said Doug Chiappetta, executive director of the psychiatrists union.
Instead, state health worker unions want the state to increase salaries and benefits, to make permanent positions more attractive to candidates rather than spending it on highly paid contract workers. 
The psychiatric technicians union, psychiatrists union and the state nurses union said that contract workers get paid two to three times more per hour than state employees, according to job advertisements from contracting agencies they have collected. Those companies are also able to offer generous benefits and scheduling flexibility that state jobs don’t have.
“It’s been a slap to our faces to see how the state doesn’t care for our nurses,” said Vanessa Seastrong, chair of Bargaining Unit 17 for SEIU Local 1000, which represents about 5,100 registered nurses. “You’re standing next to a nurse that is doing less work than you and getting paid more than you. How does that bring up morale?”
Bigger problems for recruitment
Even relying on temporary contract workers, the state has in many cases still failed to maintain staffing minimums for health care positions. 
Vacancy rates increased significantly between 2019 and 2024. Salinas Valley State Prison saw vacancies jump 62% during the audit period, and more than half of mental health and medical positions were unfilled during fiscal year 2023-24. 
Atascadero State Hospital’s vacancy rate rose 39% over the audit period for a total vacancy rate of about 30%. During the last three years of the audit period, Atascadero also lost 90% of its staff to attrition.
Porterville Developmental Center’s vacancy rate increased by just 6% over the audit period, but more than a third of its positions remained unfilled in the final year of the audit.
In interviews with auditors, administrators at the facilities said that the COVID-19 pandemic caused higher staff turnover as well as an increased reliance on contract workers to fill gaps.
All three facilities, which are located along the Central Coast or in the Central Valley, face additional barriers to recruitment. 
These areas suffer from health care professional shortages. The area along the coast where Atascadero State Hospital and Salinas Valley State Prison are located faces a medium shortage of behavioral health workers, while Porterville Developmental Center is in an area with a severe shortage, according to the Department of Health Care Access and Information.
“Places like the Central Valley have substantially fewer mental health professionals per population than compared to the rest of the state,” said Janet Coffman, a professor at UCSF’s Institute for Health Policy Studies who studies workforce issues. “Particularly for Porterville, that’s a big part of the issue.”
At the same time, demand for mental health services has increased in the general population, Coffman said.
Combined, that makes it more difficult for the state to compete with the private sector, which is also struggling to hire health care workers. 
Other barriers are difficult to address with money alone. The patient population can make the work dangerous. Staff are frequently verbally or physically assaulted. Unsafe conditions make it harder to recruit new workers and sometimes cause long-time workers to retire early. 
“There were 2,700 assaults on staff last year. It’s not a matter of if, it’s when,” Pizzoti said.
The audit recommended that the state conduct a market analysis of all health care positions to determine whether payment was competitive, streamline the hiring process, and conduct a statewide recruitment campaign.

(Getty Images)An Alabama Reflector analysis of executions in the state over the past decade shows five of the state’s 67 counties account for almost half of the total number of death sentences imposed since 2012.
The five counties have a population of about 1.7 million people, comprising roughly a third of the state’s total population.
In all, about 23 counties have sentenced at least one person to death since 2012.

Mobile County had the highest number of death sentences imposed with nine, followed by Madison County with four. Morgan, Jefferson, St. Clair and Calhoun counties each sentenced three people to death.
Russell, Marshall, Escambia and Colbert each had two people who were sentenced to death during that time. Another 13 counties all have one individual sentenced to death.

According to the Reflector’s analysis, Ashley Rich, Mobile County’s district attorney from 2010 to 2023, oversaw eight death sentences.
“There is a lot of different variables that we look at,” Rich said in an interview. “We do not take it lightly at all. If you are asking a jury to hand down a sentence of death, then it is reserved and held for the worst of the worst.”
Robert Broussard, Madison County’s DA, has overseen four. Combined, Rich and Broussard account for a quarter of the death sentences in the state since 2012.
“For the most part, it is up to the individual district attorney whether or not you are seeking the death penalty,” Broussard said in an interview. “Of course I am the boss, I am the one who gets the final say on it, but I am saying is, when a case of a certain magnitude comes up, there is very much a discussion on the case as to whether we believe, ultimately I believe, the death penalty is warranted.”
Experts say cities and more populated areas will see more death sentences because of the resources needed to pursue capital trials. Such trials last longer and require more resources.
“The number one reason why, when you are looking at Texas, you see Harris County, Dallas County, Tarrant County, leading the pack is because those are the biggest counties,” said Jeffrey Newberry, legal clinical supervisor at the University of Houston Law Center. “It is not just because they have the higher populations, it is because they have the bigger district attorneys’ offices and built within them the structure to have these capital trials.”
The largest Alabama counties that have not imposed death sentences since 2012 are Baldwin County in south Alabama (population 261,000) and Montgomery County (population 226,000).
The Alabama Reflector obtained data collected by the Death Penalty Information Center on death sentences dating back more than a decade. The information included the state, county and the year they were sentenced, as well as demographic information such as the person’s ethnicity, gender and, for some years, the race and gender of the victims.
The data was then compiled into a spreadsheet and then analyzed to gauge where and when the death sentences were imposed since 2012.

A decline in death sentences

The use of capital punishment has steadily declined in the United States since its peak in 1996, when 315 death sentences were imposed. That number had fallen to 26 by 2024. Alabama’s yearly death sentences have also declined, from a peak of 25 in 1998 to four in 2024.
But capital punishment remains a defining feature of Alabama’s criminal justice system. Since 2012, the state has sentenced 46 people to death, the fourth highest total in the dataset.
California has sentenced 111 people to death since 2012. But the state has not conducted an execution since 2006. California Gov. Gavin Newsom imposed a moratorium on the use of the death penalty in 2019.
Florida is the state with the next highest total, 102, followed by Texas with 66, then Alabama, then the rust belt state of Ohio with 29. All four states have conducted executions since 2012, though capital punishment is informally suspended in Ohio.
This concentrated application of the death penalty is a pattern that repeats throughout every state that allows for capital punishment. In California, for example, Riverside and Los Angeles counties alone account for almost 60% of the total number of instances that the death penalty was imposed. If the top five counties are included in the analysis, it increases to more than 80%.
In Florida, the state with the second highest total, the top five counties covered about a third of all the death sentences since 2012. In Texas, the top five counties, including Harris County, which contains Houston, comprise almost 44% of the total death sentences. In Ohio, it is 55%.
“There are certain hotspots, but they are not particularly the same areas where there is a lot of crime,” said Frank R. Baumgartner, a professor of political science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who researches the use of capital punishment. “Also, Baltimore city doesn’t impose the death penalty very much, but Baltimore County, the surrounding suburb does. It is just a strange, arbitrary and capricious system.”
Nearly all the counties in Alabama that have sentenced more than one person to death are majority white. Mobile County has a population that is 56% white.  Madison County has a population that is almost two-thirds white. Other counties that have executed three people are St. Clair that has a white population of 85%, Morgan County is 75% white and Calhoun County is 71% white.
The two exceptions are Jefferson and Russell counties, which are 49% and 44% white, respectively.
Local prosecutors also play a major role in death sentences.
“There are a handful of prosecutors that are truly the deadliest prosecutors,” said Corinna Barrett Lain, a law professor at the University of Richmond and author of the book, “Secrets of the Killing State: The Untold Story of Lethal Injection.” “If you are asking what distinguishes these counties from neighboring counties where you are not seeing the death penalty, the biggest factor is a handful of especially deadly prosecutors.”
No single model is prescribed for district attorneys. All have different standards and processes when seeking the death penalty.
According to Alabama statute, people are eligible to be sentenced to death if they commit murder on top of an aggravating offense. State statute lists out the 19 offenses, which include kidnapping or robbery in the first degree. A person is also eligible for the death penalty in the death of a law enforcement officer, when killing at least two people or if the victim is younger than 14 years old.
Other factors that make someone eligible for the death penalty include firing a weapon into a building or vehicle and killing a person, or when the victim was issued a protective order by the court.
Absent that, the decision rests with each of the respective district attorneys about how to move forward, and each office uses its own heuristics when deciding. For Rich, she weighs the gruesome nature of the offense.

Rich and Broussard said in separate interviews that they weigh the circumstances of each case in seeking the death penalty.
Rich said she weighs each case on its circumstances. She cited Derrick Dearman, who was executed in 2024 for his role in five murders in 2018. One of the victims was a pregnant woman. Rich also cited John DeBlase and Heather Keaton, sentenced to death for killing their two children in 2010.
“Clearly, those cases were exceptional cases,” Rich said. “They were especially horrific, gruesome, and they were deserving of the death penalty. That is the common thread; they were especially gruesome.”
Broussard said he thinks carefully about whether he should pursue the death penalty, particularly whether a murder was “especially heinous, atrocious or cruel.”
“If you are in the area where it is a close call, our approach would really be that we don’t seek the death penalty,” Broussard said. “I will be the first to admit, we are, what I consider, a hardline office of law and order and justice. If it was some close call with us, I would think that would translate to the public as being something that the public would probably not be inclined to see as a death penalty case.”
Broussard cited details from two cases that his office was able to secure a death sentence. Warren Hardy was convicted in 2022 of shooting and killing a woman when he tried to steal her vehicle after abducting his estranged girlfriend’s daughter and stepfather who both escaped during the incident.
“He runs to a stranger’s house, the neighbors, and there is a middle-aged woman with a tray of hors d’oeuvres because she is going to a neighborhood party,” Broussard said. “She is at the front door, and he pulls out a pistol and shoots her point blank. Her husband is inside the door, and she goes down with her party tray and has nothing to do with anything. Then dies a slow, painful death from the gunshot wound.”
One of Hardy’s attorneys, John Brinkley, disagreed.
“Capital cases in Alabama consider aggravated circumstances. Here, there was nothing heinous, extraordinary or gruesome about this event,” he said in an interview. “It is always terribly unfortunate for those who were within the zone of danger, at risk or lost a loved one but this case was very unremarkable in comparison to homicide prosecutions.
Broussard also cited Lionel Francis, who was convicted and sentenced to death in 2019 for his role in the shooting death of his 20-month-old daughter. Francis said the shooting was an accident, but according to court documents, the medical examiner said the evidence was consistent with someone shooting the victim while the gun was in contact with the forehead.
Messages were left with Francis’ attorney seeking comment.
A state appeals court later overturned the death sentence, ruling the lower court failed to prove an aggravating factor beyond a reasonable doubt that made Francis eligible for the death penalty.
He was resentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.
Critics argue that nearly all cases that involve murder have one element that can be considered cruel, unusual or heinous.
“There was actually a challenge under Arizona law where a study was done, and 98% of all first-degree murders qualified as capital murder,” Lain said.
With that standard in place, a death sentence is then left to the individual district attorneys, which some consider arbitrary; the standard in one jurisdiction will be different in others.
“If you want to argue that it is arbitrary, you can argue that it is arbitrary in different jurisdictions, comparing one jurisdiction to another, I will not argue with you then,” Broussard said. “It may be random if you commit a certain murder, and you happen to be in X jurisdiction, and that exact murder in Y jurisdiction is viewed differently, I will not argue that.”
Rich said that district attorneys are trusted to make that judgement.
“That is the reason people elect district attorneys,” she said. “They trust the person they elect to make that decision, and I was elected by the people of Mobile County to take a firm stance prosecuting capital murder cases.”
Broussard said it is not arbitrary in the same county, particularly in his jurisdiction.
“I guarantee you that I can point to the circumstance of it that makes it fundamentally different from cases we don’t seek the death penalty on,” Broussard said. “We don’t take it lightly. It is not some badge of honor to rack up death penalties.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Gas-mask-for-Dec-9-2024-story-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-15 08:56:23.924624

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)After President Donald Trump signed a much anticipated and controversial executive order aiming to preempt states from governing artificial intelligence, Utah leaders have some concerns, but ultimately they say it won’t stop them from trying to regulate the technology, especially in children’s hands. 
The Republican-controlled Utah Legislature and Gov. Spencer Cox have shared mixed thoughts on both social media and AI, encouraging energy expansion to accommodate the data centers that sustain them, but also deeply criticizing their role in people’s mental health. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
They have championed legislation reining in deepfakes and chatbots used for mental health or legal advice. They also have plans for more next legislative session. And, earlier this month Cox said he’d defend the states’ ability to act to address digital issues.    
Herriman Republican Rep. Doug Fiefia, who co-chairs a national task force on state AI policy, described the order as “an overreaching act that fundamentally disregards the Tenth Amendment and the necessary role of the States in technology governance.”
While he supports the idea of a national framework, he said in a statement that the standard must be developed through a proper legislative process in Congress that ensures full debate and transparency, “not through unilateral action that threatens state funding with no federal standard to replace it with.”
“States must retain their authority as ‘laboratories of democracy.’ Because AI is evolving so quickly, States are closer to the ground and uniquely positioned to adjust quickly and develop tailored regulations,” he said. “Bypassing Congress undermines policy stability and dangerously ignores the need for critical state guardrails.”
Trump signs order intended to block states from regulating AI

Only a law passed in Congress can guarantee that the framework aligns with all states’ needs, he said. 
However, Senate Majority Leader Kirk Cullimore, R-Sandy, said the order shouldn’t interfere with Utah’s future plans to regulate AI. 
“I think he’s looking more at California, Colorado, New York, who are looking to regulate the models of AI, which can stifle the entrepreneurship, stifle the innovation,” Cullimore said. “And, they’re imposing values that don’t necessarily represent all Americans on these regulations, on the baseline models of AI.” 
He referred to examples like one cited in the order that bans “algorithmic discrimination” on so-called high-risk AI systems in Colorado. 
However, Cullimore believes the order will still allow Utah lawmakers to continue on their quest to make AI safer for consumers, giving states space to regulate the use of AI as it interfaces with citizens. 
The order creates a task force to review and challenge state laws in court. According to the text, its goal is to ensure a national standard on AI. 
It also calls for a federal department to make legislative recommendations that don’t preempt states on AI law relating to child safety protection, data center infrastructure, state government procurement and use of AI, among others that will be determined in the future.
“I have some concerns, but that seriously decreases my concerns,” Cullimore said.



Let us know what you think...


 


Still, Cullimore worries about executive orders acting as legislation, something he described as “not proper” for any administration.
He also worries about the states’ ability to regulate the interface between business and consumers, a topic that states have traditionally managed. 
For example, in Utah, Cullimore said, companies have developed therapy chatbots that have been studied at an AI learning lab for future policy recommendations in the state.
“So it’s actually encouraging people to use AI and to develop it because they have the confidence that they’re operating within appropriate boundaries with state law,” he said. “And so I think there are appropriate ways that states should and could regulate the uses of AI, and that will actually encourage innovation and encourage entrepreneurship.”
Cox’s office did not reply to a request for comment Friday. However, before Trump signed the order Thursday evening, Cox said on a social media post that “an alternative AI executive order focused on human flourishing would strike the balance we need: safeguard our kids, preserve our values, and strengthen American competitiveness. States must help protect children and families while America accelerates its leadership in AI.”

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)More than 20 years ago, the journal of the Child Welfare League of America devoted an entire issue to the problem of children removed to foster care or trapped there because their families didn’t have adequate housing. The issue noted that three separate studies found that at least 30% of foster children could be home right now if their families had adequate housing.
A fourth was even more disturbing. If found that child protective caseworkers were, to use one of their own favorite phrases, in denial, concerning the extent of the problem. The study found that workers “may tend to ignore housing as a problem rather than deal with the cognitive dissonance caused by the recognition that they cannot help their clients with this important need.”
Perhaps that’s why, in the Current’s stories on this issue, while I read comment after comment about how it might be a “filthy house” that may lack heat or air conditioning and may have “toddlers crawling around the floor,” never once was such a comment followed by “so we sent in a cleaning crew” or, “so we bought them an air conditioner.” After all, what would be the point if the “real” problem is mental illness or substance abuse?
In fact, odds are the “real” problem is housing, or can be fixed by starting with housing.
Understanding that is vital to children’s well-being; it might even save their lives – because of what we know of the grim reality of foster care.
Study after study finds that in typical cases – which are nothing like the horror stories – children left in their own homes fare better even than comparably-maltreated children placed in foster care. The most recent and most alarming such study comes from Sweden. That study found that, by age 20, the foster children were more than four times more likely to have died, most often by suicide.
Another set of studies finds abuse in one-quarter to one-third of family foster homes, and the rate of abuse in group homes and institutions is even worse. So it’s obscene to take away a child because their home lacks air conditioning, only to put her or him at such high risk.
All of it is likely worse in Nevada, which tears apart families at a rate well over 40% above the national average, even when rates of child poverty are factored in.
How do we know the “real” problem is housing?
For starters, contrary to the common stereotype the overwhelming majority of the unhoused – 78% or more – are not, in fact, mentally ill.  Similarly, 82% do not have a problem with substance abuse.
Where these really are issues, some Nevada officials confuse cause and effect.  As Ann Braden Johnson wrote her book, Out of Bedlam, “homelessness itself is a state of such unremitting crisis that one would expect it to provoke some kind of emotional or mental disorder, in and of itself.” Or, put more bluntly, “being homeless could drive you crazy.”
As the former head of Missouri’s child welfare agency, Darrell Missey said:
“We know that addiction and mental illness occur in affluent communities just like they do in poorer neighborhoods, but rates of removal among the poor are astronomically higher. If the deprivations of poverty are addressed, people can often address these other problems and keep their families intact.
The double standard is illustrated in microcosm when you consider that affluent “cannamoms” who smoke pot during their children’s playdates can be celebrated in magazine cover stories, but a poor person can be kicked out of a shelter if her partner brings in a marijuana vape pen.
It’s ludicrous to try to fix the “other problems” first and only then address the housing. As one lawyer explained:
“[Y]ou can’t really focus on mental health treatment or substance abuse treatment or education or anything else because your energy is tied up in fundamental basic survival needs.”
Research supports a housing first approach.
One study found that when homeless families simply received housing vouchers, the rate at which they lost children to foster care was cut by half.  The very fact that Clark County officials claim family shelters have prevented 1,838 children from being thrown into foster care further illustrates the need to focus on housing first.
But that won’t happen until the people who run child welfare systems in Nevada no longer are in denial.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/plushanimals-1024x680.jpg,,,2025-12-15 08:56:23.924624

(Photo: Brandon Bell/Getty Images)Nevada lawmakers took significant steps to strengthen the state’s gun laws following the  1 October mass shooting in Las Vegas in 2017, but further legislative progress has eluded the state ever since.
The Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence last week released its annual scorecard of state legislation and graded Nevada a B- for the strength of its gun laws. The Silver State has earned the same grade for the past three years.
Eighteen states have stronger gun laws, according to Giffords.
Overall, Giffords found that states with stronger gun laws have lower gun death rates. According to the organization, Nevada’s rate of gun deaths increased 24% between 2014 and 2023. That’s slower than the national increase, which was 33%.
Nevada ranks 15th for its gun death rate, 17.7 per 100,000. According to Giffords, 68% of those deaths are suicide and 29% are homicides.
The organization praised Nevada for banning bump stocks and ghost guns, requiring universal background checks, and passing laws to prevent child access. But it believes the state should also restrict assault weapons and large capacity magazines, institute waiting periods, and reform open carry regulations.
Several gun laws recommended by Giffords were implemented in Nevada in the two legislative sessions following the 2017 mass shooting on the Las Vegas Strip, which remains the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. At that time, Democrats controlled both chambers of the state Legislature and the governorship.
Democrats lost that trifecta in 2022 with the unseating of Gov. Steve Sisolak.
His successor, Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo has vetoed several gun control proposals since taking office. That includes bills that would have raised the age of possessing semi-automatic firearms from 18 to 21 and prohibited the possession of firearms within 100 feet of an election site. 
State Sen. Edgar Flores (D-Las Vegas) this year sponsored a bill to create a gun violence prevention office. The bill was amended to create a special counsel position within the attorney general’s office that would advise the AG and collaborate with researchers on matters related to gun violence.
Lombardo vetoed the bill, writing in his veto letter that the bill runs the risk of “turning a public safety initiative into a political tool” because the attorney general is a partisan office.
That sentiment echoed most opposition from Republicans in the Legislature. Only one, Assemblymember Melissa Hardy (R-Henderson), voted for the bill.
State Sen. Carrie Buck (R-Henderson) in a floor speech before voting against the bill called it “ideological advocacy dressed up as neutral policy” and a “veiled attempt at ideological overreach.”
State Sen. Melanie Schieble (D-Las Vegas), in her own remarks, responded by saying “the real veiled attempt here is the attempt to look like we care about the people of Nevada.”
“It does not set the policy,” she said of the bill. “It sets the priority. It sends the message. It gives us the infrastructure, the platform, the opportunity to have robust and meaningful conversations about implementing programs and policies that actually prevent gun violence.”
She criticized her Republican colleagues, saying they refused to work with Democrats on the issue.
“Not even the smallest measure to create an office that has conversations about preventing gun violence,” said Schieble. “If we’re not willing to do that, then we’re literally not willing to do anything — anything — to prevent gun violence.”
Flores said it was Republican and Democratic student groups at UNLV that asked him to carry the bill following the on-campus shooting in December 2023 that killed three faculty members and left a fourth severely injured. Opposing the bill, he told his Senate colleagues on the floor, is pretending to be doing something while really doing nothing.
It’s “going home with the same exact ending” and doing “absolutely nothing to address a conversation that these kids are demanding we have because they feel we are inadequately addressing these concerns,”  he said.
The Giffords 2025 scorecard was released on Tuesday, Dec. 9 — a few days after the two-year anniversary of that UNLV shooting. Giffords is led by former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona, who in 2011 survived a gunshot wound to the head in an attempted assination.
The organization in its report noted that Nevada this year made positive changes to its  existing victims of crime program, which provides financial assistance to victims (or their dependents) for lost wages, counseling, medical expenses, or funeral expenses. Although such legislation isn’t factored into the Giffords scorecard rankings, they are seen as  beneficial to victims of gun violence.
Assemblymember Erica Roth (D-Reno) sponsored the legislation to extend application deadlines for victims and broaden the type of evidence needed to prove eligibility. Separate legislation expanded the types of victims eligible for compensation.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/youth-gun-deaths.jpg,,,2025-12-15 08:56:23.924624

I don’t know if Rev. James Coyle — killed in Birmingham in 1921 for officiating an interracial marriage — is in that social studies textbook. If he were, we might have a future where adults in this state don’t feel comfortable threatening people based on their religion.
But I know the sort of juvenile history our leaders would prefer our children learn: one where a mostly white America triumphantly marches through the wilderness and then the world. With God watching down and smiling the whole time.
Which is not how it played out, of course. Our history has a huge cast and a lot of cruelty and suffering. Alabama has been an authoritarian state longer than it’s been a democracy, if it ever was. And it’s important to understand that if you want to make a better future.
None of this should be controversial. But we’ve let a campaign-ad patriotism seep into public life and become the default definition of the word. “Patriotism” really doesn’t describe this attitude. It’s more like chauvinism: a blind belief in the self-evident greatness of our country. One that cannot fathom that Americans ever made anyone suffer, or that any American ever suffered unjustly.
A few weeks ago, New York Times columnist David Brooks wrote about a poll that found a significant partisan divide between Democrats and Republicans on pride in the country. Republicans, it seems, are unquestioningly proud of their country; Democrats are not. Brooks, no fan of the current regime, lamented this development, and wrote that his pride in his country is unconditional.
Here, though, I think we need to distinguish pride in one’s country from love of it.
I love this country. But my conception of that love is patience. Just as one accepts a person one cares about in full. You know their strengths and weaknesses. And you believe the former can outweigh and remedy the latter.
But love does not mean ignoring a person’s shortcomings. Or smiling and nodding when they do something wrong. Or pretending a loved one acting shamefully is a person to be proud of.
History is how we understand that. You don’t have to take pride in this nation’s enslavement and marginalization of Black Americans. Or its long war on Indigenous people. Or its endless efforts to treat women of all backgrounds as children.
I’m pretty ashamed of a state where our leaders weep mighty tears for religious freedom while treating Alabamians of the Islamic faith as threats. Where the state’s senior U.S. senator feels perfectly comfortable calling for the mass deportation of people based on their religion, a direct attack on this nation’s tradition of religious tolerance, which Americans can be proud of. That it’s predictable doesn’t make it any less disgusting or hypocritical.
If you love your country — if you love your state — you can be ashamed of that. Because your fellow Americans deserve better. Because you deserve better.
But we’re supposed to indulge in a patriotism that considers the nation infallible and its critics heretics. One that hauls down the flag that flies over us and hangs it as a curtain, dividing Americans into arbitrary degrees of Americanness. I’m tired of that.
We have people we can be proud of in this country. We have many examples of them in Alabama. Like Rosa Parks. And E.D. Nixon. We have plenty of stories of individual courage and heroism in the service of our ideals
But you have to remember what they had to face. And if you treat the crimes or sins of the past as easily ignored aberrations, you will guarantee that they happen again, and prevent us from becoming what we could be. As we have seen in Hoover.
The state school board has delayed the vote on the new social studies textbooks to next year. Maybe then we will hear more about what these members object to. I have to assume they’re not worried about a glut of triumphant descriptions of our country.
But I hope for our children’s sake we can start embracing history that reflects what the country is and not the blinkered visions of a few powerful people.

(Leah Romero for Source New Mexico)A new documentary from Las Cruces filmmaker Annie Ersinhaus tells the story of the oil and gas industry’s takeover of the Permian and San Juan basins, and the effects fracking over the last decade has had on area communities.
Ersinghaus, 24, grew up in Las Cruces and attended New Mexico State University where she studied filmmaking. Her previous films cover the emotions that come with the release of water in the Rio Grande each summer, water usage in the southwest and other subjects.
Ersinghaus released “The Land of Sacrifice: The Burden of New Mexico’s Oil and Gas Extraction” this fall, melding visuals from oil wells near Carlsbad and Farmington and commentary from residents, environmental advocates and other climate and health experts. Several of the people highlighted in the film also represent New Mexico Land, Air, Water, and the Sacred (NMLAWS), a collective of various organizations and advocates working to hold the state accountable “to its constitutional duty to protect all New Mexicans from oil and gas pollution.” 
NMLAWS organizations are also plaintiffs in the Atencio v. State of New Mexico lawsuit, filed in May 2023, which claims the state is violating the rights of New Mexico residents for a “healthful” environment and protection of natural resources from “oil and gas pollution.” The case was dismissed on appeal, but plaintiffs appealed to the New Mexico Supreme Court. On Nov. 10, the state’s highest court agreed to hear the case. 
The film also points to the upcoming legislative session in January 2026 as an opportunity to pass legislation that would limit oil and gas production near schools. Such proposed legislation failed during previous sessions.
“This documentary is a stark portrait of the price New Mexico communities pay while the fracking industry cashes in,” Gail Evans, an attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity and who is highlighted in the film, said in a written statement. The Center for Biological Diversity represents NMLAWS in the Atencio lawsuit. “The film makes a strong case for why we need urgent action.”
Source New Mexico spoke with Ersinghaus this week about her film. The following interview was edited for clarity and concision.
 
Source NM: What drew you to documentary filmmaking?
Annie Ersinghaus: I always had fun summers running around, jumping in ditches or going on little adventures, and just always loved the beauty of the sunset. And I wanted to capture those moments and show people the fun we had, and the adventures and capture that feeling. 
Why did you decide to take on environmental subjects in your films?
Initially it was like showing the beauty of everything. And I think with that, I came to understand my relationship with the environment some more and be like, ‘Wow, being outside is something that keeps me sane, literally.’ I love it so much. I love the sunsets, I love where I’m from. And then I realized, as I got older…damage is happening here and there, or what we’re doing to our environment, or to the river. 
I’d love to jump in the ditches in the summer and the water here was like summertime.  And I remember back growing up, the water used to be here for longer. And I was like, ‘Wait a second. Why did that change?’… It’s like my passion and being here kind of spurred moments of thinking, I guess, and then drawing me closer to nature. And then in that way, finding that so important, finding protecting it so important. 
Why take on oil and gas as a film subject, and why now?
NMLAWS came down to Las Cruces to the Rio Grande Theater [last March] and they had a panel. I went with my dad and I remember being maybe one of the youngest people in that room, and hearing stories from people like Jozee [Zuniga, a community organizer] and the lawyers from NMLAWS, just sort of introducing this issue. And Jozee, talking about her home and her backyard and stuff, and I just immediately thought of mine. And I was like, ‘If this was happening in my backyard, I wouldn’t stand for this, none of my neighbors would stand for this. But this is actively happening to people.’ This was a moment of learning. I didn’t even know our state was that big of a producer at all. I didn’t know a lot of what they presented and I was like, ‘What can I do about this?’ 
And then I got the [New Mexico Documentary Incubator Grant]. I wanted to tell a story that would let people like me, from areas like Las Cruces that don’t have a lot of production, understand what’s actually happening in New Mexico, and then it kind of makes you think about other states.
Native activists protest more oil and gas drilling in the Greater Chaco landscape

How have audiences received the film so far?
I think a lot of what I felt is what people were feeling, too — anger and kind of sadness, and anger and sadness when they’re together is really hard…It’s a weird mix of emotions that you can’t quite separate. In all of these places, we had a panel so you could talk to Gail [Evans] or Jozee. And so that was a really cool opportunity to actually have a conversation with the audience members. Especially here in Cruces, I think it was really important because we don’t know about oil and gas production here. In Gallup and Farmington, it’s more familiar in those communities. But here, a lot of those people were, ‘What can we do?’ 
You can’t fix something if you don’t know what’s happening, and I think that was the main thing here. A lot of people just have zero idea and I think even just that bare minimum of conversations with other folks and learning is beneficial.
More and more community members, I think, are seeing the damage to their environment and the climate and to their health and local communities, and I think more of them are coming together. And then people like us can support them anywhere. I think there’s hope in community conversations that are happening more often, for sure. 
What else do you want people to know about this issue facing the state?
I think in the greater sense: Air does not follow borders. What’s happening in New Mexico is affecting Texas, what’s happening in Texas is affecting here and the whole U.S. and then the whole world.  And I think that’s a big thing and that’s why awareness is important no matter where you are.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ersinghaus1-1024x683.png,,,2025-12-15 08:56:23.924624
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-15 12:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,What to know about the CT Mirror/ProPublica towing investigation,Dave Altimari,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/15/ct-mirror-propublica-towing-investigation-explainer/,Here’s what to know about what the CT Mirror and ProPublica investigation uncovered and how Connecticut officials responded.,"Over the past year and a half the Connecticut Mirror and ProPublica have written many stories about the state’s century-old towing laws that allowed tow truck companies to seek permission to sell people’s vehicles only 15 days after seizing them.
The stories highlighted how some towing companies were removing cars from parking lots of apartment buildings if their owners failed to back into a parking space or didn’t properly display their parking sticker. Some used portable scanners to check if cars were legally registered and towed them if they were not.
The people most impacted by these tactics were low-income families who needed their vehicles to get to their jobs and couldn’t pay hundreds of dollars to get their cars back, especially since many towing companies would only accept cash payments. 
The legislature acted quickly to revamp the towing statutes, while at the same time establishing a working group that will meet twice more before submitting a final report by Feb. 1.
Here’s what to know about what the CT Mirror and ProPublica investigation uncovered and how Connecticut officials responded.
What did the CT Mirror/ProPublica investigation of towing practices uncover? 
Some companies did not  allow people to get belongings out of their vehicles, such as work tools or valuable paperwork. Towing companies were also supposed to put any profits from the sale of the vehicles in escrow. If the owner of the vehicle didn’t claim it, companies were required by law to hand over the money, or escheat it, to the state treasurer. But that had never been done because the state Department of Motor Vehicles never established an escheating system.
Under the law, a tow truck company would submit an H-100 form to the DMV and, if the company valued the car at less than $1,500, they could get permission after 15 days to sell it privately. If a car was valued at more than $1,500, they would have to wait 45 days to sell it and only at a public auction.
Our analysis of about 6,000 forms revealed about 60% were requests for permission to sell vehicles after 15 days. There were 362 instances in which towing companies estimated the car’s value to be exactly $1,500.
Owners of towing companies said during legislative hearings that were held following the news organization’s reporting that many cars they towed were junk. But the analysis showed that towers sought permission to sell at least 150 vehicles, including nearly 40 BMWs and 20 Mercedes,  they estimated were worth less than a third of their book value despite the vehicles having no accident record in the state’s crash database.
The reporting also found that  DMV employee Dominik Stefanski made a deal with a Berlin-based tow truck company. He allowed them to cut the long lines at DMV headquarters in Wethersfield in exchange for picking out cars from their lot that he wanted to buy. In all, D&L Auto Body & Towing sold 15 vehicles to an investment firm owned by Stefanski, who then sold them at a profit.
Stefanski was placed on paid administrative leave a few days after the CT Mirror and ProPublica story was published.
How did the towing laws change?
Tow companies must now accept credit cards and aren’t allowed to tow vehicles from apartment complexes immediately just because of an expired parking permit or registration. Vehicles now can’t be towed from private property without notice unless they’re blocking traffic, fire hydrants or parked in an accessible spot.
Under the new law, towing companies can still start the sales process for vehicles worth $1,500 or less after 15 days, but they now have to take more steps to give the owner a chance to claim the vehicle. The actual sale can’t go through until 30 days after the tow, giving vehicle owners more opportunity to get their cars back.
The new law went into effect on Oct. 1.
What is the working group doing?
The group has met three times and plans two more meetings before the February deadline to submit a report to the legislature.
At the October meeting of the working group, tow company owners clashed with consumer advocates. Owners argued they need to recoup the costs of towing and storing vehicles, while consumer advocates argued for maximizing the chances that people who want their vehicles back can retrieve them.
At the group’s last meeting in November, DMV Commissioner Tony Guerrera proposed a new process — different from what legislators approved — that he called a compromise between tow companies and consumer advocates.
Under the commissioner’s new system, companies wouldn’t assign values to the vehicles they tow and sell like they do now. Further, the sales process would begin for all vehicles after 30 days and private auctions would be prohibited. 
Guerrera said this would eliminate having to estimate vehicle values while still giving consumers more time to recoup their vehicles.
What happened to the DMV employee who purchased towed cars?
In late November, Stefanski was fired by the DMV — nearly five years after investigators found he used his position to garner steep discounts on cars he bought from a towing company, according to the termination letter.
In 2020, DMV investigators recommended that Stefanski be criminally charged for the scheme they alleged made him thousands of dollars. They completed an arrest warrant but a  prosecutor decided not to file charges, citing “prosecutorial discretion.”
The prosecutor suggested the DMV could handle the matter internally. But the DMV did not discipline Stefanski or issue fines against D&L in the years after the investigation and only acted after the story ran.
The Nov. 6 termination letter notes that Stefanski, who made $72,000 annually, was fired for misconduct “when you used your position for financial gain.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025_0908_SR_TowingMeetingDMV_039-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-15 07:57:19.153251

(Getty Images)A committee told the Alabama State Department of Education (ALSDE) Thursday that they had identified “the most burdensome paperwork tasks” for teachers.
The Teacher Paperwork Streamlining Committee is a 22-member committee that works to identify “practical ways to reduce unnecessary paperwork and streamline processes for educators across Alabama.”
“Nobody wants teachers to have to do more paperwork. But then we have to figure out, you know, well, where is this coming from, and which things are legacy that maybe nobody is looking at anymore, and which things are required by either federal or state law,” Alabama State Schools Superintendent Eric Mackey said during the Dec. 11 work session.

SB 280, sponsored by Sen. Arthur Orr, R-Decatur, and passed by the Legislature last year, requires ALSDE to develop a digital platform and data sharing system that consolidates documentation required under the Alabama Literacy Act, the Alabama Numeracy Act, and other laws or policies in a way that can streamline paperwork in a manner compliant with education programs. 
The committee defined paperwork as both electronic and physical copy non-instructional requirements made of teachers.
“Technology doesn’t make everything faster, necessarily. So we want to include all of that in our discussions,” Jeff Norris, Office of Extended Learning Specialist and Streamlining Paperwork Committee member, said to State Board of Education members.
The committee conducted a survey of over 650 educators and found that teachers are spending 80% of their time completing lesson plans and 78% of their time documenting meetings. Both categories had a lower perceived effect on student achievement at 62% and 48% respectively.
Streamlining Paperwork Committee Chair Heather Hurt told the board members that teachers generally did not have a problem with lesson plan paperwork.
“You can’t just show up and have a good lesson. That’s not the problem. It’s the long form written like you’re in a teacher preparation program. That is what people were very vocal about having a problem with,” she said.
Meeting documentation includes Individualized Education Programs (IEP), created for students in special education classes and other related services to help improve educational results. It also includes grade level meetings.
“Our teachers work hard. They want to work hard, and they do work hard, and it pays off when their student achievement is attached with the paperwork,” Hurt said. “But as we know, time is our most valuable commodity, especially in a classroom.
The survey also found that educators are doing redundant paperwork including duplicating information for lesson plans.
“Attendance is tracked in PowerSchool, gradebook, and paper copy — three times for the same data,” one survey response said.
Mackey reminded board members that the sample for the survey responses is small in comparison to the 100,000 employees the state has.
“It doesn’t mean we don’t need to identify them and deal with them, but I want us to be careful we don’t panic and think that some things are happening everywhere when it literally might be one of our 1,600 schools where this is happening, which is the reason the committee is not it’s not a one off,” Mackey said to the board members.
Mackey said  it was “news to me” that teachers were completing redundant paperwork.
“If you had asked me at the table here, does anybody still require paper grade books in addition to the power school attendance, I would have said, I’m sure there’s not. But there are,” Mackey said. “This is why their work’s really good, because we’re finding out what these layers are.”
District 8 Board Member Wayne Reid said during the meeting that he liked to hear the complaints from the teachers.
“I like the ones that complain the most because they’re the ones who probably speak for more people,” he said. “There are an equal number of people who have complaints but say they don’t want to get their name out there.”
Hurt said some of the next things the committee will do is create a template for the ALSDE to define paperwork and determine if it’s coming from the state, federal or local bodies and look into other types of paperwork including lesson plans, meeting documentation and parent communication to provide guidance for teachers.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Classroom-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-12-15 07:57:19.153251

(Washington State Department of Transportation)Declining gas tax revenue and skyrocketing construction costs have plagued Washington state’s transportation budget for years. 
Those twin forces had left budget writers searching for options to fill a growing long-term shortfall. Without a solution, they warned of major road projects going unfinished. 
To deal with this, lawmakers this year passed a slew of new and increased taxes and fees, including a rare increase in the state’s gas tax that will continue to rise alongside inflation. 
Another big piece of their solution is to transfer a sliver of sales tax revenue that usually goes toward state operations to transportation efforts. 
The switcheroo, accounting for 0.1% of the state’s 6.5% sales tax rate, is expected to raise about $300 million annually, a figure that is predicted to increase each year. It starts in the next biennium, so doesn’t affect the current budget, which runs through mid-2027. 
In exchange, the transportation fund is moving money in the near-term toward the general fund, which accounts for most state spending. 
The thinking is to help shore up the general fund now, while strengthening the transportation budget in future years.
Washington’s three budgets — operating, transportation and capital — technically need to be balanced across four years. 
Lawmakers are now looking at another shortfall in the operating budget next year and will need to turn to cuts or revenue to balance the state’s finances. In doing so, they could renege on the sales tax transfer to the transportation budget before it’s even begun.
House Transportation Committee Chair Jake Fey, D-Tacoma, is frustrated at the thought of losing that newfound money. The revenue is key to making his budget sustainable. Without it, projects could take longer and it would “put us in more of a squeeze,” he said.
“It’s not the greatest time to do that because we don’t know what we’re going to get for bids for a lot of the megaprojects,” Fey said last month. “We know that ferries is short on the capital side to do everything that we thought could be done back in 2022.”

He also pointed out there’s no solution to pay for the court-ordered removal of fish-blocking culverts beyond 2031.
When Fey discussed rumblings about the possible undoing of the transfer last month, he said he hadn’t heard from fellow lawmakers about it directly, but multiple lobbyists had mentioned the idea. Fixing the operating budget gap is expected to consume the Legislature in the legislative session that will begin next month. 
The $15.5 billion, two-year transportation funding plan earmarks money for state ferries, highway megaprojects, culverts and much more.
And after the revenue measures passed this year, state transportation doesn’t have veins left untapped to raise more money to replace the sales tax if it’s lost, Fey said. 
Senate Transportation Committee Chair Marko Liias, D-Everett, talked to House and Senate leadership and his takeaway was that the idea “doesn’t sound like it’s specifically on the table.” But if it came to fruition, it would be “spreading the misery of unsustainability,” he said.
The House’s chief operating budget writer confirmed the idea is, in fact, on the table.
“We’re looking at all of the various resources that are at our disposal,” said Rep. Timm Ormsby, D-Spokane. “I think it’s just prudent to take inventory of those resources. I’m not handicapping anything at this point.”
His Senate counterpart said she isn’t surprised the idea is coming up. 
“It was not popular among all lawmakers when we did it,” Sen. June Robinson, D-Everett, said last month.
Advocates at the time worried it would shortchange public school funding, which the state constitution calls the government’s “paramount duty.”
Gov. Bob Ferguson is expected to soon release his proposed supplemental budgets. They’ll act as frameworks for legislators to consider before deciding on adjustments to the two-year spending plan that took effect July 1. In the transportation sector, he’s expected to put a focus on preservation and maintenance of the state’s existing infrastructure over new projects.
Ferguson has said his plan will rely on cuts, not taxes, to balance after signing off on billions in new taxes this year. What that means for a transfer like the one being floated is unclear.

Mike Braun.,"The Indiana Senate Chamber during session on Monday, Feb. 5, 2024. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)President Donald Trump’s failed push for an Indiana congressional redistricting exposed divisions among Republicans who dominate the state Legislature and with Gov. Mike Braun.
The question of just how much the monthslong debate bruised those relationships will be a question when lawmakers return to the Statehouse in three weeks for resumption of their legislative session.
Several legislators interviewed following Thursday’s Senate vote rejecting the House-approved redistricting plan said they anticipated cooperation come January. Some put most of the blame for any animosity on national groups that tried to pressure legislators into supporting the new maps.
“I don’t think anybody wants to have a lasting impact,” said Sen. Sue Glick of LaGrange, who voted against redistricting. “There will be some hard feelings. But I thought that we kept it under control. There didn’t seem to be the acrimony on the floor that you might have anticipated. Most of that was coming from outside.”
Republican ties frayed by debate
But some were clearly offended by Braun’s threats to support election challengers against Republican senators who didn’t support the redrawn maps — including the chamber’s GOP leader, Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray.
Sen. Jean Leising of Oldenburg, who has been a senator for 25 years and voted against redistricting, said she believed Braun owed Bray an apology.

“I don’t know if he will,” Leising said. “If he were asking me, ‘What should I do next?’ I’d say, ‘You need to apologize to Senator Bray, our pro tem.’ Because he actually said that he wanted to work against him.”
The governor’s office did not reply to a request for comment about Leising’s remarks.
In a statement following the Senate vote, Braun said he “will be working with the President to challenge these people who do not represent the best interests of Hoosiers.”  
Bray acknowledged the redistricting debate as a “hard one” but downplayed the possibility of an ongoing split between the Senate, the House and the governor.
“There’s been a difference here, but we’ve got lots of important things to do over this next legislative session and over the next few years,” Bray told reporters after Thursday’s vote. “I have zero doubt that we’ll get that done together.”
Republican House Speaker Todd Huston said he was “disappointed” with the Senate vote while expressing optimism for the legislative session that’s set to resume Jan. 5.
“I’m confident we will have a productive session that will address the issues that most impact Hoosiers,” Huston said in a statement.
Will grudges remain?
Bray repeatedly said mid-decade redistricting had insufficient Senate support for it to pass, even with a pressure campaign that included two trips by Vice President JD Vance to Indianapolis and phone calls by Trump to individual senators.
Some senators, however, denounced what they regarded as bullying to win support for the proposed maps crafted to produce a 9-0 Republican delegation. It aimed to do so by carving up the two districts currently held by Democratic Reps. André Carson in Indianapolis and Frank Mrvan in the area along Lake Michigan near Chicago.
Several senators opposing the redistricting plan cited their support for Trump and hopes to see Republicans retain their U.S. House majority after the 2026 midterm elections.
But some redistricting advocates framed the debate in stark terms, such as when Senate Majority Floor Leader Chris Garten called on senators to be “active agents of American greatness” by supporting the 9-0 map plan.
Democratic Rep. Ed DeLaney of Indianapolis, who was first elected to the Legislature in 2008, said he was frustrated with the time he believed was “wasted” on the redistricting debate but that Braun was “duty bound” to patch up his relationship with lawmakers.
“I get along with him, I see him more than any governor I’ve ever seen,” DeLaney said. “I think he’s got the right personality to say, ‘Let’s just do the job, move forward under the facts as they are.’ I think he does. Now, whether he gets pushed from Washington to be a cheerleader in a raid on Indiana.”
Republican Sen. Eric Bassler of Washington said he believed Bray and Huston were “rationalists about running things” and would not hold grudges over the redistricting dispute.
“There’s going to be some wounds between the governor and our chamber,” Bassler said. “But my hope is that the governor and his staff and team will be adult about this and work well with us, just like I hope that the Senate will be adults about it and work well with the governor.”
Senate leadership shakeup?
The split among Republican senators — 21 voting joining 10 Democrats against redistricting and 19 in favor — prompted speculation over whether Bray was secure in the president pro tem position he’s held 2018.
Sen. Liz Brown, R-Fort Wayne, speaks during the Senate redistricting debate on Dec. 11, 2025.(Photo by Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
That possibility was dismissed by senators following Thursday’s 31-19 outcome.
“Absolutely not,” Leising said. “No, and his vote was even a little stronger than I predicted. I was, in my mind, saying 27 to 30 (against redistricting), and it was 31 so that made me really happy for him.”
Glick said she doesn’t expect any threats to Bray’s leadership, noting that “I can’t reveal what we discussed in caucus, but I can tell you that while all of this, the yeas and the nays have both complimented him on its fairness, on his willingness to address their issues.”
One fallout from the debate was the decision by Sen. Liz Brown, R-Fort Wayne, to step down from her position as Senate assistant majority floor leader in charge of communications while remaining a senator.
Brown said in a statement that she and other redistricting supporters “recognize the consequences of what it will mean to have socialists control Congress” and that the Senate had “failed our conservative voters.”
“Our caucus will have rebuilding to do to repair communication and trust with voters, and I will focus on that effort outside of Senate leadership,” Brown said.
Republican Sen. Linda Rogers of Granger was among the 10 senators who had kept quiet about their redistricting stance until Thursday’s vote, when she pushed the red “no” button on her desk.
When asked whether there would be lingering hard feelings over the maps decision, Rogers said: “I hope not, I don’t think so.”
“Some of my very closest friends here and I voted differently,” she said, “and we are still very close friends.”

At a time of attacks on the judicial system, a coalition of former state chief justices around the country has organized to educate the country about the role of the judiciary and the significance of its independence.
The Alliance of Former Chief Justices is a nonpartisan effort by more than 40 former state chief justices, including Barbara Pariente, who served on the Florida Supreme Court from 1997 to 2019 and was chief justice from 2004 to 2006. The group is a creation of Keep Our Republic, a nonpartisan civic education organization founded in 2020 to advocate for the rule of law and protecting democracy.
“There are increasing partisan attacks on judges in both the federal and state courts, not based on anything other than an outright partisan attack,” Pariente told the Phoenix in a phone interview last week. “And I think that it’s important for those of us who have been intricately involved with the judicial system to have our voices heard, because individual judges cannot speak out.”
President Donald Trump and allies in his administration and in Congress have questioned the legitimacy of federal judges in stark terms this year as jurists appointed by both Republicans (including Trump himself) and Democrats have rebuked his moves on illegal immigration, crime, and more.
Those verbal attacks led a bipartisan group of 150 former federal and state judges in May to send a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi condemning the Trump administration’s attacks on the judiciary.
Criticism of the judiciary isn’t new
Previous presidents have certainly expressed displeasure with the high court.
Following a series of decisions that halted key components of the New Deal, President Franklin D. Roosevelt stunned the nation in 1937 by introducing a plan to expand the court to gain favorable votes. The plan to “pack” the court was a bust with the American public and Congress, however, and died in the Senate Judiciary Committee just five weeks later.
During his State of the Union address in 2010, President Barack Obama bashed the Supreme Court for its Citizens United case. His later criticism of the court regarding an Arizona immigration case prompted then-Justice Antonin Scalia to fire back in a written dissent.

“It’s the most dangerous development I think in our country’s history,” Pariente said.
“There’s nothing wrong being unhappy with a decision. Litigants are unhappy all the time, but name-calling of the judges who rendered these decisions press against that. That is a danger, because it leads to undermining the rule of law, which has been something that has been a constant in this country for just about 250 years.”
Open letter 
In 1941, FDR declared Dec. 15 “Bill of Rights Day” to recognize the importance of the first 10 Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, ratified on that day in 1791. Noting the significance of that moment, the Alliance of Former Justices is posting an open letter standing up for the judiciary as a co-equal branch of government.
“Judges cannot take sides and keep their oath to provide equal justice to all,” the letter reads. “Some people, particularly those with strong policy views, chafe under this system. They may attack judges in the hope of influencing their rulings or convincing the public that the judiciary is just another political branch. While commenting on whether particular cases were rightly or wrongly decided is a basic part of public discourse, assertions that judges are mere politicians in robes are different. Such attacks undermine the integrity of the rule of law and threaten the promise of equal justice. These attacks upset the careful balance that Madison and the other Founders crafted to limit government overreach and protect the freedoms of all.”
Pariente says the news media often focus too much on whether a judge was appointed by a particular president, something she says doesn’t happen in the state court system (in part because Florida has been controlled by one political party — Republicans — going on three decades).
“I think the danger we see from the top from President Trump and his allies tends to affect the way the public then sees judges and their decision making,” she said.
For many years at the beginning of this century, Pariente was part of a bloc of justices considered liberal-leaning. That all changed around the time of the 2018 elections, when state law required her and two other justices (Peggy Quince and Fred Lewis) to step down because they’d reached the then-mandatory retirement age of 70 (a 2018 state constitutional amendment approved by the voters extended the mandatory retirement age for justices to 75).
The Phoenix asked Pariente whether she cared to weigh in on how conservative the Florida Supreme Court has become since she stepped down in 2018. That was the year Ron DeSantis was elected governor; he’s now appointed five of the seven justices serving on the bench.
“That’s something I’m not commenting on,” she said, laughing. “I need to stay within my wheelhouse.”",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/SupremeCourtIMG_20230907_163812140-1024x743.jpg,,,2025-12-15 07:57:19.153251

(Getty Images)As a teacher, I can explain how to balance a chemical equation or calculate the speed of a satellite in orbit, but school finance is far less straightforward. What I do know is that Indiana schools rely on two main funds, the education fund and the operations fund. How those funds work, and how state policy shapes them, has a direct impact on our classrooms, our communities and the future of our state.
The education fund pays teachers. It comes from the state on a per-student basis. More students equals more money. If your district is growing, then you can hire more teachers, add courses, and create more programs. You can afford to retain your best educators and recruit new ones. You can keep class sizes small. Families notice, they send their kids to your school, the district grows, more money comes in, and you spiral up. Everyone wins.
Unless your district loses students. Then you lose money. You have to cut teachers, offer fewer courses, and scale back programs. You can’t pay a competitive salary, so your best teachers leave and you struggle to recruit good ones. Families notice, they send their kids somewhere else, the district shrinks, less money comes in, and you spiral down. Everyone loses.
‘Smoke and Mirrors’: Democrats, critics denounce Republican budget proposal over school funding

Once the school district begins to fade, the rest of the community feels it too. Strong public schools are often the backbone of small towns across Indiana.
The operations fund pays primarily for buildings, transportation, maintenance, technology and athletic facilities. It comes from local property taxes, revenue that was significantly reduced under Senate Enrolled Act 1, Indiana’s 2025 property tax reform. Those changes mean less money for schools, fire departments, police, libraries, road maintenance and other local governments. Schools now have far fewer dollars to maintain and update their facilities. They must also begin sharing a portion of this property tax revenue with charter schools as the law phases in.
Indiana’s system forces schools to compete for students. In that competitive environment, visible facility upgrades — especially athletic projects — are often what families notice first. A brand new multipurpose turf field, a renovated weight room or an updated fieldhouse can draw attention and help a district attract families. Schools cannot use capital funds to pay teachers, so they use the limited flexibility they have to make improvements that help them stay competitive. When you see new athletic facilities, it does not mean a district has extra money. It often means they are doing whatever they can within the constraints of Indiana’s funding system to bring in more students.
As Indiana invests a growing share of state dollars into private voucher schools and as local revenue declines, the consequences are starting to show. Fewer Indiana students are going to college, and those who do are increasingly leaving the state. Many do not return. High-wage employers look for states with a highly educated workforce, and Indiana’s average salary continues to fall behind the national average.
Public education is an investment that has paid off for generations. It brings communities together at a time when unity is needed. Indiana should recognize the importance of strong public schools and treat them like the priority they need to be.
As both an educator and a parent with daughters in our public schools, I see every day how much strong and well-supported schools matter. I want every student in Indiana to have the same opportunities to grow and succeed.

(Photo by Stacy Revere/Getty Images)Republicans could gain nearly 200 state legislative seats across the South if the U.S. Supreme Court guts a key provision of the federal Voting Rights Acts, a new analysis finds.
The bulk of the gains would be concentrated in 10 GOP-controlled state legislatures in Southern states, according to the analysis, produced by Fair Fight Action, a Georgia-based progressive voting rights group, in partnership with Black Voters Matter Fund, which advocates on behalf of Black voters.
The analysis, featured in a report released by the groups on Monday, underscores the alarm among progressives over the potential consequences of the Supreme Court’s looming decision in a case known as Louisiana v. Callais. While the case centers on the constitutionality of Louisiana’s congressional map, the effects of the decision could extend into statehouses across the country.
The Supreme Court’s conservative majority appears likely to severely weaken Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, a landmark 1965 civil rights law that bans racial discrimination in voting access. Section 2 restricts racial gerrymandering, and until now has limited the power of lawmakers to draw districts that dilute the voting power of racial minority voters.
Supreme Court seems open to limiting consideration of race in Louisiana redistricting case

A sweeping decision by the court could give state lawmakers a freer hand to draw congressional and state legislative districts that dilute the power of minority voters — as well as districts for local governments, such as county commissions, city councils and school boards. The justices held oral arguments in October; a decision could come at any time.
At the state legislative level, a court ruling that strikes down Section 2 could lead to Democrats losing about 191 seats, according to the analysis, which examined how state legislative districts could be redrawn if Section 2 is no longer in place. Most of those seats are currently held by Black lawmakers in districts where minority voters make up a majority of residents.
“What that is doing is providing a fatal blow to Black representation in the South,” Fair Fight Action CEO Lauren Groh-Wargo said in an interview.
The total number of state legislative districts in 10 Southern states where Black or Hispanic voters comprise a majority could fall from 342 to 202. Those states are Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.
Some Republican states argue that courts have interpreted Section 2’s protections too broadly and in the process wrongly restrained the ability of lawmakers to draw favorable maps.
Alabama and 13 other GOP states said in a brief filed with the Supreme Court earlier this year that Section 2 has been turned into “the proverbial golden hammer, wielded by plaintiffs and courts in a never-ending search for a nail.”
If the Supreme Court weakens the Voting Rights Act, it’s unclear whether state legislatures would pursue mid-decade redraws of state legislative districts. Redistricting typically occurs every 10 years following the census.
At the federal level, a previous analysis by Fair Fight Action and Black Voters Matter Fund projected Republicans could draw an additional 19 U.S. House seats if Section 2 protections were removed.
While a few states have passed new congressional maps already this year, those efforts have proven highly controversial. Some states, such as Indiana and Kansas, have abandoned or rejected them for now.

When gunfire rips through some Detroit neighborhoods, ShotSpotter hears it first — but where exactly that signal comes from is a secret kept even from police.
Critics of Detroit’s gunshot detection system have pointed to a lack of transparency as a concern since the city first signed a $1.5 million contract for the audio surveillance program in 2020.
Many of those concerns have centered on transparency to the public — but some parts of the program are not even transparent to the Detroit Police Department, as officials admit they don’t know where the sensors for ShotSpotter are located.
Regardless, Deputy Chief Mark Bliss insists that fact does not impact the department’s oversight of the program.
But some aren’t convinced by Bliss’s argument, saying that without knowing where the sensors are, it’s hard to know how well the city knows what’s going on within its own program.
“The city actually isn’t in a position to verify that there isn’t a problem with where the sensors are located,” said Eric Williams, the Detroit Justice Center’s managing director. “For example, the city can say, well, we don’t know if it’s too close to someone’s house or apartment, or in a place where it could be potentially problematic. The city doesn’t know that information.”
Linda Bernard, a member of the city’s Board of Police Commissioners, the supervisory body for the police department, agreed that the secretive nature of the ShotSpotter program concerned her, though she emphasized the importance of preventing gunfire in the city. 
“We can’t provide oversight about something if we don’t know what it is,” Bernard said. “And we don’t know what it is or where it is.”

ShotSpotter, owned by the company SoundThinking Inc., uses audio sensors placed in certain regions throughout the city and sends alerts to the police department when gunfire sounds are picked up. When a noise that could be a gunshot — or a firework or a car backfiring — is picked up by one of those sensors, that raw data goes to ShotSpotter to determine if it is in fact a gunshot. If it is, an alert with the location of the gunshot goes out to DPD. 
The process for determining the locations of the sensors is simple, at least on paper. In short, Bliss explained, the police department informed ShotSpotter staff which areas they want to cover — high gunfire areas — and then the company determined where exactly to place the sensors. 
“The sensors are placed by ShotSpotter when we identify an area, because ShotSpotter has to look at the acoustics and what’s the best, most accurate way for placement to get the best type of acoustics,” he said.
“When we looked at where to place ShotSpotter, we did an analysis on gun crime,” he added. “And that’s where we put the sensors. Where are we getting a lot of non-fatal shootings or homicides or shots fired?”
When asked why DPD was not informed about the location of those sensors even after ShotSpotter determined their best locations, Bliss said that 911 calls coming from the community act as a form of checks and balances — if the department gets a call that there is gunfire in an area that should be covered without a corresponding ShotSpotter alert, they know that there may be a malfunctioning sensor or other issue that needs to be addressed.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
But Molly Kleinman, the managing director of the Science, Technology, and Public Policy program at the University of Michigan, sees it differently.
“In terms of the best practices for any city that is contracting with a company for any sort of surveillance technology, whether that’s gunshot detection, whether that’s license plate readers, whether that’s other kinds of cameras, is that the city absolutely needs to know the locations of these things,” Kleinman told Michigan Advance.
Kleinman added that she believes that the general public should also have access to the locations of surveillance technologies more broadly, though cities will often push back against that level of access, citing security concerns.
“There are a lot of things that I would expect a city to have access to from the company that it’s contracting with for surveillance technology,” she said. “Just in principle, it’s not great that Detroit doesn’t have access to the locations of the ShotSpotter sensors.”



SoundThinking told the Advance in a statement that the company does not disclose precise locations of sensors to any customer, including the Detroit Police Department.
“Keeping sensor locations confidential protects the privacy of community members who host sensors and reduces the risk of tampering, vandalism, or attempts to evade detection,” the company wrote.
 “Importantly, this policy does not impact oversight of the program by the Police Department or the City in any way. Detroit defines each ShotSpotter coverage area and the boundaries of those areas,” SoundThinking’s statement continued. “The exact placement of individual sensors within those boundaries is not operationally relevant to DPD or the City and does not affect their ability to evaluate performance, direct policy, or exercise oversight.”
A growing chorus of skepticism—including from the bench
ShotSpotter, used in over 180 cities according to the company’s webpage, has been the target of wide-ranging criticism, both in Detroit and nationwide. 
For example, Chicago last year allowed its contract with ShotSpotter to lapse after a series of systemic failures. A 2021 report from the city’s Inspector General showed that the technology was failing to lead to an increase in investigative stops or evidence of gun crimes. And in August, the city settled a lawsuit for $90,000 that alleged the city’s police department used ShotSpotter alerts as a pretext for unlawful stops, especially in Black and brown communities.
In Detroit, where the technology has been in place in the 8th and 9th Precincts since 2020, critics of the program have raised similar concerns.

Most recently, the Michigan Court of Appeals ruled in October that the city violated the Community Input Over Government Surveillance ordinance in 2022 when they failed to post required oversight reports until after the city had already voted to extend the first contract and just two weeks before voting to expand the technology into other parts of the city. 
“With surveillance and similar technology ever encroaching into every recess of modern life, procedural safeguards cannot be ignored or downplayed by government actors as mere technicalities,” Judge Brock A. Swartzle wrote in the court’s opinion. “To ensure that technology serves the people, and not the other way around, strict compliance with procedural safeguards like the CIOGS Ordinance may well be needed. And, unfortunately, such compliance was lacking here.”
In the wake of that decision, Williams raised further concerns about the lack of transparency and a lack of accountability for Detroit residents — including transparency on where the sensors are.
“Those are obligations that the city has. That’s not optional. That was one of the things that came out of the appellate decision. DPD [Detroit Police Department] has to follow the law,” he said of the court’s decision. “I do not see how DPD could fully comply with the ordinance, if, for example, they don’t even know specifically where the sensors are.”
The ordinance does not specifically require the disclosure of the locations of surveillance sensors such as those used in ShotSpotter. But Kleinman emphasized that, though not violating the letter of the law, the fact that the city does not have access to the locations raises concerns. 
“Responsible oversight of surveillance technology includes knowing where it is,” she said.
The city’s $7 million contract for the program is up for renewal in June 2026, before which point advocates like Williams hope there will be increased disclosure from the city on its effectiveness in lowering gun crime in Detroit. 
In the upcoming contract renegotiation process, Bernard added that she believed that access to information like the locations of sensors could be used as a negotiation tactic.
“When it comes to their customers, I think they should be more forthcoming, and maybe that would be a bargaining point for us in terms of a new contract with them,” Bernard said. “I think that that effort should be made, because it will improve our ability to make the residents of the city of Detroit safe, and that’s our objective.”

Hundreds of posts on X, formerly known as Twitter, in late November began questioning the attorney general’s competence and character, honing in on her defense of Missouri’s gerrymandered congressional map and crack down on intoxicating hemp products. 
“She should be impeached and dismissed from her position as attorney general,” one post declared. 
But according to investigators at the social media analytics company Graphika, the attacks were not an organic reaction to a high-profile and controversial announcement. Instead, researchers found they were a coordinated campaign, likely originating in China and conducted by fake accounts. 
A network of 105 inauthentic pro-China X accounts were involved, according to Margot Hardy, the Graphika intelligence analyst who was involved in the research and an expert in Chinese influence operations. 
About half of the accounts were created in November and December. Many display gaming or animation-related profile pictures, have few or no followers and use randomly generated account handles. 
Graphika has studied this type of activity before, Hardy said, but most of the time it targets people who are dissidents of China or exiles in the U.S. 
“This is interesting, because we don’t often see China-linked or pro-China actors targeting specific U.S. individuals at the local level,” Hardy said, “which is something rather more sophisticated. So that’s why we reported on this activity.”
Posting activity dropped sharply on weekends and during the Golden Week holiday in early  October that celebrates the founding of the People’s Republic of China. The timing of the posts during the workday, Hardy said, signals that there is likely a “commercial actor” behind the campaign and that the network is likely based in China. 
The accounts in the network have shared other pro-China positions, such as calling for lifting bans on Huawei, the Chinese tech company banned in the U.S. out of concern its equipment could be used for espionage. Some accounts previously engaged in another coordinated campaign in late November that portrayed the U.S. as a “scam-friendly” nation and an “empire of espionage.”
Several posts misused pronouns, referring to Hanaway as “he,” and misspelled her name as “Kathleen Hanaway” or “Hanawi,” suggesting the possible use of auto-translation tools to produce the content.
This activity, Hardy said, demonstrates how pro-China actors respond to criticism of Beijing or calls for COVID-19 accountability by attempting to discredit those individuals.
“We are not threatened by online trolls from China, and remain undeterred in our efforts to seize Chinese assets,” Hanaway said in an email to The Independent. “Missourians deserve justice.”
Missouri wants to seize Chinese assets to recover $24 billion judgment in COVID case

In late 2020, the state of Missouri sued China for that country’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak. In March, U.S. District Judge Stephen Limbaugh awarded Missouri $24 billion after China did not defend itself in the lawsuit. 
In his ruling, Limbaugh wrote that China concealed the true nature of COVID-19 so it could stockpile protective gear that could limit spread of the virus. He found that Missouri lost tax revenue due to the pandemic and will experience a long-term loss of revenue as well, accepting the state’s the $8 billion estimate for the period 2020 to 2051. He added the state’s increased cost for protective gear, estimated at $123 million, due to the hoarding and tripled the amount to set the final judgment.
The judgment is against the Chinese government, the Communist Party of China, several national agencies, provincial and local governments around Wuhan and the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
Hanaway has formally asked the U.S. State Department to notify China that the state intends to pursue assets with full or partial Chinese government ownership to satisfy the judgment. The attorney general’s office is also assembling a list of Chinese properties that could be targeted, with a focus on properties wholly owned by the Chinese government or by companies in which the Chinese government has a stake.
“China owes Missourians $24 billion,” Hanaway said. “The People’s Republic of China is answerable to the extraordinary harm it inflicted on our citizens and our economy.”
Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, D.C., said in an emailed statement last month that China’s policies and measures during the pandemic were “acts of national sovereignty and are not subject to the jurisdiction of U.S. courts.”
China will not pay, Pengy said, and “will retaliate if necessary.”
The campaign of pro-China attacks on Hanaway appears to have petered out, Hardy said. This network’s activity does not appear to have gained organic traction on X, and Graphika did not find that the network branched out to other social media platforms.
“A possible rational explanation (for the campaign) could be that her remarks were reported in the region,” Hardy said. “Or it could be that there was a specific Chinese state media coverage that triggered this. But for sure, it’s not typical to see this level of involvement at the local level targeting a specific U.S. official.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54948770823_1af34324cd_c-e1765556903720.jpg,,,2025-12-15 06:56:29.247423

They need to learn — or be reminded — that as elected officials their first obligation is to uphold the laws of the Missouri Constitution as they fight for the welfare and well-being of the citizens they represent.
For years now, Missouri’s Republican lawmakers seem perfectly comfortable at ignoring that reality if it is convenient or aids in pushing a personal or party agenda.
The most recent litany of exploits involve the gerrymandered map designed to dissolve a Democratic congressional district in order to give Republicans the advantage in commandeering another seat in the 2026 midterm election — all to help the president in his efforts to maintain control of Congress.
The non-stop efforts to force the gerrymandered map down Missourians throats continue despite:
–           A federal judge refusal to rule on a case to block a statewide vote on the gerrymandered districts filed by Attorney General Catherine Hanaway on behalf of Missouri’s Republican leaders.
–           The months of wrangling — which continues in the courts — over when the collection of signatures for a statewide petition can be legally started.
–           The gathering and filing of over 300,000 signatures, almost three times the required minimum of 110,000, before the deadline.
Despite these actions, perhaps the most brazen of them all in efforts to show that the will of the people be damned, Secretary of State Denny Hoskins declared that the gerrymandered map will go into effect anyway.
He has claimed to have the unilateral authority to declare the referendum to put the gerrymandered map on the November 2026 null and void even if the requisite signatures to do so are deemed valid.
There are bound to be additional challenges and lawsuits, the outcome of which is anyone’s guess. It all seems so needless if only the rule of law was followed and the will of the majority was allowed to rule.
But the tug of war between lawmakers and those they should be representing is not new with the gerrymandered map issue. It is just the latest battle.
Of particular note is that 62% of Missourians passed a constitutional amendment in 2018 known as the Clean Missouri initiative that would have required legislative districts to be drawn to ensure partisan fairness. That sounds right and reasonable, doesn’t it?
Yet in 2021, the legislature put a deceptively worded measure on the ballot to repeal that amendment, which garnered 51% of the vote. The Clean Missouri initiative never went into effect.
What we have instead is the practice and pattern of lawmakers going through extraordinary measures to obfuscate, block or undue laws and measures supported and passed by the people.
In a previous column, I addressed many of those instances. Ignoring or undoing the will of Missourians have occurred in both broad sweeping and nuanced areas.
We need to keep some top of mind.
This year, we have seen sick pay leave that was overwhelmingly approve by Missouri voters and the cost-of-living minimum wage adjustments undone by the governor with the stroke of a pen.
In 2024, Missouri voters approved access to legal abortions as an option in reproductive health care services. The Republican-controlled legislature has since passed a measure to put the issue back on the ballot in 2026in an effort to make abortion illegal again.
Voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2020, only to see the legislature block funding. After several legal battles, the measure finally took effect in late 2021.
Other laws and measures have been pursued and passed that ignore or undo the will of Missouri citizens in recent years. A majority of Missourians are against state control of city police departments, discrimination by landlords against renters who receive public assistance and other measures that negatively impact the daily lives of fellow Missourians.
The Trump administration has made disregarding the constitution, the rule of law and rights of Americans normal operating procedure.
But the Republican-controlled Missouri legislature’s actions over the years show that the seeds of oligarchal or authoritarian rule have existed all along.
What does it mean?
Clearly, it means that only lip-service or a passing nod is given to the democratic rules, laws and processes that govern ballot measures, determining the will of the majority vs. the tyrannical rule of the few.
More importantly, there is a consistent message being sent that voters do not know which policy measures are in the best interests of their family, community or state.
To add insult to injury, those same legislators must believe that voters also have short memories and will continue to vote for them, or those of like-minds, in election cycle after election cycle.
The questions we should ask ourselves are:
Why do we go along with such behavior, year after year?
Why are we comfortable with the actions of the few — would-be oligarchs, authoritarians, or their puppets — ruling the day and determining how our state will be governed?
Forcing the gerrymandered map down our throats is the latest usurpation of the laws and rights of Missourians in a line of many in recent years.
What will it take to make it the last?",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG_4515-scaled-e1725567309853-1024x614.jpeg,,,2025-12-15 06:56:29.247423

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)A federal jury will begin hearing the case against Milwaukee County Circuit Court Hannah Dugan, 66, on Monday in a lawsuit that has drawn national attention, weighing how far the Trump administration can go in squashing resistance to its nationwide crackdown on immigrants. 
The case revolves around events in  April, when Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, a 30-year-old Mexican immigrant who had  been charged with battery, appeared in Dugan’s courtroom. Federal agents also arrived at the courtroom that day, seeking Flores-Ruiz, whom they said entered the country illegally over a decade ago. 
The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
Dugan confronted  the federal agents as they waited outside her courtroom. Later, she led Flores-Ruiz  and his attorney out of her courtroom through a side door which led  into the same hallway where the federal agents were waiting. Flores-Ruiz was followed into the elevator and outside by the agents, who chased and then arrested him. 
Days later, Dugan was arrested and handcuffed by FBI agents and charged with obstruction and concealing an individual. FBI Director Kash Patel posted photographs of Dugan in handcuffs and celebrated her arrest, writing on X, “No one is above the law.” 
In early April, prior to Flores-Ruiz, ICE arrested two other people at the Milwaukee County Courthouse. Officials expressed concerns that the arrests were causing defendants, witnesses and victims to avoid coming to court or cooperating with law enforcement. 
Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley objected to what he characterized as intimidation tactics in enforcing its immigration crackdown and wielding the power of the state against  “anyone who opposes these policies.” In a statement, Crowley said, “we have an obligation to administer our courts in a safe, efficient manner that delivers due process for anyone.” 
Christine Neumann-Ortiz, executive director of the immigrant rights group Voces de la Frontera, said that the Trump officials  “basically want to be unleashed to do whatever they want to commit these raids in courtrooms across the country.” Milwaukee-area Democratic Sens. Chris Larson and Tim Carpenter and Reps. Christine Sinicki, Darrin Madison, Supreme Moore Omokunde, Angelito Tenorio, and Sequanna Taylor issued a joint statement calling the county courthouse “a sanctuary for justice and peace where the accused come forward willingly in a fair an unbiased process”, and warned that “arresting people out of a courtroom will lead to a breakdown of civil society.”

At the end of April, the Wisconsin Supreme Court suspended Dugan with pay. Her case catalyzed protests outside the Milwaukee FBI Office, and was repeatedly mentioned at the summer’s No Kings protests. In July, Republican lawmakers introduced a bill to withhold pay for suspended judges. 
“In these rare circumstances, these judges’ actions and alleged misconduct rose to such a level that suspension was warranted,” the bill’s authors, Sen. Cory Tomczyk (R-Mosinee), Assembly Majority Leader Tyler August (R-Walworth) and Rep. Shae Sortwell (R-Two Rivers) wrote said in a memo.  “Simply put, Wisconsin taxpayers must be protected from the misconduct and/or commission of a crime by rogue judges.”
If convicted, Dugan, who has pleaded not guilty, faces six years in prison. Her legal team initially attempted to have the case thrown out,  t arguing that Dugan is covered by  judicial immunity. That argument was rejected by U.S. Magistrate Judge Nancy Joseph of the Eastern District of Wisconsin, who wrote that judges have civil immunity for official actions, but not criminal immunity, and that the case should go forward.
 
“As she said after her unnecessary arrest, Judge Dugan asserts her innocence and looks forward to being vindicated in court,” Dugan’s defense attorneys said in a statement.

On Thursday night, a crowd gathered outside the federal courthouse to support Dugan. 
Therese Heeg, 66, told the Wisconsin Examiner that she felt a responsibility to attend the rally to “protect our democracy for my children, my grandchildren, my son-in-law who’s unable to live in the U.S. because he’s from Africa, my best friend’s children who are Hispanic who are afraid for their lives, even though they’re citizens.” Heeg said she’s worried about immigration enforcement coming to the city to take people away. “Every single day there’s more and more atrocities happening right here,” said Heeg. “We are trapping people in camps…I used to wonder what it was like to live under the Nazis, and now I know, I’m living it. It’s shocking, it’s hard to comprehend at the same time that it’s happening every single day. 
Jury selection on Thursday was  closed off from the public and media by U.S. District Judge Lynn Adelman, who is hearing the case. Adelman was responding to concerns from both the prosecution and defense that public questioning would taint the jury. An audio feed allowing media to listen to the jury selection process was restored following a legal   challenge by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.
Sister Barbara Pfarr, who is among the leaders of the faith-based social justice group MICAH, said that the national attention on Dugan’s case shows that the judge struck a nerve by standing up to the  Trump administration. Pfarr was disturbed by the effort to restrict press access during jury selection, and wondered whether anything similar would happen during the trial. “That’s the other big reason that I’m here, we’ve lost our democracy.”

The federal Administration for Children and Families is calling on states, including Wisconsin, to stop diverting Social Security and other federal benefits that are supposed to be made available to foster children. (Wisconsin Examiner photo)Federal officials are urging 39 states, including Wisconsin, to quit hoarding federal benefits that are supposed to go to children in foster care, but that agencies instead take to help pay for their foster care expenses.
The practice has been going on in various states for two decades or more, according to advocates who have been calling to ban it for nearly as long.
Wisconsin is among the states that received letters last week from the federal Administration for Children and Families, calling on them to stop diverting Social Security survivor’s benefits that are supposed to go to foster children.
“Every earned benefit dollar belongs to these foster youth, not the government agencies or bureaucrats,” said Alex J. Adams, the ACF assistant secretary, in a press release from ACF and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
“ACF has notified all 39 governors who allow this practice and aims to work with states to end it,” the press release stated. “The goal is to ensure these earned benefits are no longer taken from foster youth and are instead preserved to support them as they transition out of state care.”
In Wisconsin, the office of Gov. Tony Evers pointed to a provision Evers included in his proposed 2025-27 state budget to end the practice, but that Republican lawmakers removed without comment at the start of budget deliberations.

“It’s been a long-time issue now, but unfortunately it has been largely under the radar,” said Daniel Hatcher, a University of Baltimore law professor and an early critic of the practice. Hatcher has advocated on behalf of affected foster children for more than two decades and written extensively about the issue, including in the Wisconsin Law Review.
A Marshall Project-National Public Radio project in 2021 found that 49 states at the time were rerouting foster children’s federal benefits to cover some of their costs. Hatcher said that has helped raise more attention to the issue.
“I think most people, when you talk to them about this practice, when they  understand what’s going on, they’re outraged,” Hatcher told the Wisconsin Examiner.
Foster children who would qualify for Social Security survivors’ benefits or veterans’ survivor benefits because their parents have died, as well as foster children who themselves have disabilities and qualify for Social Security disability payments (SSI) have all been affected, Hatcher said.
Hatcher first publicized the practice in a 2006 law review article that documented how state and local child welfare agencies, or the private contractors that they engage to manage their programs, were intercepting federal benefits that are supposed to go to foster children.
“The agencies identify foster children who are disabled or have deceased or disabled parents, apply for Social Security benefits on the children’s behalf, and then take the children’s benefits to reimburse foster care costs for which the children have no legal obligation,” Hatcher wrote.
A U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 2003 upheld the practice, but advocates have been fighting to end it ever since.
In Wisconsin, Hatcher wrote in a 2018 op-ed article for the CapTimes, the administration of then-Gov. Scott Walker signed a contract in 2011 with Maximus Inc. that the management company used to “increase the number of children classified as disabled and to locate children with deceased birth parents — not to provide more services to the children, but so the state can take their resources.”
Drawing on public records, Hatcher estimated that the contract yielded at least $3 million “in survivor and disability benefits from foster children each year” in Milwaukee County alone, “and the state has been taking millions more from foster children in other jurisdictions.”
Earlier this year the Evers administration estimated that about $3.2 million each year was being diverted from foster children’s SSI or Social Security survivors’ benefits, with about 95% going to fund the foster care system. The figures were cited in a Legislative Fiscal Bureau’s March summary of Evers’ proposed 2025-27 budget.
The governor’s budget proposal included a provision to end the diversion and instead deposit the benefits in trust funds for each child in foster care.
The proposal also included language to prohibit the Department of Children and Families or county child welfare agencies from using those funds to pay for foster care. DCF officials said the department would seek additional funding in the state budget to replace what counties lost as a result, according to the fiscal bureau’s summary.
The proposal to stop diverting the benefits was one of more than 600 items in Evers’ draft budget that the Republican majority on the Legislature’s budget-writing Joint Finance Committee deleted on the first day of budget deliberations.
Asked whether the Evers administration had any comment on the federal notice last week, the governor’s communications director, Britt Cudaback, replied in an email message, “Nothing beyond the fact we already tried to address this, but Republican lawmakers rejected the effort.”
Before his confirmation as ACF assistant secretary, Adams was director of the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare. In May, he directed the department to stop diverting foster children’s survivor benefits, the Idaho Capital Sun reported.
Idaho is one of 11 states that have ended the diversion of survivor benefits, according to the DHS/ACF press release.

The Children’s Advocacy Institute at the University of San Diego has identified at least eight states and the District of Columbia that have completely banned the diversion of all benefits designated for foster children. A number of other states have attempted to stop the diversion of selected benefits.
The federal notice marks an important step in the campaign to end the practice, said Amy Harfeld, the institute’s national policy director.
“We’re very excited about what this does,” Harfeld told the Wisconsin Examiner. “It doesn’t fix the whole problem but it sets a really solid marker in the ground that not only keeps states moving forward but leads toward the next changes that need to be made to actually put an end to it.”
The Children’s Advocacy Institute acknowledges Wisconsin’s unsuccessful attempt to curb the practice in the 2025 budget.
With the failure of that effort, however, “Wisconsin isn’t looking so good right now,” Harfeld said. “It’s one of only 11 states that haven’t done anything.”

(Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)It’s been nearly three months since the Oklahoma Ethics Commission took down its database that tracks critical parts of our legislative and election processes, including candidate spending, lobbying and political action committees.
When they removed public access to the system known as Guardian on Sept. 19, to change the software system, they promised the interruption would be brief. It would be back up and running by late October, they said.
Now we’re smack dab in the middle of December, and no one in state government seems to know when Guardian will be back in working order.
We’re weeks away from the start of the 2026 legislative session, and an essential tool that helps the public understand who is spending what is still out of commission. The shutdown is impeding lobbyists from registering – a key function in identifying those who can have the most influence on our lawmakers – and also it’s also hindering candidates from filing about the political donations they’ve received. 
But even more alarming is the fact that Lee Anne Bruce Boone, who heads the Ethics Commission, said last week that the commission  is “preparing temporary contingency options to support reporting if the vendor cannot finalize the remaining issues within a very short window.”
She refused to give a date for when Guardian will work again.
That doesn’t sound promising.
Meanwhile, there was a special GOP primary election last week for House District 35, which covers parts of Pawnee, Payne, Creek, Noble and Osage counties in the northern central part of the state.
The one way the public can access Ethics Commission data right now is by formally requesting it from the agency. As someone who has had to request information from various entities hundreds of times as part of my job, I can tell you that it is not nearly as easy as typing a name into a search bar and hitting “enter.” 
Bruce Boone has said her office has filled every public data request while the online system hasn’t been accessible.
But the public shouldn’t have to ask Bruce Boone and her staff to fulfill records like that when these are records that have long been available online in an easy-to-access format.
If someone wants to know who is bankrolling their local legislative candidates, they shouldn’t have to formally ask a state agency for that information and reveal that they’re looking at it. 
As a journalist, sometimes I want to quickly check who has formally filed as a candidate or if someone who is going door-to-door in the Capitol is a registered lobbyist. If they are, I want to know what they’re spending on campaigns to try to influence our lawmakers, and if they’re being wined and dined outside of our Statehouse by groups trying to gain their favor.
Often, I don’t publish the information. It simply informs my reporting and knowledge, so it’s silly to ask a state agency to spend the time compiling it.
Another reason voters might feel the impact of Guardian being down is that groups are gathering signatures for state ballot questions. 
Recently, I had a reader contact me to ask who was running signature collections on a petition that seeks to open primaries to all voters regardless of political affiliation because she had a negative interaction with a signature collector outside of a business. She deserves to know who is funding that effort.
Candidates eyeing state offices in 2026 and political action committees for and against them are already inundating the airwaves with commercials.
In June, voters will be asked at the ballot box to consider increasing the minimum wage to $15 an hour.
Oklahomans deserve to know who is financing those initiatives. And it shouldn’t require formally requesting records from the Ethics Commission to find that out.
While sometimes not the easiest system to navigate, the old Guardian system used to meet that need.
The Ethics Commission, right now, appears to be full of excuses for why this system is off-line.
In a statement, Bruce Boone said the data “require substantially more remediation and validation than anticipated, resulting in delays outside the Commission’s control” and pointed the finger at an unnamed vendor who they said had pledged to have it operational by October.
I blame the Ethics Commission. 
They chose to take this system offline at this critical junction. And they know — or should have known — what data their system needs to process.
And if they’re not already, they should be working around the clock to get this up by the end of the month.
Because government transparency is the unfortunate casualty of this incompetence.

(Photo courtesy of Oklahoma Department of Aerospace and Aeronautics)The Oklahoma Aerospace and Aeronautics Commission voted Wednesday to allocate $490,900 to designs for a spacecraft hangar.


The commission’s decision comes after the state’s $17 million agreement with international space company Dawn Aerospace was approved earlier this year. The uncrewed plane is suborbital and can be used for life science research and defense.
Oklahoma’s Burns Flat air and space port was chosen to be the first in the United States to host Dawn Aerospace’s plane, which is set to begin flights in 2027.
Now, the port needs a place to store the spacecraft.
Plans for the new facility include a control room with a viewing area and a payload processing facility, according to Nick Young, airports division manager for the state Department of Aerospace and Aeronautics. It would also include office space and a meeting room.
The design could take between six and eight months to complete, said executive director Grayson Ardies. Construction could last up to 10 months.
Once in operation, Ardies said the plane’s first 100 flights will be gifted to researchers from Oklahoma institutions.
“We will  do a selective process on what we believe are the best research projects, and those will be able to go up free,” he said.
In July, the Oklahoma Space Industry Development Authority (OSIDA) merged into the Department of Aerospace and Aeronautics after the passage of Senate Bill 912, authored by Sen. Paul Rosino, R-Oklahoma City, and Rep. Nick Archer, R-Elk City. Although OSIDA is still operating, the legislation phased out its board and gave its responsibilities to the Oklahoma Aerospace and Aeronautics Commission.
The commission also voted to spend about $160,000 on a statewide space industry study, likely conducted by the consulting firm Artemis Group. The company is currently contracted by the department to help with  workforce recruiting.
Ardies said the recent restructuring is part of the reason for investing in the plan.
“ We felt like it would be best for them to work on this strategic plan given their knowledge of the space industry in Oklahoma,” he said.

The Joint Appropriations Committee wrapped up its first round of hearings Friday. 
The post Five takeaways from the Wyoming Legislature’s budget hearings appeared first on WyoFile .","The Wyoming Legislature’s Joint Appropriations Committee wrapped up two weeks of budget hearings Friday in Cheyenne and adjourned until Jan. 5, when the committee will reconvene for the remaining agency presentations.
Lawmakers will be responsible for crafting and passing the state’s next two-year spending plan, also known as a biennium budget, during the upcoming 2026 legislative session. It is the one task lawmakers are constitutionally obligated to complete in even-numbered years. 
The process formally kicked off in November, when Gov. Mark Gordon provided his $11.1 billion draft budget recommendation. Lawmakers ultimately hold the purse strings, so the governor’s recommendations are just that. 
The hearings followed the governor’s opening bid and provided an opportunity for agencies to make their own suggestions and justifications, and for lawmakers to interrogate the requests. As part of that, each state agency presents what’s called a standard budget, which includes no more than the amount needed to enable that office to provide the same level of services in the next budget cycle as it has in the current one. 
If an agency seeks to diverge from that spending level, such as for new equipment or a special project, it must develop and present an “exception request” to lawmakers. 
The first two weeks of hearings included about 40 state agencies. Here are five takeaways from those discussions. 
Lawmakers are grappling with the proper role of government
The Wyoming Freedom Caucus — a group of Republicans who won control of the House in 2024 — pledged earlier this year to reduce the state’s budget, citing “pre-pandemic spending levels” as a general target. 
Exactly what those cuts will look like remains to be seen, but a desire for smaller government appears to be driving the initiative. 
In separate discussions with the Wyoming Business Council and the Wyoming Department of Health, Freedom Caucus lawmakers pushed back on funding requests as inappropriate uses of tax dollars. 
“I just don’t see how this is the proper role of government,” Rep. Ken Pendergraft, R-Sheridan, said in response to a proposal by the health department to try and prevent residents from falling into financial ruin resulting from catastrophic illness or injury. 
The week before, Pendergraft made similar remarks to the Wyoming Business Council, which is urging lawmakers to earmark funds to help communities meet business-friendly infrastructure needs, like extending water and sewer service to business parks. 
“How do you answer those that say it is not the role of government to build infrastructure?” Pendergraft asked Josh Dorrell, CEO of the business council. 
There are numerous examples across Wyoming, Dorrell said, that indicate the state’s minimal “investment in infrastructure” isn’t enough to boost economic prosperity and job creation.

Wildfire legislation 
While lawmakers did not take any formal action on the budget bill throughout the two weeks of hearings, the committee voted to sponsor three bills aimed at wildfire response. 
One piece of legislation would establish a 12-person wildland fire suppression team, a second bill would authorize wildland firefighters to participate in Wyoming’s retirement system. Additionally, the committee voted to sponsor a third proposal that would authorize firefighters to receive hazard pay and paid time off. 
“I urge the Legislature to support our coherent recommendations to enhance our ability to put out fires from the start,” Gordon wrote in his budget letter. 
The bills will now be up for consideration by the full Legislature when it convenes in February. 
Federal cuts are shaping budget requests
Several state agencies are feeling the effects of federal cuts.
The Department of Family Services, for example, is asking lawmakers to use state dollars to cover a reduction in federal funding of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, better known as SNAP. About 28,000 state residents, mostly children, rely on SNAP to buy groceries. 
Starting next October, the Trump administration’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act will shift billions in SNAP costs from the federal government onto states. The bill also makes changes to program eligibility, shifts a significant portion of administrative costs to states and ends a nutrition-education program. 
As part of its request, DFS is asking lawmakers to fund the nutrition-education program so that it is not eliminated in Wyoming.
“This is an educational program for people who have very low incomes to learn how to stretch their food dollar further, to learn how to build healthy activities into their lifestyle, and to help their children do the same,” DFS Director Korin Schmidt told lawmakers. 
In his own recommendations, Gordon urged legislators to spend $5.5 million to mitigate federal SNAP cuts.

Meanwhile, Wyoming PBS is facing a $3 million funding shortfall after Congress rescinded $9 billion in previously allocated funds in July, effectively cutting all federal support for NPR, PBS and their member stations. 
Wyoming PBS CEO Joanna Kail has defended the state’s congressional delegation and their vote to gut the federal funding her agency has historically relied on. 
“PBS lost the trust of many Americans because it stopped listening to them,” Kail reiterated to lawmakers on Wednesday. “Concerns about bias, whether others agreed with them or not, were real to the people who raised them. When people feel dismissed, they withdraw their trust. And that loss ultimately led to the nationwide loss of federal funding for public broadcasting.” 
Wyoming PBS is now asking state lawmakers to fill its funding shortfall. 
What wasn’t said 
In 2023, the Wyoming Department of Corrections sent 240 inmates to be housed in a private prison in Mississippi due to staffing shortages. 
Today, 128 of those inmates remain in Mississippi, WDOC Director Dan Shannon told lawmakers. As such, the department is asking lawmakers for a one-time appropriation of $9.3 million to cover out-of-facility housing expenses. 
“This request includes transportation expenses to initiate the exit plan upon reaching reasonable staffing levels,” the department’s budget request states. “Once all of our inmates are returned to the WDOC facilities, we will revert any unused funding.” 
Lawmakers, meanwhile, did not broach the subject of an ongoing lawsuit against several former and current officials at the women’s prison in Lusk. 
In the last five years, three former prison guards at the Wyoming Women’s Center have been convicted and found guilty of sexually assaulting female inmates. In August, one of those women filed a federal lawsuit, alleging that the sexual abuse she experienced was the result of “deliberate indifference to the rights and safety of inmates” by the prison’s staff and leadership.
The case’s most recent filings pointed to a 2023 federal audit that found surveillance camera blind spots within the facility and an incomplete investigation into staff-on-inmate sexual abuse allegations, among other deficiencies. 
The Wyoming Attorney General’s office is seeking to dismiss the case. 
Fashion statements 
Several members of the Wyoming Freedom Caucus wore red blazers on Wednesday of both weeks to make a statement, but clarified their fashion choices had no connection to Monarchists’ decision to wear red during the American Revolution.
“It’s about public awareness, in particular, that we are headed for a fiscal issue. Red being ‘in the red’,” House Appropriations Chairman John Bear, R-Gillette, said on the first occasion, pointing to a Legislative Service Office long-term forecast.
Sen. Mike Gierau, D-Jackson, thanked Bear for the clarification. 
“I thought, frankly, that you were just highlighting the new PBS series from Ken Burns on the American Revolution,” Gierau said. “Last night we opened up a big can of whoop ass on people that wore red coats at Yorktown. So I just thought that’s what it was all about. But thanks for straightening me out.” 
To add to the confusion, Rep. Trey Sherwood, D-Laramie, was also wearing red hues that day, but as Wyoming Public Radio reported, Sherwood’s fashion choices were a reference to the movie “Mean Girls,” wherein the main characters wear pink on Wednesdays. 
What’s next?
The committee will reconvene for two weeks in January. The first week will involve the remaining budget presentations. Lawmakers will begin to make decisions on the committee’s proposed budget bill in the second week. 
State financial forecasters will also present lawmakers with an updated report at that time.

Naugton's primary coal provider, the adjacent Kemmerer mine, indicates it will soldier on despite losing its chief customer.
The post Kemmerer power plant’s coal-to-natural-gas conversion highlights uncertainty for Wyoming communities appeared first on WyoFile .","The last two coal-burning units at the Naughton power plant near Kemmerer are scheduled to go dark this month so crews can retool them to burn natural gas instead. A third coal-burning unit at the plant was switched to natural gas in 2020.
The power plant’s majority owner and operator, Rocky Mountain Power, determined that a $12.1 million expenditure to convert the two remaining coal units “was the least-cost, least-risk option for the company and its customers,” according to documents filed with the state.
“Coal operations are scheduled to cease on December 31, 2025 and natural gas operations are anticipated to commence in the spring of next year,” Rocky Mountain Power Senior Communications Specialist Jona Whitesides told WyoFile via email. The power plant employs 108 workers, according to Whitesides. “We don’t anticipate any layoffs as a result of the conversion to natural gas,” he said.
Naughton’s conversion is part of a larger trend. Rocky Mountain Power, a division of PacifiCorp, converted two of four coal-burning units at the Jim Bridger power plant outside Rock Springs to natural gas in 2024. The utility had planned on retiring two of four coal-burning units at the Dave Johnston plant outside Glenrock, but now intends to convert those units to natural gas in 2029, according to its most recent planning documents.

Naughton has been generating electricity since 1963, relying on the nearby Kemmerer coal mine, now operated by Kemmerer Operations LLC. Changes at Naughton, and what it might mean for the Kemmerer coal mine — frequently described by locals as an economic “lifeblood” — have been a source of anxiety for the Kemmerer and Diamondville communities. 
The mine has shed about a third of its workforce in recent years, from 272 employees in 2019 to about 176 this year, according to federal data. Annual coal production has slipped from 3 million tons in 2019 to 2.4 million tons in 2024. The mine shipped about 1.1 million tons during the first three quarters of this year. Nearly half that volume went to Naughton.
Despite the loss of Naughton as a primary coal customer, Kemmerer Operations intends to continue business as usual and has no planned operational changes to report, according to the mine. 
Declining coal and revenue
The Kemmerer mine has slogged through some hard times in recent years, including a 2018 bankruptcy filing by a previous owner, Westmoreland Coal Co., and a precipitous downsizing of workforce, including layoffs in March that cut 28 workers. 
The mine serves other customers, according to local officials, including some soda ash operations near Green River. It’s unclear what other contracts the mine serves.

Despite what the future might hold for the mine, some local officials remain hopeful that Trump administration policies, as well as data center demand and new overseas market opportunities, may set the mine on the road to a comeback. Though Oregon and Washington have been cutting their use of coal, those states are “in a panic” due to recent grid reliability issues, asserted Kent Connelly, chair of the Lincoln County Board of Commissioners.
“Coal is still the cheapest and still the cleanest” fuel for utilities, Connelly told WyoFile. “Coal — it’s what pays the taxes in Wyoming.”
Though the coal industry’s outlook may improve, Naughton’s conversion away from the fuel is sure to sap local revenues, Connelly said. After the first Naughton unit was switched to natural gas in 2020, Lincoln County lost about $3 million in annual tax revenue, mostly due to decreased severance tax on lost coal production at the Kemmerer coal mine, he said.
“Going to natural gas will drop our revenue significantly,” Connolly said, adding that he holds out hope that Naughton may switch back to coal one day. “You’re seeing coal-fired power plants resurrected all over the United States right now.”
The legacy coal industry isn’t the only source of change in Kemmerer. Natural gas processing plants in the region have expanded and Lincoln County will soon be home to the $4 billion Natrium nuclear power plant now under construction.
The nuclear and natural gas expansions, as well as other potential industrial projects, provide some sense of security regarding jobs, local officials say. But whatever permanent tax revenue the Natrium plant might bring remains to be seen.
“The new power plant [Natrium] could offset [revenue losses from the mine] but it doesn’t start up until 2030 or 2031,” Connelly said.

(FS Productions/Getty Images)In Idaho, doctors and a flurry of health care services contribute billions to the state’s economy, a new economic report found.
Commissioned by the Idaho Medical Association and the Idaho Coalition for Safe Healthcare Foundation, the report comes weeks before the Idaho Legislature will convene for the 2026 session. And the report’s findings could come in handy for some policy debates in the Statehouse, as state lawmakers will likely resume heated talks about how medical education can help alleviate the state’s severe doctor shortage. 
“We just thought this was a great opportunity at this moment, especially as our state Legislature has been talking about the physician workforce and what does it take to maintain and grow what we have,” Idaho Medical Association CEO Susie Keller told the Idaho Capital Sun in an interview. “And so having this kind of information, I think, really shows what a worthwhile investment it is for the state of Idaho to put state dollars into funding residency training, for instance.”
This spring, after blowback over a bill that could have ended Idaho’s partnership with the University of Washington Medical school through WWAMI, the Legislature passed a bill to direct the state to explore adding more state-funded seats for Idaho students in other programs.

 Key takeaway is ‘physicians matter,’ economist says 

Services by doctors alone contributed $2.3 billion in output or sales, out of the health care sector’s $10.4 billion overall economic activity in the state, according to the report by University of Idaho economist Steven Peterson. 
The key takeaway from the study is that “physicians matter,” Peterson told the Sun in an interview. 
“They matter two ways. One is they make us healthier, or help heal us from our ailments,” he said. “But the other part of this — and I don’t know that people fully realize — is how important the offices and the services they offer are a part of the regional economy.”
Each year, a doctor in Idaho generates $1.34 million in economic activity, and generates more than $46,000 in state and local taxes, the report found. 
 Report’s data suggests state’s abortion ban loses $125M from economy each year, group says

And the report’s data might even illustrate the economic costs of the state’s strict abortion ban, one group says. 
Doctors left Idaho after abortion ban, study confirms

In a news release, the Idaho Coalition for Safe Healthcare Foundation said the report delivered data to suggest that “the loss of obstetric providers due to the state’s near-total abortion ban is draining more than $125 million a year from the economy.” 
The report itself doesn’t say that. But Idaho Coalition for Safe Healthcare Executive Director Amber Nelson said the group generated that figure by applying the economic impact of each individual physician, which the study pegged at $1.34 million annually, and across the 94 OB-GYNs who left Idaho since the state’s abortion ban took effect, based on a finding from a peer-reviewed study published earlier this year. 
“We’re hoping that this report will provide the Legislature with the information that can help them as they look at policy issues, policy decisions, votes around things such as medical education, legalizing safe, evidence-based healthcare and really working from a policy perspective to make Idaho a more hospitable place for physicians to practice medicine,” Nelson told the Sun in an interview.

The $3.5 million comes from the Wildfire Resilience Investment Program, a state-funded initiative for electric utility projects that is designed to protect against wildfires, the Idaho Governor’s Office of Energy and Mineral Resources announced in a press release issued Wednesday.
Officials selected eight electric utility projects from across the state for the program, with work scheduled to begin in 2026 and expected to finish in late 2027.
The projects selected to receive funding through the Wildfire Resilience Investment Program include:

Clearwater Power Company: Install fire-resistant mesh wrap on 2,150 wooden poles in Clearwater, Latah, and Nez Perce counties.


Idaho County Light and Power Company: Expand the utility right of way and reduce vegetation in Lewis and Idaho counties.


Idaho Power Company: Underground power lines within and near Ponderosa State Park in Valley County.
Inland Power and Light Company: Install weather stations to monitor wildfire conditions and reduce fuel loads in Bonner County.


Kootenai Electric Cooperative: Install modernized, customizable distribution reclosers for more effective grid control, monitoring and wildfire response in Kootenai County.


Lost River Electric Cooperative: Install fire-resistant mesh wrap and avian deterrence devices on power poles, and reduce fuel load in Butte and Custer counties.


Northern Lights, Inc.: Install weather and line monitors to create a daily situational awareness tool to monitor wildfire conditions, and conduct drone vegetation analysis for fuel reduction efforts in Kootenai, Bonner and Boundary counties.


PacifiCorp/Rocky Mountain Power: Upgrade substation grid monitoring and controls for more effective wildfire response in Madison County.

In Wednesday’s press release, officials with the Idaho Governor’s Office of Energy and Mineral Resources said the program aligns with the 2024 Wildfire Report Recommendations that Gov. Brad Little presented in 2024.  
The new Wildfire Resilience Investment Program is the latest iteration of the Idaho Governor’s Office of Energy and Mineral Resources’ Energy Resiliency Grant Program, officials said. An early project from the program included providing the Salmon River Electric Cooperative with a grant to install fire-resistant mesh wraps on wooden utility poles. State officials said those fire resistant wraps protected the wooden poles from wildfire and allowed the electric cooperative to continue providing electric service to the city of Stanley during the 2024 wildfire season.",https://idahocapitalsun.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/456463632_122133939050298243_6648874096772827471_n-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-15 06:56:29.247423

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Over the past few years, North Carolina has become one of the nation’s leading states for solar energy development and investment. Solar industry advocates are fighting to keep it that way despite cuts to renewable energy initiatives at the federal level.
At the end of 2025, the state’s solar sector finds itself facing headwinds from federal policy changes and tariffs, but seeing new growth opportunities in advances in storage technology and rising demand for distributed power sources, especially in rural areas.
The Tar Heel State ranks fifth for total installed solar capacity, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, which values the state’s solar market at $14.4 billion.
Solar installations are split into three categories: residential, commercial, and utility, which refers to larger-scale projects.
Matt Abele, executive director of the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association, says much of the state’s solar capacity to date is deployed in utility-scale projects. “But over the past couple of years,” Abele added, “we’ve seen really, really strong growth in the residential solar sector.”
There were about 7,500 solar jobs in North Carolina as of the third quarter in 2025, SEIA found, putting the state at 11th in the country. These workers are employed by 253 solar companies, producing and installing enough solar technology to power about 1.1 million homes across the state.
The sector has grown since 2024, when there were about 7,356 solar jobs at 224 solar companies in the state, according to SEIA.
Over the past year, however, President Donald Trump has sought to undo initiatives related to renewable energy and the environment.
“President Trump is committed to unleashing American energy and preventing American taxpayers from funding expensive and unreliable energy policies from the Green New Scam,” the White House said in July.
The “Big, Beautiful Bill” signed by Trump in July eliminated a 30% residential solar tax credit for systems installed after 2025, dramatically shortening the timeline provided by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which would have provided the 30% tax credit through 2032.
The sudden change has led to a very busy autumn for the residential side of the industry, but an uncertain future in 2026.
Abele said most solar installers across the state were fully booked up by early September because there was so much demand from new customers wanting to collect the tax credit. He said installing a residential system usually takes between eight to 12 weeks, due to procedural steps like utility interconnection and permitting.
“You’re seeing a mad dash right now to get projects moving,” Abele said, “trying to expedite the deployment of projects that are already in the pipeline and making sure those projects are completed prior to those tax credits expiring.”
At the utility-scale level, tax credits for larger projects remain available through 2027.
Chris Carmody, executive director at Carolinas Clean Energy Business Association, said he tends to describe the industry as “solar plus storage,” because for larger projects, systems using solar are built with storage.
This means utilities are able to deposit the energy and dispatch it when needed — such as at night, during cloudy conditions, or when gas prices are particularly high.
“The arrival of major storage investment is something that has kept solar pretty healthy in North Carolina, despite tough trends from Washington, DC,” Carmody said.
Tax changes aren’t the only challenge facing the solar market. Tariffs on foreign goods imposed by the Trump administration have also led to higher costs for potential solar consumers.
Along with imposing tariffs on different countries that make solar panels — including China, which dominates the global market — the Trump administration also implemented a 50% tariff on imported steel.
“That affects every kind of energy, so solar, gas plants, and gas pipelines,” Carmody said. “It makes anything that requires steel as a building material much, much more expensive.”
North Carolina is already seeing the effects of these changes.
Pine Gate Renewables, a utility-scale solar and energy storage developer based in Asheville, closed its plant and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November. The company laid off more than 78% of its workforce, impacting 223 people in Buncombe County, WLOS reported.
Carmody said many other companies are cutting back their workforce in general due to uncertainty about future federal policy.
“In addition to being really sad for these employees, it’s an indicator that makes people nervous about investing in this environment,” Carmody said.
In August, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency abruptly ended the Solar for All program, a Biden-era initiative awarding $7 billion in grants nationally. Through this, North Carolina would receive $156 million towards projects like rooftop solar and community solar gardens for more than 900,000 lower-income households.
Projects using the program’s funding were set to start in fall 2025.
Attorney General Jeff Jackson joined representatives of 22 other states and the District of Columbia in an October lawsuit against the EPA. The plaintiffs claim the cancellation of the Solar for All program was illegal.
Steve Kalland, executive director of the North Carolina Clean Energy Technology Center, had been working on developing a contractor registration list for the program.
“We saw this as a potentially really valuable program, and we remain hopeful that things will proceed to a point where it’s allowed to move forward again,” Kalland said. “We’re doing our best to find other ways to help the citizens of North Carolina that are interested in utilizing clean energy resources.”
This includes training people who want to be involved in installation and providing support to businesses looking to use renewable technologies.
Kalland acknowledges the state’s solar industry is facing a period of change, but he remains optimistic. Despite the loss of federal funding, he says, there’s still a growing demand for distributed solar energy resources.
The center has partnered with organizations providing resources to western North Carolina in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, as well as parts of eastern North Carolina that have been affected over the years by natural disasters, leading to similar needs for energy.
“There is a lot of effort right now to try and figure out how we can keep solar as affordable as possible,” he said. “Folks still see the value in these technologies, and we’ll continue to see them move forward.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/solar-panels.jpg,,,2025-12-15 06:56:29.247423

Yet the entries shed little light on the vast majority of immigration arrests in Tennessee since President Donald Trump retook office in January with a pledge to conduct mass deportations.
Tennessee has among the highest rates of ICE arrests in the nation, according to an analysis of federal data by the Prison Policy Initiative. 
Between May and October, more than 6,200 people in Tennessee were taken into custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the analysis found. Only Texas, Virginia, Washington, DC, Florida, Arizona, Oklahoma and Utah had higher ICE arrest rates.
Hundreds of immigration arrests have taken place in Memphis as part of the Memphis Safe Task Force, but the exact number has not been publicly disclosed.  
Established in September by President Donald Trump, the task force includes 1,000 federal law enforcement officers, among them Border Patrol and ICE agents.
The task force has made more than 3,842 total arrests in Shelby County as of Dec. 11, according to the U.S. Marshals, which initially released numbers on immigration arrests but has since declined to do so. In its initial release, data provided showed 1 in five arrests by the task force were immigration violations.










I’m taking on as much risk as I can by trying to enforce the provisions of the constitution so that we’re all protected through the lawsuit that I have right now against Bill Lee. 


– Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris


The federal government has thus far declined to publicly release names, charges and demographic information about the majority of individuals arrested in Memphis.
Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris said all task force arrest information, including names, mugshots and charges, is compiled and provided to his office daily by federal officials, but he could not share it.
“I’m constrained,” Harris said. “I mean, Donald Trump and a lot of federal officials have made it very clear through their very public actions that they are willing to investigate and to arrest or indict, and in some cases threaten incarceration, for people they believe are their enemies.”
Harris said he believes the information should be made public but declined to do so, citing the risk of retaliation to him, personally.
The daily update provided to Harris is marked “sensitive information,” he said.
Tennessee, feds provide few details on cost, arrests three weeks into Memphis task force

“Federal officials have marked it as sensitive,” Harris said. “It clearly is not. But based on their previous actions they seem willing to do whatsoever to who they perceive as their enemies, including investigations and indictments.”
“I’m taking on as much risk as I can by trying to enforce the provisions of the constitution so that we’re all protected through the lawsuit that I have right now against Bill Lee. I don’t know how much more risk I can take,” Lee said.
The Department of Homeland Security “worst of the worst” database lists fewer than 40 arrests of immigrants with serious criminal records in Memphis. More than 160 immigration related arrests were reported by the Task Force in October, before it ceased sharing immigration related enforcement data.
A majority of the posts on the website, which each contain social media buttons to easily share individual mugshots, do not list a date of arrest nor detail whether individuals had already been in the state’s jails and prisons before being arrested for immigration crimes by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE.

(Photo by Maya Smith/For Kansas Reflector)The North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services is reducing some of its child care subsidies for working families as the program faces an unexpected $35.5 million funding deficit.
The state set aside $124.7 million for the program for the 2025-2027 budget cycle. Due to increased enrollment, however, the department now anticipates needing $160.2 million to carry it through June 2027.
The program serves working families with kids up to age 13 and some children with special needs up to age 19. Families with parents in school or training, or those seeking employment or education may also be eligible.
To cover the shortfall, the state plans to lower the maximum amount of assistance it provides to households enrolled in the program seeking child care for children older than age 3. These changes can be viewed on the Department of Health and Services’ website.
Donna Aukland, chief financial officer for the Department of Health and Human Services, told lawmakers during a Wednesday committee meeting the estimated maximum impact to families is $100 more a month in child care costs.
The average child care benefit for those enrolled in the program is $730 per month. 
The rise in enrollment is primarily driven by the state’s new Child Care Workforce Benefit program, which was implemented in summer 2024, said Michele Gee, the agency’s economic assistance director. 
The program — which subsidizes child care costs for people who themselves work in child care — is more popular than the Department of Health and Human Services expected, she said. 
“When we were actually building our budget for the 25-27 biennium, we were anticipating about 6,400 children per month,” Gee said. “We’re right now serving about 7,600 children per month.”
Aukland said she wants the agency to have up-to-date child care data when making budgeting decisions going forward.
On Dec. 1, the Department of Health and Human Services closed the Child Care Assistance Program to new enrollees and implemented a waitlist for families who wish to participate. Low-income families are given the highest priority for open spots.
As of Thursday, seven families were wait-listed, the agency said.
The Department of Health and Human Services is also reducing incentive bonuses for high-performing participants in Bright & Early ND, a state program that assesses the quality of early childhood services.
The program has four levels of certification. To incentivize participants to improve their rating, providers ranked in the three highest tiers currently receive bonuses. The program will start limiting bonuses to the top two tiers starting Jan. 1.
The Department of Health and Human Services said the changes will save it $13.2 million for the 2025-2027 biennium.

The department will use $22.3 million of the state’s federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families grant to cover the rest of the funding deficit, Aukland said. The state receives $26.4 million per year from the program, and can set aside 30% of that annual funding to support child care subsidies.
The state will be using money from its 2025, 2026 and 2027 Temporary Assistance for Needy Families grants to cover the shortfall.
Sen. Kyle Davison, R-Fargo, during Wednesday’s meeting asked for more details about how the state has used Temporary Assistance for Needy Families grant money over the past few years. 
“The reality is there’s $22 million dollars that isn’t going to somewhere else,” Davison said.
Aukland said some of the grant dollars had been budgeted but not needed. It’s also tapping into money it had previously left on the table, since the program has specific rules about how the money can be used, she said.
Sen. Jeff Magrum, R- Hazelton, asked Aukland why the Department of Health and Human Services didn’t seek more funding from the North Dakota Emergency Commission. He questioned whether this could have allowed the agency to sustain the program without needing to reduce benefits.
“Some people are losing their bonuses now, and some families will have to ante up more,” he said.
Aukland said she’s not sure the Emergency Commission would have had enough contingency funding to cover the program’s deficit.
During a meeting last week, Senate Minority Leader Sen. Kathy Hogan, D-Fargo, said she appreciated the department’s honesty about the budget shortfall.
“We’re going to see major child care cuts,” Hogan said. “It’s all concerning because we’re already in a child care crisis and this is going to create more.”
North Dakota’s Legislature has invested in supporting child care as a way to combat a severe workforce shortage.
Hogan said the program’s budget shortfall could be addressed during the Legislature’s planned special session in January.
“I think we should’ve been monitoring that budget situation more closely,” she said.

“This rule will actually allow you to bring back the 1970s station wagon—maybe a little wood paneling on the side,” Duffy said in a CNBC interview. “We can bring back choice to consumers, so yeah, the minivan is awesome, but maybe the station wagon is cool, too.”
If visions of Clark Griswold’s Wagon Queen Family Truckster from “National Lampoon’s Vacation” danced in your head, you’re not alone.
Earlier this month, the Transportation Department’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it intends to roll back the average fuel economy standard to 34.1 miles per gallon by 2031 from 50.4 mph by 2031 under President Joe Biden’s plan.
President Donald Trump and other administration officials have long complained that the Biden targets would have resulted in automakers having to switch almost completely to electric vehicle production.

The administration says rolling back fuel economy standards will lower the price of a new vehicle by an average $1,000 and improve highway safety because more people will be able to afford new cars with the latest technologies.
Experts say these claims are malarky. There are a variety of reasons why vehicle prices have zoomed in recent years, including supply chain shortages, rising sales of pricy pickups and SUVs and Trump’s tariffs on car parts, steel and aluminum.
“The average price of a new vehicle remains near $50,000, with no indication of softening,” said Erin Keating, executive analyst at Cox Automotive.
Environmental groups say the new fuel economy rules, if approved, will make the air dirtier and raise gas prices as demand increases.
Detroit’s automakers, which have been whipsawed between Biden’s electric-vehicle focus and the Trump administration’s seeming desire to bring back your father’s Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser, praised the proposed fuel economy rollbacks.
Using a phrase Trump often employs, Ford Motor Co. CEO Jim Farley said the plan to slash fuel economy standards is “common sense” and will improve affordability of the automaker’s most popular vehicles, which are expensive full-size pickup trucks and SUVs.
The Detroit Three’s support for the new Trump fuel economy standards is understandable from a pure profit standpoint. Electric vehicle sales growth has lagged far below expectations because of high EV prices and an inadequate battery-charging infrastructure.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Trump has done his best to kill the electric car. His administration and Congress earlier this year eliminated the $7,500 EV purchase tax credit, designed to aid the transition to clean transportation. EV sales plummeted when the credit expired September 30.
The president also temporarily froze funds approved by Congress to help states install more EV charging stations, but a judge forced the administration to release the money in June.
Alan Baum, a West Bloomfield-based auto industry analyst, said slashing fuel economy standards would likely balloon the bottom lines of Ford, General Motors and Stellantis.
“It gives them the opportunity to focus on their most profitable products and most profitability geography,” Baum said, meaning big pickups and SUVs in the U.S. market.
Stellantis, which has recently struggled in North America and lagged other automakers in building EVs, is ecstatic about the prospect of being able to build more gas-guzzling Jeeps and Ram trucks.
“It’s a great day for us at Stellantis,” new Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa said during a ceremony in the Oval Office where Trump announced the proposed rollback.
But Baum said the Detroit Three could be putting their companies at “extreme risk” if they largely abandon investment in EVs. Fuel economy regulations could change again under the next president. And foreign, global automakers that are dealing with strong EV mandates in other countries, could leapfrog Detroit in a coming EV world.
“EV costs will decline and the infrastructure will improve,” Baum said. “Other companies will take that mantle.”
Farley and GM CEO Mary Barra have said they remain committed to offer a broad range of EVs to consumers.  EVs remain GM’s “North Star,” Barra said in September.
While they’re happy at the likely prospect of lower fuel economy standards, automakers continue to get mixed regulatory signals from the administration.
Dogged by an affordability crisis, Trump told automakers that he wants them to build tiny, inexpensive kei cars like he saw on a recent trip to Japan. This mandate came shortly after he said he was freeing them to build more gas-guzzling pickups and SUVs.
Experts say kei cars would be nearly impossible to sell here because they don’t meet U.S. safety-related regulations. But Trump said he has cleared them for production and is demanding that automakers manufacture them domestically.
“START BUILDING THEM NOW!” Trump shouted on Truth Social, while making the dubious claim that automakers “have long wanted to do this.”
The Car-Guy-in-Chief also might be softening his opposition to EVs, noting that the tiny Trumpmobiles could be “propelled by gasoline, electric or hybrid.”
Detroit automakers have a long history of not commenting on speculation about upcoming vehicles, but I doubt they have Wagon Queen Family Trucksters or kei cars in their future product plans.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-72890694-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-15 06:56:29.247423

This story was produced by Tennessee Lookout and WPLN News, with support from the Pulitzer Center and the Education Writers Association. 
Less than two months after Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in 1968, a Black law student in Nashville named Rita Geier set off a series of events that ultimately reshaped higher education in Tennessee and around the country. 
Geier was attending Vanderbilt University in Nashville, clerking for white Civil Rights lawyer George Barrett and teaching a class across town at Tennessee State University, which was called Tennessee A&I at the time. The school is the state’s only historically Black public university.
Even though Brown v. Board of Education had been decided more than a decade ago, it was obvious to Geier that this public, mostly Black school was still being treated like a second-class institution.
“Tennessee State, at that time, was very dilapidated,” she said. “I, of course, was a law student and was learning all about civil rights and the legal remedies that were possible, and it didn’t take long for us to see there was a tool that could be used. And I was the perfect plaintiff.”
Together, Geier and Barrett crafted a legal complaint. They said that the state of Tennessee wasn’t giving TSU enough money — for its salaries, its library, its buildings — because it was a predominantly Black university.
“I mean, the motivation was to get more resources and equal facilities,” she said. “Maybe I was naive. But I really believed in the law.”
Almost every Southern state would go on to have its own version of the Geier case, battling over the desegregation of higher education. (The Mississippi case even went before the U.S. Supreme Court.) 
But the Geier case in Tennessee was the longest-running lawsuit on this topic in the entire country. It lasted for 38 years, from 1968 to 2006. Ultimately, the name itself — Geier — became a shorthand for the state’s efforts to increase diversity at its public universities. 
And along the way, it led to a series of dramatic and often contentious events that changed the trajectory of higher education in Tennessee, including the unprecedented merger of UT Nashville and Tennessee State University.
The general of the war
Today, Tennessee State University has two campuses: the main campus on Jefferson Street, and an auxiliary property downtown called the Avon Williams Campus.
But back in the late 1960s and 1970s, this property belonged to the University of Tennessee. UT Nashville had started as a night school, but was quickly expanding into a full-fledged university campus. 
In Geier’s original complaint, she took aim at UT’s expansion, arguing that it was perpetuating a “dual system of higher education” in Nashville. How could a historically marginalized university, already struggling with poor state funding, compete with this growing campus within the same city? 
Report: State cost TSU tens of millions in land grant funding

The state defended the expansion by arguing that the two universities could coexist, especially if they offered different programs.
And the state’s position seemed to be gaining traction — until it hired a new president of TSU in 1974: a tall, burly man named Frederick Humphries. 
Humphries was 39 years old, a chemistry professor by training, and he’d never been a college president before. 
“They thought they were going to run him over,” said Humphries’ son, Laurence. “And it turned out to be quite the opposite.”
Almost immediately, Humphries started to chafe against the state’s position in the Geier case. He said in an interview with The Tennessean, right after he was hired, that the state’s plan to have two universities in Nashville wasn’t going to work, and that TSU should be the only public university in Nashville.
Humphries publicly challenged the chancellor on his support for TSU during his first meeting with the state Board of Regents. Humphries later told a colleague at TSU, George Pruitt, that two of the top officials from the board followed him into the bathroom after the meeting and threatened to fire him if he didn’t step in line. 
“And I’ll never forget what Fred said,” Pruitt recalled. “He said, ‘Well, I got a problem. If I do what you ask me to do, I’m going to sell out the institution that I head. I’m going to sell out its history and tradition, and I’m going to sell out the interest of Black people in the state and all over the country. If I’m true to those things, you’re going to fire me. 
“So given the choices, I’d rather take the consequences.”
TSU in the crosshairs
Humphries made the same argument when he testified in court in the fall of 1976, as part of the Geier case. Remarkably, the judge in that case agreed with him — and ordered the merger of UT Nashville into TSU. It was immediately appealed.
Meanwhile, the pressure on Humphries kept coming.
“They started investigating the hell out of us,” Pruitt said. “We had some deficits because they had been starving the institution’s resources for years, and we had some real challenges.”
Pruitt, who served as TSU’s vice president of student affairs, remembers a yearslong controversy involving its student enrollment computer system, which crashed in 1976. TSU had to calculate students’ cumulative GPAs by hand, and temporarily stopped flunking out students. It was then accused of padding its enrollment numbers. 










Someone threw a brick through my sister’s window. We used to have to have security outside sitting in the back of the house and in the front of the house. I mean this was full-on Mississippi Burning type stuff.


– Laurence Humphries


In 1977, that issue was used as a reason to put Humphries on probation, although Pruitt said he believes the probation was actually the state’s retaliation for testifying in favor of the merger.
Then, in the winter of 1978, the heat went out on TSU’s campus while thousands of students were in the dorms.
“They tried to say that was because of the college’s incompetence, but the university documented it had been requesting for years funding to replace and service an outdated heating plant,” Pruitt said. “And the funds had been denied.”
Humphries, Pruitt and their teams were dealing with this while they were also running a university with thousands of students.
“When I say we were literally working 24 hours a day, seven days a week, it was true. I remember on Christmas, I opened up presents with my daughter and went to work on Christmas Day,” Pruitt said. “We knew we were at war. We knew that our jobs were at stake. We knew that if we lost, we were all gonna get fired. We even knew what the odds were — they were not with us. But we didn’t care.”
Laurence Humphries was in grade school at the time, but he also remembers the tension. 
“There were nights where people would call and hang up. Someone threw a brick through my sister’s window. We used to have to have security outside sitting in the back of the house and in the front of the house. I mean this was full-on Mississippi Burning type stuff,” he said.
When his mother wrote a check that bounced, Laurence said, his father was furious. 
“He told my mom, ‘This can’t happen to us. … We can’t make a mistake. They’re looking for a pretense to fire me,’” Laurence said. “‘I have to be above reproach, which means my family has to be above reproach.’”

‘Truth and justice and the American way’
In 1979, the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals came out with a ruling agreeing with the district judge: In order to achieve desegregation, it said, the state couldn’t have two universities with such divided racial demographics in the same city. So the state should keep TSU and fold this new university, UT Nashville, into it.
“That had never happened before in the history of this country,” Pruitt said. “In every other case, a court-ordered desegregation merger meant you shut down the Black school and send the Black kids to the white school. But this was the first time at any level where the Black institution survived.”
To this day, many people consider this to be the moment when TSU was saved from extinction. It would get a downtown campus, all of the UT Nashville faculty and students, and — most importantly — the resources and respect that came with being the premiere public university in the state capital. 
“For one brief shining moment, the good guys won,” Pruitt said. “There was truth and justice and the American way.”
Laurence Humphries remembers the celebration, too. “My father thought he was going to be at Tennessee State the rest of his career,” he said. 
But the celebration didn’t last very long, he said. “ He didn’t realize that five years later, the culture and environment of Nashville and the university was so toxic for him that he would have to leave.”

(Photo by Caity Coyne/West Virginia Watch)The West Virginia First Foundation will allocate “nearly” $18 million in coming weeks to organizations and projects meant to alleviate harms from the state’s ongoing drug and overdose epidemic, according to a press release from the organization.
The First Foundation made the announcement at its annual meeting on Thursday. Details for the money being distributed and recipients for that money will not be made available until “all documentation is completed,” per a news release. Those receiving money and those who applied should be notified about their status by the end of this year. 
The grants being given this year are part of the private nonprofit’s “Momentum Initiative Grant Process.” Last year, the organization — which was formed by the Legislature in 2023 to disburse the state’s share of funds from litigation against drug manufacturers and distributors — made $19.2 million available as part of its “Initial Opportunity Grant” cycle. 
While the nonprofit received about 174 requests for those funds, only about $10.4 million was actually distributed at first due to issues with those applications. In March, the First Foundation allocated an additional $6.2 million as a supplement to that inaugural grant cycle. 
The Initial Opportunity Grant cycle saw 94 projects funded throughout the Mountain State, including to existing recovery centers, youth services, police departments and more.
The newest round of funding is structured to prioritize one “statewide target area” — which is projects targeted toward supporting those in foster care and non-parental caregivers — and four regional target areas. The regional focuses are: youth prevention, recovery housing, behavioral health and workforce development projects and day report programs. 
The money being disbursed by the First Foundation is separate from funds being allocated through local governments, which receive their own portion of funding from settlements. Between July 1, 2023 and June 30, 2024 — the timeframe covered by reports submitted from local governments — municipalities and counties in West Virginia received about $72.8 million in settlement funds.
Through that same time, about $6.9 million — roughly 9.4% of all money received — was spent by local governments.
The largest spending category for localities in Fiscal Year 2024 was for law enforcement efforts, which received about $3.64 million of all money spent. That totaled about 52.8% of funds allocated locally that fiscal year. 
Also at Thursday’s board meeting, the First Foundation re-elected its officers for the 2026 term. Greg Duckworth, a former state trooper and current Raleigh County commissioner, was elected to serve as chair of the board. Duckworth has been serving as interim chair since September, when the inaugural chairman, Matt Harvey, stepped down after being nominated by President Donald Trump to serve as the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of West Virginia. Harvey was confirmed by Congress for that position in October.
Other officers on the First Foundation board remained unchanged and are as follows:

Vice-chair: Dr. Matthew Christiansen, who previously worked as the state health officer and the commissioner for the Bureau for Public Health
Treasurer: Jeff Sandy, the former cabinet secretary for the state Department of Homeland Security
Secretary: Dora Stutler, Harrison County Schools superintendent
Executive board member: Alys Smith, a philanthropist and attorney who is married to Marshall University President Brad Smith.

(Photo by Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)State-owned minerals are projected to generate $8.4 billion in future oil and gas royalties over the life of North Dakota oil production, benefiting K-12 education, according to an annual analysis. 
The projected royalties’ benefit to the Common Schools Trust Fund, as well as emerging innovations in the industry driving productivity despite low oil prices, are positive trends for state officials who received the update last week. 
“This is always my favorite board meeting,” said Michael Howe, North Dakota secretary of state and a member of the Board of University and School Lands. “It makes me excited for the future.”
Joel Brown with Mineral Tracker, a subsidiary of First International Bank and Trust that performed the analysis, said he observed several promising developments in the oil and gas industry.

“We’ve seen a lot of really positive things as far as operators reaching into new areas where they hadn’t previously been drilling, accelerating development of areas that prior wouldn’t have been drilled before,” Brown said.
North Dakota collected $455 million in oil and gas royalties on state-owned minerals in fiscal year 2025. Royalties are generated based on a percentage of production from wells the state has an interest in. 
That revenue is deposited in trusts managed by the Department of Trust Lands, with oversight from the Board of University and School Lands, that are invested and used for specific purposes. 
The largest trust is the Common Schools Trust Fund, which is used to support K-12 education. The fund will disburse $585 million during the 2025-27 biennium, which will account for 24% of the state’s share of per-student education funding. 
The Common Schools Trust Fund is valued at $7.94 billion, an increase from $7 billion at the end of the previous fiscal year. 
“That is very nice growth year over year,” said Joseph Heringer, land commissioner. “Almost a billion dollars of growth.”
Mineral Tracker estimates the value of the state’s minerals to be $2.17 billion at this time. This marks the third year in a row the value has decreased. But Brown said there is a “very strong correlation” between the minerals’ value and the price of oil. 
“We saw a 12% decrease in value from last year,” Brown said. “That was largely just related to oil prices.”
The value of the minerals will naturally decrease over time as more oil is extracted, leaving less and less remaining in the ground. 
“These reserves are being liquidated each day as the wells continue to produce and generate royalties,” Brown said. 
Neither the valuation or the projected royalties factor in the potential for further technology improvements such as enhanced oil recovery. Some projections suggest that technology could enable additional oil production equal to everything that has been extracted from the Bakken since the 2000s, Brown said.
“The size of the prize is very significant,” he said.

We have a shortage of places they can afford to live.
After years of working alongside cities, builders, and families across North Idaho, especially in Kootenai County, I’ve seen that our housing crisis isn’t driven by a lack of interest or investment. Rather, outdated zoning rules and regulatory red tape make starter homes and “middle housing” nearly impossible to build in our communities.
We often hear about “market failure” when it comes to housing, but what I see in Idaho, at the state level and in our cities and towns, is a policy failure. Our zoning codes no longer reflect the realities of how Idahoans live, work, and form households today.
Idaho needs a statewide strategy to fix east Idaho’s affordable housing crisis

Most communities use zoning rules created in the 1970s, an era when land was abundant, families were larger, and home prices were attainable for a single-income household. Today, most residential land is still exclusively for large lot, single-family homes. Meanwhile, land and infrastructure costs have surged, especially since COVID, and younger working families need smaller, more attainable options.
Zoning codes in communities like Rathdrum and Hayden effectively ban middle housing on 70-85% of residential land. This would include options like duplexes, triplexes, townhomes, cottage courts, and small multi-unit buildings.
Where these are technically allowed, regulatory hurdles make projects too expensive to pencil. Builders regularly face minimum lot sizes far larger than what’s functionally needed, parking requirements that inflate costs, discretionary review processes that add uncertainty, and design standards that increase expenses. In small and mid-sized cities, these layers of regulation can add years and hundreds of thousands of dollars to what should be straightforward projects.
Where I live in Kootenai County, we have the jobs, the demand, and builders ready to construct starter homes. What we lack is the permission to build the kinds of homes Idahoans can actually afford. Teachers, health care workers, service workers, and young families are priced out, and it’s not because developers refuse to build for them, but because our government regulations prevent it.
Middle housing enhances neighborhood character and helps us welcome new neighbors without sprawl. It’s a way to use existing infrastructure more efficiently, and support local businesses and walkability. These homes are naturally more attainable because they use land more effectively, not because they rely on government subsidies.
Gem State Housing Alliance is the first-of-its-kind housing advocacy organization in Idaho, and has a playbook ready to go to help city and state leaders update zoning regulations in order to facilitate more housing. Policies that would help include:


Reducing lot size minimums,


Allowing duplexes and fourplexes by right;


Offering flexible parking options


Establishing predictable timelines and creating clear pathways for infill housing.


Such policy changes would strengthen local control and align zoning codes with comprehensive plans and long-term community goals. Without action, we risk continuing to erode the economic vitality of our region by pricing out the next generation of hardworking families.
If we want teachers living in the towns where they teach, nurses close to our hospitals, and young families building their futures in Idaho’s growing cities and towns, zoning reform isn’t optional. It’s the surest path to a stable, more prosperous state.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Columbia’s City Council on Thursday advanced a bill that would raise water rates up to 20% per year over the next five years to fund water infrastructure upgrades that the local utility says are necessary for growth and disaster resilience.
The bill passed 4-3 on its first reading, with council members Carl McCullen and Charlie Huffman and Columbia Mayor Chaz Molder voting no. The council also unanimously advanced a bill that would increase the Columbia Power and Water Systems’ impact fee for new customers.
Public hearings for the bills are scheduled for Jan. 8, 2026.
Should the project’s funding plan be approved in January, work would begin in Spring 2026 and complete around summer 2029.
Several elected officials and residents from surrounding areas spoke in opposition to the bill Thursday, urging the council to delay the vote to explore other options or seek a referendum that would allow all affected ratepayers to vote on the proposed increase.
Columbia Power and Water Systems serves 27,000 customers, but also sells water to other nearby water systems in Maury County, Spring Hill and Mount Pleasant, which serve an additional 35,000 customers combined. 
Mike Kuzawinski, who represents District 4 on the Maury County Commission, asked the Columbia City Council to hold a referendum to allow all Columbia Power and Water Systems customers — including those outside the city limits — to have a say.
“This is a vote that is going to affect Spring Hill, Mount Pleasant, Columbia, the outskirts of Maury County here … just the idea of being able to impose such a burden on a resident who you don’t represent — they didn’t vote for you — you have no business voting for that,” Kuzawinski said.
Columbia considers water rate hike of up to 150% over next 5 years for new intake, treatment plant

The procedural route that would be needed for such a referendum is unclear.
The higher impact fee and water rates would allow Columbia’s water utility to secure federal and state low-interest, long-term loans to finance the majority of a new $520 million intake on the Duck River and a new water treatment plant. 
Columbia Power and Water Systems’ current intake withdraws up to 20 million gallons of water per day from the Duck River, a scenic river known for its remarkable biodiversity. 
Drought conditions and population growth are increasingly placing a strain on the natural resource, and Gov. Bill Lee issued an executive order in November 2024 convening an advisory group to determine how to protect the river and serve residents’ water needs. The Duck River Planning Partnership — a collection of public officials, utility representatives and conservationists — issued its first recommendations in November, including a feasibility study for regional water solutions to be completed by August 2026.
Plans for the new intake have been underway for 10 years, and the project has already received approval from the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation and the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency. 
The intake would be moved downstream from the current Riverside Drive location to a spot that would be more drought-resilient and more protective of the river’s ecology, according to Columbia Power and Water Systems President and CEO Jonathan Hardin. The new intake would increase the utility’s withdrawal to up to 32 million gallons of water per day.
Columbia Vice Mayor Randy McBroom, who voted in favor of the bill, said a 20% annual rate hike would be the “ceiling” or  “worst case scenario.” 
Hardin said the federal and state loans require highly conservative stress tests that don’t allow the utility to assume that its customer base will grow and bring in new income from higher new customer impact fees and new ratepayers, but any money that does come in from impact fees and growth will reduce the need to raise rates.
Regional voices push back
State Rep. Scott Cepicky, a Culleoka Republican who has lived in Maury County for more than 20 years, was not convinced. Cepicky attended Thursday’s meeting to express concerns on behalf of himself and others at the state level, he said.
“Is this the best use for half a billion dollars, especially of state and federal money that you’re borrowing? And are you going to be able to repay it?” Cepicky asked, pointing out that Columbia Power and Water Systems may lose business from Maury County Water System, pending the completion of a pipeline under construction from the Cumberland River.
Maury County Mayor Sheila Butt, a member of the Duck River Planning Partnership, entreated the council to postpone their vote until after the regionalization study recommended by the partnership is complete. Should the proposed rate hike pass, her grandson, who was born in July, would likely be paying for this project when he is 25 or 30 years old, Butt said.
“Right now, we have doors opening that have never been opened before, so I’m recommending that you do postpone this vote,” Butt said. “Give the Duck River Planning Partnership an opportunity to finish its work, and if this is the only answer for water, I’ll help you work toward it.”
Trevor Pennington owns a beef cattle farm in Williamsport that feeds about 3,000 families in Maury, Williamson and Davidson counties each month. He buys his water from Maury County Water System, which buys water from Columbia’s utility at wholesale prices and sells it to county customers after tacking on additional costs.
“If this goes through, it’s not just going to put some farmers out of business, it’s going to put a lot of farmers out of business,” Pennington warned.
Dan Allen, Spring Hill’s assistant city administrator and general manager of Spring Hill Water, said he recognized the weight of this decision, particularly when considering long-term water supply challenges. 
“Whatever path you take … we will continue to work with you in good faith,” Allen told the council.
Before the vote, Molder addressed the council and public, reiterating that the project has been “fully vetted and permitted by multiple state and federal agencies” and is “necessary for the sake of our regional water supply.”
But Molder said he could not support the rate increase as proposed by Columbia Power and Water Systems.
“From the beginning, I have raised concerns over the burden being asked of this council to burden future councils and citizens on speculative rate increases that future city councils will have no say (over),” he said.
In a statement to the Lookout Saturday, Molder said it’s clear that elected officials must address the rising cost of living.
“We must work with our state and federal partners to help fund this project in ways that will limit the burden on our citizens,” he said.

Their mission was to illuminate the breadth of services that exist in town, and to connect these to each other and to the public, to ensure no Berean dies of exposure or hunger, or is alone when they need support.
Referred to as, Bereans Helping Bereans, the event was held Dec. 8 at the Acton Folk Center and co-hosted by Mayor Bruce Fraley and the Rev. Kent Gilbert, pastor of Union Church on Prospect Street. Zinnia Hensely, social worker for the Berea Police Department, introduced the panelists and managed their speaking time.
A dozen local service organization leaders each gave a brief presentation about their organization, noting what they do and how they do it, before Gilbert peppered the panelists with questions previously submitted by citizens. That was followed by more questions from the audience of well over 100.
Panelists represented a range of services, including a food bank, emergency housing, health care, student services and employment. Several panelists spoke of how they help those without means or financial literacy, offering material support for rent, medical care and other needs. (For a complete list of participating organizations, see below.)
Lisa Abbott, co-founder of a citizens action group, We Show Up, also was a panelist. Abbott had been removed by force from a recent city council meeting at Fraley’s request, claiming that she had not followed public comment procedure by speaking at length about federal actions orchestrated by the president, something Fraley had said the council had no power to address.
The day after the fracas, Gilbert contacted the mayor to offer help bringing the community together, and to be united in protecting vulnerable neighbors, despite any political differences. After Fraley and Gilbert had begun collaborating on the forum, Fraley invited Abbott to participate in the event. He smiled throughout the duration of her presentation.

Abbott touched upon the same themes as when she’d spoken at the council meeting, largely summarized as the need for citizens and their local governments to protect those targeted or unsupported by the federal government. We Show Up, she said, organizes people to do that, including by raising funds to help other organizations such as the UP Initiative, one of the evening’s featured “one-stop shops” for folks who need a range of services. Abbott also noted how her organization recently donated money to help support two young women, both U.S. citizens, she said, who had been left alone after their father had been deported.
In addition to the dozen leaders on the panel, Fraley also name checked several other human service leaders in the audience, including Katie Heckman, director of Berea Home Village, which allows senior citizens to stay in their homes by offering them supportive services, and Danny Helton, commander of the American Legion Post 50 in Berea, which helps local veterans obtain services they need. Shelbi Pool, founder of the UP Initiative, was also in attendance, as were representatives from multiple other service organizations.
After the panelists had finished speaking, Gilbert asked the audience if they had learned anything new about the range and scope of services in town. About two-thirds of the audience raised their hands.
Berea hosted a forum at the Acton Folk Center Monday night where representatives from 12 nonprofits and state and county agencies spoke briefly about what services they offer to Bereans and how to access them.

“Another possible way we can all be supportive is to make sure people know what is going on,” Gilbert told the audience. “If you know something good, make sure you tell at least three other people.”
Comments and questions from the audience included several pleas to organize and distribute directories of all available services. Others asked for an explanation of what is being done to offer transitional housing, and there was a discussion about affordable housing, which prompted Planning and Zoning Commissioner Martin Richards to come to the microphone and urge citizens to take the city’s land use survey, currently on line, part of the town’s comprehensive planning process, now underway. Affordable housing is among the many topics citizens are urged to weigh in on as part of the planning process, according to Richards.
Whether and where there are cooling and heating centers for folks without air conditioning or heating, was also discussed. Fraley stated that it is a gap in city services, and would be addressed. Tornado shelters, too.
A question about whether it would be possible for the city to offer the option to round up utility bills with the extra cash being donated to charity was discussed, with Fraley praising the creativity, but expressing his doubts it would be possible to direct charity donations from public utility collection. He promised to look into it, however.
Lastly, Gilbert asked about whether Berea police are contracted to offer services to federal Immigration Control and Enforcement officers. Fraley said no. Councilmember Katie Startzman said that ICE is primarily interested in working with counties that have additional space in local detention centers where they can detain those they’ve apprehended.
“So we might not be a county where it would be really easy to do their jobs,” Startzman said, referencing Madison County’s perpetually overcrowded detention center. Her comments were met with murmurs of laughter from the audience.
In addition to Fraley, Hensley, Richards and Startzman, the City was also represented by Councilmen Steve Davis and John Payne. Madison County Magistrate Brian Combs, whose District 2 includes Berea, was also in attendance, as were Berea’s police chief, Jason Hays, and the city administrator, Shawn Sandlin.
Before releasing the audience to visit the tables set up by the various panelists’ respective organizations, Fraley wrapped the discussion portion of the evening with kind words for his fellow citizens.
“This shows you something that I said at the last council meeting, that as I thought about putting this together and working with Kent and Zinnia, and others, I don’t know of another community anywhere — and I’ve been to a lot of communities and been involved with other mayors — I don’t know any place that has the level of care for their neighbors, and the resources available for helping each other, than Berea. That makes me really proud.”
Fraley then exhorted attendees to please volunteer or donate to any cause of their choice. “If you really want to help, open up your billfold,” he said.
Fraley thanked Gilbert, calling him his “partner in crime” and said that while they have been friends for years, on a recent trip as delegates to Berea’s sister city, Hokuto City, Japan, “we’ve gotten even closer”.
The mayor then asked for citizen feedback on the evening, and suggested it would be the first of many such events to bring the city together and help those in need.
Gilbert told the audience an audio recording of the evening had been made and would be used to strategize a plan to tighten gaps between services and those who need them. A timeline for when actions would be taken was not immediately available.
Following the discussion, Combs spoke with The Edge. “I’ve never seen anything like this in the community. It’s great. My hope is that [our] differences don’t take away from the things we can do.”
Combs went on to say that the forum showed how well local communities can take care of their own, and said state and federal governments are less efficient.
“We’ve given up so much control to the federal and state government to do things on our behalf. It’s a callousness. We’re not doing our part. We pay taxes and the government does all these programs. I mean we’re really not helping our communities,” Combs, magistrate, said. “I would rather give my money to someone I know locally rather than to the federal government.”
Combs, a Republican, is running for reelection in 2026. Fraley also recently announced he will run for reelection next summer in Berea’s nonpartisan election for city officials..
Sandy Bolster, a Berean, told The Edge in a text, “I was impressed with how polite people were. It was an example of how people with differing views can interact and be civil, even while discussing topics that people care deeply about, an emotionally charged set of concerns.”
The event began at 6:30 pm and wrapped at 8:30pm. Most of the time was spent in discussion, with only 10 minutes left for attendees to visit with the various panelists. There was much laughter and interaction between officials and citizens following the event.

(Photo by Antonio Lucero​/U.S. Forest Service)In Colorado we have 24 million acres of public lands, including 4.2 million roadless acres encompassing some of the best elk habitat on the continent. However, since the days of Theodore Roosevelt people driven by myopic greed have endeavored to remove public lands from public hands. 
Earlier this year they tried to sell off over 3 million acres.
“The motivations haven’t changed. This is the last great cash cow for people who don’t produce anything,” explained Hal Herring, a Field & Stream contributing editor and host of Backcountry Hunters & Anglers’ Podcast & Blast. “They don’t produce anything, but they know if they can get ahold of this, they can make a fortune. They’re simply taking from the American people.”

And U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, a Utah Republican, is leading the charge. During the first half of 2025 he spearheaded a proposal to sell 3.3 million acres of public lands as part of the “big, beautiful bill.” Fortunately, Americans across the political spectrum united in opposition with hunters, anglers, service members and veterans playing instrumental roles in killing his plan.
But as things turned out, the threat to our public lands wasn’t over. Now, instead of selling public lands outright, industry-friendly politicians are trying to open up some of our best elk habitat and backcountry areas to indiscriminate logging, drilling and mining by rescinding the Roadless Area Conservation Rule.
“On June 23, 2025, USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins rescinded the 2001 Roadless Area Conservation Rule, lifting restrictions on roadbuilding and logging across nearly 59 million acres of National Forest lands,” explained Devin O’Dea, BHA’s Western policy and conservation manager.
The Roadless Rule is the single most important government policy that benefits hunting and fishing in America.
Our national forests are already crisscrossed by 370,000 miles of roads — enough to circle the Earth 15 times. Too many roads are associated with degraded streams and rivers, increased big game vulnerability, and fewer mature bucks and bulls, often resulting in shorter seasons and fewer available tags. Elk occur in greater densities in roadless areas with greater success for hunters.
The Roadless Rule, which has been in place for nearly 25 years, has protected 58 million acres of our wildest national forest lands from road building and logging for more than a generation. The rule was created after more than 600 public hearings and received over 1.6 million comments with more than 95% in favor of adopting it — more comments than any other rule in the nation’s history.
During the recent 21-day Roadless Rule public comment period, 600,000 Americans spoke: 99% in favor of retaining the rule. Given the nearly universal popularity, bills have been introduced in Congress to permanently protect Roadless Areas. In the Senate, the Roadless Area Conservation Act already has 24 co-sponsors. The House version has 69 co-sponsors.
In addition, the Colorado Outdoor Recreation and Economy (CORE) Act, sponsored by Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado, would protect 100,000 roadless acres in Colorado as wilderness. Elk, bighorn sheep, black bears, mule deer, greenback cutthroat trout and more native species need roadless and wilderness areas to survive and thrive, and it’s our responsibility to do our part. However, the billionaire buzzards don’t agree.
“I think Teddy Roosevelt must be tired from rolling over in his grave,” U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich said recently, about the Trump administration’s efforts to open protected public lands to resource extraction.
“When Elon Musk steps on to a piece of public land, he and I are equals. And that’s what they can’t stand,” said Greg Bafundo, former lead wilderness ranger for the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest. “They have everything, except public lands.”
“I’m a capitalist, but I also understand that without sideboards of representative government, that is, ‘by the people,’ then capitalism will take everything,” Herring said. “Whoever the biggest fish is will eat everything.”
As Heinrich, Bafundo and Herring know well, public lands are not a left or right issue; they’re an American issue. This is our national heritage — once it’s gone, it is gone forever.
And as Theodore Roosevelt said, our duty, our responsibility to past, present and future generations is to “do what you can, with what you have, where you are.” Just as we defeated Lee’s sell-off provision, we must come together again and stand up for the places that hunters, anglers, veterans, service members and all Americans cherish.
Our public lands are too important to turn over to billionaire buzzards.

(Photo by Sam Gauntt/Capital News Service)David sat at a table in Hyattsville Immigration Court waiting for his asylum hearing to begin, with his advocates, two law students from the Immigration Clinic at the University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law, next to him.
His wife and three children huddled nearby on the churchlike wooden benches, dressed in their best, a few days before Thanksgiving. The long windowless corridors of the courthouse were far from welcoming, but they were all required to be there for their asylum hearing. David — Maryland Matters has agreed not to use the family’s name because of fear they may be targeted — was speaking for the family at the hearing.
It’s been a long road to get this far. The family fled government violence in their native Nicaragua in 2019 and sought asylum in neighboring Costa Rica. From there, they fled to the U.S. after reports of Nicaraguan forces crossing the border to target refugees.
They crossed the border in Hidalgo, Texas, seeking asylum in 2021. They moved to Maryland where, four years later, David was having his day in court.
But just days before the hearing, the Board of Immigration Appeals issued a new ruling that requires all immigration judges to rule first whether an asylum seeker could be safely deported to a third country. The Department of Homeland Security claimed that the asylum case should not be heard because the family could safely be relocated to a third country.

“This decision could suddenly take away our client’s right to due process while the [asylum] case was still pending,” said Cori Alonso-Yoder, the director of the Immigration Law Clinic and supervising attorney in David’s case. “This is particularly concerning given that our client’s activities included protected political speech that led to his persecution.”
Call me David
David’s journey began when he was very young, not long after the Sandinistas toppled the Somoza regime in 1979.
“After seizing power, the [Sandinista] party leader Daniel Ortega, created what can only be called an oppressive dictatorial regime, a campaign against political dissent, killing and torturing all those who opposed him,” David says now.
He said his mother, a housekeeper for a high-ranking official in the Somoza government, was held hostage, starved and tortured when her employer’s house was raided by Ortega sympathizers. David’s father was killed fighting alongside the U.S.-backed Contra rebels in Nicaragua’s civil war that stretched through the 1980s, leaving his mother to raise eight children.
Growing up he says his family was “monitored for its politics, a politics that favored the rule of law, freedom of expression, freedom of thought, political freedom and freedom of religion,” he said.
As a teenager he worked on the margins of the electoral system. As he got older, he joined political parties that nurtured his hunger for democracy and fight against corruption. He served as an election observer and as president of a polling station board. Eventually, he took his politics to the streets and participated in anti-government protests in his hometown and in other parts of the county.
But in April 2018, the situation drastically worsened, as protesters – at first, largely senior citizens and university students – rallied against a policy that would raise taxes and reduce pensions. Ortega forces retaliated by firing into the crowds, leaving many injured and dead.
David joined to stage successive massive rallies in many cities across Nicaragua that met with increasingly repressive assaults.

He says pictures of him were posted on social media. As a popular barber in his home town, paramilitary thugs knew where to find him, and where his wife worked, making them easy targets to capture. At one point they were run off the road by a police truck, in what David believes was an attempt to kill them.
“It was no longer safe in Nicaragua. I knew it wasn’t safe for me or my family,” he said.
Seeking sanctuary in Costa Rica
They fled to Costa Rica in early 2019 and requested asylum. They were among the 300,000 Nicaraguans who had entered that country since 2018 according to a 2025 UN Refugee Agency Report. They could be waiting years for that application to be processed, and lived in constant fear, David says.
“It is common that members from the Nicaraguan government would cross over the border to threaten, harm or even kill Nicaraguans in Costa Rica that opposed Ortega’s regime. We had to flee,” he said.
Once again, the family was on the move. From Costa Rica, they flew to Mexico, and later crossed the border at Hidalgo, Texas in 2021. There again they made a plea for asylum, and traveled to Maryland, settling in Montgomery County.
The next year the case reached the Immigration Clinic at the University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law, which monitors dozens of cases, and where law students, as a requirement for graduation, work on cases and represent clients under the guidance of Alonso-Yoder.
In the days after David’s hearing, asylum cases have become fraught after the shooting of two National Guard soldiers in Washington, D.C., allegedly by an Afghan refugee, which had led to a general crackdown on immigration cases. But the third-country ruling by the Board of Immigration Appeals has directly affected Daniel’s case.
Safe third country
That safe third country would be Honduras or Guatemala, both of which recently signed Asylum Cooperative Agreements with the United States. Alonso-Yoder said that since the hearing, Ecuador has been added to the list of third countries. David’s two law student lawyers and Alonso-Yoder rushed to prepare a response they could argue in court.

Alonso-Yoder says with reports of extrajudicial killings, their legal team was fairly confident that the family would face same the same issues that led them to leave their home country.
“The fact that operators from the Nicaraguan government can move and operate within Central America with impunity, without any kind of a consequence or prosecution for those crimes, is part of the concern,” she said.
David wants none of it.
“Honduras is not safe. Guatemala isn’t either. If these countries were safe for me, why are so many [there] fleeing to the United States?” he asked.
Once in court, Immigration Judge Alison Igoe almost immediately moved to postpone the hearing to give all parties time to review the facts and law surrounding the new ruling.  When they appear before her again this month, should she rule in their favor, their advocates can then proceed to argue the merits of their case for asylum.
Asylum claim
The two student attorneys said their claim is based on the fact that David was persecuted for his political opinion in Nicaragua, buttressed by first-person accounts from the family, statements from others who were persecuted and reports from nongovernmental organizations and the State Department. All the statements agree that David would be harmed or killed if returned to Nicaragua.
They paint a picture of a family man, who one described as “the pinnacle of what I think we should be showcasing when people talk about immigrants.”
Both believe David’s would have been an open-and-shut case a few years ago, but say that immigration cases have become more of a challenge given the “ever-growing changes in immigration law.”
But both believe they will get a fair hearing from Igoe when the return to her court this month. Data from TRAC, a nonpartisan research center that follows court decisions, showed that of the 405 asylum cases Igoe decided from fiscal 2020 through the first 11 months of fiscal 2024, she granted 53.6% and granted other relief to 3.2%. She denied 43.2%. That’s one of the highest approval rates of the 22 judges in the Hyattsville court.
David, an evangelical Christian, is a man of deep faith.
“I am a pilgrim on this earth, a Nicaraguan seeking safety in the world. I need security. I need to live in peace. I need to live without fear,” he said.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)A federal judge has ruled the Trump administration cannot withhold Federal Emergency Management Agency grants to help states prepare for natural disasters, including $21 million in Kentucky that was to pay for flood control, warning sirens and other safety measures.
Gov. Andy Beshear was among Democratic officials in 22 states and the District of Columbia who sued to protect FEMA’s Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program which started during the first Trump administration.
“In Kentucky, we’ve faced more than our share of natural disasters and this FEMA funding is essential to our rebuilding efforts across the state, including our high-ground communities in Eastern Kentucky,” Beshear said in a news release. “Ending this program is more than just short-sighted, it’s just plain wrong. I am glad the judge agreed and ruled that Kentucky’s $21 million was unlawfully withheld.”
FEMA announced in April that it was pulling the plug on what it called a “wasteful, politicized grant program” and “canceling all BRIC applications from Fiscal Years 2020-2023.” 
In their suit, the states said FEMA had selected nearly 2,000 projects “from every corner of the country to receive roughly $4.5 billion” and that “the BRIC program is critically important nationwide.”
U.S. District Judge Richard G. Stearns of Massachusetts, who was appointed by President Bill Clinton, ruled last week in favor of the states, writing that the administration’s shuttering of the program is an “unlawful Executive encroachment on the prerogative of Congress to appropriate funds for a specific and compelling purpose.”
Kentucky was expecting to receive funding through the program for 13 projects, according to  the governor’s news release, including flood control measures, emergency generators, warning sirens and more for Eastern Kentucky; as well as  $10.5 million to identify the most effective flood protection for Frankfort after its second highest flooding in history in April. FEMA had awarded and then pulled $21 million for Kentucky, including $3 million for management costs.
Kentucky has been hard hit by flooding in recent years, including one in southeastern Kentucky in 2022 that killed 45 people and damaged or destroyed thousands of homes. Beshear responded with what he calls a  “higher ground” initiative to replace homes lost to flooding by developing above the flood plains often on sites reclaimed from surface coal mining.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_0856-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-15 05:56:23.721685

(Courtesy of Friends of the Shenandoah Rail Trail)The Virginia Department of Transportation stunned Virginia’s transportation community by proposing a plan last Tuesday to potentially develop a multi-use trail and restore a deteriorated rail corridor in the Shenandoah Valley, with a possible price tag of nearly $700 million.
Plans for a recreational trail on the 50-mile Shenandoah rail corridor, backed by the Shenandoah Rail Trail Exploratory Partnership — a coalition of counties, towns, planning bodies and nonprofits — aim to boost the region’s economy and promote healthy lifestyles after 36 years of rail inactivity. The Shenandoah Rail Corridor Coalition also proposed restoring the Manassas Gap rail line and building a parallel trail. 
Projections indicate that converting the corridor into a recreational trail would cost $164 million compared to the $687 million to restore the rail line and add an adjacent trail, according to the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT). 
Secretary of Transportation Shep Miller at Tuesday’s Commonwealth Transportation Board work session, faced questions about the various costs of the project, stated, “I don’t know what to say about all that….”
“The legislature has given us $35 million and said ‘go forth and conquer’ and ‘don’t eliminate our trail with rail from your thought process,’” Miller said.
In 2023, Virginia lawmakers set aside up to $35 million for the Shenandoah Valley Rail Trail. The money was appropriated to buy land and to plan and start building a trail. VDOT was also tasked with thinking about ways to keep trains running in the area. Last Tuesday, the agency proposed advancing the trail concept alongside preservation of the railroad corridor for potential future rail service. 
The plan will transfer the project to the Virginia Passenger Rail Authority, the state agency that manages and expands passenger rail in the commonwealth. The Authority, partnering with the Shenandoah Valley Battlefields Foundation, will execute development. VDOT said that the proposal aligns with the 2021 feasibility study, which identified state agency involvement or a regionally sponsored nonprofit as potential methods for owning and maintaining the rail corridor.
Miller remains skeptical about rail’s economic feasibility. He said that state funds support only trail development, and stressed that future rail options will require additional fundraising. For now, he said, the proposal covers the trail while preserving the possibility of rail if it becomes viable.
Some Commonwealth Transportation Board members, including at-large member Becky Norton Dunlop, expressed general support for preserving both trail and rail options as well as the partnership between the Virginia Passenger Rail Authority and the Shenandoah Valley Battlefields Foundation, which has been supportive of a rail with trail.
“I think this is a fabulous idea,” Dunlop said last week. “I love the idea of the rail, the options. Most Civil War organizations have deep pockets. They have lots of access to lots of donors, and I love the idea of the trail.”
Other members questioned costs, foundation selection, and risk management, urging more oversight.
“Secretary, I’ve been in this type of government long enough to know that if it sounds too good to be true, it is too good to be true, and we’d better read that contract,” said Laura Sellers, a board member representing the Fredericksburg District. “I’m not really following what you’re doing here.”
The board did not take a vote during the work session.
 Battlefields Foundation proud to be considered

Keven Walker, executive director for the Shenandoah Valley Battlefields Foundation, did not go into specific details, but did tell the Mercury after the work session the organization has been in touch with the governor’s administration about the project, including after the foundation’s agreement with the rail corridor owner Norfolk Southern Corporation ended after more than a year.
When asked about the foundation’s ability to work on the project, Walker highlighted the group’s long-term involvement and track record in managing similar projects and overseeing millions in state funds. In 1996, Congress created the foundation to preserve the region’s Civil War battlefields and related historic sites around Winchester, Harrisonburg, and Staunton.  
Walker said the foundation also included the rail corridor in its 2000 management plan.
“We were set up, now for more than two decades, to be a potential lead managing partner for any massive project regarding this corridor,” Walker said. “I think that’s one reason why we’re being looked at as a potential leader on this issue.”
On the subject of costs, Walker said experts who have worked with the foundation have determined the costs to be much lower than VDOT has estimated. The Shenandoah Rail Corridor Coalition, which represents a group of businesses and organizations including the Foundation, estimates the rail with trails project to cost $142 million.
The foundation was embroiled in a court fight over the issue, after one of its members argued that the organization has “no legal authority” to restore commercial freight service on the rail corridor and that the foundation’s involvement strays far from its mission and threatens its federal tax-exempt status. 
In the spring, Walker said the foundation will return to court to prove that it did not act beyond its authority through its involvement with the rail trail project. 
“This is a preservation project for us, first and foremost,” Walker said. “This is an economic development project for us, for heritage tourism and the ag industry, and it touches every aspect of who we are as an organization. We are well fitted to take advantage of this tremendous opportunity that we’re honored to have, and we would not be living up to the directives and responsibilities given to us by Congress if we didn’t continue with this project.”
 Reaction to proposal

Del. Tony Wilt, R-Harrisonburg, who represents a portion of the area where the corridor sits, responded soon after the proposal became public, arguing that the latest study points to the trail-only option as “a feasible path forward and the one with the broadest community support.”
Wilt, who carried the budget request to study the feasibility and benefits of a rail trail in 2021, also questioned how likely the proposed rail-with-trail project would be, since no credible rail operator has ever been identified or come forward with a serious proposal.

Additionally, he pointed out that references to public hearings and opportunities for community input on the third and final assessment report have been removed from VDOT’s website.
“Instead, the secretary’s office presented a new proposal that has not been publicly vetted, is inconsistent with the findings of the latest VDOT study, allows no opportunity for competing proposals, and asks CTB to act within roughly a month without sufficient transparency or public engagement,” Wilt said in a statement. 
Wilt said pursuing the rail-with-trail option could derail the whole plan.
“Most concerning is that the proposal seems to require that the existing rail infrastructure remain in place, effectively forcing a rail-with-trail scenario that, as previously outlined based on the study, poses steep hurdles to success. This provision alone may function as a poison pill and could prevent any trail infrastructure from ever being developed.”
The new proposal also prompted the Shenandoah Rail Trail Exploratory Partnership and its members to question the process, costs, and threats to the rail-to-trail project in a letter to the Commonwealth Transportation Board and the Virginia Passenger Rail Authority. The partnership also claimed the proposal was rushed.
“We don’t want them to just rush and be done with it,” said Kate Wofford, executive director of the Alliance for Shenandoah Valley. “We want them to make a good decision for our communities and the taxpayer dollars in the future.”
Don Hindman, project director for the Shenandoah Rail Trail Exploratory Partnership, said he was optimistic the cost outlined in the third report would encourage the state to move forward with the rail-to-trail option, arguing that it would provide “the most economic and health benefits to the highest number of Virginians for the least capital investment in the shortest time.”
It is unclear if the board members received copies of the third assessment report on Tuesday, which was not included in the agenda. One member requested a copy of the report and was told it had been released publicly in November and that a copy could be provided.
 What’s next?

VPRA’s Board of Directors is scheduled to hold a meeting on Tuesday to authorize Executive Director DJ Stadtler to revise the authority’s budget to accept the funds from the CTB and provide funding for the proposed plan. If successful, the CTB will meet in January to transfer the funds to the VPRA.
Wilt asked the VPRA board to delay any action.
“The best path forward in the immediate (future) is for VDOT to complete the public hearings promised as part of the study,” he said. “After the conclusion of that process, if the consensus is for an entity other than the commonwealth to take over the project and manage or own the corridor, then a competitive RFP style process should be undertaken so all qualified organizations may submit proposals. CTB could then select the option that is most viable and most likely to succeed.”

Republicans are crying foul.
But 12 years ago, Republicans in the Virginia Senate broke tradition by trying to force through a mid-decade redistricting of their own in an effort to win an outright majority in the chamber, which at the time was locked in a 20-20 partisan tie.
Back then, Democrats were the ones howling with indignation.
The Senate Republicans’ 2013 redistricting bid caused such an uproar that major legislative issues that year grounded to a halt for two weeks. A semblance of order was restored only after House Speaker Bill Howell — resisting tremendous pressure from fellow Republicans — ruled the Senate action out of order.

The 2013 incident is a reminder of the length politicians of either party can go when given the opportunity to perpetuate their political power.
“A pox on Republicans for starting it,” said former Republican Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling in a recent interview, “and a pox on the Democrats for now wanting to be part of it.”
The redrawing of Virginia’s legislative districts has happened only once every decade, soon after Census population totals are updated. The only exceptions have been when courts ordered the General Assembly to correct violations of the federal Voting Rights Act.
But in 2013, Senate Republicans didn’t want to wait the better part of a decade (and two election cycles) to reverse maps that Democrats had forced on them two years earlier.
The Senate GOP came up with a mid-decade surprise. They drew more favorable maps that, if adopted, would have put the GOP in a much stronger position in the next general election, which was scheduled for November 2015.
They waited for the House of Delegates to send over a routine bill that contained small, technical adjustments to existing House districts. The plan was to amend the bill to include wholesale changes to all 40 districts.
With Bolling’s tie-breaking vote, Republicans could push the GOP-friendly measure through the Senate. Then, all they would need was the House of Delegates (controlled by a GOP super-majority) to go along and for Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell to sign it into law.

Jeff Ryer, the political staffer for the caucus, said he worried for months that the word would get out. “It had to be one of the best-kept secrets I’ve ever seen in the General Assembly,” he said.
But the plan hit a snag.
Bolling, who in December 2012 bowed out of a bitter gubernatorial nomination contest with conservative Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, told GOP senators that they could not count on his tie-breaking vote.
“It was not something I was comfortable with,” Bolling recently said of the mid-decade changes. “ I was exploring the possibility of an independent campaign for governor. I kind of carved out a different path. I think a lot of guys (in the caucus) understood it.” 
Senate Republicans had to put their surprise plan on hold for a day when at least one Democrat was absent. 
The opportunity came on Monday, Jan. 21, when the late Sen. Henry Marsh, D-Richmond skipped the daily floor session to attend President Barack Obama’s second-term inauguration in Washington.
Marsh’s empty seat on the Senate floor gave the Republicans a temporary majority of 20-19.
To present the plan, the caucus turned to a moderate with a good-guy image. Sen. John Watkins, R-Midlothian, was the most unlikely legislator to pull what the Charlottesville Daily Progress editorial page would call “one of the most politically cynical and morally flawed maneuvers” in years.
“It wasn’t something I dreamed up,” Watkins said in an interview earlier this month. “The leadership told me, ‘You’re probably the only person who can stand up on the floor and get this through.’”’
Stunned, Democrats exploded with fury. They called the move unconstitutional. They vowed to sue. They threatened to throw sand in the legislative gears. “The collateral damage from this will be immeasurable,” thundered Democratic Senate Minority Leader Richard Saslaw, D-Fairfax.
Undaunted, Republicans rammed through the new maps on a party-line.
The bill moved back to the House, where its fate rested with Howell. The Speaker was charged with determining if House rules would allow the amendment to proceed.
In a recent interview, Howell said that almost from the start he believed the Senate amendment was not “germane” because it went far beyond the narrow scope of the House bill. But he faced pushback from within his own caucus. 
House Republicans excluded Howell from some closed-door caucus meetings, an extraordinary challenge to his power. “There was a group within the caucus who said, ‘Why in the world would you not do it’?” said Howell, who served as Speaker from 2003 until 2018.
“There was one guy who said, Why don’t we rush the podium and take him out?’” Howell deadpanned. “Luckily that didn’t happen.”
As pressure built on Howell and the legislative uncertainty entered a second week, Senate Republicans sought to justify their mid-decade surprise. 
In a Richmond Times-Dispatch op-ed, Sen. Ryan T. McDougle said the GOP’s action was justified in undoing Democratic maps that he said broke up communities of interest, manipulated population deviations and ignored opportunities to create a sixth minority-majority district.
“Those opposed to (the new maps) may call it a gerrymander, but they’re wrong, both historically and technically – the current districting scheme is a gerrymander,” McDougle wrote.
Some Senate Republicans were more candid about the political motivations of their plan. 
Then-Senate Republican Leader Tommy Norment chided Senate Democrats, who had similar partisan incentives when they held power in 2011, of wrapping themselves “in a shroud of political virtue.”

In a recent interview, Norment said his biggest objection to the 2011 maps was that they broke up Yorktown, Jamestown and Williamsburg, known as the Historic Triangle. 
“My interest was more geographic than partisan,” he said.
In the GOP redo,  Williamsburg was removed from the district of Sen. John Miller, a Newport News Democrat, and restored to Norment’s domain.
But the tinkering with Miller’s district didn’t end there. Republicans stripped 16 precincts from Miller’s home base of Newport News and pushed a portion of his district across the James River, where it cut a narrow, 40-mile path from Smithfield to the outskirts of Petersburg, breaking up communities of interest along the way.
If the Senate plan had become law, Miller’s district would have gone from +15-D to +5-R – a rightward swing of 20 points.
As the standoff dragged on into February, Watkins came to regret his decision to go along with the January surprise. His nice-guy image was compromised and Democrats’ support of his two big initiatives —  transportation funding and uranium mining — evaporated.
“With a single, premeditated act of political survival, the 31-year lawmaker and chairman of the Senate committee that oversees big business managed to get on nearly everyone’s #%!@ list,” observed Jeff Schapiro in the second of two columns in the Richmond Times-Dispatch that excoriated Watkins.
Meanwhile, then-Sen. Donald McEachin, D-Henrico, took the floor to lay bare the pretense of Senate Republicans’ claim that their maps had been motivated by “being good to Black folks.” He noted that the plan would pack Black people into districts, diluting their power in the suburbs. 
“That is plantation politics,” McEachin said.
On February 6, the crisis ended when Howell issued his ruling that the Senate amendment strayed too far from the narrow, technical intent of the House bill. 
Looking back, Howell said that most people who pressed him to rule otherwise understood his belief that the legislature’s institutional integrity depends on consistent application of the rules.
“They did not try to make the case it was germane,” Howell recalled. “They were just saying, ‘Bill, this would really help if you saw it this way.’”
Those who know Howell well say he was placed under an incredible amount of pressure to look the other way.  
“Bill Howell paid dearly for that decision,” recalled Del. Bobby Orrock, R-Spotsylvania, one his lieutenants.
When asked if the ruling was the most significant decision in his 15 years as speaker, Howell said, “It was up there pretty high.”
Howell added that he wasn’t looking to open old wounds or make himself appear holier than thou. “It was an easy thing to do what I did because it was right,” he said.
Looking back, Watkins regrets his decision to go along with the plan. He agrees that Howell made the right call.
“You go through life and sometimes you screw up. This was one of them,” said Watkins, who announced in 2015 that he would not seek re-election, ending a legislative career that began in 1982.

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury) Last spring Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed more energy bills than he signed, killing legislation designed to increase rooftop solar and energy storage, strengthen utility planning requirements, and make efficiency improvements more available to low-income residents. 
Now, with Abigail Spanberger set to replace Youngkin in the Governor’s Mansion and Democrats in a position of legislative strength, those bills are back.
Democrats revive clean-energy bills as Spanberger prepares to take office

Members of the Commission on Electric Utility Regulation (CEUR) met several times this fall to examine last year’s failed energy bills to determine which should get the commission’s endorsement this year. CEUR is comprised primarily of legislative leaders from the Senate and House committees that hear energy bills, so endorsements signal a strong likelihood of passage. 
But while the bills CEUR endorsed show promise, I can’t help thinking they had better be just a starting point.  
Energy affordability and making data centers pay their fair share are supposed to be the top objectives for legislators this year. That makes it interesting, and concerning, that even as CEUR went beyond the vetoed bills to endorse some small new initiatives, it didn’t propose any legislation that would either supercharge generation in Virginia or put the onus on the tech companies to solve their supply problem themselves.  
We know bills like that are coming. Ann Bennett, the lead author of the Sierra Club’s comprehensive report on the state of the industry in Virginia, was, I hope, being hyperbolic when she told me she expects “a hundred” data center bills this session. Regardless, there will be a lot of them. 
Many will be land use bills that don’t go to the energy committees, but others will tackle the central contradiction at the heart of Virginia’s data center buildout: our leaders want the industry to grow, but haven’t faced squarely the problem of where the energy will come from. 
 Getting more power on the grid (or freeing up capacity)

Some of the vetoed bills returning this year will put more energy on the grid. They won’t be enough to power the data center industry, but every bit helps. This includes one of the environmental communities’ top priorities, a bill that expands the role of rooftop solar in Virginia’s renewable portfolio standard (RPS). 
A new bill permitting balcony solar also got CEUR’s endorsement. Balcony solar – two or three panels that plug into a wall outlet, reducing a resident’s need to buy power – is the buzziest new idea of the year. The systems are too small to make much of a difference in megawatt terms, but by democratizing access to solar they counter the reputation of solar as a technology for rich people and will make it possible for solar skeptics to see for themselves that solar does actually work and save money.
Another CEUR initiative is a bill similar to one Youngkin vetoed that creates a carveout in the state’s renewable portfolio standard specifically for geothermal heat pumps. Like balcony solar, geothermal heat pumps don’t put electricity onto the grid, but by freeing up power for other customers it has the same effect.
 CEUR also endorsed a bill to simplify billing in the shared solar program in Appalachian Power Company’s territory, but a far more significant proposal to greatly expand shared solar in Dominion territory was deemed not ready for consideration after one of its patrons, Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax, said it was still in negotiation.  
The SCC recently directed a change in the calculation of Dominion Energy’s minimum bill that industry advocates say should make the program workable for customers beyond the low-income residents who were the only ones formerly able to access it. As currently drafted, the bill would allow shared solar to increase up to a maximum of 6% of Dominion’s peak load. That gives this bill the potential to make a meaningful dent in Virginia’s energy shortfall – if Dominion doesn’t block it. 
That assumes developers can get the community solar projects permitted at the local level. 
Virginia localities are notorious for denying permits to solar projects of all sizes, a recalcitrance that has contributed to Virginia having to import fully half of the electricity consumed in the state. CEUR has now scrapped last year’s big idea of allowing solar developers to appeal local government permit denials to the SCC, after failing to persuade enough legislators to vote for it last year. All that is left of that bill is a piece that establishes a university consortium to provide research and technical assistance. 
Luckily, last year’s other major solar siting bill lives on; it codifies best practices for solar projects without removing localities’ ability to deny permits even for projects that meet the high standards. New this year, however, is a requirement that localities provide a record of their decisions to the SCC, including the reason for any adverse decision. 
It’s not the solution the industry and landowners need to bring predictability to the local permitting process, but it does ratchet up pressure on county boards that have a habit of denying projects without articulating a legitimate reason. And sure enough, imposing that modest amount of accountability was enough to get Joe Lerch from the Virginia Association of Counties to speak against the proposal at the CEUR meeting. 
VACO seems likely to lose the fight this time around, and it should. Blocking solar development leads directly to higher electricity prices for consumers across the state. Moreover, it denies even a minimum of due process to landowners who want to install solar on their property – including farmers who need the income just to hold onto their land. For VACO to insist on counties having carte blanche to reject projects, with no responsibility to justify their decision, is arrogant and an abuse of the local prerogative.
 Making the most of what’s already there

Anyone who keeps up with energy news has learned more in the past year about how the grid works than most of us ever wanted to know. There is widespread agreement that grid operator PJM has mismanaged its job, keeping new low-cost generation from interconnecting and driving up utility bills for customers across the region. Unfortunately, there is little that Virginia can do by itself to fix PJM.
But one key bit of information we can use is that utilities and the grid operator build infrastructure to meet the highest levels of demand on the hottest afternoons and coldest nights of the year, leaving much of that infrastructure sitting idle at other times. A recent study showed the grid could absorb far more data center demand than it can now if it weren’t for the 5% of the time when demand is at its highest. 
The issue is framed in terms of data centers being willing to curtail operations at times of peak demand, a solution for the companies that can do it. But there is also a broader point: we don’t need as much new generation if we use what we have better. 
That’s the principle behind several bills that CEUR endorsed. The most significant of these is a bill vetoed by Youngkin last year that almost doubles the targets for short-term energy storage laid out in the Virginia Clean Economy Act and adds targets for long-duration energy storage. As currently drafted, the 2026 version also adds new fire safety standards.
But CEUR did not discuss another obvious approach to increasing storage capacity on the grid: requiring data centers to have storage on-site, replacing highly-polluting diesel generators for at least the first couple of hours of a power outage and using spare battery capacity to assist the grid at other times. If Virginia is going to keep adding data centers at the current rate, this simply has to be part of the plan. We need far more storage than the CEUR bill calls for, and tech companies, not ratepayers, should bear the cost.
CEUR’s utility reform proposals would also help Virginia’s grid get the most out of what we already have. A bill to improve the integrated resource planning process (again, vetoed by Youngkin) requires utilities to consider surplus interconnection service projects to maximize existing transmission capacity. 
 Helping low-income residents save money 

CEUR endorsed several proposals that could help residents save money on energy bills. Some, like shared solar, balcony solar, geothermal heat pumps and the distributed solar expansion bill, would benefit anyone willing to make the investment.

For low-income residents, weatherization and efficiency upgrades remain the focus. Last year the governor vetoed legislation from Del. Mark Sickles, D-Fairfax and Sen. Lamont Bagby, D-Henrico, which would have required Dominion and APCo to expand their low-income weatherization assistance to reach 30% of qualifying customers.  Sickles has already reintroduced his bill as HB2. CEUR endorsed a different recommendation from staff that the two utilities be required to extend their spending on energy assistance and weatherization programs. 
CEUR did not examine a related bill that has been reintroduced this year following a Youngkin veto last winter, establishing an income-qualified energy efficiency and weatherization task force to produce policy recommendations to ensure repairs and retrofits reach all eligible households. 
However, CEUR endorsed a bill that will require all utilities to disclose to the SCC information about electric utility disconnections, which presumably will inform the work of the task force.  
 We’re going to need more

Even taken together, CEUR’s initiatives don’t fully address the biggest energy crunch Virginia has ever faced, and the rising utility bills that result. Possibly that is intentional; Democrats will continue to control the governor’s seat as well as the legislature for at least two years, giving them time to ramp up programs and see what works.
But data center development is so far outstripping supply side solutions that if legislators aren’t more aggressive this year, next year they will find themselves further behind than ever.  
As more bills are filed over the coming weeks, we are likely to see plenty of bold proposals. Hopefully, legislators now understand the urgency, and will be ready to act.

(Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)Discrimination doesn’t have to be intentional to cause harm.
That’s the principle the federal government has long used to investigate and remedy disparities based on race, color or national origin in education and other programs receiving federal funds. But no longer, according to a new rule Attorney General Pam Bondi posted last week.
The regulation does not “sufficiently serve the public interest” and violates President Trump’s executive order about promoting meritocracy, she wrote. The law, she said, “promises that people are treated as individuals, not components of a particular race or group.”
The provision stems from Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination in education, housing, health care and transportation. Historically, federal agencies used the law to warn districts that they could lose federal funds if they didn’t comply with orders to desegregate schools. Under the Department of Justice rule, officials could use data to determine whether discrimination exists.
In a 2014 case, for example, an investigation in New Hampshire showed that under the Manchester district’s policy for assigning students to Advanced Placement and honors courses, Black students were enrolled in those classes at far lower rates.
While Title VI applies to multiple programs and activities, from access to advanced classes to enrollment procedures, school discipline has been at the forefront of the debate over using data to prove discrimination exists. Federal data consistently shows that Black students are disciplined at higher rates than their peers, disparities that districts have been under pressure to address.
Bondi’s move to rescind the 50-year-old rule means that the government will no longer hold schools responsible for any neutral policies or behavior that, according to data, negatively affect students of a certain race or nationality. The action, without offering any opportunity for public comment, aligns with the Trump administration’s push to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives from the nation’s schools. Fear of a federal investigation, conservatives argue, can interfere with districts’ ability to manage their schools.
Others argue rescinding the rule decreases the chances all students will receive an equal education.

To Ease Civil Rights Backlog, McMahon Orders Back Staff She Tried to Fire

 




“This has real-world implications,” said GeDá Jones Herbert, chief legal counsel at Brown’s Promise, a nonprofit that supports efforts to create more integrated schools. Discrimination, she said, isn’t always obvious. “Sometimes we can’t find the fire, and the smoke is enough.”
A group of former Department of Justice attorneys, who left the administration in part because of its education policies, criticized the move.
“We ensured children could attend accessible and integrated schools while protecting them from abuse at the hands of police or the juvenile justice system,” they wrote in a letter. “We left because this administration turned the division’s core mission upside down, largely abandoning its duty to protect civil rights.”
The shift in policy comes as the Education Department calls back over 250 civil rights staff, who have been on administrative leave, to handle a mounting backlog of cases. A January OCR report, issued before Trump took office, showed that the volume of complaints continues to increase year over year.
‘Ideological weapon’
This week’s announcement applies only to the Justice Department, but other agencies, including education, plan to follow Bondi’s lead. Signaling its intentions, the Education Department has already withdrawn an agreement, reached during the Biden administration, requiring the Rapid City schools in South Dakota to address discipline disparities.
An Office for Civil Rights investigation found that Native American students in the district were twice as likely as white students to face discipline referrals during the 2021-22 school year and almost five times more likely to be suspended. The district was expected to hire staff to focus on equity in discipline, revise its policies and create a committee that included a member of the Native American community.
Rick Hess, the director of education policy studies at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, called the administration’s new policy a “necessary corrective.”
“The Obama and Biden administrations turned disparate impact into an ideological weapon,” he said.
In 2014, the Obama administration issued guidance that said schools in which Black and Hispanic students were disproportionately suspended or expelled could be in violation of Title VI — even when those students misbehaved at higher rates. The document warned that even if a policy was “administered in an evenhanded manner,” it could have a “disparate impact.”
Michael Petrilli, president of the conservative Thomas B. Fordham Institute, argued that the guidance, and less-punitive “restorative” approaches to addressing misbehavior, kept districts from removing disruptive and violent students and robbed other minority students of the chance to learn.

The Education Community Braced for Guidance on Student Discipline. It Never Came

 




During the first Trump administration, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos rescinded the document, calling it an example of federal overreach. Under Secretary Miguel Cardona, the department indicated that it would reissue guidance related to discipline disparities, but officials held off. Experts speculated that it would be a politically risky move and that the pandemic had exacerbated behavior issues.
But the absence of explicit guidance didn’t hinder the Biden administration from investigating districts for disproportionality. Last September, Kentucky’s Jefferson County district entered into an agreement with the Department of Justice to address racial disparities in discipline. An investigation showed that Black students were disciplined at higher rates and faced harsher consequences than white students for the same offenses.
Joshua Dunn, executive director of the Institute of American Civics at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, said that according to Bondi’s interpretation, the Obama-era discipline guidance did not comply with the law.
“Students who suffer the most from disparate impact disciplinary policies are minority students who have their education sabotaged by a few troublemakers who are kept in the classroom,” he said. Those are the students, he said, who will be “the most significant beneficiaries of this change.”
Bondi wrote that the administration tried to find a compromise by requiring schools, for example, to “remedy unintentional discrimination.”
“But any version of imposing liability for unintentional discrimination is inconsistent with Title VI’s original public meaning,” Bondi wrote. “Regardless, even a modified version of disparate-impact liability would not eliminate the department’s serious legal and policy concerns.”

She’d given birth to Lily two years earlier as a state prisoner, and the relative who’d cared for the child since was seeking full custody. Edwards had been out for a year and was proud of her progress. She was sober and had a job, a home and a car. But when she recognized the judge that fall day in 2020, Edwards said she felt her hopes vanish. The Walton County judge knew her from the drug-dealing case that sent Edwards to prison. 
Edwards said she told the judge that she made no excuses for her failures and knew she would have to prove herself. She asked the judge for a plan to eventually get Lily back. 
The judge gave the relative full custody and ordered Edwards to have no contact with her daughter. 
“So guess what I did,” Edwards said later in an interview. “I went and got high.”
And she kept getting high, she said, to dull the pain. She was arrested a year later on a shoplifting charge, then a probation violation. Out on bond, she found out she was pregnant again. She expected to give birth for a second time as a state prisoner and couldn’t face the trauma. Terrified, she asked for help from Amy Ard, the executive director of the nonprofit Motherhood Beyond Bars, which helps new mothers who are incarcerated in Georgia and their children’s caregivers.
Ard, whose nonprofit contracted with the state, went to prison facilities to lead childbirth education classes, postpartum support groups and prenatal yoga. She even threw baby showers in the prisons. Ard and the nonprofit also championed legislation that banned shackling incarcerated women before, during or after childbirth in Georgia. Ard had met Edwards years earlier during one of her prison postpartum classes.
Ard said she wasn’t surprised when Edwards relapsed after losing custody of Lily. Edwards’ story was deeply emblematic of why many women remain in cycles of incarceration after suffering trauma and drug addiction. 
Ard, a longtime doula, was horrified by the prospect of Edwards giving birth as a prisoner for a second time and maybe losing custody of another child.
But could a nonprofit stop a pregnant woman from going to prison? 
Getting lost, giving birth in custody
Edwards’ path to incarceration was tragically common. 
Edwards, a Columbus native, grew up around heavy drinking and domestic violence. She said she would later realize that it taught her that turning to a substance was the way to control emotions, and that violence was normal in relationships. She never really felt loved or understood, and as she became a teenager, she searched for love from men. At 18, a boyfriend introduced her to methamphetamine, and she got lost for a decade in drugs and abusive relationships. 
By 2016, Edwards was 29 with a 3-year-old son and descending into a relapse. She said she couldn’t stand the feeling of endangering him while she was in active addiction, making bad decisions that seemed good while high. She stayed high at all times because it was the only way she knew to survive the traumas that otherwise consumed her mind. 
And men kept hurting her. 
Fleeing one, Edwards ended up selling and using drugs out of a Monroe motel while pregnant. 
Edwards, six months pregnant, was sentenced to two years in prison, three on probation. 
On Aug. 6, 2018, Edwards was taken from a DeKalb County medical prison to Atlanta Medical Center, where she gave birth with complications. In the room to witness the moment was a guard from the Georgia Department of Corrections. The agency said in a statement that pregnant prisoners get wrap-around services and that staff who work with them have “trauma informed” training. The statement did not address Edwards’ specific concerns. Edwards said she was allowed a total of about six hours, over two days, with newborn Lily. The last time she saw her, Edwards thought she was supposed to have one more visit to say goodbye. And so Edwards gave the baby a kiss, said she loved her and that she would be back to feed her.

In her windowless hospital room, guards handed her a prison uniform and said to get ready to leave. “I started bawling, because in my mind, I just lied to my baby, and she’s not even three days old,” recalled Edwards, who wouldn’t see Lily for six months. 
Getting in the transport van, Edwards said a guard confiscated the photos of Lily that the hospital had given her.
Edwards was taken to Lee Arrendale State Prison in north Georgia, where she said staff made her squat and cough, though she had fresh stitches, to make sure she wasn’t smuggling contraband. She was sent to the infirmary, where, she said, she didn’t even get bed sheets. A fellow prisoner went and found her some, and from that moment, Edwards would notice that she so rarely received help from the prison system. Prison meant constant deprivation, feeling dehumanized and new trauma. But in the year and a half she spent in state custody, Edwards said the people who really helped her were almost always other women serving time.
On the run 
When Edwards was released in September 2019, she walked all over Monroe trying to find a job until she landed a cook position at Pizza Hut. Even after losing custody of Lily and relapsing, Edwards kept the job. She stayed close with Ard, who marveled at her progress.
But Edwards wasn’t doing as well as it appeared.
In September 2021, she was pulled over with her boyfriend. An officer told her she had an outstanding warrant for stealing $140 worth of products from a Walmart in Walton County. Edwards was still on probation from the motel drug dealing case. 
Edwards waited two months in jail before she was released with an ankle monitor. Motherhood Beyond Bars helped her get into a drug rehab program in nearby Gwinnett County. She had to go every day for check-ins and classes. 
Months into the program in 2022, Edwards learned that she was pregnant with her third child. The father, Taylor Layman, was her co-defendant from the drug dealing case. They hadn’t officially dated until long after they were released from prison, but they’d always had a connection and saw a future together. Finally, a man treated her well and took her as she was.
Their relationship, however, was not allowed under their probation. Co-defendants weren’t supposed to have any contact. Less than two months into her pregnancy, Edwards heard that officials were sending her back to prison for violating her probation by dating her co-defendant. Edwards called the probation office and was told to surrender right away.
Edwards said she would be there soon. But really, when she hung up the phone, Edwards said she kept thinking about the trauma of giving birth to Lily as a state prisoner and just couldn’t fathom surviving it again. 
Edwards called Ard and gave her a heads up: I’m on the run.
A chance to avoid the dangers?
Ard and staff were several years into redesigning Motherhood Beyond Bars’ work. In late 2019, Ard said she and, consequently, the nonprofit were deemed no longer allowed at state prisons after conflicts with Department of Corrections officials. The nonprofit kept learning about pregnant women in prison. In its statement, the prison system said it offers extensive services for pregnant prisoners before and after birth, and women have praised a doula program run in partnership with Emory University’s nursing school and the Georgia Prison Motherhood Project. 
When Motherhood Beyond Bars moved out of the prisons, the nonprofit expanded its support for caregivers and their families. It began offering a free “lifetime” supply of diapers for each child — an enormous savings. 
Between 50 and 100 women give birth in custody as state prisoners each year in Georgia. Ard said it’s key to reach them as soon as possible to help establish care and start services. Babies born to incarcerated women have been found to be more likely to be born premature or have a low birth weight or other troubles. And other mothers had called the prison birth experience traumatic, along with the devastatingly quick separation from the child and abrupt delivery to prison. 
Ard didn’t want Edwards to go through it again. She didn’t advise going on the run, though. 
Not that Edwards ran far. She was in Monroe.

Edwards was arrested in July 2022 at, of all places, the Walton County courthouse, attending a hearing for her boyfriend’s case. She had hoped no one would recognize her because of the face mask she wore against COVID-19. In hindsight, she would laugh at that plan — thinner than an N95. She was quickly recognized.
Edwards was six months pregnant, which she assumed was a factor in the decision to let her go with an ankle monitor hours later.
Edwards went online and contacted rehab centers, including Hope House, an inpatient facility for women in Augusta. Staff responded, and she was floored to be accepted for free admission. But she needed help getting probation and the court to agree to it.
Edwards called Ard, asking for her help to stay out of prison. Ard and the nonprofit had never tried such a thing. But she was inspired. Ard wrote a letter to the lawyer appointed to represent Edwards, praising Edwards and offering to help encourage the court to send Edwards to treatment. 
The lawyer welcomed the help, and with Ard’s intervention, her probation officer and the judge agreed that Edwards needed treatment. But if she failed and turned up in court again, the judge said, Edwards would go straight to prison.
Hope?
Edwards embraced life at Hope House, where women lived in their own apartment in big tan buildings and socialized in the yard. Edwards and other women helped each other take maternity photos by the pond, which was surrounded by flowering plants.
Edwards attended group meetings and counseling and gained insight into her past behaviors. She developed emotional tools and accepted the damage she caused. And she understood that trust and forgiveness would be earned, not given.
Edwards kept working on what she could control and getting ready for her daughter. On Oct. 31, 2022, Edwards gave birth to Billie at a local hospital with the father in the room. 
Edwards brought Billie back to Hope House, where they lived until Edwards completed the program in February 2023. She opted to continue treatment as an outpatient while living six months in transitional housing.
That August, Edwards graduated after a year of treatment. Edwards and Billie moved in with the father. They had decided to stay in Augusta, where they were building a strong community of friends and support for their sobriety. They soon welcomed a son, Wilder. 
A purpose
In December 2024, Edwards started a job she seemed made for. She’s a program coordinator at Motherhood Beyond Bars, where she offers support to caregivers looking after the children of incarcerated mothers. She helps with government assistance paperwork and sends free diapers.

Critically, Edwards works to maintain contact between the children and their mothers in prison. And she talks with the mothers, sometimes sharing her experience to offer encouragement or give perspective. She finds echoes of her story in theirs. She sees so many women who just need help getting up after falling down. 
Ard said Edwards’ helped transform the nonprofit, launching diversion efforts that have helped 21 pregnant women go to treatment instead of prison. The women were found through Motherhood Beyond Bars’ jail programs, which started in 2023 with inspiration from Edwards’ case as a new way for the nonprofit to identify pregnant women before they reach state prison. With more than 150 county jails in Georgia, Ard started by building partnerships with sheriffs whose facilities had often held pregnant women. She found most sheriffs eager to accept free help facilitating care. By December 2025, the nonprofit had agreements in 11 counties: Bibb, Carroll, Cobb, Douglas, Floyd, Fulton, Hall, Polk, Rockdale, Troup and Ware. The nonprofit has identified 111 pregnant women so far in jails. Ard said the group is supporting 392 incarcerated mothers’ children, and 1,056 members of caregivers’ families. 
Ard said expanding into new counties will require more funding, but she’s determined to keep changing things for expectant moms in trouble — with Edwards at her side. 
Edwards spent Thanksgiving visiting with her oldest son, along with Billie and Wilder. She still can’t see Lily but is thankful that she is safe. With Billie and Wilder, Edwards is grateful to be able to give them a peaceful home and the emotional tools she never learned growing up.

(Photo courtesy of Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management Office of Emergency Response)Linda Perri has seen — and smelled — a lot in the more than 40 years she has lived in Washington Park in Providence. Some days are worse than others.
“You can’t open your windows in the summer, you can’t sit outside in your yard, front or back,” Linda Perri, who is president of her neighborhood association, said in a Nov. 14 interview.
For decades, many South Providence residents have suffered from pollution caused by industrial businesses on Allens Avenue and the Port. Some recall being awoken by the pungent odor of asphalt and experiencing nausea, headaches, and fatigue. In 2022, a school was even evacuated due to smells from the Port being mistaken for a gas leak. And though hundreds of air quality complaints have been made, Rhode Island has continued to prioritize economic profit over the wellbeing of its people. The time has come for the state to put the health of its people first and hold these entities accountable.
Allens Avenue, home to asphalt plants, scrap metal dealers, oil and gas companies, and salt distributors, has been called “the most toxic and polluted stretch of roadway in Rhode Island” by the Providence Streets Coalition, a group of over 40 community organizations, local businesses, schools, associations, and individuals supporting safe and healthy streets.
The impact of this pollution on surrounding communities is severe. The combination of noxious emissions from I-95 and pollution from businesses along Allens Avenue and the Port may contribute to Rhode Island’s asthma rate for adults exceeding the national average. In 2021, 12.6% of the state’s adult population had the condition, far above the national average of 9.7%. Rates among Rhode Island youth have decreased in recent years but were at 6.6% compared to the national average of 6.5%.
“It’s a struggle. There’s so much pollution. There’s so much road debris.” Perri said. “There’s a lot of things that could be done in this neighborhood to create a healthier, more environmentally-friendly port area.”
State officials are not doing enough to prevent bad actors from hurting the environment and these communities for their own monetary benefit. Since 2009, Rhode Island Recycled Metals has conducted its operations without proper permits from the state, contaminating the Providence River and Narragansett Bay with runoff and fuel from unlicensed vessels and defying stormwater discharge permits. Even after a series of fires led to its temporary closure in 2024, attempts to bring the company into compliance continue to fail. Meanwhile, nearby communities continue to pay the price.
Over the past few years, government action has shown that the state prioritizes the interests of these industrial businesses over the wellbeing of affected communities. In 2019, Mayor Jorge Elorza applauded the industrial waterfront as a “driver of economic development.” And when asked why some businesses in the area were not being held accountable by the city for environmental violations, Elorza’s office told ecoRI News  that “the City is not responsible for air emissions or coastal regulations,” passing this responsibility to the DEM and Coastal Resources Management Council.
Mayor Brett Smiley’s 2024 Comprehensive Plan has taken a step in the right direction, but further action is needed. The plan emphasizes the development of clean and sustainable industries, laying out objectives to mitigate the environmental and health impacts of pollution. It also notes that “the city may prohibit future industrial uses in the General Industrial District, M-2, that it determines go against the public interest of public health and quality of life in near-industry neighborhoods.” However, will the state actually do this when the time comes? Or will more businesses like Rhode Island Recycled Metals be allowed to emerge? Without concrete accountability measures and enforcement strategies, these goals risk becoming empty words.
It is difficult to strike a balance between economic growth and public wellbeing, but it is essential that the state do so. Without immediate government intervention, the health of thousands of Rhode Islanders will remain at risk. Left to their own devices, these industrial businesses will continue to prioritize economic growth over public health.
Many residents worry that their voices will be drowned out by lobbyists and developers, who have greater influence in determining governmental outcomes. The state should propose an environmental justice law that will give residents in these communities a prominent voice in future developments. The state must enact legislation that reflects not only the interests of industrial developers, but also the concerns of those affected most acutely. Additionally, to decrease industrial operations in specific areas, the state should rezone parts of Allens Avenue and impose stricter penalties on businesses that violate environmental regulations.
I imagine a future where children can play outdoors without worrying about inhaling harmful pollutants – a future where every Rhode Islander has access to clean, healthy air. Thousands are counting on the state to act. 
So the question I ask is this: Will it continue to prioritize economic growth over people’s health, or will it finally listen to the voices of those crying out for help and deliver justice to these communities?

The scholarship program received a payment system update and will implement presumed eligibility for applicants going into the new year. (Photo by Maya Mitchell/New Hampshire Bulletin). As 2025 comes to an end, two new programs are being introduced to help child care providers make the most out of New Hampshire’s Child Care Scholarship Program: presumptive eligibility and prospective payments. 
The scholarship program helps eligible New Hampshire families pay for child care by providing direct payments for care to qualified early childhood and out-of-school providers for children under 13.
While the program allows child care providers to care for more children without taking on a heavier financial burden, some said the scholarship’s payment interface was challenging to navigate, the schedule for payment was not timely, and the scholarship applicant process can lead to loss of funds due to current eligibility requirements. 
To address those issues, House Bill 2, the state’s budget bill signed in June, included two initiatives to help ease the administrative burden of the program. 
Presumptive eligibility
Children and their families will soon be allowed to use the scholarship program before being formally approved. 
The pilot program will allow every applicant to be presumed eligible for the state’s scholarship program and receive financial assistance while undergoing the lengthy application process. 
Scheduled to start on Jan. 1, the new eligibility program will allow a family to receive benefits from their initial screening date through 60 days after, or to a date the Department of Health and Human Services determines as the “expiration of application submission,” as stated in the law.  
The current scholarship program application requires families to be interviewed and verified by the state in addition to providing identification and income documentation. A family must have selected a child care program by the end of the 30-day period — the total amount of time the application process should take, according to the Bureau of Child Development and Head Start. However, the process can take longer if a family does not complete the application correctly or encounters issues during the process. 
Program eligibility was expanded to include families earning up to 85 percent of the state median income, which was $113,431 for a family of four as of February 2024. According to the Carsey School of Public Policy, approximately 55,000 children were eligible for the scholarship program as of October 2024. According to Health and Human Services, 5,841 children are enrolled in the program as of November 2025. 
As the child care industry struggles with program capacity and workforce issues, increasing the number of children receiving care while maintaining a sustainable financial situation is important to most providers. Payouts from the scholarship program can contribute to salaries, benefits, food costs for students, insurance, and more. 
In a meeting with child care providers on Nov. 13, Jotham Spreeman, administrator of operations at the Bureau of Child Development and Head Start, said the pilot program should help improve cash flow for providers.
“This is going to allow a center to bill the state much earlier than previous,” Spreeman said. “It’s not necessarily going to be like day one [a child will] be in the system … as soon as that kid is in their care they’ll be able to bill for that kid.”
Providers and families will not be held responsible for the costs of care during presumptive eligibility, even if the child is found ineligible at the end of the application process. Applicants would, however, be liable for the costs in the event of “fraud or intentional violation of program rules.”
Additionally, the pilot program could be suspended “in the event of an active waitlist for the Scholarship,” according to Jake Leon, Health and Human Services director of communications and public information. Leon did not respond to questions about what could cause a waitlist to start. Currently, there is no waitlist for the scholarship program. 
The pilot program is being funded through $100,000 of federal funds, some of which is allocated to child care providers and to conduct a study on the program after it ends in 2027. New Hampshire joins four other states — Delaware, Maryland, Montana, and Wyoming — along with Monroe County, New York, in offering presumptive eligibility for child care subsidies. 
To qualify for the scholarship program, a child must be under 13 years old (or under 18 years of age if they have a disability); parents must be working, looking for work, or in a training program; and a family must meet certain income eligibility requirements. 
The scholarship operates on a cost-share model. Families pay a discounted rate to their child care provider and the state pays the difference of what a provider offers or the NH Weekly Standard Rate per child — whichever is less. Rates are based on a percentage of the family’s gross income and a family’s determined eligibility level, meaning the cost share amount varies from family to family. 
Prospective payment
On Dec. 1, Health and Human Services launched a new payment program that allows providers to bill the state a week in advance or at the beginning of each pay period for the scholarship program, a change from previous billing practices. Additionally, a new payment system interface was unveiled to providers to “streamline” the payment process. 
The budget law required Health and Human Services to establish new data entry requirements for the scholarship program to reduce administrative burden for providers. Using the new interface, providers are no longer required to report hourly attendance for scholarship recipients; instead, they will report the total number of hours a child is in care each week. 
Previously, providers had to enter the in- and out-times of scholarship children manually each day. Kitty Larochelle, executive director of The Growing Years in Manchester, said it took her “about 45 clicks” per child to enter information for each of her 40 scholarship students under the old system.
According to Spreeman, the goal is to help child care providers have a “steady stream of income” from the scholarship program and a “more predictable billing flow.” 
“That’s the hope, that this is going to level the playing field and stabilize cash flow for providers,” he said. 
Despite Health and Human Services providing training for providers at the end of November and early December, the process has not been straightforward for providers. During a Child Care Advisory Council meeting on Thursday, some providers expressed confusion with the new system to them. 
Larochelle told the Bulletin that the new system “doesn’t appear to take much off her plate” because it asks her to bill a week ahead while also requiring her to enter billing information from two weeks prior. 
“I have to change my processes and my thinking process in configuring my reports differently in order to report the total hours a child has been in attendance with us,” she said. “So now sitting down to do the week of Dec. 1, I had to go back and figure out a way to do my reporting to get the total amount of hours per child for the week of Nov. 17. It’s like a totally different thought process, because I’m potentially billing for next week, but looking at the hours for the week of Nov. 24.”

Health care advocates and researchers say the new year will be a challenging one for Ohioans with federal changes to health care coming with surety but uncertainty.
The Health Care Policy Institute of Ohio has conducted research throughout the years analyzing the impact of the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid funding on the ability for Ohioans to afford insurance, on top of all the others costs that households shoulder, such as food expenses and child care.
The uninsured rate in the state has dropped “substantially” since 2010, due in large part to the Affordable Care Act, according to Brian O’Rourke, a health care policy analyst for the institute. He also said in a recent webinar on the affordability of health care that more than one in five Ohioans had trouble paying off medical bills in 2023.
That rate was unsurprisingly higher among uninsured residents, but people with insurance also struggled, according to O’Rourke.
“Health expenditures are only one component of an Ohio household’s budget,” O’Rourke said during the webinar.
He cited United Way data that found a family of four in Ohio with two children in child care would need $79,224 per year to afford health care and other “essential needs.”
According to U.S. News and World Report, Ohio’s median income currently stands at $42,343.
Federal cuts to Medicaid mean Ohio is expected to lose $33 billion over the next decade, something Gov. Mike DeWine acknowledged will be an issue going forward.
“I think it’s going to pose some very significant challenges, and we’re looking at that,” DeWine said in a Thursday meeting with media. “…We’re aware of that and we have some tough decisions ahead of us, the state does.”
Health care workers and advocates are also bracing for change amid a deadlock in the U.S. Senate on proposals surrounding the Affordable Care Act. The lack of action makes it more than likely that the enhanced tax credits that are currently a part of the Affordable Care Act will expire in 2026.
According to the Health Policy Institute of Ohio, increased Affordable Care Act premiums stemming from the expiring tax credits could mean annual premiums will more than double in 2026, compared to 2025 rates.
Those increases are already showing up for those who go to Healthcare.gov to renew or purchase a plan during the open enrollment period, which lasts until Jan. 15. Increased premiums also include rate increases from insurers, according to O’Rourke.
So, with Medicaid cuts already set to impact Ohioans, and upcoming changes stemming from the federal budget reconciliation bill passed in July, Ohioans may have to make some tough calls when it comes to affording health care and anything else their households need.
The federal reconciliation bill also brings in new work requirements for Medicaid recipients and more frequent reassessments of eligibility for those in the system, something that will cause a lot of administrative and individual burden for Ohioans.
“Not only are (the changes) likely to lead to coverage loss, but we’re anticipating there will be significant churn where people are coming off and on coverage more regularly,” said Rose Frech, director of external affairs for the southeastern Ohio-based Integrated Services for Behavioral Health.
Having to abruptly end treatment for something like a substance abuse disorder because of coverage changes or a lack thereof “can become really life-threatening,” Frech said, and with services like hers in Southeast Ohio already operating on thin margins, adding another layer to the workload will only make matters harder where struggle already exists.
“This is just going to be kind of another strain,” Frech said. “And these things are things that families are experiencing in the compound.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXFamilies will face complicated decisions between medication, health care, transportation, food, and other things they need, not just one thing at a time, something advocates say policymakers need to keep in mind as they mull funding decisions.
“Very quickly we have seen … (news of the changes lead) to panic attacks, very high anxiety,” said Summer Kirby, chief executive officer of Portsmouth’s Compass Community Health. “There were experiences where medication affordability was just not an option.”
Choosing between food and other needs is something some Ohioans are already familiar with, as demand for help from food banks continues to rise.
“We are days removed from the federal (government) shutdown and still coming out of crisis response mode across our network,” said Grace Wagner, director of health initiatives at the Ohio Association of Foodbanks.
During the shutdown, the association saw a 46% increase in the number of individuals reaching out for emergency services, partly due to a pause in SNAP benefits as a result of the shutdown.
This was on top of demand that was already 41% higher than in 2022, and amid reductions in contributions from the USDA to food banks.
The food banks and health care workers are also working hard to give people the most up to date information, but the changes and uncertainty in how the changes will play out on a state level mean the groups are “weighing information paralysis,” as Wagner put it.
As the new year comes, Kirby said she and her team “consistently try to level-set” with the most current information, and ensure they have the contacts that are needed so people can get answers on all of the struggles that come with federal funding changes.
Advocates say they’re hoping for more interaction between legislators and the individuals who are impacted by the changes, so representatives can speak to their constituents’ entire struggles.
“We encourage policymakers to think about Ohioans as whole people,” Wagner said.

(Photo courtesy of Andrew DeMillo)After falling into his dream job covering politics 20 years ago, Andrew DeMillo embarks on a new chapter Monday as editor-in-chief of the Arkansas Advocate.
The nonprofit, online-only Advocate covers Arkansas state government and public policy, and DeMillo brings his two decades as The Associated Press’ Capitol correspondent to the task.
DeMillo succeeds Sonny Albarado, the Advocate’s founding editor, who will retire Friday after three years as leader of the outlet’s four-person team.
DeMillo said in an interview that what he admires about the Advocate’s role in the state’s news environment is its ability to do strong enterprise and investigative reporting as well as daily news.
“It’s good to have a news organization to step back from the process and look at the bigger picture,” he said. “It helps to find a way to cover stories differently. If we’re only offering a different version of what everyone else is doing, we’re not doing our best work.”
DeMillo said he’s looking forward to working with the Advocate team to break news and to take advantage of individual reporters’ strengths to expand the outlet’s multimedia reporting. The Advocate team includes Deputy Editor Antoinette Grajeda and reporters Tess Vrbin and Ainsley Platt.
“I’m also looking forward to writing a regular news analysis column,” he said, something he did for years at the AP. “I think there’s a hunger for that kind of analytical reporting.”

DeMillo came to Arkansas in 2002 after an internship at The Washington Post, where he was working during 9/11 and its aftermath. During the anthrax scare of 2001, he had to take a course of Cipro, the antibiotic prescribed for people who may have been exposed to the bacteria, after he was sent to a post office for the Post’s coverage. 
At the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette he covered city government, crime and national politics. He helped cover the 2004 Republican and Democratic national conventions, retired Gen. Wesley Clark’s presidential campaign and the construction of the Clinton Presidential Library in Little Rock.
He joined the AP in 2005 and said he thought he’d be doing general reporting, when the interviewer asked if he’d be interested in covering the Capitol, as one of the news service’s correspondents was retiring.
DeMillo enthusiastically said yes. In the years since, he’s become an integral member of the small group of journalists who report on the doings of the governor, executive agencies and lawmakers.
His reporting helped Arkansans see how state politics grew increasingly conservative and flipped the Legislature from a Democratic majority to a Republican supermajority. 
One of his earliest exposures to state politicians was through covering the Gillett Coon Supper, a traditional fundraising event for high school athletics in Gillett, Arkansas, that features wild game on the menu. Like state fairs in some states, the Gillett event typically draws many political candidates during election years.
Reporting on politics sometimes meant covering Arkansas stories that made national and international headlines, like the 2017 series of executions that then-Gov. Asa Hutchinson scheduled during a two-week period because an execution drug was set to expire and the drugs had become difficult to obtain. DeMillo said he even witnessed one of the executions, an experience that left an indelible memory.
In 2023, judges in the regional Diamond Journalism Awards named him Journalist of the Year for his reporting on the COVID-19 pandemic for the AP. The awards are sponsored by the Arkansas chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists. DeMillo also is a longtime member of the SPJ chapter’s board of directors.
DeMillo holds a degree in sociology from the University of Georgia, but found his calling working for The Red & Black, the independent student newspaper serving the campus. He’d always loved writing, he said, and enjoyed the fact that he could get paid for it.
And the sociology degree has proved useful, he said, by helping him see the impact of disinformation during his time in Washington, D.C., and by being able to discern when polling data was manipulated or untrustworthy.

Mike DeWine gives the State of the State address in the Ohio House chambers at the Ohio Statehouse on Wednesday, March 12, 2025 in Columbus, Ohio. (Pool photo by Samantha Madar, Columbus Dispatch.)There’s a little more than a year left in Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine’s tenure, and with time winding down he’s considering how best to secure his achievements before leaving office.
He also has a raft of important legislation on his desk awaiting a decision.
DeWine spoke about his plans at an annual breakfast for reporters hosted at the Governor’s Mansion in Bexley last Thursday.
Legacy
As he got up to speak, DeWine addressed the question of how he’ll wrap up his final year by holding up a little black box.
“This was given to me, actually, by former Governor Jeb Bush,” he said. “It’s a countdown clock. There’s exactly 395 days, 16 hours, 29 minutes and one second.”
He explained that ticking clock is encouraging his administration to approach its work with a “great sense of urgency.”
One of its central efforts has been tied to reading.
In addition to First Lady Fran DeWine championing the Dolly Parton Imagination Library — “We’re number one in the country,” she noted — Gov. DeWine has forced schools to adopt a phonics-based curriculum for teaching young readers as well as future teachers.
“That’s a very unusual thing to do,” he said, “but the evidence is just, as you’ve heard me say, it’s just absolutely overwhelming.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“Look, kids only have one chance to grow up,” DeWine added. “So if you miss that opportunity, the child cannot read. Yes, they can learn to read later, but it’s much more difficult.”
In line with that effort, the governor announced a vision care effort for kids earlier this year.
State law already requires basic vision screening, but many kids don’t get the follow up care they need. DeWine’s OhioSEE pilot program will use mobile clinics to serve students from kindergarten to third grade in 15 counties.
“One of my goals, frankly, is to demonstrate how effective this is, how cost effective it is,” he said, “so that when we leave office, it will be embedded, and the next governor will want to continue, not only continue it, but to expand it to all 88 counties.”
The short term
That next governor seems likely to be a departure from DeWine’s tenure.
If Ohioans elect a Democrat, like current front-runner Amy Acton, they’ll put a different party in the governor’s mansion for the first time since 2011.
If, on the other hand, voters choose the current GOP frontrunner, Vivek Ramaswamy, they’ll get a different kind of Republican.
Ramaswamy made a name for himself as a culture warrior, writing books criticizing “woke” politics before launching a quixotic presidential campaign premised on fighting the “secular religions” of “COVID-ism, climate-ism and gender ideology.”
When DeWine vetoed a measure banning gender affirming care for minors, Ramaswamy wrote on social media, “Shame on Ohio Governor Mike DeWine for this failure.”
DeWine insisted he plans to endorse the Republican candidate for governor “at some time,” but he has yet to formally do so.
The governor said he’s had policy discussions with Ramaswamy “and I’ve enjoyed those discussions,” but he was cagey about the delay.

There are two genders.
Boys shouldn’t compete with girls in girls’ sports.
Kids shouldn’t be subjected to genital mutilation & chemical castration when they suffer mental health lapses.
Shame on Ohio Governor Mike DeWine for this failure. https://t.co/bwD2Fj8ynz
— Vivek Ramaswamy (@VivekGRamaswamy) December 29, 2023

“We’re still having discussions,” DeWine said. “I want to get a better understanding of his positions, what his vision is, and I would say the discussions have been good. And obviously I want to talk to him about some of the things I see, as well.”
DeWine wasn’t particularly forthcoming about a major voting bill that landed on his desk Wednesday either.
The measure would invalidate any absentee ballots that arrive after Election Day.
Currently ballots postmarked before Election Day have a four day window for arrival.
The bill’s supporters, including Secretary of State Frank LaRose, readily acknowledge thousands of valid ballots arrived after Election Day in 2024.
But they dismiss them as a tiny fraction of the electorate and suggest voters will adapt to a changing deadline.
In 2023, when DeWine approved a photo voter ID bill, he said it should settle any questions about election integrity, “and I do not expect to see any further statutory changes to Ohio voting procedures while I am Governor.”
As for the pending bill, he said only, “I’m looking at it at this point, and we’ll have more to announce.”
The governor was more positive about a series of property tax measures and a recent cannabis measure hammered out between the Ohio House and Senate.
“Yes, I will sign the bill,” he said about the marijuana measure, praising it for addressing “juiced up hemp.”
The longer term
DeWine also offered a plea for compromise on redistricting and immigration.
Ohio’s redistricting debacle following the 2020 census left a bitter taste, and the governor has since called the Iowa approach.
There, nonpartisan legislative staff draw the lines and lawmakers take and up or down vote.
Now’s the time to pursue changes, DeWine said, with the next presidential election and census both a few years down the line.
“You know if there’s a citizen’s group that wants to put something like the Iowa plan on the ballot I’m going to be for it,” DeWine said.
The governor also described immigration as an opportunity, “whether or not we can take it, I don’t know.” DeWine noted he was in Congress the last time significant immigration policy was signed into law.
That was almost 40 years ago.
DeWine praised the Trump administration for dramatically reducing border crossings, but added, “That, to me, presents an opportunity to have a discussion about, what should legal immigration be?”
DeWine referenced Republican former U.S. Senator from Texas Phil Gramm’s contention that “there’s always room in the country for people who want to pull the wagon,” and said it’s “crazy” the way we treat foreign students.
“So, we’ve educated them here in the United States,” DeWine said, “they could have been a contributing factor to our economy, and to our country, and make our country better. And then many of them, we’re saying you have to go back.”
“Some of these things that we’re doing,” he added, “they’re not really good decisions.”

(Photo by Wichayada Suwanachun/Getty Images)A Nashua lawmaker has filed two bills related to New Hampshire’s health insurance industry: one would prohibit health insurers from using artificial intelligence to overrule doctors while the other would prevent insurers from reimbursing providers less money for equivalent services provided via telemedicine.
If enacted, House Bill 1406, filed by state Rep. Alicia Gregg, would prohibit health insurers from using AI to override or change the clinical judgment of a health care provider.
Several major insurance companies have begun using AI systems to automate claims and determine whether a patient’s care is medically necessary enough to warrant coverage — a trend that has correlated with an increase in patients being denied coverage. A September report from Experian found that 41% of providers said their claims are being denied by insurers more than 10% of the time. Three years ago, 30% of providers reported the same, according to the report.
The bill wouldn’t forbid insurers from using AI entirely. It would allow them to use it to search for fraud or internal audits. But it would require them to keep records of all AI tools they use in claims processing. The New Hampshire Insurance Department would then be able to audit insurers it believes are using AI in violation of this bill.
If New Hampshire adopted HB 1406, it would join several other states that have sought to curb AI’s use in insurance claims. In Maryland, Texas, Arizona, and Nebraska, policymakers have forbidden insurers from using AI as the sole decision maker for medical necessity denials or prior authorization, Stateline reported. A bipartisan bill in Pennsylvania also seeks to create similar regulations.
To Gregg, AI is inevitable, which is why legislation is needed early.
“We know that AI is becoming more and more prevalent in our society right now,” Gregg, a Nashua Democrat, said. “That AI, you can persuade it. You can manipulate it to have certain outcomes. While I think that might work money-wise for an insurance company that’s trying not to cover certain things, who we really leave behind is the patients.”
She worries AI’s “whole goal” when used by insurers is “to not have this coverage” in order to save money.
If the bill is passed and signed into law in the 2026 legislative session, it would go into effect in January 2027.
House Bill 1232, also filed by Gregg, would require insurers to reimburse providers the same amount of money for services provided via telemedicine as for in-person appointments. Insurers who violate this would be subject to a fine of up to $2,500 per violation.
“We have a situation where in a lot of areas, especially with cuts to certain medical programs, we’re going to see less and less in-person providers,” Gregg said. “So I’m always looking at what does access look like in our state.”
Gregg sees telemedicine as a way to increase that access, particularly in rural regions.
“When we have new technology, we start to bridge things,” she said. “We think of something as new or maybe radical or different than what we’ve had, but really, this is probably the next step in our medical care: being able to have telehealth visits.”
She said that when insurers don’t pay doctors the same for telemedicine, it “creates a financial disincentive for providers to offer the telemedicine.”
Gregg said one of her own care providers stopped offering telemedicine after the COVID-19 pandemic because insurance wouldn’t reimburse it even though it was more convenient for Gregg, an impetus for filing the bill.
If passed, HB 1232 will also take effect in January 2027.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/docmedicareadvantage-1024x617.jpg,,,2025-12-15 04:56:33.030971

Max McCoy brings us late-breaking history. I preside as ringleader over the entire affair. Mark — ever since his first column the summer of 2021 — watches this state and its people with a keen eye and big heart. He speaks out for the little guy. And he doesn’t put up with any nonsense from those in power.


We’re just the latest stop in a distinguished career. Mark grew up in Wichita and attended the University of Kansas. He worked in Louisville, Kentucky, then spent nearly 14 years as an editor and columnist at the Wichita Eagle. He subsequently spent years in the nonprofit sector, including nearly a decade at the Kansas African American Museum.
Despite that hefty resume, Mark’s not an egotistical kind of guy.
“I guess I could say this now, because I’m in,” he told me on the Kansas Reflector podcast. “But when I found out what they had said about me in nominating me, it was almost like I had already won.”
To celebrate this modest firebrand, let’s take a look at five of his Kansas Reflector columns, starting with the first, all the way back in June of 2021.
What the Kansas attorney general needs to know about critical race theory (June 8, 2021)

Critical race theory’s only error is its name. It isn’t a theory at all. It represents the lived Black experience. And I haven’t mentioned red-lining, environmental racism (Flint, Michigan), police terror, mass incarceration or how the government typically rammed interstate highways through Black communities.
Race remains an organizing principle in America. Any racial reckoning requires an understanding of this fundamental fact. From the Three-fifths Compromise, to the U.S. Supreme Court’s Dred Scott ruling that enslaved people had “no rights the white man was bound to respect,” to today.

Despite Barry Sanders averaging 30 yards a carry in his first three games as a receiver at our Wichita high school, head coach Dale Burkholder said the athletic director warned him not to start Barry at running back.
But for Burkholder’s advocacy — defiantly starting Barry at running back and then producing a highlight reel and shopping it to universities — Barry might have found his own dreams deferred.

Celebrating Brown v. Board at 70: Hallowed but hollow for too many Kansans (July 2, 2024)

Why celebrate Brown as a triumph when so much of the country reflexively rejects virtually any attempt at addressing these old wrongs? We still don’t know if we’ll ever become the country we claim to be. Brown offers the perfect mirror.
The decision helped much of the country understand that even if physical facilities and other factors were equal, segregation still harmed Black children. It found this kind of separation unconstitutional.
Brown remains, for many, hallowed but hollow.

At disciplinary hearing targeting Black Kansas lawmaker, ancient tropes and selective outrage (April 15, 2025)

Rep. Ford Carr and supporters in the gallery for his disciplinary hearing must have felt as though Kehlani and Dreamville penned the lyrics of their haunting 2023 R&B hit “Shadows,” about them. The hearing unfolded with painful familiarity and hypocrisy.
Tropes, hundreds of years old. Ancient double standards. Selective outrage.
Those there supporting Carr had decades of the Black experience in the workplace under their belts and, like him, have had to walk around with their defensive dukes up. Jobs are minefields, where your ability to clothe and feed loved ones often is arbitrarily threatened.

This only covers a fraction of Mark’s work for us. He’s already sent in a new column that should appear this week. I’m always honored to edit and present his writing.
We can always use a confident, experienced voice of conscience.

(Photo by Troy R. Bennett/ Maine Morning Star)Transgender students in Maine public schools this year faced more than twice the threats, violence and bullying of their peers, according to new state data — disparities advocates say are worsening as political attacks on LGBTQ-inclusive school policies escalate.
They were also more than four times as likely to attempt suicide, and more than three times as likely to self-harm through cutting or burning themselves, according to the latest Maine Integrated Youth Health Survey, which was conducted Feb. through March 2025 and studies the mental and physical health of students 5th grade and older. 
Trans students, who make up almost 4% of high schoolers and 2% of older middle schoolers in the state, have been disproportionately impacted by bullying and poor mental health, according to several years of data. Since the survey began asking about gender expression in 2019, that trend has remained consistent. 
Whether that disparity has continued in the current school year is not yet known, but it’s something the Department of Health and Human Services, which publishes the survey every two years, will be looking for in the 2027 survey, according to Sheila Nelson, who oversees adolescent health for DHHS.
The anti-trans rhetoric that has ratcheted up under the second Trump administration and its scrutiny of Maine’s inclusive policies, coupled with recent legislative attempts to walk back protections for trans students and a handful of local school boards rescinding those rights have all played a role in making LGBTQ+ students, particularly trans youth, feel unsafe at school, advocates told Maine Morning Star. 
“When we have school boards that are changing policies that say, ‘You don’t matter and you don’t know you shouldn’t exist,’ and then those things are getting implemented in schools, that sends a huge message,” said Sue Campbell, executive director of Out Maine. “And that is going to make it even more difficult for our young people in schools and in communities.”
Across the three reports the Maine Department of Health and Human Services released last month, trans students reported the highest rates of bullying and being targeted for their perceived gender expression or sexual orientation. About 21% of all high school students reported being bullied, but double that percentage — nearly 43% — of trans students said they had experienced bullying at school. More than half of the more than 25,000 children in 7th and 8th grades reported being bullied at school last year, which increased to more than 78% of trans students.




“Since we’ve started asking questions about sexual orientation and gender identity on the survey, we have seen these differences around bullying and harassment as well as many other health indicators for LGBTQ+ young people,” Nelson said. 
“It’s not new, but it is concerning,” she added. “It’s one of those long term, really persistent health disparities that we’ve seen.”
Surveys from 2023 and 2019 also show comparable percentages to 2025 of total students who said they were bullied at school, and trans students who experienced bullying at double the rate. The 2021 reports show an overall dip, but that could be attributed to students studying remotely because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Across several years, two-thirds of trans high schoolers reported experiencing offensive comments or attacks at school because of their perceived gender expression or sexual orientation, indicating that the bullying trans students face in schools is directly related to their identity. Middle schoolers were not asked that question.
“We know that those experiences in school have a big impact on young people’s ability to learn and their ability to feel safe at school, and ultimately, their ability to enjoy all of the things that we want young people to be able to enjoy,” Nelson said.
According to the 2025 report, 8% of total students skipped at least one day of school because they felt unsafe, which increased to 13% of LGBTQ+ students and almost 20% of trans students. Overall, more than 86% of all high school students and 80% of middle schoolers felt safe at school, but only 67% percent of trans students in high school and 50% of those in middle school did.
“When students don’t feel safe at school and they’re hurting, like LGBTQ+ students are, that affects just not just them, but it affects their friends and their families and their classmates, and it erodes what communities are supposed to be,” said Gia Drew, executive director of Equality Maine and a former high school teacher and coach.
That’s reflected in the disproportionately high number of trans and LGBTQ+ students who shared in the latest survey that they experienced depression, planned or attempted suicide, and engaged in self harm, such as cutting or burning themselves.
According to the high school report, 63% of trans students and 52% of LGBTQ+ students reported feeling sad or hopeless to the extent that they stopped doing daily activities. Of all high school students, 5.6% attempted suicide in the past year, whereas 23% of trans and 13% of LGBTQ+ students did.
“People should be horrified by these statistics and recognize that we’re talking about children — and all children, regardless of their identity, should feel safe,” Campbell said. “And when they don’t, that’s on the adults for not doing the right thing.”




Prevention
The Maine Department of Education and DHHS have both been working on prevention to improve overall student well-being and provide additional mental health support in schools as well as increasing professional development for teachers. The health department has been more focused on community resources, such as partnerships to improve mental health resources for students outside of schools. Both agencies believe that building a supportive climate for all students will eventually benefit LGBTQ and trans students. 
Although trans students continue to be severely impacted by bullying and more prone to depression or hurting themselves, there are some positive signs in the 2025 report compared to two years prior. About 10% fewer students reported feeling sad or hopeless and about 7% more said they felt safe at school between 2025 and 2023.
The education department works with school leadership organizations such as the Maine Principals Association and the Maine School Boards Association to offer models of affirming policies for schools, which Bear Shea, who leads the team focused on school climate and mental health, said are important to ensure students feel safe at school.
“So really it’s looking at, what are the policies, what are the legal pieces that are in place, and how are those being used,” Shea said. For example, looking at whether students are referred to by their chosen names in learning platforms.
But recently, school administrators have been wary of utilizing such evidence-based supports that affirm students’ identities because of the politicization of inclusive policies, according to Drew and Campbell. 
“I think there were administrators around the state that really wanted to know what life was like for their students and they were trying to make changes,” Drew said. “But so much of that has been under attack that it’s now dangerous to do those things, and it looks like kids are paying the price.”
Out Maine, which works with both the health and education departments to offer school trainings and community events, has been hearing from LGBTQ students that they’re afraid to come out at school or use the bathroom. Anecdotally, Campbell said more families, particularly with trans kids, are choosing to homeschool. 
Part of that is because LGBTQ resources are vanishing from all aspects of school life, including Gay Straight Alliances — of which there were dozens around the state a few years ago —cultural awareness training for teachers, and LGBTQ representation in school curricula, Drew said. 
The Maine DOE’s resources can be useful if schools chose to utilize them, but the department can’t mandate any school to implement these practices. This local discretion opens the door to anti-trans groups or parents pressuring districts to walk back affirming policies, curricula and teacher trainings.
“It doesn’t seem like the state has the authority to make those changes happen at the local level, so how do local communities see this as a really pressing issue and demand more from their schools?” Drew asked.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/cumberland-trans-rally-6-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-15 04:56:33.030971

(Photo courtesy of the National Renewable Energy Lab.)Last year, I was called to testify at a hearing of the Ohio Power Siting Board on a plan to develop a large solar farm in Knox County. 
My firm Scioto Analysis was asked to make some estimates about the cost of climate change for local governments in Knox County and how the solar project could help make up for these costs in the long run.
I was surprised to see the level of scrutiny this project was undergoing. 
Installation of a large, clean power project that will bring plentiful, low-cost energy is not something that I would generally expect to be controversial. 
But grassroots groups had organized against the project, making dubious claims about environmental impacts and arguing that the project would be “unsightly.”
It has always seemed strange to me that neighbors can have so much of a say in what people do with their land. 
If a farmer finds it is more profitable to install solar panels than to use land for soybeans, why can their neighbors go to state boards and argue against that use of their land?
The fundamental argument for this sort of community input in these sorts of projects is that energy developments can have external impacts on community members. 
If you build a coal-fire power plant next door and upwind of an elementary school, you expose children on the playground to PM2.5 and NOx emissions, which can cause breathing problems and in extreme cases, death. 
Community input helps alert policymakers to these sorts of problems and improve energy projects for the community they are located in.
On the other hand, there is such thing as “too much community input.” 
If bad actors abuse the system, the community input system ends up being a tool for slowing or even killing projects. 
The Icebreaker Wind offshore wind project in Lake Erie is one example of this. It has dealt with years of delays, mainly at the behest of people who have aesthetic opposition to wind turbines.
This past week, Scioto Analysis released a report with the Ohio Chamber of Commerce Research Foundation on energy permitting in Ohio. 
In the face of growing interest in Ohio as a data center hub, many people are worried about Ohio’s ability to keep up with the energy needs associated with these projects. 
An efficient energy permitting process is a key to making sure enough energy is available to continue to have these sorts of centers in the state without subjecting the state to soaring energy costs.
Using data from Lawrence Berkeley Laboratories on energy projects in the development queue, we estimated that the state of Ohio loses out on 9,000 megawatts of energy projects per year due to developers withdrawing their projects. 
This amounts to about $440 million in lost investment every year, 5,400 fewer jobs, and millions of dollars in lost tax revenue.
There needs to be space for community input. But if the state of Ohio is going to keep up with energy needs and keep energy prices from skyrocketing, it means balancing those needs with the need for energy supply. 
Making sure the process serves the needs of ratepayers as much as it serves the needs of residents who find solar panels and wind turbines “unsightly” is paramount to an effective system.

(Jane Norman/States Newsroom)Imagine new parents born and raised in Nebraska wondering if their bouncing bundle of joy is truly an American. Weird, huh?
Let’s start at Grand Island’s Howard Elementary School when the world had fewer sharp edges and television was turning to color. That’s when sixth graders there could try out to deliver the oratory “I Speak for Democracy,” in front of an assembly of students and parents. Aspirants had to memorize the 700-odd words. While I put in the work, I bowed out before auditions, the smart play since brilliant and formidable future scientist Nancy Johnson was among the competitors. 
Among a few words and phrases I remember are these, confirmed by Google: “I am an American.” Apparently sixteen-year old Elizabtheth Evans who wrote the essay knew she was.
She used those four words to begin the first, fifth and penultimate lines of her paean to democratic principles. She wrote them in 1953, about the time U.S. Sen. Joe McCarthy was looking for commies in State Department closets and under Hollywood Hills beds, so her warnings to fascists and communists rang true for McCarthyites. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
She also paid homage to America’s “melting pot,” our vast assortment of cultures, religions and people, what some today call the “salad bowl.” Whatever name one uses for our heterogeneous home, I’m afraid Elizabeth’s work — even by its “Wonder Year” standards — would today run afoul of the “woke” police, those anti-D.E. I. nosey parkers preaching the goodness of homogenization and the evils of diversity.
“I Speak for Democracy” came to mind recently after I read that the U.S. Supreme Court said it would hear arguments that could end birthright citizenship. The case is fueled by a presidential executive order, one of many that have undone much of the government’s processes and procedures and certainly impacted our economy. 
The High Court’s decision to essentially entertain just who is an American stopped me cold.
That’s because at issue here is the Constitution’s 14th Amendment, which clearly says if you’re born here, you are a citizen: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.” That’s how I became an American. Elizabeth Evans, too. My guess is that’s how you did, as well. 
Specifically, the January 2025 order — blocked by a number of lower courts — would exclude from U.S. citizenship any infant born to a mother illegally in the country and a father who is neither a citizen nor permanent resident. Babies born to a mother with temporary status and a father who is neither a citizen nor permanent resident would also be denied citizenship.
Details aside, the administration’s headlong rush to deport immigrants once again comes face-to-face with the 14th Amendment, an obstacle to carrying out its crackdown on those in the country without permission, although horror stories are plentiful of American citizens and those here legally being arrested or detained. 
Would SCOTUS really upend a constitutional amendment? Why not involve Congress, should that august assemblage want to leave the sidelines where it has been the last 11 months? Why not give the American people a voice in the matter? 
Instead we have the highest court in the land listening to an argument that an executive order can undo a constitutional amendment and nearly 130 years of precedent.
SCOTUS’s case poses larger questions, too. Who is an American? Who gets to decide who is an American? Can an executive order undo other amendments such as speech? Or the right to bear arms? The 14th Amendment undid the Supreme Court’s most dubious decision: the 1857 Dred Scott decision. 
Justices then determined that those of African descent — slave or free — were not citizens and, as such, had no legal standing to seek a legal solution in court. In other words, not really Americans. 
Scott and his wife Harriet had argued that living in a free territory — Wisconsin — made them free citizens. SCOTUS disagreed, handing down what many legal scholars consider a low point in the High Court’s history. The 14th Amendment rectified the Dred Scott decision, but not before it became a compelling force on the march toward the Civil War.
You’re right. The Supreme Court hasn’t made a decision in this case. Still, the idea that a president could undo a constitutional amendment with the High Court’s blessing once seemed unthinkable. 
Not any more — and along with it, a potentially new definition of who and what exactly is an American.

I’m CalMatters investigative editor Andrew Donohue, and I’m subbing for Lynn today.
The state Employment Development Department acquired 7,224 cellphones and wireless hotspots in the pandemic so call center employees could work from home. 
Then it forgot to cancel them once nobody was using them. 
As CalMatters editor Adam Ashton reports, that’s how the agency – in charge of distributing benefits to millions of suddenly unemployed Californians in the pandemic – racked up $4.6 million in monthly service fees. 
The details come from a new state audit detailing wasteful spending at several government agencies. Auditors began looking at the cell phones after receiving a tip. 
Department officials told auditors they were unaware of the spending, but auditors pointed to regular invoices from Verizon that showed which phones were not being used. 

The audit: “We would have expected EDD management to have reconsidered the need to pay the monthly service fees for so many devices that had no voice, message, or data usage.”

More on EDD: After the pandemic, we investigated breakdowns at EDD that left the state with the worst of both worlds: tens of billions of dollars lost to fraud, and workers who lost their financial stability, their homes or, in extreme cases, their lives. Read the full series here.More audits: Despite spending hundreds of millions of dollars to fill vacant medical and mental health positions at prisons and state hospitals, California has little to show for it, Kristen Hwang reports.

GOP could be losing key constituency

From CalMatters’ politics reporter Maya C. Miller:
A recent survey of Latino voters in California finds that Republicans appear to be losing ground with a subset of the electorate who voted for former President Joe Biden in 2020, but who President Donald Trump wooed in last year’s presidential election. 
The findings from Latino advocacy group Tzunu Strategies and pollster Tulchin Research provide one of the clearest indicators yet that the GOP in next year’s midterms might not be able to count on a key constituency that returned Trump to office. 
But Arturo Carmano and Ben Tulchin, the poll’s architects, caution that Democrats shouldn’t view their findings as a “comeback” for their party just yet. Instead, they emphasized to leaders of both parties that Latinos care more about which candidates make them feel heard and valued, not partisan allegiance.

Tulchin: “When (Latino voters) feel unheard or taken for granted, they can and will move. Parties cannot assume their support — they have to work for it.”

The survey of 1,100 registered California Latino voters — 100 of whom switched from Biden in 2020 to Trump in 2024 — also found that respondents had largely negative views of the economy and influence of corporate power. 
Nearly 70% of those surveyed said they felt American immigration enforcement operatives are racially profiling Latinos, including 59% of Biden-to-Trump voters. 



Camping ban challenged in court

From CalMatters homelessness reporter Marisa Kendall:
Two homeless Californians are suing the city of Fresno, claiming an ordinance that prohibits camping anywhere in the city is unconstitutional.
Fresno is one of many cities around California that passed anti-camping ordinances after the U.S. Supreme Court gave them the greenlight to do so in 2024.
The plaintiffs, 78-year-old Wickey TwoHands and 52-year-old Joseph Quinney, were both arrested on suspicion of violating the camping ban last year. They are seeking to challenge the ordinance in federal court on behalf of all unhoused people in Fresno. 

The lawsuit: “Defendants have created a regime that punishes poverty, destroys personal property without due process and subjects vulnerable populations to arrest, harassment, and danger without providing adequate shelter alternatives or reasonable accommodations.”

Fresno’s response? We’ll see you at the Supreme Court.
City Attorney Andrew Janz: “I look forward to taking this case to the Supreme Court – the same Supreme Court that upheld this sort of ordinance. Again, the municipal law passed by the Fresno City Council does not punish housing status, just behavior.”



And lastly: California to be hit hard by AI executive order

Last week, President Donald Trump issued an executive order that’s likely to hit California the hardest. 
The order discourages state governments from regulating artificial intelligence and urges Congress to pass a law preempting such regulations. California has passed more laws to regulate artificial intelligence than any other state since 2016. We’re also home to many of the world’s leading AI companies.
As CalMatters reporter Khari Johnson writes, polls show that AI regulations have broad public support.  
In October, one poll found that nearly 80% of Californians strongly or somewhat agree that safety should be prioritized over AI innovation. A September poll found that four out of five Americans want lawmakers to prioritize safety over innovation, even if that means the technology is developed more slowly.






California Voices
The Trump administration and its policy allies have outlined plans to significantly restrict access to CalFresh, the state’s anti-hunger program. But research shows that work mandates do not increase employment and instead often result in eligible families being cut off from critical food benefits, writes Hannah Mudgett, who is pursuing a master’s in public health at University of California, Berkeley.

(Getty Images)Remember the War on Christmas, when conservatives worked themselves into a lather over America-hating freaks wishing people “Happy Holidays,” putting on community celebrations called “Winterfest” instead of  Christmas or parking a Festivus Pole next to a Manger Scene?
Or the Black Santa phenomenon, which so horrified Fox News’ Megyn Kelly she felt compelled to declare “Santa is white”?
Good times.
Right-wingers’ obsession with what they see as secular assaults on Jesus and the fiesta of capitalism with which we mark his birth are no longer confined to December.
The craziness has metastasized, blown past December into the rest of the year, expanding faster than plans for the White House ballroom.
It’s not just for Christmas anymore: According to MAGA politicians and their hangers-on, there’s now a full-blown War on Christians.
When Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier discovered a city-owned theater in Pensacola was hosting “A Drag Queen Christmas” on Dec. 23, he blew a gasket.
The show features stars from “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” one of the most popular television programs in America.
“A Drag Queen Christmas” is touring the United States, appearing in mainstream venues such as the Knoxville, Tenn., Civic Center and Atlanta Symphony Hall.
If you didn’t know better, you’d think a whole lot of regular Americans like drag shows.
James Uthmeier is not among them. In a ranty and perhaps a tad prurient letter to the Pensacola City Council, the fellow who likes to call himself “Florida’s Top Cop” expressed outrage over Pensacola children taking pictures with Santa outside while “men dressed as garish women in in demonic costumes will be engaged in obscene behavior mere feet away.”
More equal
According to Uthmeier, “The show openly mocks one the most sacred holidays in the Christian faith” and must be canceled post-haste.
He goes on, noting, “A previous production featured a male performer boasting the stage name Trinity ‘The Tuck’ Taylor — a not-so subtle stab at THE fundamental doctrine of Christianity.”
The city of Pensacola has refused to shut down the show.
Perhaps Uthmeier has decided he no longer need concern himself with school shootings, environmental poisoning, and other minor inconveniences, and can devote all his energies to protecting the faith.
While he loudly threatens to throw the book at real or perceived incidents of antisemitism, really the only faith he’s most interested in protecting is his own.
Just ask the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Muslim civil rights organization, suing Gov. Ron DeSantis over his dubious (and likely unconstitutional) attempt to designate them as “terrorists.”
Uthmeier’s chomping at the bit to defend that case.
I guess all religions are equal, but some religions are more equal than others.
Those of us attached to, say, facts, evidence, reality, that stuff, know there is no War on Christianity, any more than there is now, or ever was, a War on Christmas.
America has no Emperor Diocletian ordering the Roman army to take their axes to Christians or roast them on grates, no Boko Haram murdering Christian children, no Chinese secret police arresting pastors.
Especially in Florida.
Here we see increasing attacks on Muslims, assaults (both physical and statutory) on LGBTQ people, and out-and-proud racism: Florida leads the nation in hate groups.
Apostasy at SCOTU?
Uthmeier is on a crusade (and I use that word advisedly).
He’s angry at the American Bar Association for investigating the St. Thomas University College of Law, a Roman Catholic insitution in Miami.
The ABA accredits law schools, making sure they’re in good financial shape, they don’t discriminate, they’re fair in hiring and retention, and they treat people equally.
Seems St. Thomas didn’t exactly ace the test.
Uthmeier could have helped STU clean up its act. Instead, he wrote one of his belligerent letters, accusing the ABA of being “woke” lefties practicing “religious discrimination” against Roman Catholics and said the organization cannot use its “accreditation monopoly to put law schools to the tortuous choice of accepting the ABA’s discriminatory, repugnant standards or suffering the fallout of withheld accreditation.”
This might be a good time to mention that Uthmeier is a product of Georgetown Law School, a Catholic institution duly accredited by the ABA.
Instead of, say, working to stop gun violence, domestic abuse, and insurance fraud (to name but a few of the state’s besetting issues), he signed on to a brief supporting a couple of Christian schools’ desire to pray over loudspeakers before their football games.
Courts pointed out the schools would be proselytizing using public spaces with publicly funded sound systems, which suggests government endorsement of a particular religion.
They said no.
The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the appeal.
Uthmeier huffed, “The Constitution does not require state-sponsored hostility toward religion.”
Undaunted, he wrote a stiff note to Microsoft about the mega-corp.’s policies toward software discounts for faith-based groups.
Microsoft is, he said, “hostile” to Christian nonprofits.
The governor’s Bible
Among the nonprofits he’s referring to are so-called “Crisis Pregnancy Centers,” which claim to provide “medical care” for desperate young women who don’t want or can’t care for a child.
The young women at these places get a lot of guilt-inducing fundamentalist propaganda, but no information on how to get an abortion, even if they want one.
By the way, these CPCs are largely funded with taxpayer money.
Lately, the governor’s been going around boasting Florida has been named the No. 1 state for religious freedom.
This distinction was conferred by First Liberty Institute, a conservative legal outfit, the ones who went to the U.S. Supreme Court to save a pious Oregon pâtissière from having to make a gay wedding cake.
Hooray for the Sunshine State.
Nonetheless, DeSantis, Uthmeier, and D.C. MAGAs say the fight to save Christians from secular, indeed, Satanic, persecution remains urgent.
In 2024, Donald Trump campaigned on made-up stories of crazed heathens somehow banning the phrase “Merry Christmas” and, even weirder, destroying crosses: “They want to tear down crosses where they can, and cover them up with social justice flags.”
(Side note: Anybody know where I can buy a “social justice flag”?)
Trump added, “I’m a very proud Christian.”
Ron DeSantis is also a “proud Christian,” so pious that for the swearing-in at his first inauguration, staff had to order a Bible from Amazon for $21.47.
He didn’t own one.
Florida Woman and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, yet another proud Christian, has established a Justice Department task force to combat “anti-Christian policies.”
Members of this task force include such noted followers of Jesus as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.
Perhaps the Spanish Inquisition will provide a useful model for them.
Who’s really being persecuted?
But let’s go back to Pensacola’s “Drag Queen Christmas.”
Uthmeier assumes that the very idea of a man rocking a smokey eye and glittering evening wear is so inherently sinful any exposure to such a thing imperils your immortal soul.
Why, what if a child picks up a stray, wind-borne sequin from Jewels Sparkles’ dress? Will the parents need to call an exorcist?
The attorney general and his fellow hysterics might be interested to learn some drag queens are Christian.
One, a fabulous red-headed singer sporting the splendid name “Flamy Grant,” topped the Christian music charts with the 2023 album, “Bible Belt Baby.”
Let’s smack Uthmeier, DeSantis, et al. (gently) with the reality stick:
There is no persecution of Christians in America.
The persecuted are those who belong to disfavored cultures — Afghan or Latino or Black — those who express their sexuality in a disfavored way or speak out disfavored opinions.
You can’t find anything in the New Testament where Jesus endorses cruelty or murder.
The Great Commandment (Matthew 22:39) says, “Love thy neighbor as thyself.”
The foreigner, the exile, the refugee should be welcomed to your country (Matthew 5:43, Hebrews 13:1, Romans 13.10).
There’s no mention of rounding them up, beating them, and sending them off to torture prisons or countries where they’re likely to be killed.
Jesus did not endorse bombing people clinging to a capsized boat.
Jesus didn’t say to torment people over their sexuality or their fashion sense.
Sure, Deuteronomy 22:5 says women shouldn’t dress as men (better lose those pantsuits, Bondi!) and men shouldn’t dress as women, but Deuteronomy also says if a wife tries to save her husband from an attacker by grabbing the guy’s genitals, she must have her hand cut off (25:11-12); you can’t eat pork, shrimp, or lobster; and if you commit adultery, you will be stoned to death.
I doubt the president and his Secretary of Defense would want to embrace that one.
The point is, what Uthmeier, Bondi, Hegseth, Kennedy, Trump, DeSantis, and their ilk espouse is performative hatred, not Christianity.
Perhaps we should all pray for them.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-497510068-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-15 00:56:57.905586

(Maryland Matters illustration)While Gov. Wes More (D) awaits an advisory commission’s decision on whether to engage in midcycle redistricting of congressional districts, a new poll gives insight into how Maryland residents feel about it.
In short, they are not fans.
The poll by the Institute of Politics at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County said that 81% of Marylanders polled said purposely redrawing congressional district lines to favor one party over another is “a major” problem for American democracy.
“I think it’s important to keep in mind that there are a lot of things going on, not just in Maryland, but nationwide, right?” said Mileah Kromer, director of the poll.
Besides seeing partisan redistricting as a major problem, the poll also showed a majority of Marylanders would prefer to separate elected officials from the redistricting process. Nearly two out of three voters said they would prefer a nonpartisan, independent commission to handle redistricting. Only 12% said they favored a system where elected officials draw the lines.
Former Gov. Larry Hogan (R) repeatedly proposed such a panel during his two terms, and appointed one to draft a plan in the 2021 redistricting process. The Democrat-controlled General Assembly instead named its own panel and approved the map it drafted, which was later struck down in court.
The poll surveyed 801 Maryland adults, including 769 registered voters, between Dec. 2 and Dec. 6. The margin of error for both pools of respondents is plus or minus 3.5%.

The poll would seem to be bad news for Moore, who has pushed for redistricting, and seemingly good news for Maryland Senate President Bill Ferguson (D), who has been equally steadfast opposed.
It follows weeks of hearings by the Governor’s Redistricting Advisory Commission in which testimony was mostly split. The latest meeting was Friday.
Moore appointed the commission as a precursor to joining a national effort by Republicans and Democrats to engage in hyper-partisan, mid-decade redistricting. President Donald Trump (R) touched off the tit-for-tat redistricting by pushing Texas to redraw its lines to favor Republicans. California responded by redistricting to favor Democrats, and neutralize Texas’ changes.
Moore has repeatedly said that he just wants to make sure that Maryland’s maps are fair. But he has also acknowledged that the effort is a response to the national push, saying in October that the state is “not going to bend the knee to Donald Trump.”
Democrats account for 51.5% of all registered voters in the state, while Republicans and unaffiliated voters make up a little less than 25% each. Even so, seven of eight congressional districts are held by Democrats.
The UMBC poll asked Marylanders about the current maps, finalized three years ago. Those who answered agreed with Moore that the maps are not fair: A plurality — 41% — said the maps are unfair, about 28% deemed the maps fair, while 29% said they didn’t know.
“Our numbers definitely suggest that people do recognize that they’re unfairly drawn,” Kromer said.
But there is some disagreement on who benefits the most. Of those who said the maps were unfair, 33% said the current maps favor Democrats, while just 8% said Republicans are favored.
The responses should not come as a shock, Kromer said.
“I think anybody who’s paid any attention feels that this is not big news that people think that,” she said.
‘Nuanced opinions’
The poll found that 30% were paying a lot of attention to the redistricting machinations in the state and 29% were paying “some” attention. Another 18% paid “a little” attention and 17% had not paid attention at all.
Of the 77% who said they paid at least a little attention to the issue, 40% said they do not like the idea and that it should not be done. About one in five said they do not like it, but it is necessary, while 7% said they like it even though it’s “the wrong thing to do.”
Another 24% said they liked the idea and that state leaders should redraw the maps.
“I think that folks have this sort of nuanced opinion,” Kromer said. “Those people, I think, are the most interesting.”
Those with nuanced opinions are “probably people who could be moveable on the issue,” except for the fact that redistricting is “not that big a priority,” Kromer said.
Pocketbook issues override redistricting concerns
In general, the UMBC poll found most Marylanders have other issues on their minds.
Pocketbook issued topped the poll’s list of priorities, with 25% focused on the economy, jobs, and cost of living, followed by taxes, the budget, and government spending at 23%. Just 15% focused on topics of government leadership, politics, and democracy.
“There’s a considerable difference and what people prioritize in the state,” Kromer said. “When economic anxiety is high and people are worried about the everyday cost of living. it is hard to get an issue like this [redistricting] to break through.”
When asked what issues should be a “high” priority for state government, the cost of health care, the quality of K-12 public education and reducing crime/improving public safety were each ranked as high priorities by 73% or more of those asked.
About 67% ranked taxes and fees paid by residents as a high priority, followed by the cost and availability of housing, and household energy costs at 65% each. Another 61% rated economic growth and development as a high priority.
Two transportation issues made the list: About 42% rated the quality of roads and highways as a top priority, and 34% said the same about the availability and quality of public transportation.
Redrawing congressional district lines came in last. Just 27% said it was a top priority.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Untitled-design-72-1024x683.png,,,2025-12-15 01:59:29.597876

My son Jesse was killed in the deadliest shooting at an elementary school in U.S. history, Sandy Hook.
Like so many families who experience unimaginable tragedy, I was left searching for answers, for meaning, for some way to make sure no other child, no other family, would ever have to endure such pain.

Scarlett Lewis

In the days and months that followed, there was enormous pressure to join existing movements, to lend my voice to causes that were already loud and well-funded. I understood the urgency. I understood the grief. But deep in my heart, I knew those paths would not have helped my son. And if they wouldn’t have helped Jesse, I couldn’t believe they would truly help others.
I didn’t want to fight against something. I wanted to be for something. I wanted to heal.
Just days before Jesse was killed, he wrote three words on our kitchen chalkboard, “nurturing, healing, love.”  He spelled them phonetically, in the sweet, imperfect way children do. At the time, I had no idea how much those words would come to mean. Now, they guide everything I do.
In the weeks after the tragedy, letters poured in from strangers; parents, teachers, children, and people who simply cared. One letter from a professor who had spent decades studying school violence stopped me in my tracks. He wrote that after all his research, he believed it came down to one simple truth:“If a child receives just fifteen minutes of a caring adult being fully present, truly seeing them, truly caring, that child can be okay.”
I carried that letter with me everywhere. I still do.
It’s true of us all. We all have the want and need to be loved. When children feel loved, they don’t want to hurt themselves, or anyone else. That belief became the foundation of the Jesse Lewis Choose Love Movement.
Today, Choose Love has reached millions of children around the world. But at its core, it remains deeply personal. It’s about making sure no child feels invisible. No child feels alone. And no child believes violence is the only way to be seen or heard.
Jesse’s life mattered. His message matters. And if we can honor him by showing up for children, with patience, compassion, and love, then his legacy will continue to change the world, one heart at a time.

Bridgeport is a city with a proud past, and has faced its share of economic challenges, but it has continued to work through redevelopment. Today, it is still a place where hard working families and college students strive everyday to make a better life. But, there’s a danger lurking underground that has not been discussed enough: the lead contamination in our water.



Recent testing in Connecticut has revealed that many schools and buildings still show high levels of lead. Lead is a toxic metal that can have serious health risks, especially for children. Lead has been known to permanently damage the brain and nervous system. It affects IQ levels, and causes learning and behavioral problems.
As a student living in Bridgeport, I see first hand how this issue affects everyone. This means spending extra money on bottles of water and ice, just to protect yourself from the danger that should have been eliminated decades ago.
There is never a safe level of lead exposure. These consequences are life long and irreversible.

Grace Gaffney

In a city with aging infrastructure and older housing stock, Bridgeport residents face a persistent risk from lead pipes and fixtures that carry our water. Many schools and public buildings in the area were constructed decades ago, before modern safety standards banned the use of lead materials in plumbing. Families in Bridgeport that already struggle with the economic hardship at hand, should not have to worry about the water that is coming from their faucet. Clean drinking water is a basic human right, not just a privilege that is reserved for healthier towns. Safe water should not depend on your ZIP code or your income.
Connecticut has made some progress. State law now requires school and child care centers to test their water for lead and to publicly report the results. There have also been grant programs to help communities replace old plumbing. But, Bridgeport specifically needs more support. The city and the state must work together because this is still not enough. Even with the testing, it identifies the problem, but it doesn’t fix it. There needs to be full funding for remediation, not just testing. We could start fundraising by planning a community based project such as donation drives and partnership campaigns. This funding will replace fixtures, remove lead components in older buildings, and upgrade plumping in school systems.
This is about our collective future. Every child deserves the opportunity to grow and thrive without being poisoned by the water they drink, which shouldn’t even be a factor. Every family should have their own piece of mind knowing that their tap water is not only running, but is safe to drink.
We cannot let another generation of children suffer from a problem that is solvable.There needs to be a better corrective plan for Bridgeport. Community development should not be held back from the lead that is still in our water. This needs to be treated with the seriousness it deserves. This is the city’s future depending on it. It’s time for Bridgeport and Connecticut to fully commit to a lead free future.

The […],"The suspected shooter is shown taking a right on Waterman Street after leaving the Barus and Holley engineering building Saturday. Police say they cannot tie this man to the man detained at a Coventry hotel. (Screenshot from Providence police video)Providence police say they will release the man apprehended at a Coventry hotel early Sunday morning as part of their investigation of the mass shooting at Brown University’s engineering and physics building.
The surprising news came at a twice delayed press conference that began shortly after 11 p.m. at the Providence Public Safety Complex. The press conference was originally slated to begin at 10:30 p.m. and then 10:45 p.m.   
“I’ve been around long enough to know that sometimes you head in one direction and you have to regroup and go in another and that is what has happened over the last 24 hours or so,” Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said.
The press conference came hours after national news outlets had already named a 24-year-old Wisconsin man, citing law enforcement sources speaking on condition of anonymity. The Associated Press had reported that police had seized two handguns and two loaded 30-round magazines when the man was detained at the Hampton Inn in Coventry.
“What is really unfortunate that this person’s name was leaked to the public,” Neronha went on. “It’s hard to put that back in the bottle.”
Neronha declined to say what eliminated him as a person of interest.
Meanwhile, officials are still not releasing the names of the victims in the shooting, which killed two students and wounded nine others. Eight students remain hospitalized at Rhode Island Hospital.
Providence Mayor Brett Smiley said that the search will continue for additional video evidence. Residents living near the Brown University campus, particularly along Hope and Waterman streets, who have doorbells that record motion, are asked to upload any videos recorded after the shooting happened Saturday around 4 p.m. to a designated page on the FBI website.
Smiley said residents and business owners in the area who have video from that time can also call police at (401) 272-3121.
When a reporter asked Neronha if the person of interest would be exonerated in writing, after having his name nationally broadcasted in relation to a mass shooting, Neronha opted to sketch “a clear picture” of case law and the duration of forensics.  
“We can detain someone for a reasonable period of time if there is evidence as such that points to that person being involved in criminal activity,” Neronha said. “So you know, evidence doesn’t appear on your doorstep and you have answers to it within the first 15 minutes.”
Evidence, Neronha added, takes time and testing to confirm. Some tests can take an entire day to perform. 
“So over the course of the day, while we’re following up leads elsewhere, those initial leads may come back positive or may come back negative,” Neronha said. “Here they came back negative.”

Neronha got testy once more when a reporter asked about the availability of any additional video evidence. Smiley was at the podium, but Neronha’s voice boomed forward in reply. 
“If we had that video, you’d have it,” Neronha said. “Obviously, if there was, if there was a piece of video [where] we can show you a face and say, ‘This is our person of interest, or suspect,’ you’d have it.”
Asked about the possibility of additional video — whether from cameras at Brown or in the surrounding area, like homes or businesses — the AG offered a more resigned reply. 
“We’re not holding back video,” Neronha said. “We’re not holding back video that we think would be useful, and I don’t think I should even have to say it.”
The Barus and Holley engineering building where the shooting occurred is an older building with few cameras, Neronha said.
Still, Neronha said, officials cannot divulge everything. “We have a murderer out there, frankly,” he said. “And so we’re not going to give away the game plan.”
Smiley said the individual would “shortly be released” from the Providence Police but did not give a specific time.  
Smiley pledged to provide additional updates as the investigation continues.
“The community deserves to know the progress we are making in this investigation,” Smiley said. “I imagine that the Providence community feels a little bit more anxious than they did an hour ago, and I understand that.”
At a press conference Sunday morning, Providence Police Chief Col. Oscar Perez was cautious in choosing his words to describe the status of the person of interest as being detained and not in custody. Perez had stopped short of saying the man apprehended in Coventry was the same man wearing all black shown walking on Hope Street and taking a right on Waterman Street in the video police released Saturday night.
Asked by a reporter if the man detained was the same man in the video, Perez was clear. “We do not have enough evidence to corroborate that,” the chief said.

(Photo posted by Meskwaki Nation Police Department Facebook page)The Meskwaki Nation police chief has identified his son as one of the two Iowa National Guard members killed in Syria Saturday.
The two service members were killed by a lone gunman suspected to be affiliated with ISIS, according to information released Saturday. The identities of the soldiers who died in the attack were not officially released as of Sunday evening, but Iowa Army National Guard officials were expected to officially share more information after next of kin has been notified.
In a social media post late Saturday, Meskwaki Nation Police Chief Jeffrey Bunn wrote that his son, Sgt. Nate Howard, was one of the soldiers killed in the attack.
“My wife Misty and I had that visit from Army Commanders you never want to have,” Bunn wrote. “Our son Nate was one of the Soldiers that paid the ultimate sacrifice for all of us, to keep us all safer. He loved what he was doing and would be the first in and last out, no one left behind. Please pray for our Soldiers all around this cruel world.”
No information has yet been shared about the second soldier or civilian victim of the attack.
Gov. Kim Reynolds and Iowa National Guard Maj. Gen. Stephen Osborn confirmed Saturday the two soldiers killed in the Palmyra, Syria, were in the Iowa National Guard. Three other soldiers were injured in the attack — one of the injuries was “superficial,” Osborn said, while two others were “significant,” and both were stable but in critical condition receiving treatment at the Jordan air base. One civilian, an interpreter who was not from Iowa, was also killed in the attack.
Reynolds asked Iowans during a Saturday news conference to “stand united” in supporting the victims, their families and all National Guard service members, “especially those who served side by side with the soldiers killed and wounded today,” following the attack.
“Everyone who wears the Iowa National Guard uniform — I can tell you firsthand that this is a family,” Reynolds said. “I’ve seen them close up, working together in any number of challenging situations, and they share a deep bond. Today’s attack and the loss of two of their own weighs heavily on everyone at every level, so please keep all of them and your thoughts and prayers.”
The attack, currently under investigation, occurred “as the soldiers were conducting a key leader engagement,” according to Sean Parnell, the U.S. assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs. The soldiers’ mission was in support of ongoing counterterrorism efforts in the area. Osborn said at the Saturday news conference the Iowa National Guard forces in Syria operate as a part of the Combined Joint Task Force Operation Inherent Resolve, an international union led by the U.S. focused on fighting ISIS in the region.
“Our soldiers were doing their job, serving with courage, dedication and professionalism,” Osborn said. “They carried out their mission to the best of their ability, and we are proud of their incredible service and sacrifice, and we will continue to stand strong as a team united in the purpose and resolve their mission.”
There are currently 1,800 Iowa soldiers in the Middle East, Osborn said, deployed in May 2025. Of that group, between 200 and 250 are National Guard members deployed in Syria.
President Donald Trump pledged a strong U.S. response to the ISIS attack in a Truth Social post Saturday mourning the deaths of the three Americans.
“This was an ISIS attack against the U.S., and Syria, in a very dangerous part of Syria, that is not fully controlled by them,” Trump write. “The President of Syria, Ahmed al-Sharaa, is extremely angry and disturbed by this attack. There will be very serious retaliation.”
Other Iowa leaders shared their condolences for the fallen soldiers and their families following the news Saturday. U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst, a veteran who served with the Iowa National Guard, asked Iowans to join her “in praying for the families of these American heroes.”
“Our Iowa National Guard family is hurting as we mourn the loss of two of our own and pray for the recovery of the three soldiers wounded,” Ernst said in a statement. “These soldiers were carrying out a critical mission in combatting the threat of ISIS and keeping our homeland safe from the threat of radical Islamic terror. This tragic attack is a reminder that freedom is not free and that every American owes an enormous debt of gratitude to our brave men and women in uniform who put their lives on the line every day.”
The last death of an Iowa National Guard member in service occurred in 2011 in Afghanistan.
Iowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart said the deaths of the Iowa National Guard members was “absolutely shocking news” in a statement Saturday.
“The National Guard represents the best of us – citizens always ready to protect and serve their neighbors,” Hart said. “May the families of these brave Iowa soldiers know that the entire state of Iowa grieves for them and send our sincerest sympathies to them for their unbelievable loss.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/nationalguard.photo_-1024x725.jpg,,,2025-12-14 20:57:43.623622

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)PROVIDENCE — It was supposed to be a joyful event. But a Christmas tree and menorah lighting scheduled for late Sunday afternoon at Lippitt Memorial Park was turned into a vigil for the victims of Saturday’s shooting at Brown University.
Despite the mid-20-degree weather and falling snow in Providence, over 200 people gathered to light candles to honor the two students who were killed and nine others who were wounded inside the Barus and Holley engineering building.
Councilor Sue AnderBois began the holiday event at the park near the Pawtucket line last year.
“Instead, we are gathered here to share light with one another in one of Providence’s darkest times,” AnderBois told the crowd. “We’re here together to be together and to support.”

AnderBois was joined by several of Rhode Island’s elected officials including Gov. Dan McKee, who earlier in the afternoon ordered flags at all state buildings and facilities to be lowered to half-staff as a sign of respect for the victims of the shooting.
McKee did not speak during the vigil, nor did most elected officials in attendance. Remarks during the 10-minute ceremony were given by AnderBois, Mayor Brett Smiley and Sarah Mack, senior rabbi of Temple Beth-El near Wayland Square in Providence.
Smiley, who converted to Judaism last year, invoked the first night of Hanukkah in his remarks, noting that the initial lighting of the menorah represents a small spark that grows into a bright light by the end of the eight-night festival. He said he hoped the vigil would be “the first little flicker for our community to start to heal and get better together.”
“It’s going to be a long road, but what I know about this community is that we will be here for one another,” Smiley said.
Mack similarly spoke of the need for Rhode Islanders to come together as a way to provide light in these dark times.
“We can use our light to kindle other lights — to care for one another,” she said. “That is how we get through this dark moment.”
After Mack concluded her speech, the crowd spontaneously began to sing “Amazing Grace.” Officials had no further press briefings scheduled for Sunday night on the status of their investigation.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)The person of interest detained overnight as part of the massive investigation of Saturday’s mass shooting at a Brown University engineering building has yet to be criminally charged. Two people were killed and nine were injured.
A man in his twenties was apprehended early Sunday morning at a Coventry hotel, approximately 15 miles away from the Ivy League campus in Providence. But Col. Oscar Perez, chief of Providence police, declined to say if he is the same person of interest depicted in video footage released by law enforcement Saturday night.
“We’re in the process of collecting evidence. We’re in the process of typing search warrants as needed and we’re in the process of doing what we need to do in order to get those items,” Perez told reporters at a noon press conference at the Brook Street Station at the edge of Brown’s East Side campus.

“While it may be frustrating for certain members of our community to feel like we’re not being fully forthcoming with details, the reason is that we’re not sharing details that are unconfirmed is that it could compromise our prosecution,” Providence Mayor Brett Smiley said.
As Perez was taking a question from a reporter who used the term “custody” referring to the person of interest, Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha, the state’s top prosecutor, who was standing beside Perez leaned in.
“Custody’s the wrong word,” Neronha whispered to Perez.
Providence Mayor Brett Smiley said he had spoken to four of the eight shooting victims who were still hospitalized at Rhode Island Hospital. One had been discharged. Brown President Christina H. Paxson said she had spoken to all but one of the hospitalized students. 
Brown is not yet releasing names as not all victims’ families have been notified. Paxson on Saturday night confirmed that she had spoken to the families of the two students who died.
As the noon press conference was happening, news crews from around the region waited outside the Hampton Inn on Centre of New England Boulevard in Coventry. Crime scene tape blocked off the entrance to the hotel while FBI and ATF agents were inside. But details about the progress of the investigation were scarce.  
Law enforcement agents were seen looking inside vents below two windows on the first floor of the hotel’s west side. They pointed to an upper floor.

FBI Director Kash Patel in a social media post Sunday credited a lead called into Providence Police, describing a “person of interest in a hotel room in Coventry,” as the impetus for the search team’s successful apprehension of the suspect. The search team included members of the FBI Boston field office’s Safe Streets Task Force, along with the U.S. Marshals Service and Coventry police, according to Patel.
“This FBI will continue an all out 24/7 campaign until justice is fully served,” Patel wrote on X.
Kristen Setera, a spokesperson for the FBI, referred to Patel’s social media post when asked for additional comment Sunday.
A dispatcher for the Coventry Police Department declined to answer questions when contacted by phone Sunday afternoon, referring a reporter to the local FBI office. 
Federal investigators are still working to gather evidence and reconstruct the shooting scene. They have also set up a digital portal to take in photos and videos submitted by the public that might be helpful, Patel said on X.
Perez repeatedly declined to answer questions about the person of interest, how he was found, or any potential connections to the university, explaining that he did not want to compromise the ongoing investigation.
“I’m pretty confident in the work that the men and women have done for the department, but I gotta respect their work,” Perez said. “Some of them haven’t gone to sleep. I have to respect the fact that they’re going to continue to give us what we need in order to be able to prosecute somebody properly.”

Perez rebuffed questions about lack of camera footage from the university’s expansive footprint across College Hill, including in the engineering building where the shooting took place. 
The university relied on its internal text message alert system to tell students, administrators and faculty about the situation. But the three outdoor sirens across its main campus were not activated due to the fast-moving nature of the crisis, said Rodney Chatman, the university’s director of public safety and emergency management.
Smiley acknowledged the need for further scrutiny about safety measures and policies at a later date.
“There will be plenty of time to talk about what advocacy and policy changes should be made but we’re still very much at work at the task at hand, and that is to be able to bring charges forward on the person responsible,” Smiley said.
By midday Sunday, evidence of the crime scene that engulfed the residential neighborhoods around the university had been removed. All roads were reopened except for the immediate area around the Barus and Holley engineering building on Hope Street, Smiley said. City officials and law enforcement expect to provide more updates when available Sunday but from a different venue: the Providence Public Safety Complex on Washington Street in downtown.
Somber Sunday on campus
About an inch and a half of snow dusted the campus overnight through Sunday morning. An impromptu memorial of flowers had formed outside Brown University’s Engineering Research Center around noon. Standing alone at the display was Katelyn Meyer, a Ph.D. student in chemical engineering.
“It’s so quiet this morning,” she told Rhode Island Current. “On the one hand, it feels kind of peaceful. On the other, it feels very somber.”
Meyer works inside the Barus and Holley engineering building — a structure she assumed would be safe in the event of a lockdown. There are no windows inside, all the doors are cinderblock — some of which require keypads to open, Meyer said. She had been scheduled to be in her office Monday, but the engineering building continues to be an active crime scene.
“I’ll be honest, I really don’t want to go back in,” Meyer said.

Paxson got emotional at the end of the press conference as she described talking with students at the university’s main dining hall Sunday morning.
“It is a big shift and not the way we hope to end this semester obviously,” Paxon said.” A lot of students gathered there. They are amazing, and they are supporting each other. … The students on campus There’s just a lot of gratitude right now. They’re remarkable.”
Brown continued to inform its campus community and the public with updates to its website.   
An update from Brown’s ​​Vice President for Campus Life Patricia Poitevien posted to Brown’s website at 12:03 p.m. listed resources for students still on campus, such as food and the availability of police escorts to help students retrieve their belongings from dorms. 
“When I was at the hospital today, one of the students that showed tremendous courage literally said to me, ‘You know that active shooter drill they made me do in high school helped me in the moment,’” Smiley said during the press conference, “which at the same time provided me hope and was so sad. We shouldn’t have to do active shooter drills but it helped.”

Courtesy photo. Kendall Qualls, Army veteran, former health care executive and anti-anti-racist activist, won the Minnesota Republican gubernatorial straw poll on Saturday, beating House Speaker Lisa Demuth, MyPillow guy Mike Lindell and a long list of other names.
The poll of the party’s State Central Committee offers the first look at how the candidates in the 2026 governor’s race are positioned among roughly 300 of the party’s most engaged activists leading up to precinct caucuses on Feb. 3, which will begin the process of selecting the 2,300 delegates to the party’s all-important endorsement convention in May.
Qualls won votes from 93 delegates, followed by Demuth with 90 and Lindell with 49, according to the state party.
Much can change before the party convention, and candidates with weak showings in the straw poll have gone to win the MN GOP nomination. Former state Sen. Scott Jensen finished third in the first Republican straw poll but won the party endorsement in 2022. (Jensen, who is running again, finished seventh this year.)

“I’m a unique candidate as a political outsider and business leader who can energize Republicans and attract a sizable share of swing voters — enough to win decisively in 2026,” Qualls said in a statement celebrating the results of the poll.
Qualls, although popular among party activists, has never won a general election. He finished 11-points behind former U.S. Rep. Dean Phillips in 2020 to represent the purplish suburban 3rd Congressional District. In 2022, Qualls finished behind Jensen at the state nominating convention.
In recent years, Qualls has led the nonprofit Take Charge Minnesota, which promotes “the notion that the promise of America is available to everyone regardless of race or social station,” according to its website.
Demuth led House Republicans during the 2024 election to win a share of power in the 67-67 House, effectively thwarting the Democrats’ legislative agenda this year.
Both frontrunners are Black, which would be a first for Minnesota if either prevails in the Republican primary and against Democratic Gov. Tim Walz in 2026.
Lindell, who’s lost a fortune promoting false claims about rigged election machines, announced his campaign for governor on Thursday from his Shakopee pillow factory and livestreamed it on LindellTV with fellow right-wing influencer and former Trump advisor Steve Bannon.
Prominent attorney Chris Madel celebrated his fourth place showing behind Lindell in a news release, saying he was “genuinely amazed by the level of support shown by delegates from across our great state.”
Rep. Kristin Robbins, a suburbanite whose relative moderation might be an asset in a midterm election that usually favors the party not in the White House, finished a distant sixth.
She entered the race early and has used her position as chair of the House fraud prevention committee to raise her profile by pummeling Walz over fraud in state-run human services programs.
What’s unclear at this point is the role of President Trump in the nominating contest. Lindell has long portrayed himself as a Trump ally, including long-running amplification of Trump’s false claims about the 2020 election. Robbins scrubbed her support for Nikki Haley — who ran against Trump for the GOP nomination in 2024 — from her social media.
Trump and the MAGA movement seem to have a particular disdain for Walz and may be calculating who has the best shot at beating the two-term DFL incumbent.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMGL0519-1024x658.jpg,,,2025-12-14 11:57:29.560874

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota’s success rate for keeping truancy cases out of court is the lowest it’s been in a decade, according to an annual report presented to a state committee.
The Juvenile Justice Reinvestment Oversight Council is a group of representatives from law enforcement, schools, the Legislature, social services and the court system. It is responsible for tracking South Dakota’s efforts to reduce the number of children in custody.
The group first came together in 2015, following a set of juvenile justice reforms meant to address South Dakota’s status at the time as the state most likely to lock up children. The number of delinquency petitions has decreased from 3,025 in 2014 to 2,489 in 2025.
A delinquency petition is a legal document that launches the juvenile court equivalent of an adult criminal case. Diversion programs typically allow children to avoid such a petition.
Truancy diversion programs redirect chronically absent students and their families away from the justice system by providing support and services to address the cause of the absenteeism.
‘Big gray area’: SD authorities fear alternative instruction means ‘no-schooling’ for some students

The success rate of truancy diversions dropped to 63% in fiscal year 2025, which ran from July 2024 through June 2025. That rate has declined from a high of 97% in 2021.
Truancy can be more than students not attending school, State Court Administrator Greg Sattizahn said at the meeting, since it can be a “reflection of a lot of other things happening” in the child’s life, including “breakdown in a family structure,” abuse or neglect, criminal activity or substance abuse.
“A $100 fine as diversion is not going to address that meaningfully,” Sattizahn said, adding, “There is just a lot that you have to unpack in those truancy cases, so they continue to be a challenge.”
Truancy diversion success rates significantly dropped in fiscal year 2023, following a 2021 law making it easier for parents to pull their children from school and place them in alternative instruction, such as online schooling or homeschooling.
The law change struck down testing requirements and instruction time requirements, and removed a clause that allowed the state’s Department of Education to investigate situations where there’s concern a child might not be getting the instruction they’re required to under state law.
Committee member Rep. Mike Stevens, R-Yankton, told South Dakota Searchlight that the report overall shows that the2015 changes have been largely effective. But truancy, he said, is a “big area that we have to look at as a state.”
Truancy diversions have decreased since the 2021 truancy law changes took effect, gradually dropping to 270 in 2024 and 171 in 2025. There were 694 diversions in 2021 and 565 in 2022.


Parents can avoid potential truancy charges by signing their kids up for homeschooling without accountability, Stevens said.
“We don’t know where those kids are going to school. That’s a real issue,” Stevens said.
Because parents can more easily remove their children from schools, he said, it gives the state less opportunity to intervene.
Stevens plans to address truancy this coming session with a proposal to require families who enroll their child in alternative instruction to tell the state each year where their child is receiving their education.
“I have no problem with someone homeschooling their child or sending them to private school. But there are kids out there that we don’t know if they’re going to school or not,” Stevens said. “That’s a real concern and something that could easily be taken care of.”
Committee member Sen. Red Dawn Foster, D-Pine Ridge, hopes to better understand the “root causes” of youth involvement in the justice system and the overrepresentation of Indigenous people in the criminal justice system.
In the case of truancy, she wants to understand the connection between academic achievement, educational opportunities and truancy rates. Foster works with the Boys and Girls Club in Pine Ridge.
Foster told South Dakota Searchlight that understanding ways to not only divert children from the justice system but address “root causes” is more urgent as the Legislature discusses prison construction and rehabilitation reform.
“As Native people, we understand what is happening in our community, and a lot of times we don’t have the resources or data to do something about it,” Foster told South Dakota Searchlight. “If you have the right resources and access to data, you can support others doing phenomenal work to address these issues.”

Police announced they identified and apprehended a person of interest early Sunday morning. (Google images)The shelter in place order on the Brown University campus was lifted early this morning after the arrest of a person of interest in connection with Saturday’s mass shooting that killed two students and injured nine others.
“The people of Providence should breathe a little easier this morning,” Mayor Brett Smiley said at a 7 a.m. press conference at the Brook Street fire station near the Brown campus. “The investigation with regard to the individual who has been detained is very much ongoing and in the middle of it right now, but we’re providing this update specifically so that the people of Providence can breathe a little easier this morning.”
But police activity will continue in Barus and Holley Engineering Building and the surrounding area that is still considered an active crime scene, according to officials.
Providence Police Chief Col. Oscar Perez declined to share any details about the person in custody or where they were arrested, citing the ongoing investigation into the shooting. All he’d noted was that the person was in their 30s.
WPRI-12 reported that the person was taken into custody without issue at 3:45 a.m. at the Hampton Inn and Suites on Center of New England Boulevard in Coventry. The town’s police department did not immediately respond to request for comment.
A woman who answered the phone at the Hampton Inn said she could not give out any information at this time. “We are working with law enforcement,” she said.
Perez told reporters detectives are now collecting evidence and conducting interviews as part of the investigation.
“From there, we’ll be able to, when it’s appropriate and accurate, to share more details with you all,” he said.
Gov. Dan McKee told reporters the Rhode Island State Police will remain on alert to provide a “sense of calmness in the state.”
“The state of Rhode Island is in shock,” McKee said. 
Of the nine students who were injured and taken to hospital Saturday, seven were in a stable condition, one was in critical but stable condition, and another had been released, Smiley said. 
University President Christina Paxson said Sunday morning the shooting happened inside a classroom where an exam review for an economics class was underway. The Providence Fire department was first alerted about the shooting at 4:05 p.m. 
Brown sent out its first emergency alert at 4:22 p.m., noting “an active shooter near Barus & Holley Engineering.” 
All remaining undergraduate and graduate exams, medical classes, papers and projects for the rest of the fall 2025 semester have since been canceled, Provost Francis J. Doyle III wrote in an update to students at 8:24 a.m.
“In the immediate aftermath of these devastating events, we recognize that learning and assessment are significantly hindered in the short term and that many students and others will wish to depart campus,” Doyle wrote.
Paxson said a couple of thousand students were transported overnight by law enforcement from locations within a police perimeter to an evacuation site in the Olney-Margolies Athletic Center. “We prioritized getting those students to a place where they could rest and receive any necessary resources,” she wrote in a university update. “I am deeply moved by all the students who opened their homes and their arms to welcome friends into their dorms and other residences while we transported others to local hotels.”
The Rhode Island Blood Center put out a call for blood donations.
“Hospitals rely on a ready supply during emergencies,” the Center posted to X.

But their vital work continues to be underpaid, across the country, throughout the state of Michigan, and even here at the University of Michigan (U of M).
The university’s ECE teachers are part of University Staff United, a newly recognized union who is fighting for a contract that would include higher wages for many of the university’s lowest paid full-time workers, including the early childhood educators at all three campuses’ children’s centers.
When I joined Towsley Children’s House in 2012 as a recent graduate with a bachelor’s degree in education, I was offered just $27,000 per year. While the university offered generous health and retirement benefits to offset the lower salary, I was not able to live independently on this wage. I first lived with roommates and then my spouse, who made twice what I made. Even with yearly merit increases, I could only afford to pay about a third of our joint expenses.
After six years at Towsley, we decided I would accept a job at a school in China that paid me twice what I was making at U of M. I had to leave the country to find a school that was willing to pay me a competitive wage! When we moved back to Michigan in 2023, I applied back to Towsley and was offered $42,000. I was eager to return but, as a certified teacher with a Master’s Degree in Early Childhood Education, this was significantly less than what I could earn in area districts like Ann Arbor Public Schools. ECE teacher compensation has been a topic of conversation and concern throughout my time at U of M.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In 2014, teachers had an informal meeting with HR, where we shared our worries and low pay. Many teachers spoke about how difficult it was to cover all their living expenses without a second job or a spouse. The university’s response was to say they were paying the market rate for ECE teachers and our salaries were not going to change. In 2021, two Towsley teachers spoke anonymously to the Michigan Daily to discuss pay equity for ECE teachers at the university.
The teachers highlighted important aspects of this issue. For example, only a small percentage of our budget comes from university funds. This places the burden of paying our salaries on the families we serve. One of these teachers noted,“The university expects the child care centers to pay for themselves, which in turn raises tuition costs, which is a burden to families and it doesn’t allow for the teachers in our programs to make a living wage.”
In 2023, the University’s Business and Finance division (which oversees Human Resources, Child and Family Care, and the Children’s Centers) rolled out a compensation framework that capped the salary of different roles within the division. Children’s Centers ECE teachers were informed that their maximum salary would be $55,210, regardless of educational attainment or number of years worked at the university.
The most senior teachers, who had regularly received annual merit raises putting them above that salary threshold, were told they had reached their salary cap and would never make more. Understandably, some teachers felt undervalued and chose to leave.
The University of Michigan is not alone in under-paying ECE professionals. Across the country, many of these teachers are paid at or below the federal poverty level and few states are making an effort to change that. Early educators, in particular, are penalized for working with young children. Michigan early educators with a bachelor’s degree are paid 21.5 percent less than their colleagues in the K-8 system. Imagine how the conversation around early childhood educator pay could change with the support of a great institution like the University of Michigan.
Teaching at one of U of M’s Children’s Centers is an honor and a privilege. We provide some of the highest quality early childhood education and care available in our city, county, and state and the quality of our programs are used to attract professionals to the university. It’s time that we are recognized and compensated for being the leaders and the best in our field.

,Mississippi Today,2025-12-14 12:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Donald Trump wants to abolish federal independent boards. Could that occur in Mississippi?,Bobby Harrison,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/12/14/donald-trump-independent-boards-mississippi/,It would be difficult for the state Supreme Court to rule that a board created by the Mississippi Constitution is unconstitutional.,"The state government of Mississippi is packed with agencies and commissions that are governed by independent boards and not by the governor.
President Donald Trump argues such independent boards on the federal level violate the United States Constitution. The Supreme Court recently heard arguments from the Trump administration on the issue, and a ruling next year in favor of the president would be far reaching and upend decades of judicial precedence.
Not long ago, a ruling of the U.S. Supreme Court abolishing the independent or regulatory boards would have been far fetched, but no longer thanks to the current Supreme Court’s willingness to acquiesce to Trump’s whims.
Is the same possible in Mississippi?
Could Gov. Tate Reeves or some future governor challenge the constitutionality of the independent agencies in this state?
Perhaps. 
After all, anybody can file a lawsuit. And it often appears that whatever Trump does, Reeves and many Mississippi politicians want to emulate. But there are some distinct differences between the powers of the governor under the Mississippi Constitution and the powers of the president under the United States Constitution.
Granted, the U.S. Constitution and Mississippi Constitution are similar in terms of the president and the governor both commanding the military, having broad pardon authority and being able to request reports from agencies.
Both the U.S. Congress and the Mississippi Legislature have created agencies with governing board members appointed by either the governor or the president. Often, the board members serve staggered terms, preventing one chief executive officer from appointing all the members.
The purpose of the independent boards – especially on the national level – is to take politics out of the governance, such as with the Federal Election Commission, the Federal Reserve, the National Labor Relations Board, the National Science Board and a host of others.
Trump wants to be able to fire the board members if he does not like their policies.
Mississippi also has multiple instances of the Legislature creating a governance system where appointed board members hire the executive director and set the policies of the agency. The Department of Mental Health, the Department of Health and the Community College Board are examples where, for whatever reason, the Legislature opted to create an agency with the executive director reporting to the board members instead of the governor.
But there are differences between the Mississippi system and the national system.
Some of the independent agencies are created by the Mississippi Constitution (the people) and not by the Legislature.
The Board of Education, arguably one of the state’s more important boards, is created constitutionally with the members appointed by a combination of the governor, lieutenant governor and speaker of the House. The state’s eight public universities are governed by a constitutionally created Board of Trustees of state Institutions of Higher Learning. The board members serve staggered terms appointed by governors. In some rare instances, one governor elected to two terms could have all the appointments on the IHL Board.
Then, of course, there are statewide elected officials who oversee their agencies. Most of those state positions – the secretary of state, treasurer, auditor, attorney general – are created by the Constitution and do not answer to the governor. But the insurance commissioner and the commissioner of agriculture and commerce are not constitutional officers. They are legislatively created.
It is not certain the U.S. Supreme Court will grant Trump’s wishes and abolish the independent boards, but many judicial experts believe it is possible if not likely.
But what is certain is that Mississippi’s Republican leadership follows the lead of Trump.
Still, it is difficult to see a scenario where a Mississippi governor would take the issue to court.
First of all, it is highly unlikely that the Mississippi Supreme Court would find a board or agency created by the Mississippi Constitution to be unconstitutional. That would be a difficult position for a judge to take.
In addition, a governor who has a strong relationship with lawmakers might have better luck changing the governance of those independent agencies that are not in the Mississippi Constitution by going to the Mississippi Legislature instead of petitioning the Mississippi Supreme Court.
But in the current crazy political climate, it seems anything is possible.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/07003107/MG_1584-scaled.jpg,,,2025-12-14 07:56:22.369106

Screenshot

Winooski Superintendent of Schools Wilmer Chavarria testified on Capitol Hill last week about his detention earlier this year by federal authorities in Texas. He filed a lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security the day after testifying, alleging violations of Fourth Amendment protections at the border.
“I accepted to be a plaintiff for this lawsuit because, if we are successful, it can protect the Fourth Amendment rights for all Americans,” he said in an interview with VTDigger.
Chavarria, 36, said he was detained by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials in Houston’s airport on a trip back from visiting family in Nicaragua in July. Federal agents denied him legal counsel, searched his devices without a warrant and told him he did not have constitutional rights at the border, according to the complaint filed in U.S. District Court Wednesday.

“CBP policies that claim to give its employees the power to search and seize electronic devices without a warrant violate the Fourth Amendment and therefore should be set aside,”said a press release from the Pacific Legal Foundation, which is representing Chavarria. 
At the Dec. 9 public forum in Washington, D.C. held by U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal, D-CT, and U.S. Rep. Robert Garcia, D-CA, Chavarria spoke about his experience being detained and what it means for his future.
“Since this incident, I do not feel free to travel. I am fearful that a visit to my mother could mean extended detention or a fabricated plot to destroy my life, like they threatened to do,” he testified. “If the goal is to make some citizens feel like they are of a second class, with only some of the rights but not others, then they have succeeded.”
Born in a refugee camp during the Nicaraguan Sandinista-Contra war, Chavarria detailed both the challenges he faced and the milestones he achieved – from being embarrassed for not having shoes in school as a young boy to graduating as a valedictorian at 15 and attending university in Managua on a full scholarship.
He then received scholarships to attend college in Canada and the United States, earned graduate degrees from the University of New Mexico and Harvard University before becoming a naturalized citizen in 2018, he said.
“When I held my U.S. passport for the first time, I felt an enormous sense of pride and I was deeply inspired to give my new country the best of me, my talent, my work and my dreams,” Chavarria said during his testimony, which was focused on the Trump administration’s mass deportation campaign.
“My mother’s high expectations had propelled me to unlikely places, and I had to make a difference in the land that welcomed me,” he said in the Hart Senate Office building in D.C. 
On July 21, Chavarria was returning to Vermont through Texas after visiting his mother in Nicaragua. He was detained and questioned for hours, and federal immigration authorities at the George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston searched his possessions and confidential school district information.
It was a “surreal” and “dehumanizing” experience being separated from his spouse, with multiple federal officials aggressively questioning him in windowless rooms without clocks.
Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt, introduced Winooski Superintendent Wilmer Chavarria at a the Dec. 9 forum in Washington D.C. Screenshot
Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vermont, who introduced Chavarria at the forum, commended the contributions of new Americans and condemned the “indiscriminate roundup of people.”
“Telling your story so that the American people can see that what we’re not talking about is an open border, what we’re not talking about is criminals who all of us want to be protected from,” he said. “We’re talking about hard working people who have families, who have careers, who have aspirations, and who deeply, deeply believe in the American dream.”
The forum included testimony from four other citizens who recounted similar detentions by federal immigration agents this year. 
DHS officials did not respond to comment specifically on Chavarria’s experience or lawsuit. They released an email stating that all travelers entering the United States are treated with “dignity and respect” and are subject to inspections “critical in identifying and combating serious crimes, such as terrorism, smuggling, human trafficking, child pornography, and visa fraud.” 
Chavarria’s testimony and lawsuit comes after the Winooski school district received an onslaught of racist and violent messages for raising the Somali flag after President Donald Trump called the country “garbage.”
The community in Winooski also recently rallied to help a second grade student and his mother, who were detained by immigration authorities during the Thanksgiving break.

Those who love life
Campbell Clarke, 16, Colchester
Life is 
meant to be lived 
fully and completely. 
You need to commit. 
Fully. 
You aren’t meant to dip one toe in from the edge. 
You’re meant to dive in 
with no hesitation, 
no “what ifs.” 
The people who do that 
are the ones who make every day 
thrilling. 
Who care so much 
and with their whole heart, 
care about life and those who live it,
that they are willing to 
risk that whole heart 
to make yours a little lighter. 
These are the people you can count on 
to send you a hug 
wrapped up in little glitters of their love 
anytime you need it. 
You might not even notice 
when they lift the weight, 
but the next time you turn inward to confront it,  
it will be missing. 
These are the people 
who together 
find a way to share their immense love for the world 
with everyone.

Despite the program’s success, the Food Not Cops initiative in Burlington faced pushback in recent months when 100 business leaders drafted a letter claiming the program was having a “negative impact” on the area.

This story by Liberty Darr was first published in the Other Paper on Dec. 11, 2025.
For Rae Beecher, a South Burlington resident of six years, helping provide neighbors with access to food isn’t just a labor of love — it is an act of protest against the hunger war that millions of Americans fight every day.
Last Sunday from 1 p.m. until 2 p.m., for a third snowy week in a row, Beecher and a small group of volunteers were posted up on Market Street just in front of Goose Park with a table chock full of food, sanitary products, canned goods and winter clothes, waiting to greet any passersby with a smile and, should they need it, a hot bowl of soup, too. On the menu this week was a turkey broth vegetable soup with white rice and buttery roasted squash.
“My passion is cooking for people and not getting paid,” Beecher said, letting out a laugh.
The table sports a large “Food Not Bombs” banner, which is a national volunteer-run advocacy group that shares free meals — often vegan and vegetarian — made from reclaimed surplus food to protest war, poverty and environmental destruction.
And while the ethos of the new South Burlington initiative is similar, Beecher, who has organized the group, said it’s following more closely the Burlington-based mutual aid group, Food Not Cops, which has offered free food of all kinds and supplies in downtown Burlington every day for over four years.
“We believe that all food should be used,” Beecher said. “There is an ever-mounting pile of dairy products and meat and stuff that can be eaten.”
Beecher had been volunteering with the Food Not Cops group for three years, but before that had been on the receiving side of the table for a year. After seeing the impact the group was making, Beecher decided to become a part of it.
Part of the draw was the decentralized autonomy that exists with both Food Not Bombs and Food Not Cops, which makes volunteering an easy step to take without many rules or hoops to jump through.
“I myself am disabled, trans, all of these marginalized identities that have made it very difficult for me to be able to go places to volunteer,” Beecher said. “I’ve been all over the United States and it always seems like you have to be part of an organization or you’ve got to be a part of a church or you’ve got to fill out paperwork. But Food Not Bombs has made it so accessible to be able to volunteer.”
For Chamberlin neighborhood resident Ali Gitzes, that’s also part of the reason she has jumped on board after learning about the new initiative.
“I tried a couple of times to join some other Burlington groups, but I never really felt fully comfortable with some of the groups,” Gitzes said. “But here, it’s been very much a, ‘Hey, come and do what you are comfortable doing.’ And that has been fantastic for me.”
But bringing Food Not Bombs to South Burlington is personal for Beecher, who came to the city for one sole reason: safety. South Burlington continually floated to the top of the “best places to live” lists while researching places to relocate. After nearly 50 long hours of travel all those years ago, Beecher and Beecher’s child, Shelby, hopped off a bus in Vermont to begin a new life.
Although Beecher had been volunteering in Burlington for several years, bringing the program to South Burlington really began taking shape as Beecher noticed tents and small encampments popping up across the city.
“Before we moved here, we were homeless for two and a half years, going from shelter to shelter, so I recognized that struggle,” Beecher said. “I’ve been noticing folks sleeping on the ground on sheets on the concrete in my neighborhood. And I’ve got the knowledge, the skill set, all the connections that I needed to get this started in here.”
According to data from Hunger Free America, since the Covid-19 pandemic, an estimated 54 million Americans, including 18 million children, are facing food insecurity. And more locally, a 2022 University of Vermont study showed that two in five people in Vermont had experienced food insecurity in 2021.
Despite the program’s success in feeding the community, the Food Not Cops initiative in Burlington faced public pushback in recent months when 100 business leaders drafted a letter in May, saying the program — and those utilizing the program — was having a “negative impact” on the area and should be moved out of its longtime home at the garage just off the Church Street Marketplace, according to reporting from Seven Days.
Although the South Burlington initiative is much smaller and still in its infancy, similar cries of concern have bled onto the city council table.
Councilor Laurie Smith brought up the topic at the end of a council meeting earlier this month, asking how the city plans to address some resident feedback, more specifically, what he’s heard about South Burlington, “becoming like Burlington” as safety concerns in City Center have mounted in recent months.
“What’s the concern?” City Manager Jessie Baker frankly asked.
“The concern is that we’re going to open up this food service and then we’re going to have this mass influx of unhealthy behavior,” Smith said, emphasizing that these weren’t his words but concerns he’s heard from constituents.
While the volunteer group is technically operating on city land without a permit, Baker said the city is taking a collaborative approach.
“We are taking the approach of, we would like to be in partnership with them and understand who they are and what their goals are and provide any support and partnership we can,” she said. “So that’s how our police chief and our community services sergeant are engaging.”
In the hour that the group was set up last week, at least four South Burlington residents dropped off donations. The overwhelming generosity from neighbors has far outweighed any pushback the group has received, which they noted has been minimal.
“There are a lot more people who want this community to be one that shows love,” volunteer Matt Van Wagner said. “And my feeling is that love begets love, and it drives out fear.”
After all, the initiative isn’t a charity or a service, Beecher said, its simply neighbors doing what they should for each other.
“It’s like a picnic out here, you know, trying to just help the community,” Beecher said. “Solidarity, not charity. We are out here for each other.”

As a children’s entertainer, teacher and troubadour, Gailmor planted his songs like little seeds, one by one, in classrooms, parks, churches and village granges.

This story by Aaron Calvin was first published in News & Citizen on Dec. 11, 2025.
“I’m gonna die with a smile if it kills me,” Jon Gailmor sang on his 1990 song of the same name.
He sang it again in a video he released in April 2020, at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, in the midst of a project in which he posted a video of a performance each day of the lockdown, like bottled musical messages cast into the digital ocean, beginning with an original song about the virus on March 25, 2020, and ending with Steve Winwood’s “Back in the High Life Again” as the vaccines rolled out on May 9, 2021.
As a description for the video where he sang about planning to revel in the pleasures of life so deeply that he would embrace its end satisfied, he appended a note: “My philosophy of life since August 5, 1948.”
He sang his song about leaving this world with nothing left undone for the last time on Nov. 30 and died at 77 with a smile on his face in his son’s New Orleans home following a leukemia diagnosis 18 months prior.
Gailmor was born in Manhattan and spent his early childhood in Philadelphia at the dawn of postwar America. His father had come from a family of Orthodox rabbis, according to Westport reporter Dan Woog, but his father, William, left the synagogue to become a leftist journalist and eventual speechwriter for Henry Wallace, one-time vice president to Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Progressive Party presidential candidate the year Gailmor was born, he told the Burlington Free Press in 1981. He was Wallace’s godson.
The future Vermont music icon graduated from Staples High School in Westford, Connecticut, in 1966, and his early adulthood was shaped by a turbulent world for someone born out of the hope that World War II would be the last war. He remarked to the Free Press that marching in the Poor People’s Campaign to Washington, D.C. in 1968, a protest for economic justice for the poor organized by Martin Luther King, Jr. prior to his assassination but carried out after it, was one of the “most beautiful days of (his) life.”

Despite the core of optimism that would become his hallmark as a professional musician, he grew increasingly pessimistic about the political state of the country as the sixties soured into the seventies. After vagabonding about Europe and releasing a little noticed folk record on British label Polydor with a former high school classmate, he decided trying to cut it in the commercial music industry was not for him. In the late 1970s, he drew closer to Vermont, settling on the shores of Lake Elmore.
“Vermont is what America could be and should be. Vermont is a country, a closely-knit country of its own. In many ways, Vermont feels like the ‘60s. There’s that ‘being a part of something’ and ‘having a say in something’ attitude here,” he said.
Vermont in turn embraced him and allowed his career as a children’s entertainer, teacher and troubadour to flourish. Gailmor planted his songs like little seeds, one by one, in classrooms and in parks and churches and village granges; in “Just Kidding,” the radio show for children on WDEV that ran for 25 years; in his popular songwriting workshops; and his general ability to break out a song wherever he went.
For nearly half a century, Gailmor planted his songs everywhere he went, whether it was a packed crowd in his hometown Elmore United Methodist Church or with the Vermont Symphony Orchestra, which he performed with in the summer of 1993 in a performance that prompted a Free Press writer to dub him “Vermont’s John Denver.”
“The guy could play anywhere, anytime and not miss a beat,” Rusty Dewees, fellow entertainer and Elmore resident, and friend of Gailmor’s, said. “He produced the same high-level output whether it was a dementia ward where everyone is sleeping, or a sold-out show with 10,000 people. You don’t see that with all entertainers. It’s unique.”
Though he wasn’t afraid to play broadly across genres, his workaday approach to songwriting, as something that could be born from anyone as long as it was a true feeling, feels directly descendent from the populist folk music tradition, not stadium pop country. Writer Tom Mckone quoted a friend in his remembrance of Gailmor in The Barre Montpelier Times Argus as calling him the “Pete Seeger of Vermont.” He was well on his way to gaining that status when he opened for Seeger and Arlo Guthrie at Sugarbush in 1978.
In an essay on the songwriting method he passed along to students of all ages published in 2006, Gailmor wrote that, in his misbegotten days trying to make it in the music business, he learned that trying to write a hit left him feeling empty, and that “honest writing unearths threads that connect us all, and that songs that were remembered came “from the gut.”
Despite his endless circuit of performing, teaching and raising his family with his wife, Cathy Murphy — she died in 2022 — Gailmor still devoted time to his role as town moderator, which he held through last year. Armed with Robert’s Rules of Order, he ran Town Meeting Day in Elmore for decades, facilitating the kind of community-centered political life that made him choose Vermont in the first place.
Gailmor would dote on Murphy whenever he got the opportunity, including in a 2022 interview with the News & Citizen about town moderators itching to get back to in-person town meetings. He said one of his favorite photos of his wife was from Town Meeting Day 1980, when she delivered “an eloquent presentation” about the importance of a nuclear arms freeze between the United States and the Soviet Union.
Of course, because this love for Town Meeting Day was a true feeling, Gailmor had to write a song about it. “A Town Meeting Tune,” from his 1994 album “Checking In,” is a paean to the annual enactment of small-scale democracy.
“Creating songs is exhilarating and fulfilling,” Gailmor wrote in 2006. “It also saves me an awful lot of money on therapy. As I age, my pieces become more personal and carry an urgency for me to launch them into the world while I’m still in it.”

	Hunt died five days later. Her death certificate said the foot injury was a “significant” factor. Genesis denied wrongdoing but agreed to pay $3.5 million in a settlement Hunt’s son signed in August 2024.
Yet Genesis hasn’t paid most of that debt, court records show. It may never have to.
Once the nation’s largest nursing home chain, Genesis says it was spending $8 million a month defending and settling lawsuits over resident injuries and deaths in recent years. But the company is now poised to wipe the liability slate clean by seeking refuge in the most protective corner of the legal system for the nursing home industry: bankruptcy court.
The Genesis case, one of 11 large senior care bankruptcies this year, illustrates how health care companies can dodge public and financial accountability for alleged negligence through delays, confidentiality clauses, and bankruptcy maneuvers, a KFF Health News investigation found.
When it filed for bankruptcy in Dallas in July, Genesis estimated its total liability for nearly a thousand settled and pending lawsuits at $259 million. A KFF Health News review of the terms of 155 settlement agreements and corporate financial statements shows Genesis officials knew insolvency was possible yet included provisions in its settlement agreements allowing it to defer payment, often for a year or more.
As a result, Genesis paid nothing in 85 cases and only a portion in the other 70, according to civil court records and bankruptcy claims made available through people with access to them. It still owes $41 million of the $58 million it had agreed to pay in those cases, the records show.
“It just feels like they killed my mom and got away with it,” said Vanessa Betancourt, whose mother, Nellie Betancourt, a retired nurse, fractured her hip at a Genesis home in Albuquerque, New Mexico — an injury the medical examiner’s report said led to her death. Genesis agreed to a $650,000 settlement with Betancourt’s family in April under the condition it would not need to pay the first of seven installments for another year, according to the settlement document.
Nellie Betancourt, shown in a photo with her husband, Gabe, had planned a trip to Las Vegas before she fractured her hip at a Genesis HealthCare rehabilitation center — an injury the medical examiner’s report said led to her death. “When she went into that place, I said, ‘Well, she’s going to be taken care of for a few more days and I’ll take her home,’” Gabe says. (Adria Malcolm for KFF Health News)
Genesis denied wrongdoing in all lawsuits and settlements. In a written statement, the company did not answer questions about individual personal injury cases. The statement said Genesis remained “focused on delivering high-quality, compassionate care to our patients and residents without disruption” during bankruptcy.
One lawsuit Genesis settled for nearly $1 million alleged nursing home managers ignored repeated warnings about a male resident’s behavior before he sexually assaulted a female Alzheimer’s patient, according to court records. In a case the company resolved for $500,000, a Genesis nursing home was accused of delaying the hospitalization of a resident who had vomited brown mucus. He died of a bowel obstruction. Genesis has paid nothing for either settlement, according to bankruptcy claims.
Creditors, including families of the deceased, are expected to salvage a fraction of what they were promised, if anything. On Dec. 10, the company’s owners were scheduled to seek approval by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas to sell its nursing homes and other assets to its largest investor, a private equity firm. In court papers, lawyers for residents and other creditors say the complex plan will prevent them from pursuing Genesis’ new ownership and other companies they blame for the company’s collapse.
John Anthony, a bankruptcy attorney representing 340 personal injury claims against Genesis, said, “They never had any intention to honor these deals.”
Low ratings and fines
During years of financial turmoil, Genesis has frequently struggled to provide top-notch care, federal records show. Using its five-star system, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services rated 58% of homes affiliated with Genesis as below average or much below average. CMS has fined Genesis homes $10 million for violating federal health standards over the past three years.
In 2022, Connecticut health regulators shuttered a Genesis home after two deaths and multiple violations. The company closed another Connecticut nursing home this year after residents twice were evacuated over safety concerns.
In its Chapter 11 filing, Genesis said it cared for about 15,000 residents in 165 nursing homes and 10 assisted living facilities in 18 states. They are centered in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, New Mexico, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Maine, Alabama, Maryland, and North Carolina, according to the bankruptcy filing.

The company said it owed $709 million in secured debt to lenders and the IRS. Under bankruptcy rules, those debts, backed by Genesis collateral, take precedence over the $1.6 billion in unsecured debt Genesis said it owes. Unsecured creditors include a pension fund; contractors that provided health services and equipment; Pennsylvania, New Mexico, and West Virginia for unpaid provider taxes; and former residents and their families who sued.
Dangers in memory care
Sandia Ridge Center, a Genesis home in Albuquerque, was repeatedly faulted by health regulators for not preventing sexual misbehavior in its memory care unit. In November 2021, CMS cited the home for lacking enough nurses to prevent sexual abuse among residents. An inspection report the following August identified more inappropriate sexual contact. Police were called to investigate sexual assault allegations in February and March of 2023, police reports show; neither resulted in criminal charges.
Then in April 2023, a 61-year-old male resident with alcohol-related dementia sexually assaulted a female resident with Alzheimer’s in the dining room, according to a police report and an inspection report. When the resident screamed for him to stop and that he was hurting her, he responded “shut up bitch I know you like this,” according to a lawsuit brought on behalf of the woman, identified in court papers as R.S.
Sandia Ridge management had been aware of the male resident’s behavioral issues for months, according to employee depositions in the case. Police had investigated a prior sexual assault allegation against him the previous year without bringing charges. In one deposition, a former activities assistant testified he hit her and twice pushed her into a bathroom while announcing, “I want to have sex with you.” When she reported him to a senior Genesis manager, she said in the deposition, the manager put his finger over his lips and said, “Shhh.”
The activities worker testified that R.S. used to happily sing along with Elvis Presley songs. After the assault, the worker said, R.S. “don’t sing anymore.”
Inspectors cited the home for failing to protect R.S. The same report said the home didn’t provide a therapist for another female resident who was being sexually harassed. Medicare fined Sandia Ridge Center $91,247. Genesis denied liability but settled R.S.’ lawsuit for $925,000 in May, according to the bankruptcy claim.
“We just felt we have to hold them accountable,” R.S.’ daughter said in an interview, speaking on the condition that she and her mother not be identified, because of the nature of the assault. “Maybe I’m wrong, maybe I’m naive, but the only way to do that is to sue someone, right?”
Genesis has not paid any of the settlement, according to the family’s claim filing.

Growth and debt
Genesis’ downfall can be traced to 2007, when affiliates of two private equity firms acquired the company in a $1.5 billion leveraged buyout, taking on substantial debt, according to its bankruptcy filing. Private equity also has been involved in other health care bankruptcies, including those of the HCR ManorCare nursing home chain, the prison health care contractor Corizon Health, and two for-profit hospital systems, Steward Health Care and Prospect Medical Holdings.
In 2011, Genesis raised $2.4 billion by transferring substantially all its nursing home buildings and other real estate to Welltower, a publicly traded real estate investment trust, according to Genesis’ bankruptcy filing. Genesis then rented the buildings back from Welltower, which made leasing costs a significant expense.
Genesis went on a nationwide buying spree. At its peak in 2016, it had grown to more than 500 nursing homes. In a court declaration, Louis Robichaux IV, a consultant overseeing Genesis’ bankruptcy restructuring, wrote that as the company expanded, it became harder to manage and “mired in corporate inefficiencies.” Robichaux wrote that Genesis’ financial woes were exacerbated by rapidly increasing labor costs and lawsuits, including some predating the covid pandemic.
Starting in 2021, Genesis avoided bankruptcy after receiving $100 million in loans from a private equity firm founded by Joel Landau, the owner of a Brooklyn-based nursing home chain, according to Robichaux’s filing.
But Genesis continued to teeter on the edge of insolvency. In audited financial statements for 2022 and 2023 submitted to a California oversight agency, management and auditors said rent and debt obligations raised “substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern.”
In a court filing, a committee appointed by the U.S. Trustee’s Office to represent the unsecured creditors in the bankruptcy accused Landau and Welltower of orchestrating a covert plan that allowed Welltower to keep getting its rents while Landau could run the company and “siphon value to himself.” The committee alleged their efforts forced the company into insolvency while “staffing levels and patient care declined precipitously.” Landau and Welltower did not respond to requests for comment.
Drawn-out lawsuits
Erin Pearson sued Genesis over the death of her father, James Sanderson, a retired mining company executive who died in 2018 after spending less than a month at Bear Canyon Rehabilitation Center in Albuquerque. In the memory care unit, Sanderson fell repeatedly, suffered medication errors made by nursing home staff, and developed a bowel obstruction and sepsis, according to the lawsuit, filed in 2019. Pearson’s lawyers said he was not hospitalized until eight days after nurses noticed he was vomiting brown mucus.
After the judge rejected Genesis’ request to force Pearson into arbitration, Genesis appealed. It took 2½ years before an appeals court affirmed the original decision to let the case go forward in court, records show.
This past May, more than five years after suing, Pearson reached a $500,000 settlement, with the first payment required by November, according to a copy of the agreement. Nothing was paid, according to the bankruptcy claim.
“It was so drawn out and for so long,” Pearson said in an interview, calling Genesis’ bankruptcy “despicable.”
Payouts postponed
Jennifer Foote, an Albuquerque attorney who represents clients in multiple lawsuits against Genesis, including Pearson’s, said the company frequently filed appeals. “They did not usually win them on these issues,” she said, “and our sense was that they were doing it as a delay tactic.”
Genesis started using installment payments around 2018, said Dusti Harvey, Foote’s law partner. “The payments wouldn’t start for several months out,” Harvey said. Foote said Genesis’ lawyers often wanted to time the payments to start the month the trial in the case was scheduled to occur.
Families had to wait even when comparatively small amounts of money were involved, settlement agreements show. Genesis’ settlement agreements also included a confidentiality clause prohibiting discussion of the incidents.
Genesis agreed to pay $42,000 in a November 2024 settlement, but the first payment was not due until nine months later. It was not paid, according to the bankruptcy claim.
A $250,000 settlement signed in October 2023 did not start paying out until the following September. When Genesis declared bankruptcy — 21 months after the case was resolved — it still owed $100,000, according to the family’s claim.
‘We never found out the truth’
Settling cases allowed Genesis to avoid the expense and publicity of a trial, at which details of how its nursing homes functioned might have been revealed. In October 2020, Margarett Johnson, a retired school bus driver, fell out of her wheelchair at a Genesis nursing home in Waldorf, Maryland, fracturing her jawbone, nose, and neck, according to a lawsuit brought by her family. Johnson was sent to a trauma center and placed on a ventilator. She died three months later, at age 76, from ventilator-associated pneumonia, the lawsuit said.
“It looked like she was hit by a truck,” Angelina Harley, one of her daughters, said in an interview. “I knew my mom was not going to come home. I knew the Lord was not going to punish her more.”
The company denied negligence and blamed the accident on Johnson’s jacket getting tangled in the wheel of her wheelchair, according to the lawsuit. Harley and her sister Angela Swann were dubious.
“We never found out the truth,” Harley said. “They wanted to settle out of court.”
The company denied liability but agreed to a $950,000 settlement in October 2024. It never paid the final $112,500 installment, according to a letter Johnson’s five children sent to the bankruptcy judge.
“If you settle out of court, you know doggone well you did something wrong,” Harley said.
Maddening judges
By summer 2025, judges in some civil cases had run out of patience.
Alma Brown, a retired day care manager and accordion teacher living in a Genesis nursing home in Clovis, New Mexico, suffered falls, infections, bedsores, and other neglect that hastened her death in 2023, according to her estate’s lawsuit. In Santa Fe District Court, Judge Kathleen McGarry Ellenwood castigated Genesis after it failed to pay $2 million of the $3 million settlement to Brown’s estate or explain the delay.
Genesis “obviously benefited by not having to go to trial,” McGarry Ellenwood said in one hearing, according to a court transcript. “They assure me that they’re not trying to renege on their contract, but it certainly seems like they haven’t lived up to what the bargain was.”
Genesis declared bankruptcy the day McGarry Ellenwood announced she would impose more than $100,000 in fines, plus $10,000 more each day until the settlement was paid.
In Pennsylvania, Greg Hunt petitioned a judge to punish Genesis after it stopped payments of the $3.5 million settlement after the death of his mother, Nancy, the resident with the gangrenous foot. She had spent eight months in 2019 at Brandywine Hall, a Genesis facility in West Chester that was later sold and renamed.
In a filing with the Common Pleas Court of Montgomery County, Genesis admitted it was in arrears but asked the judge for more time, citing “unforeseen and exigent financial challenges.” Genesis said care for patients at its nursing homes would suffer if it had to pay immediately.
Unswayed, Judge Richard Haaz in June ordered Genesis to pay up, along with punitive interest. But the bankruptcy court stayed that order. Genesis still owes $1.4 million of the $2 million it was supposed to pay, according to Hunt’s claim. (The rest of the $3.5 million settlement is supposed to be paid by an insurer in January 2026.) Ian Norris, Hunt’s lawyer, declined to comment, citing confidentiality provisions in the settlement.
Court records indicate Genesis lawyers never disclosed in either case that it was preparing to declare bankruptcy.
‘Bankruptcy as a tool’
In the first nine months of 2025, 10 other senior living companies with liabilities over $10 million entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy, according to Gibbins Advisors, a consulting firm.
Hamid Rafatjoo, a bankruptcy lawyer representing nursing homes who is not involved in the Genesis bankruptcy case, said filings may increase as the industry has become costlier to run and class action lawsuits have become a fixture.
“Nursing homes get sued all the time for everything,” Rafatjoo said. “A lot of operators wait too long to use bankruptcy as a tool.”
On Dec. 1, Genesis announced the results of its auction, saying it had elected to sell its assets to a private equity firm controlled by Landau. In a court filing, Anthony, the attorney for the personal injury claimants, alleged the auction was stacked in Landau’s favor despite an “objectively better and higher competing bid” from another private equity investor that would have provided more money to creditors. Genesis said in its statement that Landau’s group had increased its bid during the auction.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and two other senators last month asked the U.S. Trustee’s Office to intervene in the case, out of concern that “individuals who already own or control Genesis are trying to sell it to themselves, wiping away legal and other creditor debts in the process.” Lawyers representing those in charge of the auction did not respond to a request for comment.
Families of former Genesis residents said they fear the capacity to purge lawsuits through bankruptcy emboldens nursing home owners who provide deficient care.
“They can file bankruptcy again,” said Gabe Betancourt, whose wife, Nellie, died after her stay at Uptown Rehabilitation Center in Albuquerque. “And we’re the ones that will pay for it, with our memories, our lives.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-14 10:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,CT doesn’t regulate homeschooling. Many parents want to keep it that way,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/14/ct-doesnt-regulate-homeschooling-many-parents-want-to-keep-it-that-way/,Seeing their kids fall behind during COVID galvanized a new cohort of parents to educate their children themselves. They’re sticking with it.,"It was March of 2022 when Alicia Teitelbaum, a Stamford mother of three, made her decision. 
Her second-grader Britney, who had a speech delay, had spent two years surrounded by people wearing masks. Evelyn, her fourth-grade daughter, was still struggling to catch up after missing many weeks of school in 2020 with exhaustion brought on by Lyme disease.
“I was literally pulling out chunks of my hair,” Evelyn, now 13, recalled. “It was definitely not a healthy environment with me.” 
Teitelbaum said she’d tried to be involved at her children’s school. She was a member of the Parent Teacher Association, worked on a community garden project and developed a food-saving program. But she said she felt the school didn’t want parents’ input. 
Teitelbaum’s youngest daughter was set to start kindergarten the next school year, but a recently-passed state law meant the family would no longer qualify for vaccine exemptions — which Teitelbaum wanted because of concerns about health conditions in the family. 
She decided that, starting the following year, her three daughters would receive their education at home. 
Teitelbaum was part of a wave of parents across the country who moved away from traditional school systems after the pandemic hit. The experience of watching children struggle to sit in front of screens and fall farther behind in their learning galvanized a new cohort of parents to take on the task of educating their children themselves. 
With schools now back to pre-pandemic, in-person, maskless learning, many of those new homeschool parents have decided to stick with it. 
It’s difficult to get solid estimates of the number of homeschoolers in the country — particularly in Connecticut, where parents aren’t required to inform their local district that they’re homeschooling. 
The U.S. Census Bureau’s Household Pulse Survey found that about 5.9% of children in the U.S. were reported as being homeschooled in the 2023-24 school year. The survey also found Connecticut had one of the lowest proportions of homeschoolers that year, at about 3% of the total student population. According to state data from 2023-24, just over 1,800 children were reported as being homeschooled. 
National figures show that the rise in homeschooling was widespread that year. The Institute for Educational Policy at Johns Hopkins University found that 19 of 21 states that reported data on homeschooling showed a higher number of children in homeschool in 2023-24 compared to the prior year. (Connecticut wasn’t among the states included in the study.) 
Connecticut families who are part of the recent wave of new homeschoolers said the benefits quickly became clear. 
They said homeschooling brought their families closer, with siblings learning side-by-side and parents and children spending their days together. It gave children more freedom to explore their own interests and learn at their own pace. Parents of children with learning disabilities say by teaching them at home, they’re more able to provide the attention and services their children need — which they often don’t receive in school.
Many parents believed they’d found the answer. But then, more questions came.

Earlier this year, homeschooling came under scrutiny from state lawmakers after multiple high-profile cases of child abuse made national news. In May, the public learned of a Waterbury man who was allegedly held captive for two decades after being withdrawn from public school. 
The state Office of the Child Advocate released a report that found withdrawals of children from public schools had been used to hide abuse. Of 774 children who were withdrawn to be homeschooled between 2021 and 2024, about a quarter were in families where there had been at least one report of abuse or neglect that the Department of Children and Families judged to merit more attention. (The state doesn’t keep equivalent data on the families of children who attend public schools.)
Alongside the report, Acting Child Advocate Christina Ghio drafted recommendations that the state require homeschool parents to inform their local school districts each year that they’re homeschooling, and that their children receive an annual academic evaluation. She also recommended that local school districts review the records of any family seeking to withdraw a child for homeschooling, to see whether there are any past reports of abuse and neglect. 
Ghio said the recommendations were based on two goals: to make sure homeschooled children are being educated and to keep them “healthy and safe.” 
“ We acknowledge there are a lot of parents that are doing homeschooling and doing a wonderful job, and this is not an allocation of blame on those parents,” she said. “The reality, though, is we currently have a system where we know that some children are being removed from school for the stated purpose of homeschooling to hide abuse and neglect. And that’s not acceptable.” 
The assurances have done little to calm the fears of parents like Teitelbaum. 
Many homeschooling parents — who have devoted resources, time and money to giving their children what they feel is the best education possible — say they feel they’re being blamed for the state’s shortcomings. They point to failures by the state Department of Children and Families to monitor families who were reported for neglect and abuse before they pulled their children from the public schools — families like that of 11-year-old Jacqueline “Mimi” Torres-García, who was abused and died in 2024 and whose mother allegedly claimed the child was being homeschooled in another state. 
Rather than regulating homeschooling, parents like Teitelbaum say they want the state to audit DCF and address problems in its operations.
“I don’t understand why the legislative body is protecting DCF as a government agency instead of saying, ‘We have major failures going on, let’s fix them,’” Teitelbaum said.
DCF spokesperson Peter Yazbak said in a statement that the agency is “committed to being as transparent as possible and welcome further dialogue and feedback from families, legislators, advocates and community partners to enhance our case practice and best protect children.”
Parents and advocates also frequently mention the challenges faced by the public schools — chronic absenteeism, for example, or the number of students in public schools who aren’t reading or doing math at grade level. They say the state should be focusing on what’s already under its control.
“Fix your house that’s broken rather than trying to regulate what we’re doing,” Teitelbaum said.

The Evergreen Co-op Social Club
One might assume all homeschool arrangements look similar: a group of siblings scribbling in workbooks around a dining room table. But these days the educational experience is more varied, and more communal. 
Take, for example, the co-op — a collective of parents who teach classes to their own children and other children in the group. Three years ago, Teitelbaum founded her own co-op along with nine other families in Stamford. 
With the blessing of her pastor at the Church of Christ in Stamford, they transformed the building into the home of the Evergreen Co-op Social Club, which meets on Mondays and Thursdays and offers a mix of classes that they switch up every 10 weeks. Most of the co-op parents spent the other three days of the week covering more academic subjects like math and language arts at home.
On an October morning inside the church, children as young as toddlers all the way through high school were scattered in classrooms, or sitting outside in the sunshine for their classes. No space was left unused. Jackets, bookbags and shoes lined the hallway from the main worship space to classroom and fellowship areas. 
Downstairs, a parish social space filled with tables and chairs served as a cafeteria during lunchtime and a space for art and cooking classes during the day. Amy Irish, a mom of two, was downstairs checking on the earrings that her students had fashioned out of clay, part of a jewelry-making class she teaches. 
The classes range from three to 12 students who are roughly the same age. All are taught by parents, who offer instruction in subjects aligned with their expertise or interests. Irish, a former yoga teacher, also teaches a section on hula-hooping. John Questel, a father of three who worked as an electrician in the U.S. Navy, said he sometimes teaches an introductory class on circuits. 
Like the other parents, Irish and Questel said it was the pandemic that pushed them to homeschool. Irish, who at the time had a second-grader and a toddler, said it was impossible to get her second-grader to sit in front of a screen while responding to her toddler’s demands for attention. 
“Remote hybrid learning was so terrible,” Questel said. Even before that, his son Steven didn’t like school. The boy had trouble reading, and while the public school gave him extra help, as soon as he’d get caught up, all the extra help would disappear, Questel said. And his son would fall behind once again.

Homeschooling was his wife’s idea, and initially he wasn’t thrilled, Questel said. He’d grown up in public school, and his perception of homeschoolers was that they were antisocial and didn’t have the necessary skills to succeed in life. But discovering the existence of co-ops, coupled with the fact that his wife had a master’s degree in education, convinced him to give it a shot. 
Several of the homeschool parents have backgrounds in education. Brittany Velazquez, who drives to the co-op from her home just over the state line in New York, was a former teacher and assistant principal in the New York City Public Schools. Her oldest son, Amari, was only a baby when COVID began, but her experiences working in the school system during the pandemic made her realize that she wanted to take charge of her son’s education herself. 
“ I can give him a more well-rounded education because I know what he’s into,” she explained. “One-to-one learning would be the ideal situation for anybody. So I kind of just took it and then ran with it at that time.” 
Some of the parents who send their children to Evergreen have exceptional skills they teach the children. For instance, Teitelbaum said one of their parents who worked on Broadway has taught a music class. At picnic tables outside the church, a parent who works at the Greenwich Country Day School was teaching carpentry, demonstrating how to use a drill and explaining different drill bits. In a “Model UN” class — in which students pick a country to represent and learn about the United Nations — one of the guest speakers was a mother who’d worked as a translator during the Kosovo War.  
Angela Watson, a professor at Johns Hopkins University and the director of the university’s Homeschool Research Lab, said the availability of groups like co-ops, along with a vast array of online resources and materials, should alleviate concerns that parents might not have enough education themselves in order to teach their children. Several of the parents said they also have tutors who work with their children on days they aren’t at the co-op. 
Erin Reeves, a former hairstylist, said she’s taught a few courses on the subject, including a color and styling class that ended with the kids having their hair dyed. Reeves said she initially said no to teaching at the co-op. “ The idea of teaching other kids was overwhelming to me,” Reeves said. “I was like, I feel like I’m barely teaching mine.” 
That has changed. This semester, Reeves and a group of 11-year-olds are reading “Bridge to Terabithia,” a short novel about two friends who create an imaginary kingdom. The kids are creating costumes and props for their own “kingdom” — an undersea one. 
Teitelbaum’s daughter Britney was dressed in a mermaid costume, wearing a crown she made from construction paper and carrying a trident made out of aluminum foil. At the end of the class, they’d perform a play.

Reeves discovered the co-op through Teitelbaum after she’d decided to pull her daughters from school during the pandemic. Her oldest, Violet, who was in second grade when the pandemic hit, has dyslexia and ADHD, which made online schooling nearly impossible for her. 
“I couldn’t even unload my dishwasher,” Reeves said. “They both just needed help constantly.” 
Violet, who is now 13, said she remembers struggling in elementary school and that she was bullied because of her dyslexia. She said her parents had to bribe her with money and candy to get her to go to school. 
Reeves said she was nervous at first about the idea of homeschooling a child with a reading disability. She did a lot of research on her own and hired a tutor specializing in dyslexia. Then they discovered the co-op, which she said both her daughters loved. 
In some ways the co-op feels like a series of after-school clubs and activities, designed to bring students together and expand their interests and knowledge. 
The co-op breaks down what parents say is one of the major misconceptions about homeschooling: that the children are isolated and have no social life.
In addition to participating in co-ops, homeschool students often enroll in sports. Some of the students participate in Barefoot University, a weekly group that offers activities focused on nature and the outdoors. Teitelbaum’s daughters are part of a writing group that meets online with a former writing teacher who offers coaching. Questel’s 15-year-old son Steven is enrolled in online college courses. 
“ My kids are so social, and they just have so many interesting experiences all around,” said Irish. 
Teitelbaum repeatedly refers to the co-op as having the “village mentality.” It’s a place where the families know one another and are invested in one another’s lives, she said. 
“They’re all my kids,” she said.

What’s best for kids
Homeschool organizations have a history of success — in many states — in pressuring lawmakers to recognize homeschooling as a legitimate form of education, and then to loosen restrictions on it. 
In the book “Homeschool: An American History,” Milton Gaither wrote that state lawmakers who try to strengthen regulations on homeschooling almost always fail “due to massive outcry from homeschoolers.” Gaither even cited an example from Connecticut, when, in 2002, a state representative proposed legislation requiring local superintendents to approve homeschoolers’ curriculum and mandating that parents who homeschool have at least a high school diploma. Over 1,000 people showed up in opposition to the bill, which never saw the light of day. 
Something similar happened this year. In May, as lawmakers conducted a hearing on the child advocate’s report and recommendations, thousands of homeschool families crowded into the Legislative Office Building in Hartford to protest the possibility of new regulations. They stayed on for several days, many of them with children in tow, displaying signs throughout the building’s lobby and atrium. 
Ultimately, lawmakers decided not to raise any new legislation establishing new requirements for homeschoolers.  
Unlike some of its neighboring states, Connecticut doesn’t require homeschoolers to submit an instructional plan or submit the results of a yearly academic test. It’s one of 12 states that doesn’t even require homeschoolers to notify local districts that they plan to homeschool. 
Ghio, Connecticut’s acting child advocate, said her recommendations for homeschooling were meant to strike a balance between parents’ rights to teach and care for their children as they deem fit and children’s rights to be educated and well-cared for. 
Watson, at Johns Hopkins, said she believes that for a state like Connecticut, with no regulations around homeschooling, to add in stringent requirements would be extremely difficult. Instead, she suggested the state use incentives for homeschoolers to participate more in the wider public school community — like offering free testing or free curriculum, or allowing homeschoolers to participate in sports and extracurriculars in their local school districts. 
“Connecticut is one of the only states in the country that doesn’t provide for any access at all for homeschooled children to their local public schools,” Watson said. 
Fran Rabinowitz, executive director of the Connecticut Association for Public School Superintendents, said allowing that kind of participation in public school activities could be complicated, raising questions about insurance and how to handle situations in which a child gets hurt or refuses to follow rules. 
And Ghio said the incentives Watson suggested wouldn’t resolve the problem of parents who withdraw children from school in order to isolate them from society.

Coral Karrass, a mother of three who serves as treasurer of the Connecticut Homeschool Network, one of the largest homeschool organizations in the state, said she felt recent conversations at the Capitol were creating a picture of homeschooling families as “secretive abusers.” 
“ It’s hurtful. It’s so hurtful,” she said. 
She said she often speaks with parents who tell her about the difficulties they’d had with their local public school. She said while public schools are necessary, they aren’t the ideal place for all students. 
“We care about kids,” she said. “I think that everyone should want to see what is best for every child, no matter what that might be, no matter what that looks like.” 
Karrass was homeschooling before the pandemic. She and her sister taught their combined five children together. They switched back-and-forth between their two homes, carrying a bag that contained notes from whoever had taught the previous day. 
She and her sister both needed to work — they work gig jobs making deliveries — and the arrangement allowed them to educate their kids while earning money. 
Her niece and daughter were close in age, as were her nephew and her son, meaning they could do similar assignments. Karrass said she established a tiered system, where each child would do assignments on a similar theme, but at their own level. 
She described it as resembling a one-room schoolhouse. The older children care for the younger ones, she said, and it’s a better example of the kind of relationships they would encounter as adults. 
“I think when you go out into the real world, even in college … you’re mixed with a wider variety of people,” Karrass said. “It’s more like a realistic community than I think what a public or private school setting gives.” 
Karrass hadn’t expected to homeschool. Her oldest daughter, Abbi, was a January baby, and she barely missed the cutoff date to enroll in kindergarten. The little girl seemed ready to start learning, so Karrass decided she’d try teaching her for a year. By the end of that year, Abbi was reading at an advanced level. 
Rather than put her in a classroom where she would be far ahead of her peers, Karrass said, she decided to continue homeschooling her. When Karrass’s sister saw what she was doing, she wanted to join in. 
Through an online chat group, Karrass connected with Diane Connors, president and co-founder of CHN, who she said helped guide her through the homeschool process. She said the organization provides parents with critical support in everything from finding curriculum to establishing a routine. 
Karrass also developed a list of free and inexpensive resources for parents who don’t have a lot of money to spend on homeschooling. “Money should not be an obstacle,” Karrass said. “If you have access to the internet, ignorance is a choice.” 
Research from Johns Hopkins shows that parents of gifted students, like Karrass, often turn to homeschooling when the local school district can’t meet their needs. 
The same is true of children with special needs. Watson said that “upwards of 20% to 30%” of homeschoolers fit that description. 
That was the case for Kathryn, a single mother of two boys who pulled her younger son out to homeschool during the 2021-22 school year. Kathryn asked that only her middle name be used because her older son is still receiving special education services through their local school district, and she’s concerned about repercussions. 
Kathryn’s sons are both on the autism spectrum, she said, and getting special education services for her older son was a “full legal battle.” He was being restrained and secluded on a near-weekly basis — so much that he developed claustrophobia. Eventually, her local district placed him in a specialized school outside the district. 
Her younger son’s challenges started in first grade. She said she couldn’t get his school to provide him with a special education plan, called an IEP, and he was being bullied. By Christmas of that year, Kathryn said, he was trying to figure out how to avoid going to school.
But it wasn’t long before the pandemic hit, and Kathryn began working from home more. That allowed her the time to homeschool her younger son. 
She now works a hybrid schedule. On the days she’s home, she gives her son assignments he can do independently. The teaching continues year-round, including on evenings and weekends. On the days Kathryn goes to the office, a nanny stays with her son, who is now 10 years old. He’s also part of a co-op, and plays adaptive sports. 
Kathryn said she’s concerned with the idea of additional regulations for homeschoolers. The idea of being forced to check in with the school district annually makes no sense, she said. “They already failed my child once. Why would they step in again?”

Tradeoffs and priorities
Parents who choose to homeschool don’t do so lightly. It requires a great deal of time and engagement, Watson said. But they say the rewards — family time, a flexible way of learning — outweigh whatever sacrifices they’ve made.
“ I don’t homeschool because I think traditional public or private school education is bad,” said Trisha Kozloski, who directs the Catholic Schoolhouse Co-op in Middletown. “I do it because these children were given to me as wonderful gifts from God, and I want to be with them as much as I can. And we have a big family, and so I want us to know each other and love each other and build relationships and strong bonds.” 
Parents emphasized the benefits of spending time together as a family, the flexibility of allowing children to learn at their own pace, and the absence of stigma for children with disabilities. They say their children can sleep in; that they can finish their schoolwork in a few hours, leaving time for fun excursions, and that they no longer have to rush through the mornings. For children who are deeply involved in outside activities, like dance, it allows them to focus on their passions without the pressure of a traditional schedule. 
That doesn’t mean it comes without challenges. With the need for one parent to be present at home, choosing to homeschool sometimes means moving to a single income, forcing the family to be more frugal.
“ Of course I would love a bigger house,” Kozloski said. “ You make these choices. And my kids are also just fine with not having these things. They don’t get everything they want. They wear hand-me-down clothes. And they’re perfectly fine children. They’re probably better for that, too.” 
For some parents, it also means making the hard decision to give up a career they’ve worked toward. 
“I think as a female it is very hard to say you spent five years working at a degree for something, and then say, well, my priorities have shifted,” said Teitelbaum, who worked as a physical therapist before deciding to homeschool full-time. 
Velazquez, who had worked in the New York City public schools, said the decision was also difficult for her at first. “ I was really sad for a long time. At one point, I kind of felt like it was a defeat,” she said. “And then one day it really just clicked that … you have all of this value to give your most prized possession, which is your child.”  
Kozloski said she was disturbed by the idea that a child was being abused by parents who lied and said they were homeschooling. But she said that those bad actions didn’t negate her good ones. “ I have nothing to hide, but that doesn’t mean you should make me prove myself. I’m doing what I’m supposed to be doing,” she said. 
Kozloski said she’s worried that additional regulations would take away from the time she has to spend teaching her kids.
“ My main focus is educating these kids and doing that to the best of my ability. I don’t want to be burdened by recordkeeping,” said Kozloski. 
And Karrass expressed concern that the public schools, which have graduated children who were unable to read, would be responsible for determining what was or wasn’t “adequate” for homeschoolers — potentially holding them to a different standard. 
Watson, of Johns Hopkins, said evidence shows that homeschooled children often do well on tests and attend college. And while her research showed that homeschooling families value academic achievement, they place less value on having their children attend prestigious universities. Parents who spoke to the Connecticut Mirror also placed a great deal of value on practical, everyday knowledge. 
Karrass said it was more important to her that her children have a solid foundation rather than be pushed ahead to advanced classes. A student might be able to figure out a calculus equation but can’t add simple money, a task they would need to do every day, she said. 
“Academics are great. Of course, everyone wants their kids to be straight-A students and get lots of scholarship money for college and get all the AP credits and stuff,” Kozloski said. “But I want my kids to be kind, contributing members of society in whatever way fits for them.” 
Similarly, Teitelbaum said her priorities aren’t about having her children work at a Fortune 500 company or go to an Ivy League university. 
“I want them to be happy. I want them to be great people,” she said.

Two homeschoolers, two stories
In the homeschool community, advocates refer regularly to a specific passage in Connecticut state law known as Section 10-184 — “Duties of Parents.” 
It’s a law that requires parents to teach their children basic subjects, including history, mathematics, reading and writing, either by sending them to a public school or proving they are getting “equivalent instruction” somewhere else. Homeschool advocates present this law as proof that the state places the education and care of children first and foremost in the hands of the adults who raise them. 
In this lies one of the biggest challenges in proposing homeschool regulations: the vast diversity in how parents teach their children and the wide spectrum of experiences that former homeschoolers say have influenced their lives, for better or worse. 
Some young adults say homeschooling was the best education they could have imagined. 
“I couldn’t have asked for a better education, for a better childhood,” said 21-year-old Annaliese Harper, a former homeschooler, during a forum in August in Torrington. 
The youngest of five, Harper — whose mother is Donna Person, vice president of the Education Association of Christian Homeschoolers in Connecticut — was homeschooled from an early age all the way through high school. Most days, she said, she would finish her work by 1 or 2 p.m. and have free time for other activities. She was involved in dance, drama, took piano lessons and showed Alpacas and goats while in 4-H.

Up until high school, Harper was part of a once-a-week co-op through Classical Conversations, a Christian homeschool education program that has chapters across the country and internationally. Harper said homeschoolers would be grouped by age and study traditional subjects like math, science, history, English and Latin. The program was primarily discussion-based, with parents acting as “tutors” to help students learn. 
Harper said she never felt she was missing out on anything by not attending a traditional school. 
“I was thankful I didn’t have to wake up at, I don’t know, 7 a.m. and go to school and I didn’t have to be in a classroom all day. I could go outside a lot and be with my family, be with my siblings,” she said. 
Her experience was different from that of 24-year-old Beau Triba, who was also homeschooled throughout his life. Triba spoke at a forum on homeschooling in May, where he said his parents were part of an evangelical Christian community that had to approve all the textbooks he used and controlled myriad aspects of his life — from what he wore to whom he could be friends with. He said he did not receive instruction and taught himself by reading the textbooks his mother gave him.
“I think that my mom did the best that she could. I want to say that with my full heart,” Triba told CT Mirror. “She did not have the resources she needed to educate three young children.” 
Triba, who is queer and transgender, said he struggled with anxiety and depression from a young age, made worse by the isolation he felt. He also said he felt judged by the community he was raised in. 
Triba said in May that he did not feel that the education he received was equal to a public school education, that it contained inaccurate information, and that it did not prepare him for adulthood. 
“I have never felt more alone than I did while being homeschooled. I did not feel supported,” Triba said. 
Triba also participated in Classical Conversations, although he didn’t start the program until high school. He didn’t have a strong foundation in basic subjects, he said, and he struggled to understand the lessons. Rather than receiving additional help, Triba left a lot of the work undone, and he said his transcript falsely indicated he’d completed coursework he hadn’t. 
Harper said she was able to take college-level classes in English and chemistry at the age of 16. She said that, because of her education, the English class was a review for her. She said she was well-prepared for the college environment — able to advocate for herself and interact with professors.
She is now a senior at Eastern Connecticut State University, studying social work. After graduating, she plans to enroll in a masters program. She got married in May, and she said she hopes to start her own family — and plans to homeschool her children. Her experiences with social work, she said, have shown her the challenges inherent in keeping children safe in a child-welfare system that she described as “overrun.” 
“I see how hard public school teachers work, how hard social workers work, but the truth is no teacher, no social worker — [no one] can know your child as well as you do and can give the most focus as a parent can,” she said. 
In contrast, Triba said he struggled through two semesters of community college. He didn’t know how to read a syllabus, how to manage his time, or who to go to for help. He attempted suicide and ended up in a hospital and then in various intensive therapeutic programs. Eventually, he took a course through Hartford HealthCare to become a recovery support specialist, a job he said he enjoys.  
Triba said he supports the idea of having homeschoolers regularly check in with officials — not as a punitive measure, but as a way to offer help to homeschooling families like his. 
“I think there were so many resources that could have been offered that just weren’t, because nobody knew we were struggling,” Triba told CT Mirror. 
In particular, Triba said, it would have been helpful to have support from social services after his first suicide attempt at age 16. He said he was not hospitalized and received no professional counseling in the aftermath. 
Through the Coalition for Responsible Home Education, a nationwide nonprofit that advocates for legislation regulating homeschooling, Triba met other homeschoolers who also had negative experiences.
He said it’s sometimes hard to talk about his own history, because he doesn’t want to interfere with those homeschoolers who are going above or beyond. He said any regulations should be made in collaboration with the whole community and should emphasize offering resources rather than investigating wrongdoing. 
“I think there’s a middle ground here that we can find,” he said. “And we have to — I think we have to find this middle ground.” 

Rep. Tammy Nuccio, R-Tolland, speaks at a forum on Monday night at the Tolland Senior Center. The forum, attended by five Republican lawmakers, was presented as an opportunity for homeschool advocates, parents and children to speak about their concerns around possible state regulation of homeschooling.

A call for ‘genuine conversation’ on policy 
Not all parents who homeschool are against the recommendations Ghio raised. 
Steve Kennedy, a Newtown resident who homeschools his four children, said he supports proposals like annual check-ins and academic assessments for homeschoolers. 
Kennedy said he decided to homeschool because he wanted to give his children a more in-depth curriculum than he felt they would receive in the public schools, particularly in the area of history. He said although he reads the state standards and has given his oldest daughter standardized assessments to make sure she’s on track, he would “welcome some feedback” from the state or local districts.  
“I think the whole idea of parental rights, it kind of blanks out the child’s [rights] entirely,” said Kennedy. “It’s framed as … ‘Oh, this is the government coming in and telling you what to do,’ when really it’s like, ‘The government is making sure that children’s rights are maintained.’”  
Kennedy said he didn’t believe the state was trying to force homeschoolers to enroll their children in public schools, and he said he didn’t see the policies as “particularly burdensome or intrusive.” 
Rabinowitz, of the superintendents association, said she envisioned a state-run and state-funded office for homeschoolers, rather than expecting them to report to their local school districts. The office would oversee regulations, she said, but also provide support for homeschooling families.
“I personally know some homeschoolers, and I’ve heard some wonderful things about homeschooling, and I think we can learn from them as well,” Rabinowitz said. “My outlook isn’t one of anything negative about homeschooling other than we need to account for all our children.” 
State Rep. Patrick Biggins, D-Manchester, who served as the chair of a legislative working group on homeschooling, said conversations with constituents and research into best practices for regulating homeschooling were ongoing.
“I think that the goal is to balance parents’ rights with the state’s vested interest in making sure children are safe, and making sure children are getting an education,” Biggins said, adding that he doesn’t believe the current law emphasizes those values strongly enough.
“Conversations are still preliminary,” State Rep. Jennifer Leeper, D-Fairfield, the chair of the Education Committee, said in a text message. 
State Rep. Lezlye Zupkus, R-Prospect, the highest ranking Republican on the legislature’s Education Committee, said she also wasn’t aware of any proposed bill. She said that while she felt it was critical to protect children’s safety, she did not support singling out homeschoolers. Any changes lawmakers make, she said, should consider challenges in the public schools as well. 
Chemay Morales-James, who has homeschooled her children for about a decade, said she understands the desire that public school and state officials have to try to keep children safe, even as she doubts that the regulations being proposed will help children who find themselves in the most dangerous situations.   
Morales-James, a former teacher, now runs a homeschool collective called My Reflection Matters. The majority of families in it are people of color who often came to homeschooling after dealing with specific challenges in the public schools. Morales-James said families in her collective often distrust the public school system because of its historic failure to serve communities of color. 
She said her oldest son, who is Black, spent just three days in pre-K before she decided to pull him out. He was acting out, and she worried how teachers would perceive him as he got older.
She said she knew families whose children had been placed in special education in response to what she characterized as “overactive energy.” And she said the schools sometimes failed to address what she described as “racial incidents” that would happen between students or between a student and a teacher. She also said families felt their culture and history weren’t always portrayed correctly in public school curricula. 
“Racism is a health crisis to many of our families,” she said, referring to the collective. “It affects people mentally and emotionally and they don’t believe that schools take that seriously enough … so they just choose to opt out.” 
Morales-James homeschools her two boys, now ages 14 and 12, through a philosophy called “unschooling” — allowing their interests to guide what they study and learn. She said it removes a lot of the pressure that comes from a traditional education system. 
She said that as a former teacher, she’d watched how students who didn’t learn according to a school system’s expectations would be “labeled” and feel as though they weren’t as smart as other children. She said that homeschooling allowed her own boys to learn free from the comparison with other children. 
That’s one of the reasons she’s concerned about the idea of regulations around homeschooling.
“Are you going to say I’m abusive because my 8-year-old didn’t reach your standard?” she said. “It’s such a tricky, fine thing because the whole reason we’re opting out is because many of us don’t believe in those standards. So then to hold us up against them, it’s like, well then, where’s our freedom?”  
Morales-James said if Connecticut wants to implement regulations that would actually protect children, she believes there would need to be more dialogue between the public schools and the homeschooling community. She said she’s tired of the polarization that has thwarted sincere discussion. 
“I think the options they’re giving out now — they won’t work because they have not come out of real, genuine conversations between these two groups. And until those conversations and real working happens in relationship with each other, we’re going to keep producing or promoting policy that is not going to work for either.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025_1113_SR_Homeschool_353-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-14 05:56:15.721665

While it’s not actually mandatory to offer as a benefit, it’s at the top of the list for many employees and job seekers—making it feel mandatory for nonprofits that are looking to attract and retain quality employees. However, for many Connecticut business owners, the ever-rising costs associated with traditional group health plans make offering health insurance to employees feel almost impossible, and certainly outside of the budget.
Today, Connecticut business owners have another option. An option that can help you manage employee health benefits more efficiently and find quality, affordable health coverage with the BusinessPlus platform. BusinessPlus simplifies the process of managing health benefits and provides access to additional coverage options like Individual Coverage Health Reimbursement Arrangements (ICHRA), making it easier to find and offer flexible coverage that won’t stretch your budget.
The BusinessPlus platform, together with ICHRA, gives Connecticut businesses an opportunity to affordably provide quality health coverage to their employees. Some Connecticut business owners have received quotes that outline double-digit savings if they were to switch from their traditional group health plan to an ICHRA.* With the cost of traditional group health plans today, double-digit savings can be a significant increase to your bottom line.
The benefits of offering an ICHRA don’t stop at the savings though. ICHRA also provides employees with more flexibility and choice compared to traditional group plans. With an ICHRA, employees have the opportunity to purchase their own individual health plans, rather than being forced into a one-size-fits-all group plan. With an ICHRA there are 22 individual plan options for employees to choose from that range in coverage and cost, ensuring there is a plan that can meet the unique needs of employees and their families.
And sure, having the ability to choose from 22 plan options is an excellent benefit, but to some it might feel overwhelming or create a paralysis of choice. At Access Health CT, we understand this may be a concern. To help anyone who may feel overwhelmed by the process, Connecticut-certified brokers are eagerly waiting to support your transition to an ICHRA, answer your questions, or help whenever you may need it at any point in the process. So, between the ease and simplicity of managing employee health benefits that are baked into the BusinessPlus platform, and the support from Connecticut-certified brokers, the entire process from start to finish is designed to be as easy as we could make it for Connecticut business owners.
While employees get to choose their own individual health plans, the cost and budget for reimbursement are left up to the business owners. This helps ensure that offering an ICHRA is always within your budget.
Together, the BusinessPlus platform and ICHRA provide Connecticut business owners with an alternative to the rising costs of traditional group health plans, while giving employees the freedom to choose a plan that best suits them and their health needs.

(White House)If you were appalled by the spectacle of Donald Trump clumsily accepting a peace trophy that looks like a prop from “Night of the Living Dead,” then brace yourself.
There may be worse in store.
To recount, Trump was given — to nobody’s surprise — the inaugural “FIFA Peace Prize” during the World Cup final draw at the Kennedy Center in Washington. You may recall that Trump named himself chair and master of ceremonies at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, which for 50 years had been the nation’s premier cultural institution and largely insulated from politics. Now, it’s simply another reflection of Trump’s MAGA whims, and an oddly political choice for the final draw.
I don’t follow soccer — sorry, I mean football — but I gather from those who do that the final draw is an important day for fans, because that’s when they know which teams will play at various host cities.
Next year’s World Cup — which has been touted as the equivalent of 104 Super Bowls — is expected to be the biggest sporting event on the planet. The games will be held at 16 locations in the United States, Mexico, and Canada — including Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri.
The first game at Arrowhead will be Argentina (the 2022 Cup champion) versus Algeria on June 16.
But any news about the matchups was overshadowed by Trump’s clutching of the prize (or rather, the medal that came with) from FIFA president Gianni Infantino. FIFA is the global governing body for the sport and it has a history of bad behavior. The 2022 Cup was embroiled in bribery claims and concern about human rights violations in the host country, Qatar. In 2015, following an FBI investigation, top FIFA officials were indicted for racketeering and money laundering. You can think of Infantino giving Trump the prize as akin to the world’s most historically corrupt sports body giving a trophy to one of the world’s most corrupt leaders.
Trump, smarting from not having received the Nobel Peace Prize he so lusted after, accepted the FIFA prize but couldn’t resist taking a swipe at the Biden administration.
“The United States one year ago was not doing too well,” he said.
The prize, according to FIFA, is given “to reward individuals who have taken exceptional and extraordinary actions for peace and by doing so have united people across the world.”
FIFA did not reveal whether there were other nominees for the award or why the prize was announced just a month before. Apparently, the extrajudicial killings of alleged drug traffickers in small boats, the demonization and mass deportation of migrants at home, or threatening to invade Venezuela were not disqualifying factors.
The trophy, reputedly made of real gold, matched the absurdity of the award itself. It is a dread object, with zombie-like hands clawing upward, as if from the grave, at a globe that resembles a meatball you left in the microwave too long. But at least it was on brand. His mooning over the FIFA prize reminded me of the 2017 photo of Trump with his hands on a glowing orb in Saudi Arabia. No James Bond movie villain could signal his desire for world domination any clearer.
Why on this or any other Earth would FIFA indulge Trump?
To keep him happy.
Trump, a dangerous combination of ego and avarice, is about the only person who could seriously disrupt the World Cup games. Of the three host countries, the United States has the most locations, 11, and Trump has demonstrated his willingness to send troops to American cities for any reason. Also, most of the 6.5 million fans expected to attend this summer’s games are from places that Trump may have taken a dislike to, including Africa and South America. At least one national team — Haiti — is from a place Trump has described as a “s***hole” country.
Travel bans could seriously disrupt the ability of fans to attend games, and without fans there is no fan money. While claims that the World Cup is equivalent to 104 Super Bowls are likely overblown, there is no denying that a staggering amount of money is at stake. Tickets for the 2026 games are the most expensive in the World Cup’s history. Admission for the best matches range into the thousands of dollars and “dynamic pricing” — a first for FIFA — will set prices for some games according to demand.
The six games to be played at Arrowhead, including one quarter-final game, are expected to attract 650,000 visitors to the region. To support that tourism, the state of Missouri is giving $74 million, and Kansas is chipping in $28 million.
Infantino, once a Trump critic, now considers the MAGA leader a friend. FIFA’s ethics committee has been asked to investigate whether Infantino violated the organization’s neutrality rules in giving Trump the peace prize. From a business standpoint, it might seem like a bauble to keep him happy.
But why would Trump accept such a prize when it is so obviously absurd?
He must know that, coming on the heels of his Nobel disappointment, it appears to be some kind of poor substitute. There has been sport over this at Trump’s expense, but the joke is probably on us.
We’ve been here before.
Or at least the world has.
When the 1934 World Cup was hosted by Italy, dictator Benito Mussolini seized the opportunity to turn sport into propaganda.
Consider the official poster, the work of illustrator Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, an early adherent of Italian Fascism and the author of the “Futurist Manifesto.” It presaged a new movement that would glorify war; scorn women; and worship technology, destruction and speed. His World Cup poster is bold and unsettling, a dynamic male figure in an Italian national team shirt poised to kick the living daylights out of a brown ball, a fasces tucked into one corner.
“Mussolini was no great soccer fan, but he recognized the sport’s power both in terms of projecting an image of strength and in bringing the country together,” writes Jonathan Wilson in his 2025 book, “The Power and the Glory: The History of the World Cup.”
From its inception, Wilson writes, soccer has always been about far more than soccer. FIFA was organized in 1904, but the first World Cup wasn’t held until 1930, in Uruguay. In 1934, the cup was still new enough that much of the football world, including England, simply decided to sit the games out. But for Mussolini, the World Cup was a way to project fascist strength. He made himself central to the games, famously paying for his own tickets and watching from the stands as Italy kicked the daylights out of the United States.
Mussolini also created a trophy — the “Coppa del Duce” — as an additional prize to be given to the winner.
Sculpted in bronze, the trophy depicted players in front of the fasces — the axe and bundle that was the symbol of ancient Rome, co-opted by the fascists. It was also six times the size of the Jules Rimet, the original World Cup trophy named for FIFA’s longest-serving president. That trophy depicted the Greek goddess Victory and was used from 1930 to 1970. The current trophy, in use since 1974, is a somewhat abstract representation of two athletes exulting in victory.
I prefer the look of the old trophy, but alas it was stolen in 1983. All that’s ever been found is the stone base.
Now, I understand that Trump is no Mussolini.
But he is Il Duce-like in his awareness of image, and by placing himself center stage at the World Cup, he is reaching a vast global audience where football is played with a white ball and you can’t touch it with your hands. Typically, when the word “vast” is used it’s mostly hype, but in this case no other description comes close. FIFA is projecting that 6 billion people will watch at least one of the games, up about a billion from the last World Cup.
That is 75% of the world’s population.
How many people in the world know who won the Nobel Peace Prize?
If you know it was María Corina Machado of Venezuela, pat yourself on the back. You’re part of the informed minority. Machado, who was awarded the prize for her peaceful efforts to overthrow Nicolás Maduro’s dictatorship, has dedicated the prize to Trump and now supports the use of force for regime change.
Hear that? I’m doing a forehead slap.
The world has become as dangerous as it was in 1934, if not more so. Let’s see, there was something else I was going to mention about dictators and sports. Oh yes, it was this: two years after Mussolini muscled his way to the forefront of the World Cup, another leader — Adolf Hitler — used the Olympics in Berlin to show the world the strength of the Nazi regime. But Jesse Owens taught the Führer a thing or two about the myth of the master race.
Save your cards and letters. I’m not saying Trump is Mussolini or Hitler.
But the tune sounds familiar.
Just about everyone with a screen of any kind — a computer, a smartphone, or communal access to a television — is expected to watch come summer. If they’re not plugged in individually, they’ll be gathered in schools or pubs, experiencing perhaps the national thrill of victory or the cold embrace of defeat, but at some point they are bound to have seen an image of Trump clutching that damned trophy, and for some the image will stick.
A man of peace.
Never mind the dozens of blown-to-bits occupants of the small boats in the Caribbean and the murder of the two survivors of the first strike, on Sept. 2. Never mind that just days after receiving the dread object, he seized an oil tanker off the Venezuelan coast as part of a massive military buildup that appears ready to topple the Maduro regime.
For my part, I will avoid as much of the World Cup nonsense as possible. If it’s on a television I have control of, I’ll change the channel. If it pops up on my feed, I’ll swipe past. No ads for World Cup merch will sway me. The “peace prize” alone was enough to persuade me not to spend a single dollar on anything related to FIFA or the World Cup. Well, I did buy Wilson’s book, but that taught me how politics have always been deeply embedded in the history of soccer.
Meanwhile, I’ll watch how plans for the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles are shaping up. Politico reports that nearly all of the new board members to the Olympic planning committee have MAGA ties.
I hope Haiti wins the Cup.

Not a fare hike (for once), but a complete rewiring of how train tickets will work, courtesy of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. All this comes under the guise of a “better customer experience.”



Let’s get one thing straight before the panic sets in: Connecticut is not raising rail fares in January. That’s just in New York, so if you only consume NYC-media’s recent coverage of this story you are understandably confused.
However… another 5% hike that the Connecticut Department of Transportation approved for the our trains will hit in July 2026. Just classic Connecticut: slow, steady, predictable fiscal pain: higher fares, worsening service.
Why the need for fare hikes at all? In part, because of fare evasion. 
The New York City Citizens Budget Commission estimates the MTA loses $1 billion a year because of that problem, $46 million on Metro-North and the Long Island Railraod alone. And on NYC buses (soon to be made “free” under Mayor-elect Mamdani?), 45% of riders already just jump aboard without paying.
So, in part, the fare hikes are like that “public benefits” surcharge on your electric bill:  the rest of us pick up the tab for uncollectable bills.
January’s big changes affecting us? The new MTA ticketing rules which absolutely do apply to Connecticut riders because we share the system, just with different fare hike schedules.
One way tickets will self-destruct at 4 a.m.

One of the new Metro-North Railroad ticket machines., Credit: MTA

Buy a ticket today, use it by 4 a.m. tomorrow, or it evaporates. “Poof!” The MTA markets this as “flexibility.” Commuters might call it “gotcha, but make it digital.” Late for the train because you couldn’t activate your ticket in a cellphone dead-zone? Or “forget” to activate that e-ticket before the conductor comes around? That’ll cost you a $2 onboard surcharge, a fee whose primary purpose appears to be reminding you who’s in charge.
Roundtrip tickets… GONE!
They’re being replaced by the new “Day Pass,” valid until 4 a.m. the next morning and good for unlimited travel that day. Great for joy-riding and easier for conductors to scan. But more convenient for riders? Well, maybe.
Ten-trip tickets… also gone.
In their place comes a “mobile pay-as-you-go reward:” buy 10 trips within 14 days and the 11th is free. It’s the kind of loyalty program only a government agency could invent: stick around long enough, pay full price consistently, and eventually you’ll get something resembling a perk. Even Dunkin’ has a better frequent customer program.
And again, all of these rule changes apply equally to riders from Connecticut and New York because the MTA controls the fare products (with CDOT’s blessing) even on Connecticut-run service. And all this applies to Metro-North, Shore Line East and Hartford Line trains.
What Connecticut riders are getting in January is a system that’s more complex, less forgiving, and seems designed with the breezy assumption that Metro-North passengers have the time and mental bandwidth to memorize expiring tickets, activation rules, and mobile-only discounts.
So enjoy this moment of clarity. Your ticket rules are changing in January, but your ticket prices are not… at least not yet. In today’s commuter world, maybe that almost qualifies as a holiday stocking-stuffer.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Metro-North-new-tix-machine-1024x805.jpg,,,2025-12-14 04:56:21.002950

Fighting to reverse these moves in Washington should be a top priority, but we surely can’t count on that happening.","MASSACHUSETTS HAS EXPERIENCED a full assault on the basic pillars of our innovation economy. Clean energy programs and infrastructure, biomedical research funding, immigration, and core funding and academic freedom at our state’s leading universities have all landed in the crosshairs of the Trump administration’s reckless cuts and ideologically extreme policy agenda.  
While President Trump wraps this all in America First rhetoric, these moves will severely undermine our country’s ability to compete economically and remain a global leader in cutting-edge research and development. Given the outsized role these areas play here, the threat to Massachusetts is particularly acute.  
The Commonwealth needs to act boldly and creatively to respond to the threats to its innovation economy. Fighting to reverse these moves in Washington should be a top priority, but we surely can’t count on that happening. We may not be able, on our own, to mitigate the full impact of these harmful policies, but we can take action at the state level to counter their effects.  
Over the summer, Gov. Healey unveiled a proposal to do just that. The Discovery, Research and Innovation for a Vibrant Economy, or DRIVE, Initiative includes a call for $400 million in state appropriations to help make up for some of the lost federal funding.  
Committing public dollars to help bolster or jumpstart economic activity is not something that should be done lightly without due diligence and careful consideration. But in weighing the governor’s proposal, legislative leaders don’t have to look back too far for an example of unquestionable success with such a strategy.  
It may be hard to remember, but Massachusetts wasn’t always the leading state for the innovation economy. In 2003, despite our state’s deep strengths in finance, health care, and higher education, the major economic story of the day was Boston losing Fortune 500 headquarters. 
The Commonwealth had invested heavily in remaking Boston’s downtown and waterfront, but 20 years ago the Seaport was best known for inexpensive parking lots. The state’s economy had crashed in 2001, and it was only slowly regaining the jobs lost during the recession. In 2004, the Boston Foundation bemoaned the fact that greater Boston “lacked the collaborative gene,” which was essential to competing in the global knowledge economy. There was significant pessimism disguised as realism – which all made sense if you were a fan of the Boston Red Sox during the many decades leading to October of that momentous year. 
As seen in the sudden reversal that year of our baseball fortunes, however, the world changes – sometimes quicker than you expect. I served in the Patrick administration during both of the governor’s terms, eventually as the state’s first assistant secretary for innovation policy in the Executive Office of Housing and Economic Development, and witnessed this firsthand.  
Working under Secretary Dan O’Connell and the late Secretary Greg Bialecki, both of whom helmed the housing and economic development secretariat under Gov. Patrick, I had a chance to see and participate in initiatives that had a catalytic effect on the state’s innovation economy. 
In 2008, Gov. Patrick and the Legislature partnered to launch the state’s 10-year, $1 billion Life Sciences Initiative, which served as a catalyst for regional partnerships and international investment.   
The scale of the initiative drew international attention and investment in Massachusetts, while the vast majority of the state funds invested (over 70 percent of funds through FY 2014) were spent on research and development infrastructure and educational programs throughout the state. A 2018 impact study showed that Massachusetts outperformed peer states in life sciences wage and job growth from 2009 through 2016, providing evidence that the initiative did make a meaningful difference in improving the state’s competitiveness.   
In 2009, the state provided seed funding for MassChallenge, one of the world’s largest startup accelerators and competitions. Anyone who attended a MassChallenge event can readily attest that it had a dynamic effect – as if a world-class region was meeting itself for the first time. MassChallenge reinforced the state’s international reputation for innovation while also supporting the state’s entrepreneurial ecosystem by inviting winners from regional startup accelerators to join its program. 
In 2012, the state’s five largest research universities partnered to open the Massachusetts Green High Performance Computing Center – a major research facility – in Holyoke. It was the first significant collaboration to ever take place among these universities – and there, too, a seed investment by the state was critical to its success. Through the computing center, the partner universities have sponsored collaborative research by faculty across their schools and with external partners, with the goal to make our state more competitive for major federal research funding opportunities. 
Unquestionably, the Commonwealth is right to focus on a triad of long-term challenges that threaten our economic health and competitiveness: affordable housing, education and workforce development, and safe and efficient transportation. Progress in those areas creates a more livable state for all of us and unlocks bottlenecks to hiring and growth. But it won’t be enough to forestall the worst impacts of current federal policy. 
The actions of the federal government strike at the very heart of our state’s competitive advantage. Massachusetts is a magnet for the world’s talent, from undergraduate students to postdocs to regional headquarters for major multinational corporations. We thrive on collaboration and the sophistication of our experienced researchers, investors, executives, advanced manufacturers, and technicians.   
Collaboration is at the heart of our success. And collaboration requires trust, mutually agreed upon goals, resources, and sufficient stability over time to execute on plans. It requires belief, hope, and expectation that hard work will lead to accomplishment, whether that is in six months, a year or five years. The state investments described above succeeded in part because they were sustained commitments that improved capacity and created a reliable state partner that enabled the private sector and universities to make long-term plans and investments of their own.    
That’s why it is imperative that our state’s leaders – from government, education, and industry – partner and respond robustly to this threat.  
The House and Senate, with whatever modifications they deem appropriate, should move quickly to pass the DRIVE Act, which is designed to stabilize and grow our state’s research and innovation ecosystem. Roughly half of the funds would be devoted to backfilling some of the support for our universities, investing in promising research proposals that went through rigorous scientific review prior to the federal cuts.  
The second half of the funds would support new collaborative research and initiatives that can accelerate our innovation economy. For new initiatives, the Commonwealth should require substantial direct and in-kind matches to magnify the impact of state dollars. In addition, the state should be ambitious in choosing initiatives that bring together multiple partners and advance national research priorities that have been defunded or opposed by the Trump administration. 
We are, eventually, going to come out of this unsettling era. How we do so is up to us. In a moment in which fear and uncertainty abound, we should set the goal for Massachusetts to emerge as the strongest, most competitive innovation state in the nation in 2029.

Omaha Mayor John Ewing Jr. has said he would like to see more public-private partnerships related to public spaces in the city. (Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — The fate of one of Omaha’s oldest public parks brought roughly 50 people Saturday to a meeting that included impassioned remarks from community and civic leaders, a Nebraska lawmaker and a City Council member.
At issue is a proposed arrangement that would place the operation of North Omaha’s Miller Park in the hands of a private philanthropic foundation, the Lozier Foundation. 
Some have questioned the setup, though city officials hosting the meeting reaffirmed that the 80-acre park would remain open to the public and owned by the city. Maintenance and programming would be paid for and managed by Lozier under a “Miller Park Trust” contract yet to be presented to the City Council.
Saturday’s meeting at Nelson Mandela Elementary School, across the street from Miller Park, was intended to gain community input. Mandela school is a nonprofit entity funded by a donor group led by the Lozier Foundation. 
Miller Park’s development dates back to the 1890s.
Omaha mayor sees public benefit to putting city park in hands of private foundation

Several community members voiced concern that the proposal was moving too quickly and sought assurance that North Omahans would not get short-shrifted.
Anthony Karefa Rogers-Wright recognized the work and improvements Lozier has made in the area and said his skepticism and search for more transparency is rooted in past “malfeasance” of city government and “how it’s spending the people’s money.”
Nancy Williams of No More Empty Pots has been a neighborhood resident for three decades. Her kids attended school in the area and she said she’s seen the park transform for the better as the Lozier Foundation has invested millions into improving trails, the fountain, the pavilion and sponsoring concerts and programming.
“The issue is fear and trust,” of being let down by other sources and officials in the past, she said. “People have not felt seen and heard.” 
Terri Sanders, owner and publisher of the Omaha Star newspaper, which focuses on the Black community, suggested it was time to trust those leading the effort.
“North Omaha suffers for lack of pulling the trigger,” she said. “Pull the trigger and let it fly.”
Omaha officials leading the meeting, including aides to Mayor John Ewing Jr. Jacqueline Morrison and Thomas Warren, distributed a “myth vs. fact” sheet and said the Ewing-backed arrangement with the foundation will help improve public spaces when a city budget is ill-equipped to do so.
Warren said a study of the city’s more than 250 parks revealed a “woefully underfunded” Parks and Recreation Department that needed $5 million to bring it up to par. He said the agreement with Lozier Foundation would free up city resources for other parks and services.
Lozier Foundation representatives also were present and outlined the organization’s investments in the past decade at Miller Park, including a splash pad, soccer wall and pavilion renovation.
Among the city’s points:

If approved, Lozier would pay an estimated $800,000 annually to operate and maintain the park starting in mid-2026. The contract still has to be voted on by the City Council. City officials said they hoped that a three-step process could begin before the year’s end. 
The proposal is for 10 years, however the city retains the ability to end the agreement at any time.

Nancy Gaarder, president of the Miller Park Minne Lusa Neighborhood Association, said the park was a “mess” before the foundation invested.
“Lozier did the city’s job,” said Gaarder, and referred to notable performing artists the foundation brought to the park that she said helped build community relationships.

Upkeep is critical for environmental and health measures, she said, citing stagnant water and possibly toxic algae of the fountain prior to improvements. Gaarder advocated for the trust arrangement. 
State Sen. Ashley Spivey of North Omaha said she will continue to monitor the situation that affects her legislative district. “Sounds like people want this but want the right parameters.”
LaVonya Goodwin, who represents the neighborhood on the City Council, said the attention people are paying to the matter shows they care about the community she said has suffered from decades of neglect. 
She said public-private partnerships work but that she’ll continue to listen to constituents as the contract terms develop.
“We want people to know their voices matter, their concerns matter and long term … that this park is a place the community can be proud of,” Goodwin said.

A manhunt continued early evening, (Google images)PROVIDENCE — Two people have died and several others were wounded in a mass shooting in a Brown University engineering building late Saturday afternoon, prompting a shelter in place alert on the Ivy League campus and a massive search for a gunman that continued into the evening.
Providence Mayor Brett Smiley confirmed at a press conference that began shortly after 6:30 p.m. that at least two people were killed with “a minimum of eight” more injured and in critical condition “but stable at Rhode Island Hospital.” 
Smiley could not disclose whether the victims were Brown students.
“These numbers may change,” Smiley said. “We are still in early hours.” 
The shooting in the Barus and Holley building on Brook Street occurred as final exams were taking place between 2 and 5 p.m. inside Barus & Holley Engineering, Provost Francis J. Doyle III said.
Providence Police Cmdr. Tim O’Hara described the suspect as a man who was wearing black. The suspect left the engineering building’s Hope Street side. O’Hara said that police did not know what type of gun was used.
Forensic and witness evidence were being used to identify the suspect, and the police were primarily relying on video evidence at the moment, O’Hara said. 
“All I can give you is a male, all dressed in black, right now,” O’Hara said of the suspect.
The suspect walked away from the area, and law enforcement were unsure where he had gone as of 6:50 p.m. 
Smiley said the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are also involved in the investigation.
Gov. Dan McKee spoke at the Saturday evening press briefing. “So, the unthinkable has happened,” McKee said. 
Providence Fire Chief Derek Silva said the fire department was first alerted about the shooting at 4:05 p.m. 
Brown sent out its first emergency alert at 4:22 p.m., noting “an active shooter near Barus & Holley Engineering.” The alert cautioned the campus community to lock doors, silence phones and “stay hidden until further notice.” The alert also advised the options of run, hide, or, “FIGHT, as a last resort.”
An update at 4:51 p.m. noted a suspect was in custody, only to be redacted in a 5:11 p.m. update that read, “Police do not have a suspect in custody and continue to search for suspect(s).” The post also advised students to continue to shelter in place. 
Smiley said at the press conference that the individual in the 4:51 p.m. update had been mistakenly connected to the incident.  
At 5:27 p.m., another emergency alert reported shots fired near Governor Street. That update was also reversed at 6:10 p.m., which added that “a secondary shooting incident near Governor Street is unfounded.” 
The erroneous update from 4:51 p.m. noting a suspect was in custody made its way to President Donald Trump, who wrote on his TruthSocial site at 5:44 p.m. that he had been briefed on the shooting and that the Federal Bureau of Investigation was “on the scene.”
“The suspect is in custody,” Trump wrote. “God bless the victims and the families of the victims!”
At 6:03 p.m., Trump posted again: “The Brown University Police reversed their previous statement — The suspect is NOT in custody.”
“We are very sorry to share that we have confirmed reports of multiple shooting victims, but we are not able to share their condition,” the University wrote in a statement issued at 6:05 p.m. “They have been transported to local hospitals.”
The Brown emergency updates page first confirmed that there were “multiple shooting victims” at 6:05 p.m. The university could not share their conditions at the time, but noted they were “transported to local hospitals.”
Rescues and other apparatus from surrounding municipalities responded to the campus, including Bristol, Barrington, Central Falls, Cranston, Cumberland, Coventry, East Greenwich, North Kingstown, Scituate, Smithfield, Warwick and Woonsocket.
At 6:17 p.m., a call cleared rescues to return to their home communities.
“Sadly, today is a day that the city of Providence, the state of Rhode Island, prayed would never come,” Smiley said. “We’ve heard about horrific acts of gun violence and active shooter situations in other places, but not here.”
Smiley, who lives in the area, told reporters he was at home watching the Providence College Friars when he saw police lights fill the surrounding neighborhood.
This story will be updated.

(Krisanapong Detraphiphat/Getty Images)The battle over who should oversee Georgia’s Medicaid program could be coming to an end, and the decision could have a major impact on Georgia families in need.
The fighting started last year after the state awarded contracts to four companies: CareSource, which previously held a contract with the state, and newcomers Molina Health Care, UnitedHealthcare and Humana. Two companies that had been contracting with the state previously, Peach State Health Plan and Amerigroup, lost their bids.
Georgia’s Medicaid program covers about 2.2 million people in the state at a price of $16 billion, according to KFF data.
The Georgia Department of Administrative Services heard arguments Thursday from Peach State and Amerigroup, who say the selection process was unfair, and the winners who remain pleased with the way things went. It comes after the department denied protests against the decisions last month.
James Washburn from law firm Nelson Mullins, arguing on behalf of Amerigroup Georgia, said the department erred, pointing to documents from Georgia Division of Family and Children Services Director and Department of Human Services Commissioner Candice Broce that he said show an effort to lobby government officials against Amerigroup as “part of an effort to shift blame from her agency to Amerigroup for performance issues.”
“The fact that Commissioner Broce expressly asked the DCH Commissioner to deny AmeriGroup a contract is the best kind of bias evidence you can find,” Washburn said at Thursday’s hearing.
Amerigroup and Peach State also argued that there were irregularities in the scoring process and that United does not meet requirements for statewide coverage, particularly when it comes to psychiatric care and treatments used by people with autism.
Attorneys representing the winning bidders argued that the protests were meritless.
“Amerigroup and Peach State bombed the test,” said attorney Alex Hontos with law firm Dorsey and Whitney, arguing for United. “They finished fifth and eighth, and when they bombed the test, instead of taking that on board and coming back and doing better the next time, studying harder, what did they do? They attacked the teacher. They attacked the test. They say that there was bias. They say that there was something wrong with the process. That’s what you’re looking at here.”
The debate means more than just dollars for the millions of people who receive care through Georgia’s Medicaid program, and that includes more than 11,000 kids in foster care who receive care primarily through Medicaid.
Ahead of Thursday’s hearing, a group of foster parents and advocates held a rally outside the state Capitol to call on the department to reject the plan to swap providers.
John DeGarmo, a foster parent and advocate for foster children, speaks at a rally outside the Georgia Capitol. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
John DeGarmo, founder of an advocacy group called the Foster Care Institute and a foster parent to more than 60 kids in Georgia, said the plan would move foster kids from Amerigroup to United, which could mean children potentially losing access to care if they do not live near providers who accept United.
DeGarmo and others said they are especially worried about foster children with autism after ProPublica released a report that found the company has a policy to cut costs by denying effective and necessary treatments for children with autism.
DeGarmo said it’s unfair to force foster children already dealing with trauma to risk losing access to medical professionals, and he worries requiring foster parents to jump through more hoops to take care of children in need will make it less likely that people begin or continue fostering.
“An inability for children to receive health care locally will exacerbate foster parent burnout faster than anything I could think of,” he said. “And that’s what foster parents are talking about right now, burnout and compassion fatigue.”

City officials said an earlier failure of a 10-inch water line installed in 1901 undermined a 42-inch, 55-year-old transmission main that burst with explosive force late Friday night on Thomaston Avenue by Waterville Park, launching pavement into the air and shattering windows.
With damage still being assessed and no firm timetable for restoration, the break prompted a massive response by city and state agencies, including the National Guard and state Division of Emergency Management and Homeland Security. School was canceled for Monday in Waterbury, and the city’s restaurants were ordered closed.
Fire hydrants were nonfunctional, and in the few areas where the taps had limited pressure, the water was not safe to drink without out boiling. Using plans developed during the COVID-19 pandemic, the state and city prepared to distribute water at two locations no later than Sunday.
“The Guard is here. We’re going to have water distribution, potable water, big racks of it, a little like what we had in Rentschler Field during COVID,” Gov. Ned Lamont said in a midday briefing with Mayor Paul K. Pernerewski Jr. at Waterbury’s public works headquarters.
The consequences of the failure are unprecedented, amplified by the city’s belated program to upgrade infrastructure after decades of neglect. A second high-pressure main that could have provided nearly uninterrupted service was off line, being reinforced with a thick plastic liner.
“We had planned on pressure-testing that on Monday, chlorinating it, and samples were going to go out next week to clear it to be put back in use,” said Brad Malay, the city’s water superintendent.
The rupture occurred on one of the two high-pressure lines that feed the system from a city-owned water treatment plant miles away in Thomaston. 
“The 1970 main was actually fine, but when the 1901 main failed, it washed out the other main. They reside across the road from each other,” Malay said. “And due to the age the fragility of those pipes, it doesn’t take a lot for those pipes to, you know, let go.”
Water from the plant to the main was cut off, but water still flowed from the break more than 12 hours after the rupture as the system emptied. Valves that could have localized the impact were fragile and could not be closed, officials said.
“The biggest problem that we have that causes the most trouble, frankly, are the valves, because you could isolate breaks and leaks along the way that would have the most minimal impact,” Pernerewski said. “The problem we have is that we get to a lot of these valves, and we go to tighten them and shut them, they don’t work. We can’t get them closed, and so we have to spread the bigger and bigger areas that get affected by it. And that’s part of the problem that we’re having here.”
Malay said new valves are now tested every six months at his order, by “exercising” them, essentially closing and opening them, but the older ones are not. The risk is greater than the reward, he said.
“Once a valve reaches a certain point, nobody wants to touch it, because you don’t want to break it by exercising it, and then be the guy who’s now caused the problem,” he said. “So everybody leaves it alone until the guy who needs to close it. And it’s been 25 years since anybody touched it.”
Waterbury, a city that fell into insolvency and state oversight a quarter century ago, is in the midst of a $30 million program to strengthen a water system built to meet the needs of a once-thriving brass industry and the dense neighborhoods that housed its workers.
“The problem is that even if you had enough money to do it all at once, you cannot simply replace the entire system at once, because you’d have to shut it down. So you have to do it in discrete parts,” Pernerewski said.
The city is doing what it can, he said. This time, a major break came at the worst time, when the backup was under repair.
“We just unluckily got caught this year with a couple bad breaks on our transmission needs,” Malay said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/waterbury_water-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-13 17:56:45.326774

Dan McKeon of Amherst. Oct. 24, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska lawmakers are recommending State Sen. Dan McKeon of Amherst be expelled from the Legislature following allegations that he groped a staffer after a sine die party earlier this year. 
The Nebraska Legislature’s Executive Board, its group of 10 senators in charge of handling disciplinary procedures within the Legislature, voted unanimously Saturday to recommend McKeon’s expulsion, save for State Sen. Teresa Ibach of Sumner, who was unable to attend due to the winter weather. She confirmed to the Examiner that she also would have voted yes on the motion based on the Legislature’s existing policy.

Expulsion is the strongest disciplinary measure the board can recommend, but it requires a full vote of the Legislature to pass. This means the matter will come before lawmakers during the 60-day legislative session that begins in January. 
The recommendation stems from allegations by a legislative staffer attending an end-of-session party earlier this year. The Nebraska State Patrol received a report in September that McKeon had allegedly “made inappropriate contact with her buttocks with his hand, over the top of her clothing,” according to Patrol spokesman Cody Thomas.
The Examiner is aware of the alleged victim’s name but is not publishing it because it is the policy of States Newsroom and the Examiner not to identify people who say they have been abused unless they wish to talk publicly.
The Patrol cited McKeon for misdemeanor public indecency. The Lancaster County Attorney recently downgraded the allegation to a misdemeanor charge of disturbing the peace. McKeon’s arraignment on the separate criminal charge is set forWednesday. 
In a statement from Executive Board Chair State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair on behalf of the committee, the board concluded the expulsion recommendation was necessary “in light of a demonstrated pattern of behavior by Senator McKeon and not in response to a single isolated incident.”
“Board members emphasized that the action was taken to protect the integrity of the Nebraska Legislature and to uphold the standards expected of its members,” Hansen’s statement reads.
McKeon is a registered Republican who was elected to the officially nonpartisan Legislature in 2024, replacing former State Sen. Fred Meyer of St. Paul. McKeon’s biographical page on the Legislature’s website highlights that he has been married for 30 years and has four children.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Gov. Jim Pillen and other state officials have called for McKeon’s resignation, but McKeon has said he will not resign. Pillen stood by his statement when asked Saturday. 
McKeon’s attorney Perry Pirsch has said McKeon “is guilty of nothing but a bad pun and pat on the back.” He said McKeon has cooperated with the Executive Board’s requests so far, and would continue to do so for “reasonable requests.”

“The Legislature should be careful not to allow unadjudicated, contested allegations drive them to drastic decisions,” Pirsch previously said by email. “They are setting a dangerous precedent if they assume the worst and take actions based on nothing but contested allegations.”
Pirsch did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the Executive Board’s Saturday vote. 
The Executive Board had met at least twice previously to discuss the situation, according to Hansen. The group’s second meeting on the matter, Dec. 8, adjourned without reaching a resolution because Hansen wanted the full board to weigh in on the decision. 
During the board’s first meeting on McKeon Oct. 27, Hansen said the group agreed to move McKeon’s former first-floor office, exchanging it with another first-floor office previously occupied by State Sen. Tanya Storer of Whitman. Hansen did not specify why the board did so.

The Snohomish Regional Fire and Rescue water rescue technician was here near Monroe, saving people, as closed roads became ponds. Down the road, a Dodge Grand Caravan was still partially submerged Saturday morning. The agency rescued over three dozen people in total, said Battalion Chief Jamal Beckham. Statewide, at least 250 have been rescued.

On Saturday morning, local, state and federal elected officials, including Gov. Bob Ferguson, U.S. Sens. Maria Cantwell and Patty Murray and U.S. Reps. Suzan DelBene and Kim Schrier, surveyed the aftermath. 
The flooding, while still historic, mercifully didn’t quite reach the extreme levels initially predicted. No deaths or significant injuries have been reported, Ferguson said. 
“This event came very close to being much more catastrophic, very close, and this reality should serve as a warning and opportunity to strengthen our preparedness and resilience for the next event,” Snohomish Regional Fire and Rescue Chief Brian Park told the elected leaders at Station 31 in Monroe. 
Snohomish County officials had called in state water rescue teams to help, but sent them up north to Skagit and Whatcom counties because of how well local fire departments were managing along the U.S. 2 corridor. 
Many of the nearby farmers chose to stay, building dikes around their livestock, Huber explained. 
“They’ve seen it this level, I think maybe not themselves, but their grandpa probably worked through that one,” he said. 
Many animals, though, ended up at the nearby Evergreen Fairgrounds. At its height, the equestrian park there housed 171 horses, 140 chickens, 104 cattle, 94 goats, three rabbits and two turkeys, said Mike Ohlsen, the fair manager.
Water was still receding Saturday after record flooding hit Snohomish and Skagit counties. A sunny Saturday serves as respite before the rain returns on Sunday.
Reid Wolcott, the warning coordination meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Seattle, said 4 to 7 inches of rain could be in store for parts of the Cascades, which could fuel more river flooding. Strong winds, with gusts up to 45 to 50 mph, could also sweep into the region over the next day or two, he said, posing a risk of toppled trees and power lines.

“We’re not out of the woods,” Wolcott said. “We’re halfway through.”
By mid-week, temperatures are forecast to fall, and snow levels will drop to lower elevations, reducing the amount of water flowing into rivers.
After touring around Monroe, Ferguson and others headed up to Mount Vernon, where officials were relieved the waters didn’t breach a floodwall protecting the city’s downtown. 
Thousands of people remain under evacuation orders, mostly in Skagit County. State officials said Friday it could be days or weeks before evacuees can return to their homes. A long stretch of U.S. 2 between Skykomish and Leavenworth remains closed.
Some relief from the federal government has arrived in Washington, said Ferguson. 
President Donald Trump on Friday signed an emergency declaration to give the state federal aid to respond to the flooding. Federal personnel are working with local authorities on rescuing stranded people, clearing debris from roads and other emergent needs, the governor said.

Assessing the damage to get further federal aid for the recovery will come later. Unlocking that additional support, including assistance for individuals, will require the feds to approve a disaster declaration. 
“We’re looking at millions of dollars of infrastructure damage,” said Snohomish County Emergency Management Director Lucia Schmit. “These are small towns, small cities, diking districts that don’t have the funding. This is a catastrophic financial burden for them.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/US-2-debris-slide-December-2025-floods.jpg,,,2025-12-13 17:56:45.326774
