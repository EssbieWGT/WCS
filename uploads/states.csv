The two candidates are locked into a tight race, vying to replace former Republican U.S. Rep. Mark Green, who resigned from the seat in July. 
Johnson and other speakers — including President Donald Trump, who Johnson called mid-rally — not only promoted Van Epps but also heavily criticized Behn. 
“You’ve got a radical on the ballot, we can’t hardly believe it,” said Johnson. “I thought Tennessee was deep red — how did it happen?”
“This is not a game: this is a dangerous far leftist, and (Behn) will be a rubber stamp for (U.S. House Minority Leader) Hakeem Jeffries and (U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez) and all the radicals in Congress,” he said.

Trump called Van Epps “fantastic.”
“He’s for everything that we represent,” said Trump, before saying Behn is getting “a lot of publicity cause she’s got a little something weird and television is doing whatever it can.”
While campaigning in Clarksville, Behn countered the Republican attacks by saying the Republican Party has no plans for lowering cost of living.
District 7 is a Republican stronghold which Trump won by 22% in the 2024 presidential election. The GOP has held the seat since 1982, through several redistricting cycles. 
But the race has become a priority for both parties since Democrats swept the Nov. 4 elections in other states, including New Jersey and Virginia — both of which elected Democratic governors — and in New York City, where Zohran Mandami won the mayoral election. 
Democrats across the nation drew hope from the November results and gave Republicans, who hold a three-seat majority in the U.S. House, anxiety about winning in Tennessee. A recent Emerson College/The Hill poll showed the race has narrowed to a 2% margin between the two candidates heading into Election Day.
Behn was elected to the legislature in a 2023 special election to replace the late Rep. Bill Beck. She beat three other candidates — including fellow state Reps. Vincent Dixie and Bo Mitchell  — to win the Democratic nomination. During her House tenure, she has twice proposed bills that would eliminate Tennessee’s grocery tax. 
GOP rally draws every prominent state Republican
Other speakers at the Van Epps rally included U.S. Sens. Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty, U.S. Reps. Tim Burchett, Andy Ogles and John Rose, as well as several candidates who lost to Van Epps in the Oct. 2 Republican primary. 
One of those, Rep. Jody Barrett, the Dickson Republican who finished second in the primary, said it was the first Van Epps event he attended. 
About 300 people attended the event, held at the home of Willis Johnson, a billionaire and Republican donor, who is also the grandfather of state Rep. Jake McCalmon, a Franklin Republican. 
In making what is one of his final pitches to GOP voters, Van Epps said he plans to win decisively.

“We have the right solutions, the right plan to address affordability to drive down costs, to work on health care, childcare, housing and energy,” he said. “That’s what the president stands for, that’s what the speaker (Johnson) stands for.”
“The alternative is unacceptable,” said Van Epps. 
Mike Sholar of Franklin, who said he attended the rally because Van Epps shares similar values, referenced Mandami in speaking to the Lookout. 
“I am scared to death that what happened in New York will happen in my backyard,” he said.

Donations lean towards Behn, dark money spending split
Since the primary, Behn has out-fundraised Van Epps, posting just over $1 million in donations raised between the Oct. 15 pre-primary financial disclosure with the Federal Election Commission and the Nov. 12 filing. For the same period, Van Epps reported raising $590,000. 
Money from independent groups has poured into both sides, with about $7 million being spent as of Nov. 25. 
Johnson is only one of the national politicians who have weighed into the race: Trump endorsed Van Epps in the primary and has held two tele-rallies for him, with another scheduled for Monday night. 
Former Vice-President Kamala Harris urged Democrats to vote during a visit to Nashville in November, and former Vice-President Al Gore, a Tennessean, will join U.S. Reps. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez of New York and Pramila Jayapal of Washington in a Monday tele-rally. 
Hagerty told the Lookout that despite the district’s regular Republican voting record, he takes nothing for granted.
“This is a special election, typically low turnout. That means they’re vulnerable to being gamed and we could get a result that doesn’t reflect the district.”

This story was originally reported by Ebony JJ Curry of The 19th.  Meet Ebony and read more of their reporting on gender, politics and policy.
Seventy years have passed since Rosa Parks refused to surrender her seat on a Montgomery bus, and yet the country still tries to shrink her into that single moment — a tired seamstress who’d simply had enough.
Detroit, the city where she chose to continue her life, insists on remembering her differently. Not as an icon frozen in time, but as a Black woman whose lifelong organizing stretched from sexual violence cases in rural Alabama to open housing fights on Detroit’s west side.
That fuller story  — truth beyond the myth — is exactly what the Rosa Parks Scholarship Foundation has fought to tell for 45 years.
The Rosa Parks Scholarship Foundation (RPSF) has awarded more than $3 million in scholarships to more than 2,250 high school seniors since its founding by The Detroit News and the Detroit Public Schools (DPS) in 1980.
“Most people actually don’t know the story of Rosa Parks,” said Dr. Danielle McGuire, RPSF board member, historian and author of “At the Dark End of the Street”, whose research permanently shifted how historians write about Parks and the civil rights movement. “She’s so much more interesting, so much more radical, and so much more involved in all kinds of things that we forget about. We keep her stuck on the bus in Montgomery in 1955.”
According to Kim Trent, a  Detroit civic leader and former board president, the foundation, created through a racial discrimination lawsuit settlement involving Stroh’s Brewing Company, became one of the rare instances where federal accountability for racism produced long-term investment in Black futures.












Most people actually don't know the story of Rosa Parks.


– Dr. Danielle McGuire




A judge, DPS and The Detroit News agreed the money should honor Parks — who was living in Detroit and working for Rep. John Conyers at the time — by funding scholarships for Michigan students devoted to service and social change.
It is a statewide program, reaching students from Detroit to Grand Rapids to rural school districts where scholarship dollars often determine whether higher education is possible at all.
That framing makes her legacy active, not ceremonial.
“As part of her family, I feel grateful to be able to work together with my fellow board members to keep fighting for more opportunities to continue to provide scholarships,” said Erica Thedford, Parks’ great-niece and a foundation trustee. “I think Auntie Rosa would be extremely proud of what the Foundation has been able to achieve.”
The numbers tell one story — more than 1,000 scholars, millions awarded, forty $2,500 scholarships each year — and the essays tell another. Applicants must identify a modern social issue and explain how they would confront it using principles Parks embodied: discipline, non-negotiable dignity, community before self.
“Reading the essays of the students who apply is a great reminder that each person doing one act, no matter how small, creates a stronger network of love and kindness,” Thedford said. “Some of these students come from extreme hardship and still find the time and resources to volunteer at food banks, shelters… Some even take it upon themselves to be the organizer of ways to help the less fortunate at their schools.”
The award is one-time, not renewable, yet its impact stretches across decades.
“Once you become a Rosa Parks Scholarship Foundation recipient, you are a Rosa Parks Scholar for life,” Thedford said. “These students are now part of a network of people who root for each other, and that kind of support system is important.”
Trent knows that firsthand: She was a Parks Scholar herself when she graduated from Cass Tech High School.
“I received the scholarship in 1987,” she said. “Ironically, not only did I get it, but my best friend… also received the same scholarship. And then her son got the scholarship like 30 years later.”
Trent said the scholarship’s origin mirrors Parks’ life — created in response to injustice and sustained through community action.
“It’s one of those rare occasions where something beautiful grew out of an instance of racism and oppression,” Trent said.
Over the years, some Parks Scholars attended community college. Others enrolled at flagship universities. All had to articulate how their education would serve a community beyond themselves.
Some, like Emmy-winning actor Courtney B. Vance, who’s from Highland Park, Michigan, went on to shape national culture. Others are now attorneys, educators and nonprofit leaders across the state.
“What gets lost in what she did is the reason she did it,” Trent added. “It wasn’t just so she could sit on a bus. It was because she was trying to open up opportunity for people who had been denied opportunity.”
That is the heartbeat of the foundation’s lineage.
Parks was not simply resisting segregation. She was rejecting the entire machinery that kept Black women from safety, education and economic autonomy.
McGuire’s research highlights how Rosa Parks was investigating sexual violence cases long before #MeToo, defending Black girls like Recy Taylor, whose voices were dismissed in courtrooms and newspapers. She worked alongside the NAACP on equity cases. When she left Alabama under threat of death and moved to Detroit, she became the neighbor who knew everyone’s children, the church member who attended every meeting, the woman who collected information and names and needs.
“She was the person in the neighborhood who knew all the kids, who worked in almost every community organization you can imagine, to make life better for her people,” McGuire said. “The scholarship foundation is an example of that — just one of many.”
Every year, nearly 400 applicants encounter that fuller history — the Parks who fought for open housing in Detroit, who believed in Black self-determination, who, as McGuire notes, “never stopped fighting for equality and justice for people who didn’t have a voice that was being heard.”
That is not accidental. It is by design.
“We ask our applicants to become familiar with Rosa Parks and the tactics and strategies she used to make changes in her community and how they will do the same,” McGuire said. “I think it gives them hope. It links them to a tradition and a history of hope and change.”
This anniversary of Parks’ arrest arrives as school boards strip Black history from K-12 classrooms and as scholarship programs for marginalized students come under attack. Thedford sees the foundation’s work as a refusal.












No matter how hard people try to cancel the past, the past is very much alive.


– Dr. Danielle McGuire




“During this time, when we are hearing of funding being pulled from schools and programs that are needed to serve our youth, the Foundation is able to continue its provision of funds,” she said.
McGuire is blunt about what that represents:
“No matter how hard people try to cancel the past, the past is very much alive,” she said. “Rosa Parks’ history gives us so much honesty about America… and studying her is paramount to getting through any difficult time.”
Seventy years later, the lesson remains unchanged: Rosa Parks did not fight for a place to sit, she fought for the generations who would rise. Today, those students are still applying, still studying her strategies, still refusing to yield.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Rosa-Parks-statue-Nov-14-2025-700x467-1.jpg,,,2025-12-01 14:57:13.655869

(Photo by Michelle Griffith/Minnesota Reformer)Minneapolis-based attorney Chris Madel, whose high-profile defense of a state trooper charged with murder raised his profile last year, launched a campaign for Minnesota governor Monday. He joins a growing field of candidates who will battle for the Republican nomination.
Madel represented State Patrol Officer Ryan Londregan, who was charged with murder and manslaughter after he shot and killed Ricky Cobb II in 2023. Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty wound up dropping the charges against Londregan.
Madel is also an attorney for the Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association and the conservative news site Alpha News.
“Minnesota has been bled dry by special interests and fraudsters under Tim Walz’s failed leadership,” Madel said in a statement. “This needs to end and it will end with me as governor of Minnesota.”
Madel grew up in Waseca and was a trial attorney in the U.S. Department of Justice’s antitrust division. He has a long history of defending law enforcement and white collar criminals, and he helped the late Minnesota Twins Hall of Famer Kirby Puckett win an acquittal against felony criminal charges in 2003.
Alliance for a Better Minnesota, a well-financed group aligned with Democrats, released a statement, saying Madel would be a “rubber stamp on President Trump’s harmful agenda.” Perhaps seeking to help his Republican opponents, ABM pointed out that Madel has contributed to Walz’s previous campaigns.
Other Republicans running include Minnesota House Speaker Lisa Demuth; Republican Rep. Kristin Robbins; 2022 GOP nominee for governor Scott Jensen; and Kendall Qualls, an army veteran and health care executive.
If Republicans can raise money and blanket the media, they’ll have plenty to work with to attack Walz’s nearly eight years in office, especially the theft of hundreds of millions of dollars from government programs.
In the past week, Walz and the state garnered national attention for the fraud that has infiltrated at least two of Minnesota’s Medicaid programs, in addition to the pandemic food aid program fraud known as the Feeding Our Future scandal. Trump has been attacking Walz and Minnesota’s Somali community for days.
The New York Times over the weekend published a front-page article detailing the fraud that has occurred in recent years.
Walz — who is seeking a third, four-year term — went on “Meet the Press” Sunday, where he was asked about Trump’s comments and his stewardship of Minnesota.
“I take responsibility for putting people in jail. Governors don’t get to just talk theoretically, we have to solve problems. And I will note, it’s not just Somalis. Minnesota is a generous state, Minnesota is a prosperous state, a well-run state. We’re AAA bond rated. But that attracts criminals. Those people are going to jail. We’re doing everything we can. But to demonize an entire community on the actions of a few? It’s lazy,” Walz said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/P1163918-scaled-e1764617500172-1024x635.jpg,,,2025-12-01 14:57:13.655869

(Getty Images)The Florida Bar last week opened a disciplinary file on a Miami Beach City Commission candidate accused of defaming a local filmmaker who reported on her lasting affinity for her father, the serial killer inspiration for “Dexter” executed in 2012.
Monique Pardo Pope, one of two candidates in the Dec. 9 run-off election for the seat, has until the day after the election to respond to allegations that she defamed South Florida filmmaker Billy Corben when she claimed that he’d lost a defamation case.
This came after Corben discovered that her father was Manuel Pardo, an ex-cop turned drug dealer who murdered nine people in the 1980s and was executed for his crimes in 2012. Pardo Pope has since called her father her “hero,” signing off one Instagram post with his last words on the Florida State Prison’s execution table.
Opening a disciplinary file is the second step in a lengthy process to determine whether a Florida attorney has violated the Bar’s rules, although just 25% of yearly complaints against lawyers reach this step. This step simply means that if a complaint’s accusations are proven true, Bar rules would have been violated.
It is not an outright sign of guilt or non-compliance.
“The enclosed letter is an official inquiry by bar counsel,” reads the notice of grievance procedures emailed to Pardo Pope on Nov. 25, five days after Corben filed his Bar complaint.  “If you do not respond, the matter will be forwarded to the grievance committee for disposition … . Failure to respond may also be a matter of contempt.”
The letter asks the candidate to respond to Corben’s allegations by Dec. 10 via mail or email.
What happened?
The case emerged after the Miami New Times picked up Corben’s Sep. 25 report on Instagram that Pardo Pope’s father was a pro-Nazi, anti-Black serial killer executed by the state for the deaths of South Florida drug dealers and bystanders alike. Pardo Pope was four years old when the crimes occurred.
When the Times asked her to respond to Corben’s claims, she accused the filmmaker — known for documentaries like “Cocaine Cowboys” — of making a career off of “slinging mud, which has even resulted in losing a defamation case.”
Corben, who had not lost the defamation case against his movie-making company, in turn filed a Nov. 20 Bar complaint against Pardo Pope for allegedly defaming him.
He told the Phoenix at the time that his complaint was “not about the sins of the father, but about the lies of the daughter.”
When searching the Pardos family’s Hialeah apartment at the time, Corben said, officers found a family dog named “Satan,” tattooed with a swastika, Polaroid photos of Pardo’s victims, and a slew of anti-Black and anti-Jewish memorabilia.
After his death, Pardo Pope lauded her father as a “guiding light” on social media, vowing to bring the “kind of leadership” she learned from her family to City Hall.
“Happiest of Birthdays to this little girl’s first true love — her Daddy. You would’ve been 59 years young today. Missing you each and everyday, mi papi bello….my guiding light in the sky, my eternal best friend,” she wrote in 2015, including a photo of him holding her as a baby.
She signed it off with his final words on the execution table, “Airborne forever, love your Michi girl.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-01 19:22:35+00:00,CT Mirror,New Haven plant now the East Coast’s largest producer of biofuels,P.R. Lockhart and John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/01/american-greenfuels-biodiesel-energy-manufacturing-ct/,American GreenFuels' growth has been spurred by laws requiring fuel dealers to blend home heating oil with biodiesel to reduce emissions.,"Inside a green metal-clad building in the Port of New Haven, a kind of modern day alchemy is at work, turning used cooking oil into fuel capable of powering trucks and heating homes.
Within a maze of tightly stacked tanks, pipes and collection units, workers take the grease — or other available waste products such as animal fats, tallow and vegetable oils — and add an alcohol catalyst to trigger a chemical reaction that produces biodiesel, which is marketed as a more climate friendly alternative to traditional fossil fuels.
A series of rapid expansions in recent years has made the plant, home of American GreenFuels, the largest producer of biodiesel on the East Coast.
Originally opened in 2011 as Greenleaf Biofuels, the plant was later purchased by the American division of Swiss commodities trader Kolmar Group and renamed American GreenFuels. Since 2016, its output has quadrupled, from 15 million gallons to nearly 60 million gallons a year.
The most recent expansion, completed this summer, added a second story to the production floor.
“It often smells like french fries, as you might expect,” said Paul Teta, the vice president and general counsel for Kolmar Americas, which is based in Shelton.
The company’s growth has been spurred, in part, by government subsidies and laws requiring fuel dealers to blend home heating oil with biodiesel in an effort to reduce carbon emissions. Teta declined to say how much the company has invested in its New Haven plant, other than to say it was in the “many millions of dollars.”
According to Kolmar, the biodiesel made at its New Haven facility produces 86% less greenhouse gas emissions, on average, compared with ultralow-sulfur heating oil. The emissions reductions are even more substantial when the fuel is sold and burned in Connecticut, removing the need to transport it long distances on trucks.
New York City passed the nation’s first blended biofuel mandate in 2012 and was followed by a state laws in New York, Connecticut and Rhode Island.
Connecticut’s law, Public Act 181 of 2021, required that heating oils contain at least a 5% blend of biodiesel starting in 2022. That amount increased to 10% this year and is set to grow steadily until reaching a minimum 50% blend in 2035. (Roughly 400 million gallons of fuel oil is delivered each year in Connecticut, according to the Connecticut Energy Marketers Association.)
In addition to state incentives, biodiesel fuels were previously eligible for a $1 per gallon federal tax credit. As a result of the Inflation Reduction Act, those credits were replaced by other tax incentives based on lowering carbon emissions. Despite what he called an “ambiguity” around the changes to federal policy, Teta said that increasing blended fuel ratios in the Northeast has provided stability to the industry.
“When the law got passed, that gave us enough certainty to be able to make the next level of investment,” Teta said.
“The federal program’s certainly still important, because it incentivizes the price, otherwise biodiesel would be more expensive,” he added. “We want to keep the price low. So all put together, it has been a good mix for us to be able to expand.”
A controversial energy source
Not everyone is happy about the push to adopt biofuels. Environmental advocates, including the Sierra Club, have argued that biodiesel perpetuates a reliance on fossil fuels and that states should instead seek to transition as rapidly as possible to all-electric options such as heat pumps.
“Electrification is really the answer for reducing emissions from vehicles and from home heating,” said Samantha Dynowski, the president of the Connecticut chapter of the Sierra Club. “We just want to make sure that our emphasis is on the long term solution, not kind of a bridge, because the more we invest in this, the less you can get off of it.”
Supporters of biofuels, however, say they offer a path for states like to Connecticut to achieve reductions in greenhouse gas emissions over the next several decades. Earlier this year, Gov. Ned Lamont signed a law setting a statewide net-zero emissions target by 2050.

Chris Herb, the president of the Connecticut Energy Marketers Association, said the state’s reliance on natural gas to meet its energy needs, along with the high cost of building out greener technologies such as solar and wind, make the expansion of biofuels essential to meeting to those targets.
“There’s no way to blend [natural gas] down like we can petroleum,” Herb said. “Our industry is the only way we, the state of Connecticut, are going to be able to continue to make gains in carbon dioxide reductions in the fastest, least expensive way.”
But even biodiesel production has faced concerns around environmental pollution. In September, the EPA announced that American GreenFuels will pay $143,000 to settle penalties in the wake of Clean Air Act violations that occurred at the plant between 2020 and 2022. In a press release, the federal agency explained that it “found that the facility failed to control the release of certain air pollutants” during maintenance and system repairs. 
When asked to respond to questions about the violations and the settlement, Kolmar Americas did not offer a detailed response. 
“American GreenFuels, LLC is in compliance with the Clean Air Act,” Teta said in an email.
When it comes to the carbon-reducing benefits of biofuels, it also depends on the kind of feedstock that goes into the production process.
Oils that are processed directly from crops such as soybeans and corn require land clearing and mechanical harvesting that itself produces more emissions than recycled feedstocks such as used cooking oil. Only 36% of the biofuels produced nationally in 2022 came from waste or recycled feedstocks, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
Teta declined to say what percentage of American GreenFuels’ products is recycled, but he said historically the company has sourced most of its feedstock from waste products.
That could change next year, he said, due to the elimination of tax penalties for biofuels derived directly from crops. The change, which was implemented as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act signed by President Donald Trump in July, is likely to result in American GreenFuels using more bean oils in its production.
“We are mindful that we must remain competitive and diffuse the market’s concern that we will be priced out of the market for waste feedstocks and therefore become uncompetitive,” Teta said in an email. 
Currently, Teta said the company sources cooking oil from more than 5,000 locations, including restaurants in New York City where it’s shipped to New Haven on trucks or barges. Middlemen who pick up the oil from the restaurants or food manufacturing facilities are supposed to filter it to remove bits of food and other impurities. Still, workers sometimes have to remove those impurities once the feedstock arrives or rejigger their process based on the types of oil used in frying machines.
“Using all these waste streams, all these different types of oil, it makes it harder on ourselves,” said Sean Hayden, the quality lab manager at American GreenFuels. “Luckily, our formulation is flexible.”
A growing business
The biodiesel industry has expanded considerably in recent years, a shift that has helped expand biodiesel applications beyond transportation to include uses like electric power and heating oil, one of the main uses of biodiesel in Connecticut. Those changes have had broader economic effects: Recent research found the biodiesel industry generated nearly $42.5 billion in economic impact nationally in 2024, along with 107,400 jobs and $5.8 billion in wages.  
While American GreenFuels is one of a handful of East Coast operations, much of the growth in biofuels — a broader category that includes ethanol, biodiesel, and renewable hydrocarbon fuels— has been concentrated in the Midwest. The majority of corn-based ethanol and biodiesel production takes place in states like Illinois, Iowa and Nebraska, where crops used for these fuels are grown. That expansion has led to concerns that some crops, like corn, are being diverted to biofuel production rather than the food supply.

The exact impact of corn-based biofuel production on food supplies and prices has been a point of contention between environmental groups and biofuel supporters. Biodiesel industry experts say other production methods, like the use of soybeans and specific operations like American GreenFuels’ use of previously used oils and fats, sidestep those tensions.
“There’s no food-for-fuel issue,” said Stephen Dodge, the director of state regulatory affairs for Clean Fuels Alliance America, the trade organization that represents American GreenFuels and other member organizations. “It’s not like ethanol.” 
In its latest biodiesel plant production capacity report, the U.S. Energy Information Administration found there were 48 biodiesel production plants operating in the U.S. as of January 2025. Collectively, those plants are capable of producing nearly 2 billion gallons of biodiesel in a year.  
And the industry is expected to grow further. Estimates currently suggest that biodiesel use could top 6 billion gallons by 2030 and reach 15 billion gallons by 2050. 
But production has faced headwinds in 2025, with biodiesel output falling earlier this year due to uncertainty around the future of federal tax credits and lower-than-expected profit margins.
Even so, American GreenFuels’ growth has made it a notable example of the manufacturing industry’s efforts to bounce back in Connecticut. The biodiesel industry supports some 1,250 jobs in the region, according to Clean Fuels Alliance America, and brought in some $47 million in revenue, according to Dodge. 
Supporters of biofuels argue that the energy source can help serve as a transitional step as the country moves towards electrification.

(Photo by Lance Cheung/USDA)The Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship announced Monday that applications were open to farmers, small businesses and nonprofits for cost-share grants to improve processing, equipment, facilities, training, food safety, continuing education and more. 
Iowa producers of locally made and raised products are eligible for up to $25,000 in matching funds, per project, from the state as part of the Choose Iowa program.
Choose Iowa is a network of more than 300 farmers, businesses and nonprofit organizations selling Iowa-made goods. The program is sponsored and marketed by the state. 
In April, IDALS awarded 33 value-added grants to producers. The grant requires a one-to-one match from recipients, which brought the 2025 investment total to $1.3 million for value-added improvements. Awarded projects included storage improvements, well and irrigation systems, automated bagging equipment, refrigeration and on farm-sale systems, according to the April release from IDALS. 
Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said Monday in a news release Choose Iowa funding is helping farmers and small businesses “capture” the momentum building for local Iowa products. 
“These value-added grants make it possible for innovative projects to move from dream to reality, whether that’s expanding processing capacity, upgrading equipment, or creating new customer ready products,” Naig said. “I encourage farmers, small-businesses, and entrepreneurs to learn more and apply. Every successful Choose Iowa project strengthens our rural communities and gives consumers more access to the fresh and local products they are looking for.”
The Legislature allocated $500,000 for the value-added grants in 2025-2026 fiscal year. The Legislature also stipulated another $500,000 of the Choose Iowa total budget would go to the program’s dairy innovation grants, which similarly help local dairies with infrastructure and training improvement
Since 2022 IDALS has funded 100 projects with the Choose Iowa value-added grant program, with a total state investment of $1.6 million. 
Applications for the grant, and additional instructions are available online, where they must be submitted before noon on Jan. 16, 2026. IDALS said recipients of the grants will be announced in the spring.

(Phto by Michael Moline/Florida Phoenix)President Donald Trump’s unprecedented plan to redraw state congressional maps to preserve the GOP’s narrow majority in the House ahead of the 2026 election has hit some bumps, but Republicans appear confident they can flip several Democratic seats in Florida, where the first steps in that process will begin this week.
A select House committee on congressional redistricting will convene Thursday afternoon in Tallahassee. It’s the first legislative meeting on the issue since Gov. Ron DeSantis said in July that it would be “appropriate to do a redistricting” in the middle of the decade. He followed up on that in August, saying that he and Attorney General James Uthmeier supported an update to the 2020 Decennial Census.
DeSantis said Florida had been “shortchanged in the reapportionment stemming from the last census” in 2020, although no new update to that census has taken place.
Florida House Democratic Leader Fentrice Driskell slammed the proposal Monday, saying the only reason it is happening is because Trump wants to “rig” next year’s midterm elections because “he wants to stop Americans from holding his administration accountable for their bad decisions.”
‘Swamp-like cynical behavior’
“Any attempt to draw new maps in Florida right now is a direct response to the president’s pressure to stack the deck before the midterms, and that is illegal in Florida,” Driskell said on a Zoom press conference for Florida reporters.
“The Fair Districts amendments to the Florida Constitution outlaw drawing maps to benefit one party over another. Redistricting decides who represents us in our government. A process that must serve the people, not politicians. This isn’t something that the people asked for. This is just the swamp-like cynical behavior that people hate about politics.”
Florida’s Fair District amendments prohibit line-drawing that intentionally favors or disfavors a political party or incumbent.
With the Democrats in superminority status in both chambers of the Legislature, Driskell acknowledged her party can’t stop GOP members but said she is putting some hope in the Senate rejecting the move.
“We don’t have the numbers to stop this, but we haven’t seen what’s going to happen in the Senate yet and, interestingly, more and more we’re watching our state Senate become a backstop to guard against some of the more dangerous whims of the legislation that we see coming out from the House.”
Senate Republicans, who hold a 26-11 advantage over Democrats in that chamber, haven’t said much about the idea of congressional redistricting since the governor’s comments over the summer.
“I’d like to see some data on the magnitude of people in the state of Florida who might be here illegally who have been part of the calculation on re-districting,” Pinellas County Republican state Sen. Nick DiCeglie told the Phoenix last month.
“I think that we should have redistricting based on United States citizens, and we’ll see how that plays out here, if possible. It’s always good to focus on U.S. citizens and see exactly what needs to be done to accomplish that.”
Senate President Ben Albritton hasn’t made any comments about redistricting, and no committee that would oversee the issue has been formed yet in that chamber.
Driskell said she has taken solace from the fact that several Republicans in Indiana have spoken critically of congressional redistricting in their state. However, after pressure from the White House, Indiana House Republicans Monday proposed a redrawing that would let their party control all nine House seats (Democrats hold two of the state’s nine seats).
The first congressional redistricting took place in Texas earlier this year. That came after Trump said during the summer that Republicans were “entitled to five more seats” in the Lone Star State.
A federal court blocked Texas last month from using its new map, ruling that it is likely an unconstitutional racial gerrymander, and ordered the state to use its previous map in the 2026 election. The new map is now back in place, at least temporarily, after Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito granted the state’s request to pause that federal court’s ruling.
Tampa Bay-area Democratic U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor says Tallahassee Republicans should be focused on lowering Floridians’ property insurance and electricity bills, not redistricting. “I think it’s a waste of time and money,” she told the Phoenix last week.
Florida Republicans represent 20 of the state’s 28 congressional districts.
Ahead of the committee meeting Thursday, a group of voting and civil rights organizations calling themselves the “No Partisan Maps” coalition are scheduled to hold a protest in front of the Capitol. The Florida House Select Committee hearing on congressional redistricting will begin at 1:30 p.m.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/IMG_0003-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-01 14:57:13.655869

(Photo via James Clark, Facebook)A veteran from East Machias has entered the running for the open seat in Maine’s 2nd Congressional District.
James Clark filed to run for the now open seat in what is often considered one of the most hotly contested U.S. House seats in the country, according to paperwork filed with the Federal Elections Commission. He’s running as a Republican, which tees up a primary next June between Clark and former Maine governor Paul LePage.
Clark was a registered Democrat for years, but left because he believes he can “do the most good” with like-minded people in the Republican Party, according to his campaign website. 
Democratic U.S. Rep. Jared Golden, who has held the seat for eight years, said in early November that he would not seek reelection next year. In his announcement, Golden said he hoped his exit would clear the way for competitive primaries for both parties.
With Golden out of the running, there are currently three Democrats vying for the seat as well, including State Auditor Matt Dunlap, Louis Sigel, who formerly served as secretary for the Kennebec County Democratic Committee, and Jordan Wood, who switched from the race to unseat U.S. Sen. Susan Collins to the CD2 election after Golden’s announcement.
To qualify for the primaries, candidates for the U.S. House must gather between 1,000 and 1,250 signatures from registered voters by mid-March. Candidates can start circulating petitions after the new year.
Though the district has been held by a Democrat in recent years, 2nd District voters also backed President Donald Trump three times. 
In addition to fighting for free speech, excellence in education, secure borders, lower costs and smaller government, Clark described himself on his website as “pro-working class, pro-family, pro-opportunity, and very anti-authoritarian.”
With undiagnosed dyslexia and struggling grades, Clark said he dropped out during his sophomore year of high school and later enlisted in the military. 
He cites his difficulty in school as motivating his desire to see Maine and the nation receive top ranking for education. He would like to see more support for students to explore careers in the trades, as well as increased critical thinking, art and music education.
Campaign sweatshirts and other merchandise highlight the fact that Clark is “not a politician” while a page explaining his commitment to “unity, equality and fair opportunity” quotes philosophers including Frederick Douglass and Alexis de Toucqueville.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/547941085_10161606171392539_8864802727047476566_n-e1764612149676.jpg,,,2025-12-01 14:57:13.655869

(Franklin County Property Valuation Administrator photo)The Kentucky Democratic Party has sold its longtime headquarters near Interstate 64 and plans to move to a new office in downtown Frankfort. 
The state party, which has seen its power dwindle in recent decades, will move to an office on Ann Street Friday, Dec. 5, in hopes of being more accessible to lawmakers, advocates and reporters working at the state Capitol.
The Kentucky Democratic Party (KDP) finalized the sale of the building on Tuesday to a business, Means Drive of Nicholasville, for $540,000, according to Franklin County property records.
Democrats bought the site on Democrat Drive near I-64 in 1973 for $25,000. The building was named in honor of former Democratic U.S. Sen. Wendell H. Ford, who represented the state in Washington until 1999. He was governor at the time the party bought the property.
The Republican Party of Kentucky, which celebrated the grand opening of an expansion of its party headquarters in November, called the Democrats’ move “another sign of their continual decline.” Around the turn of the 21st century, Democrats began losing ground in Kentucky, as Republican nominees regularly won the state’s electoral votes in presidential elections and the congressional delegation became a majority of Republicans. The GOP eventually took an overwhelming majority of seats in the state House and Senate. 
“Since Governor Beshear took office Kentucky Republicans have flipped voter registration, expanded our supermajorities and now hold nearly every federal and constitutional office,” said RPK spokesman Adam Hope in a statement. “The Beshear playbook is simple. Ride Republican success while ignoring the collapse happening inside your own party.”
However, KDP said the Republicans should have bigger concerns than where the Democrats’ headquarters is. 
“The Republican Party of Kentucky should be more concerned about Kentuckians losing jobs, food and health care as a result of the GOP-backed federal budget than they are about KDP headquarters,” said KDP Executive Director Morgan Eaves. “But we haven’t seen a GOP press release on those issues in a long time.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/kdphq-1024x576.jpeg,,,2025-12-01 13:57:45.229773

The Committee has directed inquiries to the Department, and we will be conducting vigorous oversight to determine the facts related to these circumstances,” Wicker and Reed said.Similarly, House Armed Services Committee Chair Mike Rogers, R-Ala., and ranking member Adam Smith, D-Wash., said in a joint statement Saturday that the panel “is committed to providing rigorous oversight of the Department of Defense’s military operations in the Caribbean.”“We take seriously the reports of follow-on strikes on boats alleged to be ferrying narcotics in the SOUTHCOM region and are taking bipartisan action to gather a full accounting of the operation in question,” according to the statement.The inquiries mark a rare bipartisan check on President Donald Trump’s administration since his second term began in January. With the exception of voting to release the federal case files on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, which Trump eventually endorsed, Republicans have largely left Trump’s decisions and policies unchallenged.Follow-on attack reportedLawmakers’ attention was retrained on the already legally questionable U.S. operations targeting alleged narcotics boats after an investigative report published Friday by The Washington Post revealed Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth gave verbal orders to kill everyone during a Sept. 2 operation —  the first of several U.S. boat strikes in the Caribbean Sea that have killed roughly 80.According to the report, two survivors clung to burning wreckage after an initial hit. Adm. Frank M. “Mitch” Bradley, who was commanding the attack from Fort Bragg in North Carolina, ordered a second, or follow-on, strike to fulfill Hegseth’s order and kill the remaining survivors. States Newsroom has not independently confirmed the details.Hegseth called the report “fabricated, inflammatory, and derogatory,” in a post on social media Friday.Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., told CBS News’ “Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan” on Sunday the follow-on strike could rise “to the level of a war crime if it’s true.”""If that reporting is true, it's a clear violation of the DoD's own laws of war, as well as international laws about the way you treat people who are in that circumstance,"" Kaine said.A working group of former military lawyers issued a statement Friday urging Congress to investigate the Sept. 2 strike.“Since orders to kill survivors of an attack at sea are ‘patently illegal,’ anyone who issues or follows such orders can and should be prosecuted for war crimes, murder, or both,” according to the statement published by Just Security, a journal focused on national security published by the New York University School of Law Reiss Center on Law and Security.A bipartisan effort, led by Kaine, to stop Trump’s deadly strikes in the Caribbean narrowly failed in the Senate in early November.Trump echoes Hegseth denialTrump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday he “wouldn’t have wanted that” when asked about the alleged follow-on strike that killed the two survivors.“The first strike was very lethal. It was fine, and if there were two people around — but Pete (Hegseth) said that didn't happen,” Trump told reporters. “Pete said he did not order the death of those two men,” Trump continued in a back-and-forth with the press.Trump also said Saturday he was closing the airspace above Venezuela, but told a reporter who asked Sunday if the move previewed a U.S. airstrike of the country not to “read anything into it.”“To all Airlines, Pilots, Drug Dealers, and Human Traffickers, please consider THE AIRSPACE ABOVE AND SURROUNDING VENEZUELA TO BE CLOSED IN ITS ENTIRETY,” he wrote on his own social media platform just before 8 a.m. Eastern Saturday.Trump confirmed reports he spoke to Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro late last month but would not reveal details of the conversation.The U.S. has been amassing Navy vessels and troops off the coast of Venezuela for months, including the recent addition in mid-November of the Navy’s most advanced aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald Ford.",,,,2025-12-01 13:57:45.229773

Dick Harpootlian, seen during a South Carolina Senate Judiciary Committee meeting in Columbia, S.C. on Tuesday, March 15, 2022, is the author of a book about famous serial killer Pee Wee Gaskins. (Travis Bell/STATEHOUSE CAROLINA/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — During a break in the 1983 trial that sent Donald “Pee Wee” Gaskins to death row, the serial killer called for prosecutor Dick Harpootlian.
“You know, you’re just like me,” Gaskins said.
“You like killing,” Gaskins added. When Harpootlian asked what he meant, Gaskins told him, “You like killing me.”
That interaction stuck with Harpootlian, a Columbia attorney and former state senator. He wanted for years to write a book about Gaskins’ life and the 13 people he confessed to killing during the 1970s but struggled with how to frame it. The moral question he faced over pursuing the death penalty became his angle, he said.
Gaskins “was pure evil, and he got in my head,” Harpootlian said. “The book is about how I got to where I got, how he got to where he got, and how you wrestle with that.”
Harpootlian’s book, “Dig Me A Grave,” comes out Dec. 16.
Harpootlian will launch the book that evening in a conversation with Dawn Staley, coach of the University of South Carolina’s women’s basketball team and a true crime fan, at Columbia’s 701 Whaley event space.
Soon after Gaskins was executed in 1991, a clerk asked Harpootlian if he wanted to keep any evidence from the case. Looking through photographs, records of Gaskins’ arrest and the 300-page written confession Gaskins gave in 1978, Harpootlian realized there was enough for a book, he said. He kept all of it.
“It was a treasure trove of files on Gaskins,” said Harpootlian, a Democrat later elected to Richland County Council and as 5th Circuit solicitor (chief prosecutor for Richland and Kershaw counties) before he became a defense attorney. In 2018, voters sent the former state Democratic Party chairman to the state Senate.
When the COVID-19 pandemic ended the legislative session early and suspended trials, Harpootlian decided to get serious about telling Gaskins’ story. An agent got him in touch with author and journalist Shaun Assael, whose most recent book explored the death of boxer Sonny Liston.
Together, Harpootlian and Assael combed through the old case files and interviewed police officers and other witnesses involved in Gaskins’ investigations and trials. Harpootlian wrote down what he could recall and checked his own memories against those of other people involved, he said.
“I think there’s less speculation in this book than any other true crime book I’ve ever read, because I was there,” Harpootlian said. “I prosecuted. I saw every document. We interviewed every witness. I was in the courtroom for six weeks.”
Harpootlian was even on a first-name basis with Gaskins, a first for the then-prosecutor. The killer could charm just about anyone, and on his first day in the courtroom, he greeted Harpootlian by name.
“From then on, it was Dick and Pee Wee,” Harpootlian said.
Preparing to prosecute Gaskins for the killing of fellow inmate Rudolph Tyner, Harpootlian learned all the brutal details of how Gaskins killed at least 13 people and raped several of them. Gaskins drowned, beat and shot his victims to death, including a 2-year-old and her pregnant mother.
Gaskins later claimed he killed dozens more, but investigators only definitively linked him to those 13 cases.
Although a jury recommended the death penalty during Gaskins’ first murder trial in 1976, after finding him guilty of one of the killings, the state Supreme Court later changed his sentence to life in prison, finding the state’s law about executions unconstitutional.
A year later, a second jury found Gaskins guilty of killing farmer Silas Yates, but because the state’s death penalty law was still considered unconstitutional, Gaskins received another life sentence. Facing a third murder trial, Gaskins pleaded guilty to the 13 killings investigators had linked to him in exchange for eight more life sentences.
By the time Harpootlian stepped in to prosecute the 1982 killing of Tyner, a U.S. Supreme Court decision reinstating the death penalty nationwide made it an option once again. Harpootlian just had to decide whether to try again for a death sentence or allow Gaskins to remain in prison for the rest of his life.
The decision weighed on Harpootlian. He personally opposed the death penalty, but as a prosecutor, he took an oath to uphold the law, he said.
He also had to weigh any decision he made in the context of his own political ambitions.
Harpootlian went to his father, a World War II bomber, for advice. When Harpootlian asked whether his father regretted his actions during the war, his dad responded that everything he did was in self-defense.
Considering Gaskins found a way to kill a man inside the state’s most secure prison facility, Harpootlian decided the same thinking applied in his decision. Executing Gaskins would prevent him from harming anyone else in a way prison walls couldn’t, he said.
“I think the death penalty is appropriate where it’s self-defense,” Harpootlian said. “And Gaskins is self-defense.”
That much was clear when Gaskins attempted to hire someone to kidnap Harpootlian’s then-4-year-old daughter ahead of his execution date, Harpootlian said. When the time came for Gaskins’ 1991 execution, Harpootlian decided not to attend, in part out of fear over leaving his family alone and in part because he didn’t want to watch a man die.
Death row inmate becomes 3rd in SC executed by firing squad

“Wanting to watch somebody die would be what Pee Wee would do,” Harpootlian said. “And I’m not him.”
Grisly descriptions of Gaskins’ death in the electric chair prompted Harpootlian to propose as a legislator giving death row inmates a firing squad option.
His proposal came during Senate floor debate on legislation reverting to electrocution as the state’s primary execution method, which was signed into law in May 2021. Since the state Supreme Court upheld that law last year, three inmates have chosen to die by firing squad.
Harpootlian again ended up in the national spotlight defending Alex Murdaugh, who was convicted in 2023 of killing his wife and son two years prior. Perhaps one day he’ll write a book about that saga, which captured the attention of millions of people, he said.
But Gaskins’ story felt too unique to ignore, he added.
“Gaskins is, thank god, one of a kind,” Harpootlian said. “He was the most evil man I’ve ever met, and when you spend time with and become on a first name basis with evil, it haunts you even after he’s dead.”

Iowa Board of Regents President Sherry Bates announced Monday in a news release she will resign from the governing board Dec. 4, the day after a meeting is scheduled to elect new leaders. President Pro Tem Greta Rouse also stated she will step down from the position but remain on the board as a member. Her term as regent expires in 2027.
Bates said in the release she’s been “fortunate enough to serve on the board for nearly 11 years,” during which she worked with “outstanding” regents and staff, both for the board and universities, to accomplish their duties.

“It’s time for me to step back, spend more time with my family, and allow the next generation of Regent leadership to continue our good work,” Bates said in the release. “Iowa, Iowa State and UNI are among the best public universities in the country, and I look forward to seeing them continue to grow and excel.”
She also thanked Gov. Kim Reynolds and former Gov. Terry Branstad, who appointed and reappointed her to the board during her service. Bates’ term was set to end April 30, 2029, the release stated.
Rouse, who first served on the board as a student regent from 2008-2012, was appointed by Reynolds to the board again in 2021. She stated in the release she wants to focus on her family and “still young” children, and being a leader on the board is an “additional time commitment.”
“Iowa’s universities inspire the next generation, drive our economy, advance research, and enrich communities across the state,” Rouse said in the release. “Stepping down from leadership will allow me to do that while continuing to support their important work.”
Rep. Taylor Collins, R-Mediapolis, released a statement on the announcement from Bates and Rouse, saying the changes in leadership “presents an opportunity to chart a new path for the Iowa Board of Regents.”
Collins has been outspoken about decisions made by the board of regents as well as state universities, including when university employees came under fire for discussing circumventing diversity, equity and inclusion changes on campus and posting on social media about right-wing influencer Charlie Kirk after his death and when President Donald Trump announced a new higher education compact.
“For years now, lawmakers have called for a change in direction for not only our universities, but also the Board of Regents,” Collins said in his statement. “I look forward to working with the next board president to continue to reform Iowa’s higher education system.”

Oct. 18, 2025. (Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)A key environmentally-focused political group in Maine is backing Hannah Pingree for governor. 
Maine Conservation Voters Action Fund announced its support for the Democrat at a news conference Monday in Portland. The political action committee picked Pingree for the June 9 primary from a crowded field of big name Democrats because of her work related to climate change and transitioning to clean energy. 
Though the organization works to elect “climate and environmental champions” to serve as state legislators and governor, this is the first time it has made an endorsement in a gubernatorial primary.
“Maine needs a governor who has the courage to stand up to President Trump, and the savvy to win when she does. We need a governor who can build lasting coalitions and bring people together, but who will never compromise on her values and will fight for Maine’s people and communities,” said Maureen Drouin, executive director of Maine Conservation Voters.
So far in the president’s second term, the Trump administration has enacted a sweeping agenda to roll back environmental regulations, including on coal-fired power plants, water pollution, vehicle emissions and more. The administration has also sought to downplay the impact of global warming, such as with an executive order to remove signs throughout the nation’s national parks that explained how climate change was contributing to changing landscapes and what steps visitors could take to reduce their carbon emissions.
In light of that federal posture, the group highlighted Pingree’s current and former work in Maine to protect natural resources and public health. The speakers at the news conference Monday specifically mentioned legislation she sponsored as a state representative in 2008 to reduce children’s exposure to concerning chemicals, as well as a 2007 bill she led to ban toxic chemical flame retardants.
Pingree’s more recent work as part of the administration of Gov. Janet Mills also helped win her the favor of Maine Conservation Voters. As co-chair of the Maine Climate Council, she helped develop the state’s climate action plan. Through that work, the state created a storm recovery fund and programs to protect working waterfronts and other critical infrastructure from climate catastrophes. 
Pingree, who said she was honored to earn this endorsement, said that she would continue to fight on behalf of Maine’s people and environment if elected governor. She noted that she’s spent most of her life living in the island town of North Haven, including the time she served in the Maine House “representing my neighbors who make a living on the ocean where a clean environment is tied to livelihoods and the future of our communities.”
From 2019 to earlier this year, Pingree served as director of Maine’s Office of Policy Innovation and the Future, where she worked to make the state more resilient against extreme weather and led initiatives to help people lower their energy costs and transition their homes from fossil fuels to heat pumps.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-01 17:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"With $10M CDC grant, New Haven County seeks to battle stigma of opioid misuse",Sujata Srinivasan | Connecticut Public,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/01/new-haven-opioid-use-disorder-cdc-grant/,A new campaign in New Haven County is seeking to increase the number of people seeking treatment for opioid misuse disorders.,"A new campaign in New Haven County is seeking to increase the number of people seeking treatment for opioid misuse disorders.
It’s called End Stigma CT and is backed by a $10 million federal grant from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Stigma can lead to social isolation and prevent people from seeking treatment for a substance use disorder, according to the 2024 Shatterproof Addiction Stigma Index (SASI).
Stigma can take many forms: ER staff showing a bias when assessing pain in patients with substance use disorders, or people with substance use disorders avoiding police in emergencies because they fear arrest.
And stigma is a reality playing out across the country, including New Haven County, said Maritza Bond, health commissioner for the city of New Haven.
“Last year we saw that one in five individuals, who needed treatment for a substance use disorder received it,” Bond said, citing national data. “We want to increase that number.”
The campaign’s theme “It Started With” seeks to educate the community about stigma’s impact on people seeking help and to build empathy around how drug use can start for many people.
The concept was created following research with people who shared their experiences with opioids after an injury, or to cope with emotional or mental trauma like losing a family member, a divorce, or post traumatic stress disorder.
“Research shows that stigma is one of the greatest obstacles people face when trying to seek help,” Austin Telfold, overdose prevention navigator, Naugatuck Valley Health District, said in a statement. “We want our community to understand that addiction is not a moral failure — it’s a health condition that deserves empathy, treatment, and hope.”
The grant money will be used to hire patient navigators to go into communities and talk about stigma.
In the Eastshore Health District, which includes Guilford, Madison, Branford, East Haven and North Branford, stigma could look like denying that substance use exists in wealthy communities, said Theresa Heier, a nurse with Eastshore.
But substance use is a problem in wealthier communities, too, she said.
“It’s happening mostly in the home,” she said. “It’s not exactly happening on the streets where they can see it.”
“Part of the stigma campaign, we go into the community and try to normalize that, yes, this is a chronic disorder, just like diabetes or heart disease or anything else,” Heier said.
The grant runs through 2028.

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)President Donald Trump suffered another loss Monday in his ongoing fight to make his former personal lawyer the top federal prosecutor in New Jersey, with a federal appellate panel upholding a lower court ruling that disqualified Alina Habba from the post.
U.S. Third Circuit Judge D. Michael Fisher, writing for a unanimous three-judge panel, said Habba’s continued service in a job she first took in March violates the Federal Vacancies Reform Act and undercuts constitutional protections meant to ensure the three branches of government remain separate but equal.
Fisher barred Habba from the job, affirming U.S. District Judge Matthew Brann’s August ruling, which Brann had put on hold pending appeal. This is a fight the Trump administration has been waging elsewhere in the country, including Virginia and Nevada, so Monday’s precedential ruling promises far-ranging impact.
Fisher noted that the Senate did not act to confirm Habba within the 120 days the Preserving United States Attorney Independence Act requires, triggering a provision in the 2007 law that authorizes federal judges to appoint an interim replacement if the clock runs out without Senate action.
When New Jersey’s federal judges appointed Desiree Leigh Grace in July instead of Habba, Trump administration officials fired her and resorted to a string of maneuvers to keep Habba in the job. Those maneuvers served to “sidestep” the Federal Vacancies Reform Act and statutory requirements reflecting Congress’s intent for someone with “a breadth of experience to properly lead the office,” Fisher wrote.
“It is apparent that the current administration has been frustrated by some of the legal and political barriers to getting its appointees in place,” Fisher wrote. “Its efforts to elevate its preferred candidate for U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey, Alina Habba, to the role of Acting U.S. Attorney demonstrate the difficulties it has faced — yet the citizens of New Jersey and the loyal employees in the U.S. Attorney’s Office deserve some clarity and stability.”
Fisher’s ruling, which came after both sides argued the case in October in Philadelphia, did not answer the question of who is the U.S. attorney in New Jersey, with Habba now disqualified. Spokespeople in the New Jersey U.S. Attorney’s office and the Department of Justice did not respond to requests for comment.
Others celebrated the decision.
Abbe David Lowell, Gerald Krovatin, and Norm Eisen, three of the attorneys who had challenged Habba’s authority, vowed to continue challenging “President Trump’s unlawful appointments of purported U.S. Attorneys wherever appropriate.”
“The court’s decision affirms that U.S. Attorney Alina Habba is unlawfully and invalidly serving as the chief federal law enforcement officer in New Jersey, marking the first time an appeals court has ruled that President Trump cannot usurp longstanding statutory and constitutional processes to insert whomever he wants in these positions,” the attorneys wrote in a statement.
U.S. Sens. Cory Booker and Andy Kim, Democrats whose support the Trump administration would need to advance a U.S. attorney nominee for New Jersey, hailed Monday’s ruling as one that vindicates their concerns about the “extraordinary and unlawful steps taken by the Trump Administration to keep Habba in office without Senate confirmation.”
“The Court’s ruling underscores a simple but fundamental principle: U.S. Attorneys must be independent and installed consistent with the rule of law, not because of their political loyalty or through political maneuvering. The Trump Administration’s attempt to bypass clear legal requirements to install a loyalist undermined the legitimacy of the U.S. Attorney’s Office in New Jersey and cast a shadow over the cases she oversaw,” they said in a joint statement.
The panel that issued Monday’s decision includes two Bush appointees — Fisher and Judge D. Brooks Smith, who are both senior judges. The third judge on the panel, L. Felipe Restrepo, is an Obama appointee.
Observers expect the case could end up before the U.S. Supreme Court.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-01 16:46:09+00:00,CT Mirror,¿Por qué detuvieron las renovaciones de las escuelas públicas de Hartford?,Mariana Navarrete Villegas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/01/hartford-pausa-renovaciones-escuelas-publicas/,Las renovaciones de seis escuelas formaron parte de un esfuerzo para que los residentes de Hartford regresaran a estudiar al distrito.,"Read this story in English.
Cuando el alcalde de Hartford, Arunan Arulampalam, anunció en septiembre la pausa de las renovaciones financiadas por el estado de seis escuelas públicas, la decisión sorprendió a la Junta de Educación y al Comité de Construcción Escolar de Hartford.
La Junta y el Comité habían votado a favor junto con el Ayuntamiento, para que las renovaciones se llevaran a cabo en las escuelas primarias Moylan, Parkville Community, McDonough Middle, S.A.N.D, Maria C. Colon Sanchez Elementary y Batchelder.
Ya estaba aprobada la financiación estatal.
Las renovaciones escolares formaron parte de un esfuerzo para que los residentes de Hartford regresaran a estudiar al distrito. En los últimos cuatro años, aproximadamente 5.000 estudiantes se mudaron fuera de la ciudad. Muchos de los cuales se reubicaron en lugares como New Britain, East Hartford y Manchester, según un análisis de las tendencias de matriculación estudiantil realizado por Caitlin Richard, directora financiera de las Escuelas Públicas de Hartford, presentado en una reunión de la Junta de Educación en noviembre.
Esto es lo que sabemos sobre la pausa en las renovaciones de escuelas públicas.
¿Por qué las escuelas públicas de Hartford planearon renovaciones?
Los proyectos buscaban abordar problemas que llevan años arrastrándose en los edificios de las Escuelas Públicas de Hartford, como goteras en los techos y sistemas de climatización anticuados, e incorporar instalaciones de última generación. La presidenta de la Junta de Educación, Shonta Browdy, dijo que la falta de instalaciones de vanguardia aleja a los residentes de Hartford hacia distritos que sí las ofrecen.
Las renovaciones entonces, buscan abordar la baja matrícula actual en las escuelas públicas de Hartford.
¿Como es el proceso de construcción de escuelas y en qué momento se detuvo?
Es un proceso largo que involucra a múltiples actores interesados que proponen, supervisan y aprueban proyectos de renovación de la construcción de escuelas.
Primero, el distrito escolar identifica la necesidad de renovaciones. Consultores y otros profesionales pueden participar en el proceso de documentación, considerando la matrícula estudiantil, las necesidades del edificio y los programas académicos.
Luego, la Junta de Educación prepara las especificaciones educativas con los costos del proyecto y las cifras de matrícula para los próximos ocho años. Una vez que la ciudad las aprueba, la Junta y el Ayuntamiento están autorizados a presentar una solicitud de subvención al estado, y la Oficina de Subvenciones y Revisión de Construcción Escolar evalúa la propuesta.
Si la propuesta se aprueba, como fue el caso de las seis escuelas públicas de Hartford, el estado emite una carta de compromiso de subvención. El comité de construcción escolar de la ciudad contrata además a gerentes de programa y construcción, y a arquitectos.
Luego, antes de iniciar la licitación de las obras de construcción, que es autorizada por la oficina de construcción escolar del estado, se elaboran, revisan y aprueban los diseños. La construcción comienza entonces.
Los proyectos se suspendieron casi al final de este proceso. Las empresas constructoras ya presentaron sus ofertas y el Comité de Construcción Escolar de Hartford votó a favor de las propuestas de diseño para las escuelas.
A continuación, presentamos los nombres de las empresas constructoras seleccionadas, según la información proporcionada por Browdy:

S.A.N.D. tiene un contrato con Colliers;
Las escuelas primarias Sanchez y Batchelder con Arcadis y O&G;
McDonough Middle con PDS Engineering and Construction Inc.;
Parkville Community con 7 Summits Construction;
y la escuela primaria Moylan con Newfield Construction.

¿Qué dice el alcalde sobre su razonamiento para pausar las renovaciones de las escuelas?
Cristian Corza-Godinez, portavoz de la ciudad de Hartford, declaró por escrito que el ‘statu quo’ no beneficia a los estudiantes, por lo que el alcalde está trabajando en un plan de cinco años para convertir las escuelas en ‘centros de excelencia’. Añadió que esto requiere conversaciones alrededor de si la ciudad está agotando los recursos en las escuelas con baja matriculación.
Corza-Godinez sostuvo que, hasta que la ciudad tenga un plan para abordar este problema, pausar la construcción de las escuelas es la decisión responsable.
“Si usamos fondos estatales para llevar a cabo estos seis proyectos de construcción, las personas que pagan impuestos de Hartford quedarán obligados durante veinte años y tendrán que devolver ese dinero si alguna de esas seis escuelas toma un rumbo distinto en las próximas dos décadas”, dijo.
En la reunión del comité de construcción escolar del 20 de octubre, Lori Mizerak, asesora legal de la ciudad, declaró que envió un memorando el 17 de octubre sobre los planes de la ciudad para evaluar todas las escuelas de la ciudad que enfrentan problemas presupuestarios. El memorando no lo hicieron disponible al público.
¿Cuáles son los próximos pasos para estos proyectos?
Por el momento, las renovaciones están en pausa y no hay una fecha fija para la reanudación de la construcción.
Arulampalam aseguró que la ciudad desea reanudar la construcción lo antes posible y espera que todos los actores se reúnan para colaborar en un plan que ofrezca mejores resultados educativos a los estudiantes de Hartford, de modo que puedan ofrecer no solo edificios con mejor diseño, sino también una educación sustancialmente mejor.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_7869-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-12-01 11:58:54.878487

(Submitted) TOPEKA — Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas and Topeka’s St. Francis hospital have failed to reach a contract agreement, leaving insurance customers out of network beginning Jan. 1 for one of Topeka’s major health care systems.
Officials with both organizations say discussions are ongoing. The current contract ends Dec. 31.
“We’re having productive talks,” said Matt All, president and CEO of BCBS of Kansas. “It’s a little complicated because they have an out-of-state owner, so we’re not just talking to people here on the ground.”
“I’m not in the business of making predictions, but our expectation is that we’ll work this out and that they’ll be in network,” he added.
Topeka’s St. Francis campus is owned by Ardent Health, which manages operations, and the University of Kansas Health System. Ardent is based in Brentwood, Tennessee.

People covered by BCBS of Kansas have been posting social media messages, upset about the possible loss of their doctors.
“I refuse to abandon my primary care provider whom I trust with my care, so Blue Cross Blue Shield just lost another customer,” said Topekan Carol Baldwin on her personal Facebook page.
In an emailed statement to Kansas Reflector, hospital officials said: “The University of Kansas Health System St. Francis Campus is committed to protecting access to high-quality care for our community. We have made repeated efforts to engage directly with senior decision-makers at Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas and remain committed to negotiating in good faith to reach a fair resolution.”
Rising costs in health care are causing the challenge in reaching agreement, both sides said. For All, the discussions are indicative of broader problems throughout the health care system.
“We are seeking an agreement that reimburses St. Francis Campus at rates consistent with rising costs due to inflation and supply chain pressures,” the hospital’s statement said. “Equitable reimbursement rates are critical to supporting the high-quality care that our patients deserve.”
All said BCBS, which is a mutual nonprofit that is created to benefit its members, must negotiate so that reimbursements to the hospital are reasonable and don’t translate into premiums that members can’t afford.
“For the whole 19 years I’ve been with Blue Cross, and basically our whole history, we’ve had every hospital in our service area in network, and we want St. Francis in network,” he said.
Changes needed
There are many good things about the country’s health care, All said, but the availability of resources isn’t evenly spread out.
“We have too many people that can’t afford coverage,” All said. “The big problem in American health care that’s existed for as long as any of us have been thinking about this is that it doesn’t control costs very well, and so there’s this steady rise in costs over the decades, and some decades are faster than others.”
For the years 2024 through 2033, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention predicts that national health expenditures will grow 5.8%.
“Across the industry, in every market, whether you’re talking about commercial plans, the public programs and so forth, costs are rising really quickly right now,” All said. “We’ve seen it in our plan and when you combine that with possibly losing some of the subsidies in the (Affordable Care Act) market, you’re going to have some consumers that are just going to be priced out of the market.”
“That should be unacceptable to us,” All added. “In 2025, in a nation as prosperous as ours, we should be able to make sure that everybody can afford good health care.”
The health care system needs a major overhaul, All said, but having what he called an “adult conversation” on the topic is difficult.
“We need to really talk about the root causes of higher costs and the toll that takes, but also the consequences of controlling costs, because there’s another side to this,” he said. “The fact that we’re able to have two beautiful hospitals in Topeka, two great hospitals in Wichita, a beautiful hospital in Lawrence, and you can actually go there and get care — that is partly because we fund our health care system really lavishly.”
But that system isn’t working if people don’t have access to it, All said.
“If we solve the cost problem, we can solve all of the other problems,” he said. “The other problems are just technical. At that point, we have to get the cost problem solved, and we just haven’t been willing to do it yet as a country.”
Health expenses
The Commonwealth Fund, a foundation that focuses on affordable health care, compared U.S. health care costs to those in 12 countries. It found the U.S. pays more for:

Insurance administrative costs, responsible for about 15% of the excess costs.
Administrative activities, 15% of excess.
Prescription drugs, 10% of excess.
Physician salaries, 10% of excess.
Registered nurse salaries, 5% of excess.
Investments in medical machinery and equipment, less than 5%. 

The U.S. industry is highly concentrated, All said, with about 20% of health care dollars spent on 1% of the population and more than half of health care dollars on about 5% of the population. Those are patients with chronic diseases, people with metastatic cancer, babies born prematurely and others, he said.
“In some ways that makes it easier to address because you’re talking about a smaller set of the population, but I think it actually makes it much harder to address because these are people who very much need care, and we want them to have the best care that’s available,” he said. “So how do you make that less expensive? That is the conundrum that we face in American health care.”
It’s important to make sure healthy people are covered by insurance, which was the point of the ACA mandate that required everyone to have insurance, All said. That mandate was struck down but the ACA covers about one in every six people under age 65, or about 44 million people, according to KFF, which tracks health policies. 
“If you only cover people who have the costliest care then, then they won’t be able to afford it at all. None of us could,” he said. 
All said it’s frustrating to hear people against ACA subsidies say that “most people don’t use the care anyway.”
“You would never have auto insurance, for example, where only people who get into wrecks pay their auto premium,” he said.
All said smaller towns, in particular, could be in jeopardy of losing access to local health care services with Medicaid cuts and the possibility of ACA subsidies not being renewed.
Many Kansas hospitals are in difficult financial condition with rising costs. The Kansas Hospital Association said non-reimbursed care costs continue to rise for community hospitals. In 2023, the amount was over $26 billion, and since 2015 non-reimbursed care has increased by 77%.
All said insurance companies have a responsibility to be stewards of the health care industry and work to make sure care is affordable and available.
“I think there’s a lot of criticism that’s fair of the insurance industry, but it’s not really the reason why health care costs keep going up,” All said. “It is really because we have decided that we’re going to have a system that is really rich for some people and not so rich for others and unavailable for others. Until we make a real commitment to universal coverage that’s affordable, we’re going to be in this fix.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/TUKHS-St.-Francis-Campus-Entrance-A--1024x676.jpg,,,2025-12-01 11:58:54.878487

“Action must be taken immediately to protect consumers, combat illegal monopolies and ensure these corporations are not criminally profiting at the expense of the American people,” Trump said in a social media post.
On Nov. 7, the White House published four claims in support of the investigation. Investigate Midwest fact-checked those claims.
Claim: The Trump administration stated, “The ‘Big Four’ meat packers — JBS (Brazil), Cargill, Tyson Foods, and National Beef — currently dominate 85% of the U.S. beef processing market, up from just 36% in 1980.”
True. These four companies (Marfrig owns National Beef) control roughly 85% of the U.S. beef industry, including owning more than 70 meat brands like Hillshire Farm, Swift, Honeysuckle and Jimmy Dean, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Claim: In calling for a DOJ investigation, the Trump administration said: “For too long, a handful of giant meat packers have squeezed America’s cattle producers, shrunk herds, and jacked up prices at the grocery store.”
Partly true. There is evidence that the consolidation of meatpackers has led to a decrease in the price ranchers are paid for their cattle.
However, a USDA study found that consolidation contributed to lower production costs, which in turn led to lower costs at the grocery store.
“Lower production costs did translate into lower consumer prices, increased consumption, and higher prices for cattle and hogs,” according to a 2024 USDA report. “However, with fewer rivals because of increased concentration, most of the studies found packers were also able to exercise some market power and pay lower prices for cattle than they would have had they faced more competitors.”
It is true that beef prices have increased for consumers in recent years, and the margin between cattle prices and retail prices has widened (indicating packer margins have grown). But many economic observers note that price increases at the grocery store have been mostly influenced by factors such as labor, transportation and input costs.
Claim: The Trump administration said, “Industry consolidation has crushed competition and hammered cattle producers.”
True. Since the 1970s, the nation’s cattle supply has become increasingly consolidated by larger meatpacking companies. An often cited USDA report from 2000 first highlighted the rate of “four-firm control,” or the measure of the beef industry’s outputs controlled by its four largest producers, which was 25% in 1971.
By 1992, the rate had jumped to 71%, and today it hovers around 85%.
Large plants across the country account for the majority of all slaughter. Just 12 federally inspected plants produced slightly less than half of the country’s beef supply as of 2022, according to an Investigate Midwest data analysis.
The nation’s cattle ranchers have faced increased consolidation in modern times, leaving them with few options when selling their herds to slaughter, often only able to accept a single large meatpacker as their buyer in their region.
Claim: Finally, the Trump administration claimed that the monopolization of the meatpacking industry has led to the exploitation of American consumers, farmers, and ranchers.” The administration went on to state: “In fact, mounting evidence shows this monopoly power has slashed payments to ranchers, reduced herd sizes, driven up consumer prices, and threatened America’s food supply chain.”
Partly true. American consumers have seen increased costs in numerous pantry staples in recent years. This increase can be attributed to rising inflation, COVID-19 supply chain disruptions, disease outbreaks and price-gouging.
Monopoly power in meatpacking isn’t the sole cause of the nation’s historic low cattle inventory. This low can also be attributed to climate-change-fueled droughts disrupting cattle feed and replacement cycles in the industry.
Consolidated power in the meat industry has disrupted the nation’s food supply in recent years.
A cyberattack on U.S. JBS plants in May 2021 resulted in ripple effects of delayed production. A 2019 fire at a Tyson slaughter plant in Kansas resulted in a 27% drop in cattle traded on the market during the following week, as the plant remained closed, according to a USDA incident report.
A disruption at these pivotal points in the food supply, no matter the cause, has a cascading effect on the entire food supply chain, from ranchers to consumers.

(Niki Kelly/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana House Republicans released Monday a proposed redrawing of the state’s congressional maps aimed at producing a 9-0 Republican U.S. House delegation.
The proposed map splits strongly Democratic Indianapolis among four districts that all stretch far into rural, heavily Republican counties.
The map obliterates the current 7th District now held by Democratic Rep. André Carson. The new 7th District would span from the north side of Indianapolis to counties along the Ohio River near Cincinnati.

The Lake Michigan shoreline area that now makes up the 1st District held by Democratic Rep. Frank Mrvan also is split up. Republicans propose a new 1st District taking in Democratic-friendly Lake County then heading southeast to take in the areas around the small cities of Logansport, Peru and Wabash.
Indiana House members are scheduled to meet Monday afternoon to start the process of considering the congressional redistricting that President Donald Trump has been demanding for months to improve the chances of Republicans keeping their slim majority in the U.S. House.
House Republicans will announce today who will carry the bill as well as information on public hearings. In 2021, lawmakers held 14 hearings around the state and in Indianapolis.
The state Senate, where several Republican senators have expressed opposition to the redistricting, is expected to meet next week.
Trump won each of the districts under the proposed map by at least 12 percentage points in the 2024 election, according to an analysis by Indianapolis City-County Councilor Nick Roberts, a Democrat.
Trump’s narrowest win was in the proposed 1st District, where Republican Gov. Mike Braun won by a 6 percentage point margin, according to Roberts.

Developers’ efforts to overturn the cancellation of a vast gold and copper mine planned for southwest Alaska are getting a boost from national mining and pro-business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
On Nov. 24 and Nov. 25, the Chamber and the National Mining Association filed separate friend-of-the-court briefs in the lawsuit brought by the developers of the proposed Pebble Mine against the Environmental Protection Agency, which vetoed the mine.
Neither group has intervened in the case against the EPA, but the briefs represent the groups’ support for the proposed mine and offer legal arguments that Judge Sharon Gleason could consider as she debates whether to move the project forward.
In 2023, the EPA invoked a rarely used “veto” clause of the Clean Water Act to say that there was no way that the proposed Pebble Mine could be developed without significant harm to the environment. The large mineral deposit is located at the headwaters of Bristol Bay, the most abundant sockeye salmon fishery in the world.
The administration of Gov. Mike Dunleavy, which supports the project, and the proposed mine’s developers, filed separate lawsuits in federal court to overturn the rejection, as did two Native corporations that work as contractors for the developers. Those cases have since been combined.
The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case directly, which has left the issue in front of Judge Sharon Gleason in the U.S. District Court for the District of Alaska.
Another lawsuit filed by the state claims that if the veto is upheld, the federal government will owe Alaska $700 billion, the state’s estimate for the value of the mine if built as planned. That case has been put on hold until the District Court rules.
In July, the administration of President Donald Trump indicated that it might try to settle the suit and withdraw the veto. If that occurs, it could come before Jan. 2, when the EPA is slated to file a written response to the plaintiffs’ motions for summary judgment. 
If the EPA continues to fight the case, the last written arguments are scheduled to be finished by the end of February. Any oral argument would take place afterward.
If the federal government drops the case, it doesn’t mean a free path for Pebble: Several environmental organizations, fishing groups, tribal organizations and Bristol Bay locals have also intervened in the case and intend to fight in court. 
The Alaska Legislature is also expected to consider a bill that would block both Pebble and any successor projects that might emerge.
In its brief, the National Mining Association — joined by the American Exploration and Mining Association and the Alaska Miners Association — call the EPA’s veto “overly broad” and say that if it is upheld, the act “will almost certainly chill investment in domestic mining activities” because other proposed mines could also be subject to a veto.
The Chamber of Commerce, which has backed the Pebble Mine project since at least 2022, said that if the veto is upheld, it has the potential of encouraging other vetoes, which would “disrupt important industries in which many of the Chamber’s members participate.”

Sensory exercises like this are often used in special education classrooms. (Getty Images)TOPEKA — An autism spectrum diagnosis can be confounding for some families.
For years, parents and caregivers had little support or guidance to provide the best outcomes for children with autism.
Often, the most they were given was a packet of information, said Linda Heitzman-Powell, a professor in pediatrics for the University of Kansas and a lead researcher for an autism training program.
“It always felt like that we were setting them adrift at sea with no sail and no oars,” Heitzman-Powell said on the Kansas Reflector podcast.


But roughly 25 years ago, Heitzman-Powell and a small handful of doctors began training service providers in how to foster a stable family when a child has an autism spectrum diagnosis.
Parents expressed interest in the training, so Heitzman-Powell, with federal grant funding, created a parent-focused program through the University of Kansas Medical Center and studied its efficacy. The program is called OASIS, or Online and Applied Systems of Intervention Skills.
“It’s teaching parents the fundamental skills or procedures or practices that are inherent in an evidence-based approach, so they can take it with them in life, whether it be to grandma’s house, whether it be, you know, going trick-or-treating, whether it be going to get their hair cut or going out to eat,” said Heitzman-Powell, who was not speaking on behalf of the KU Medical Center. “I just think it’s important that parents are empowered.”
A recent federal funding award has allowed the program to expand further and develop a Spanish-language ambassador framework. The program previously included bilingual resources and cultural accommodations, Heitzman-Powell said, but the funding allows researchers to go deeper.
That means considering how Hispanic and Latino families obtain information, who families will trust and listen to and how to provide further support.
“Our impetus was families,” Heitzman-Powell said. “It always has been. It’s identifying a need of families in the field and then trying to develop programs that can address that, and then diligently working to get that program back out into the field.”
The program’s ultimate purpose is to develop evidence-based strategies that can be easily incorporated into everyday life, she said.
Part of the purpose, too, is advocacy.
In Heitzman-Powell’s work, the need to correct misperceptions began with debunked theories. One was dubbed “refrigerator moms,” an untrue claim that emotionally cold mothers cause autism in children. Another theorized that a gluten- and casein-free diet could prevent autism, which has not been backed by science.
Correlation is not causation, Heitzman-Powell said.
She has run into similar rhetoric in unsubstantiated claims that certain vaccines cause autism, including directly from the current top U.S. health official.
Autism encompasses a wide range of different behavioral, intellectual, developmental and emotional and mental health symptoms.
New fads always arise, Heitzman-Powell said, including ones that tout purported cures to autism. There are none, but autism is treatable.
“The cure that we know works is a lot of hard work,” Heitzman-Powell said. “And it’s being able to break all those behaviors down into their incremental pieces and systematically teaching them and putting them back together until you come up with this really wonderful, warm, kind, caring, beautiful, little individual that has the ability to be as independent as possible.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/gettyimages-1088179758-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-01 09:56:14.320393
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-01 14:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Here’s why everyone’s talking about a ‘K-shaped’ economy,Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/01/what-is-the-k-shaped-economy/,A big reason the term is popping up so often is that it helps explain an unusually muddy and convoluted period for the U.S. economy.,"WASHINGTON (AP) — From corporate executives to Wall Street analysts to Federal Reserve officials, references to the “K-shaped economy” are rapidly proliferating.
So what does it mean? Simply put, the upper part of the K refers to higher-income Americans seeing their incomes and wealth rise while the bottom part points to lower-income households struggling with weaker income gains and steep prices.
A big reason the term is popping up so often is that it helps explain an unusually muddy and convoluted period for the U.S. economy. Growth appears solid, yet hiring is sluggish and the unemployment rate has ticked up. Overall consumer spending is still rising, but Americans are less confident. AI-related data center construction is soaring while factories are laying off workers and home sales are weak. And the stock market still hovers near record highs even as wage growth is slowing.
It also captures ongoing concerns around affordability, which is much more of a concern for middle and lower-income households. Persistent inflation has received renewed political attention after voter anger over costly rents, groceries, and imported goods helped Democrats win several high-profile elections last month.
“Those at the bottom are living with the cumulative impacts of price inflation,” said Peter Atwater, an economics professor at William & Mary in Virginia. “At the same time, those at the top are benefiting from the cumulative impact of asset inflation.”
Here are some things to know about the K-shaped economy:
Not an L, U or V
Atwater actually popularized the label “K-shaped economy” during the pandemic after seeing it crop up on social media. Other economists were discussing different letters to describe how the COVID recession in 2020 could play out: Would it be a V-shaped recovery, meaning a sharp decline and then rapid bounce-back? Or would it be U-shaped, meaning a more gradual rebound? Or, worse, L-shaped: A recession followed by extended stagnation.
“There was sort of this land-grab for letters,” Atwater said. “To me the letter that made the most sense was K.”
Back then, it captured the differing fortunes between white-collar professionals still employed and working at home while stock prices rose, even as massive layoffs at factories, restaurants, and entertainment venues pushed unemployment to nearly 15%.
Inequality persists
Inequality was somewhat reversed in the aftermath of the pandemic, when businesses offered large raises for blue collar workers as the economy reopened and demand surged. Many companies — restaurants, hotels, entertainment venues — were caught short-staffed and sought to rapidly increase hiring. Lower-income workers saw larger pay gains than higher-paid ones.
In 2023 and 2024, inflation-adjusted wages for the bottom quarter of workers rose at a yearly rate of 3.9%, outpacing the 3.1% gains for the top quarter, according to research by the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.
“We had that kind of two-year period where the bottom was catching up and that talk of the K-shape went away,” Dario Perkins, an economist at TSLombard, said. “And since then, the economy’s cooled down again,” he added, bringing back K-shape references.
This year, however, inflation-adjusted wage growth has weakened as hiring has fallen, with the drop more pronounced for lower-income Americans. Their wage growth has plunged to an annual rate of just 1.5%, the Minneapolis Fed found, below that of the highest earning quarter of workers at 2.4%.
Slower income growth has left many lower-income workers less able to spend. Based on data from its credit card and debit card customers, Bank of America found that spending among higher-income households rose 2.7% in October compared with a year ago, while lower-income groups lagged at just 0.7%.
And a Federal Reserve Bank of Boston study in August found that consumer spending in recent years has been driven by richer households, while lower- and middle-income Americans have piled up more credit card debt even as they’ve spent less.
Businesses take note
Corporate executives are paying attention and in some cases explicitly adjusting their businesses to account for it. They are seeking ways to sell more high-priced items to the wealthy while also reducing package sizes and taking other steps to target struggling consumers.
Henrique Braun, chief operating officer at Coca-Cola, for example, said in late October that the company is pursuing both “affordability” and “premiumization.” It is generating more of its earnings from higher-end products such as its Smartwater and Fairlife filtered milk brands, while at the same time introducing mini cans for those looking to spend less.
“We continue to see divergency in spending between the income groups,” Braun said in a conference call with analysts last month. “The pressure on middle and low-end income consumers is still there.”
Sales of first- and business-class tickets have been fueling revenue and profit for Delta Air Lines, its CEO Ed Bastian said in October, while lower-end consumers have been “clearly struggling.”
And Best Buy CEO Corie Barry on Tuesday said that the top 40% of all U.S. consumers are driving two-thirds of all consumption.
The remaining 60% are focused on getting the best deals and are more dependent on a healthy job market, she said.
“One of the things we’re watching closely is how does employment continue to evolve for particularly that cohort of people who are living more paycheck to paycheck,” she added.
AI plays a role
The massive investment in data centers and computing power has also contributed to the K-shaped economy, by lifting share prices for the so-called “Magnificent 7” companies competing to build out AI Infrastructure. Yet so far it’s not creating many jobs or lifting incomes for those who don’t own stocks.
“What we see at the very top is an economy that is sort of self-contained … between AI, the stock market, the experiences of the wealthy,” Atwater said. “And it’s largely contained. It doesn’t flow through to the bottom.”
Driven by big gains for companies like Google, Amazon, Nvidia, and Microsoft, the stock market has risen nearly 15% this year. But the wealthiest 10% of Americans own roughly 87% of the stock market, according to Federal Reserve data. The poorest 50% own just 1.1%.
K-shape comes with concerns
Many economists worry that an economy propelled mostly by the wealthiest isn’t sustainable. Perkins notes that should layoffs worsen and unemployment rise, middle- and lower-income Americans could pull back sharply on spending. Revenue for companies like Apple and Amazon would fall. Advertising revenue, which is fueling companies such as Google and Facebook parent Meta, typically plunges in downturns.
Such a cycle could even force the “Mag 7” to pull back on their AI investments and send the economy into recession, he said.
“Then you’re talking about the bottom of the K essentially pulling down the top,” he added.
Perkins, however, sees a different path as more likely: Many U.S. households will receive larger tax refunds early next year under the Trump administration’s budget law. And Trump will likely appoint a new Federal Reserve chair by next May who will be more inclined to cut interest rates. Lower borrowing costs could accelerate growth and wages, though it could also worsen inflation.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25330618688087-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-01 14:57:13.655869

Chris looks back at the end of year lawmaking hustle, and what was left for 2026, then turns to a possibly record-smashing number of ballot questions that could land before voters next November.","EPISODE INFO

HOST: Jennifer Smith
GUEST: Chris Lisinski







AS LAWMAKERS MADE a final push last month at the end of formal sessions for the year, the state’s real political energy wasn’t centered under the Golden Dome. It was in supermarket parking lots and coffee shops where signature gatherers made a final dash to gather the required support to place ballot questions before voters next year. A potential record number of 2026 ballot measures have cleared that significant hurdle, setting the stage for a second half of the two-year legislative session consumed by outside pressure for policy change. 
CommonWealth Beacon reporters Jennifer Smith and Chris Lisinski dug into the dawning ballot season and reviewed the end-of-session scramble on The Codcast.  
Voters could see as many as a dozen ballot questions at the polls next November. Ballot referendums – inherently blunt instruments – are tools to prod lawmakers to take action as much as efforts to create law themselves. And several take aim at the state’s notoriously opaque and uncompetitive political system. 
Ballot efforts to subject the governor’s office, the House, and the Senate to public records laws and rein in legislative stipends are successor referendums of a sort, after last cycle’s successful initiative authorizing the state auditor to audit the Legislature, which has stalled. “Thematically, all of this falls under the exact same umbrella that has long been hoisted,” Lisinski noted, “criticizing Massachusetts as one of the least transparent state legislatures in the country.”  
Both legislative chambers okayed bills to retool the embattled Cannabis Control Commission. 
“Legislative leaders have tried to downplay the degree to which the controversies at the commission, specifically between chair Shannon O’Brien and Treasurer Deb Goldberg, prompted this legislation,” Lisinski said. “They’ve really pitched the bill as just a necessary update, so many years into this industry, to buff out some rough areas that practice has shown don’t work as well as needed. That being said, we’re all free and independent thinkers, and we can connect the dots that this significant industry overhaul has only started to move now after a very long series of controversies.” 
Meanwhile, a ballot measure that could come before voters next November seeks to recriminalize recreational cannabis just a decade after voters took to the ballot box to legalize it. 
The ballot question would roll back the clock to before the 2016 ballot measure that legalized recreational use of marijuana. While proponents say they have submitted enough signatures to clear the first hurdle – not without controversy – Bay State voters have not signaled a broad appetite to undo the earlier measure. A 2024 poll on cannabis policy from the MassINC Polling Group, which is partially owned by CommonWealth Beacon’s publisher MassINC, found 65 percent of respondents said legalizing marijuana in the state was “the right decision.” 
November 19 marked the end of this year’s formal sessions under internal legislative rules. Major bills that didn’t reach the governor are likely on hold until 2026. But Massachusetts lawmaking is famously backloaded—most major action happens in the final weeks of the second year, not the first. 
As lawmakers downshift into informal sessions for the remainder of 2025, the Legislature cleared a $2 billion closeout budget last month for fiscal 2025. Beyond MassHealth funding and money for sheriffs and World Cup tourism, the bill imposed new oversight on sheriff spending and decoupled state vaccine schedules from federal recommendations – a preemptive move against potential changes under vaccine-wary Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. 
The House punted on its energy bill after attempting to rewrite Gov. Maura Healey’s affordability proposal to weaken the state’s 2030 decarbonization targets. Budget chief Aaron Michlewitz pulled it after strong blowback.

Paid leave grants Minnesota workers up to 12 weeks of family leave and 12 weeks of medical leave per year, capped at 20 weeks in a single year. Employers and workers will pay into a fund through a payroll tax, and wages are determined by a wage-based formula — the maximum a person on leave can receive is $1,423 per week.
Most people will start to see a payroll tax deduction in their paychecks beginning in January. The rate for the first year is 0.88%, which will be split between employers and their employees. Most workers will pay half, or 44 cents for every $100 in taxable wages.
Minnesota is planning to open up applications for baby bonding leave prior to the Jan. 1 launch date to allow parents to get their paid leave applications in early. The Department of Employment and Economic Development said applications will open in early December.
Paid leave is a big — and sometimes confusing — state program. Here are some common questions about it.
Who qualifies?
Nearly every employer and worker.
Full-time, part-time, seasonal and temporary workers all qualify. People with multiple jobs can also take leave from one or more of their employers.
Federal employees, postal workers, and self-employed and independent contractors aren’t covered by default; all but federal workers can choose to opt into the plan.
If your employer offers a paid leave program that is the same or more generous than the state’s, then there’s a chance you won’t have access to the state’s paid leave, but in that case you won’t have to pay the tax. Ask your employer if you are covered by the paid leave program.
If someone works in more than one state, they can receive paid leave if they work at least 50% of the time in Minnesota. This includes people that work from home.
I had a child in 2025: Can I take leave in 2026?
Parents who welcomed a child into their home in 2025 will be able to claim paid leave benefits in 2026, even if they’ve already taken leave through their employer. These parents can qualify for up to 12 weeks of paid leave as long as their application is approved within one year of welcoming a child, including a new baby, adoption and foster placement.
I’m pregnant. How do I get paid leave next year?
Plan when you want to use paid leave in 2026. You can take up to 12 weeks of family leave to bond with your newborn child, adopted child or foster placement. You can also take up to 12 weeks of medical leave to recover from serious health events, including childbirth.
If you take both family and medical leave in a single year, you can take up to 20 weeks total of paid leave.
You must notify your employer at least 30 days before your leave. Talk to your employer about other leaves and payments you could take. For example, some employers will allow their workers to use their accumulated paid time off to “top off” the payments you receive from the state so you receive your normal wages while on leave.
Your employer will be notified that you have submitted an application to take paid leave.
Applications require certification from a health care provider. Work with your provider to obtain a PDF of a qualifying document that you can attach to your paid leave application.
For bonding leave, you can use a birth certificate, hospital discharge document or adoption or foster placement paperwork.
The state is working to update the application process so you don’t have to get documentation directly from your provider, but it will not be ready by initial launch.
Do I have to take my leave all at once?
No.
I need surgery and time to recover. How do I get paid leave?
You can take up to 12 weeks of medical leave to recover from an illness or injury.
You can take leave if you have a qualifying event that lasts at least seven days, but the days don’t need to be consecutive. For example, if you need to attend regular medical appointments that total seven days, you can get payments for the days you are on leave from work.
On a similar note, your leave doesn’t need to be taken all at once. For example, if you feel well enough to return to work but experience flare-ups of pain, you can take the leave only when you need it. You won’t receive wages for the entire week, just the days you were on leave.
For intermittent medical leave — like pain flare-ups — you will need to work with your health care provider and employer to get approval to take off specific days.
If the leave is unplanned, let your employer know as soon as you can and fill out your paid leave application.
Applications for medical leave must include certification from your health care provider. You will need to work with your health care provider to obtain a form that you can attach to your application.
As with leave for babies, the state is working to update the application process so applicants do not have to get documentation directly from their providers, but it will not be ready by initial launch.
Workers can also take up to 12 weeks to care for a family member with a health condition. The family member doesn’t need to be located in Minnesota, but their health care provider is required to certify that that worker is the designated caretaker. “Family member” is widely defined.
It includes immediate family — including spouses — grandchildren or grandparents, sons- or daughters-in-law and any person “who has a personal relationship with the applicant that creates an expectation and reliance for care,” according to the state.
How much will I be paid? 
Minnesota’s paid leave is intended as a partial wage replacement, so you won’t get your full pay.
To receive the payments, you need to have made least $3,900 in the past year. This can be from multiple jobs. The payments are based on your average weekly wage.
For weekly wages between zero and $711.50, you will get paid 90% of these wages.
For everything you make between $711.50 and $1,423, you will get paid 66% of these weekly wages.
For everything above $1,423, you will get paid 55% of these weekly wages.
It works like marginal tax rates.
So, for instance, if you make $1,500 per week, you’ll receive:

90% of $711.50, or $640; 
plus 66% of the next $711.50 or $470; 
plus 55% of the final $77, or $42. 

Add them up, and you get about $1,152.
Your weekly payment cannot exceed $1,423. You can estimate your payment by using the state’s tool.
How much will I be taxed?
Payroll tax deductions for nearly all workers begin in January. The rate for the first year is 0.88%, which will be split between employers and their employees. Most employees will pay half, or 44 cents for every $100 in taxable wages.
Employers can choose to pay more than their required share.
A payroll tax cannot cause an employee to earn less than minimum wage, so employers may have to assume more of the payroll tax.
Minnesota’s paid leave program will have an income ceiling, above which people won’t be taxed. Minnesotans will not be taxed on income above $184,000.
The state will evaluate the solvency of the paid leave program and set a payroll tax rate each year. This means the tax could be higher than 0.88% in the future, though officials cannot raise it above 1.1%, according to state law.
You can estimate your paid leave tax with the state’s premium calculator.
How does paid leave work for small businesses?
Businesses that employ 30 or fewer people and have an average employee wage under 150% of the state average pay — $1423 — will be required to participate in the paid leave program. Like other businesses, they can be excluded if they offer a paid leave program that is the same or more generous than the state’s.
Small businesses will pay a reduced payroll tax of 0.66%. An employer must pay at least 0.22%, while an employee can only pay up to 0.44%.
Minnesota lawmakers created a Small Employer Assistance Grant program, which subsidizes small businesses that have trouble when an employee takes leave. The grants can help with the hiring of temporary workers or for training new staff while an employee is out on leave.
Grants will be up to $3,000 per leave or $6,000 per employer.
What will the state do to prevent fraud in the program?
Fraudsters in recent years have bilked hundreds of millions from Minnesota’s public programs, and state officials are working to ensure paid leave doesn’t become another, they say.
Minnesota will implement a new login system — LoginMN — that will require paid leave applicants to create an account, upload a picture of their driver’s license and take a real-time selfie. This is to help prevent artificial intelligence programs from creating accounts to apply for paid leave.
The application process requires several verification steps by the employer, worker, health provider and the state. Employers are able to review their workers’ leave application and flag inconsistencies.
All applications for leave require certification from a health care provider, and the provider must sign off on the duration of leave. For intermittent leave, the provider must sign off on the duration for each time period.
State officials will use data analytics to help catch anomalies. The state officials say they will refer cases for criminal prosecution if they suspect fraud.
Every application will be reviewed, and the paid leave program will be randomly audited.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Throughout the winter, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources will monitor applications of an approved herbicide, in very low doses, to the water at Clear Lake to eradicate invasive plant species. 
Eurasian watermilfoil and curly-leaf pondweed are non-native plants that are easily spread to wetlands and other lakes.  The plants can also impact recreation on the lake. 
Scott Grummer, a fisheries management biologist at Clear Lake with DNR said the herbicide, Sonar A.S., will only impact the non-native plant species because it is being applied during a season when native aquatic plants have already died back.

Grummer said DNR went out in a handful of boats in early November to spread the herbicide in strips through the center of the lake. He said they let “Mother Nature do that initial mixing” to spread the chemical throughout the water. 
The department is sampling and testing the lake water to keep herbicide concentrations at the recommended level of above 3 parts per billion, and to determine if additional “bumps” of the herbicide are needed. A bump, he said, will likely be applied in December, which might mean staff have to drill holes into an iced-over lake.
While it’s unlikely many Iowans are slipping into their water skis this time of year, Grummer said the herbicide is applied in such a low dose that there are no water use restrictions in place at the lake. 
“Even if we were in the middle of summer, there’d be no swimming, boating, water use restrictions at all,” Grummer said.
Fishing and irrigation are also still OK on Clear Lake during the treatment period, which is expected to continue until the middle of January. 
Grummer said the herbicide is very “slow acting” so the “true evidence of success” for the treatment won’t be known until the department conducts a vegetation survey in 2026. 
The herbicide starves the plants over a number of weeks by preventing it from producing a pigment necessary for photosynthesis. 
Grummer said the treatment has been successful at a number of other Iowa lakes, including Crystal Lake, East Okoboji and Lake Cornelia. 
“We’ve done enough of them, we know what works,” Grummer said. “As long as we can hold that concentration, we’ve been successful in other systems at eradicating this Eurasian watermilfoil, and that’s the goal with this project.” 
Grummer said this project took about a year to plan and is funded by DNR’s lake restoration program and support from local partners. 
Eurasian watermilfoil grows at deep depths, as tall as 12 to 15 feet, which Grummer said can be a nuisance to water recreation. 
The plant spreads via fragmentation. Like an easy-to-propagate houseplant, a small segment and some water is enough to grow roots and spread. 
“All you need is a little piece to get a population started,” Grummer said. 
This factor means it’s especially important for boaters and anglers to follow good boat hygiene practices. Grummer said the basics, regardless of if a known invasive species is present or not, are to clean, drain and dry before transporting anything from a lake or river.
“We probably have boaters come from all over Iowa (to Clear Lake) and it’s just a really needed project, just to kind of cut off these invasives the best we can,” Grummer said.

The Missouri Department of Corrections recorded his death as an accident and offered few additional details. His family requested records from the prison’s investigation into his death, documents such as the internal investigative report that might paint a fuller picture of Lancaster’s last moments. But their requests for more information were “largely ignored,” according to their lawyer, Joe Allen.
It wasn’t until they reached out to the county coroner who handled Lancaster’s body that his family learned the 39-year-old had been in a restrictive housing unit for over two weeks when he died from a fentanyl overdose.
In March, Lancaster’s mother, Mary Harris, filed a wrongful death suit against the prison system. The coroner’s records, including a death certificate ruling Lancaster’s death a homicide, provided the basis for Harris’ lawsuit alleging that prison officials failed to properly care for her son.  
“Alan was in solitary confinement and somehow dies of a fentanyl overdose,” Allen said. “How do you get fentanyl while you’re in solitary confinement?”

When someone dies in a Missouri prison, the prison system is required to provide certain information to families about the death. Staff should notify emergency contacts of the death and explain how to access the deceased’s medical records, according to the Missouri DOC’s communications director. For more information, families or their attorneys can submit records requests. State law dictates that even if certain records are normally closed, the DOC should provide families access to those documents “for purposes of investigation.”
But families of people who died in prison and their attorneys told The Marshall Project – St. Louis that the DOC doesn’t always follow its own policies. Left with unanswered questions about how their loved ones died, some have instead turned to the coroner. 
While coroners are elected officials generally responsible for investigating violent or unexpected deaths in their county, Missouri’s statute requires coroners to “fully investigate the essential facts” surrounding every death in custody, regardless of how it happened. The information from their investigations can help families find a sense of closure — and when deaths are suspected to be the result of abuse or neglect, a coroner’s investigation can also play a role in holding the prison system accountable. 
Unlike states such as New York that have medical boards to review deaths behind bars and mandate policy changes, coroners provide the only guarantee of outside scrutiny when someone dies in a Missouri prison. And although people who die in custody each year are particularly vulnerable to disappearing from public record, the statutes governing exactly how coroners conduct their investigations contain almost no record-keeping requirements. 
Historically, these policies have granted coroners wide discretion in how thoroughly to investigate, resulting in an uneven standard of prison death investigations across the state. 
Now, in Missouri and across the country, a coalition of forensic scientists, public health researchers and legal experts is pushing for more robust policy and oversight to hold every prison death investigator to the same high bar. 

“The coroner really is, in many places, the only opportunity for outside review or oversight,” said Dr. Roger Mitchell, president of the National Medical Association and co-author of the book “Death in Custody.” “So states need to take control over their death investigation apparatus, ensuring that there’s uniformity.”
When Tanekka Guest’s husband, Christopher, died at South Central prison in October 2023, she struggled to learn the truth about his death from prison officials. All the warden told her when he broke the news was that her husband died in his sleep, Guest said. 
“I was like, ‘How? What happened?’” she recalled. “The warden just said, ‘I’ll let you know more information when we get it.’”
Guest said she called the prison nearly every day for a month to speak to the warden, but he was never available. Eventually, she spoke to an investigator, who told her she would receive a flash drive with the contents of her husband’s tablet. Neither the flash drive nor the information she was promised ever came, she said. 
“They said they would let me know when they had the cause of death — they never did that, never told me any information,” she added. “It was just one pushback after another.” 
Details about her husband’s cause of death ultimately came from the county coroner, who called Guest to explain what happened: After a period of suicidal ideation, her husband overdosed on fentanyl and died. Guest said the biggest difference between her communication with the coroner and the prison was the follow-up. 
For weeks, Guest said she called the prison and never received any details. But every time she called the coroner, she got an answer. If she left a voicemail, it was promptly returned. 
“Talking to her was so comforting because she kept it 100% honest,” Guest said. “She said everything she could to put your heart and mind at ease.” 
Karen Pojmann, the DOC’s communications director, said the prison system “doesn’t withhold death information from families.” Autopsy reports, conducted by the medical examiner, are available to anyone who requests them, she said. Reports from the department’s internal death investigations are technically open to the public, but Pojmann said they can be closed or heavily redacted “for a variety of reasons, including … sensitive information that could compromise the security of the facility.” 
Although no agency or department keeps an official count, there are numerous reported instances of families filing lawsuits in recent years against the Missouri Department of Corrections to try to get information about the deceased’s final moments in prison. Families in Missouri describe being repeatedly stonewalled by prison officials. 
In one instance, an appeals court ordered the DOC to pay a mother over $60,000 in penalties and court fees for failing to provide video footage and the prison’s internal investigation of her son’s suicide in 2021. In another case, a court ordered the DOC to pay $5,000 after ruling that officials “knowingly and purposefully violated” public records law by refusing to provide video and other investigative records to another woman whose son was beaten to death in prison that same year. 
“They don’t hear back from the Department of Corrections, or they’ll deny a lot of records requests,” said Lori Curry, executive director of the advocacy group Missouri Prison Reform, of families’ experiences with the prison system. “It can really break your spirit to try to find out the truth about something and continually run into brick walls.”
The coroner’s independence from the prison system can mean they are emboldened to be direct and honest with families about how someone died, death in custody researchers noted. Coroners have the ability to freely hand over information like autopsy reports and death certificates. By contrast, limited oversight and the risk of being held legally liable for a death behind bars creates an incentive for prison officials to either cover up or misattribute causes of death.
After Christopher Scroggins died at South Central in June 2022 at the age of 23, the Department of Corrections listed his manner of death as “unknown.” But when an attorney representing the family requested the coroner’s records, he learned that Scroggins’ death was actually due to a fentanyl overdose. 
The attorney, Geoff Meyercord, said he wasn’t afraid to sue the DOC for more details if necessary, despite facing what he described as considerable pushback and roadblocks. But protracted litigation, and having to relive the death again and again, can be a significant emotional burden for families, he said. Particularly for families who are just looking to answer basic questions about their loved one’s death, it’s often just easier to ask the coroner. 
“We always want to take the path of least resistance if we can,” he said.  
When families do choose to file a lawsuit against the prison for a wrongful or preventable death, experts say coroner records can be critical to building a case. In Lancaster’s case, the family’s repeated attempts to get records from prison officials or from the DOC went unanswered. “All the agencies have collectively failed and refused to comply with the law and produce the requested documents, conspiring to and engaging in a cover-up,” the complaint states, causing  the family “extreme mental and emotional pain, suffering and anguish.”
By contrast, the coroner’s report was provided without protest and offered crucial details, including that a corrections officer was reportedly “fired over the episode” two days after Lancaster died. 
“Lancaster was murdered while in the custody and care of MDOC,” the complaint alleges. “The Department of Corrections … abjectly failed in their duty of care to Lancaster, resulting in his preventable homicide.” 
The lawyer for Lancaster’s family noted he “ would not have made that specific statement without some supporting information.” 
 Improving record-keeping is especially valuable for deaths in custody, said Marie Lasater, the former Texas County coroner who investigated the deaths of both Lancaster and Guest. When a death occurs behind prison walls, families rarely see or even speak with their loved one in their last moments, and don’t have immediate access to the basic information they otherwise would about how the person died. 
If a death was preventable, prisons may make it difficult for families to ever find out, Lasater noted. For this reason, she added, incarcerated people need more of an investigation than a death in the free world.
“There’s a lot more possibility for a prison death to be reported [as] something other than what it was,” she said. 
After Howard County Coroner Trisha Clark moved back to Missouri from Florida just before the pandemic, she said she was shocked by some of her peers’ practices. 
Rather than coroners, Florida’s system for death investigations relies on medical examiners, who are required by statute to keep duplicate copies of records, including autopsy reports and lab investigations. Florida also has a guide to record-keeping, and a commission whose job it is to ​​ensure “uniform standards of excellence.” In Missouri, no such guardrails exist. 
Clark also works as a forensic investigator for Boone County, home to the minimum security Fulton Reception and Diagnostic Center, where five people died last year. She said many of Missouri’s newer coroners understand the importance of investigating prison deaths thoroughly and independently, rather than simply rubber-stamping the prison’s version of events. 
Still, it’s a challenge to get coroners in every county on board without some minimum standard of record-keeping. 
“You have coroners that literally have a pocket notebook where they’re writing a name and a date of birth,” she said. “These families are not getting a full, thorough investigation because [the coroner] is just like, ‘Oh well, whatever.’” 
Nationally, legal and medical researchers, as well as forensic scientists, are pushing to reform the investigative system for deaths in custody. The goal, they say, is to improve public understanding of how deaths happen and reduce the number of preventable deaths. In a recent report, the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine recommended that states require licensing for anyone performing prison death investigations, as well as an annual peer review for all coroner and medical examiner’s offices of at least 10% of their cases. 
The report also recommended the federal government update its death certificate template to include a checkbox for deaths in custody.
Experts say there are several simple measures Missouri could take to improve the investigative process for people who die in prison, starting with clarifying expectations. State policy instructs coroners to investigate, but doesn’t say much about what that investigation should look like. Coroners can choose to talk to witnesses, or not, and there is no requirement for digitization of records. 
Ensuring transparency around prison deaths would require the state to create new standards, noted Aaron Littman, co-lead of UCLA Law’s Behind Bars Data Project. Those standards might stipulate how quickly prison death investigations must be completed, what data must be collected from the prison, and how much of it must be public or made available to families.
State legislators could standardize record-keeping by mandating all coroners and medical examiners use the same software and reporting systems, experts added. (The former head of Missouri’s Coroners and Medical Examiners Association told The Marshall Project – St. Louis he’s in the early stages of proposing a bill to do just that.) Policymakers could also require the public health system to update the state’s death certificate form with a clear designation for in-custody deaths, researchers noted, so the public isn’t reliant entirely on the criminal justice system to track and report deaths. 
Missouri’s Department of Mental Health has a fatality review panel tasked with assessing “all suspicious deaths” of adults in the department’s custody; researchers pointed out that the state could create a similar panel for prison deaths.  
To grieving families, a coroner’s ability to be a resource in the face of an opaque prison system can mean not only accountability for their loved one’s death, but also closure. Coroners noted that improving the standard of reporting would offer all families an equal chance to understand what happened, eliminating the speculation and uncertainty that can exacerbate their grief and suffering.  
For weeks after her husband’s death, Tanekka Guest clung to a fading hope that prison officials would provide any information about Christopher’s final moments. She said the only detail the warden shared — that Christopher died in his sleep — left her with more doubt and questions: Was he alone? What could have killed him so suddenly? When she heard a rumor from another incarcerated person about foul play in her husband’s death, she said it nearly broke her.
After going weeks without answers, Guest said the coroner gave her the information she needed to properly grieve. At last, she said, she could rest.
“I couldn’t believe it at first,” Guest said. “But that’s how I was finally able to get closer to him: knowing what happened.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/rVhJ3wAA-1024x538.jpeg,,,2025-12-01 09:56:14.320393

En un caluroso día de verano, decenas de jornaleros hicieron una pausa en su trabajo de recolección de chiles en un campo remoto a 42 kilómetros de Fresno y acudieron a una clínica médica temporal. Era una oportunidad para recoger medicamentos y hacerse evaluaciones básicas de salud, como la presión arterial y el control de glucosa.
Durante casi una década, la Universidad de California en San Francisco (UCSF) ha estado desplegando clínicas móviles en el condado rural de Fresno para apoyar a una población de inmigrantes que de otro modo evitarían la atención médica.
 El programa cobró impulso durante la pandemia de COVID-19 y durante la década que California extendió la atención médica a los inmigrantes que se encuentran en el país sin autorización. Pero este año, los médicos están empezando a notar que los trabajadores no acuden a recibir atención como antes.
Los médicos creen que la disminución en la participación está relacionada con la agresiva aplicación de las leyes migratorias de la administración Trump. El Dr. Kenny Banh, director de la clínica móvil de salud de la UCSF, afirmó que las visitas de pacientes a sus unidades móviles rurales de salud comenzaron a disminuir a principios de año, cuando el presidente Donald Trump asumió su segundo mandato y prometió tomar medidas drásticas contra la inmigración ilegal.
“Hay mucha desconfianza. Vengo de la universidad y llevo una bata blanca; la gente está preocupada. Hacemos todo lo posible por explicarles cómo protegemos sus datos,” dijo Banh.

Según la UCSF, las visitas a sus clínicas móviles se redujeron en aproximadamente un 36% a medida que aumentaba las redadas migratorias en California. En 2024, las clínicas móviles atenderían un promedio de 34 pacientes por visita, pero en los últimos meses, la cantidad de pacientes se había reducido a aproximadamente 22. Las personas también están menos dispuestas a inscribirse en Medi-Cal , el programa estatal de seguro médico para hogares de bajos ingresos, por temor a compartir sus datos con el gobierno si no están autorizadas a permanecer en el país, explicó Banh.
Podría empeorar la situación.
California recortó la ley que permite a todos los residentes elegibles, independientemente de su estatus migratorio, recibir seguro médico a través de Medi-Cal al limitar temporalmente la inscripción el próximo año. Además, los condados se preparan para recortes a Medicaid bajo la ley presupuestaria que Trump firmó a principios de este año, la cual, según afirman, les dificultará mantener programas que atienden a poblaciones específicas, como el que brinda atención médica a los trabajadores agrícolas.
 “Va a ser más restrictivo en cuanto a requisitos laborales, reinscripciones más regulares y requisitos más estrictos para que los estados cumplan con los mandatos federales”, dijo Maria-Elena De Trinidad Young, profesora adjunta de salud pública en UC Merced. “Esto es una medida de presión. La política está diseñada para restringir el acceso a Medicaid, o como saben, en California lo llamamos Medi-Cal”.

 Llevando atención sanitaria a comunidades remotas
La clínica móvil que dirige Banh forma parte de una iniciativa más amplia del Departamento de Salud Pública de Fresno para reducir las enfermedades crónicas y transmisibles en las poblaciones que tienen dificultades al acceso médico. Recientemente, obtuvo financiación gracias a una ley de ayuda por la COVID-19 que el condado de Fresno destinó a las clínicas, dirigidas por la UCSF y el Centro Médico Saint Agnes.
 El dinero para el COVID-19 se está agotando, pero el programa tiene otro año de financiación asegurado.

Las clínicas de ambas organizaciones están presentes en eventos comunitarios, campañas de distribución de alimentos en comunidades rurales, escuelas y, a veces, en granjas. La clínica móvil de Santa Inés cuenta con dos salas de examen para la atención de los pacientes.

Según Ivonne Der Torosian, vicepresidenta de salud y bienestar comunitario del Centro Médico Saint Agnes, el programa está diseñado para brindarles a los estudiantes de medicina la oportunidad de servir a la comunidad y ampliar acceso a la atención médica.
 “Tenemos un contrato explícito para ir al condado rural de Fresno y atender a los trabajadores agrícolas, asociarnos con los empleadores de esos trabajadores agrícolas y también brindar servicios a sus familias”.

Los trabajadores de salud comunitarios también brindan educación sanitaria y hacen recomendaciones a proveedores de atención primaria cercanos para personas que no pueden recibir tratamientos en los centros médicos. 
 “Realizamos evaluaciones básicas, incluyendo atención primaria y preventiva, para muchas de las familias a las que atendemos. Buscamos conectarlas con proveedores de atención primaria”, dijo Der Torosiran. “Les proporcionamos vacunas, les monitorizamos la glucosa y revisamos sus niveles de hipertensión y presión arterial. Son servicios básicos que recibirían en un centro de atención primaria”.

La Dra. Navdeep Lehga, médica residente, comenzó recientemente un turno en la unidad médica de Saint Agnes en el Parque Rojas Pierce de Mendota, una comunidad agrícola a menos de una hora al oeste de Fresno. Una fila de personas la esperaba en la acera para recoger alimentos del centro de distribución y para verla a ella y a su equipo para un chequeo.

 A medida que avanzaba la mañana, Navdeep atendía a un paciente tras otro en la sala de exámenes de la clínica móvil o salía a ver a los pacientes en el estacionamiento, controlando la presión arterial con un medidor en los brazos de sus pacientes y los niveles de glucosa con pinchazos en los dedos.

Dijo que la mayoría de los pacientes que atiende son trabajadores agrícolas e inmigrantes. Gran parte de la población rural no tiene acceso a la atención médica; el hospital más cercano está a 56 kilómetros. Algunos de sus pacientes acuden a la unidad médica para recibir atención primaria porque no saben adónde ir.
“Por eso vienen aquí. Les contamos lo esencial de lo que está pasando. Pero tenemos suministros limitados y lo que podemos verificar,” dijo.
 Lehga afirma que la cantidad de personas que acuden a la camioneta ha disminuido desde que se intensificaron las medidas de control migratorio. Ha escuchado a pacientes hablar con el personal durante la sesión de admisión sobre sus temores de acudir a la camioneta y buscar atención médica después de un verano de intensas redadas migratorias.

 “Nos dimos cuenta de que antes venían muchos más pacientes, pero se asustaron y no querían venir porque no sabían quién vendría”, dijo Lehga. “Antes se sentían cómodos porque sabían que era seguro. Ahora creo que los pacientes, en general, tienen más miedo de venir simplemente porque no saben quién puede venir”.
 La Dra. Arianna Crediford, médica residente principal de Fresno St. Agnes Rural Mobile Health, dijo que las visitas a la camioneta han disminuido entre un 15 y un 20% este año.
 “Podemos especular que se debe a los problemas con la inmigración en este momento, que parecen tener una gran influencia en los trabajadores agrícolas y el envasado de alimentos”, dijo.
Crediford dijo que ha escuchado a algunos pacientes mencionar la preocupación de buscar atención médica y lo que eso podría implicar para ellos, pero han dejado en claro que no recopilan información de inmigración y que no necesitan hablar con ellos sobre ese tema en absoluto.

“La idea de que las personas tengan que tener miedo de recibir atención médica es desgarradora. Realmente pondría en riesgo sus condiciones de salud, condiciones que requieren seguimiento semanal, a veces mensual. Somos la última línea de defensa a la que pueden acudir, además de las salas de emergencia, cuando llegan con un evento que pone en peligro su vida. El día que esta población no pueda buscar atención médica de forma cómoda y segura, su salud estará en peligro por ello”, dijo Crediford.
La población, que a menudo no cuenta con seguro médico, padece de altas tasas de hipertensión, diabetes o hiperglucemia y colesterol alto, a menudo sin tratamiento, afirmó Banh. Con frecuencia, el equipo de salud rural es el único profesional de la salud que atiende a los pacientes.

Banh afirmó que, al haber menos pacientes que acuden a atención preventiva, las personas se  enfermarán más y terminarán recibiendo atención médica de urgencias. Esto cuesta más dinero y amenaza con colapsar el sistema de salud.
 “La gente no desaparece porque se cambie la política. Siguen necesitando atención.

For many migrant and immigrant farmworkers in California who do not have legal status, mobile medical clinics are their only access to health care. But as President Donald Trump’s administration continues its crackdown on immigrants, vulnerable farmworker patients are delaying care out of fears of deportation.
As CalMatters’ Larry Valenzuela explains in a visual essay, immigrant farmworkers are often uninsured and suffer from high rates of hypertension, diabetes and high cholesterol. The only health care providers this hard-to-reach population can access are often rural health teams that travel in pop-up medical clinics.
But since Trump’s aggressive immigration enforcement activity, UC San Francisco has reported a 36% drop in the number of visitors to its mobile clinics. Without preventative care, however, people will inevitably get sicker — which costs more money and can overwhelm the health system, said Dr. Kenny Banh, UCSF mobile health clinic director.

Banh: “People don’t disappear because you changed policy. They still need care. What you’re doing is delaying care until the outcomes are worse, and there’s not much you can do but hospitalize the patient.”

Dr. Arianna Crediford, chief resident physician with Fresno St. Agnes Rural Mobile Health, said visits to its van have dropped by as much as 20% this year. 

Crediford: “The idea that people have to be scared to receive health care is heartbreaking. … We’re the last line of defense that they’re able to go to besides emergency rooms when they come in with an actual life-threatening event.”

This is just one of a handful of other examples of decreasing health access for California immigrants who are in the country without authorization. After Trump’s budget bill passed in July, California counties are bracing for health cuts that they say will make it harder for them to continue programs serving distinct populations, such as rural farmworkers. In the latest state budget, California lawmakers also froze new Medi-Cal enrollment for immigrants without legal status.

Anxiety, distrust among CA’s international students

Federal policy changes related to student visas have driven down the number of new international students enrolling in U.S. colleges — a change that could have a major effect on California, which has the most international students, report Aliza Imran and Kahani Malhotra of CalMatters’ College Journalism Network.
The Trump administration earlier this year revoked thousands of student visas. Though most visas were reinstated by April following lawsuits, the experience caused anxiety and distrust among some international students CalMatters spoke to. Stricter federal policies regarding who can live and work in the U.S. from abroad are also exacerbating concerns. 
The number of new international students enrolling in American colleges and universities in the 2025-26 academic year declined by 17%, according to the Institute of International Education. Over 1.1 million international students studied in the U.S. during the last academic year and of those students, over 140,000, or 12.5%, studied in California. 
Not only do foreign students help drive scientific research and advancement in the U.S. — they also bring in money for California’s public universities. Scenario modeling from the Association of International Educators showed that a projected 15% decline in international student enrollment this academic year in California could result in the state losing more than $1 billion in revenue from the tuition and living expenses foreign students must pay.

Young CA Dems eyeing Congress

The Democratic Party is facing intra-party clashes in California as younger challengers seek to unseat longtime Democratic incumbents in the U.S. House of Representatives, following significant election losses during last year’s presidential race, writes CalMatters’ Maya C. Miller.
A crop of young candidates in three of California’s deep blue districts are arguing that the Democratic party needs to offer voters candidates who have bold new ideas and can energize the party’s base — instead of aging incumbents entrenched in Washington’s insider culture.
In Sacramento, City Councilmember Mai Vang, 40, is running against 10-term Rep. Doris Matsui, 81. Vang told CalMatters that “status quo politics isn’t going to protect our communities,” and that she decided to run because “we need leaders who can meet the moment.”
But Matsui said she still has much more work to do in Congress, and that the relationships she’s built over 20 years in Washington are vital in helping her serve the public.

Matsui: “Once you’re in Congress, you have to learn how to govern, too. We cannot just throw everything out and start over again.”

Their losses will be felt beyond classrooms, as foreign students in particular drive scientific research and advancement. As the state with the most international students, California will likely feel the biggest impact.


Until this year, UCLA senior Syed Tamim Ahmad considered staying in the U.S. after graduation to pursue his dream of becoming a doctor. But when the Trump administration revoked thousands of student visas last spring, he spent many sleepless nights supporting his peers as his school’s international student representative. The experience left him exhausted.
Ultimately, most student visas were reinstated following pressure from courts and judges nationwide. But the speed and intensity of the revocations — coupled with a lack of institutional support — caused distrust and anxiety for international students like Ahmad.
“After all that fiasco, I decided no, not anymore,” said Ahmad, who was born in India and raised in the United Arab Emirates.
Ahmad, an integrated biology and physiological sciences major, is now planning to go to medical school in Australia, where he said he can do research “in peace” without fearing changes to his visa status or funding.
A recent report by the Institute of International Education shows that the number of international college students in the U.S. is mostly stable for now, with just a 1% decrease in enrollment this fall. However, the report also found a 17% decline in new international students enrolling in American colleges and universities. 
And from what students like Ahmad are saying, fewer are also likely to stay in the U.S. after graduation. 
Tightening federal policies about who can live and work in the U.S. from abroad threaten further decreases in enrollment and losses of talent. International students bring diverse viewpoints and perspectives that enrich the classroom environment and lead to scientific and economic advancements, researchers and faculty alike told CalMatters. 
The National Science Board found in a 2022 report that more temporary visa holders earn STEM doctorates than citizens and permanent residents combined, while international students earn a disproportionate amount of doctoral degrees in critical and emerging technologies. Foreign students in particular drive scientific research and advancement in the U.S.
Over 1.1 million international students studied in the U.S. during the last academic year. Of those students, 12.5% — over 140,000 — studied in California, making it the state with the largest international student population.
Last fall, international students made up 12% of the total student enrollment in the University of California system, with over 35,000 students from foreign countries. The California State University system enrolls nearly 14,000 international students, or about 3% of total enrollment.
This fall, the Cal State number has dropped to 12,122 students, according to the Cal State data dashboard. An official with the University of California Office of the President said the UC will not release enrollment data until later in December or January. 
The Institute of International Education collected responses from 828 U.S. higher education institutions for its report. While it is unclear how many of these were California institutions, the report states that 22% of responses were from western states.
The UC system has faced pressure from the California Legislature in recent years to increase the number of students from California. In response, the UC’s 2030 Capacity Plan proposed decreasing the amount of nonresident students. UC Regents also increased tuition for incoming nonresident students by over $3,400 starting this fall. 
Scenario modeling from the Association of International Educators showed California facing a projected 15% decline in overall international student enrollment this academic year. This would mean over 7,000 fewer international students for California’s two public university systems. The education nonprofit projects this drop could result in California losing more than $1 billion in revenue — based on the tuition and living expenses foreign students must pay — with similar enrollment trends across the country driving losses of nearly $7 billion nationwide.
Current realities for international students in California 
Dorothy, an undergraduate student from China and opinion columnist for The Daily Cal at UC Berkeley, said anxiety has increased among her peers under Trump’s presidency. She asked that her full name not be published due to fear of retaliation from the federal government.
Recently, her reporting on the international student experience in California has been bleak.
“A lot of students are just debating whether they should focus their future on their home country or continue to seek employment here” after graduating, she said.
She also said no amount of support from her university would be enough to make her feel fully secure from federal policy.
“If I get my visa revoked, I [won’t] be able to just come back and continue my education here, because [the decision] can be overruled by a larger government,” she said.
The total number of foreign students pursuing higher education in the U.S. under the F-1 visa, which classifies holders as nonimmigrant full-time students, had steadily increased since 2020, surpassing pre-COVID numbers in 2024. 
At the same time, the number of foreign students on temporary work authorizations, called Optional Practical Training, also increased. In the last academic year, nearly 300,000 foreign students were working with the authorization, a 21% increase from the prior year. Part of this accounted for graduate students entering the workforce. 
But graduate student numbers are also declining. This fall, graduate enrollment decreased by 12%, according to the Institute of International Education report, which may also be a response to Trump’s research funding cuts.

Sacramento State student Namrata, an international student from India who uses the singular name as her legal name, said her academic experience as a political science major has suffered due to her international student status.
She said faculty and peers have advised her to avoid writing about certain topics in her academic papers. Namrata referenced a recent English paper she wrote on freedom of speech, explaining that her professor cautioned her against making the piece overly political and discouraged her from addressing issues such as genocides or human rights violations. She said she feels restricted within her major and that her “degree doesn’t have value.”
“I don’t even have an equal chance to succeed as other students,” she said. “I wish I was them.”
Namrata is thinking about pursuing her master’s degree in another country or her home country.
Roma Singh, a freshman cinematic arts major from South Africa at Cal State Long Beach, said that while the immigration crackdown did “throw a wrench” in her plans, she ultimately decided that coming to California was the best decision for her aspirations. Singh hopes to pursue a career in Hollywood, and that being near Los Angeles will allow her to enter the industry.
Singh said that attaining her F-1 student visa was a difficult process. Embassy appointments were scarce, and she and her family scanned the embassy website for hours, several days in a row, to find an opening.
“I know some students who were hoping to attend Long Beach and they weren’t able to because they weren’t able to get an appointment,” Singh said.
International students are anxious about their futures 
Many international students come to the U.S. with the goal of staying permanently. But with the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigrants, several told CalMatters the U.S. is becoming a less desirable destination for education and residency.
The path for international students to stay in the U.S. after graduation isn’t easy. Through the temporary work authorization, F-1 visa holders can work in the U.S. for up to 12 months. The institute report shows that 92% of higher education institutions believe that without that work authorization, international students would likely choose other countries for their education.

Students may also pursue a work visa like the H-1B, which permits residency for an initial three-year period.
But a recent additional $100,000 fee for the H-1B visa — a common next step for international students wishing to stay in the U.S. after graduation — adds a roadblock for international students hoping to remain in the U.S. 
One major challenge for thousands of students, both current and prospective, has been navigating Trump’s June travel ban to and from 12 countries, mostly in the Middle East and Africa. For seven more countries spread across the globe, he enacted a partial travel ban, including forbidding new student visas.
Students who already had visas were not subject to the ban, but many were advised by their universities to not leave the U.S., as re-entry was not guaranteed due to rapidly changing federal policy.
What international students bring to California
International students are a key source of revenue for tuition-driven universities, as they are not eligible for federal financial aid and often pay full tuition. 
With 50% of students at the UC and Cal State paying zero tuition due to financial aid, the higher tuition paid by international and out-of-state students is advantageous, said Valerie Lundy-Wagner, associate director of the Public Policy Institute of California’s higher education center.  
For the 2026-27 academic year, full-time nonresident students at the UCs will pay over $36,000 more in tuition than resident students. Assuming a normal credit load, nonresident students at Cal State will pay $14,000 more in tuition.
But while international students provide more tuition revenue than domestic ones, Lundy-Wagner said potential declines in enrollment are not dire, as institutions will have time to assess the intensity of enrollment declines and “what risk to tuition revenue they can expect,” allowing them to redistribute resources accordingly.
“No one expects that next year there are going to be no international students,” she said. 
For institutions in California, particularly graduate programs, Lundy-Wagner said the presidential administration’s recent slashing of federal research funding is “more of an immediate issue” than declines in international enrollment.
And if enrollment declines are significant enough, the UC and Cal State systems can always supplement losses in tuition revenue with out-of-state students, as “there are still plenty of other states they could be recruiting from” where students would pay the same nonresident tuition.
But international students bring much more to California than simply additional tuition revenue, Lundy-Wagner said.
“The state has a diverse economy. Diverse economies require people who have diverse perspectives, and some of that will come in through folks who are coming from different countries,” she said. “It benefits California students and faculty to be interacting with folks who are from these different places and spaces.” 
Sujatha Moni, a women’s and gender studies professor from India who teaches at Sacramento State, agrees. 
She said that international students bring a unique perspective from their cultural backgrounds and interact with class content differently, providing domestic students with new viewpoints that they otherwise wouldn’t have been exposed to. 
“International students enhance the value of education on our campus,” she said. “They bring that critical diversity that is much needed, that is so enriching, for any campus.”
Applying to study in California now
Despite the challenges, Dorothy said she has never regretted her decision to come to California for her university education, citing interesting classes, high-caliber professors and a vibrant, international community as draw factors. 
She said if international families can afford to send their students to the U.S., and if they “value the experience and the education itself, it’s still worth it” to study here. She is encouraging her brother to also study in the U.S.
At UCLA, Ahmad said he is wary about recommending international students study in the U.S., citing how draining it has been for him to constantly worry about his visa status and potential cuts to research funding on top of being a student. He told his brother to “absolutely not” apply to the U.S. for law school.
“Given the current situation, I would say no,” he said. “But if it was like, a year back, … I would say yes.”
Ahmad looks forward to finally being in Australia, away from “the political drama” in the U.S. and the pressure to constantly advocate for himself and his international peers.
“I can also take a step back and, you know, be a student.”

Fearful of sharing sensitive information, California farmworkers started staying away from mobile medical clinics after President Trump took office. “There’s a lot of distrust,” said a doctor in Fresno County. 


On a scorching summer day, dozens of farm laborers paused their work picking banana peppers in a remote field 26 miles from Fresno and filed into a pop-up medical clinic. It was a chance to pick up medication and take basic health assessments, such as blood pressure and glucose monitoring. 
For almost a decade, the University of California San Francisco has been fielding mobile clinics like this one in rural Fresno County to support a hard-to-reach population of unauthorized immigrants who otherwise would avoid routine health care. 
The program gathered steam through the COVID-19 pandemic and during California’s decade-long expansion of health care to immigrants who are in the country without authorization. But this year, doctors are starting to notice that laborers aren’t showing up for care like they used to. 
The doctors sense the decline in participation is connected to the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement activity. UCSF mobile health clinic director Dr. Kenny Banh said patient visits to his rural mobile health vans started dropping at the beginning of the year, when President Donald Trump took office for his second term, vowing to crack down on illegal immigration.
“There’s a lot of distrust. I come from the university, I have a white coat; people are worried. We do as much as we can to tell them how we protect their data,” Banh said.

According to UCSF, visits to their mobile clinics dropped by around 36% as enforcement activity increased in California. In 2024, the mobile clinics would see on average 34 patients per outing, but in the past few months, the number of patients had dropped to around 22 per outing. People are also less willing to sign up for Medi-Cal, the state’s health insurance program for lower-income households, because they fear giving the government their data if they aren’t authorized to be in the country, Banh said.
It could get worse. 
California scaled back the law that allows all income-eligible residents regardless of immigration status to receive health insurance through Medi-Cal by temporarily limiting enrollment next year. And, counties are bracing for Medicaid cuts under the budget law Trump signed earlier this year that they say will make it harder for them to sustain programs serving distinct populations, like the one that brings health care to rural farmworkers.
“It’s going to be more restrictive in terms of work requirements, more regular re-enrollments, and more stringent requirements on states to comply with federal mandates,” Maria-Elena De Trinidad Young, an assistant professor of public health at UC Merced. “This is a push-out. The policy is really designed to restrict people from accessing Medicaid, or you know, in California, we call it Medi-Cal.”

Getting health care to remote communities
The mobile clinic Banh leads is part of a larger initiative from the Fresno Department of Public Health to reduce chronic and communicable diseases among hard-to-reach populations in the county. It gained funding most recently through a COVID-19 relief law that Fresno County steered to the clinics, which were led by UCSF and Saint Agnes Medical Center.
The COVID-19 money is running out, but the program has another year of funding locked in.

Clinics from both organizations can be found at community events, food distribution drives in rural communities, schools, and sometimes at farm working sites. The Saint Agnes mobile clinic van has two exam rooms inside for patients to receive care.

According to Ivonne Der Torosian, vice president of community health and well-being with Saint Agnes Medical Center, the program is designed to provide medical school students an opportunity to serve the community and create access to health care. 
“We are explicitly contracted to go out to rural Fresno County and serve agricultural workers, partner with employers of those farming workers, and also provide services to their families.”

Community health workers also provide health education and make referrals to nearby primary care providers for individuals who cannot be treated on-site. 
“We do basic screenings, including primary and preventive care, for many of the families we serve. We’re looking at connecting them to primary care providers,” Der Torosiran said. “We are providing vaccinations, we are providing glucose monitoring, and looking at their hypertension and blood pressure readings. So, really basic services they would get in a primary care setting.”

She said most of the patients she sees are farm workers and immigrants. Much of the rural population doesn’t have easy access to medical care — the nearest hospital is 35 miles away. Some of her patients may seek out the medical van for primary care because they don’t know where else to go. 
 “That’s why they come here. We give them the gist of what’s going on. But we’re limited on our supplies and what we can check,” she said.
Lehga says the number of people coming to the van has slowed down since immigration enforcement has kicked up. She has heard patients speaking to staff during the intake session talk about their fears of coming to the van and seeking out health care after a summer of intensified immigration raids.

“We did notice there used to be a lot more patients coming before they have gotten scared and they don’t want to because they’re not sure who will show up,” Lehga said. “They did feel comfortable before coming here because they knew it was safe. Now I think patients are more scared to come in general just because they don’t know who can show up.”
Dr. Arianna Crediford, chief resident physician with Fresno St. Agnes Rural Mobile Health, said that visits to the van have dropped by 15 to 20% this year. 
“We can speculate that it’s because of the issues with immigration at this time, that seems to be a big influence with farmworkers and food packing,” she said.
Crediford said she’s heard some patients mention the worry about seeking care and what that might imply for them but they have made it clear that they don’t collect immigration information and that they don’t need to talk to them about it at all.

“The idea that people have to be scared to receive health care is heartbreaking. It would really put their health conditions at risk, conditions that require weekly sometimes monthly follow-up. We’re the last line of defense that they’re able to go to besides emergency rooms when they come in with an actual life-threatening event. The day this population can’t comfortably and safely seek care their health is going to be put in danger because of that,” said Crediford.
The population, which is often uninsured, suffers from high rates of hypertension, diabetes or high blood sugar, and high cholesterol, oftentimes without treatment, Banh said. Frequently, the rural health team is the only health care provider patients see.

With fewer patients showing up for preventive care, Banh said, people will inevitably get sicker and end up in the emergency room. That costs more money and threatens to overwhelm the health system.
“People don’t disappear because you changed policy. They still need care. What you’re doing is delaying care until the outcomes are worse, and there’s not much you can do but hospitalize the patient,” he said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/070125-Farmworker-Harvest-LV-37.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-01 08:58:06.289754

(McKenzie Romero/Utah News Dispatch)The number of confirmed measles cases in Utah have surpassed 100, with state health officials reporting 102 as of Nov. 25, the last update available from the Thanksgiving holiday week. Of those, 24 were recorded in the last three weeks. 
Expecting the state and national measles surge to continue amid low vaccination rates, distrust and some isolating themselves from medical care, Utah health officials are bracing for the outbreak to get worse in coming months. 
“I think we actually have more to come before it gets better,” Utah State Epidemiologist Leisha Nolen told Utah News Dispatch on Wednesday.
The largest number of Utah’s confirmed cases are concentrated in Washington County in southwest Utah, where health officials have recorded 74 cases. But last week, the highly contagious virus started spreading in a high school further north, in Wasatch County, with at least eight students confirmed infected. 
That outbreak at Wasatch High School “really worries me,” Nolen said. 
“That is a new area to be infected. And it’s quite concerning that we suddenly saw so many people with this infection in one school,” she said. 











I think we actually have more to come before it gets better.


– Utah State Epidemiologist Leisha Nolen



Wasatch County has some of the lowest public school measles vaccination rates in the state, according to state data. 
“So we know that area is vulnerable to a continued spread of measles now that it’s introduced,” she said. “It’s one thing to have it localized in one school, but we know those kids go home, they have siblings at home, and they go do things that expose others. So I am worried that we’re going to have expansion from that in the immediate future.” 
The families involved in that outbreak are cooperating and isolating, Nolen said, but because measles is so contagious it’s likely to continue to spread because it took days to recognize the infections. “There were a few days nobody realized it was even measles, (and) they were probably going around while they were infectious,” she said.
Currently, Utah and Arizona are among the states in U.S. with the most recent outbreak cases of measles, according to The New York Times’ tracker. While case counts are slowing in Texas, that state so far has seen the largest outbreak with more than 800 cases, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
First confirmed measles case in Salt Lake County points to community spread

Meanwhile, for the first time in more than 20 years, the U.S. at the end of the year is poised to lose its elimination status, a long-held designation indicating that outbreaks in the country had been rare and rapidly contained. 
As of Nov. 25, a total of 1,798 measles cases have been confirmed in the U.S. across 43 jurisdictions, according to federal health officials. Of those, 12% or 212 have been hospitalized, and three people have died from measles. 
In Utah, 11 people have been hospitalized from this year’s outbreak, according to the state’s measles dashboard. “Happily,” Nolen said, “they’ve all been fairly minor and been able to be discharged fairly rapidly.” And the state hasn’t confirmed any deaths from measles. 
But Nolen urged Utahns to still take the virus seriously — noting it’s especially dangerous for young children who are unvaccinated or too young to get vaccinated. 
Why does Utah and the U.S. have a measles problem? 
Many factors are fueling this year’s measles outbreak in and outside of Utah. Nolen said it’s a combination of low vaccination rates, vaccine skepticism in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, and distrust in health institutions. 
“There’s a lot of misinformation and distrust fueling people’s behaviors and how they make choices, and that is making the outbreak worse,” she said. 
There are some similarities to vaccine skepticism stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. However, Nolen noted the measles outbreak is “not at all like COVID” because an effective vaccine has existed for decades and the virus was largely stamped out before vaccination rates began dropping. 
Today, most people are vaccinated and protected, but as more parents choose not to vaccinate their children, that puts those kids and others who are immunocompromised at risk. 
“I certainly think there’s a lot of factors contributing to why people don’t get vaccinations. Part of it is they don’t know who to trust,” Nolen said. “Certainly these days there’s so many conflicting voices … I understand why they don’t know who to believe. The internet has allowed it so that many voices are very loud, and it’s hard if you aren’t familiar with science or how different systems work to know who to trust.” 
Measles outbreaks across Utah highlight risk to babies and pregnant women 

Cultural and religious factors have also influenced the spread of measles across the U.S. and in Utah. The outbreak in West Texas earlier this year spread mainly through a large Mennonite community, according to The New York Times. 
Utah’s largest hotspot in Washington County, near the Arizona border, has measles cases that can be traced to some areas with a history of polygamy, formerly under control of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, a controversial sect that split from the mainstream Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints long ago. 
Today, communities including the town of Hildale in Utah and Colorado City, Arizona — an area known as Short Creek — are becoming increasingly ex-FLDS, but vaccination rates are still lagging to effectively protect against measles, the Tucson Sentinel reported. 
Distrust of government and medical systems continue to be major drivers in communities with low vaccination rates, Nolen said. 
“One of the things we’re trying to do is increase communications with these communities so that we know what they are concerned about and so that we can work with them to help improve their health and make them understand what’s the best way they can do it for themselves,” Nolen said. 
Purposeful isolation away from government and health systems could also be resulting in underreported case counts. 
Last month, Salt Lake County health officials announced they had identified what was likely the county’s first case of measles — but at the time deemed it “probable” because the patient wasn’t fully cooperating, declining to be tested or participate in disease investigation. 
“It’s going to be different in different communities, but I think there are communities that have not just a distrust in government, but they have a distrust of medical systems. And so those people are going to be much less likely to come forward, and so we won’t be able to know how many people are sick in those areas,” Nolen said.

“Other parts of our state, they might not love the government, but they still are very accepting of health care,” she added, “and so they will go forward to their health care providers, and that will help us give a better idea of those areas.” 
As a result, Nolen said it’s likely Utah health officials will have a “slightly skewed understanding” of how prevalent measles actually is across the state. 
“We have heard from many community members that they know that there are individuals in their community who have symptoms — even the patients believe they have measles, but they don’t go in and get tested,” she said. 
“So we know there are a number of people who just stay home and suffer through this illness without getting any medical attention,” Nolen said. “We can’t count those people, so we don’t know how many exist, but we certainly hear from community members that that is happening.” 
Nolen said she worries for those people — and especially “kids who don’t have a choice, their parents have chosen whether or not to vaccinate.” 
“I’m concerned about them,” she said, in addition to the “people who unfortunately have gotten misinformation and therefore aren’t choosing to protect their families.” 
What to know about measles
Unvaccinated people — including children too young to be vaccinated — are more likely to experience severe complications from a measles infection. 
Symptoms usually start seven to 14 days after infection. They include fever, cough, runny nose, and red or watery eyes. Tiny white spots typically appear inside the mouth two to three days after symptoms begin. Three to five days after the first symptoms, a rash appears. The rash usually begins as flat, red spots at the hairline or on the face, which then spread down the body.
Many people infected with measles will experience mild symptoms, but about 1 in 5 unvaccinated people need to be hospitalized, according to health officials. Young children, pregnant women and people who have weakened immune systems are more likely to have serious problems from measles.  



Vaccine recommendations vary depending on age and vaccination history 

Children should receive two doses of measles vaccine: one dose at 12 to 15 months of age and another at 4 to 6 years. 
Typically, health officials haven’t recommended early measles vaccination for all infants due to low risk — but in Washington County specifically, state officials have recommended an early, extra dose for infants who live in the area or are expected to travel there due to the high number of reported cases.  
Adults born before 1957 generally do not need to be vaccinated because they are likely already immune to measles due to widespread infection and illness before the measles vaccine became available in 1963. 
Adults who were vaccinated before 1968 should have a second dose because the vaccine used from 1963 to1967 was less effective than the current vaccine, which became available in 1968. 
Adults who were vaccinated in 1968 or later are considered fully protected whether they have one or two doses, though certain higher risk groups (like college students, health care workers and international travelers) should have two doses.

To learn whether you or your child needs a dose of the measles vaccine, health officials urge Utahns to talk to their doctors or check their immunization records. Most Utahns’ records are available through the secure Docket app or website.

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)An Alabama lawmaker has filed a bill that would allow local boards of education to pay their employees on a semi-monthly basis.
HB 62 sponsored by Ontario Tillman, D-Bessemer, would make local school boards pay employees on the first and and 16th of each month with exceptions for weekends, holidays and the first day of October, the start of the budget year. Currently, teachers are paid once a month.
“There is a need to kind of change how we do things when it comes to education. And I want to look at a different way forward,” Tillman said in a phone interview Tuesday. “I think that if we can start with changing the teacher pay from once a month to semi-monthly, we can provide different incentives for our teachers and make Alabama an attractive state to come and teach as well as allow us to retain our teachers here as well.”

Tillman, who was a special education teacher for 10 years, said he has heard several complaints from teachers about how often they’re paid.
“I understand exactly the complaints from a number of teachers as well as other school board employees. So it would affect the full scope of education. It would change the pay for every educator and staff personnel within the school system,” he said.
The bill would allow local boards to opt out of paying teachers on a semi-monthly basis within 60 days of the bill’s passage.
Tillman first filed the bill during the 2025 legislative session. He said he’s willing to advocate for having teacher pay more often despite pushback.
“This is a fight I’m willing to have, and I want to continue to have some movement on it,” Tillman said. “We’re receiving tons of pushback from this bill and it’s mainly coming from these schools’ CFOs and some school superintendents.”
Tillman also said states surrounding Alabama such as Georgia and Tennessee as well as some parts of Florida and Mississippi pay their teachers twice a month.
In 2022, Mississippi passed a law that allowed semi-monthly pay for teachers. As of July, only four counties in the state utilize the law.

Pictured are paddlers on the Ocmulgee River in Butts County. Georgia Rivers/Joe CookA massive data center project backed by Lt. Gov. Burt Jones and his family could be coming to Butts County, but many of the project’s details are still unknown.
Jones, a Republican, is running to be Georgia’s next governor.
The Highway 16 Interstate Health Development near Interstate 75 owned by Jones’ father is set to include a 450,000 square-foot hospital, 1.2 million square feet of medical office space and 11 million square feet of data centers – making it one of the biggest data centers currently planned in Georgia and placing it among the largest ever built by today’s standard.

The estimated $10 billion project is expected to go through more than 4.5 million gallons of water per day, more than tripling Butts County’s current water usage, and generate nearly $92 million per year in annual tax revenues when it is completed by 2040.
That’s just about all the information publicly available on the project, and those details come from a two-page development of regional impact filing that was submitted to the Georgia Department of Community Affairs.
The lack of information is a problem for environmental advocates like Fletcher Sams, executive director of the Altamaha Riverkeeper.
“Here’s what I don’t know: I don’t know how many megawatts it is. I also don’t know the cooling technology that they will use to cool the chips,” he said. “Those things are very important for me to know because the concern that I have for the location of it is that it’s in the upper Ocmulgee basin, and I’ve got 24 other data centers projected to come into that basin. The issue that I have with that basin is that between now and 2060, that region is going to see approximately 740,000 new residents.”
Decision-making on data centers left to local officials
The Georgia Department of Community Affairs recently approved new rules to bring large-scale data center developments under official state review, but critics say the rules fail to fully account for the cumulative burden the facilities have on the state’s energy and water supplies.
The amendments to its “developments of regional impact” process, for the first time, explicitly list “technological facilities (including data centers).” This comes after a self-imposed pause in processing regional impact reviews for data centers that was meant to give the department time to clarify the rules, DCA Commissioner Christopher Nunn said during a legislative subcommittee meeting in August. Some local governments began applying previous rules for impact reviews not intended for data centers since the projects did not fit under any of the previously specified development types, leading to a lack of consistency across the state.

While other proposals for data centers moved forward without a state review during the months-long pause, the Butts County development includes a hospital and commercial areas, which was enough to trigger a regional review.
Yet, the main issue, according to environmental advocates and community organizers, is the limitations of the process itself: The state’s impact review process is designed to be a communication tool, not a regulatory one.
“This simply ensures that neighbors are talking to neighbors, that cities are talking to counties, that other stakeholders are engaged in a process,” Nunn said to the legislative subcommittee at the time, stressing that his state agency serves merely as a “repository” for data, and the final regional impact report is purely advisory. The local government “maintains the authority to make the final decision on whether a proposed development will or will not go forward.”
The reliance on local government autonomy and information sharing leaves the state’s natural resources vulnerable to depletion, environmental advocates say.
But for Butts County, proponents of the mega project say the tax revenue would allow the county to advance and compete with neighboring metro areas. Residents often have to travel out of the county for many amenities, which is “not conducive to a good community,” said county manager Brad Johnson. He said that the development – called River Park – would diversify the county’s tax base, which currently largely comes from residents.
“We’re looking forward for some commercial or industrial tax generation to help take the burden off of our citizens, so I think not just Butts County, I think the entire region will benefit by the proposed project,” Johnson said.
Dan Diorio, vice president of state policy at the Data Center Coalition, a national association for the data center industry, said in a letter submitted during the public comment period on the revised regional review process that any new rules should consider the economic benefits data centers may bring. Attempts to reach the coalition for a comment for this story were unsuccessful.
“These tax revenues support investments in community priorities like education, transportation, and public safety that help enhance the quality of life for Georgians,” Diorio said.
Butts County’s planning commission is set to hear the developer’s application to rezone the property to mixed-use development in December, Johnson said, and the county commission can consider the application beginning in January, starting with a public hearing. Once rezoned, developers can begin construction.
Concerns about water usage
If you’ve ever sat down to watch a movie with your laptop on your lap and felt your legs start to become uncomfortable from the warmth, you know that computer components heat up when they’re doing their jobs. Data centers contain a lot more hardware than your laptop and perform complex calculations, generating massive temperature increases.
Keeping everything cool enough to function requires a lot of water – hundreds of thousands or millions of gallons per day – and Sams said it’s just not clear whether Georgia’s rivers can provide for all the planned data centers plus population growth and the power needs that come with that.
“Of the 25 data centers that I am tracking in the Ocmulgee, only nine have DRI information available,” Sams said, referring to the state impact review. “Of those nine, they’re going to withdraw close to 10 million gallons on top of the other withdrawals.”
Sams said Georgia has seen concerns over water usage surrounding large projects in recent years, pointing to the Bryan County Hyundai plant that has sparked concerns over water use.
“I’m worried about us over issuing withdrawal permits in the Ocmulgee basin for these data centers and for the power generation for the data centers when there is no backup,” Sams said.
For years, Georgia allowed the data center boom to expand without clear, statewide metrics, leading to what advocates call a “data vacuum,” a term Kristen Stampfer, director of Coastal Communities United, a nonprofit working to preserve rural communities, used in a letter submitted to DCA during a recent public comment period.
“These projects, collectively, represent an immense and largely unaccounted-for draw on Georgia’s finite resources … The proposed Project Sail in Coweta County alone demonstrates the scale of the challenge: its daily water use could reach 9 million gallons and its energy demand of 900 MW rivals that of a small city, yet it falls outside a rigorous review,” Stampfer said.
‘It’s not sustainable’
It’s not just water that has advocates concerned about the spike in data centers. All that new digital number crunching needs a lot of electricity – Georgia Power has claimed that data centers will consume about 80% of the new power generated in Georgia through 2031.
But like the water draw numbers, projecting exactly how much of Georgia’s juice will be squeezed out by data centers is a tough job, says Amy Sharma, executive director of Science for Georgia, a science advocacy nonprofit.
“If all the planned ones that we have found – which by the way all of these numbers are estimates based on publicly available information like newspaper articles and like DRI reports and stuff like that. So who knows? We’re not getting exact numbers from the data center developers themselves – there’s about 40 plans for the state that would take up 14 gigawatts,” Sharma said.
According to the U.S. Department of Energy, 14 gigawatts is enough energy to power 1.4 billion LED lightbulbs.
“It’s just bonkers,” Sharma said. “There’s no other word for this besides bananas, right? Like it’s just off the rails. It’s not sustainable.”
Utility rates have been rising in Georgia and were a major issue for Democrats, who flipped two seats currently held by Republicans on the five-seat Georgia Public Service Commission running on energy affordability. The two incumbents had voted to approve six rate increases over the last two years, resulting in an estimated average annual increase of about $500 for the average household.
The politics
The Butts County property has been at the center of a political battle over hospital regulations and alleged self-dealing in the past.
Jones came under criticism in 2023 for a push to rewrite rules for new hospitals in a way critics said was catered to allow for a hospital to be built on property owned by Jones’ father.
That effort fell short, but Gov. Brian Kemp signed a bill easing those hospital regulations last year.
Jones’ push toward loosening those restrictions has already become campaign fodder in the Republican gubernatorial primary.

Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr, who is also jockeying to be the Republican candidate for governor next year, accused Jones of using his office to line his family’s pockets.
“If you honor me by allowing me to be your next Governor, unlike the Lt. Governor, I will promise you this: I will not change the rules or rig the system to enrich myself or my family on your backs or the backs of our fellow Georgians,” Carr said on social media in October.
A billboard standing over the Butts County site reads “Burt Jones’ $10 billion family project, Rewritten laws. Family profits. That’s Burt Jones’ family payday.”
The billboard was paid for by Keep Georgia Strong Action Inc., an independent campaign group that supports Carr.
Jones’ spokesperson Kayla Lott dismissed the issue.
“This is a simple rezoning application by a private company,” she said. “It’s a nonstory.”
“As for Chris Carr, he’s not a serious candidate. He’s grasping at straws because he’s stuck in a distant third place, his fundraising has collapsed, and the only people paying attention to him at this point are the ones on his payroll,” she added.

Dina Neal to cap corporate homeownership in 2023, but Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo vetoed it. (Photo: Jeniffer Solis/Nevada Current)For the first time in Nevada, a bipartisan supermajority of state lawmakers petitioned to add their own topic to an ongoing special session called by the governor. The issue seen as important enough to cross the aisle over: corporate home ownership.
The bill that emerged from that effort ultimately fell one vote shy in the state Assembly, but its defeat came with promises from Democrats and Republicans alike to continue working on proposed legislation with the goal of reintroducing a bill in the next regular legislative session in 2027.
“People are being priced out of homes,” Democratic Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro told reporters after the special session adjourned. “You can talk to almost anyone and find an anecdotal story of someone who was competing against a corporation with unlimited coffers in order to buy a home… We owe it to Nevadans to work on solutions to home ownership and to affordability issues, and that was absolutely something that we should have passed.”
Assembly Minority Leader Greg Hafen (R-Pahrump), before voting against the bill in his chamber, called the issue “something that is worthy of this body to look at.”
“I just don’t believe this legislation is there yet,” he continued.
Senate Bill 10 of the 36th Special Session was designed to stop corporations from gobbling up a critical mass of  available properties, giving Nevadans a better shot at the American dream of homeownership.
It would have placed a 1,000-unit cap on the total aggregate number of homes that could be purchased in a year by private investors. The Nevada Secretary of State’s Office would help monitor a new corporate homeowner registry and determine when the 1,000-unit limit was reached.
The legislation was presented by state Sens. Dina Neal, a Democrat from North Las Vegas, and Ira Hansen, a Republican from Sparks.
Neal brought similar legislation in 2023. The bill, supported by Hansen, was vetoed by Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo.
That year, a Stateline analysis of data from real estate analytics firm CoreLogic found that nearly a quarter of all single-family homes sold in 2021 had been purchased by investors. In Nevada, the same analysis found, the share of investor purchases increased from 18% to 30% from 2020 to 2021.
Neal revived her corporate home ownership legislation in the 2025 regular session, though she made the cap a paltry 100 housing units after reading in the Las Vegas Review Journal that one corporate investor had purchased 264 homes in a single day. Hansen said during the floor vote in May that he had “been asked by the executive branch to support a caucus ‘no’ position” and would “very reluctantly” vote in opposition.
The Lied Center for Real Estate at the University of Nevada Las Vegas estimated investors owned roughly 15% of homes in the City of Las Vegas. That percentage was expected to grow both in Nevada and across the nation.
The bill under consideration by lawmakers in the special session set the aggregate cap at 1,000. Industry groups pushed behind the scenes for a 2,000 limit, but those requests were dismissed by Hansen and Neal. 
New builds, manufactured homes, apartments, condominiums, townhomes, and foreclosures bought by credit unions would have been excluded from the cap.
Jonathan Norman with the Nevada Coalition of Legal Service Providers urged lawmakers to reconsider the exclusion of town homes and condos since they are often seen as “the first step of the property ladder.”
“If you have young people who cannot afford a home, or the average price is $400,000, a condo is a good way to start building equity,” he said. “I’m afraid if we start exempting those, the eye of corporate buyers and private equity might be swift to condos and town homes and freeze out those people who might not have a down payment.”
Hansen said the exclusion for new builds addressed the “political reality” of potential opposition from industry groups. 
“Southern Nevada Home Builders didn’t want to be included in the bill and they would have aggressively opposed it,” he said.
The association still opposed the bill.
David Goldwater, a lobbyist with the Nevada Home Builders Association, warned the bill could still have “unintended consequences.”
Other opponents raised concerns about the constitutionality of the bill, specifically the “dormant commerce clause,” by which states can’t enact measures that interfere with interstate commerce.
 ‘Political reality’ 
“I have so much respect for this institution,” said an audibly shaken Assemblymember Alexis Hansen (R-Sparks) before casting what was seen as the deciding ‘no’ vote that killed the corporate home ownership bill, “but I don’t have a respect for what has transpired in the last few days, but particularly in just the last couple of hours.”
Hansen went on to say that her signing of the petition to have the bill considered during the special session was not a commitment to vote for it on the floor. (She voted against the 2023 version of the bill. The 2025 regular session version of the bill never made it to the Assembly, meaning she did not have a chance to vote on it.)
“I just wanted us to be able to bring the bill and hear it, find those solutions that we needed to,” she continued.
Hansen said she would “work diligently” in the upcoming months.
The assemblymember could not be reached by the Nevada Current for additional comment.
The effort to rein in the purchasing power of corporations was not on the list of items for the special agenda. Alexis Hansen and her husband, state Sen, Ira Hansen (R-Sparks), worked with the Democratic caucuses on a petition to force the issue to be added to the special session.
The bill was brought forward as intense negotiations around the film tax credit were happening behind closed doors. Neal attempted to shoot down rumors that her bill’s resurrection was brought “so I can feel comfortable to vote on film.”
“I am not horse trading for corporate investors for a vote on film,” Neal said.
(Neal would, later that day, vote for the film studio bill, but she would say in a floor statement and to reporters afterward that her vote was cast out of personal loyalty to Senate Majority Leader Cannizzaro, who Neal credited with saving her life earlier this year after a medical episode.)
Ira Hansen also pushed back on rumors he was being “offered some sort of deal” in exchange for support of the film tax credit bill.
“Everybody knows I’m a no” on the film bill, he said, “and that’s not going to change.” 
Hansen would go on to vote against the film studio bill.
The corporate housing bill received attention and support from Democratic lawmakers throughout the state, including U.S. Rep. Dina Titus, who called in to support; U.S. Rep. Steven Horsford, who wrote a letter in support; and Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford, who participated in the hearing.
Ford, who is running for governor, used much of his time to attack Lombardo for killing previous iterations of the bill.
When given the opportunity to “limit out-of-state corporations from buying our homes and pricing Nevadans out of their communities, he failed to do so,” Ford said. “Because of his dereliction of duty Nevada families are suffering and Wall Street hedge funds are the largest landlords in Clark County having amassed thousands of homes.”

(Photo: Charly Triballeau/AFP via Getty Images)New York’s mayor-elect, Zohran Mamdani, campaigned on a promise to raise the city’s income tax on its richest residents from 3.9% to 5.9%. Combined with the state income tax, which is 10.9% for the top bracket, the increase would cement the city’s position as having the highest taxes on top earners in the country.
It set off a chorus of warnings about the tax flight of the city’s wealthiest residents.
Hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman claimed that both the city’s businesses and wealthy residents “have already started making arrangements for the exits.”
New York Gov. Kathy Hochul echoed the concern, opposing the proposal “because we cannot have them leave the state.” Before the election, Mamdani’s opponent, former New York governor Andrew Cuomo, joked that if Mamdani won, “even I will move to Florida.”
I research whether high earners actually move when their taxes go up. My colleagues and I have analyzed millionaire taxes in New Jersey and California, the migration of Forbes billionaires globally and decades of IRS data tracing where Americans with million-dollar incomes live.
Top earners are often thought of as “mobile millionaires” who are ever searching for lower-tax places to live. In reality, they’re often reluctant to leave the places where they built their careers and raised their families.
At the same time, there are grains of truth in the tax migration arguments, so it’s important to carefully parse the evidence.
 A small fraction of a small fraction

The first fact is simple: Millionaires have low migration rates.
Mobility in America is highest among people who are still searching for their economic place in life. Workers who earn the lowest wages move across state lines at relatively high rates, about 4.5% per year, often in search of more affordable housing. People making $1 million-plus a year move only half as often: Just 2.4% of them pack up each year.
When millionaires do move, it rarely appears to be for tax reasons. For example, Florida is the top destination for New York movers in general. But among the richest 1% of New Yorkers, the top destination is Connecticut, followed by New Jersey and California, all three of which levy a millionaire tax.
Some millionaires certainly do favor lower-tax destinations. But many moves to low-tax states are offset by moves in the opposite direction to higher-tax states, and many other moves take place between states that have the same tax rate.
Overall, only about 15% of millionaires who move end up with a lower tax bill. That shows the rich are willing and able to move for tax reasons. But because only about 2.4% of millionaires move each year – and only a fraction of those moves reduce their taxes – overall tax migration ends up being a small fraction of a small fraction. Not never, but not often.
 Some benefits don’t have a dollar sign

Migration is mostly a young person’s game.
The most mobile Americans are recent college graduates who are brimming with potential, searching for work and unburdened by major responsibilities. Their rate of migration from one state to another is over 12%, more than four times the rate of millionaires.
The typical adult mover is about 30 years old, while the highest income earners are typically about 50. People choose where to build their careers and families decades before they reach their peak earnings phase.
By the time someone earns enough to be taxed in the highest brackets, they’re usually late into their careers. They are almost always married, often have children at home, own their homes and, in many cases, own a business. Their social lives and their economic success are linked to local networks of colleagues, clients and connections built up over a long career. Moving away from those networks means giving up a great deal of social capital and starting over somewhere new.
Top earners know that some states have lower taxes, but for most, tax flight is simply a bad deal. The social and economic costs of uprooting are bigger than the tax savings.
 When your social world collapses

Two recent events showed why the rich generally stay where they are – and what it takes to move them.
The first was the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which President Donald Trump signed into law in late 2017. The tax reform package capped the federal deduction for state and local taxes and raised taxes on high earners in states like New York, New Jersey and California. In a Wall Street Journal op-ed titled “So Long, California. Sayonara, New York,” economists Arthur Laffer and Stephen Moore predicted that 800,000 people a year would flee those states.
They didn’t. A colleague and I studied every millionaire tax return in the country for two years before and after the reform. Nothing happened. There was no increase in migration out of the states where tax burdens rose. The predicted exodus simply did not occur.
We were about to wrap up the study and call it case closed. Then something unexpected did happen: In early 2020, millionaires began leaving high-tax states in large numbers. Low-tax states saw no comparable outflows. The pattern matched those tax-flight predictions from just a few years earlier.
It was the COVID-19 pandemic, and it brought a profound shock to the social lives of city residents.
Offices emptied out, with entry swipes in major cities dropping by nearly 90%. Time spent at work fell sharply, local amenities were shuttered, and time spent alone grew as in-person contact became a health risk. K–12 schools closed, disrupting children’s relationships with teachers and classmates.
For many households, this was also a strange form of freedom, and a chance to rethink the geography of work and life, especially for top earners who could work remotely from anywhere. Disconnected from the bonds of place, top earners moved and clearly favored low-tax destinations.
The lesson is that social lives and economic policies are deeply intertwined. The 2017 tax reform had no effect on migration because the social cost of moving is high – especially for people at the peak of their careers who are enjoying the many social benefits of economic success. As long as those connections to others are strong, they outweigh the appeal of moving to lower-tax states.
When the pandemic broke apart so much of social life, the ledger shifted. If your office, school, friendships and daily routines no longer anchor you in place, what is keeping you in a high-tax place?
But by early 2023, as social and economic life returned to normal, we found that millionaire migration patterns mostly reverted to their prepandemic baselines.
In other words, the surge in tax flight was temporary.
 If you want the rich, appeal to the young

There is a big lesson here for state and city policies.
Every place wants to attract high-income earners and the spending power and tax dollars that accompany their salaries. Many policymakers think that tax cuts will lure them in, but this is mostly a fool’s errand. In normal times, the rich are deeply rooted and not movable.
The real opportunity lies in attracting and retaining the next generation of top earners – young people who are unattached to place and looking for opportunities to build their careers and their lives. Places that draw young professionals build the pipeline of future top earners.
Those early-career folks are mobile, but they are not thinking about the top tax rate. Their salaries are low. They are trying to find good jobs, pay the rent, form relationships and start families. They hope to be successful enough to one day be paying Mamdani’s millionaire tax. For the time being, though, they need the basic costs of living to be manageable. Soon they will need affordable child care and good public schools for their kids.
If the city helps them that far along, many of them would gladly pay a millionaire tax when and if the time comes. In this light, the Mamdani plan is simply practical: Higher taxes at the top support the services and quality of life that keep the next generation in the city.

(Andi Rice for Alabama Reflector)A Doug Jones gubernatorial campaign was always going to be a “yes, but” proposition.
Can Jones do the job? Yes. Absolutely. But competence is no guarantee of victory.
Can Jones become his party’s nominee? Yes. Almost certainly. But there are two other Democrats in the race — Will Boyd and Chad ‘Chig’ Martin — and Jones will first have to lock down his base. All three candidates should be mindful of Republicans crossing over for chaos purposes, especially if the GOP contest is noncompetitive.

Can Jones raise money? Yes. He pulled in $25.7 million in his 2017 U.S. Senate race and $31 million for his reelection bid in 2020. But in 2017, he faced former Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore, who had long struggled to raise money. And unlike 2020, Jones is not the sitting U.S. senator in this race. That’s likely GOP nominee Tommy Tuberville, who has already raised $8.1 million for the campaign.
Can Jones win?
Yes.
The former senator is a formidable campaigner. Sure, he got dealt a good hand in the 2017 campaign. Moore’s nomination divided the GOP, even before the former chief justice faced multiple allegations of sexual assault and misconduct.
Still, good cards are worthless if you don’t play them right. Jones was a model of campaign discipline, laughing off repeated Republican efforts to bait him. In the white hot national spotlight that fell on Alabama that year, there wasn’t a single serious misstep or mishap from the Jones campaign.
Next year’s environment might also benefit Jones. The economy seems shaky. Republicans appear indifferent to rising health care costs. President Donald Trump’s net favorability rating in Alabama, per the Economist/YouGov poll, was 4.9% as of last week – not  a particularly great mark in a state he won by 30 points last year.
And Democrats will almost certainly vote for Jones with more enthusiasm than Republicans will for Tuberville. Particularly if Tuberville’s campaign continues issuing comically arrogant statements like this one, treating his election as a foregone conclusion
But.
There are more Republicans in Alabama who will vote for Tuberville with stone faces than there are Democrats who will cast their ballots with a smile. Straight-ticket voting means that candidate quality and even charisma are irrelevant. In 2022, straight-ticket ballots accounted for two-thirds of all the votes cast in Alabama. Straight-ticket Republican ballots were 44% of all votes cast.
In 2020, Jones outraised Tuberville three-to-one and was far more visible and public than his opponent, who said nothing about his plans and largely limited his interviews to conservative lickspittles. He still won.
It won’t be a surprise if Tuberville repeats that turtle strategy in a general election battle with Jones. It worked before. So long as he has that R next to his name, Tuberville is the favorite.  Even if he wears a Florida Gators jersey all year.
And that’s before we get to Alabama demographics. In general, we are older, more rural and less educated than the country as a whole. Not trends that favor Democrats.
So yes, it’s probable, even likely, that Jones falls short next November.
But Jones has done a critical service for Democrats.
First, his presence almost certainly means the party will avoid repeating the disaster of 2022.
Underfunding and internecine squabbles have undermined Alabama Democrats’ recruitment efforts for years. But the party somehow managed to find a space below that ground-level bar in 2022. The party’s slate of statewide candidates that year consisted of amateurs and novices. None could raise money. All got blown out.
That almost wrecked downballot Democrats. Amid abysmal turnout, several Black legislators in safe blue seats found themselves in contests that shouldn’t have been close. Rep. Thomas Jackson, D-Thomasville, who represents a district that is about 60% Black, barely squeaked by a Republican opponent.
Provided Jones can raise money and wage a statewide campaign, Democrats should hold what they have. Depending on how the U.S. Supreme Court rules in a critical redistricting case out of Louisiana, Jones’ campaign could also be critical for the fortunes of U.S. Rep. Shomari Figures, D-Mobile, a likely target of future Republican redistricting efforts.
And while straight-ticket voting could doom Jones statewide, it could be a benefit in a few marginal legislative seats, particularly those in Huntsville. Probably not enough to end the GOP supermajority, but enough to cut it and bring new faces and energy to Goat Hill.
The party should be working from now through qualifying in early January to find as many viable candidates to stand in as many legislative districts as possible. A Jones campaign will help local candidates with statewide exposure and fundraising. A large field of local candidates can keep voters engaged and enthusiastic for Jones.
Win or lose, Jones has given Democrats a rare opportunity for growth next year. Yes, Alabama will be a red state for the foreseeable future. But the former senator gives the party a chance to add some purple hues.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ALR_NoKings_BHM_101825-19-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-12-01 08:58:06.289754

(Photo: Anna Liz Nichols)Top lawyers for Consumers Energy and DTE Energy have donated to a Michigan attorney general candidate’s primary race, raising conflict of interest questions about whether the utilities are trying to influence a prosecutor who may handle their legal and regulatory cases. 
The candidate, current Democratic Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald, would stand opposite the utilities’ attorneys in the courtroom or in regulatory battles, should she win. 
The next attorney general will be tasked with representing residential customers in especially high stakes legal and regulatory battles over controversial data center plans, and the cases’ outcomes will for decades impact the climate, how much residents pay for energy, and utilities’ bottom lines. 
The current term-limited attorney general, Dana Nessel, has been viewed as a national leader in protecting consumers and taking on utilities. The utilities likely want to avoid a repeat of Nessel’s tenure, industry observers say, and the donations highlight an avenue in which they can influence the state’s potential next top cop. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The donations represent “a very serious conflict of interest,” said Craig Holman, a lobbyist with Public Citizen, a Washington D.C. campaign finance watchdog. 
“When you get a special interest giving money to candidates, and they’ve got something pending before that office, then they are trying to curry favor by making campaign contributions,” Holman added. 
McDonald did not respond to Michigan Advance’s requests for comment. 
A review of the most recent state campaign finance filings shows executive level attorneys from DTE and Consumers each gave $1,000 to McDonald. That includes DTE’s senior vice president and chief legal officer, Katherine Lorenz, and Kelly Hall, deputy legal counsel for Consumers. A donation of $100 was made by Andrea Hayden, a lower level DTE Energy legal department employee. And a $250 donation was made by Consumers Energy lobbyist Hillary Kipp. 
The donation sizes are significant for a state level attorney general primary. While the state’s utilities are prolific campaign donors, it is unusual for their attorneys to make multiple donations to a prosecutor’s primary campaign. 
In a statement, a DTE spokesperson said, “It’s not appropriate for us to comment on individual employees’ personal contributions.” 
A Consumers spokesperson said, “Any individual political contribution made by a company employee is done in his or her personal capacity – and not on behalf of CMS Energy.”
Requests to speak with the individuals were ignored or denied.

McDonald has so far reported raising $840,000, more than the other four candidates combined. Records show she also has far more support from the state’s largest corporations than her opponents. Delegates will select the nomination for each party’s candidates at their respective April conventions. 
Among McDonald’s top competitors in the race is Washtenaw County Prosecutor Eli Savit, who, in a statement to the Advance, sought to draw a difference between he and McDonald on corporate donations, which he said he is not taking. 
He also noted he signed the League of Conservation Voters’ No Utility Money challenge, under which campaigns will not knowingly accept contributions from utility PACs, executives or lobbyists. 
Savit said rejecting utility money is especially “crucial” for an attorney general candidate. 
“The AG is the one position in Michigan charged with protecting consumers, workers, and our natural resources – frequently against powerful corporate interests on the other side,” he said.

Meanwhile, Mark Totten, a third Democratic candidate, has received $1,100 from a Consumers Energy executive, but records do not show a donation from either utilities’ legal counsel. 
The revelations come amid a state ballot initiative effort that would prohibit regulated utilities and their executives from making political donations. If approved, the type of donations made by the executive level attorneys to McDonald would be banned.
Karlee Weinmann, a researcher for the utility industry watchdog Energy and Policy Institute, questioned McDonald’s decision not to respond to questions about the utility donations in the context of the ballot initiative effort.  
“To sort of sidestep questions about who is funding a campaign runs counter to this strong public call for greater transparency across the board in Michigan,” Weinmann said. 
Why utilities are so interested in the race
Weinmann said Nessel has been “fiercely advocating” for residential ratepayers, and effectively communicating with the public about the arcane regulatory process, which has helped raise public awareness about utility issues.
The attorney general has regularly intervened over the last seven years in regulatory proceedings at which the cost structures for residents’ DTE and Consumers bills are determined. These interventions have saved ratepayers billions of dollars at the expense of DTE and Consumers’ bottom lines. 
Weinmann pointed to an anecdote she said is emblematic of the important role the attorney general’s office plays in utility affordability, and may explain utilities’ interest in the current primary.  
In a May 2024 rate case in which DTE sought a $266 million increase in customers’ costs, the company tried to pass on expenses for executives’ private jet travel. Nessel successfully blocked the proposal. 
Nessel calls for reduction of proposed DTE electric rate increase

In a press release at the time, Nessel wrote, “When the shady details crammed into these filings emerge into the daylight, a lot of the proposed spending is questionable at best, and at times downright insulting to customers.”
Nessel argued DTE should only be able to increase customer costs by $111m – about $155m below DTE’s request. Regulators granted a $113 million increase, which observers deemed a clear loss for DTE. 
Weinmann said Nessel has “set a national standard for how attorneys general can and should be operating with regard to monopoly utilities and their attempts to pass inappropriate expenses on to ratepayers.” 
“Certainly the utilities in Michigan have experienced the consequences of an attorney general who is unwilling to back down and unafraid to step to them,” Weinmann added. 
Legal and regulatory battles 
The next attorney general will handle highly consequential regulatory and legal battles over controversial data centers proposed for Michigan.
The centers are already causing energy rate spikes across the country, and consumer advocates fear the same is poised to happen in Michigan, unless the state acts. 
In 2023, the state passed a climate law that requires utilities to fully transition to clean energy by 2040. But the law includes an “offramp” that allows utilities to keep fossil fuel plants online, or build new gas plants, if clean energy can’t handle the grid’s load. 
Whitmer signs climate change legislation setting 100% clean energy standard for Michigan by 2040 

Data centers require a huge amount of energy, and those planned for Michigan are poised to trigger the offramp. 
Utilities view data centers as a lifeline because they make far more money off of capital investments for gas than they do for renewable energy generation. 
Already, DTE and Consumers are making plans for new gas plants. 
“When we’re looking ahead at a data center rush in Michigan, the enormous stakes of climate action – or inaction – and the rate pressure people are feeling amid a broader affordability crisis, it’s really a pivotal time, and one that demands strong leadership from the attorney general,” Weinmann said.
Cause for recusal?
While the donations to an attorney general primary race are unusual, utility industry trade groups regularly donate to national attorney general campaign groups. And the utility industry isn’t alone. 
Crypto and gambling industry interests in recent years gave huge donations to national attorney general groups that pass money on to state candidates who would later work the industries’ cases, Holman noted. 
Some judges have recused themselves from cases involving campaign donors, he added, but they are the exception and not the norm. Professional ethical guidelines do not demand judges or prosecutors recuse themselves from cases, but they should, Holman said. 
More broadly, the situation highlights the need for reform, he added. 
“It’s just a pure conflict of interest and the ideal solution is to go to public financing and avoid significant public contributions altogether,” Holman added.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Facetune_11-06-2024-14-19-36-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-12-01 07:57:26.376274
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-01 12:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Why CT lawmakers may take up universal school meals issue in 2026,Laura Tillman,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/01/ct-universal-school-meals-legislative-session-2026/,Disruptions to programs like SNAP have renewed calls for CT to do what it can to ensure that children are fed in schools.,"With food insecurity on the rise and changes to programs like SNAP, some Connecticut lawmakers are making a renewed push to pass legislation during the 2026 session that would guarantee universal meals for students across the state, regardless of their school district. Currently, students have access to a mix of free, reduced price and paid meals, depending on household income, with some districts opting to provide free meals to all children.
Here’s what you need to know about universal school meals in Connecticut and why it may come up in next year’s legislative session.
Who is eligible for free school meals in Connecticut?
There are three ways student meals work in Connecticut schools. 
First, there are students who get free meals — meaning breakfast and lunch. A family of four qualifies if they make less than $41,795 before taxes for the 2025-26 school year.
There are also students whose families pay a reduced fee for school meals. Again for a family of four, these families must make less than $59,478 before taxes. 
And there are students whose families pay full price because their income exceeds the limits for free or reduced price meals. Lunch for these students typically costs between $3 and $4.50 depending on the school district.
But some districts offer free meals to all children. How does that work? 
Under the Community Eligibility Provision, or CEP, if more than 25% of a school’s population qualifies for free meals, then the school can choose to serve all students free breakfast and lunch. The school can then be reimbursed with federal funds, at a rate of 1.6. That means, if 40% of students at the school qualify for free meals, the school will be reimbursed for 1.6 times that amount, or 64%. The school will then have to find funds within its budget for the other 36% of the student population’s meals. Some districts have a high enough percentage of students who qualify that they do not have to contribute any additional funds.
There are also a handful of districts that provide universal breakfast, but not lunch. 
How many Connecticut districts offer free meals to students? 
Currently, 63 districts participate, but at 12 of those districts the program is only available at some of the schools. That’s out of a total of 202 school districts in the state. 
My district used to offer universal meals but doesn’t anymore. Why? 
In 2023, the FDA changed the CEP provision so that schools with 25% of students qualifying for free meals could opt-in to provide universal meals. Previously, the threshold was set at 40%. Some Connecticut school districts that fell within that 25% to 40% range decided to opt-in, but later determined the program was too expensive to continue and chose to opt back out. 
What kind of food do students receive as part of universal meals in Connecticut? 
There is no universal menu that school districts must follow in Connecticut, so different districts contract with different vendors. But all student lunches must include five components: a dairy, protein, starch, vegetable and fruit. 
Why do lawmakers and advocates want to provide universal meals in Connecticut, even in wealthy districts? 
Food insecurity is hitting Connecticut residents hard. Disruptions to programs like SNAP caused by the government shutdown and populations being shut out of the program altogether have renewed calls for the state to do what it can to ensure that children are fed. The One Big Beautiful Bill act excludes certain groups from SNAP benefits, including refugees and asylum seekers from access to SNAP benefits as well as some young adults, veterans and people experiencing homelessness.
But even before those restrictions were put in place, lawmakers in Connecticut have advocated for universal school meals for a number of reasons.
While some school districts in Connecticut may have a low percentage of students who quality for free meals, lawmakers and advocates say that making such meals universal has a number of benefits. First, when meals are available at no cost, participation in these programs go up.
“It changes the culture of the school meal program,” said Marlene Schwartz, director of the Rudd Center for Food Policy & Health at the University of Connecticut. “It doesn’t become just a program seen as something low-income kids participate in, it becomes something everybody does,” reducing stigma and ensuring that kids who are hungry are fed. Children with full bellies, advocates say, are able to focus on learning.
Making such a program universal would also cut out the cost and time of the paperwork associated with parsing what meals are available to which students. That would allow directors of food programs to focus their time and energy on getting the best quality food to their students. Feeding more kids would also give smaller districts greater purchasing power to make bulk deals with vendors. 
In Connecticut, the high cost of living also means that there are many families who do not currently qualify for free meals, but who are struggling with the cost of groceries and would greatly benefit, according to Schwartz. 
“The gap between the amount you can make to no longer qualify and amount of money you need to take care of a family of four in Connecticut is many thousands of dollars, and in that gap are a lot of people who need help and aren’t getting it,” she said. Because low- income families qualify for free lunch, Schwartz said that most people assume that all kids who need free meals get them. “No, they don’t!” she said. “They don’t!”
How would Connecticut fund universal meals?
That remains to be seen, but one of the proposals on the table is a tax on sugary drinks. Schwartz, for one, is in favor of this idea. 
“I thought that was the most brilliant idea I had ever heard,” she said. “A public health home run.” Because drinks like soda are linked with negative health outcomes, cities across the U.S. have used such taxes as a method to fight obesity and diabetes while simultaneously raising money for quality of life improvements for their citizens.
Philadelphia, for example, taxes such drinks at 1.5 cents per ounce and has used those funds to pay for a free preschool program, among other initiatives.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG_8240-scaled-e1691432418382.jpg,,,2025-12-01 07:57:26.376274

(Courtesy of Michael Garcia)Early voting was still a few weeks away when, in September, the announcement came down. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham was offering her endorsement to JoAnne Vigil Coppler in the crowded race to replace two-term Santa Fe Mayor Alan Webber.
“I kind of jokingly-but-seriously said, ‘After I win, I’m still going to reach out to you because I want to strongly partner,’” Michael Garcia said of his comments to the governor. Garcia, a city councilor who on Nov. 4 won the eight-person ranked choice election, will take office in January. “To address the challenges that the city is facing, it’s going to require a strong coalition built between the city, the governor’s office, our state legislative delegation, the county, our federal delegation,” he said.
For Garcia, those challenges range from the simple, like finding someone to fill his soon-to-be-vacant seat representing District 2 on the Santa Fe City Council and finding a building to serve as the new “Southside Mayor’s Office,” to the complex, like addressing the “decades of deferred maintenance” on the city’s roads and tackling regional issues of affordable housing and homelessness. For issues like the latter, he said he hopes to work with residents and officials at the local, county and state levels to identify and solve shared problems.
In recent years, tensions between city and state leaders have at times spilled into the public’s view. In 2023, the state Department of Finance and Administration took back more than $1 million that had previously been earmarked for the city’s parks because of the city’s failure to meet auditing deadlines. And in 2024, Lujan Grisham told reporters that the City of Santa Fe had “an obvious leadership problem” during litigation over the controversial Plaza monument known locally as the “obelisk.”
Garcia said he hopes to move past those incidents and build a strong relationship with state officials.
When he takes office in January, he will have a long list of day-one tasks. He said he hopes to issue a call to the public to replace his seat on the City Council and find creative ways to solicit public feedback, like a town-hall style forum, before officially nominating them for the job. He also said he’s working to establish a mayoral office on the city’s Southside and plans to split his time between there and City Hall.
He’s also exploring whether to start fresh with the city’s top non-elected officials. He plans to post job listings for influential positions including city manager, city clerk, city attorney and more. The people currently in those jobs are invited to re-apply, he said.

Before he issues policy proposals, he said he wants to meet with department heads in City Hall and better assess their needs. For example, he wants to issue a strategic plan to guide the city’s development of workforce and affordable housing. On his first day as mayor, he said, he’ll get to work on figuring out what works best for the city — whether it’s tiny houses, townhomes, traditional single-family homes or something in between. 
He also wants to focus on the capital city’s aging infrastructure. Across the state, roads have deteriorated to their worst condition in recent history, according to a new state analysis. Garcia said it’s “incumbent” on city leaders to craft strategic plans on addressing infrastructure needs and making the plans for road closures and paving easily accessible to the public.
“We have years, and if not years, I would say decades of deferred maintenance on road infrastructure,” he said.
He said he plans to take a similar approach to homelessness and substance abuse. City leaders over the summer spoke publicly about their plans to move away from relying on shelters and to embrace “micro-communities” with tiny homes. These issues are felt acutely across New Mexico — when volunteers conducting a “point in time” count of unhoused people documented a 10% decrease from 2024 to 2025, the report attributed the decline to a lack of volunteers running the count.
Addressing social issues like these require a different approach than aging roads, Garcia said, because the response has to be “organic.” He hesitated to “put a date” to when his office will produce plans on any of these issues and said he wants to work with city staffers and residents in 2026 to determine holistic responses to these problems.
“Before major investments are made, there needs to be strong buy-in from the residents,” he said. “We are going to be an administration that is engaging residents as we’re going through the decision-making process. They’re not going to be an afterthought.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_6616.jpg,,,2025-12-01 07:57:26.376274

Whether one thinks school district consolidations or mergers would be beneficial for Vermont or not is immaterial in regard to the fundamental issue raised by the Vermont school redistricting task force’s move to thwart the intent and requirements of Vermont law concerning the future of our pre-K-12 schools.
The task force has grossly abused its privilege as an appointed policy group by deciding to, essentially, disobey the law and thwart the process that our elected representatives designed for school reform.
Our elected Legislature and governor, with much research and then debate, set a policy direction for Vermont school governance, operations and finance. It is not in any way, the prerogative of this small group to take it upon themselves to thwart the process set forth in law, for reorganizing our educational system.

That thousands of people who purportedly came forth to voice concern or opposition to the law, is transparently the result of organized, concerted political activism.
While it is important to listen to and respect voices of concern, there is no reason per se to think that this is a “groundswell” representing the overall will of Vermonters as a whole. In fact, our 2025 Vermont Legislature and governor duly elected by Vermont citizens, set this policy into law. 
The Task Force, as well as “anti-merger” activists, in six months of activity, have generated through these actions an undue, large amount of worry, fear and anxiety over the idea of changing the way we do schooling.
As well, the task force itself has demonstrated a shockingly myopic narrow-mindedness regarding research on school reorganization and reform and organizational change — and also a  stunning lack of respect for the will of Vermonters, who have said that the status quo of our schools — educationally and financially — is no longer working and needs dramatic change, very soon.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention first used the term “AIDS” on Sept. 24, 1982, more than a year after the first cases appeared in medical records. Those early years of the crisis were marked by a great deal of confusion over what caused the disease, who it affected and how it spread.
But the naming itself – acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, which we now know is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV – was a milestone. How people talked about and named the AIDS crisis shaped how it was viewed and either fostered or countered a culture of stigma.
Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, for instance, conservative Christian leaders such as Rev. Jerry Falwell described AIDS as “God’s punishment” for sexual immorality. Many AIDS activists, on the other hand, also took up the importance of naming. Instead of being called “AIDS victims,” they preferred phrases like “people with AIDS” and “people living with HIV” to affirm their status as people rather than merely patients or victims.
As a historian of religion, sexuality and public health, I became interested in how moral and religious rhetoric shaped this global pandemic from the start. In my book “After the Wrath of God,” I trace how the AIDS crisis could not be separated from the broader cultural contexts in which it emerged, including the histories of LGBTQ+ people and the Christian right.
In other words, from the start, this medical epidemic was also a moral epidemic.
Before ‘AIDS’

	
The naming of AIDS in 1982 came more than a year after the CDC first reported cases of young, otherwise healthy men diagnosed with rare forms of cancer, pneumonia and other infections that occur in people with weakened immune systems.
CDC researchers searched for a connection and found that these men were “all active homosexuals.” This confirmed what many gay and bisexual men living in places such as New York City and San Francisco already knew: There was a mysterious illness affecting their community.
Early news coverage described a new “gay cancer” or “gay pneumonia.” Some medical researchers called it GRID – gay-related immune deficiency – or acquired community immune deficiency. When CDC leaders settled on AIDS instead, they wanted to acknowledge the prevalence of cases among many other groups, including heterosexuals.
Despite these efforts, however, this early association with homosexuality would stick.
In fact, the history of homosexuality was crucial to the very discovery of AIDS. Scientists have now shown that HIV circulated well before 1981, especially among intravenous drug users, many of whom were homeless. But unusual illnesses and deaths within this population largely went unnoticed.
Meanwhile, the modern LGBTQ+ rights movement had been picking up steam since 1969, when a police raid at the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar in New York City, set off a series of riots that prompted a new wave of LGBTQ+ activism. By the 1980s, queer and trans people asserted greater political and cultural influence.
This visibility and increasing cultural influence were crucial to the detection of this new disease.
Stirring ‘God’s wrath’

	
The early association of AIDS with homosexuality also ensured that this public health crisis would stir moral and religious debate.

In the 1970s, conservative Christian leaders had already warned the broader public about what they considered to be an epidemic of homosexuality. They argued that social acceptance of LGBTQ+ people was a sign of moral decline, and warned that if the United States did not stamp out this “moral disease,” the country would face the same fate as Sodom and Gomorrah, biblical cities destroyed by God.
In other words, the Christian right already had its own way to talk about homosexuality as an epidemic, as a threat to society itself. The AIDS crisis seemed to only confirm their belief in God’s wrath.
Medical and public health officials were not immune to this rhetoric. In the 1980s, at hospitals across New York, people readily referred to WOGS – the wrath of God syndrome. A physician at the Medical College of Georgia penned an editorial for Southern Medical Journal that asked whether AIDS fulfilled a biblical pronouncement about “the due penalty” for sexual sins and recommended conversion therapy for homosexuals.
In the White House, as historian Jennifer Brier has shown, President Ronald Reagan’s conservative advisers Gary Bauer and William Bennett formulated a strategy to fight AIDS that emphasized the moral righteousness of heterosexuality and abstinence outside of marriage.
They were frustrated to get pushback from the Reagan-appointed Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, a pediatric surgeon who had also become one of the leaders of the evangelical pro-life movement. He insisted that national AIDS policy focus on comprehensive sex education.

(The pamphlet sent to American homes in 1988 by the U.S. Surgeon General and the Centers for Disease Control, U.S. Public Health Services/National Library of Medicine via Wikimedia Commons. )
In 1988, Koop sent a mailer called Understanding AIDS to virtually every household in America. Conservatives balked at Koop’s approach, although he still prioritized abstinence for people who were unmarried as the best form of protection.
Bauer and Bennett complained that the flyer included information about condoms and described the risks of contagion through oral and anal sex. Phyllis Schlafly, the conservative Catholic crusader against feminism, abortion and gay rights, accused the surgeon general of trying to teach “safe sodomy” to third graders.
Beyond the Christian right

	
Not all conservative Christians understood AIDS to be God’s punishment for sexual sin. Many evangelical groups and Catholic leaders even pushed against that notion – yet still spoke of it in religious and moral terms.
Cardinal John O’Connor, the archbishop of New York, drew the ire of many AIDS activists when he spoke about AIDS at the Vatican in 1989. “Good morality,” he proclaimed, “is good medicine.”
Many Christians took more progressive positions. Southern Baptist ethicist Earl Shelp and chaplain Ronald Sunderland worked as research fellows at Texas Medical Center, where they first encountered people with AIDS. Together, they started one of the earliest AIDS ministry programs, which focused on helping gay men with AIDS without judgment.

And many queer and feminist Christian and Jewish leaders, including Jim Mitulski, Yvette Flunder and Yoel Kahn, forged queer-affirming and justice-oriented responses to the stigma of AIDS. They countered the idea that AIDS was a “gay disease,” but they also focused on how AIDS harmed populations that were often sidelined, including people of color, women and drug users.
What’s in a name?

	
Today, when I teach about the history of the HIV/AIDS crisis, my students tend to be confused by this early association with homosexuality. They associate AIDS with sub-Saharan Africa, which had become the epicenter of the pandemic by the 1990s.
Nevertheless, my students have grown up in a world where AIDS is far better understood. Thanks to the work of activists and scientists, far more people now know that HIV can be blocked by using condoms and sterile needles. Antiretroviral therapy has proven very effective in treating people able to obtain and tolerate the medicines.
Yet no matter how scientific or objective people hope to be, epidemics are shaped by culture. And studying that history helps us understand more about ourselves.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Washington state lawmakers next year hope to rein in law enforcements’ use of automated license plate readers amid revelations federal immigration authorities are using the data.
The readers are mounted everywhere from street poles to police patrol cars. They take pictures of vehicles and use artificial intelligence to analyze the data. Police can use the information, stored in a database, to track vehicles that could be tied to criminal investigations. 
At least 16 states regulate the readers. Washington does not. 
The technology has become increasingly common in Washington and across the country and is used not only by police, but also businesses and community groups.
Washington’s chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union is leading the charge to regulate the license plate readers here. The issue has taken on new urgency during the Trump administration’s campaign for mass deportations, said Tee Sannon, the organization’s technology policy program director.
A report last month out of the University of Washington found several local police departments authorized U.S. Border Patrol to use their license plate reader databases. And in other cases, Border Patrol had backdoor access without express permission. In some instances, police conducted searches on behalf of the federal agency. 
The findings raise concerns about compliance with state law limiting cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.
In a statement, the head of the Washington Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs acknowledged the concerns. Executive Director Steve Strachan attributed the issue to sharing permissions allowing the feds to access plate reader data unbeknownst to local police.
“We continue to remind our members to be aware of their system restrictions to ensure that their data is only shared consistent with Washington law and agency policy,” Strachan said.
Worries extend beyond immigration. 
Authorities in Texas this year searched thousands of the cameras, as far as Washington state and Illinois, in their search for a woman believed to have had a self-administered abortion.
Anxieties over public record access to data from the readers have already spurred some Washington cities to rethink using them.
The proposal
The legislation in Washington, which is still being drafted, wouldn’t ban license plate readers. It looks to put guardrails on them in two main ways. 
One is how long agencies can hold onto the data. Currently, the information can sit indefinitely, though police departments have internal retention policies. The standard for Flock, the leading company making the cameras, is to delete pictures after 30 days if the images have no value. 
“A lot of this risk goes away if you ensure that the data is deleted,” Sannon said. “It can’t fall into the wrong hands. It can’t be requested or misused if it’s just being regularly deleted.”
The draft legislation pegs the retention period at 72 hours, said the planned prime sponsor, Sen. Yasmin Trudeau, D-Tacoma. There would be exceptions, for example, if holding onto the data helps with investigating a violent crime.
Cities feel three days isn’t enough time. 
“If you are trying to investigate a crime and determine where a stolen vehicle is ending up, you may need more than 72 hours,” said Candice Bock, government relations director at the Association of Washington Cities.
Some states allow longer retention periods, for weeks or even months. On the other end of the spectrum, most data from readers in New Hampshire has to be purged within three minutes.
The other issue the proposal seeks to address is how agencies can share their data. The policy would prohibit departments from giving direct access to license plate reader databases, Sannon said. Agencies would have to get a search warrant to access data from other departments, she added.
Some local officials also see this as potentially problematic. Bock noted “criminals don’t stop at the city limits,” so data sharing between, for example, neighboring police agencies is key to the success of automated license plate readers. 
To Trudeau, the regulations seem like a “no-brainer.”
“It’s not anything crazy,” she said. “It’s just about making sure we’ve got a framework that people can respect.”
Trudeau compared it to legislation she spearheaded in 2024 to ban police hog-tying, when there was some consensus that a change was needed.
“When I’ve had conversations with Flock directly or law enforcement, I think most folks are like, ‘No, we want to operate, but we know there’s going to be a bill. We want to be involved in a bill. We understand that there should be a policy,’” she said. “So they’re all at the table in good faith.”
Conversations around the bill began before the UW report was released in October.
Flock didn’t respond to a request for comment.
Trudeau hopes to file the proposed legislation before the Legislature convenes for a 60-day session Jan. 12. The bill will then need to pass both the Senate and House before Gov. Bob Ferguson can sign it.
In 2019, lawmakers in Washington state put forward legislation to shorten the readers’ retention periods and limit their use, but the proposal didn’t gain traction. 
Similar discussions are expected next year in the Oregon Legislature. 
Public records concerns
Law enforcement agencies also want to see changes to state law on automated license plate readers. But their focus is on public disclosure of reader data through record requests.
A Skagit County judge last month ruled the pictures and other information the cameras capture must be made available through the state’s Public Records Act. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit against Stanwood and Sedro-Woolley. The cities have appealed.
Some cities, including Redmond and Lynnwood, have suspended their license plate reader programs in response to the ruling and immigration concerns.
Local jurisdictions worry they’ll be overloaded with public disclosure requests related to their license plate readers, and that public safety will be threatened by allowing anyone access to the whereabouts of anyone’s license plate, whether they’re connected to a crime or not.

“If somebody can request the images, the license plates through the Public Records Act, then there is no ability to control who is getting access to this and how they’re using it,” Bock said.
Police and city officials hope to exempt their reader data from disclosure under state public records law as part of Trudeau’s planned legislation. Bock hopes for something similar to the state’s treatment of red light cameras. Those images and the personally identifying information they capture aren’t releasable under state law.
Other states, including Florida, Nebraska and North Carolina, have exempted the data from their public records laws.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/license-plate-reader-1024x701.jpg,,,2025-12-01 07:57:26.376274

(Getty Images)The months-long political drama over possible Indiana congressional redistricting has snarled up campaign plans for some Hoosiers with U.S. House ambitions.
Indiana House members are returning to the Statehouse this week for debate over President Donald Trump’s demand for Republican-led states to draw more GOP-leaning congressional districts.
Uncertainty clouds whether such a plan will clear the Republican-dominated state Senate. Such has been the campaign ambiguity since August when Indiana became ensnared in the national redistricting debate.
“It’s definitely muddied the waters,” said Randy Niemeyer, who was the 2024 Republican challenger to Democratic U.S. Rep. Frank Mrvan and is considering a 2026 run.
Northwestern Indiana’s 1st Congressional District now held by Mrvan has been in Democratic hands since the 1930s. But it has trended more Republican in the Trump era and is seen as the easiest potential GOP pickup in the state.
The current 1st District takes in all of Indiana’s Lake Michigan shoreline areas, including all of Lake and Porter counties and part of LaPorte County. Many unofficial map proposals create a more Republican district by pairing Lake County — the state’s second-most populous — with numerous rural counties to the south and southeast.
The uncertainty of what map will be used for the 2026 election hangs over many campaign decisions, said Niemeyer, who is the Lake County Republican chair and a County Council member.
“It becomes a factor in fundraising,” Niemeyer said in an interview. “It becomes a factor in a ground game. You’re talking about a difference between covering two and a half counties and possibly 12 or 13 counties. What I’ve kind of been doing in my own consideration is, ‘All right, let’s build two business models and see what this looks like.’”
Republican hopeful faces unknowns
Similar troubles exist for candidates in what are now among solidly Republican districts.
Redrawing maps so that all nine of Indiana’s congressional districts favor Republicans would mean also carving up the heavily Democratic 7th District in Indianapolis now held by Rep. Andre Carson.
That could mean a chunk of Indianapolis going into the 4th District, where state Rep. Craig Haggard is challenging four-term U.S. Rep. Jim Baird for the Republican nomination.
Rep. Craig Haggard, R-Mooresville, speaks in committee on Jan. 23, 2024. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
Haggard said he’s spent most of the past two years traveling the district that spans from the western suburbs of Indianapolis more than a hundred miles north to the Kankakee River separating Lake and Newton counties.
“I’ve spent a lot of resources. I have volunteer coordinators in each of those counties,” Haggard said. “They could go away. It really could upend everything and then I have a very, very short time to start over again.”
Indiana’s candidate filing period for the 2026 primaries opens Jan. 7 and closes Feb. 6. Early voting is scheduled to start April 7 for the Republican and Democratic primaries on May 5.
So even though U.S. House candidates aren’t required to live in their districts, most serious campaigns for a congressional seat start months or years ahead of the filing period — especially with fundraising.
Haggard acknowledged some potential financial supporters were holding back until the district lines were finalized, but said he believed that was a small percentage.
The most recent Federal Election Commission reports show Haggard raised $49,500 during the three months ending Sept. 30, compared to Baird’s $70,610. Haggard’s campaign had about $117,000 in the bank, while Baird had $182,000.
Complications for Carson challenger 
George Hornedo has faced an even more complicated political landscape since May when he announced his Democratic primary challenge to Carson in the 7th District.
Hornedo says he is pressing on despite the prospect of the district being split up among perhaps two or three others to favor Republicans.

Hornedo, an attorney who was a staffer with Pete Buttigieg’s 2020 presidential campaign, decided to narrow his campaign team’s focus to northern Indianapolis, knocking on doors and making phone calls to both oppose redistricting and support his candidacy.
“Every ounce of volunteer energy, every phone banking shift, every hour canvassing, it was going to identify and support us for the campaign, but also educating neighbors with what’s at stake with redistricting and helping to enable them to take action,” he said.
Hornedo had an initial burst of fundraising success, collecting nearly $160,000 in the first three-month period when he announced his bid. That dropped to about $18,000 for the three months ending Sept. 30, leaving his campaign with about $43,000.
Carson, who has held the House seat since 2008, ended September with more than $600,000, having raised about $155,000 in the previous three months.
Hornedo said he is committed to a 2026 campaign regardless of how the redistricting debate plays out.
“I would organize in whatever the new district is, but I would continue to organize in the district as it is now — Indianapolis at large — because part of the reason I got into this race was talking about rebuilding the Democratic Party from the bottom up,” he said.
Carson’s campaign said it is running a coordinating effort “to support Democrats up and down the ballot.
“This year, that work has continued — and the congressman has also collaborated with local leaders to raise the alarm on redistricting,” Carson spokesperson Caroline Ellert said in a statement.
Democratic enthusiasm boost?
The biggest political change from the 2021 congressional maps drawn by Republicans after the 2020 census was strengthening the GOP’s hold on central Indiana’s 5th District following U.S. Rep. Victoria Spartz’s narrow 2020 general election win for her first term.
Spartz easily defeated Democratic candidates in the 2022 and 2024 elections, even after surviving a tight Republican primary last year.
No 2026 Republican challengers have emerged against Spartz as the redistricting debate has lingered.
But Democrats say they have stirred up animosity among voters with a redistricting push that they see as unfair.
“They want to know where the district lines are, but people are just paying attention to what’s going on and they’re stepping up,” said 5th District Democratic chair Terri Austin, a former state legislator from Anderson. “They’re stepping up in their activism. They’re stepping up to run for local office and they’re fired up. They really are.”
Mrvan challengers jumping in
Mrvan, the Democratic congressman from northwestern Indiana, told an anti-redistricting rally at the Statehouse in August that he planned to seek reelection next year “no matter what district they put me in.”
Mrvan argued Trump was pushing redistricting to help Republicans overcome unpopular policies and retain a narrow U.S. House majority.
“They are afraid, they are afraid to face voters,” Mrvan said during the rally.
A Mrvan spokeswoman did not return recent messages seeking additional comment.
The unknown makeup of the 1st District hasn’t stopped Republicans from entering the race to possibly challenge Mrvan.
Those who’ve already declared candidacies include Porter County Commissioner Barb Regnitz and Jennifer-Ruth Green, who got 47% of the vote in a 2022 loss to Mrvan.
Former state cabinet secretary announces congressional run

Green announced her new campaign in October, the month after she resigned as public safety secretary for Gov. Mike Braun’s administration. She has denied allegations of ghost employment and misuse of state property made by the state inspector general in a formal ethics complaint.
Green campaign spokesman Tim Edson said in a statement that Green “is receiving a lot of support from Republican activists, donors and Hoosiers across the Region excited to have an outsider, a conservative and a fighter who will stand with President Trump in this race.  We remain confident Indiana will redraw the congressional map to combat Democrats efforts to rig the game through gerrymandering and counting illegal immigrants in the census.”
The Regnitz campaign did not reply to messages seeking comment.
Some Republican legislators who oppose the redistricting push argue that it has taken focus away from supporting a GOP candidate against Mrvan.
Niemeyer said he would be making a decision soon about seeking a rematch against Mrvan and scoffed at the argument the redistricting debate hurts Republican candidates.
“We built a really legitimate campaign and not a single one of those people saying that lent a hand,” Niemeyer said. “I find it to be a very hollow statement and actually a statement that is trying to deflect what’s at play, because I doubt that they will help.”

All seven of Indiana’s current Republican U.S. House members have endorsed Trump’s redistricting call — despite not seeing what those new maps might look like.
Baird, the 4th District incumbent, said he would be running for reelection “no matter what the final map looks like.”
“I would hate to lose any of my constituents, but I also recognize how important it is for Indiana to get this process right so every Hoosier has a fair voice in Washington,” Baird wrote in an email.
Baird said he trusted the Legislature “to do what is right for Indiana and all Hoosiers.”
“Neither my staff nor I have been involved in drafting any maps,” Baird wrote. “That responsibility lies solely with the Indiana General Assembly.”
Haggard, the legislator from Mooresville challenging Baird, said he supported the redistricting push despite the impact on his candidacy.
“If I can’t handle this, I shouldn’t go to Congress anyway,” Haggard said. “… It hurts a campaign like mine but at the end of the day, I think that this is bigger than me.”

(Getty Images)Together, the people writing this represent six decades of Democratic political service in Indiana. We have served our state and country in a number of different roles — as members of Congress, U.S. Senator, governor, ambassador, state party chair, and co-chair of the 9/11 Commission.
 

These Democrats signed on to this commentary:
Joe Donnelly, Former Ambassador, US Senator, and Congressman (IN-02)
Evan Bayh, Former US Senator, Indiana Governor and Secretary of State
Lee Hamilton, Former 9/11 Commission Co-Chair and Congressman (IN-09)

Kip Tew, Former IDP Chair
Robin Winston, Former IDP Chair
Joe Andrew, Former DNC Chair and IDP Chair
Ann DeLaney, Former IDP Chair
John Livengood, Former IDP Chair


We have always worked to advocate for American ideals and values, sometimes in partnership with Republicans when it made sense for Indiana, and sometimes in competition with Republicans when we disagreed on a policy issue or an approach.
Targeting Congressmen André Carson and Frank Mrvan to gerrymander their districts before a mid-term election is dangerous, wrong and beyond the common sense Hoosiers traditionally show. These members, duly elected to represent their districts, work hard each day to listen to the needs of their constituents, solve problems and deliver for the families, workers, students, and seniors in their communities. They won their elections fair and square – and in the case of Congressman Mrvan – against well-funded opponents financed by the national donors.
Everywhere you go in this state, Hoosiers will tell you their biggest concern is the soaring cost of groceries, utility bills and healthcare. Indiana governors have the ability to call the General Assembly in for special legislative sessions for emergencies. The fact that the legislature is coming in early to redistrict instead of addressing real problems like Indiana’s affordability crisis, shows just how out of touch the GOP supermajority is with everyday Hoosiers.
Even former two-term Republican Governor Mitch Daniels has denounced this idea. Republicans should take heed of his statement that districts should make geographic sense, particularly if they attempt to split Marion County, which is represented by the dean of Indiana’s congressional delegation, Congressman Carson.
Competition is good for democracy, and it’s good for our country and state. It starts with healthy debates and leads to more balanced outcomes for all people. Hoosiers deserve a congressional map where every district is competitive and voters choose their representatives, not the other way around.
But the political insiders in D.C don’t want competition. They want to predetermine the results of the next election before the first vote is even cast.
We have all won elections. We have all lost elections. We have always accepted the outcome because we knew that at the end of the campaign it was the choices of Hoosiers that bestowed political power on us – not the parties that granted it before the votes were even counted. Hoosiers deserve a better government, and that starts with a politics that is fair and not rigged by people outside this great state.
We urge our fellow Hoosiers of all political viewpoints to recognize this blatant power grab to rig the 2026 midterm elections. Indiana’s legislature should not waste Hoosier taxpayer dollars on a purely political activity. Hoosiers need to make their voices heard now.

New auto assembly plants create thousands of new jobs and generally receive an enthusiastic welcome in Michigan, which prizes high-paying, blue-collar jobs. Economists say one assembly plant job leads to the creation of about four spin-off jobs, spreading wealth throughout the region where that plant is located.
Automakers have typically been among the biggest capital spenders in Michigan. But the latest headline-grabbing project, said by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to be the “largest one-time investment in state history,” is not an auto plant. And everyone hates it.
Well, maybe not everyone. But the announcement of a $7 billion-plus data center in Washtenaw County’s Saline Township has created an uproar among local officials and residents.  And it is slated to create only about 400 permanent jobs. It would be Michigan’s first hyperscale data center.

State Attorney General Dana Nessel has jumped into the controversy, asking the Michigan Public Service Commission to slow DTE Energy’s roll in fast-tracking a contract to provide electric service to the Saline Township center.
Massive data centers, which can cover millions of square feet and suck up enough electricity to power a large city, are being built all over the world to power artificial intelligence models that promise (or threaten) to change the way we work and live.
In Michigan, outrage isn’t just aimed at the Saline Township center, known as “Stargate,” being developed by Open AI, Oracle and Related Digital. Residents and environmental groups are mobilizing against more than a handful of data center projects across the state.
Kalkaska residents beat back a data center proposal in late November. And Howell Township has enacted a six-month data center moratorium because of residents’ pushback against them.

Opposition to data centers focuses on fears that they will lead to skyrocketing electric rates for nearby residents, dry up water supplies needed to cool the tens of thousands of tightly packed computer servers inside the centers and destroy the rural character of places where many of the centers are locating.
But the overarching worry about data centers is their role in powering a boom in potentially destructive artificial intelligence. AI’s backers cite a variety of potential benefits, including the ability to find cures for diseases, boosting worker productivity and powering tremendous economic growth.
AI also could wipe out humanity, not something desired in economic development projects.
Even the leaders of AI companies say they’re not exactly sure what they’re unleashing.

Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, has warned that the technology could spur massive fraud, create lethal bioweapons used by bad actors and free itself from human control. OpenAI is the creator of the wildly popular ChatGPT chatbot that can spit out answers to queries and mimic human writing.
And while some experts say AI could create new jobs we haven’t even thought of yet and might not displace all that many current jobs, others predict massive losses as many human functions are taken over by the technology.
Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates said earlier this year that he thinks humans won’t be needed “for most things” in 10 years.
It’s no wonder that just 17% percent of U.S. adults in a recent Pew Research Center poll said they think AI will have a positive effect on the country over the next 20 years.
Nevertheless, the builders of data centers and AI are pushing ahead, spending hundreds of billions of dollars on data centers in a battle for supremacy in AI, which they believe will bring them untold riches.
The so-called “Magnificent Seven” stocks—Apple, Amazon, Alphabet (formerly Google), Meta (formerly Facebook), Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla—make up more than a third of the S&P 500’s total market value. All seven companies are heavily involved in AI projects.
Massive AI spending is propping up a sluggish U.S. economy, leading to fears that an enormous AI bubble could burst and take down much of the rest of the economy.
And it’s possible that Michigan’s bet on data centers might not pay off. Those of us who have lived here for decades know that many of the auto assembly and parts plants state policymakers have worked to attract ultimately closed, due in part to work being outsourced to other countries.
And while it seems implausible now, something similar could happen with data centers. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and other AI pioneers say hyperscale data centers could go where none have gone before: to the moon.
“We will be able to beat the cost of terrestrial data centers in space in the next couple of decades,” Bezos said at a recent tech conference in Italy.
Moon-based data centers would run on solar power, which would be essentially free, Bezos said. Data center information would be beamed back to Earth.
That would be the mother of all outsourcing.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2115899404-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-01 07:57:26.376274
,Mississippi Today,2025-12-01 12:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Wicker and other lawmakers want congressional review of Trump’s military strikes on boats,Associated Press,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/12/01/wicker-review-military-strikes-boats/,Republican Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi says in a joint statement with Democratic Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island that the Armed Services Committee is looking into U.S. strikes on suspected narcotics boats in the Caribbean Sea.,"WASHINGTON — Lawmakers from both parties say they support congressional reviews of U.S. military strikes against vessels suspected of smuggling drugs in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean, citing a published report that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued a verbal order for all crew members to be killed as part of a Sept. 2 attack.
The lawmakers said they did not know whether last week’s Washington Post report was true, and some Republicans were skeptical, but they said attacking survivors of an initial missile strike poses serious legal concerns.
“This rises to the level of a war crime if it’s true,” Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said Sunday.
Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, when asked about a follow-up strike aimed at people no longer able to fight, said Congress does not have information that happened. He noted that leaders of the Armed Services Committee in both the House and Senate have opened investigations.
“Obviously, if that occurred, that would be very serious and I agree that that would be an illegal act,” Turner said Sunday.
Republican Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and its top Democrat, Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed, said in a joint statement late Friday that the committee “will be conducting vigorous oversight to determine the facts related to these circumstances.”
Meanwhile, President Donald Trump on Sunday evening while flying back to Washington from Florida, where he celebrated Thanksgiving, confirmed that he had recently spoken with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.
The U.S. administration says the strikes in the Caribbean are aimed at cartels, some of which it claims are controlled by Maduro. Trump also is weighing whether to carry out strikes on the Venezuelan mainland.
Trump declined to comment on details of the call, which was first reported by The New York Times.
“I wouldn’t say it went well or badly,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, when asked about the call.
The Venezuelan communications ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the call with Trump.
Turner said there are concerns in Congress about the attacks on vessels that the Trump administration says are transporting drugs, but the allegation regarding the Sept. 2 attack “is completely outside anything that has been discussed with Congress and there is an ongoing investigation.”
The comments from lawmakers come as the administration escalates a campaign to combat drug trafficking into the U.S. 
On Saturday, Trump said the airspace “above and surrounding” Venezuela should be considered as “closed in its entirety,” an assertion that raised more questions about the U.S. pressure on Maduro. Maduro’s government accused Trump of making a ”colonial threat” and seeking to undermine the South American country’s sovereignty.
After the Post’s report, Hegseth said Friday on X that “fake news is delivering more fabricated, inflammatory, and derogatory reporting to discredit our incredible warriors fighting to protect the homeland.”
“Our current operations in the Caribbean are lawful under both U.S. and international law, with all actions in compliance with the law of armed conflict—and approved by the best military and civilian lawyers, up and down the chain of command,” Hegseth wrote.
Trump said on Sunday the administration “will look into” the matter but added, “I wouldn’t have wanted that — not a second strike.” The president also defended Hegseth.
“Pete said he did not order the death of those two men,” Trump said. He added, “And I believe him.”
On Saturday, the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Republican Rep. Mike Rogers of Alabama, and the ranking Democratic member, Washington Rep. Adam Smith, issued a joint statement saying the panel was committed to “providing rigorous oversight of the Department of Defense’s military operations in the Caribbean.”
“We take seriously the reports of follow-on strikes on boats alleged to be ferrying narcotics in the SOUTHCOM region and are taking bipartisan action to gather a full accounting of the operation in question,” Rogers and Smith said, referring to U.S. Southern Command.
Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., asked about the Sept. 2 attack, said Hegseth deserves a chance to present his side.
“We should get to the truth. I don’t think he would be foolish enough to make this decision to say, kill everybody, kill the survivors because that’s a clear violation of the law of war,” Bacon said. “So, I’m very suspicious that he would’ve done something like that because it would go against common sense.”
Kaine and Turner appeared on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” and Bacon was on ABC’s “This Week.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/06122924/AP25030639147635.jpg,,,2025-12-01 07:57:26.376274

A mentor of mine always reminded me that when we look ahead and see all the work we need to do, we need to look behind us and see how far we have come. 
When I was in graduate school in the late 70’s,  institutions were the primary providers of mental health care. The limited community services that were available were largely funded through grants from the state and counties. 
In short, there was no mental health system.
Our system isn’t broken; we have spent the past few decades building the foundation of a system. 
There is now a wide array of community services for both children and adults that provide treatments and support and vary in intensity. This is largely due to a shift in 2006 to move services to Medicaid and MinnesotaCare and the subsequent passage of mental health parity laws. These are health care services and should be paid for by health insurance. 
The importance of housing, employment and education were not forgotten, and these important parts of our system also received increased funding. 
Ensuring that people are trained on mental health issues — teachers, police, etc. — was also important to ensure early identification and to decriminalize mental illnesses. 
Despite this progress, we continue to not meet the needs of people with mental illnesses and their families. 
The difference now, versus 30 years ago, is that we know what works — we know the solutions. 
Here’s how to move forward on building our mental health system. 

Invest in early intervention and engagement. As with any health care condition, early identification and treatment yields the best outcomes. The government has not fully funded early episode of psychosis programs despite the evidence that it prevents young people from developing a disabling condition. There is only one small grant program, which started this fall, that tries to engage people in treatment voluntarily instead of waiting until there is a full-blown crisis. Since 50% of mental illnesses develop by age 14, fully funding our children’s mental health system is important, and programs such as school-linked mental health eliminate barriers by going to where the children are. Routine mental health screenings are sometimes conducted, but there isn’t consistent follow-up. 
Create a robust and diverse workforce. There is a workforce shortage across the state, and our current mental health workforce lacks diversity. There are several programs designed to address the barriers — loan forgiveness, paying for supervision, paying for BIPOC mental health professionals to become supervisors — but the funding doesn’t match the requests. Creating a mental health and substance use disorder workforce office within the Department of Health would direct attention to this issue and support the wide array of people needed in our mental health system, including peer and family peer specialists. We also need a different level of case managers to ensure that people with more experience are assigned to people under commitment. 
Pay the true costs of providing treatment and supports. Low payment rates — especially under Medicaid, which is the largest payer for mental health care — make it difficult to expand services. Rates don’t come close to covering the actual costs. Increase the rates, end the Medicaid policy that won’t pay for care in psych-only facilities with more than 16 beds, and require more services to be paid for under private insurance (enforce parity!).
Separate out children’s mental health from child protection. While some progress has been made, families should not have to go through the child protection system to access residential care. It’s an incredible burden for them to have to do this, threatens their employment, and delays access to needed care.
Create a unified mental health crisis system. When people complain about the number of people with mental illnesses in our jails, we need to ask who brought them there. We need to have a mental health response to a mental health crisis. Every county is covered by a mobile mental health crisis team, yet the statewide funding is less than the budget of most of the individual cities’ police department budgets. We are seeing an increasing number of police departments establish their own teams or co-responder models. This leads to confusion, especially now with “988” the suicide and crisis hotline, raising important questions like, who does what?  And, does HIPAA cover data collected by city teams? Additionally, ever since the deadly use of force law changed, many police have been unwilling to transport people to the hospital unless the person willingly enters the vehicle. While there isn’t research on this, we surmise that more people may be ending up in jail because they were not brought to the hospital. Lastly, stop trying to develop separate crisis centers. Everyone goes to the hospital emergency department  when there is an emergency, so build psychiatric emergency department within existing EDs. 
Pay attention to the social determinants of health. We know that housing, employment and social connections are important to a person’s recovery. Yet funding is very limited. Restrictions on the use of the Medicaid waivers —no more than 25% of the people in a building can be on a waiver — and reliance on “group homes” (four bed homes) offer little choice and insufficient support to people with the most serious mental illnesses. Employment provides a reason to get up in the morning, but the only employment program for people with serious mental illnesses has limited funding. While clubhouses and community support programs help break the isolation so many people with serious mental illnesses experience, not every county offers this program. 

We could do a myriad of other things to build our mental health system. But I think back to President John Kennedy’s quote as he urged our country to close the institutions and to return people to their own communities with the “open warmth of community concern and capability.” 
He added: “It is to be hoped that within a few years the combination of increased mental health insurance coverage, added state and local support, and the redirection of state resources from state mental institutions will help achieve our goal of having community centered mental health services readily accessible to all.” 
That was more than 60 years ago, but I still cling to hope that we can continue to build our mental health system and provide effective and compassionate care and support.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/teenmentalhealth.jpeg,,,2025-12-01 07:57:26.376274

She is sore. She is tired. And she is alone. 
Oscarina and her husband escaped violence in Venezuela and moved 2,000 miles north to Missouri in 2023, seeking more stable housing and a better future for their daughter. Neither have permanent legal status in the United States, and when she learned she had a second child on the way, Oscarina wondered how they could afford to raise another baby. 
Eight weeks into the pregnancy, her husband was detained while delivering a DoorDash order. He was deported back to Venezuela a short time later. 
“All my pregnancy, I cried every single day,” Oscarina, who lives in Kansas City and asked not to use her name out of fear of deportation, told The Independent through an interpreter. 
When she went into labor prematurely earlier this month, her husband cried as he called in over video from Venezuela. 
When their daughter was born, he helped with night feedings. This time, there is no help. And what little money her family had saved up quickly disappeared during the deportation process. 
Now she lives in constant fear about what would happen if she gets detained.
There are days her oldest child doesn’t attend school because Oscarina worries she could be taken while walking her to the bus stop. 
She wonders what the point of the “American Dream” is. Her family suffered under Venezuela’s dictatorship, and in America she suffers, too. 
“I would like to go back to my country,” Oscarina said. “But my husband is saying that things are very bad there right now, and I don’t think it’s a good idea to bring both of the kids right now.” 
So they will remain separated. 
“I live in fear every day,” Oscarina said. “ … It’s too heavy to carry being by myself with my daughter and my little boy and not having my husband because he will always care for us. The fact that he doesn’t get to be with us, everything changed for us.”

Oscarina’s story is one of many shared with The Independent over the past month as women who are undocumented in Missouri navigate pregnancy, birth and postpartum without legal paperwork. 
Several community health care workers, doulas and nonprofits that work with immigrants and expectant mothers shared the struggles the families face. Few were willing to speak on the record, fearful that federal agents could target their offices or the federal government could restrict funding if they spoke out about their work with undocumented immigrants. 
The organizations located across Missouri shared stories of pregnant and postpartum women who’ve shuttered themselves in their homes. Many are facing labor or postpartum in isolation, their husbands deported and the fear of the same fate keeping them housebound, at times too afraid to seek medical care.
Since President Donald Trump returned to office in January, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has been increasingly visible on America’s streets, including in Missouri, sparking protests across the state and nation. Arrests have made headlines as videos circulate of ICE agents detaining parents at school drop-offs and arresting teachers, including inside a preschool. 
In rare cases, ICE has reportedly posted up outside maternity wards.
Under previous administrations, schools, hospitals and churches were considered sanctuary spaces where ICE was not allowed under almost any circumstances. That changed this year, raising new fears for families with young children like Oscarina.
“This is the worst that I’ve seen in many, many years,” said Eunice Cho, senior counsel at the ACLU National Prison Project.
Under former President Joe Biden’s administration, pregnant women were protected from ICE detention. While that policy remains in place, the ACLU earlier this year uncovered several examples of women who were either pregnant or miscarried while in federal detention centers. 
“The trauma it has on children and parents and families is heartbreaking,” Cho said. “And it’s completely unnecessary. These are families that have been living and working and contributing to our communities, often for years or decades.”
 ICE threats send mothers, children into hiding in Missouri

Neysha Reyes Cruz is one of a handful of bilingual doulas in Missouri. 
Through her company, Olas de Amor Doula Services, she has advocated for almost 90 women through pregnancy, birth and postpartum over the past three years. Of those 90, about 70 were undocumented, she said. This year, she estimates she’s stood in as the support person for about half a dozen women who gave birth after a close family member was deported.
Reyes Cruz, who is from Puerto Rico and moved to Missouri in 2016, often serves as an interpreter as well as a doula for her clients, the majority of whom give birth in hospitals. But in recent months, as the threat of ICE raids permeates her Kansas City community, she said her job has increasingly expanded into helping families with more than birth.
Neysha Reyes Cruz, a doula and interpreter in Kansas City, has helped several undocumented women whose husbands were deported shortly before or shortly after their baby was born. (Photo provided by Neysha Reyes Cruz).
The messages she gets from moms are often desperate. One recently asked Reyes Cruz if she could get her formula from the store after the mother said she saw ICE agents out on her street that day.  
Many of her clients skip non-crucial doctor’s appointments. Others miss WIC appointments or have been cut off from food stamps. She has a donation closet to help with clothing and baby supplies.
Instead of going to the pediatrician, many new moms instead call Reyes Cruz to ask if their baby is sick enough to warrant risking leaving the house. The child birth class she used to host in-person is now virtual because too many families feared driving to her.
“I have had moms that have withdrawn their kids from school and have just left the country so those kids never ended their school year. Mamas that were in situations where their partners became so depressed and anxious they started becoming abusive, and from there, having to find refuge for them,” she said. “This is the hardest thing, finding a refuge for a mama that is single, is pregnant or with maybe older kids, does not speak English and doesn’t have a prior family here.”
She encourages her clients to designate someone who is a citizen to get custody of their baby if they’re deported. One mom requested that Reyes Cruz be that person for her baby girl. 
“As a doula, I’m being pushed to support this community because they don’t feel safe with anyone else,” she said.
She fears the elevated stress thrust on these families is affecting their babies. Of the past 10 births she’s attended, five were babies born prematurely. 
Missouri still among worst states for infant, maternal health as new Medicaid cuts loom

Reyes Cruz’s experiences aren’t unique.
A health care provider in the Ozarks who was too afraid to speak on the record said she has Hispanic patients who fear coming into the clinic amid increasingly visible ICE raids around the country.
Other nonprofit workers shared the difficulties of helping parents obtain birth certificates for their newborn children so they could self-deport back to their home country. Legal aid groups help parents establish custody plans in case they are detained and their children are left alone.
Community health workers in urban centers of the state said they are doing more home health visits for pregnant and postpartum women who fear leaving the house, or who are waiting until later in pregnancy to see their doctors. Others help arrange Uber rides to get the women to their appointments. 
“I’m heartbroken for any woman who feels fearful to leave her home, especially to try to receive prenatal care,” said Laura Brandt, director of Pregnancy Help Center of South County in St. Louis.
She said her nonprofit serves anyone who walks through the door and doesn’t question their status.
“This is such a polarizing topic and people have a lot of really strong opinions going either way on the matter,” Brandt said. “Regardless of what your opinions are on a policy level, on a personal level, every human being is deserving of dignity and compassion and care.”
 Some families turn to self-deportation

In just a couple days, Monica is self-deporting. She purchased a one-way flight from Kansas City back to Chile, where she is from. Her 6-month-old son will be on her lap. 
Monica, who asked not to use her name because she is undocumented, moved to the United States on Mother’s Day last year, seeking better education opportunities for her son, who is 8. 
She learned she was pregnant a couple months later. She was sad to be experiencing a new life without her friends and family by her side. 
When she was less than two weeks postpartum, Monica said her husband became violent during an argument. She called her therapist, who reported the abuse to the police. He was arrested and deported back to his home country of Venezuela. 
Monica, who is undocumented, is self-deporting back to Chile with her 6-month-old and 8-year-old sons after her husband was deported from Missouri and she was left without the financial means to continue raising her children in the United States (Photo provided by Monica).
Now alone, Monica can no longer afford to care for her two children on her own. She delivers for DoorDash, and on each trip she fears being caught by immigration agents. Her fear is amplified now that she has a second child. What happens to them if she’s detained?
“Life got more difficult for me,” she said through an interpreter as her son babbled from his perch on her hip.
Tim Rudolph, a St. Louis-based immigration attorney for Hacking Immigration Law, said it’s not uncommon for people to self-deport in today’s political climate. 
He encouraged anyone considering self-deportation to talk with a lawyer first, noting that if someone has a child who is a U.S. citizen, they may have some legal paths to staying in the country if they want to stay. 
“Even though the government is saying ‘if you leave you can come back the right way, we’ll let you do it,’ that’s not often the case,” Rudolph said. “That tends to be what they say to get people out of the country, and a lot of times you’ll be barred from returning.”
While Monica doesn’t yet know if she’ll ever try returning to the U.S., her current vision of her children’s future has been shattered. While she still believes the move to America was worthwhile to attempt to give her children a more promising future, she feels some relief to return home to her parents and to leave the constant fear of deportation behind. 
“People need to be strong emotionally to come over to the United States,” Monica said. “Because even though the United States is a very great country full of opportunities, it can be very emotionally draining to be here with this situation.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2193563646-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-12-01 07:57:26.376274

“I don't want to see other folks hit the same roadblocks in their recovery journey,” said the Common Ground Recovery founder.

Timothy Farr knows the importance of having strong support after leaving residential treatment for people with substance use disorder: Now sober, he once faced addiction and homelessness.  
These days he is working to help bridge a gap in services for people facing the same challenges he did. 
Working on an initiative since August, Farr gained the help and resources from the Rutland community to launch Common Ground Recovery. The sober-living nonprofit organization gained 501(c)(3) status and Level 1 preliminary certification from Vermont Alliance for Recovery Residence, and Farr opened the first Common Ground Recovery house on Nov. 7.

The pilot house is a three-bed men’s recovery residence in Rutland City, implementing a peer-run, independent, sober-living community based on the Oxford House Model. There’s an “extreme shortage” of sober-living residences in the state, Farr said, so he hopes the organization gains support to open more housing and expand offerings to more people in recovery. 
“We’ve had some pretty decent grassroots support,” Farr said. “It’s a necessary addition into making Vermont a safer, sober and more equitable place for everybody.” 
The state has recovery residences geared toward higher levels of care and monitoring, but there is a gap in Level 1 residences — which are peer-run houses like Common Ground Recovery — that help people remain in a sober-living community and transition to permanent housing, said Candace Gale, director of community relations for Vermont Foundation of Recovery.
Tracie Hauck, director of Turning Point Center of Rutland, said she is not aware of any Level 1 residences in the Rutland area, and Common Ground Recovery helps provide continuity, independence and longer access to recovery community resources while also freeing up space in residences for people in need of more intensive care.

Advocates have long voiced concern over the lack of “stepdown” facilities in the state, or residences that provide less intensive, long-term housing and resources after people receive short-term, inpatient treatment for substance use disorder and exit more structured residential rehabilitation facilities. 
The lack of recovery communities that help people transition to living independently and rebuild their lives can mean people return to the same circumstances that led to addiction, increasing rates of relapse and recidivism, said Chadd Viger, chief executive officer of the Rutland County-based residential treatment organization Recovery House Inc.
“There’s such a need for sober living once folks leave a residential treatment facility,” Viger said.
Farr said he found the next step in the recovery process was missing after he transitioned from residential treatment services in Rutland County through Recovery House Inc. and completed his stint at the Vermont Foundation of Recovery’s Rutland house.  
Farr said people in recovery often face a big barrier after exiting higher-level care residences, as landlords often deny housing due to low credit scores or past interactions with law enforcement. The area’s affordable housing organizations were also unable to help him secure housing when he was leaving Vermont Foundation of Recovery’s Rutland house, Farr said. So, Farr decided to create the resource he needed. 
“I had no luck. It looked like I was going to be homeless on October 1. I had nowhere to go,” Farr said. “It was born out of necessity, but was also born out of inspiration, because I don’t want to see other folks hit the same roadblocks in their recovery journey.”
Marc Miller, a board member for Common Ground Recovery who works in the recovery community, said he often sees recidivism because resources often drop off after people leave treatment or incarceration.
“I think we have a state that thinks it’s incredibly progressive when it comes to human services, but the infrastructure just simply isn’t there,” Miller said.
He hopes Common Ground Recovery is able to create an environment  where “people have an opportunity to get on their feet rather than fall back into the system,” Miller said.

For those inclined to bet on sports, the earliest days after a state launch can be the only time they actually have a statistical edge on the house if they take advantage of promotions.
 Celebrity bets

Multiple sportsbooks announced opening-day celebrations, including Caesar’s Sportsbook, DraftKings and Fanatics.
At the closest casino to Columbia, the Isle of Capri Boonville, former Chiefs quarterback Trent Green will make a stop on his trip to promote Caesar’s-branded sportsbooks. Green will first make a bet at Horseshoe St. Louis, then travel to Boonville, and finally hit Harrah’s Kansas City later in the day, where he will meet up with another Chiefs legend, former running back Christian Okoye.
Although Isle of Capri Boonville will not have its own retail sportsbook, the casino is welcoming members to place mobile sports bets while visiting.
DraftKings has assembled a star-studded cast of characters for its launch event at The Palladium in St. Louis.
Missouri sports legends, including St. Louis Rams receiver Isaac Bruce, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Tony Gonzalez and St. Louis Blues right-winger Brett Hull, will place celebrity bets for the sportsbook’s launch event.
DraftKings’ event will also feature Missouri House Speaker Jon Patterson.
Ex-Royals outfielder Alex Gordon will be promoting Fanatics’ launch by placing a ceremonial first bet at Ameristar Casino Hotel Kansas City. Fanatics also has a retail sportsbook across the state at Ameristar Casino Resort Spa St. Charles.
 Late sportsbook shifts

Two sportsbooks left the Missouri market in the previous weeks. The partnership between ESPN and PENN Entertainment, which created ESPN Bet, announced on Nov. 6 it would disband by Dec. 1, which means Missourians won’t be placing bets there.
However, since PENN still has its mobile-betting license, it will rebrand as theScore Bet, which is based in Ontario.
PENN will also rebrand its retail sportsbooks in two physical casinos, the River City Casino and the Hollywood Casino in St. Louis.
Steve Bittenbender, a gambling analyst for Gambling.com Group, says the move likely won’t change much for consumers.
“It would be like Kohl’s buying Target, and on a certain date, Target is rebranded to something else,” Bittenbender said. “It’s basically a rebrand. A very expensive rebrand.”
Customers who had previously downloaded the ESPN Bet app won’t even have to get a new app — it will be changed to theScore Bet automatically.
The second mover is Underdog Sports, which originally won one of the state’s nine mobile betting licenses. It also announced it would no longer operate a traditional online sportsbook in the state earlier in November.
Instead, it will focus on prediction markets in the same vein as Kalshi and Polymarket that aren’t taxed or heavily regulated by states, according to FOX2Now.
 Last-minute early sign-up promotions, revenue projections

Here are some promotions bettors can still receive by signing up to various apps before the launch:
• DraftKings: Sign up and receive $300 in bonus bets, without a deposit required.
• BetMGM: If your first bet loses, receive bonus bets back equal to up to $1,500.
• FanDuel: Sign up and receive $100 in bonus bets, then up to $400 in bonus bets once you place your first bet of $5 or more.
• Caesar’s Sportsbook: Bet $5, get $150 if you win, plus five more profit boosts on future bets.
These promotions all require you to gamble the bonus bets again, and win, before they can be cashed out. If you miss the pre-launch registration, many sportsbooks will still have promotions, but they will likely be smaller.
Experts will be eyeing this first month of gambling closely to see what the Missouri handle will look like.
“The next six weeks will be fascinating to watch for operators and for customers, just to see how explosive the Missouri sports betting market is in actuality,” Christopher Boan of BetMissouri.com said. “I think it’s important to watch these first couple months, especially, because you’ve got NFL, you’ve got NBA, you’ve got a bunch of stuff that people want to bet on right away.”
BetMissouri projects the state’s overall handle (total bets placed) to be $65,652,274 during the first week, and $262,609,095 during the first month of operations. The total will be key for policymakers who could look to adjust taxes, regulations and more depending on the total handle. Missouri takes 10% of the sportsbooks’ adjusted gross revenue.
Boan expects the raw betting figures to be big, as revenues in other states around Missouri continue to rise.
“There’s a very strong interest in sports betting in the Show-Me State,” Boan said.

(Stadtratte/iStock Images). The Trump administration is dismantling departments, agencies and services that promote the well-being of America and its citizens — doing just the opposite of what the Preamble to the Constitution so clearly states is its purpose.
What has happened to the promise of putting “America First?”
It has been supplanted by tariffs, trying to settle foreign wars, deploying the military in major American cities and seeking retribution by prosecuting perceived political enemies.
The Preamble to the Constitution clearly lays out what putting America First means— what should be the preeminent priorities of the president and his administration, Congress, as well as the other branches of government.
If you haven’t revisited it lately, what better time to do so than now to be reminded and to focus on every word.
“We the people of the Unites States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution of the United States of America.”
Look at what is happening in the federal departments overseeing health, justice, defense and education — core, pivotal departments in preserving, promoting and protecting the general welfare of America and its citizens. We all should be very concerned and feel very vulnerable.
What is the future of this nation? What will be the quality of our life and that of future generations of Americans?
What will happen should the majority of us lose faith and believe that our Constitution and its preamble no longer have value or hold sway?
Good and strong countries decay and die because of the attacks from within. This happens especially when caring citizens no longer believe things will change or think their involvement and intervention will be meaningless.
But left unaddressed and untreated, the rot just creeps and spreads after the initial wounds have been inflicted. Often going ignored and unnoticed, becoming the norm over time.
Is that what is happening as we sit by and watch the Department of Health and Human Services gutted of the policies, research and the qualified committed health professionals with years of expertise?
Is that what is happening as we sit by and watch the Department of Justice become first in line to break all the rules, disregard due process, ignore facts and truths as it carries out vengeful vigilante justice?
Is this what is happening to the Department of Defense (newly named the Department of War) as it gets rid of or loses many of the most experienced and battle-ready officers among its corps.
Maybe the best example of this problem is the Department of Education, which we have counted on to guide and support equal opportunities for all of our children to receive a quality education by establishing, implementing and overseeing the best standards and practices.
Will our children receive a better education when policies and procedures are left solely up to individual states?
Even before the current effort to get rid of the Department of Education, many states including Missouri, are promoting or adopting measures that are not in the best educational interests of all its children. In addition to underfunding public schools and teacher salaries, taxpayers dollars are being used to support tuition or some form of financial support for private schools.
Underpaying teachers and unjustifiably banning books have become commonplace.
Look at all the other symptoms of decay and erosion — the fraying around the edges — occurring that are not promoting the general welfare.
Why is the average American struggling to make ends meet, while the wealthy and powerful become even more powerful and wealthier through tax breaks and additional business opportunities?
What is the purpose of putting Medicaid and Medicare benefits and services at risk for those Americans who qualify to receive them? Yes, the ineligible recipients and any waste should be gotten rid of. However, it does not mean that the qualified should be denied their legitimate benefits.
The dismantling and redesigning of departments, agencies and services are destroying the very purpose and tenements the Preamble outlines, and the Constitution directs how they are to be carried out.
But is the Preamble to the Constitution, and the Constitution itself, becoming little more than lofty words in a historical founding document that many of us read long ago, or maybe not at all?
It will not become alive and implement itself.
It will not hold itself accountable.
“Let not any one pacify his conscience by the delusion that he can do no harm if he takes no part, and forms no opinion. Bad men need nothing more to compass their ends, than that good men should look on and do nothing. He is not a good man who, without a protest, allows wrong to be committed in his name, and with the means which he helps to supply, because he will not trouble himself to use his mind on the subject.”
Some version of this quote from John Stuart Mills, the 19th century English philosopher, has been used during dark and defining times. It is worth consideration and taking to heart for the times we are in.
We cannot be pacified with not speaking up, fighting for, and insisting that our Constitution and all its meaning be upheld.

(Henry Redman | Wisconsin Examiner)A rule to protect Wisconsin’s cleanest waterways from being harmed was finalized last week over the objections of Republican legislators and allied lobbying groups. 
The rule highlights the ongoing dispute between the Legislature and the administration of Gov. Tony Evers over the level of oversight legislators are allowed to have over the administrative rulemaking process. Earlier this year, the state Supreme Court issued a ruling that curtailed the ability of the Legislature to kill administrative rules. 
The new rule, which was published in the state’s administrative register Nov. 24 and is set to go into effect July 1, is the result of a decade of wrangling. 
In 2015, the U.S. EPA updated the Clean Water Act’s antidegradation regulations — which guide how states are required to protect high quality lakes and rivers from pollution. 
Dozens of creeks, rivers and lakes are classified as outstanding resource waters and exceptional resource waters under Wisconsin’s administrative code and will be protected as “high quality waters” under the new rule. Additionally, a body of water can be considered a high quality water if it has contaminant levels that are better than an established statewide standard. 
“This means that a waterbody can be high quality for one or more parameters, even if it is impaired for a different parameter,” Laura Dietrich, manager of the Department of Natural Resources’ water evaluation section, said in an email. “For example, a waterbody may be impaired for phosphorus, but chloride levels are better than the chloride water quality criterion. The waterbody would be considered high quality for the purposes of considering new or increased discharges of chloride, but would not be high quality for phosphorus.” 
Under the new rule, the DNR will be required to conduct a review before regulated entities are allowed to discharge new or increased levels of contaminants into the water body. Discharges may be allowed if found to be necessary through a “social or economic analysis.”
The rule’s finalization is the end of a process that began in 2023 and has included multiple public hearings and the input of several legislative committees. 
Last month, the Assembly committee on the environment voted 4-2 to request modifications to the rule, but the DNR and the Evers administration moved forward with finalizing the rule anyway. 
That action has angered Republicans who want more say in the process. 
“Representative government has been taken away and we now have rule by king,” Rep. Joy Goeben (R-Hobart) said in a statement. “We don’t want a king and the current path forward is dangerous.”
Lobbying groups have also complained about the rule’s finalization. 
Scott Manley, a lobbyist for Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, the state’s largest business group, told Wisconsin Public Radio that the rule going into effect is “terrible from a representative government standpoint.” 
Erik Kanter, government relations director with Clean Wisconsin, told the Wisconsin Examiner that he thinks the rule represents the DNR finding a solid compromise between environmental and business concerns and that WMC was involved in the entire process through an advisory committee. 
“DNR engaged the stakeholder group regularly over the 30-month process it took to put the rule together at the DNR, and so WMC, along the way, had all the opportunity, and certainly took the opportunity, to make their thoughts [known] on how to put this rule together,” Kanter said. “It almost feels like it was never going to be enough for WMC.” 
Kanter also said that because the rule aligns the state with the EPA regulations, the state doesn’t have a choice if it wants to retain regulatory authority over its own water. 
“Wisconsin has to do this. We have to update our own rules to comply with federal changes to the Clean Water Act,” he said. “There’s no two ways about it if we want to maintain our delegation authority and have state regulators in charge of administering the Clean Water Act. It’s something we have to do.”
The alternative would be for the federal EPA to administer the act in Wisconsin, he said. 
“I think a lot of folks in the business community wouldn’t want EPA and the federal government breathing down their neck,” Kanter said. “And so this delegated authority situation is, I think, better for everybody.”

(Photo by Richard Ross via Getty Images)The 2025-26 Educator Supply and Demand Report by the Center for Educator Recruitment, Retention and Advancement represents an exciting step toward providing every South Carolina student with access to the highest quality education.
Its release comes only a few weeks after the South Carolina Department of Education reported record improvements on school report cards.
The double dose of good news in K-12 education is far from coincidence. Instead, it affirms South Carolina students excel when they are provided with the resources they need, and no resource is more important than staffing every classroom with a highly qualified educator.
For the first time this decade, the number of vacant educator positions to start the school year has declined for two consecutive years, with the 706 reported vacancies this year representing a 56% decline from the record high vacancies reported in 2023.
This year’s number of vacancies is also more than 300 fewer than last year, a figure especially notable as the data this year includes participation from three additional school districts not included in last year’s report.
The lower vacancy number is also not a result of a reduction in overall teaching positions, with the report showing the second-highest number of total employed positions this decade.
Improving education in SC requires supporting teachers and elevating good leaders

The reduction in vacancies demonstrates how sustained policy efforts can make a meaningful positive impact on teacher supply.
The downward trend is almost certainly correlated with the continued upward trend in educator salaries, with this year’s starting statewide minimum teacher salary of $48,500 representing a 35% increase compared to 2020.
Numerous districts across the state have built on the record investments made by the General Assembly, led by Charleston County increasing starting pay to nearly $65,000.
In recent years, the General Assembly has also passed several significant policies to improve educator working conditions, starting with providing daily unencumbered time and paid parental leave to educators earlier this decade and culminating in the governor signing the Educator Assistance Act into law in May 2025.
If implemented successfully by districts, these policies will continue to enhance efforts to recruit and retain educators.
However, even the good news in the Supply and Demand Report does not offset the fact that educator vacancy rates still remain too high in South Carolina.
While this year’s reduced number is encouraging, that trend provides limited solace or benefit to the tens of thousands of students experiencing diminished opportunities due to hundreds of classrooms lacking a certified teacher.
The impact of stubbornly persistent educator shortages is especially acute for students entitled to additional academic support through an individualized education plan (IEP), as more than 25% of the vacant classroom teaching positions statewide are in special education.
Additionally, the vacancy rate remains far too high in essential education service provider positions such as psychologists and speech language pathologists.
Shortages in these areas exist nationally, meaning South Carolina is in a race to secure teaching talent.
As a result, the optimism provided by this year’s Supply and Demand report should be matched or exceeded by a sense of urgency to make South Carolina the most attractive place for educators to work in the Southeast.
Such an effort requires comprehensive efforts by state and local leaders.
At the state level, the General Assembly must achieve Gov. McMaster’s long-standing goal of ensuring every teacher in the state is paid no less than $50,000.
The General Assembly should also start the work of creating “career ladder” compensation pathways, a policy recommended by the 2023 Teacher Recruitment and Retention Task Force based on promising results for similar programs in states like Texas and North Carolina.
Improved working conditions for educators may be even more important than compensation in order to fully eliminate educator shortages.
Efforts in this area must start with addressing the rise in persistently disruptive and dangerous student behaviors that undermine learning and too often result in physical harm to both educators and students.
Regardless of the salary offered, an educator that is consistently being struck at work is unlikely to persist in the profession, yet nearly one quarter of the members of Palmetto State Teachers Association report that a student referred to administrators for a violent behavior is returned to the classroom on the same day.
Local districts also have important roles to play in improving educator working conditions, starting with ensuring that statewide policies like the Educator Assistance Act, unencumbered time requirements, and class size caps are implemented with fidelity.
School leaders should also carefully evaluate what is necessary and essential work for teachers in order to eliminate tasks beyond the scope of an individual’s employment contract, activities that thousands of educators across the state are routinely required to complete without any compensation for their work.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/teachers-desk-e1732570434859-1024x764.jpeg,,,2025-12-01 06:56:26.373488

Easter enrolled in a long-term care nursing program at an Oklahoma CareerTech center while attending an Oklahoma City-area high school with the hope of eventually earning a bachelor’s degree in nursing. As the daughter of a single mother, the 19-year-old said she was always worried about the cost of education.

“I was really scared to take out student loans after I graduated, and with this it has all been so fine,” she said. “They’re so financially supportive here. I’ve never taken out a loan or had any financial strain and I instantly got a job. I started working at Bethany Children’s Hospital as a senior in high school and now I’m becoming a (licensed practical nurse) for free. … To me, that stability was worth more than anything.”
As Oklahoma employers struggle with shortages of certified nursing assistants – mirroring a national trend – Easter is one of hundreds of high school students that have completed an Oklahoma Department of Career and Technology Education program aimed at filling that gap. Through the program, students earn nursing certifications that can lead to employment opportunities or serve as a bridge to other health care professions after they graduate. 
Certified nursing assistants often perform tasks at a patient’s bedside such as helping with bathing, walking from room to room and taking vitals. But experts say the ongoing national shortage, due in part to recruiting struggles, is jeopardizing the quality of care patients receive. 
To help bridge the gap, all 29 of CareerTech’s technology center districts, and most of their 67 campuses, offer certified nurse assistant training in the form of both full-time high school and adult programs as well as short-term, workforce and economic development programs, said Lara Morris, the agency’s program manager for health and science education. The program costs about $114.8 million a year to operate and is funded by federal and state dollars.

High school students, who pay no tuition, spend half days at their local technology centers for the programs. After completion, some students, like Easter, are able to take advantage of “bridge” programs to earn the next level of nursing certification through CareerTech programming.
Addressing a nationwide nursing shortage 
Emily Coppock, the vice president of clinical excellence at the Oklahoma Hospital Association, said high turnover and fear of violence against health care workers can be a deterrent to working in the field. 
Early education is crucial to recruitment and retention, she said. 
A 2024 workforce survey report from the Oklahoma Hospital Association revealed that 13.1% of unlicensed nursing staff positions are vacant, and there is a 52% turnover rate. The turnover rate is so high because many of these people pursue a higher level of nursing or a different health care field, Coppock said. 
“Physically, we just don’t have the people to fill those gaps that are going to be left by baby boomers retiring,” she said. 
Steven Buck, president and CEO of Care Providers Oklahoma, said certified nursing assistants are the “backbone” of care in long-term care facilities, but retaining them can be a struggle. The organization represents and advocates for residents and employees of those facilities.
“They are the individuals who are most engaged with residents, making sure that their quality of life is addressed, providing care, providing service,” he said. “And they do this diligently, and do it across the state, and do it in a very heroic manner.”
Part of the difficulty in retaining certified nursing assistants is pay because the long-term care industry has to compete with retailers and fast food chains, Buck said. Increasing this pay is something Buck said his group is advocating for at the Capitol.

Nursing assistants, on average, make just over $16 per hour in the state of Oklahoma, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Oklahoma’s home health and personal care aides make around $13 per hour, licensed practical nurses make $26 per hour and registered nurses make about $41 an hour. 
In general, most of these nursing assistants are employed in long-term care or home health providers and they are vital to the industry, Buck said. 
Some of Oklahoma’s major hospital systems, including Mercy, Integris and University of Oklahoma Health, said programs like CareerTech’s that catch students in high school and provide hands-on, clinical experience are helpful to fill employment gaps. 
Buck said the state is “on the cusp of something commonly referred to as the silver tsunami.” 
“There are going to be just, from generational cycles, a tremendous number of people emerging into that era of life where they will need enhanced care,” he said. “And at the same time, there are going to be fewer caregivers available. So I applaud CareerTech for investing the time and energy to recruit these CNAs. We desperately need them, and we need them to stay committed to the field.”
Skills learned now will lead to jobs down the road

In his classes, Hukill said he’s learning skills such as CPR, medical terminology, proper hygiene and use of personal protective equipment.
“I personally love being hands on, and I know a lot of people love being hands on,” he said. “It helps a lot of people learn and it definitely does give us kind of a step up from what I think most health classes or whatever you would have in high school, or even some undergrad, college stuff isn’t as hands-on.”
A total of 1,446 students graduated from the program in the 2023-24 school year, according to an agency spokesperson. Data from the most recent school year was not available. 
Nearly 350 of these students reported they were employed in a job related to the program one year after completion, according to data provided by CareerTech. Another 1,030 had opted to continue their education, whether at CareerTech or elsewhere. 
Brent Haken, director of Oklahoma CareerTech, said the agency determines what programs are offered based on need throughout the state, not “wants.” Because of this, health care and manufacturing jobs have become the agency’s priority for workforce training programs.
“These are sophisticated programs, and the curriculums are based on feedback from the actual industry that has input,” he said. “The curriculum that we provide to students is customized to meet the needs of the industry.”
High school students do not pay tuition for the CareerTech programs offered in their district, so local property taxes offset the costs, an agency spokesperson said. Most technology centers generally receive 30% of its funding from state and federal dollars, with the rest being voter-approved property taxes.

Patience Melchor, 18, a student at Indianola High School taking classes at the Kiamichi Technology Center in McAlester, said she’s already using the nursing assistant certification she earned at a long-term care facility in her area.
Melchor wants to become a registered nurse and specialize in labor and delivery, but she said she isn’t sure if she’ll go straight to college or enroll in another CareerTech program first. 
“Every Wednesday we have a skills day, so we wear our scrubs and come into the lab and put our skills to test on the mannequins, or even sometimes each other,” she said. “We learned how to do bed baths on the mannequins, and we practice blood pressure and vital signs on each other and stuff like that. Then we go to clinicals towards the end of the year and those are really fun because you actually get to go to a clinic or a nursing home, and it was really fun to actually get to work on a real person.”

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Roughly one month after State Sen. Dan McKeon of Amherst was cited for “public indecency” over an alleged groping incident, state lawmakers are still undecided on how the Nebraska Legislature ought to respond.
The Unicameral’s Executive Board, which is in charge of handling disciplinary procedures within the Legislature, has met at least once in a closed session to discuss the situation, but it is unclear whether anything was decided.
The chair of the Executive Board, State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, told the Examiner he was considering scheduling another board meeting during Thanksgiving week to discuss McKeon, but officials said no meetings were scheduled.

McKeon was issued a misdemeanor citation by Nebraska State Patrol in late October after investigating an allegation by a legislative staffer attending an end-of-session party this spring. The Patrol received a report in early September that McKeon allegedly “made inappropriate contact with her buttocks with his hand, over the top of her clothing,” Patrol spokesman Cody Thomas said.
Kathleen Neary, the attorney representing the woman making the allegation, said that since the news broke “a surprising number” of people working inside or associated with the Legislature have reached out to offer their support.
“While I have handled many, many cases of sexual harassment over the years, I am truly shocked at the outpouring of support for my client,” Neary said in an email.
The Examiner is aware of the alleged victim’s name but is not publishing it because it is the policy of States Newsroom and the Examiner not to identify people who say they have been abused unless they wish to talk publicly.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
McKeon has made several statements about the incident since the citation was issued, including a July 28 letter he sent to the staffer, and a broader statement through his attorney Perry Pirsch. In those statements, McKeon acknowledged the incident occurred but denied the woman’s allegations, describing the incident as a “light-hearted exchange” that he argued did not qualify as public indecency.
Pirsch said McKeon “made a single remark — a joke — to a staff member about her planned trip and hoping she and her husband would receive a ‘Hawaiian lei,’ or words to that effect, and he then patted her on the back.”
“It was meant in jest, and nothing about his action was in any way sexually charged or lewd, just a bad pun,” Pirsch said in the statement.
McKeon is a registered Republican who was elected to the officially nonpartisan Legislature in 2024, replacing former State Sen. Fred Meyer of St. Paul. McKeon’s biographical page on the Legislature’s website highlights that he has been married for 30 years and has four children.
Gov. Jim Pillen and other state officials have called for McKeon’s resignation, but McKeon has said he will not resign.
State Sen. Teresa Ibach of Sumner, vice chair of the Executive Board, confirmed in October that members of the committee were looking into the situation separately from the criminal investigation but said the group hadn’t yet reached a conclusion.
It is unclear whether the Executive Board has decided anything with regard to McKeon. Clerk of the Legislature Brandon Metzler said his office had received no recommended actions from the board as of Nov. 24.
Typically, legislative committees are not allowed to vote in private sessions, but Metzler said some “administrative” exceptions might apply to the Executive Board. Measures regarding legislative processes — such as a recommendation for censure or a formal reprimand — must happen through a public vote, but Metzler said Hansen as chair could initiate some administrative actions on his own.
Metzler said his office would be notified of any formal meetings, including closed sessions, but that wouldn’t keep the board from holding an informal meeting.
State Sen. Myron Dorn of Adams, a member of the Executive Board, said board members have been advised by legal counsel to be cautious in their public statements about the situation. This is because they don’t want to inadvertently do something that could impede the Patrol’s ongoing investigation, Dorn said.
McKeon is expected in Lancaster County Court Dec. 10, authorities said.

An all-hands-on-deck effort, tens of millions in funding and a breakthrough herbicide are slowing but not halting a destructive force steadily enveloping the best sagebrush left on Earth.
The post Inside Wyoming’s fight against cheatgrass, the ‘most existential, sweeping threat’ to western ecosystems appeared first on WyoFile .","POWDER RIVER BASIN—Brian Mealor scanned the prairie east of Buffalo, but his mind drifted west to a haunting scene in northern Nevada. 
In the burn scar of the Roosters Comb Fire, a single unwelcomed species had taken over, choking out all competitors. Mealor saw few native grasses or shrubs, scarcely a wildflower. 
Not even other weeds.
“Literally everything you see is cheatgrass,” Mealor recalled of his June tour of the scar. “I just stood there, depressed.”

Mealor already knew plenty about the Eurasian species’ capacity to decimate North American ecosystems since he leads the University of Wyoming’s Institute for Managing Annual Grasses Invading Natural Ecosystems. But he was still shocked walking through the endless cheatgrass monoculture taking over the 220,000 once-charred acres northwest of Elko. 
The same noxious species, he knew, is steadily spreading in Wyoming.
The ecological scourge made Silver State officials so desperate that they were planting another nonnative, forage kochia, because it competes with less nutritious cheatgrass and offers some nourishment for native wildlife, like mule deer. 
“They’ll just die, because there’s nothing there,” Mealor said. “That’s why we have to do stuff. Because we could turn into that.”

Scientists, rangeland managers and state and county officials are doing everything in their power to prevent Wyoming from becoming another landscape lost to cheatgrass. There’s a powerful new herbicide that’s helping. And funds enabling the spraying of hundreds of thousands of acres are being secured and raised. Yet, Wyoming is still losing its cheatgrass fight, and ultimately far more resources are needed to turn it around.
“Let’s not kid ourselves,” said Bob Budd, executive director of the Wyoming Wildlife and Natural Resource Trust. “The magnitude of the need is utterly staggering. We’re talking hundreds of millions of dollars over the next decade. That’s daunting.”
Budd voiced that warning Tuesday while addressing a statewide group that focuses on bighorn sheep, which depend on seasonal ranges being invaded by cheatgrass. A recent study co-authored by Mealor underscores the need to act soon to protect Wyoming’s wildlife. UW researchers concluded that cheatgrass, which is only edible in spring, could cost northeast Wyoming’s already struggling mule deer half their current habitat in the next couple of decades.

On Nov. 6, the Sheridan-based professor joined fellow academics, biologists and volunteers on a field trip to a mixed-grass prairie. Like the Nevada burn scar, this was a Wyoming landscape on the mend from wildfire. In fact, it wasn’t a grassland until last year. 
Before Aug. 21, 2024, the ground where they stood had been considered the best of what’s left of northeast Wyoming’s sagebrush biome. 
Transformation
A lightning storm that sparked a conflagration abruptly ended that era. Over the course of two days, the House Draw Fire tore a 10-mile-wide, almost 60-mile-long gash into the landscape, inflicting over $25 million in damage. In a fiery blink, the native plant community mostly disappeared. 
Once-prized sagebrush within roughly 100,000 acres of the burn area is basically gone, a worrisome loss of habitat for the region’s already struggling sage grouse. What grew back isn’t a monoculture, like in Nevada. Native species are easily found. But portions of the Powder River Basin’s rolling hills are now dominated by big densities of cheatgrass and Japanese brome, another invasive annual grass. Without mature sagebrush shrubs to compete with, there’s reason to believe the invaders, which flourish with fire, will expand their grip. 
“It’s not like you have a fire and all of a sudden you’re just completely covered with cheatgrass,” Mealor said. “There’s a lag.”

The Johnson County Natural Habitat Restoration Team is throwing everything it can at the fire scar to try to prevent invasive grasses from taking over. Armed with $12 million in state funds, crews will aerially spray some 120,000 acres with a cheatgrass-killing herbicide. Aerial sagebrush seeding is also underway on 3,000 acres of burned-up sage grouse nesting habitat. And there are even funded plans to build hundreds of simple erosion-controlling Zeedyk structures to protect the wet meadows within the fire scar. 
Yet, on a broader scale, Mealor is a realist about the immense challenge of keeping cheatgrass and its noxious counterparts at bay in Wyoming, let alone enabling sagebrush to stage a comeback — a costly, complicated feat. 
“If we were talking about a 25,000-acre fire here and there,” Mealor said, “it would be a little different.” 
About a half-million acres of northeastern Wyoming burned in 2024, the state’s second-largest fire year in modern history. Wyoming lawmakers agreed to carve out $49 million for wildfire recovery grants statewide, less than half of Gov. Mark Gordon’s requested amount. Optimistically, Mealor said, the awarded sum might be enough to treat a million acres. That sounds significant — it’s half the acreage of Yellowstone. But cheatgrass is spreading just about everywhere in a state that spans 62 million acres.

“If you think about it from a statewide level, it’s not a lot,” Mealor said of the funding. “That’s not an attack. I’m not downplaying the importance of the money that was set aside by the Legislature for this. It’s a lot of money. But it’s also not enough.” 
The governor, who’s a rancher by trade, has voiced the same concern. Pushing for $20 million in cheatgrass spraying funds during the Legislature’s 2024 budget-making process, Gordon acknowledged Wyoming is “losing the battle” against invasive annual grasses. Lawmakers ultimately agreed to $9 million, less than half the requested amount, according to the budget. 
‘Best of the best’
The incursions that cheatgrass, Japanese brome and fellow invasives medusahead and ventenata are making into Wyoming rangelands are significant because of what’s at stake. The Equality State is the cornerstone of what remains of the sagebrush-steppe biome, a 13-state ecosystem vanishing at a rate of 1 million-plus acres per year.  
“Half of the best of the best is in Wyoming,” said Corinna Riginos, who directs the Wyoming science program for The Nature Conservancy. 

In 2020, the U.S. Geological Survey, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies completed a conservation plan to proactively restore the United States’ declining sagebrush habitat.

The Lander-based scientist is spearheading a Camp Monaco Prize-winning project that seeks to safeguard the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem from cheatgrass. The flanks of the ecosystem, such as the Golden Triangle, southwest of the Wind River Range, contain some of the most expansive unbroken tracts of sagebrush remaining on Earth. Distribution maps show that almost all of those areas are in Wyoming. It’s no coincidence that the same places also host remarkable biological phenomena, like the world’s largest sage grouse lek and longest mule deer migration. 
Riginos’ research is focused on defensive measures to catch and kill cheatgrass early on, when it exists at low levels. Keeping the invasion out of core tracts of sagebrush, she said, is a more efficient use of funds than trying to shift heavily contaminated landscapes back to what they used to be. 
“Maybe we live with what they are, we cope with it, rather than trying to recover from it,” Riginos said of cheatgrass-dominated areas.

Within Wyoming, invasive grass experts don’t have to go far from the world’s most unsullied sagebrush stands to find heavily infested landscapes. In June 2024, Riginos toured cheatgrass treatments in the Wind River Indian Reservation’s Washakie Park area. Although they stood about 40 straight-line miles from the Golden Triangle, scientists, wildlife managers and weed experts on the tour were surrounded by hillsides purple-hued from cheatgrass. 
“You have to respect it, as an organism,” Riginos said. “The adaptability and just kind of sheer ability to get a toehold and take over is pretty remarkable.”
Cheatgrass gets its name from its ability to “cheat” surrounding vegetation out of moisture and nutrients. Its mechanism for success is essentially a head start. It germinates in the fall and starts growing in cold temperatures. Then it overwinters, matures, throws off prolific amounts of seeds and dies by midsummer when native grasses and forbs are much earlier in their life cycle.

On top of the advantageous life cycle, the West’s ever-increasing, climate-driven wildfires help cheatgrass flourish. When a cheatgrass-infested area burns and becomes more cheatgrass dominant, it’s more prone to burn again, creating a vicious feedback loop. 
Giving cheatgrass yet another advantage, research has shown the plant in North America adapts well to different locales. That trait enables it to flourish in a wide range of temperatures and moisture conditions across the West, Riginos said.
“I feel that this is the most existential, sweeping threat to our western ecosystems.” Corinna riginos
“I don’t want to see the West become a wasteland of cheatgrass, I really don’t,” she said. “I feel that this is the most existential, sweeping threat to our western ecosystems. It really concerns me.” 
Closing in
All those traits have enabled an impressive, though foreboding, expansion. Since its introduction from Europe in the 1800s, cheatgrass has spread to all 50 states and parts of Canada and Mexico. There are signs it’s not slowing down. Rangeland ecologists have detected an eightfold increase in cheatgrass across the Great Basin since the 1990s, according to the National Wildlife Federation. 
Simultaneously, sagebrush-dominated landscapes have sustained a decline. A 2022 U.S. Geological Survey report found that an average of 1.3 million acres are being lost or degraded every year. That’s an area larger than Rhode Island.
Although the spread of Wyoming cheatgrass hasn’t been as overwhelming as in lower-elevation, drier western states, the invasion has, and continues to be, successful. A whitepaper distributed by the Wyoming Outdoor Council in the state Capitol during the 2024 funding fight reported that invasive annual grasses already affect 26% of the Equality State’s landmass, which pencils out to over 16 million acres.

Historically, Wyoming land managers believed that much of the nation’s least-populated state was too high and too cold for cheatgrass to gain much ground. But the climate has tilted in its favor, according to Jeanne Chambers, an emeritus U.S. Forest Service research ecologist who has studied cheatgrass for decades.
“Cooler temperatures, especially those cold nighttime temperatures, used to keep cheatgrass at bay,” Chambers said. “But now that things are warming up and people and livestock and animals are all over the place, the propagules — the seeds — are getting everywhere.” 
As a result, slightly lower-elevation reaches of Wyoming, like the Bighorn Basin, are seeing more and more cheatgrass, she said. The same goes for where the salt desert transitions into sagebrush in the state’s southwestern corner.   
“Those areas are pretty vulnerable,” Chambers said.

Wyoming specialists in those communities corroborate the claims.
“Cheatgrass is moving into our county, primarily on the south end — but it’s not exclusive to the south end,” Sweetwater County Weed and Pest Supervisor Dan Madson said. “There are hot spots throughout the county invading mule deer, antelope and elk habitats, as well as sage grouse core areas.” 
Some of the encroachments are well north into the Green River Basin and Red Desert, noted sagebrush strongholds. North of Rock Springs, north of Superior and in the Seedskadee National Wildlife Refuge are all places being actively invaded, Madson said.  
Sweetwater County is scaling up its response, Madson said. The county is spending about $750,000 to spray nearly 12,000 acres of cheatgrass this year and plans to treat more like 15,000 acres in 2026. 
But money is a limiting factor. Wyoming landscapes have been the recipient of many millions of federal dollars, including from the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which have complemented the state’s contributions.

Still, the pace of infestation statewide and in Sweetwater County far exceeds the total resources available. 
“We could easily, easily triple that [15,000 acres] in a year,” Madson said, “and still have enough to do for the rest of my career.”
Funding issues aren’t only due to federal government turmoil. One potential pot of $11 million that would have been directed toward spraying evaporated when the Wyoming Senate opted to forgo a supplemental budget. 
“That money got lost,” said Budd, at the Wyoming Wildlife and Natural Resource Trust. “It actually hurt some parts of the state that were doing a very good proactive job, managing to keep cheatgrass down.”
‘Defending the core’
The upper Green River Basin is one example of a landscape where cheatgrass advances have been reversed. Its remoteness, harsh climate and high elevation helped, but those factors alone didn’t prevent a slow incursion of the virulent vegetation early in the century. By 2014, for example, hues of red and purple — hallmarks of cheatgrass — were painting the ridges rising over Boulder Lake. 
The Sublette County Weed and Pest District fought the invasion with repeated treatments. In 2018 alone, some 30,000 acres of the western front of the Winds were aerially sprayed. It worked. 
By the summer 2020, no cheatgrass was being detected at Boulder Lake, once a hotspot, District Supervisor Julie Kraft said. Nowadays, she said, no major problem areas remain in Sublette County.
In August 2019, a recreational shooter hit an exploding target and sparked the Tannerite Fire, which ripped across the pictured ridge on the north end of Boulder Lake. Afterwards, cheatgrass that was already in the area grew in thick where the sagebrush once stood, but the mountainside was subsequently treated and today the invasive grass occurs only in trace levels. (Mike Koshmrl/WyoFile)
Kraft even felt “good” about the future of her cheatgrass fight, expressing uncommon optimism for those grappling with an organism overtaking so many places. 
“A couple of years ago, I might not have said the same thing,” Kraft said. “But with this new tool, and particularly because of the influx of money that came [during] the [Biden] administration, it allowed us to do so much more.” 
That new tool is an herbicide, Indaziflam. It’s a product, also known by its trade name, Rejuvra, that provides far more enduring protection against cheatgrass than any previous chemical treatment. It works by attacking the seedbank and shallow root structure of cheatgrass, while not infiltrating the soil deep enough to kill perennial native grasses and plants like sagebrush. 
“It depletes it down until there won’t be a seedbank of cheatgrass anymore,” Kraft said. “We’ve seen that on our sites. Year one, you can go out and grab handfuls of cheatgrass seed off the top of the soil. Year two, you can’t find those handfuls anymore. By year three, you can’t dig [cheatgrass seeds] out of the bottoms of sagebrush.”
Sublette County, a stronghold of the sagebrush biome, has fared better than other parts of Wyoming at keeping cheatgrass at bay. Still, patches can be found here or there, like this pocket overlooking Half Moon Lake in March 2025. (Mike Koshmrl/WyoFile)
The June 2024 outing that drew Riginos, the Nature Conservancy scientist, to Washakie Park along the east slope of the Winds included a stop at an experimental Indaziflam treatment plot. 
Although a mix of the herbicide had been misted over strips of cheatgrass nearly four years earlier, its effect remained obvious and unmistakable. Curing, purple drooping brome blanketed untreated strips, and native green grasses filled the niches between. 
“It’s holding still,” said Aaron Foster, Fremont County’s weed and pest supervisor, who led the cheatgrass treatment tour on the reservation. “It’s been holding now for four growing seasons. Pretty impressive.”  
Indaziflam is a relative newcomer to Wyoming’s cheatgrass-killing battle. The Environmental Protection Agency didn’t clear it for use on rangelands until 2020. Some federal authorizations came even more recently, with the Bureau of Land Management approving its use in July 2024, after years of urging from western states including Wyoming. 
“With this approval, Indaziflam will be eligible for application on 18 million acres of BLM land in Wyoming,” Gordon said in a press release, noting the policy change would have been “even more welcome” if BLM had made the announcement before states and counties were planning their spraying season.  
Judicious spraying
Out of necessity, Wyoming’s weed and pest districts and federal land managers are extremely strategic about where to put Indaziflam. It’s notoriously costly. Typically, time in the air is the biggest expense in aerial weed spraying work. But that’s not the case with the Envu-produced chemical. At Washakie Park, Foster reported paying $42-$43 per acre in product alone, adding up to about triple the cost of the helicopter. 
Kraft, in Sublette County, didn’t mince words about why Rejuvra’s so pricey. 
“It was a specialty herbicide used on specialty crops — almonds, I believe,” Kraft said. “They found out it worked on cheatgrass and now they have this western monopoly on this herbicide that works great. It’s expensive, and it goes up every year.” 
A Wyoming sales representative for Envu stood behind its breakthrough chemical’s high per-ounce cost. Compared to competing herbicides that need to be sprayed more often, in the long term Rejuvra is a bargain, David Collins said. 
“It’s actually the cheapest product to utilize,” he said. “You’re applying it once instead of every year or every other year, and you’re also saving on application cost.”

With limited resources, Fremont County’s spraying plan is to focus on swaths of the landscape that haven’t been extensively invaded: the Absaroka and Winds foothills toward Dubois and the Red Desert are two examples. But the “core problem area” — the cheatgrass-infested county center, which has lots of human disturbance — is considered a much lower priority, Foster said.  
“I think you have to kind of accept that we’re going to have cheatgrass forever.”Aaron foster
“I think you have to kind of accept that we’re going to have cheatgrass forever,” he said. “And areas like that are going to be impacted by it most severely forever, too.” 
Out where the House Draw Fire burned, the Johnson County restoration team is planning to spend big on Indaziflam — spraying burned areas that are now grasslands and unburned sagebrush to the tune of $9.3 million, consuming more than three-quarters of its state grant.    
Ultimately, those tending the fire’s scar opted not to spray immediately. Instead, they took a breath, collected data on where cheatgrass and Japanese brome now dominate and where native vegetation grew back.

“If we were to spray in the black, without knowing that any of the perennial vegetation was going to survive, it could have just been bare ground for four or five years,” said Jaycie Arndt, a University of Wyoming assistant research scientist. 
Now, more than a year after the House Draw Fire burned, its scar also hosts big concentrations of some native grasses, too. Western wheatgrass and blue grama were two species that also surrounded the weed scientists and landowners on their recent tour. 
Healthy native grasses can be one of the best defenses against cheatgrass.
“Sometimes the focus needs to be more on maintaining and increasing our perennial grasses and forbs as competitors,” said Chambers, the longtime Forest Service researcher. Cheatgrass, she added, is “naturalized” into a lot of western landscapes and is “always going to be there on one level or another.” Retaining native vegetation helps maintain resiliency to the attack.

The House Draw Fire recovery plan also calls for facilitating the return of the ever-depleting sagebrush biome. Ultimately, the state sunk $2.5 million into aerial sagebrush seeding — a technique that’s never been used in Wyoming. 
“This whole thing was an experiment,” said Todd Caltrider, a terrestrial habitat biologist with the Wyoming Game and Fish Department. “I looked for literature on aerial seeding for sagebrush in the Northern Great Plains, and there wasn’t any.” 
Caltrider spoke from a private land monitoring plot southeast of Buffalo, where sagebrush seedlings, reaching a few inches skyward, could be seen sprouting from the soil. They were among the cherished few. Results were worse than anticipated, with seedlings growing back at an average rate of one plant per acre. 
A tiny sagebrush plant, likely the result of aerial seeding, grows off the prairie within the House Draw Fire scar. Although land and wildlife managers will attempt to restore burned reaches of the sagebrush biome in the Powder River Basin, they’ll face a long road. After the first year of aerial seeding, monitoring discovered only about one seedling per acre on a landscape that could become dominated by invasive grasses. (Mike Koshmrl/WyoFile)
Even without cheatgrass to compete with, sagebrush comes back painstakingly slow. Individual plants can take decades to mature. But after a wildfire, the ecosystem evolved to recover even more slowly than that: Wyoming big sagebrush takes as long as 200 to 350 years to return to dense stands of mature plants, research has found. 
“If that’s the case, of course, we’re not seeing any [recovery],” Mealor said. 
The UW weed scientist’s feet lingered in the burn scar of what was once the Powder River Basin’s best sagebrush. Because of the House Draw Fire, it might functionally be a grassland for the rest of his life. The hope, of course, is that it won’t be a sea of cheatgrass.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)A big thumb’s up to state Rep. Molly Jenkins, the first Republican lawmaker to have the courage to publicly proclaim that the bizarre shenanigans of Oklahoma’s Board on Legislative Compensation stink to high heaven.
The Coyle lawmaker waded into the fray last week, challenging the elected leaders of her own party while in the process backing Attorney Gentner Drummond into a corner.
She’s demanding that Drummond issue an opinion on whether the nine-voting member board violated the state Open Meeting Act by bucking tradition and conducting business behind closed doors to discuss pay for lawmakers elected in November 2026.
Get out the popcorn. 
We’re all about to see if Drummond again sides with the good ol’ boy system that has ruthlessly proven over the past few weeks that they’re willing to do whatever it takes to get what they want, consequences be damned. Or we’ll see if the Republican interprets the law in such a way that restores public trust in how our government functions and upholds the level of transparency all Oklahomans should expect from governing bodies.
Because this soap opera that’s been playing out since October raises questions about the ethics of legislative leaders that control the agenda in the Capitol. 
Oklahoma lawmakers have given the governor, House Speaker, and Senate President Pro Tem, the power to appoint this board, which meets on the third Tuesday in October in odd-numbered years, to set the salary of future lawmakers. 
As someone who has sat through these board meetings over the years, let me tell you, they’re  normally a dull group. They watch a presentation that compares legislative pay to that of other states in the region. They discuss it publicly – sometimes in excruciating detail – to make sure they understand, and then vote. 
One year, the board, annoyed at lawmakers’ incompetence, cut their pay. But for the most part these are uneventful affairs.
But this year, setting legislative pay has been a bad melodrama. 
It turns out House Speaker Kyle Hilbert appointed a lobbyist to serve on the board — in clear violation of state law. But nobody, including apparently the Attorney General’s Office, which is supposed to ensure this board follows the law, noticed it the first two times they met.
The fact that James Leewright was a lobbyist and ineligible to serve mysteriously came to light after the board twice refused to increase legislative pay. Unsurprisingly, Leewright had been a lead proponent of pay hikes for the people he lobbies.
Under state law, this board can’t meet after the third Tuesday in November. The Friday before the deadline, Hilbert’s office abruptly declared Leewright ineligible and the board posted it was meeting for the third time and would reconsider all its votes.
Hilbert instead appointed Krista Ratliff, who serves as president and CEO of FISTA Innovation Park, a public-private partnership near Fort Sill in Lawton. Her group was at the Capitol during the last session promoting a new 3D-printed rocket propulsion system and fuel company.
Then, Gov. Kevin Stitt and Lonnie Paxton in a similarly opaque fashion used the opportunity to remove three board members who “coincidentally” voted to hold legislative pay flat at $47,500 a year. Those three men also insisted on holding discussions about legislative pay publicly, much like their predecessors had.
Stitt appointed Charlie Hannema, a public relations professional who used to work for him in the Governor’s Office, to replace Robert DeNegri. He also appointed Bill Kern to replace Brian Jackson.
Not to be outdone, Paxton, who publicly expressed displeasure with not getting a raise, dumped Gary Unruh in favor of Leslie Walker. Paxton said Unruh was unable to attend the meeting.
The new board of course cowardly refused to have a public discussion about pay, instead adjourning into the metaphorical smoke-filled room that has long defined insider dealings. We’re not even sure who exactly attended the executive session. Meeting minutes likely won’t be available for two years because the board won’t meet again until 2027. Meeting minutes for most state boards, which convene much more frequently, are available in a matter of weeks.
After the meeting, the board chair said the executive session allowed the members to discuss compensation more freely. The board cited a provision of law that allows public bodies to convene behind closed doors for the purpose of  “discussing the employment, hiring, appointment, promotion, demotion, disciplining or resignation of any individual salaried public officer or employee.” 
Huh. I always thought voters hired and fired lawmakers, not a board of political appointees eager to give their buddies a raise. Why else would we be holding elections?
Probably surprising nobody, this rigged board came back and boosted legislative salaries by 15%. They raised pay by $7,400 a year to $54,900 for a four-month job. They also doled out increased stipends for over a dozen leaders in the House and Senate. In all, this board increased the burden to taxpayers by $1.3 million a year.
This is not how boards and commissions are supposed to work. If leaders don’t get their way, they shouldn’t be allowed to randomly boot members in the middle of the process and appoint people more friendly to their cause.
So it’s refreshing that Jenkins is pushing back.
“Public service should never be about the money; it should be about sacrifice,” she said. “You can never pay a true public servant enough. But you can absolutely overpay a worthless politician.”
To clarify, we’re hardly paying poverty wages, even though we’re one of the most poverty-stricken states. In the Oklahoma City metro, the average person makes slightly over $58,000 for a year of work. Total compensation for state lawmakers not leadership is currently $72,869, including base salary, per diem payments, benefits and state retirement contributions. Oklahoma’s legislative salaries and per diem were already the second highest in the region at $60,828 for a four-month session. Only Colorado paid more at $63,914. Oklahoma lawmakers in leadership positions make more.
The legislative raises come as nationally consumers are increasingly dissatisfied with the economy following a record-setting government shutdown, slower hiring and inflation.
But while Jenkins showed up to represent us all, the problem is I don’t think Drummond has the intestinal fortitude to do the same.
His own attorney greenlighted this closed-door meeting, and before the ink had time to dry on Jenkins’ demand for Drummond to weigh in on the legality of the meeting, his office was already shouting from the rooftop that the meeting was legal.
So yeah, I think we all know how this is going to go.
Drummond, after all, wants to be governor.
Thanks to Jenkins, we’re all going to learn what Drummond stands for. 
Is he someone who believes voters employ lawmakers and that Oklahomans deserve transparency? Or is he someone who is willing to look the other way when, as Jenkins put it, things “don’t pass the smell test”?

As blazes expand to higher elevations, the impacts cascade downstream.
The post In burned forests, the West’s snowpack is melting earlier appeared first on WyoFile .","As the American West warms due to climate change, wildfires are increasingly burning in higher-elevation mountains, charring the watersheds where the region’s vital snowpack accumulates. 
A new study has found that in the immediate aftermath of fires across the region, the snowpack disappears earlier in burned areas. This change can threaten forest health and affect the downstream farms, cities and species that rely on the snowpack for their water, according to other research.
Scientists who study the effects of wildfires on the snowpack and streamflows are finding that the story is complex and nuanced. The impacts can vary greatly across the West’s diverse ecosystems and topography. Plus, each wildfire burns differently, so the severity of the blaze is another critical factor. 
While streamflow volume typically increases after a wildfire, the peak flows come earlier in the season, and the water may be clogged with sediment that can harm wildlife and water infrastructure. 
The new study, published in the Sept. 17 issue of Science Advances, used satellite data to track when the snowpack disappeared each season and examined how that timing changed after a fire burned through forests. The research also concluded that warming temperatures due to climate change will further accelerate post-fire melting. 
In the first year after a fire, the researchers found that under average winter conditions, snow melts earlier in 99% of the snow zone. “Postfire snow cover loss is more extreme in relatively low-elevation, warm environments compared to that in high-elevation, cold regions,” wrote the researchers from the Colorado School of Mines and the University of Colorado Boulder’s Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research.
The loss of the forest canopy due to a fire can actually increase snow accumulation on the ground below because scorched trees, which are missing branches and needles, intercept fewer falling snowflakes. But opening up the canopy changes the flow of energy in the forest by exposing the underlying snowpack to more solar radiation that can melt the snow.
Wildfires also cause soot and darkened debris to fall on the snowpack, which reduces its reflectivity, allows more heat to be absorbed and leads to quicker melting. Burned forests are also more susceptible to wind, which can further erode the snowpack.
“It’s basically just a big energy balance puzzle, but it seems like that increase in sunlight and decrease in the reflectivity of the snow are both leading to (an) earlier snow disappearance date,” said lead author Arielle Koshkin, a doctoral candidate in hydrologic science and engineering at the Colorado School of Mines. “Even if we do see more snowfall in the forest, it’s not overriding those energy balance changes.”
The study notes that previous research has found that the acreage of Western forests burned in the seasonal snow zone increased by up to 9% annually between 1984 and 2017, with the biggest rise in burned area occurring above an elevation of 2,500 meters (8,202 feet).
“Fire is burning higher and higher in elevation, which increases this overlap between where burned forests are and where it snows,” Koshkin said.
Stephanie Kampf, a professor of watershed science at Colorado State University who wasn’t involved in the study, said the findings are “pretty consistent with prior research,” showing that snow disappears earlier after a fire and that lower-elevation locations with more “transitional” snowpacks are more vulnerable. “This study shows it really nicely with a big dataset,” Kampf said. 
Climate change speeds up melting
Looking ahead, the authors project that post-fire melting will accelerate further as the West gets hotter due to rising atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases. If warming increases by 2 degrees Celsius — something that’s possible by the middle of the 21st century under some emissions scenarios — “73% of the snow zone would experience more extreme earlier postfire snowmelt compared to historically average conditions,” according to the paper.
“Under two degrees [Celsius] warming, the areas that already showed large changes are going to show even larger changes,” Koshkin said. “That warming is going to really have [an] impact on those warmer snow climates. So think maritime, Cascades, Sierras, comparative to the higher, colder, Rocky Mountain West.”
Previous research has also looked at what happens to the snowpack after a fire and found that the snow disappearance date moves up four to 23 days. Some of those studies have used ground-based observations, but the papers typically focused on one to three fires. Other research has examined snowpack readings from the automated SNOTEL network, but those snow sensors are usually placed in gaps in the forest canopy and may not capture the diversity of the West’s landscapes.
This new study relies on images captured by the MODIS instruments aboard two satellites to provide a westwide look at wildfire’s effects. Currently, satellites cannot measure the water content of the snowpack, known as the snow water equivalent. But repeated satellite imagery can detect whether snow is present on the ground, allowing researchers to measure when the snowpack disappears during the year.
“I was really interested in seeing if we could leverage remote sensing to look at it on a pixel-by-pixel scale across the whole Western United States to really try to understand, are we seeing the same responses in the Pacific Northwest as in Colorado?” Koshkin said. 
Each pixel in the MODIS satellite imagery represents a square on the ground with 500-meter (1,640-foot) edges. That’s a somewhat coarse resolution for measuring the snowpack, which can vary dramatically over very short distances, but the satellites provide daily or near-daily coverage. 
While satellite data offers broad coverage of the region, it has significant limitations. 
“The satellites can’t really peek underneath the forest canopy,” said Anne Nolin, a professor in the geography department at the University of Nevada, Reno, who wasn’t involved in the study. (Koshkin is a former student of Nolin’s.) “The other issue is that the satellite data can’t measure snow at times when there’s rain occurring or anytime there’s cloudiness. And so if you have a rain-on-snow event that’s changing your snowpack, which we’re having more and more, and which we would anticipate to occur more frequently, then you’re probably missing short-term changes in snowpack.”
Nolin said that the satellite-based estimates of the snowpack were “likely to be inaccurate in places where you have remaining forest, and especially in low-elevation snow zones and under warmer winter conditions.” That’s because previous studies have found that in warmer forests, the snow melts off under the canopy early, but it’s retained in the gaps between the trees, so the algorithm used to process the satellite imagery can overestimate the amount of snow in the pixel. “There’s less snow there than you think,” Nolin said. 
Stark regional differences
Elevation, temperature, burn severity, vegetation type and the amount of incoming solar radiation are among the drivers that explain when the snow disappears. The variability of these factors across the West may help explain why previous studies have found such a wide range in the timing of the snow disappearance date. 
“Everywhere we looked was disappearing earlier, but there were these kind of hotspots that disappeared way earlier,” Koshkin said. “I think the disruption in streamflow from these earlier melting-out pixels will be much more significant in Oregon, Washington and California.”
Wildfires had the biggest impact on the snowpack during the first five years after the blaze. In the first year after a fire, the snow disappearance date advanced by an average of 3.3 days. That might not sound like much, but the figure is just an average for the entire West — in some parts of Northern California and Oregon, the snow disappeared up to two weeks earlier. 
Over time, the effects of fire declined. Ten winters after a blaze, for example, the average snow disappearance date moved up by less than a day. 
While the advance of the snow disappearance date was most pronounced at lower elevations, the snowpack actually persisted slightly longer in some burned areas in Colorado and Utah, where the colder temperatures at higher elevations can insulate the snowpack from changes.
The finding that some higher elevation locations had a later snow disappearance date “would definitely be something to explore because everything that we know so far suggests that snow disappearance should be earlier after a fire,” Kampf said. 
Higher elevations may be less vulnerable to an early disappearance of the snowpack due to late-season storms. “Here in Colorado,” Kampf said, “we get a fair amount of spring snow, and so that’s one of the reasons why we’re not as sensitive because sometimes that snow just comes in May and it resets everything and you don’t see the big change in snow disappearance date.”
Another factor in explaining the regional differences is the West’s diversity of vegetation. 
“The forests are different in places that are colder, so you have different tree species and different densities of forest and different ecosystems in general,” Nolin said. “The northern tier of states and the high country — that’s where you would be probably seeing the least amount of change. It doesn’t mean, though, that you have the least amount of fire because some of these places, especially in places like Idaho and Washington state, have significant amount of fire, and there’s some interesting studies that have shown earlier snowmelt in those locations as well.”

How wildfires change streamflow
Previous research has found that wildfires can significantly alter the timing and magnitude of runoff in burned watersheds, but scientists are still unraveling the details.
“If you burn down the forest, you don’t have as many trees that are using that water,” Nolin said. “You probably expect the streamflow to be earlier because the snow’s melting off earlier.”
Fires can not only kill trees and ground cover that would absorb water — they can also eliminate organic material in the soil, which causes the ground to become more water repellent and makes the snowmelt more likely to run off into streams. 
A 2022 study that examined 72 forested basins that burned across the West found that average streamflow was significantly higher after a wildfire for an average of six years. The increase in streamflow was greater in areas where the extent of wildfire was larger. That study also found that the annual acreage burned by wildfires in the West skyrocketed by more than 1,100% from 1984 to 2020. 
Kampf said more research is needed to understand how streamflow changes after a fire. “We don’t have all those interactions figured out yet, but there have been some studies that have shown that streamflow actually decreases after fire,” Kampf said. “We certainly know it will affect streamflow timing, but the amount of streamflow we’re less sure.”
Fire intensity is one key determinant of subsequent streamflow. 
“If the forest is totally torched, then the increased solar radiation that’s coming into the snowpack is going to have a much bigger effect than if the trees still have live branches on them,” Kampf said. “Similarly, when you get down to the soil, if the soil is totally burned to a crisp, then its infiltration impacts will be much greater than if a lot of the litter and other stuff in the soil is still there.”
Nolin said she would have liked to see the authors distinguish between areas of high, moderate and low burn intensity. 
“When you see photographs of burned areas, we tend to show the photos that are most dramatic with just charred trunks that have [been] left behind, but in fact, most fires are mainly low to moderate burn severity that maintain the forest canopy,” Nolin said. “To not distinguish between different burn severities and to indicate that it’s all about the canopy being burned off and all of this carbon shedding on the snow — I think that stretches the results.”
The speed of vegetation recovery also shapes how the snowpack and streamflows respond to wildfire over time.
“If it’s a forest type where the vegetation can respond quickly and come back, that’s going to be a really different response than if the vegetation is slow to grow,” Kampf said. “Here in Colorado, we have some fires where it’s not coming back as forest at all, and where there are just no seedlings, and so we would expect the fire effect on snow to persist for a long time because we just don’t have trees coming back.”
The post-fire effects on streamflow tend to be localized, so it can be difficult to detect their impact on major river basins. 
“Even though the fires we’ve been experiencing have been really large, they’re still not huge compared to the size of the watershed as a whole,” Kampf said. “If you looked at something like the Colorado River Basin, it might be hard to detect the fire effect on the flow because there’s such a huge area that’s contributing to that flow. So in terms of how water is managed in forecasting and dam operations, I don’t think we’re there yet in terms of knowing how to account for fire.”
A major worry for water managers is the threat of high-intensity fires burning through dense stands of forest in the watersheds above their systems. 
“Those are places that water managers are concerned about because if the forest burns, then they experience problems with post-fire erosion and sedimentation and harms to water infrastructure, so it’s kind of a different side of the water management issue,” Kampf said.
Impacts on ecosystems
Besides posing challenges for water managers, wildfires can have profound effects on wildlife and forest health.
For aquatic ecosystems, “having a shift in the timing of when flow is coming in could also have an impact,” Kampf said, but “probably the greater impact is when that flow is bringing in with it a lot of sediments that are changing the habitat more profoundly.”
More rapid melting of the snowpack after a fire can also lead to a longer dry season for forests.
“If the snow disappears earlier, plants will start greening up sooner,” Kampf said. “If they’re not getting a lot of summer rain, they may find drier conditions later in the growing season that can stress plants.”
In addition to snow disappearing earlier due to fires, Nolin said the weather in November is getting drier. “If you have an earlier snow disappearance date and a later snowfall date, that dry season’s really getting quite a bit longer, and so it means that you have a decline in forest health and you also have an increase in the potential” for a longer fire season, Nolin said.
How burned ecosystems will respond to fire remains an open question as the climate continues to warm. In many parts of the West, decades have passed since flames swept through a forest, but trees have yet to return.
The burned trees may be centuries old, “and the climate was different than when those little seedlings sprouted and became the big trees that ultimately were involved in the fire,” Nolin said. “They grew initially under a different climate, and we don’t have that climate anymore, so we might see a lot more shrubs.”
Nolin said the paper “used a very simplistic approach to looking at future impacts on snow” by only examining what will happen under 2 degrees Celsius of warming. Climate change will also alter such factors as relative humidity and precipitation, so including these other effects “would’ve been more nuanced and perhaps a little more supportable,” Nolin said. She would have liked to see the results for various temperature increases up to 4 degrees Celsius, noting that mountains are warming faster due to climate change, and a key question is whether rain or snow will fall under warmer conditions. 
“Just having a single temperature change to look at helps us understand the impacts of temperature, and that’s great, but there is a lot more to be done in this area,” Nolin said.

Chronic wasting disease, or CWD, is a fatal and contagious neurological disease that threatens hooved mammals, such as elk and deer. 
The disease is a threat to domestic and wild animals, according to the Idaho State Department of Agriculture. 
“We tested it for CWD and it came back negative – that was the biggest concern right there,” Idaho Department of Fish and Game spokesman Roger Phillips said Wednesday. 
Phillips said it is extremely rare for a domestic elk to escape from a fenced facility in Idaho and be shot by a hunter. He said he is not aware of any other such instances, and said the hunter was not cited and is not under investigation. 
Because chronic wasting disease is a fatal disease that is able to be spread between animals through means that include contact with infected body fluids, stopping or limiting spread of the disease is a concern for state officials at the Idaho Department of Fish and Game, the Idaho State Department of Agriculture and hunters across the West. 
For the first time in state history, domestic elk from two eastern Idaho captive domestic elk facilities tested positive for CWD in 2024 and early 2025, according to the Idaho State Department of Agriculture. 
 State is investigating the escape, Idaho state veterinarian says

The escaped domestic elk killed this fall was in eastern Idaho’s hunting unit 63A, Phillips said. Unit 63A includes portions of two of the counties – Madison County and Jefferson County – where the state reported positive CWD cases at domestic elk facilities.

Idaho State Veterinarian Dr. Scott Leibsle said the state is investigating the escape.  
“We are aware of the escape, and as provided in statute, we conduct an investigation regarding any escaped domestic elk,” Leibsle said in a phone interview. “The investigation is ongoing, and we can’t comment on the specifics.”
In general, Leibsle said investigations involve an inspection of the facility where the domestic elk escaped, an interview with the facility’s owner or staff and the reconciliation of the year-end inventory count of domestic animals at the facility. Depending on the size of the facility and number of animals, the inventory and reconciliation process could take a couple of months and may not be completed until spring, Leibsle said. 
Part of the reason for the inventory and reconciliation phase of investigation is to ensure that all of the animals are accounted for and that no other animals are missing or could have escaped. 
There are several types of domestic cervidae or domestic elk facilities in Idaho. Some are breeding facilities, some raise the animals for meat or to sell and some operate high-fenced hunting ranches, where clients pay to hunt big game or trophy animals such as elk or buffalo on fenced, private land. Some large facilities include a combination of several types of facilities.  
An example of a fenced hunting ranch is the Broadmouth Canyon Ranch, which is located in eastern Idaho near Firth and owned by former NFL player Rulon Jones. 
Jeff Abrams, wildlife associate with the Idaho Conservation League, said the escaped elk was killed on state land located about three miles from the Broadmouth Canyon Ranch’s fenced hunting facility. 
State officials have declined to name the specific facility where the domestic elk escaped from. 
Less than two years ago, Jones and his son Chase Jones testified in favor of a new Idaho state law that removed a requirement to have double-fencing in place at domestic facilities where animals have tested positive for CWD.
 Elk escaped after Idaho Legislature loosened fencing regulations for domestic facilities

The domestic elk escaped less than two years after the Idaho Legislature passed a 2024 law, House Bill 591, that eliminated the requirement to place double-fencing around quarantined domestic Cervidae or elk farms that were under quarantine orders following a positive CWD test. The law also allowed for the transfer of potentially infected animals to other captive elk facilities under the same ownership, according to minutes of the Idaho Legislature’s Senate Agricultural Affairs Committee. 
Conservationists and wildlife groups opposed the law during public committee hearings at the Idaho State Capitol in 2024. 
Jonathan Oppenheimer, then of the Idaho Conservation League, and Brian Brooks and Garrett Visser of the Idaho Wildlife Foundation, argued that passing the law would weaken existing rules put in place attempting to contain the spread of chronic wasting disease among domestic elk. Oppenheimer told legislators that the double-fencing rule was specifically put in place to allow domestic elk operators to import animals from Alberta, Canada, where CWD is more prevalent. 
On the other hand, former Sen. Jeff Siddoway, R-Terreton, said that the double-fencing requirement was a strict and onerous government regulation that would put domestic elk ranching operations out of business, according to minutes from the Senate Agricultural Affairs Committee. Siddoway said it could cost $80,000 to $100,000 per mile of fence to comply with the double-fencing requirement. 
Chase Jones told Idaho legislators that he has 18 miles of fencing around his ranch and the double-fencing requirement would cost him between $1.3 million and $1.6 million, state records show. The double-fencing requirement would cripple his business, he said. 
In arguing for the law’s passage in March 2024, Siddoway told legislators that no domestic elk had tested positive for chronic wasting disease in Idaho. 
Siddoway was correct.
But later that year, in December 2024, the Idaho State Department of Agriculture announced that a bull elk that had been transferred from Alberta, Canada, to a domestic elk ranch in Madison County, Idaho, died and tested positive for CWD. 
It was the first case in state history of a positive CWD test at a domestic elk facility in Idaho.
Just over two weeks later, on Jan. 3, 2025, the Idaho State Department of Agriculture announced that a second domestic elk located at a different captive elk ranch located in Jefferson County, Idaho, had died and tested positive for CWD. 
Idaho State Department of Agriculture officials said the second case of CWD was not associated with the first positive case announced just two weeks prior. 
Following the second positive test, Department of Agriculture officials issued a quarantine order to restrict further movement of domestic elk at the Jefferson County facility. 
The Department of Agriculture did not identify the specific domestic elk facilities. Instead, officials announced the county where each facility was located.
In an interview last week, Leibsle, the state veterinarian, told the Idaho Capital Sun that the department’s policy is to announce cases at the county level. 
Leibsle told the Sun he did not take a position on the 2024 law. Instead, he said his job is to simply comply with and enforce the state laws on the books. Leibsle told the Sun that that double-fencing requirement would be a heavy economic burden to comply with and may not prevent the spread of CWD. 
For example, if a domestic elk died within the second fence, CWD could still be spread if rainfall washed infected tissue from a dead animal outside of the fence or if a vulture or buzzard picked up pieces of an infected dead animal’s flesh and moved the flesh somewhere else or spread inflected prions through defecating. 
“There are a lot of different opportunities for this to be spread, and it’s just not very well understood,” Leibsle said. 
However, Leibsle said a double fence could potentially limit the spread of CWD in some ways.
“If they had a double fence with separation, that would limit nose-to-nose contact between wild and domestic animals,” Leibsle said.

Marisa Sweeney, a vegan nutritionist and yoga instructor who goes by “Queen Sweeen” on Instagram, will join the New Jersey Assembly in January after flipping a legislative seat that had been in Republican hands for over half a century.
Sweeney had never run for elected office before she beat two-term incumbent Assemblyman Christian Barranco in Morris County’s 25th Legislative District last month, snagging the most votes in a four-way race. Her win is “just starting to feel real,” she told the New Jersey Monitor.
“Honestly, I’m just coming down from all the surrealness of it,” she said. “It’s a good feeling, because I’m ready to get to work.”
Sweeney attributed her win partly to Democrats’ dominance in the Nov. 4 election both nationally and in New Jersey, including Mikie Sherrill’s resounding victory in the governor’s race. Sweeney’s legislative district lies within the congressional district Sherrill represented for seven years.
But Sweeney is also a known name in her community, she said, as a longtime Morristown business owner. She founded and runs a women’s health and wellness center in Morristown called Be Well Integrative Health Services, which also provides nutrition programs in 10 other states under a partnership with a chain of fertility clinics. She also owns the New Jersey VegFest, a biannual vegan food festival in Montclair and Asbury Park.
Voters were receptive to her message, she said. She cast herself during the campaign as a change agent in a country battered by inflation and affordability concerns, the recent government shutdown, and the Trump administration’s controversial cuts and policy changes.
She assured voters she is a “regular person” and not one of the career politicians who pack Trenton’s Statehouse and other political arenas.
“I’m ecstatic — ecstatic! — to be here. I knew on paper going into this race that I was the underdog,” Sweeney said, referring to the GOP’s longtime control of the district.
She added: “I want to be part of — not to sound too corny — but making the world a better place, honestly. I’m very heart-driven, and I like to think people connected with that.”
Sweeney will represent the district with incumbent Assemblywoman Aura Dunn, a Republican.
Debbie Walsh is director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University’s Eagleton Institute of Politics. She said Sweeney’s win holds lessons for party leaders.
“It sends a message that women are a good return on investment as candidates,” Walsh said.

Sweeney will stand out in the Legislature as “someone who’s a little outside the box,” Walsh said, pointing to her age, gender, and “vibrant presence” on social media.
Sweeney will be one of the Legislature’s youngest members, at 41, and among its few women. The Assembly, where men outnumber women by more than 2 to 1, lost seven female incumbents in last month’s general election but gained three women newcomers — Sweeney, Katie Brennan in Hudson County’s 32nd District, and Maureen Rowan in Atlantic County’s 2nd District.
They’ll enter the Statehouse at a tumultuous time in New Jersey politics, as the power of party leaders slowly wanes after the toppling of the controversial county line. Under that system, ballot placement largely favored candidates supported by county party leaders.
“I think what’s going to be fascinating to watch is how they function in this institution, because they are not as beholden to a party in the same way of folks who came up in the past. They may not just fall into lockstep” with legislative and party leaders, Walsh said.
Sweeney said she and her running mate, Steve Pylypchuk, didn’t rely on their party’s backing or raise much money.
“I’m going into this not connected to anything or anyone,” she said. “I’m going to do everything that I can to just stay true to me and why I decided to do this in the first place.”
Sweeney, who grew up in Brick and graduated from Montclair State University, isn’t a total political rookie. She serves on Morristown’s planning board and has testified and lobbied on various health bills in Trenton in her role as a former board member and president of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.
Her experience testifying before state legislators made her want to become one, she added.
“We were presenting the research- and evidence-based solutions to people — and then hoping that it was going to pass,” she said. “Instead of waiting around for other people to decide things, I wanted to be part of actually making changes that need to happen.”
In Trenton, she aims to protect social safety nets and champion measures to strengthen health care, which she complained have weakened under President Donald Trump’s administration. Her anger with his policies is clear on her social media, where she has blasted the feds’ brief suspension of food assistance, its Medicaid cuts, and its recent exclusion of nursing, teaching, and other careers from the list of professional degrees eligible for federal loans.
“It’s most certainly not humane in terms of building our communities and allowing people to thrive, but it’s also most certainly not good for our economy either,” she said. “I think it’s shortsighted for people to think that by making all these cuts that it’s going to strengthen our economy. Both of those things can actually exist simultaneously — we can take care of people, and we can do it in a fiscally responsible way.”
She also hopes to focus on improving affordability for both residents and small business owners. Beyond that, she figures she’ll do a lot of listening and see where the job takes her.
“The nature of what I do for nutrition counseling is a lot of listening, and as basic and rudimentary as that might sound, I don’t think there’s enough listening to constituents to really hear what the needs are,” she said. “So I’m coming in with an open heart and open ears.”

(Photo: Cassandra Stephenson/Tennessee Lookout)Two weeks after the City of Martin’s mayor and economic development director were indicted on multiple felony charges of theft and official misconduct, remaining city leadership is facing a reckoning. 
The Martin City Board of Aldermen unanimously accepted the resignations of former Mayor Randal “Randy” Brundige and former economic development director Bradley Thompson during a special meeting on Nov. 25.
Before the board voted to appoint Vice Mayor David Belote as the city’s mayor — a position he would hold until the next city election in November 2026 — one of the board’s newest members questioned how Martin could move forward under the leadership of officials who were in power over the last decade and failed to catch nearly half a million dollars in alleged misappropriations.
Jacob Crowe, who began representing Ward 3 in December 2024, called for the resignations of Belote, Alderman Danny Nanney and Alderman Terry Hankins, each of whom served on the city’s Finance Committee over the last decade. The trio was not mentioned in the Tennessee comptroller’s report, nor do they face charges.
“Our city is hurting right now, and there are people that have lost confidence in what this board is … I don’t know if we can move forward with the confidence of how this board sits,” Crowe said.
Belote said the city could hold a special election for a new mayor as early as April 2026, but that would be within a few months of the city’s regularly scheduled election in November.
The board approved Belote’s appointment 4-1, with Crowe voting no. But after several members of the public expressed their concerns about the board’s lack of oversight, Belote said he too would consider resigning.
Martin mayor indicted on theft of funds, official misconduct 

“I don’t know what processes are going to take place in order for that to happen, but I hear you,” Belote said. “Do I want to be part of (the work ahead)? Sure, I would like to, but … you’ve said what you’ve said, and I’ve taken it in. And if it’s time, it’s time, for me.”
Brundige, Thompson, and Brundige’s daughter, Natalie, were indicted on Nov. 12 after an investigation by the Tennessee Comptroller’s Office uncovered a combined misuse of more than $450,000 in public funds since February 2015. 
Brundige, who served as Martin’s mayor since 2002, is accused of using his city-issued credit card to pay for high-end meals, alcohol and other questionable purchases, according to the comptroller’s report. Natalie Brundige, a former custodian for the Martin Police Department, received at least $174,000 over six years as a full-time employee, though she routinely worked only two hours of her scheduled 8-hour shifts, the report states. 
Thompson, who also owns a firm called One Consulting, billed the city for grant writing and administrative services completed by the firm that were already part of his official duties as economic development director, according to investigators. Randy Brundige approved the payments to the firm despite the lack of a contract between the company and the city.
In his resignation letter, Thompson listed the city’s accomplishments in his 13-year tenure and said the allegations against him are “unfounded.” 
“I conducted my work with the full approval of the mayor, the board of alderpersons and legal counsel,” Thompson wrote. “Never once … did I write a check to myself. Each check payable to me was approved, written and signed by at least four authorized employees.”
Randy Brundige brought a resolution to the board to retroactively approve One Consulting’s work for the city on Nov. 12, 2024 after investigators began to question the firm’s invoices, according to the comptroller’s report.
Meeting minutes show the board at the time — including Belote, Nanney and Hankins — unanimously approved the resolution with no questions.
‘Business as usual’
Belote said Martin’s Finance Committee, which is composed of five aldermen, a chairman and two citizens, didn’t meet as much as needed over the last three years.
Crowe, who has nearly 20 years of experience in finance, noted that he was not appointed to the finance committee.
The committee met at the behest of the mayor, Belote said, adding that he asked the mayor to call more finance meetings several times, to no avail.
“We elected a mayor — you elected a mayor – for six terms. Six terms. Now, what does that say? It says … the people of Martin wanted Randy Brundige as the mayor. And you cast that vote because you trust that person,” Belote said. “You trust that person to do their job. You trust that person to do the things that the charter requires in order to be mayor. The mayor runs the internal operations of the city. Everything comes from him.”
Hankins said the board “didn’t know anything about” the alleged misappropriations. Regarding the board’s approval of the contract with One Consulting in 2024, Belote said the board wasn’t told that Thompson owned the company.
“We’re just thinking this is business as usual,” Belote said. “So that information was not given to us. Should we have known it?”
“Yes,” a member of the audience answered.
“I don’t know, but we did not, and it wasn’t revealed to us until the eleventh hour,” Belote continued.
An audio recording of the November 2024 meeting published by The Weakley County Examiner shows the board was told that Thompson owned One Consulting prior to their vote.
Residents call for transparency; Board calls for civic participation
Martin residents who addressed the board spoke of the need for more transparency and accountability. A few reminded the board and audience that Randy Brundige, Thompson and Natalie Brundige have been charged but not yet convicted. Some residents and board members called for more community involvement in local politics.
Jordan Long, an attorney, said aldermen were using what he calls the “Shaggy Defense”: “It wasn’t me,” a reference to the popular song “It Wasn’t Me” released by Jamaican-American reggae musician Shaggy in 2000. Long read an email he sent to the board on Nov. 15, 2024 — three days after the board approved the One Consulting contract — informing them that Thompson owned the company. 










Your prolonged failure of oversight is an unacceptable breach of duty. Resignation is the only honorable choice remaining.


– Kent Kelso, Martin resident


Long said it is correct that the residents of Martin voted to put Randy Brundige in office.
“We don’t pass a budget. We don’t have a level of oversight that you all do. Don’t tell us that we failed, because you failed,” he said.
Kent Kelso, a professor at the University of Tennessee at Martin, said “numerous officials,” including the Board of Aldermen, showed a “pattern of knowing and willful neglect” and breaches of the city’s charter.
Kelso called for the investigation and removal of “all personnel implicit in the misconduct … and those who have kept silent, thus aiding and abetting these issues.” He also asked for the resignation of board members and city officials who held office “throughout these years of documented corruption, fraud, malfeasance, and felonious acts.”
“Your prolonged failure of oversight is an unacceptable breach of duty,” Kelso said. “Resignation is the only honorable choice remaining.”
Joyce Washington, a resident since 2007, said the city now has a “perception problem” and needs to move forward. 
“We have to do something different than move forward with the composition of the … board as it is currently constituted,” Washington said. 
She added that some of the board meetings she has attended in the past have been short — around 10 minutes — and called for more transparency
“If we had that, we wouldn’t be sitting here tonight,” Washington said.
Reflecting on his time in office, Belote, who is 72, said he ran for all six of his terms with no opposition. For his last two terms, he waited to file his petition to see who else, if anyone, would throw their hat in the ring. No one did. 
“That’s not right for any system,” he said.
Hankins said he ran unopposed for four of his five terms. 
“Sometimes I wonder if anybody cares,” Hankins said.
He said he won’t seek reelection in 2026.

(Courtesy photo)Nearly 3,000 North Carolinians could lose housing under changes to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s [HUD] competitive grant program for permanent housing, according to an estimate by the National Alliance to End Homelessness.
The alliance and other advocates are bracing for HUD reforms that will dramatically change the way the federal government funds permanent housing assistance programs.
The changes could cost the state more than $24 million in funding for programs that house people experiencing homelessness, the organization told N.C. Newsline. Nationally, more than 170,000 people could be at risk of homelessness due to changes to the $3.9 billion grant program, the alliance said.

“Without that funding, it means services are disrupted, if not stopped altogether,” said Marcy Thompson, the alliance’s vice president of programs and policy. “If they [service providers] can’t continue operating, landlords don’t get rent. It creates a lot of distrust within the community.”
Grant reapplication required
At issue are federal Continuum of Care (CoC) grants, which is the largest federal grant program specifically for assisting people experiencing homelessness. 
The competitive grants are awarded on a two-year cycle, but HUD has required a new competition one year into the funding cycle.
“What we know is, there was originally a two-year promise,” said Liz Carbone, project specialist with the North Carolina Coalition to End Homelessness. “That promise has been walked back.”

Carbone said the new competition could delay funding until spring for some awardees, leaving nonprofits scrambling to fill funding gaps to pay rent.
“We know that conservatively, best case, we will not see awards in our state until the end of May,” Carbone said. “The funding delay alone is going to be so deeply painful for our state.”
Most communities do not have the resources on hand to fill funding gaps if there are significant delays in grant awards, Carbone said. “If communities feel the need to assume these programs and keep them going, which I think most communities will, that’s a cost to the local taxpayer.” 
Federal money for homeless programs is dispersed through 12 Continuums of Care in North Carolina. Most are focused on larger cities such as Asheville, Charlotte, Durham, Raleigh and Wilmington.

Program priorities reversed
The controversial program changes come as HUD breaks from the long-favored “Housing First” approach, which prioritizes providing immediate access to permanent housing without prerequisites. HUD is moving to a transitional housing approach that includes work and sobriety requirements.

“These long-overdue reforms will promote independence and ensure we are supporting means-tested approaches to carry out the President’s mandate, connect Americans with the help they need, and make our cities and towns beautiful and safe,” HUD Secretary Scott Turner said in a statement announcing the changes.
One of the HUD reforms caps the amount of funding that each Continuum of Care (CoC) can use for permanent housing at no more than 30% of CoC funding. Currently, 87% of CoC-funded projects are for permanent housing or rapid-rehousing.
A new scoring criteria penalizes nonprofits competing for federal grants if they are located in areas that don’t, for example, have public camping bans in place. A statewide bill in North Carolina to enact such a ban stalled in the state Senate but some local municipalities have such bans in place.  
In July, President Trump issued an executive order that directed the HUD secretary and other cabinet secretaries to “determine whether priority” for grants may be given to grantees in states and municipalities that actively enforce prohibitions on urban camping and loitering, open illicit drug use and urban squatting.
The policy changes also penalize nonprofits for promoting diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) or “gender ideology extremism,” and for the alleged “misuse of and abuse of taxpayers dollars on illegal aliens.”
“Some of the things that HUD is essentially penalizing organizations and communities for are things that were required of them in the last administration,” said Marcy Thompson at the National Alliance to End Homelessness. “There’s no community, no organization that is not at risk of being impacted here.”
Twenty congressional Republicans have asked HUD Secretary Scott Turner to renew grants expiring in 2026 for an additional year.
“This extension is essential to prevent service disruptions for individuals and families experiencing homelessness, sustain continuity of care for vulnerable populations, and allow HUD adequate time to implement its next generation of homelessness policy reforms,” the Republicans said in a letter to Turner.
While none of North Carolina’s congressional Republicans signed the letter, Carbone said advocates have had “super productive conversations” with several GOP U.S. House members and Republican U.S. Sens. Ted Budd and Thom Tillis.  
“They see the impacts that this is going to have, not just in the cities, but in the rural communities, and what this is going to do to North Carolina’s ability to keep the most vulnerable people in our state housed,” Carbone said. 
“Regardless of your political affiliation … we all care about seniors, we all care about families with young kids and we all care about veterans,” Carbone said.
Impact on the ground

In Statesville, Tamara Roach, executive director of Fifth Street Ministries, is three months into her new job. Roach would like to spend time meeting with donors, reviewing programs and preparing Thanksgiving meals the nonprofit will provide on Thursday. 
But recent days have been hectic. Roach has been busy with paperwork to meet this past Monday’s deadline for “letters of intent” to apply for the new HUD grants. Formal applications are due Jan. 14, she said.  
Nonprofits were only given a week to respond, she said.     
“I don’t think that providers are panicking, but we are paying attention,” Roach said. “It’s a very quick turnaround.” 
She said it’s healthy that HUD has asked providers to rethink models, reexamine how they define a disability and to discuss which services are leading to long-term housing stability.
“It’s just that we’re not being given much time at all to think about this and pivot,” Roach said. “I think some decisions folks are going to make are not going to be popular, but people can’t keep doing what they’ve always been doing without other collaboration and without other partners stepping up.”
To illustrate how funding changes could impact her organization, Roach shared a story about a client who lived in her car for months. Under the current funding model, Fifth Street Ministries, placed her in rapid rehousing, signed her up for counseling, connected her to medication to treat a bipolar disorder and enrolled her in a job training program.
Today, the client is housed and stable, Roach said.
“Under the new criteria, she may no longer qualify for that pathway because her bipolar disorder is no longer considered a disability,” Roach said. “If something happens and she’s not supported, it’s not as if she’s going to disappear. She’s going to cycle back to living in cars and shelters.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Image-7-e1764349534150-1024x769.png,,,2025-12-01 06:56:26.373488

(Photo by Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)The state of play for Arkansas’ young-yet-ambitious lithium industry has changed markedly compared to one year ago, even as questions remain about the impacts of low lithium prices on projects.
Almost exactly a year after prospective producers were dealt a defeat by the Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission over proposed royalty payments, business executives and lawmakers extolled the potential of the state’s lithium industry at the 2025 edition of the Arkansas Lithium Innovation Summit last month. Speakers from Google, Standard Lithium, Chevron, Fastmarkets and more spoke of how Arkansas’ lithium reserves could play into national security objectives, data centers for artificial intelligence and the clean energy transition.
Policymakers like Arkansas Secretary of Commerce Hugh McDonald touted Arkansas’ long history with the oil and gas industry and business-friendly climate to position the state as a future national leader in the “energy storage value chain.”
 
Read more about the big players in Arkansas’ lithium industry, and the events leading up to the first lithium royalty approval, here.


“When we met in February 2024, we spoke of promise. Now, in October 2025, we speak of progress. Extraordinary progress has been made in Arkansas the last 18 months,” McDonald said during remarks at the start of the summit. “We have a world-class resource in the Smackover Formation. … We aspire to become the most reliable, economic and sustainable domestic lithium resource.”
Extracting Arkansas’ underground lithium could be game changing for the U.S. as a whole as it tries to break its reliance on China and other foreign countries for the critical mineral that powers everything from smartphones to electric vehicles. A U.S. Geological Survey study found last year that Southwest Arkansas alone could produce enough lithium to supply the entirety of the world’s demand for car batteries in 2030 nine times over — though that study didn’t examine whether it was possible to extract all of it.
Lithium is found in the Smackover Formation’s salty brines, thousands of feet below the earth’s surface. Companies like ExxonMobil and Standard Lithium aim to extract it using commercially untested direct lithium extraction technology, which is similar to water softening. The formation stretches from East Texas to the western side of the Florida Panhandle, and the section underlying South Arkansas has long been associated with the Natural State’s oil and gas industry.
The summit came after a year and a half of back-and-forth between the state’s oil and gas regulator and prospective lithium producers over fair and equitable royalties for south Arkansas mineral rights owners. The Oil and Gas Commission approved royalty payment structures for two companies this year, clearing what has been referred to as the final undetermined regulatory hurdle.
The royalties aside, big names in Arkansas’ lithium space said they made strides in 2025. Canada-based Standard Lithium and Equinor, a Norwegian energy company, released a string of positive news about the feasibility of its Smackover Lithium project. The two companies have pointed to $225 million in U.S. Department of Energy funding and its designation as a priority critical mineral project by the Trump administration as evidence of the project’s strengths. Executives with the companies said on multiple occasions that they would make a decision about giving the final go-ahead for the project by early 2026.
Meanwhile, Chevron joined fellow American petroleum giants ExxonMobil and Occidental Petroleum in snapping up mineral rights in the state’s southwest region.
Shane Khoury, secretary of the Arkansas Department of Energy and Environment, told the Advocate in an interview at the summit that figuring out the royalty had been a long process, but that future lithium royalties would be able to rely on its precedent.
“I think [the royalty-setting process] was a little bit longer than we probably all anticipated,” Khoury said, in part because the state “didn’t have anybody to turn to and look at and say, ‘How do we value this process?’”
The state’s existing regulatory framework for brine extraction guided the process, Khoury said. Companies have been extracting bromine from brine in South Arkansas since the 1960s. The structure of the two approved royalties provides both a framework for other Arkansas lithium projects and for lithium projects in other states, he said.
“We kind of had to invent the wheel to start,” Khoury said. “They don’t have to reinvent the wheel.”
Still, much of the optimism at the summit was cautious. While remaining positive overall about the trajectory of the U.S. lithium industry over the few decades, multiple business leaders warned of how lithium prices, down from a massive pandemic-era spike thanks to supply outstripping demand, could negatively affect the U.S. industry’s attempts to get off the ground should they not increase. And closer to home, local community leaders from South Arkansas and executives from utility companies said that the region would be facing growing demands for power, housing and other resources that will likely need to be built out rapidly as the industry grows.
First-of-its-kind lithium technology accelerator kicks off in Arkansas

“The lithium industry, much like a lot of the new industries coming to Arkansas, are big power consumers,” Entergy Arkansas Vice President of Business Operations and Strategy Kristen Dalrymple said during a panel on infrastructure.
Arkansas’ transmission capacity is nearing its limits, which likely means there will be a large expansion of power transmission in the state in the coming years, Dalrymple said.
Nonprofit electric grid manager, Little Rock-based Southwest Power Pool, approved an $8.6 billion plan in November to upgrade and expand transmission grid capabilities across 14 states, Arkansas Business reported.
The need for more electricity and expanded transmission lines is especially true in the rural South Arkansas areas where lithium companies are locating, Dalrymple said. Striking a balance between attracting business and maintaining affordability is important, especially at a time where demand for power and grid upgrades is growing nationally as well, which impacts cost and timelines, she said.
“I’ll just say that it is unprecedented levels of growth we were talking about,” Dalrymple said. “So it’s an exciting time, but it’s a challenge in terms of making sure that we’re planning ahead, but also not overcommitting. So we need to strike that right balance.”
For its part, Entergy is seeking regulatory approval to build a $1.6 billion gas-fueled power plant near Redfield to take up some of the energy generating slack when it retires two coal-fired plants, one in 2028 and another in 2030, Arkansas Business reported.
Despite the challenges, policymakers remain optimistic.
“The lithium boom requires everything from skilled engineers to updated power grids and new housing and finally, state and federal policies that enable end-to-end development of the nation’s lithium supply chain,” McDonald said. “We can’t be all things to all sections of the supply chain, so, for now, we want to focus our strategy and lean into our natural advantages in building an industrial ecosystem.”
Republican Sen. Steve Crowell of Magnolia told the Advocate that while hurdles, such as power infrastructure and overcoming skepticism from financial backers beyond Arkansas, remain for the industry, “we’re moving in the right direction.”
Crowell said that 18 months previously there were still lots of unknowns about the lithium extraction projects.
“Now, as you’re seeing, there’s lots of facts, there’s lots of stats, there’s lots of things that are going down,” he said.
Local, state and federal leadership have been aligned in a way he called “an anomaly” to help the lithium industry succeed. Crowell said he would be shocked if there weren’t more large leaps by the industry in 2026.
“So that is a million dollar question: Where are we going to be a year from now?” Crowell said. “As I see it, it’s only a trajectory of up.”

He is requiring libraries that receive state or federal grant funds to make an “age-appropriate” review of books and meet an order by President Donald Trump called “Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government.”
The order has required some libraries to shut down temporarily, according to a WTVF report, and go through the expensive task of poring over books to determine whether they contain gender identity topics.

More than 30 organizations nationally signed on to a letter expressing “profound concern” about Hargett’s September and October letters issued within the Tennessee Regional Library System demanding a full review within 60 days. In addition to creating “widespread confusion, fear and operational disruption” in libraries statewide, the order put a costly burden on libraries and created the risk of illegal censorship, the letter says.
“It is illegal to remove books from public libraries because some people do not like them. This is a well-settled legal principle,” the letter says. It adds that reviews for removal based on a person’s “subjective opinion” threaten First Amendment rights.
The letter also says the executive order, which regulates only federal agencies, is not legislation and points out that Congress opted not to pursue such a bill.
Hargett’s Sept. 8 letter to the Library Regional System ordering the reviews says Trump’s executive order prevents federal funds from being used to promote gender ideology, which “replaces the biological category of sex with an ever-shifting concept of self-assessed gender identity.”
The secretary of state also makes note of a new state law, Dismantling DEI Departments Act, that “prevents governmental entities from using discriminatory preferences to promote diversity, equity, or inclusion.” He encourages libraries with questions about grant contracts or federal and state laws to contact their county attorney.
Final reports by regional libraries are to be made by Jan. 19, 2026 to the Tennessee State Librarian and Archivist.
Hargett’s office didn’t return a call Wednesday seeking comment.

(Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)The developer of the Dakota Access Pipeline is appealing a North Dakota’s judge’s decision not to interfere in a free speech lawsuit Greenpeace filed against the company overseas.
The Amsterdam-based Greenpeace International filed the case in February in response to Energy Transfer’s lawsuit accusing it of engaging in acts including conspiracy and defamation to stop the Dakota Access Pipeline from being built. 
That lawsuit, which is ongoing in North Dakota district court, is also against two other Greenpeace entities: Greenpeace USA and Greenpeace Fund. In March, a Morton County jury handed down a more than $660 million verdict against Greenpeace, which the court later slashed by roughly half.
Greenpeace International’s counter-suit in the Netherlands alleges that Energy Transfer’s legal challenge is a ploy to waste its time and money. The Dutch case also claims Energy Transfer is liable for making defamatory statements about the environmental group. Greenpeace International has asked the court to order Energy Transfer to award it monetary damages.
Energy Transfer this summer asked Southwest District Court Judge James Gion to suspend the overseas lawsuit until the North Dakota case plays out — a request he rejected in September. 
Gion found that the cases consider different legal claims, so he didn’t think it necessary to stop the foreign action. Gion also stated he didn’t believe the Netherlands case would move quickly enough to affect the lawsuit in his court.
Now Energy Transfer wants the North Dakota Supreme Court to step in and order Gion to pause the Dutch lawsuit. The high court is set to hear arguments on the appeal on Dec. 18. 
In its petition to the Supreme Court, Energy Transfer claims the Dutch case “collaterally attacks the jury verdict” and is an attempt to sidestep North Dakota’s legal system.
“This Court’s intervention is needed to prevent a foreign entity (Greenpeace) from inviting a foreign tribunal to sit in judgment over North Dakota’s judiciary,” Energy Transfer wrote.
While Energy Transfer acknowledges no North Dakota court has ever attempted to pause a case in another country, they say it’s necessary in order to preserve the integrity of the North Dakota suit.
Judge slashes jury damages in Greenpeace case to $345 million

Greenpeace International has indicated it will participate in oral arguments before the high court in support of Gion’s decision. In legal documents, the organization said Energy Transfer has no basis for involving it in the North Dakota suit in the first place. It said it never had any staff visit North Dakota during the Dakota Access Pipeline protests, and that it only ever peripherally supported activism against the pipeline.
“International is a Netherlands entity with no connection to North Dakota,” it wrote. “It has thus consistently objected to Plaintiffs’ contentions that it could be haled into this jurisdiction to defend itself.”
Greenpeace was one of many activist groups that backed a movement led by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe to halt construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, which drew thousands of activists to protest in south-central North Dakota in 2016 and 2017.
The pipeline, often referred to as DAPL, carries crude oil from wells in northwest North Dakota to Illinois and has been in operation since 2017.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The state of North Dakota filed a friend-of-the-court brief in Energy Transfer’s appeal in support of neither party. 
The Supreme Court should use the case as an opportunity to develop guidelines on how North Dakota courts should handle requests to halt foreign lawsuits in the future, the state argued.
“In our current era of increasing political polarization, cross-jurisdictional legal tensions are likely to recur as polities continue to be increasingly aggressive in adopting divergent laws,” it wrote.
According to the state’s brief, orders to pause overseas lawsuits are generally warranted when the foreign case is substantially similar to a domestic lawsuit, and when the foreign action could impede the United States’ ability to enforce its own laws.
Greenpeace International’s lawsuit was filed under a 2024 European Union directive meant to protect activists and whistleblowers who face arbitrary legal action for exercising their free speech rights.
Greenpeace International has said its case may be the first to be filed under the new law.
The state of North Dakota in its brief appeared critical of the directive, writing that it “may have been purposefully enacted to facilitate the filing of lawsuits to collaterally challenge or undermine judicial proceedings that occur in third countries.”
Gion has yet to enter a final judgment in the North Dakota lawsuit. Earlier this month, he cut the jury’s more than $660 million verdict against Greenpeace to about $345 million.
Greenpeace has indicated previously that once Gion enters a judgment, it will ask for a new trial. If that request is unsuccessful, they will appeal the case to the North Dakota Supreme Court.

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)In 1965, after creating Medicare to provide health services for people over the age of 65, the federal government created Medicaid to help low-income children and disabled people of all ages access necessary health and human services. Medicare is funded and administered at the federal level. Medicaid is a joint venture through which a state receives most funding from the federal government but must pay a percentage based on the economic health of the state. In North Carolina, our federal Medicaid matching percentage is 68%. The state covers 32% of the cost. 
States administer Medicaid and set provider and hospital payment; these payment rates cannot exceed 100% of the Medicare rates. In 1989, Congress passed the Omnibus Budget Reduction Act (OBRA 89) which said that Medicaid payment should be sufficient for providers to afford to accept Medicaid patients just as they would patients who have private insurance. Providers have sued state governments because of inadequate Medicaid payment with little success, even though OBRA 89 says that adequate Medicaid payment is the responsibility of the states. 
North Carolina does not currently pay anywhere near the Medicare rates for Medicaid services, and Medicaid fees for providers have not kept up with the increasing cost of living in our economy for a number of years. The only way doctors and hospitals can participate in Medicaid is to generate revenue from patients who have private insurance, since private sector payments average about 130% of the Medicare rates.
In our state, we have seen the the percentage of children covered by Medicaid increase over the past few decades, meaning that it has become increasingly difficult for doctors and hospitals to cover their practice costs like staff salaries and supplies. In particular, rural family physicians, obstetricians, dentists, eye doctors, and pediatricians will be the health professionals who will most likely be forced to turn patients away when these Medicaid cuts reduce cash flow to the breaking point for practice survival. 
Personally, as a pediatrician who has developed a large multi-county “safety net” practice in eastern NC, I worry that we will have to limit our participation in Medicaid and force many of our 25,000+ Medicaid patients to seek care elsewhere – and there are very few options for these children in rural North Carolina.
I hope our General Assembly and Governor Stein understand the seriousness of these new Medicaid cuts for the at-risk low-income children in our state!

(Photo by Christiana Botic/Verite News and Catchlight Local/Report for America)NEW ORLEANS – Lucia Lopez was leaving St. Alphonsus Parish — her 3-year-old daughter in tow — after participating in the Eucharist adoration on Oct. 30 when her brother-in-law called. Federal immigration agents had arrested her husband, Orlin Lopez Fuentes, he told her.
“I didn’t believe it,” Lucia said in an interview at the church two weeks after he was detained. “I was in shock.”
Orlin, a welder, had been at work at a shipyard in Harvey when U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement conducted a large-scale raid capturing dozens of workers — all Honduran citizens.
A press release from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, published days after the arrests, quoted Deputy Special Agent In Charge Matt Wright from the agency’s local Homeland Security Investigations unit, based in New Orleans.
“This operation demonstrates our commitment to enforcing immigration laws and holding employers accountable,” Wright said.
However, the press release did not mention any penalties levied against Orlin’s employer, aside from the loss of laborers.
For Orlin, the greatest penalty was spending a month separated from Lucia and their two daughters Camila, 6, and Angeles, 3, he said in a phone interview Tuesday with Verite News.

“When I was arrested the first thing I thought [of] was my wife and my daughters. We had always been together,” Orlin said. “One of the most painful things you can put a person through is separating them from their family.”
Orlin is one of thousands of people in Louisiana caught in the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement dragnet that, despite its stated goals to prioritize the arrests and deportations of violent criminals, has indiscriminately impacted immigrant families, separating parents from children and splitting spouses apart.
Now, as the New Orleans metro area and the rest of Louisiana brace for the incursion of hundreds of U.S. Border Patrol agents who intend to sweep the region with immigration arrests similar to those seen in Illinois and North Carolina, Orlin, Lucia and their girls are planning to start their lives over in Honduras, where they can be together without fear of being ripped apart again.
Orlin was deported to Honduras on Nov. 22, ICE verified. Lucia said she and their children will soon join him there.
Friends at St. Alphonsus Parish called Orlin, a choir director at the church, a strong leader, who spoke up for Spanish speaking congregants and helped other men strengthen their relationships with God and their families.

Immigration attorney and fellow parishioner Marco Balducci said he felt compelled to help Orlin and his family navigate the immigration legal system. Their wish was “modest,” he said. Orlin hoped he would be released under ICE’s supervision so that they could tie up whatever loose ends they had and return to Honduras together within a few months. They had quickly come to terms with having to leave the U.S. and just wanted to do it as a family, on a normal, commercial flight.
Balducci said he’d try to make what they wished for a reality, but it wasn’t likely. He thought the way Orlin, who has no criminal record, was arrested and detained was not fair.
“Orlin is not somebody who deserves this,” Balducci said. “Given the violence and the force that’s being used both in the apprehension and the detention of people, this is an inappropriate method of immigration enforcement.”
Orlin said he was detained for nearly three weeks at Pine Prairie ICE Processing Center, a privately run detention facility in Evangeline Parish that, according to immigration data researchers calculations, has been operating well above its contractual capacity of 500 detainees for most of 2025. He shared a room that had four bunk beds with 13 other people – eight men slept in the beds. The other six or so, including Orlin, slept on mattresses on the floor, Orlin said. He was given an orange uniform, more than a week into his detention, he said. Before that, he had been wearing the clothes he was arrested in. He said he never received an extra change of clothes, including underwear, confirming what other recent detainees at the facility have reported. He would shower and then put the same clothes back on. Maybe that, he wondered, was why he broke out in rashes. Or maybe it was the blankets; they were made of a “weird” material, he said. Or maybe it was the tap water, which had a taste that Orlin likened to dirty toilet water.
Verite News contacted ICE for comment on the circumstances of Orlin’s detention and conditions at Pine Prarie, but the agency did not respond in time for publication.
Christopher Ferreira, director of corporate relations at Geo Group, the private prison corporation that owns and operates Pine Prairie said the company “rejects these allegations, which are meant to criticize the quality of our services,” in an emailed statement.
Ferreira said Pine Prairie issues all detainees two uniforms, two pairs of underwear, two pairs of socks and one pair of shoes at intake, adding that the company follows ICE’s detention standards.


Let us know what you think...


 


Orlin requested voluntary departure — a request to leave within a set time frame and at his own expense — which an immigration judge granted. But he wasn’t released. Balducci explained that the grant from the judge acknowledges that he’d chosen to close his case and leave on his own. It didn’t mean he would actually be released. Instead of leaving with his family, Orlin said, he was deported in handcuffs and shackles, with chains hanging from his chest and waist, for 10 hours, including the flight from Alexandria International Airport (in Central Louisiana) to Honduras.
“I think it was one of the worst experiences for me because I have never lived through being treated like that,” Orlin said. “They treated us like we were criminals and we really were just people who had a dream.”
Orlin said their dream was to make sure Camila lived. According to Lucia, Camila was only 52 days old when she and Orlin carried her across Mexico’s border with Texas. Lucia had given birth to two daughters before Camila, but they’d both died — one as a toddler and the other as an infant — of respiratory complications that the couple associated with air pollution from the cement factory in their town, Piedras Azules , where Orlin worked. They’d taken the second child to Tegucigalpa, the capital of Honduras, for specialized care. When she died, they lost faith in Honduras’ healthcare system.
Lucia said they would never have come to the United States if she hadn’t had Camila. But once she was born, they couldn’t imagine enduring the death of another child.

Since Orlin’s arrest, Camila has suffered from anxiety. She had to be picked up from school one day after a teacher called because she would not stop crying, Lucia said.
“She’s worried that the same thing that happened to her dad is gonna happen to me,” Lucia said in a phone interview on Tuesday. “She’s really traumatized by immigration. She doesn’t ever want to be alone.”
Now, Camila prays for the family to leave their home in Harvey, where, in anticipation of the upcoming Border Patrol sweeps, drones have been spotted hovering over the neighborhood, Lucia said. Her prayers will be answered by the end of the week.

Lucia has mixed feelings about returning home after six years. She’s happy her daughters will get to know life in Honduras, but she worries about difficulties with finding work and transportation there. And while she’ll be reunited with her mother and a sibling in Honduras, her daughters are being separated from their cousins here in the U.S.
Orlin’s work as a welder allowed them to save enough money to buy a house in Honduras. Lucia said she’s looking forward to making it a home. Orlin is hopeful that the family can “have peace” there.
Orlin said starting a new life back home can be “something beautiful.” He shared a parting message for other Hispanic immigrants “that want to keep trying for their dream in the U.S.”
“What I lived through is something that I wouldn’t wish on anyone,” he said. “Take care of yourselves, be careful, try to protect yourselves because things are getting pretty bad.”

Housing Hub Colorado — a collaboration between several state agencies, the Colorado Housing and Finance Authority, and Denver’s Department of Housing Stability — aligns application timelines and information for different entities that offer funding to developers building affordable rental housing. 
“Colorado is breaking down barriers to more housing people can afford and this one-stop shop will help make that possible in more communities across our state,” Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, said in a statement. “This effort will save people, and local communities, time and money when building new homes in Colorado.”

State agencies supporting the project include the Department of Local Affairs and the Office of Economic Development and International Trade. Funding sources for affordable housing come from the state’s local affairs department and Denver’s housing stability department.
“A strong economy depends on good-paying jobs and housing Coloradans can afford,” Eve Lieberman, executive director of the economic development office, said in a statement. “By simplifying the process of applying for funding, we are reducing time and cost burdens for communities and developers and accelerating the creation of homes near jobs and industry.”










Colorado is breaking down barriers to more housing people can afford and this one-stop shop will help make that possible in more communities across our state.


– Colorado Gov. Jared Polis


The Housing Hub is the first initiative to come from the Colorado Housing Consortium, a collaboration between over 100 entities in the private and public sectors looking to accelerate more affordable housing development in the state. 
A survey of those who applied for affordable housing tax credits in the last two years found that 85% of respondents wanted to see a statewide application to improve the process of applying for funding, according to a press release from Polis’ office. Applying through multiple funding sources dragged on build timelines and put affording housing projects at risk, according to 65% of survey respondents.  
“There is no greater need in Denver and Colorado than affordable housing, and no greater obstacle to our success than time,” Denver Mayor Mike Johnston said in a statement.
A second phase of the project will include a common application accepted by all agencies.
Polis has made “More Housing Now” a key goal throughout his second term as governor. Demographers estimate Colorado needs about 100,000 more units to meet the housing demand in the state.

(Courtesy photo)Parkersburg, West Virginia native, Reed Byers, believes that a small gesture, offered at the right moment, can cut through the kind of loneliness many people carry but often struggle to name. In West Virginia, where isolation is common and connection frequently feels like something one must earn, he learned early what it meant to grow up without the safety nets other places take for granted. So when a stranger wrapped him in a hug one morning at a Tudor’s Biscuit World in Huntington — no questions, no judgment — it landed with a force he couldn’t shake.
That moment didn’t solve anything outright, but it reframed something for Byers. After years of addiction, loss and rebuilding, he’d been carrying the quiet weight familiar to so many Americans, and particularly Appalachians, who navigate their hardest days alone. The simple act of someone pulling him in — just long enough to feel seen — became the seed of an idea he couldn’t ignore.
Today, that idea has taken shape as #1BillionHugs, a community-rooted effort built around human contact, mental health and the kind of everyday grace that rarely makes headlines. What started as a T-shirt with a catchy slogan has begun to spread across the state and beyond, carried by people who understand the power of a gesture that asks for nothing in return. And in a region where the struggle can be both connection and the chance to build a life that feels possible, Byers is betting that something as small and unguarded as a hug might change the way people feel about themselves, their neighbors, and the place they call home.

Full circles being what they are, Byers’ life didn’t follow a straight line. Born in Marietta, Ohio, he spent his early childhood in Parkersburg, where his father worked at a plant and his mother earned a nursing degree. 
“Before 13, I had a pretty decent childhood,” he said. “Yes, there was domestic violence and drug use, but when they were present, when they weren’t consumed with that, they were pretty good parents. I was involved in rec sports and extracurriculars and academic stuff, and I had clothes on my back.”
Everything shifted when the family broke apart. A volatile divorce sent him to North Carolina for several years — deepening the instability. His mother left the family for a drug dealer, falling deeper into addiction, and his father didn’t know how to cope. 
“Next thing you know, my brother’s 17 and catching a felony for trafficking weed. And here I am, watching all this happen at 13.”
Byers was the last in his immediate family to start using drugs — at 13. 
“It was sort of part of our family culture,” he said. 
He returned to West Virginia during high school, moving to St. Marys with his father. They smoked marijuana together until Byers realized he needed something different.
“I wanted to go to college. I was in youth leadership programs. I was on an academic team, a science bowl team. I really wanted to make a difference — pursue academic endeavors — but my lifestyle, family life, wasn’t really conducive to that.”
So Byers staged his own intervention — moving out, living with an aunt and finally landing in a small community outreach apartment where staff let him stay if he promised to attend school. 
“Which I did,” he said. “I was the first immediate sibling to graduate high school.” 
After graduation, he tried to cling to the few positive influences in his life, working briefly at Camp Horseshoe, where he’d seen a glimpse of structure and purpose.
College came next — West Virginia Wesleyan — though it didn’t last. Dropping out left him adrift. 
“I fell into the bar scene, eventually getting diagnosed with a mental illness, ending up homeless,” he said. “This pattern continued over the next four years in my early 20s — homelessness, mental illness, onset drug use.” 

The spiral deepened until, at 24, he was arrested in Ohio. 
“You go from smoking weed at 13 to trafficking meth at 24”

Called to create
Prison became the hard stop he never saw coming. And yet, even there, someone showed up for him.
“The only person that came and visited me at Noble Correctional Institution was my mentor, David King — the director of Camp Horseshoe in the Youth Leadership Association,” Byers said — noting that King had believed in him long before he believed in himself. “He used to drop off canned goods and books on the porch of the boarding house when I was in high school. This guy genuinely believed in me, saw potential in me. He came to my graduation and gave me “The Purpose Driven Life.”
In prison, King pushed Byers to see possibility. 
“He saw something in me that I didn’t see. He said, no, you’ve got a purpose. You see what’s not working. You’ve witnessed people around you lose their lives, take their lives, give it away and you’ve chosen your health instead.” 
Together, they sketched out the framework that would anchor Byers’ return to the world: a four-page plan of action: mind, spirit, body, relationships.
Upon returning home in 2020, Byers felt something unfamiliar — clarity. 
“I thought, I’ve really put my health together. I’d lost 60 pounds. I’d started working out and running. What do I want to do with my life?” The answer arrived quickly. “I wanted to be helpful. That was the answer.”
Byers took a job as a youth peer supporter at Westbrook Health Services — the same agency where he’d once been a patient. However, while the work was meaningful, he discovered the system wasn’t built for someone like him.
“Organizationally, the systems that exist that we’ve created are not meeting all of the needs in the communities,” he said. “You hired me to make a difference because of my lived experience, but now my lived experience is becoming a barrier.” 

Byers wasn’t allowed into high schools or the Boys & Girls Club because of his background. 
“These kids are often the ones going home to the harshest environments — sometimes wanting to take their own lives. We were receiving grant money from the state to solve these problems, but you’re telling me no.”
And so he left, determined to build something outside the limits of existing structures. He created a youth recovery initiative called How to Save a Life, developed programming, built an advisory team, raised funds, and was close to a $50,000 pilot. But still, something felt misaligned. 
“Even working underneath an existing nonprofit wasn’t the best fit because I’m called to go and build my own thing. I can work well with people. I just think I’m called to create and not necessarily fit inside of a container.”
Byers pivoted again — this time into a new identity. 
“I ended up opening a business as a motivational speaker,” he said. “I’ve been operating that for over three years now — it’s been very successful.” 

He’s spoken to mental health organizations, high school assemblies, civic groups, health departments, universities and tens of thousands online. His message is simple and relentless: Recovery is possible. Yes, you can do it. Take care of your mind, spirit, body. And we are all responsible in our community for affecting the change that we believe in. Nobody’s coming to save us.

 More than a brand

At this point in his life, two things stand out most for Byers when thinking about West Virginia: the depth of its people and the limits of opportunity. 
“It doesn’t seem like there’s ever enough resources,” he said. 
In his attempts to crack the code, Byers has served on nonprofit boards, built volunteer movements, run for office, and eventually held a seat on the Cabell County Board of Education. 
“Our budget was $150 million and we still couldn’t pay our teachers enough to not want go to Ohio or Kentucky or Virginia,” he indicated. “To me, that’s unacceptable.”
So he asked himself what most people in his position eventually ask: What can I do that actually changes anything? He was already speaking professionally, consulting with nonprofits, and stepping into places where lived experience and clarity carried weight. But he wanted something bigger than speeches and incremental change.
“What if I started a business and found a real way to drive revenue that we could then invest in our region to solve the same social challenges I’ve been trying to solve for five years?” he said. “Mental health, suicide, addiction, recovery, lack of economic opportunity, poor health metrics, obesity, et cetera. How do we solve this holistic slew of social challenges in a simple and focused way through a business?”
The answer came in a way he didn’t expect. 
“God put it on my heart that we could do that through essentially selling ‘Free Hugs’ T-shirts,” he said. “But the movement is so much bigger than that.”
What emerged was #1BillionHugs — not an apparel line, but a human-scale intervention. 
“The endeavor came to mind as a way to promote this wearable symbol of hope,” Byers said. “To catalyze connection with individuals and, in that connected moment, to be a reason that people want to stay on this planet.”
He knows exactly what that moment can do. 
“I was wearing a Free Hugs T-shirt years ago, and I had wanted to take my life. I showed up at a Tudor’s Biscuit World to kind of self-medicate with food. And a woman behind the counter was jumping up and down pointing at her chest, and I realized she was motioning at the front of my shirt. So I said, ‘Come on out here.’ And she gave me a big-old hug. She said, ‘You don’t know how bad I needed that.’ And I told her I needed it too.”
He sat down afterward, still shaken, and another couple approached him. 
“They said, ‘We really appreciate you wearing that shirt.’ And I knew in that moment it was more than just a shirt. I was showing up imperfect, hadn’t shaved, hadn’t showered, had been in bed for a couple days — I knew that I was good enough to make a difference. And in that moment of connection, I didn’t want to take my life anymore.”
For Byers, that was the blueprint. 
“This isn’t like building an apparel brand,” he said. “This is a movement to get a billion people hugging more — to create a billion reasons to stay on this planet. Because if a billion people are engaged in connection, you’re going to have less suicide, improved mental health, improved psyche and rapport in your communities. You’re going to take better care of your physical health, have increased economic opportunities, increased collaboration.”

Further proof
When Byers first imagined #1BillionHugs as an actual brand, the vision arrived all at once. 
“I thought, wow, you can count hugs essentially by people using the hashtag,” he said. “Which made me think about scale. What does that mean, a billion hugs? What would it take to get there? Maybe you have a hug counter. Maybe selling a billion shirts will also help you get there.”

His own willingness to learn became the driving force. 
“I also had to ask myself if I was willing to commit my life to it,” he said. “Was I willing to keep going until we get to a billion and this becomes my life’s work?” 
Ultimately, an injury forced him to slow down — and build. 
“I blew my knee out and I had to sit down,” he said. “Thankfully, having surgery allowed me to get to work on the website.”

A collection of different designers finally got the logo to his liking. The first shirt design emerged. 
“I was consulting with people in my network for six months.” 

The first pre-order was printed through Mountain Mindful at Coalfield Development, but Byers quickly realized he needed a different long-term partner. A chance meeting with a local pastor introduced him to a young Marshall student running his own print shop.
Soon after, the website launched in August. And the response was immediate. 
“We did 117 units in our four-week pre-order,” he added. “We had so much response from the press — a TV commercial, a segment on WSAZ, a couple different press publications. I spoke on a global mental wellness summit. Boys & Girls Club published our release. I got to speak at the West Virginia Goes Purple Fest. We’ve had so many hug ambassadors and people supporting the movement, and we’re not even three months in.”
Further proof, for Byers, that the need is real. 
“People are hungry for connection. People want to support organizations like the Boys & Girls Club and the Youth Leadership Association — where 10% of our proceeds go to.”
All the while, he knows that pace is the lesson. 
“Rome wasn’t built in a day. Nike did $6,000 in their first year. Twenty thousand in their second. I’m confident we’re going to do better than both of those numbers. But we don’t expect a billion in a year. I’ve learned to move at a sustainable pace versus all-or-nothing.”
Operationally, #1BillionHugs is obviously quite young, but the movement has already spread farther than Byers expected. “That first four-week pre-order went all over the nation,” he said. 

Most of the early response has come through online marketing and the Shopify store that feeds directly into the website. There, supporters can track their own hugs on the site’s counters, join a Facebook group where people share photos and stories, and contribute to a business page that is approaching its first thousand followers.
Byers has also assembled what he calls “hug hustlers” — brand ambassadors who help sell shirts, give hugs and spread the message. 
“We do accept applications for new hug hustlers,” he said. “We do want to engage with volunteers. We’re working on how that can be more formal and streamlined, because it’s mostly just me right now in terms of managing the operations.”

A new story 
Byers is building the kind of partnerships he believes will ground the movement in communities. 
“I’ve met with nine pastors — trying to figure out how the message fits with churches,” he said — while simultaneously thinking carefully about how to involve schools in the future. “I’ve been hesitant to introduce it directly into schools so far, just because of the physical consent piece. You don’t want to spark anything that’s inappropriate, but you do want the kids to know that they’re loved, welcomed, and valued.”
The project donates 10% of its proceeds to charity partners — the Boys & Girls Club and the Youth Leadership Association — and Byers sent each a check recently.
“It’s $150 to each of those organizations — so $300 total we’ve donated just from August. It’s not a ton of money, but for me, as a person who came from tough circumstances, from the streets, no shoes, it means a lot. It shows me the vehicle that I was led to create, that people invested in, is producing fruit.”
As for explaining how #1BillionHugs fits into Appalachia, Byers doesn’t hesitate. 
“This state, region, all of it — we have our different social challenges, but there is a massive amount of social capital. Kindness.”
He’s seen it everywhere he goes. “It’s challenging for me to go anywhere in the state and not see somebody that I know,” he said — admitting that wearing the shirt opens new connections instantly — sometimes with people he didn’t realize he already shared community with. 
“Like the day I hugged a stranger who turned out to be the new director of the West Virginia Community Development Hub.”
Ultimately, Byers affirmed, Appalachia is where the idea emerged, and where the need feels most urgent. 
“My family has been plagued by mental illness and addiction,” he said. “I’ve lost a number of people who are very close to me — my brother, my mother, my best friend. Several of my classmates in high school to suicide and addiction. This place is where the idea met me and where its biggest and greatest impact will be carried out.”

Accordingly, he finds proof of concept wherever he goes. 
“People will share their stories, their personal connection to addiction, their personal connection to mental illness — to suicide,” he said. “I’m continuously amazed by what comes up when I just wear these shirts and live out the mission.” 
Among his greatest challenges at this point is a lack of personnel. 
“I’m extroverted by nature — and not having a fortified enough internal team or system to brainstorm and hash these ideas out has been tough,” he said. “And I can admit an occasional lack of emotional or mental fortitude in terms of being able to live out this dream optimally. But the greater point is that I continue showing up.”
For Byers, the future depends on him showing up. And when he pictures success five or 10 years down the road, it’s not about a number on a hug counter. 
“It goes beyond that,” he said. “I see the young people that look like I once did — on the west side of Charleston, or Parkersburg, or up in the hills of Preston County. The ones who need loving, caring, supportive adults. And because they might not have access to that, they’re ending up on the wrong path.”
Success, to him, is both simple and sophisticated. “It’s about being a presence in those areas and many more like them — seeing how all of the young people are supported and cared for. So they don’t have to go down the same path I did, which led to incarceration. So they don’t end up lonely, isolated or taking their lives like so many of my friends have.”
Byers describes #1BillionHugs as the front end of a comprehensive effort. 
“We get people hugging, we sell the merchandise, we create the revenue, and we invest that back into Appalachia,” he said. “If it works, the region becomes something people haven’t seen in generations. Appalachia becomes a beacon of hope. Where people want to move, want to stay, where people aren’t in despair, and where people are healing and healed and sharing that healing with others.”
To see that happen, to help build it, Byers said, “… is how I would define success.”

(Photo courtesy of Jake Lowenstern/USGS)Today, Mars is a cold and dry planet with a very thin, low-pressure atmosphere. It has water, but it’s all frozen, locked up in underground ice (like permafrost) and in polar ice caps.
But billions of years ago Mars had a thicker atmosphere and a warmer and wetter climate. It also used to have active volcanoes. So, with all that heat, and all that water, is it possible that there were once hot springs on Mars? And how could we find out?
Mars has been a fascination for centuries, with early telescopic observations and fantastically speculative (and as it turns out, fictional) stories about possible canals and intelligent life forms. Modern Mars exploration began in the 1960s with spacecraft flybys, then in the following decades with orbiters, landers and finally robotic rovers.
There are currently seven active spacecraft orbiting Mars and two robotic “geologists” roving the surface, named Curiosity and Perseverance.
With all the images and data collected by these satellites and robotic explorers, we now have a good idea of what Mars is like on the surface.
There is no evidence for canals or complex lifeforms, but there is plenty of evidence for active surface processes, like wind, dust devils, migrating sand dunes and landslides. There is also evidence for past volcanism, such as large volcanoes and lava flows, and evidence for past flowing liquid water, such as river channels and delta deposits.
The evidence for past liquid water also includes a variety of hydrated minerals, hydrothermal alteration minerals, and silica deposits. It’s the silica deposits, discovered in 2007 by the Mars Exploration Rover, Spirit, that make you sit up and say, “Wow! Like in Yellowstone?”
Most of the silica deposits in Yellowstone are made of a white, lightweight, porous rock composed of opaline silica. The silica is dissolved from the rhyolitic volcanic rocks below and picked up by the hydrothermal fluids circulating underground.
When the hot, silica-rich fluids reach the surface, they cool down and precipitate layered silica deposits and mounds, called sinter, around geysers and hot springs.
There is also another way to get silica-rich deposits: acid-sulfate leaching. This is where sulfuric acid from volcanic gases reacts with the surrounding silicate rocks near the surface, leaching (removing) metal compounds, like iron and magnesium, and leaving a residue of opaline silica.
On Mars, silica deposits were found adjacent to a site dubbed Home Plate, within a large impact crater called Gusev crater, and there is evidence they formed from hydrothermal fluids. A key observation is the association of the silica deposits with volcanic activity.
The Home Plate feature represents the remains of volcanic ash deposits, which, along with nearby basaltic rocks, demonstrates that this place had magmatic activity capable of generating a hydrothermal system, although much smaller than the one that drives Yellowstone’s hot springs and fumaroles.
Because sinter deposits on Earth often host microbial life, they are a key target in the search for evidence of ancient microbial life on Mars. Excitingly, the silica deposits discovered by Spirit display tiny fingerlike structures that resemble features of Yellowstone sinter and other sinter deposits on Earth that are referred to as stromatolites, which form by a combination of biology and geology.
The colorful microbial communities that inhabit the edges and outflow channels of hot springs contribute to the growth of stromatolites along with the silica that precipitates from the water. The fingerlike structures observed by Spirit are made of silica, but they have not been shown to include organic matter and may not be equivalent to hot spring stromatolites on Earth.
At this point, they are assumed to have formed from geologic processes alone.

Image modified from Ruff et al., 2020 (https://doi.org/10.1089/ast.2019.2044).
Still, understanding microorganisms that inhabit Yellowstone’s hot springs, and the evidence they leave behind, could help answer some fundamental questions in the field of astrobiology: Is there, or has there ever been, life elsewhere in the solar system?
Going beyond Mars, there is also evidence of geyser activity on some of the icy moons in the outer solar system, such as Neptune’s moon, Triton, and Saturn’s moon, Enceladus. Jupiter’s moon, Europa, is another outer solar system body that has a liquid water ocean underneath its crust of water ice and may host geysers that are spurting out samples of this water.
In October 2024, NASA launched the Europa Clipper mission to investigate. It will arrive in 2030. Stay tuned.
Yellowstone is not just a natural laboratory for Earth science studies. With its history of caldera-forming volcanism, geothermal activity, geysers, hydrothermal mineral deposits, and thermophilic bacteria, it is also an excellent laboratory for exciting planetary science research.

CENTRAL CITY — As Gwen Clements walks through the building where her fledgling nonprofit is making its home, she sees the work that’s still ahead. 
The corroded electrical wiring inside the small building along Everly Brothers Boulevard needs to be replaced. Ceiling panels are drooping. Signs among the racks of clothes and toiletries still point to where customers could once shop for pumps and filters at the former pool supply store. 
“A little disheartened,” said Clements when asked by a first-time visitor how she was feeling about the place on a recent November afternoon. “But we’ll get there.” 
She also says they’ve come a long way. 
The Lantern reported earlier this year about Clements’ efforts in Muhlenberg County in the series “No Kentucky Home.” Clements started a Facebook group in 2024 that helped bring together people seeking to provide money, food, shelter and other support for their neighbors experiencing homelessness. That loose coalition has now become the Breakthrough Base of Muhlenberg County, a nonprofit formed in May. Clements serves as its vice president. 
The goal: Create a resource hub where people experiencing homelessness can get a hot meal, a shower, do some laundry and get help with paperwork to get an I.D. card. There’s no shower installed yet, nor a kitchen space — but they have a building. Clements previously said she was inspired by another nonprofit in Somerset that’s become a shelter and hub for homeless people. 
Donna Vincent, middle, is one of a number of people experiencing homelessness that the Breakthrough Base of Muhlenberg County has helped so far. Vincent has been sleeping in her car. Cyndi Aday, left, and Gwen Clements, right, stand next to her.
She said the official nonprofit, which is leasing the building in Central City, has gotten more support from the community than when it was an unofficial group organizing through Facebook. She felt, in the past, local homeless people were met with apathy, or at times disregard, from local officials. The work of the nonprofit has “been welcomed.” 
“Everybody says this is such a needed program, that what we’re doing is such a needed thing in Muhlenberg County,” Clements said. “That feels good. Because two years ago, a year ago — I didn’t feel that way.”
Local people experiencing homelessness who were at the building on this recent November day say the nonprofit is providing resources that haven’t been available in their Western Kentucky county, along with a community space where they can exist without apprehension.
‘A place to just be’
The nonprofit has volunteers, clothing, food, and appliances — but it still likely needs thousands of dollars for renovations. That’s why Breakthrough Base was raffling off an expensive hunting bow, offering donated chili from the nearby Wendy’s and giving away winter clothes on a November weekend to try to meet the gap. The 501(c)(3) nonprofit has also been gathering donations through online accounts with PayPal, Venmo and Cash App.on their Facebook page.
Mary Luenebrink, 44, sat in a chair near tables of winter clothing, having walked over from the tent where she had been sleeping. She mentioned how it’s hard to stay clean or “go to the bathroom” when living outside.

“Being able to come up here, it helps. It keeps you out of your head,” Luenebrink said, mentioning she had been seeing a therapist from the Pennyroyal Center inside the building. “They got big hearts to do something like this, to get it off the ground.” 
The building, with its blemishes, is also becoming a community space for local homeless people.
Cyndi Aday, the nonprofit’s food director, said that on some mornings volunteers have pulled up and found  people sitting outside “just waiting for us to open.” Sometimes it’s raining with no place to go outside of their tents, she said, so they come to the storefront. 
“They just hang out,” Aday said. “It gives them a place to just be.” 
Even though the hours of operation are limited to a few in the middle of the day, Aday said she tries to stay longer to talk with the people they’re helping. It helps build relationships, she said, and it gives them something to do.
Some of those in need of shelter pitch in to help with tasks around the building, said Clements. “They feel productive, and they feel like they’re doing something that matters.”
The community space — and the outreach from it —  also give the new nonprofit the opportunity to connect with more people in the homeless community, including those who are ashamed to show up at the building but instead contact Clements personally. 
“They’re afraid to reach out. They’re afraid to be judged. I tell them, ‘There’s no judgment with us,’” Clements said. “That’s the hidden homelessness.” 
The work before winter
In the back of the building is a cavernous garage that was once filled with pool liners and other supplies and is now an empty concrete floor. What Clements imagines it could be: a “white flag” or overnight warming shelter for when temperatures are dangerously cold and people need to move inside to stay safe.
The wooden roof has water damage that needs repair, Clements said, along with a space needing insulation. Clements isn’t entirely confident they can get the space ready for the upcoming winter. 
The converted storefront is next door to the Central Inn, a motel where Clements and others have rented rooms — with crowdfunded money raised through her Facebook group — for people experiencing homelessness during cold weather. 
“I just didn’t want to do another winter of motel rooms, and it’s already looking like that’s where we’re at,” Clements said.

She’s not sure if her community, the place where she grew up, would support a more comprehensive emergency shelter that would operate year-round as some are operating in other parts of the state. Clements also feels that much of her community’s challenge with rural homelessness would be alleviated by building and repairing more affordable housing in Muhlenberg County.
Kentucky’s housing shortage
Kentucky is grappling with a significant housing shortage in both urban and rural communities; the gap of more than 200,000 housing units is expected to grow if no action is taken. A national research firm had estimated Muhlenberg County, with a little over 30,000 people, had a housing gap of 952 units in 2024. State lawmakers have been looking at ways to build more housing through easing regulations and providing tax breaks for housing developers.
KY task force recommends easing regulation, more funding to address housing shortage

“We need permanent housing solutions and we need a better crisis response system across the board,” said Adrienne Bush, executive director of the advocacy group Homeless and Housing Coalition of Kentucky. She praised efforts to prevent people from dying during extreme weather as well as a year-round approach of connecting people to housing.
The number of people experiencing homelessness across the state has also grown. The annual nationwide survey tracked a more than a 10% increase in people experiencing homelessness in Kentucky from January 2024 to January 2025. The steepest increase was outside Lexington and Louisville. Volunteers and agency outreach workers counted 5,789 individuals who lacked “a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence,” the federal definition of homeless used for the survey.
The survey counted eight people experiencing homelessness in Muhlenberg County in January 2025. Clements, who helped with the count, believes that number is higher. Her nonprofit plans to start keeping detailed demographic records of each person they help to better exemplify the local need when asking for grant funding. 
She said it’s that need for funding that is holding the nonprofit back. But that hasn’t stopped them. 
“As far as helping people, we are helping them. We are helping them every day. We have a lot of contacts every day with different people, and sometimes they just need some information” about helpful agencies, Clements said. 
Clements feels a responsibility to see the efforts of the nonprofit through, feeling more responsibility now that a part of the loose coalition helping others has moved into the storefront. She also worries about the precedent that could be set. 
“We have got to succeed. We can’t fail,” Clements said. “If we fail, there’ll never be anything else to come about to help the people in Muhlenberg County, the unfortunate people.”

(Getty Images)A multi-million dollar proposal designed to rehabilitate Pennsylvania’s aging housing stock failed to receive funding in the state’s 2025-2026 budget — marking the third year without a state-funded successor to the popular Whole Home Repair Program.
Sen. Nikil Saval (D-Philadelphia) said that the thousands of Pennsylvanians on waitlists across the state “vastly understates the need,” since many counties closed theirs after distributing funds.
“We know that there is immense demand for the home repair program,” Saval told the Capital-Star. 
Saval and Sen. David Argall (R-Schuylkill) sponsored the bill to create the PA Home Preservation Program in the Senate, while a trio of bipartisan House lawmakers introduced its companion bill in their chamber. The House version passed 122-80, only to stall in the Senate along with Saval’s effort. 
Gov. Josh Shapiro earmarked $50 million for the state program in his proposed budget, but the request quietly disappeared after a monthslong impasse that concluded earlier this month.

“Our best guess is that there were a lot of funding priorities in this budget and when it came to coming up with the funding number, they did not find money for this program,” said Saval. “Frankly, they didn’t find money for virtually any housing program, and that’s really unfortunate given the nature and scale of the housing crisis.” 
A similar, federal effort dubbed the ROAD to Housing Bill is still moving as part of the National Defense Authorization Act, which passed the U.S. Senate in October. The Whole-Home Repairs Act under that proposal would allow the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to establish a five-year pilot program to offer grants and forgivable loans to low- and moderate-income homeowners alongside qualified landlords. 
 Program details

Only a sliver of the 17,000 applicants — 3,965 homeowners — got a share of the $125 million Whole Home Repairs Program’s funding, according to the state Department of Community and Economic Development.
Just three counties have spent all of their program funds before the Jan. 31, 2026 deadline: Bradford, Cameron and McKean. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Cliff Clark, the director of Cameron County Community and Economic Development, oversaw how the $200,000 awarded to his county was spent. He said the funding quickly went to four homes on an existing housing repair list maintained by the county. 
“Our housing stock is old. That’s not to say it’s deteriorated, but it’s old,” said Clark. “One of our goals is to try to improve the housing stock … we’re doing, I think, a very good job making houses that aren’t otherwise marketable, desirable.” 
The program limited individual home projects to $50,000, a number Clark said could be higher if a similar effort is approved on the state level. For example, he noted a new boiler for some homes could cost as much as $20,000.
“Costs have increased so much that we’re only able to do about half of the homes we used to be able to do. I used to do 10 to 12 homes a year and now I’m doing about five. So if you’re number 50 on my waiting list, you’ve got a 10-year wait,” said Clark. 
Part of the bottleneck in the county is due to a shortage of contractors, Clark said, which is a statewide problem meant to be addressed with workforce development funds. Under Whole Home Repair, $4.9 million has been spent on scholarships, training programs and more.
Tom Stark, speaking on behalf of the County Commissioners Association of Pennsylvania, told the Capital-Star workforce development was a difficult component for many counties, particularly those that didn’t have existing workforce programs. 
“With the trades, in general, finding workforce in a timely fashion and getting a contractor out there to actually conduct the work?” Stark said. “There aren’t as many out there as there used to be.”
 What other funding is out there?

Prior to Whole Home Repair, Stark said counties had access to a variety of different assistance programs — both state and federal. He highlighted the commonwealth’s Weatherization Assistance Program as one used to make homes more energy efficient. 
For example, replacing windows under the initiative was a popular use of funds, but had its shortcomings.
“The challenge is if you go to a home and they need a window repair, but you know they need a roof first, there really wasn’t funding for that,” Stark said. “Whole Homes came in to fill that gap.”
He said that funds for landlords were “underutilized,” noting the additional requirements. To qualify for a forgivable loan of up to $50,000, landlords must own no more than five properties and no more than 15 rental units.
The unit’s current tenant must also get a three-year lease extension and annual rent increases cannot exceed 3%. In addition to owning the unit for at least 15 years, landlords must not have any serious code violations during that time. 
 


				By the numbers:
Roughly $3.7 million, or 3%, of the initial $125 million allocation went to the state for administrative costs, leaving $121.3 million to be distributed to counties, according to the state Department of Community and Economic Development.
Of that $121.3 million, $89.6 million has been committed to the following categories:

$75.7 million in homeowner grants (including small landlords)
$5.9 million on provision and enhancement 
$3.2 million on county-level administrative costs
$4.9 million on workforce development

 



Clark said Cameron County also receives grant funding from HUD’s HOME Investment Partnerships Program, which allocates billions of dollars for affordable housing across the nation. HOME can cover housing repairs, but restricts some repairs on homes in floodplains and requires an environmental review. 
The Whole Homes Repair program had neither restriction, Clark said, nor did it enforce HUD’s minimum standards for repairs — a benchmark Clark said he still followed for his county’s projects and believed should be implemented for others.
Overall, he called the WHRP “a very easy program to administer” and an “economic driver” for his community. 
“We get $200,000 and all of that money goes right back into the economy,” he said. “We hire local contractors and I’d say probably 80% to 90% of supplies are purchased locally as well.”
The state’s proposed home preservation program could become more important if federal funding gets cut. The Trump administration has proposed zeroing out funding for the HOME program, meaning that communities could miss out on funds for future repairs or affordable housing initiatives.

(Photo courtesy of Lake Cumberland Somerset-Pulaski Tourism)For the first time in living memory, families leaving Eastern Kentucky’s coalfield counties are more likely to resettle in Somerset or London than Cincinnati or Detroit. The Hillbilly Highway that once carried millions north has given way to a profoundly local pattern of movement — short hops between Kentucky counties rather than the exodus that once defined Appalachia.
The shift is visible in tax return data: Between 2021 and 2022, roughly 3 out of every 4 people who moved from Eastern Kentucky stayed within state borders. In some counties, the figure reached 90%
This represents a historic reversal. During the 1950s and 1960s, two-thirds of all moves out of Eastern Kentucky crossed state lines, bound for factory towns in Ohio, Michigan, and Illinois. Today, the same proportion stays home.
The new migration map: Staying close, moving often
The latest migration statistics from the Internal Revenue Service — which tracks household addresses through annual tax filings  — reveal Eastern Kentucky’s transformation from a region of exodus to one of circulation.
Analysis of the 2021-22 data for 10 Eastern Kentucky counties shows that when residents move, they overwhelmingly relocate nearby. These are intra-Kentucky migration rates for 2021-22.

Knott County: 90% stayed in Kentucky
Breathitt County: 90% stayed in Kentucky
Perry County: 77% stayed in Kentucky
Laurel County: 77% stayed in Kentucky
Floyd County: 75% stayed in Kentucky
Letcher County: 64% stayed in Kentucky
Harlan County: 62% stayed in Kentucky
Pulaski County: 63% stayed in Kentucky
Pike County: 54% stayed in Kentucky
Bell County: 46% stayed in Kentucky

Even Pike County — Kentucky’s easternmost and once among its most outmigration-heavy counties — now sends more than half its departing households to other Kentucky destinations rather than out of state.
Two counties actually growing
While most Eastern Kentucky counties continue to lose population, two regional hubs have reversed course entirely. Pulaski and Laurel counties — home to Somerset and London, respectively — posted net migration gains in 2021-22.
Laurel and Pulaski counties gained population in 2021-22. Note: “People” is calculated from tax exemptions; represents approximate individual migration. (Source: IRS Statistics of Income, County-to-County Migration Data, 2021-2022. )
What makes Pulaski and Laurel attractive? Both sit along Interstate 75, Kentucky’s economic spine. Both have regional medical centers — Lake Cumberland Regional Hospital in Somerset, Saint Joseph London — that serve as major employers. Both host community college campuses. And both offer what demographers call “amenity migration” — access to retail, restaurants, broadband internet and proximity to the region without its remoteness.
Pike County tells a different story. While it posted a net loss of 187 households, the data reveals significant churn: 680 households moved in even as 867 moved out. Unlike the one-way departures of the 1950s, Pike now functions as part of a regional circulation system, drawing workers from neighboring Floyd and Letcher counties while sending residents to Lexington’s Fayette County for education and specialized employment.
Why the pattern changed
Several forces explain the shift from exodus to local circulation:

Economic collapse of the industrial Midwest. The auto plants, tire factories and steel mills that once pulled Appalachians north have largely closed. Rust Belt cities no longer promise prosperity; many former migrants have returned as retirees or disability recipients.
Regional health care consolidation. As rural hospitals close, residents must relocate to maintain access to medical care, but they move to the nearest hub with a hospital, not to another state.
The power of proximity. Extended family networks remain paramount in Appalachian culture. Even struggling economically, residents prefer to stay within visiting distance of parents, siblings and grandchildren.
Digital infrastructure. Improved broadband access in counties like Pulaski has enabled white-collar workers to live in small towns while working remotely for employers based elsewhere—a pandemic-era pattern that persists.
Interstate 75 and I-64. Kentucky’s two major interstates have created development corridors that capture migration within the state. Families leaving remote hollows now stop in London or Somerset rather than continuing north.

The great exodus: 1950-1980
To understand how dramatic today’s inward turn is, consider what came before.
Between 1950 and 1970, approximately 3 million people left the Appalachian region — one of the largest peacetime internal migrations in American history. Eastern Kentucky bore disproportionate losses.
Between 1950 and 1980, four coalfield counties lost approximately 105,000 residents—more than 40% of their population. (Source: U.S. Census)
These weren’t statistical abstractions. They represented schools closing, businesses shuttering, churches emptying and Main Streets dying. Graduating seniors in Eastern Kentucky schools had the choice of either college or migrating to Cincinnati or Detroit, seeking factory wages their home counties could not provide.
The routes they traveled — U.S. 23 from Pikeville north through Ashland into Ohio; U.S. 25 from southeastern Kentucky into Ohio’s industrial corridor — became known as the Hillbilly Highway. By the 1970s, Cincinnati’s Over-the-Rhine neighborhood, Akron’s North Hill, Detroit’s southern suburbs and Chicago’s Uptown housed substantial Appalachian enclaves.
The Urban Appalachian Council, founded in Cincinnati in 1974, documented the challenges these migrants faced: discrimination, culture shock, housing insecurity and persistent poverty despite steady factory work. But they kept coming because the coal economy at home was mechanizing rapidly, eliminating thousands of jobs even as production remained stable.
Return migration: 1980s reversal
Starting in the late 1980s, the flow began to slow and partially reverse. As Rust Belt factories shuttered — victims of automation, foreign competition and the North American Free Trade Agreement — laid-off workers trickled back to Kentucky.
The reversal: In the 1950s-60s, two-thirds of Eastern Kentuckians who moved left the state. Today, three-quarters stay within Kentucky.
The Urban Appalachian Council tracked this “return migration” through the 1990s. But returnees came back to retire or live on disability, not to work. Eastern Kentucky’s coal economy had continued to decline, leaving few employment opportunities for prime-age workers.
This return flow represented adjustment, not revival. The net outmigration slowed, but counties continued to lose population overall. What’s different about the 2020s pattern is that families are choosing to stay within the region even when economic conditions remain difficult.
Migration as adaptation
Today’s Eastern Kentucky migration reflects neither the desperate escape of the 1950s nor the hopeful return of the 1990s. Instead, it reveals pragmatic adaptation: families seeking health care, housing or marginally better job prospects while maintaining ties to home.
This pattern appears in the granular data. When Harlan County residents move, they most often relocate to neighboring Bell County or to Lexington. When Floyd County residents move, they head to Pike County or Fayette County. When Perry County residents leave, they resettle in nearby counties or Lexington.
Percentage of outmigrants moving to other Kentucky counties (2021-22). In 9 of 10 counties studied, most migrants now relocate within Kentucky rather than out of state.
The moves are incremental, one county over, perhaps two. They maintain the possibility of weekend visits, Sunday dinners and participation in family life. They preserve cultural connection even as they seek economic improvement.
Whether this represents resilience or resignation depends on perspective. Optimists see families finding creative ways to stay rooted despite persistent poverty. Pessimists note that regional opportunities remain limited, forcing even short-distance moves as acts of survival rather than choice.
What it means
The shift from exodus to circulation has reshaped Eastern Kentucky in ways both subtle and profound:

Regional hubs matter more. Counties with hospitals, colleges, and interstate access now function as population anchors, drawing residents from surrounding counties while losing fewer to distant cities.
Family networks persist. Unlike the mid-century generation that often severed ties with Kentucky, today’s movers remain embedded in regional social networks, maintaining connections across county lines.
The diaspora isn’t growing. With less outmigration to Rust Belt cities, the Appalachian diaspora communities in Ohio, Michigan and Illinois are aging and shrinking. The next generation is staying home — or at least staying closer.
Kentucky captures more of its talent. Young people leaving Pike or Harlan counties now often stop in Lexington rather than continuing to Columbus or Nashville, keeping their economic contributions within state borders.
Return migration continues. Retirees from the diaspora continue trickling back, though at modest levels and with limited economic impact.

The unfinished story
The inward turn of Appalachian migration reflects both progress and persistent challenge. The hemorrhage has stopped, but the region hasn’t healed.
Most Eastern Kentucky counties continue to lose population, just more slowly and to closer destinations than before. Birth rates have plummeted as young women leave or delay childbearing. Natural decrease — more deaths than births — now compounds outmigration in counties like Harlan and Letcher.
But the shift toward intra-regional migration suggests something important: Eastern Kentuckians still value home. They move when necessary, but they move as little as necessary. They seek better opportunities, but they define “better” to include proximity to family, familiarity with place and maintenance of cultural connection.
The great midcentury exodus told a story of abandonment, of mountain people forced to become city people in search of survival. Today’s quieter pattern tells a different story — one of adaptation, persistence and stubborn attachment to place.
The Hillbilly Highway has become a country road in Kentucky, winding through the mountains rather than leaving them behind. 



About the data 
The IRS migration dataset tracks household address changes between tax filings, providing the most comprehensive county-to-county migration data available. “Returns” approximate households; “exemptions” approximate individuals. Data reflect moves between filing 2020 returns (calendar year 2021) and 2021 returns (calendar year 2022).
Historical population figures for 1950-1980 come from decennial census counts. Net migration estimates account for natural increase (births minus deaths) to isolate migration effects.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Feeling anxious about how to pay for your winter heating bill? You’re not alone, according to the latest Ocean State Poll from the University of New Hampshire Survey Center, which found roughly 78% of Rhode Islanders feel the same way about their upcoming winter heating bills. 
Unease over heating prices has risen since last November, when UNH researchers found 70% of residents were worried about their winter energy bills. Among the anxious, 40% said they were “very worried,” while 37% were “worried.” 
And that worry was expressed across each of the three voter affiliations used in the survey released Nov. 25 — Democrat, Republican and independent — expressed being “worried” or “very worried.” That included 88% of independents, 83% of Democrats, and 61% of Republicans.
Independents, or unaffiliated voters, comprised the overall survey’s largest share at about 51% of the total of 711 residents surveyed. The survey was conducted online between Nov. 13 and 17.
The worries are not abstract, as evidenced by Federal Energy Information Administration data which shows Rhode Island home heating oil prices at about $3.88 a gallon in the last week of November 2025. That’s up from the same time last year, when a gallon of oil cost about $3.52. It’s also significantly above pandemic-era November 2020, when heating oil cost about $2.31 a gallon in Rhode Island. 
Heating oil is, however, still below the heights achieved in the fall of 2022, when October and November oil prices regularly soared above $5 a gallon, almost reaching $5.89 in the last week of October 2022.
Propane has been similarly expensive in recent years, with federal data showing residential propane averages about $3.56 a gallon on Nov. 24, 2025, comparable to the $3.61 per gallon recorded in the same time period in November 2024, but still above the high-$2.80s of late 2020. Like oil, propane prices spiked in fall 2022, regularly reaching the $3.80s in October and November of that year. 
The day after the poll was released, Rhode Island Energy submitted a request to increase service charges for gas and electric customers in an application submitted to the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission. If approved, the proposed new distribution rates which would take effect in September 2026 would increase the average residential electric bill by about $7.78 a month, while a typical gas customer would pay $343.53 more annually, a 20.6% jump.
Gloomy on the economy
Rhode Islanders’ concerns about heating bills are embedded in a larger pessimism about the economy at large, with only 13% of the 711 respondents surveyed saying their household is financially better off than it was a year ago.  
“Rhode Islanders are generally downbeat on the state and national economies, as a majority feel that the economy is getting worse,” the survey’s introduction states.
Another 40% of respondents said their household was financially worse off than a year ago, while 47% did not discern any substantial change in their household finances over the previous 12 months. Half of respondents who identified as Democrats felt their households were worse off, while only 24% of Republicans did.  
“The fact that they were so close together, was surprising to me,” Rep. Teresa Tanzi, a South Kingstown Democrat, said after she looked over the poll results. ”Normally I would say, ‘Oh, it’s a partisan thing,’ but clearly this is something that is impacting all people.”
Tanzi, known as a strong advocate for energy affordability, noted that in Washington County, which includes the district she represents, just under half of people were “very worried” about energy costs, higher than any other county in the state.
“I certainly hear it from my neighbors,” Tanzi said. 
The poll found about 40% of households making under $75,000 a year and 54% of households making under $45,000 annually said they were worse off financially than last year. 
The sample’s largest of six income demographics — households making over $150,000 annually, which accounted for 135 respondents — said they had stayed the same since last year at 56%, although equal amounts of 22% thought they were better or worse off from last year. 
The survey does show that broader pessimism about the macroeconomic picture has shrunk somewhat in the past six months, slightly more so when looking toward the future. When the survey center asked the same questions of Rhode Islanders back in May, 45% of respondents expected to be financially worse off a year from now. In the new survey, that number has fallen to 35%, and an additional 21% of respondents think they will be better off in a year. The other 45% expect to be in roughly the same place financially.
Affordability concerns are more than a seasonal trend, said Camilo Viveiros, executive director of the George Wiley Center in Pawtucket, a nonprofit which advocates for low-income Rhode Islanders.
Viveiros pointed to percentage of income payment plans (PIPP), which would cap bills according to a fixed percentage of a customer’s income. A bill to institute PIPP in Rhode Island was submitted by Democratic Rep. Scott Slater of Providence early in the 2025 legislative session, but it failed to move out of committee. 
“The George Wiley Center urges public officials to listen to our calls to restructure rates for long term affordability,” Viveiros said in an email Friday, adding that “it is time” for state officials “who profess to care about affordability to lend their support for the PIPP proposal.” 
He also pointed to a policy brief recently published Nov. 20 by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, which pointed to PIPP as a means to “restructure rates for long term affordability.”
The brief noted that a broader Federal Poverty Line benchmark would apply to PIPP eligibility and could be optimized if paired with the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, which is a federal program.
In fiscal year 2025, Rhode Island received nearly $27 million in LIHEAP funding, which helps low-income families with a one-time seasonal payment they can put toward heating bills. The minimum benefit was $64 and the maximum was $1,148, with higher allowances up to $1,500 during a winter crisis. 
In fiscal year 2024, 28,234 Rhode Island households got help from the LIHEAP program. 
Tanzi said she’s worried about the program in 2026 due to changes in federal policy. A shutdown-induced delay concluded Friday when $3.6 billion in LIHEAP funding nationally was finally released to states. If LIHEAP suffers any cuts, Tanzi said, “we’re really in a crisis for people.” She pointed to lower-income survey respondents who answered the question, “Do you worry about winter energy costs?” 
Such respondents might be “basing their assumptions and their response to this on the availability of LIHEAP money,” Tanzi said. “If we did this poll again in two months, or three months, I have a feeling that things would be incredibly different in the responses.”

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)After months of hearings and study, the legislature’s Joint Commission on the Future of Cannabis Sales is poised to roll out a final proposal Tuesday that would launch a legal, regulated adult-use cannabis retail market in Virginia — potentially ending five years of economic and legal uncertainty since the commonwealth legalized possession and cultivation in 2021. 
The latest version — sponsored by Commission Chair Paul Krizek, D-Fairfax, in the House of Delegates and Sens. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, and Aaron Rouse, D-Virginia Beach, in the Senate — scraps the controversial local-opt-out clause, increases local taxing authority and builds a licensing regime designed to privilege small, independent, Virginia-based businesses over large medical-marijuana operators.
Krizek said the refinements are not about maximizing short-term revenue, but creating a sustainable, decentralized market that channels tax dollars back into communities disproportionately harmed by the War on Drugs — even if that means giving up some early windfalls.
“The goal has been to make sure it is a decentralized market structure, competitive, sustainable, prioritizing independent Virginia-based businesses,” Krizek told The Mercury in an interview last week. 
 Retail plan moves forward after years of vetoes

Virginia became the first Southern state to legalize adult-use cannabis in 2021, allowing adults 21 and older to possess up to 1 ounce and cultivate up to four plants at home. But the law included no mechanism for legal sales, and successive retail-market bills were blocked by vetoes from outgoing Gov. Glenn Youngkin.
The commission created earlier this year aims to deliver what lawmakers couldn’t: a comprehensive retail structure. Its final proposal is set to be formally introduced ahead of the 2026 session, with sales targeted to begin Nov. 1, 2026 — provided lawmakers clear the bill and Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger signs it.
Supporters say the absence of a legal retail framework has only bolstered the illicit market. “It was a bad day for organized crime in the illicit cannabis market,” Krizek said earlier this month, referring to the election of Spanberger, who has pledged to sign adult-use legislation.
Spanberger, a Democrat, told The Mercury in August that she supports “a legalized retail market for cannabis.” 
 What’s new: Opt-outs gone; local control expanded

The biggest change to the retail framework: a provision that would have allowed localities to opt out of cannabis sales altogether has been eliminated. 
Under earlier drafts, counties and cities could have banned retail outlets via referendum — a feature critics likened to “dry counties,” which risked stranding large populations without access to legal cannabis.
“We’re not going to have an opt-out for a lot of reasons,” Krizek said. 
He argued that opt-outs would invite unregulated illicit markets to flourish in “dry” zones, threaten public safety and undermine statewide equity and revenue goals. He added that local governments would retain full control over zoning, buffer zones and licensing requirements under the new plan.
The final bill also increases local taxing authority. Under previous proposals, localities could levy up to 2.5% in local excise tax. The new draft raises that cap to 3.5%, giving local governments more resources for schools, public-health campaigns and other priorities. 
The state tax remains at a proposed 8% — with a new provision to allow deductibility of certain business costs at the state level, even though marijuana remains federally illegal. 
The bill would also remove the sales tax on paraphernalia and treat those items under ordinary sales tax rules.
“With the local tax bump, communities will have a little bit more resources to do the things they need to do at the local level,” Krizek said.
Perhaps most consequential is a licensing regime aimed at decentralizing ownership and expanding opportunity for “micro-business” operators. 
Del. Paul Krizek, D-Fairfax (Courtesy of Krizek campaign)
As many as 50% of initial licenses would be reserved for micro-businesses — small operators who grow, process or sell cannabis on a modest scale. Large medical-marijuana operators will still be eligible, but all license holders will be capped at five total retail and/or grow/processing authorizations. 
Krizek said even a silent partner with a small stake — say 1% — would count toward that limit, making corporate consolidation difficult.
A new direct-to-consumer license also would allow micro-businesses to deliver cannabis directly to patient or adult-use customers’ homes — subject to regulation by the Virginia Cannabis Control Authority (CCA).
Krizek said the overall goal is to build “hundreds of new, small local businesses,” strengthen Virginia’s agricultural sector and direct tax dollars to the communities harmed most by prohibition. 
“We all recognize that we need to regulate, control and tax marijuana, so that we have a revenue that can help the community reinvest… and the racially disparate impacts of the prohibition or the War on Drugs.”
He emphasized the aim is a “well regulated adult market” that remains competitive and sustainable, even if the state takes in less tax revenue early on, rather than let a handful of large companies corner the industry.
 Commission draws on recent data and industry hearings

The final proposal, which will be posted to Virginia’s legislative information system in the coming days, reflects insights gathered at a series of public hearings held by the commission this year. 
In August, lawmakers heard from experts on taxation, equity and small-business opportunity — clear signals that the commission was preparing to write a framework that diverged from past drafts.
Players in the medical-cannabis system — which underlies the retail rollout — recently logged major milestones. The CCA’s seed-to-sale tracking system, operated through the vendor Metrc, is now live. Between July and August, the medical market recorded nearly $30 million in sales across more than 256,000 transactions. 
Proponents say that tracking, combined with planned labeling rules, testing standards, and delivery-license oversight, marks one of the strongest regulatory regimes in the country — and a much firmer barrier between the legal and illicit markets than existed under previous, vetoed plans. 
Critics at past hearings pointed out that older drafts still lacked crucial definitions for delivery agents and clarity on labeling, especially for edibles and topicals.
 Labor advocates welcome promise of “people-based market”

UFCW 400 — a union representing 35,000 workers across retail, cannabis, grocery, health care, food-processing and service jobs in the mid-Atlantic — praised the new plan’s emphasis on small businesses and equitable labor practices.
“We at UFCW 400 are excited to finally see a pathway for an adult use marketplace here in Virginia. We are pushing for a people-based market, one that centers workers, consumers, and community,” Kayla Mock, the union’s vice president, said in an email. 
The union hopes the legislation will include labor-peace provisions to ensure any worker organizing efforts are free from retaliation. Mock added that monopolies in the cannabis sector are bad for workers, consumers and long-term fairness, and supported the micro-license approach as a check against corporate dominance.
Union leaders say that, in states lacking labor protections, cannabis workers have faced “retaliation, intimidation and termination” when they attempted to unionize — conditions they hope Virginia’s new law will avoid.
 What’s next — and what could derail the rollout

The commission is scheduled to formally present the finalized proposal at Tuesday’s meeting, clearing the way for lawmakers to introduce the bill in the 2026 session. If all goes well — and there are no new roadblocks — retail sales could potentially begin Nov. 1, 2026.
But the outcome is not yet certain. Opponents may raise familiar concerns about public health, youth access and law enforcement challenges. Some have noted that the transition from decriminalization to a fully regulated retail market carries risks — especially if regulators do not balance access, safety and equity correctly.
Still, advocates say the revamped legislation could deliver on long-promised reforms. “We’ve got to stand up this legal marketplace sooner rather than later,” Krizek said.
If the bill passes next year, Virginia could finally close the book on five years of legal limbo — and become a test case for a Southern state embracing adult-use cannabis with an eye toward equity, community reinvestment and small-business growth.

(Photo by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)The Shenandoah salamander, northern long-eared bat and the rusty patch bumble bee are among the many animals on the federal endangered species list that live in Virginia and could be impacted by  proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act by the Trump administration.
Last week, the Department of Interior announced plans to roll back portions of the protections for plants and animals. The proposal calls for economic factors to be taken into account when determining adding species and habitats to the protective lists; previously it was a decision based solely on science.
In Virginia there are over 50 federally protected fauna species, and dozens more that are state protected.
“These proposals … will have the effect of likely meaning fewer species are listed, fewer species are getting the protections they need in their listing rules, and fewer critical habitat areas will be designated,” said Ramona McGee, the wildlife program leader for the Southern Environmental Law Center, which has two offices in Virginia, in Charlottesville and Richmond. “That all undermines the goal and purposes of the Endangered Species Act to conserve and recover threatened endangered species.”
Currently, species that are federally listed as “threatened” get the same protections as the species that have officially been deemed “endangered.” This means they cannot be killed or harmed unless species-specific alternatives are approved by the federal government. The proposal would remove those protections for threatened species.
“This administration is restoring the Endangered Species Act to its original intent, protecting species through clear, consistent and lawful standards that also respect the livelihoods of Americans who depend on our land and resources,” said Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. “These revisions end years of legal confusion and regulatory overreach, delivering certainty to states, tribes, landowners and businesses while ensuring conservation efforts remain grounded in sound science and common sense.”
Additionally, the proposal looks to narrow what can be considered critical habitat and would make it easier for development projects such as drilling, mining and logging to be approved.
“Someone who is wanting to build a data center or to build a pipeline will not have to consider as wide a range of impacts or effects from that action as they might otherwise have to under the existing regulations,” McGee said. 
The proposed rule changes “would significantly narrow the scope of the effects that could be considered during that consultation process, and by extension, that means it will constrain the sort of conservation measures that could be put in place,” McGee added.
Environmental groups and endangered species advocates say rolling back these rules will lead to more extinctions and make it harder to bring some species back from the brink.
“These regulations attempt to undermine implementation of one of America’s bedrock environmental laws, and they could seal the fate of animals that, without these protections, would disappear from the Earth,” said Sierra Club Executive Director Loren Blackford in a statement.
An open public comment period is underway for the proposed change, allowing people to share their opinions on the proposal. After the public comment period ends on Dec. 21, it will be up to the agency to finalize the rule.

None shines brighter than its system of public colleges and universities.
Why, then, have the executive branches of the state and federal government gone after these prestigious institutions of higher learning in an ideological purge with all the grace and discernment of thugs in a dark alleyway?
I get it:  Conservatives have long chafed at the perceptions elite universities and their faculty lean left and that it influences their alumni who ascend to powerful roles in government, finance, law and media. To conservatives’ credit, they’re not always wrong.
We’ve seen thinkers and influencers on the right hounded, threatened and worse by students on the left. Scheduled appearances have been canceled altogether and conservative voices shouted down on college campuses — the last place where free, peaceful expression, thought and inquiry should be stifled.
Two years ago, an online petition by George Mason University students sought to disinvite Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, from addressing the spring 2023 commencement at the invitation of the university’s president, Gregory Washington.
GMU’s president is right to reject students’ call to cancel Youngkin’s commencement speech

Washington stood his ground and welcomed the conservative governor to campus. Three years before that, during nationwide protests over the curbside police murder of George Floyd, Washington — who is Black — thwarted attempts to destroy a statue to GMU’s white, slaveholding namesake at the state’s largest and most diverse state-supported university.
Yet it is Washington, because of his work to diversify GMU’s faculty and student body, who is the target of a committed effort by the Trump White House (you’d imagine it has more pressing business) to oust him unless he publicly apologizes for his diversity work. Again, Washington is standing his ground.
It heightens the irony that Washington is among three Virginia college presidents targeted for ouster by conservatives over what they decry as “woke” diversity, equity and inclusion programs. 
They began after Youngkin’s conservative appointees took charge of the governing boards of those universities: GMU, the University of Virginia and Virginia Military Institute. They became amplified, with an urgent stridency, after Donald Trump took office in January and tasked his departments of Education and Justice to root out DEI at universities nationwide with a focus on Ivy League schools.
At VMI, that school’s first African American superintendent (analogous to a president elsewhere) was forced out in late February when a Youngkin-appointed majority on VMI’s board voted not to renew his contract beyond its June expiration. Retired Army Maj. Gen. Cedric Wins, a VMI alumnus, was appointed superintendent in late 2020 under Democratic former Gov. Ralph Northam to advance DEI at VMI after an independent report uncovered widespread sexism and racism, including “racial slurs and jokes” on campus.
While the board stated no reason for its vote, House of Delegates Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, called it “purely political.” A spokesman for Youngkin said board members did “what they believe to be in the best interest of this prestigious military college” but offered no reason for the action.
The second head to roll came in June when UVA’s president, Jim Ryan, resigned with the state’s flagship university facing threats of punitive litigation by the Trump Justice Department and tens of millions of dollars in fines plus millions more in lost federal research grants over the university’s DEI standards in hiring and admissions.
The DoJ, under its novel interpretation of the 60-year-old Civil Rights Act that was passed to end discrimination against Black people in the Jim Crow South, alleged UVA had violated the statute by disadvantaging white applicants. That was the hammer that forced Ryan out in early summer, but the pressure had begun in March after Youngkin’s administration began urging the university to dismantle its DEI program. 
A tone-deaf attack on diversity at a university first built by the enslaved

The Justice Department paused its investigation after Ryan’s resignation and reached a settlement with UVA in October. Then came this month’s thundering Blue Wave election that portends to change everything. Republicans were swept out of every statewide executive office as Democrats won almost two-thirds of the 100-seat House of Delegates.
Democratic Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger fired the first salvo in a remarkable flurry of jaw-dropping letters related to Virginia’s university boards. She penned a Nov. 12 open letter to the Youngkin-dominated UVA Board of Visitors urging it to suspend an ongoing search for Ryan’s successor. The unspoken subtext is that effective at noon on Jan. 17, she can sack the whole board by happy hour and put her own slate of members before a Democratic House and Senate for fast confirmation.
On Nov. 13, Youngkin responded with his own missive, rebuking Spanberger — a UVA alumna — for “efforts to bully or micromanage” the university board, urging the current presidential search process to continue apace and reminding his successor that he runs the state until inauguration day. Youngkin also insisted that “it’s clear that neither (the) DoJ nor the current Board leadership made Jim (Ryan) resign.”
On the 14th, Ryan issued his own 12-page epistle disputing Youngkin’s defense of the Justice Department and the Board. In it, Ryan disclosed Justice Department lawyers’ alleged threats “bleed UVA white” and “basically rain hell on UVA” unless Ryan complied with their resignation demand just hours ahead of their 5 p.m. deadline on June 26. He met the deadline and, for 141 days, heeded the warning to remain mute.  
Ryan wrote that some wondered why he didn’t just go public about the DoJ pressure campaign, and he said he considered it. 
“But the call for my resignation, right until the end, seemed so outlandish as not to be entirely believable. It also felt like a hostage situation, where the kidnapper threatens harm if you do not keep information about the demands confidential,” the former UVA leader wrote.
Washington is still GMU’s president. His cause — and, by extension, Spanberger’s — seemed boosted recently when the Virginia Supreme Court refused to hear the Youngkin administration’s appeal of a lower court ruling that Youngkin appointees to the GMU, UVA and VMI boards could not serve because they lacked Senate confirmation.
So here we sit, in a state long hailed for the quality of its colleges and universities, consumed in enough contrived drama to keep reality-TV addicts glued to Bravo for months on end.
According to a new report by the Senate Finance and Appropriations Committee, Virginia’s 15 public universities are part of a system ranked first nationally in 2025 by CNBC. Three Virginia universities are among the top 100 nationally in the most recent annual U.S. News & World Report rankings, including UVA as America’s No. 4 public university.
Trump’s ‘excellence’ compact kills UVA’s free speech and self-rule

This was an unnecessary fight, brought on by unprecedented Executive Branch overreach from both the White House and Youngkin. It weakens our public institutions of higher learning and feeds growing cynicism that they are pawns of boards doing the partisan bidding of whomever is in power, without regard for the unique needs and missions of each.
The tragedy is that the seeming remedy — wholesale replacements and reversals pending from a new governor and party in charge in Richmond that appears eager to battle Trump in court — will appear to many to be just as nakedly political.
Thus the pendulum swings, wider and faster.  
Like so much spoiled by today’s necrotic politics, there’s no clear path from the present chaos and enmity back to norms of sanity, civility and reason in the governance of these exemplary institutions. We’re all the poorer for it.

State senators may call UVA leaders to the carpet over agreement to end DOJ investigations

In April, the U.S. Department of Justice launched an investigation into UVA over claims that the institution violated federal civil rights laws in its admissions, hiring, diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, and that its campus culture was inhospitable to Jewish students. UVA refuted the allegations, but signed an agreement with the DoJ last month to put the inquiries on ice.
UVA, Department of Justice agree to pause civil rights investigations

UVA did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday’s meeting with lawmakers. 
Interim President Paul Mahoney is scheduled to attend the gathering, according to the agenda, along with Rachel Sheridan and Porter Wilkinson, the rector and vice rector for the UVA Board of Visitors, to provide an update on institutional leadership and finances. 
Del. Katrina Callsen, D-Albemarle, who does not sit on the Senate Finance & Appropriations subcommittee for higher education, has been critical of UVA’s decisions and its agreement with the DoJ. She, along with Sen. Creigh Deeds, D-Charlottesville, called for leaders to reverse the action.
“I want transparency for both the public and the legislature,” Callsen said in a statement to the Mercury last week. “I trust that my Senate colleagues will pursue information that will help everyone better understand the interactions that occurred between UVA and the federal government and the full nature of the settlement agreement UVA formed with the DOJ. Virginians deserve to know what is happening in Virginia universities.”
Lawmakers have expressed disappointment over the matter and urged the institution to reconsider its decision, but have never imposed any consequences. They only reminded UVA officials of its responsibilities concerning legal liability, state sovereignty and conflict with existing law. They have also said state funding to the school could be impacted.
However, UVA leaders have stood by the decision to sign the agreement, unlike other institutions that have gone to court, risking losing federal funds. Gov. Glenn Youngkin called the agreement a “fair deal” in support.
Senators will also hear from Virginia Military Institute Superintendent Lt. General David Furness — who replaced former Ret. Major Gen. Cedric Wins, the first Black superintendent who was ousted by the governing board — and updates from the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia and the Council of Presidents.
The meeting is scheduled for 10 a.m.

(Photo by Lauren McCauley/ Maine Morning Star)Many Maine households and businesses have felt squeezed by electricity costs in recent years. With prices set to increase even more, lawmakers are trying to do what they can to lower consumers’ bills.
Lawmakers passed a law last legislative session that is meant to lower the cost of net energy billing, a renewable energy credit program that receives a lot of blame for rising costs, though officials point to the volatility of fossil fuels as the real driver of the increases. 
But the work to lower Mainers’ energy expenses isn’t over yet and lawmakers are contemplating ways that tax credits could help with that.
Just last week, the Public Utilities Commission announced new electricity prices for 2026. Both Central Maine Power and Versant customers can expect to see their bills increase by an average of $13 to $17, according to an analysis by the Office of Public Advocate. 
But even before that increase was announced, legislative leaders decided to consider at least two bills when lawmakers reconvene in January that propose using tax credits to offset energy costs. 
One proposal was initially introduced last session but didn’t have a public hearing before the Energy, Utilities and Technology Committee until the end of October. Bill sponsor Rep. Steven Foster (R-Dexter) said LD 1223 would shift the cost of assistance programs from ratepayer to taxpayers.
The bill proposes a refundable income tax credit for ratepayers of 6% of the total amount paid for electricity services in the previous calendar year. That amount would represent how much each household is paying for various assistance programs, including net energy billing, the low-income assistance program, and the arrearage management program, which helps low-income customers who are behind on their bills. 
For example, if a household paid $120 towards those programs over the course of the year, they would file for an income tax credit for that amount, which would then be paid from the state’s general fund. 
The thinking is that more people, including tourists and part-time residents, pay into the general fund and their contribution would help allay the burden currently placed solely on energy customers.
Foster also argued that having ratepayers shoulder the cost of these social programs operates like a regressive tax, in which low income consumers pay a greater proportion of their income, whereas shifting those costs to the general fund utilizes Maine’s existing progressive tax structure. 
During the hearing for LD 1223, there was mention of a similar bill from Rep. Kilton Webb (D-Durham) that will go before the Taxation Committee next year. Webb’s bill is still being drafted, but he said it will propose a $50 a month tax credit for qualifying low-income ratepayers. 
“This comes from the most important word of our times which is ‘affordability,’” Webb said. 
As a member of the energy committee, Webb said he wanted to find innovative ways to alleviate costs for ratepayers. 
“If a freshman Democrat legislator and a ranking member on the Republican side are kinda coming to the same conclusion, I think this is an idea with some real legs,” Webb said, referring to his and Foster’s bills. 
Foster’s bill is more nuanced, which Webb said speaks to the more senior lawmaker’s creativity and experience. However, both lawmakers said they are open to bipartisan work on these proposals to help turn them into policy that could benefit ratepayers.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/CMPbill-2048x1536-3-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-12-01 05:56:42.597460

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The Thanksgiving holiday is known to include tables full of food, but with Ohioans still feeling the effects of federal cuts to SNAP and food banks still bending under the weight of demand, for some the table won’t be quite as full.
The federal government’s shutdown and the hold-up it caused for existing SNAP benefits didn’t help matters. The Ohio Association of Foodbanks served 46% more people at state food pantries from Nov. 1 to Nov. 21 than it had on average in each of the previous months this year.
“This situation underscored the critical importance of SNAP as the first line of defense against hunger for many families, seniors, and disabled Ohioans that would regularly face food budget shortfalls without support from SNAP,” Joree Novotny, executive director of the association, told the Capital Journal.
Even prior to the shutdown, the association was already seeing increases in the first quarter of this year, and had concerns about how they would sustain the help amid growing demand.
“While the impact of the shutdown shined a light on the issue, food insecurity was far too prevalent before the shutdown and remains far too prevalent in its aftermath,” Novotny said.
From July to September of this year, the network saw a 6.7% increase in food provided compared to the same period in 2024, a 14% increase from 2023, and a nearly 41% increase from 2022. This included take-home groceries, hot meals and meals provided at community sites.
Food banks had to accommodate reductions in federal contributions from the USDA, which Novotny said they did by sourcing more than 28 million pounds of donated food, and spending monetary donations on 16.2 million pounds on food. That sourcing made up 70% of all the food provided through the network.
“Normally, federal and state (contributions) represent about half of all of the food our network distributes,” Novotny said. “This level of private purchasing cannot be sustained, particularly by food banks serving areas of the state facing philanthropy gaps and wider disparity in resources.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXFood pantries weren’t the only ones attempting to make up for the SNAP shortfalls. The Children’s Hunger Alliance worked to battle child hunger impacts from the SNAP situation, despite seeing drops in state funding. The alliance’s state contribution went from the governor’s proposal that would have provided $3.75 million in each of the next two years, down to $3 million in fiscal year 2026 and $2.5 million in 2027 as approved in the final budget.
While the alliance was able to “hold the line” with regard to federal and state support in combination with private donations, changes in childhood food insecurity take a year or more to understand, according to the organization’s president, Michelle M. Brown.
“The SNAP disruption during the government shutdown may continue to affect low-income families in the weeks and months ahead, because many were forced to make difficult budget choices in November,” Brown said.
The leader said there are still “looming threats to federal food programs” that could send families right back into the dilemma of making hard decisions between paying bills and putting food on the table.
In 2024, the Children’s Hunger Alliance served 10.8 million meals to more than 161,000 children in 76 Ohio counties, according to alliance data.
More than 517,000 children experienced food insecurity in Ohio in 2023, according to the most recent data from Feeding America. Of those, 72% met the income eligibility for federal food assistance programs like SNAP.
“Childhood hunger is a solvable issue – it just requires public and private leadership, financial resources, and communities united behind the belief that every child deserves the chance to thrive and reach their full potential,” Brown said.
The alliance built a partnership with public and private donors to launch the “Thanksgiving Meals initiative,” providing food and a gift cards to 1,900 households in central Ohio this year. The organization also extended their Weekend Meals program during the Thanksgiving and Christmas weeks “to ensure children across Ohio have access to nutritious meals when school’s out.”

For millions of shoppers, buy-now-pay-later options like Klarna, Afterpay and Affirm have become the preferred way to pay. These companies promise to make the shopping experience easier by letting you split your payments, avoid interest, and keep track of your purchases all in one place. Today you can use them to pay for everything from flights to shoes to Chipotle burritos. 
Sounds empowering, right?
Except it’s not. Behind their friendly designed platforms is a system that targets consumers, hurts credit scores, and encourages impulsive spending. 
There is no question that buy-now-pay-later services make shopping feel easier. You can buy what you want right away, even if you don’t have the cash up front. You can shop online or in-store and quickly check out with your item without needing a credit card. And if you’re unsure about an item, you can order it, try it at home, and return it if it does not fit right, all without actually having to pay. Buy-now-pay-later companies make owing debt to shop sound convenient and harmless — and that is exactly what makes them so risky. Creating an account with them basically only requires an address, a phone number, proof that you’re over 18 and a payment method. 
In reality, these companies mislead the very people they attract. Their “pay over time” plan lets shoppers split a purchase into smaller monthly payments. It sounds great, but the APR (the extra cost you pay for borrowing) can range from 0% to 36% depending on consumers’ credit score. A 2024 study from the Federal Reserve showed that buy-now-pay-later users tend to already have low credit scores, meaning that they are least likely to qualify for 0% payment plans. What looks like an easier way to pay ends up being more costly for target shoppers. 










 Behind their friendly designed platforms is a system that targets consumers, hurts credit scores, and encourages impulsive spending. 


Their other paying options are not as harmless as they seem. Their “Pay in 4 monthly installments” option might be interest-free, but they can collect late fees. As a user, frequent purchases made through these apps are easy to lose track of. In a 2025 survey from LendingTree, 41% of buy-now-pay-later users reported that they missed at least one payment in the past year. Klarna, Afterpay and Affirm all report missed or late payments to credit agencies. In the United States, where big purchases like homes and cars rely on a credit score, missing payments can negatively affect your creditworthiness — and your future plans. 
We should be more worried about the psychology behind these apps. On its website, Klarna proudly states that businesses using their service specifically see a 40% increase in order value and a 46% higher purchase frequency than the average consumer. In other words, Klarna openly admits that their success depends on getting people to spend more through its well-developed checkout process. The overspending that these companies promote does not only harm our wallets, it also harms our planet. Klarna’s partner network consists of 790,000 brands, Afterpay’s has 348,000 and Affirm’s has 375,000. These include fast fashion retailers like River Island, Boohoo, Asos, Missguided and Pretty Little Thing, who all produce cheap clothing that end up in landfills. For context, the fast fashion industry makes up 10% of global emissions. With the help of these apps, that rate can increase.
In September this year, Klarna raised approximately $1.37 billion through its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange, which made it one of the largest IPOs of 2025. The Swedish company recently reported $903 million in third quarter revenue, over three times the number from two years ago. This growth comes at the expense of consumers. Millions of people use buy-now-pay-later services without fully understanding their risks. What looks like convenience can leave your friends, family or even you into debt, with lower creditworthiness and future financial stress. These companies profit from consumers’ lack of understanding — that needs to change. 
The government must enforce clearer cost disclosures, greater transparency about interest rates and stricter sign-up policies that include credit education. As consumers, we must also do our part by thinking twice next time we shop now and pay later.

(Photo by Stephen Maturen/Getty Images)Northeast of the capital city of Des Moines in central Iowa, the 400-student Collins-Maxwell Community School District is one of many across the state shifting to a four-day school week.
Like many rural K-12 schools, the district has struggled to find teachers, and it sees the four-day week as a useful recruiting tool. It also wants to curb student absences, which tend to spike on Mondays and Fridays.
The district maintained its traditional five-day calendar in August and September. But from now on, with scattered exceptions, the middle school and high school in the Collins-Maxwell district will be closed on Mondays. To meet Iowa’s minimum number of instructional hours, the district will lengthen the other days during four-day weeks.
Superintendent Marc Snavely said he watched nearby schools transition to shorter weeks and was intrigued by the reports he got from his counterparts in other districts. Snavely hopes the shorter week will boost teacher morale, reduce burnout, and make the rural district more competitive with nearby districts that are larger and can offer teachers better pay.
“Ultimately, the ‘why’ behind the four-day school week came down to staff recruitment and retention,” Snavely said in an interview. “We felt being a small school district, the four-day week would allow us to better compete.”
He added that surrounding schools with four-day weeks said they experienced fewer discipline problems and improved attendance. And rural school districts across the country tout the four-day work week as a way to stretch tight school budgets amid K-12 funding uncertainties at the federal and state levels.
But despite the reports of higher attendance and calmer classrooms, education researchers say the evidence tells a more complicated story.










Ultimately, the ‘why’ behind the four-day school week came down to staff recruitment and retention.


– Collins-Maxwell Community School District Superintendent Marc Snavely


Emily Morton, lead researcher for the Northwest Evaluation Association, which creates standardized testing for K-12 schools, cautioned that the promised benefits have not shown up in the data. Moreover, longer school days can harm academic performance, Morton said.
But such concerns might not matter as four-day school weeks become more popular nationwide.
“One thing that does show up clearly is that there is an extremely high approval rating for these policies,” Morton said. “Parents and students overwhelmingly want to stay on a four-day week once they have it.”
A rural trend
There are more than 2,100 schools in 26 states using four-day weeks, according to researchers at Oregon State University. In Iowa, the number of districts on a four-day schedule has grown from six in 2023-24 to more than two dozen in 2025. In Colorado, two-thirds of districts are on the altered schedule.
But so far, it’s almost entirely a rural phenomenon.
“To my knowledge, there’s not a single urban district using a four-day week,” Morton said. “What a four-day week looks like in a rural community is very different from what people in suburban or urban areas imagine.”
4-day school weeks, gaining in popularity, face pushback from lawmakers

Dr. Shanon Taylor, an education professor at the University of Nevada, Reno who studies school scheduling, said districts typically adopt the model for economic and staffing reasons, not academic ones. Rural districts often save money on transportation, utilities and building operations, she said, and the promise of permanent three-day weekends helps recruitment efforts.
However, the burden of accommodating this transition may fall heavily on parents who work five days a week, and especially on the parents of younger students who must find a child care alternative on the selected day off.
“The research is still mixed,” Taylor said. “We don’t yet have decisive evidence showing academic benefits or drawbacks.”
In June, researchers at the University of Oregon published a review of 11 studies on four-day school weeks, which included data on academic achievement, attendance, discipline and criminal activity. The impact of a four-day week varied based on grade level on location, the Oregon researchers found, but overall “there was no evidence of large positive effects.”
They also noted that “maintaining activities that foster healthy youth development on the fifth day is important for minimizing other negative impacts.”
State vs. local clashes
In some states, the policy has sparked conflict between state and local officials.
“There’s a lot of tension between state leaders and rural districts over whether the four-day week is something the state should allow,” said Morton. “In Oklahoma, when the state tried to take it away, districts simply shifted to ‘virtual Fridays’ — and instruction mostly didn’t happen.”
Why More School Districts Are Holding Class Just Four Days a Week

The Oklahoma Council of Public Affairs, a conservative think tank, found through a public records request that more than 100 Oklahoma districts had at least one school where students had at least two full weeks’ worth of “virtual days” in the 2022-23 school year. More than 60 districts had at least one school that went online for three weeks or more. During many of those days, there was minimal live instruction.
In response, Oklahoma this year enacted a law that restricts public schools’ ability to shift to virtual learning. The measure limits districts to two days of virtual instruction each school year, and only allows them under certain circumstances, such as a state of emergency declared by the governor.
Missouri enacted a law in 2024 requiring that certain big city, charter and county districts obtain voter approval before adopting or continuing a four-day week. The Independence School District, a 14,000-student suburban system on the edge of Kansas City that switched to the shorter week in 2023-24, has since sued the state, alleging the law unconstitutionally targets certain districts based on arbitrary criteria such as county size.
Last year, a New Mexico mandate for districts to adopt calendars with more school days was halted in court. And Arkansas legislators considered a bill that would allow for range of instructional times from 160 to 190 days, which would be contingent on a school’s rating. A large number of rural districts there have moved to four-day schedules.
Meanwhile, uncertainty over the costs and benefits of the approach are likely to persist.
Morton, the education assessment researcher, said that small rural districts might not be equipped to determine whether a four-day week produces benefits until further studies are conducted across the country.
“Even if your test scores stay flat, nearby districts might be rising, so your ‘flat’ could actually be a negative effect,” she said. “States need to equip districts with what national research shows, because local data will never be able to answer these questions alone.”

The proposal: to connect their water systems with the city of Manchester to allow more than 1 million gallons of water to flow to the towns per day. 
The project, which involved Atkinson, Derry, Hampstead, Plaistow Salem, and Windham, was designed to address an acute problem: the contamination of wells in those towns by methyl-tert-butyl ether, an ingredient of gasoline that had seeped into the groundwater due to leaky storage. A 2003 lawsuit brought by the state against 22 gasoline manufacturers had secured settlement funds that helped pay for the $20 million water infrastructure project.  
But some now point to that collaboration — the largest of its kind in the state — as a template to address a thorny problem. As lawmakers and state officials seek to encourage housing construction to address deep shortages, some are pointing to a less discussed problem: access to water and sewer capacity. 
In October, St. Anselm College unveiled an update to the New Hampshire Zoning Atlas — the interactive tool first launched in 2023 to compare towns’ zoning restrictions. The latest version of the tool depicts which areas of cities and towns have access to water lines, sewer lines, or both. 
And the researchers behind the atlas uncovered a revealing statistic: Just 12% of the state’s buildable land has access to either water or sewer services, and just 5.6% has access to both. 
That poses a major limitation for developers. “When we talk about density, we’re talking about how many units can you put on an acre,” said Preston Hunter, vice president of business development at PROCON, a Hooksett construction management firm, speaking at a presentation of the Atlas in October. “And there’s really two major determining factors there. One is zoning, and the other is the availability of sewer and water.” 
In the southern part of the state, water can be particularly fraught. “A big issue we see is access to water,” Deshaies said. “There’s just not always enough groundwater to sustain more dense or larger developments that are being proposed.” 
But each town has its own unique problems. 
Housing policy experts point to some solutions. Alternative septic technology such as aerobic treatment systems, which use bacteria to break down waste in places with poor soil conditions, could allow property owners to develop housing in hard-to-reach areas, noted Elissa Margolis, director of the St. Anselm Initiative for Housing Policy and Practice. And community septic systems could allow more creative approaches at scale, she added.
But the biggest barrier often lies with the capacity of the existing infrastructure in a city or town. And just having access to water and sewer does not fix all problems, said Margaret Brynes, executive director of the New Hampshire Municipal Association. 
“Even when you look at land that can be developed that is on public water and sewer, you have to keep in mind capacity,” Byrnes said in an interview. “It’s not unlimited just because you have a public system.” 
One significant problem for municipalities is the age of their infrastructure. Simply maintaining it can be costly, let alone upgrades, said Brodie Deshaies, a legislative advocate at the Municipal Association. Many cities and towns are facing the need to improve the flow rate of their existing facilities before additional capacity is realistic. 
“We have members that struggle to be able to afford the upkeep with the continued downward pressure that’s caused by inflation, increased cost of living, and property taxes that fund the majority of services and infrastructure in the state,” Deshaies said.
Deterioration may force some towns to replace their pipes. But if they want to meaningfully expand their services, they might need to widen the pipes, an even more expensive prospect, said Deshaies. 
Meanwhile, water access poses its own conundrum: Cities and towns that draw on bodies of water for their water source are limited in how much they can draw by the state Department of Environmental Services. They also face limits on where and how much wastewater they can expel. 
Any solution is likely to require residents of a town to approve a large municipal bond to pay for it via a supermajority vote, at a time when property taxes are already high. 
Researchers behind the St. Anselm atlas hope that it will provide developers, municipalities, state officials, and lawmakers with a clearer understanding of where housing is possible — and where more needs to be done.
“It can help us understand more globally what types of investments might be needed and might be supported, especially for communities that clearly want more housing, but they’re constrained by the lack of infrastructure,” said Heather Shank, director of the Division of Planning and Community Development at the state Department of Business and Economic Affairs. 
The update to the atlas comes as legislators have passed a number of laws to prevent municipalities from imposing restrictions on housing in the last year. Housing advocates have said the laws are meant to eliminate road blocks to necessary development amid the state’s housing shortage.
But if more is not done to help cities and towns expand their water and sewer capacity, the Municipal Association argues, local governments will be forced to make hard decisions. 
“What will end up happening, in some cases, is they will either place a moratorium on building to update their zoning … to try to address (that) overburdening of infrastructure, or they will have to stop hooking up people to water and sewer,” Deshaies said. 
Lawmakers are introducing some bills for the 2026 session aimed at expanding water and sewer access. Rep. Joe Sweeney, a Salem Republican, is bringing forward legislation to enable “special assessment districts” that could allow municipalities to pay for infrastructure improvements through special tax arrangements on developers. Rep. Chris Muns, a Hampton Democrat, has introduced a bill to levy a statewide tax on second homes to pay for housing funding. And Rep. Daniel Veilleux, an Amherst Democrat, is sponsoring legislation “encouraging municipalities with sewage systems to extend system service to neighboring communities.”
The NHMA opposed many of the zoning overhaul laws signed by Ayotte this year, arguing that municipalities should be allowed to move forward on housing intentionally. That should be ideally be done by creating a master plan for new developments and orienting any needed infrastructure upgrades to that plan, Deshaies says.
But on the question of water and sewer, housing advocates and municipalities appear to agree. 
“It might seem as if we got rid of all this ‘red tape’ and that’s going to incentivize building,” said Deshaies. “Without the infrastructure, these units still aren’t going to get built.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/sewer-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-01 05:56:42.597460

The Arkansas State Board of Education released both sets of proposed rules for public comment in November. The public meetings are scheduled for 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. Tuesday at the Arkansas Department of Education’s auditorium, which is located at 4 Capitol Mall.
The Educational Freedom Account program, which was created through the LEARNS Act in 2023, allows state funds to be used for allowable education expenses, such as private school tuition, extracurricular activities and technological devices. The program was phased in over three years with increasing eligibility. It opened to all students for the first time this fall. 
Arkansas education board releases revised school voucher program rules for public comment

EFA students receive up to 90% of the annual per-student public school funding rate. For the 2025-2026 school year, EFA participants may each be allotted up to $6,864 in state funding. 
Revisions to the EFA program rules include defining universal eligibility, establishing a fixed application window, revising payment schedules and administrative fees, and clarifying qualifying expenses. 
Changes to the rules incorporate provisions of Act 920 of 2025, which prohibits EFA participants from using more than 25% of their allocated funds for extracurricular activities, physical education activities or educational field trips within the state of Arkansas. 
Extracurricular activities don’t include “team sports or club sports,” according to the revised rules, which also explicitly exclude EFA funds from being used for equipment, recreational fees, travel costs and dues.
State education board members expressed concern at November’s meeting that the rules would prohibit students from using EFA funds for school-sponsored sports teams. Education department staff said they anticipated the rules would generate a lot of public comment, which led to the department scheduling two public meetings. 
At both meetings, Arkansans can also share their thoughts on rules for the Arkansas Adult Diploma program, which is for adults who don’t have a high school diploma, but are not seeking a GED. Changes to these rules include amending the definition of milestones and clarifying the payment associated with each milestone. 
The public comment period lasts 30 days, and if there are “substantive changes,” the rules will be revised and sent out again for another public comment period. Once the public comment process has concluded, a final draft of the rules will be presented to the education board for approval. The rules will then advance to the Arkansas Legislative Council for final approval. 
The current public comment period closes on Dec. 16. Those who cannot attend Tuesday’s meetings may submit comments to the education department by emailing ADE.RulesComments@ade.arkansas.gov.
Drafts of the pending rules and details about the public comment period are available on the education department’s website.

(Photo by Nick Evans, Ohio Capital Journal.)Ohio lawmakers introduced tweaks last month to a bill effectively prohibiting many immigrants from owning land in the state. Those changes include carveouts for green card holders and those who have served in the armed forces. But opponents don’t see the changes as much of an improvement.
The restrictions apply to people from countries designated as foreign adversaries. That list, compiled by the U.S. Secretary of Commerce, includes China, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Russia.
As part of Ohio’s 2023 state operating budget, Gov. DeWine allowed restrictions on foreign farmland ownership but refused to apply the same prohibitions to land within 25 miles of military installations. Ohio House Bill 1 revives those vetoed provisions and expands them to include critical infrastructure.
The sponsors’ stated concern is that allowing foreign governments, businesses, and agents to buy land nearby leaves the U.S. vulnerable to spying or sabotage.
“As legislators,” state Rep. Angie King, R-Celina, said when she introduced the bill, “we have a responsibility to protect Ohio from those who seek to undermine and destroy our American values and way of life.”
But critics, including civil rights groups and scores of immigrants from targeted countries, contend the bill is exceptionally harsh. The measure relies on a definition of critical infrastructure that includes large, discrete facilities like power plants, dams, and refineries, but it also extends to vast power and communication networks. For instance, every telephone and utility pole, the lines that run between them, and every cell tower fit squarely within that definition.
The changes
Barring ownership within 25 miles, as the original bill did, leaves little if any land in Ohio available. The amendment in the Ohio House reduced that limitation to 10 miles. But opponents say, with such an expansive list, even a one-mile ban “would render significant portions of Ohio inaccessible for families and businesses.”
In addition to reducing the radius of the bill’s exclusion zone, the amendment provides exemptions for legal permanent residents and people who have served or are serving in the military.
The changes also provide protection for property willed to someone, as well as property used to retire outstanding debts.
County prosecutors raised concerns early on about taking on potentially complex cases. “Without additional resources these cases will take time away from the core responsibilities of county prosecutors,” Ohio Prosecuting Attorneys Association Executive Director Lou Tobin said. The amendment includes a provision giving county prosecutors the ability to hand cases off to the state attorney general if they don’t have the resources to pursue them.
The bill grandfathers land already owned by individuals who would otherwise be prohibiting from ownership, but bars them from acquiring any other property. Should the measure take effect, anyone who becomes subject to the bill in the future would have to sell their property within two years.
In a joint statement, The Asian American Coalition of Ohio, Ohio Chinese American Association, and Justice for Ohio, acknowledged that narrowing the bill’s scope shows lawmakers are hearing them, but they insisted the changes don’t go nearly far enough.
The bill continues to discriminate against people in the U.S. lawfully, the groups said, based solely on their national origin — one of the seven protected characteristics laid out in the federal Fair Housing Act.
The bill also “conflicts directly with established U.S. and Ohio laws governing property ownership, due process and equal protection,” the groups added. Not only does the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution require equal protection, but Article 1 Section 1 of the Ohio Constitution includes “acquiring, possessing, and protecting property” among all individuals’ inalienable rights.
The groups noted as well that the prohibitions would discourage legitimate investment in the state.
“At a moment when Ohio is striving to attract advanced manufacturing, strengthen its workforce, and deepen international partnerships, H.B. 1 sends a damaging and counterproductive message,” they wrote.
As for the newly proposed 10-mile exclusion radius, the groups said, “no evidence has been presented that these sweeping geographic bans improve national security or public safety.”
After the amendment was introduced, state Rep. Juanita Brent, D-Cleveland, pressed supporters to provide a map of the state showing what property is and isn’t excluded. The chair, state Rep. Cindy Abrams, R-Harrison, made no promises, but said she’d ask the sponsors if they have one.
Just before the committee adopted the amendment, state Rep. Cecil Thomas, D-Cincinnati, objected.
“Obviously, it’s discriminatory, in my opinion, on its face,” he said of the bill.
“In my opinion, this particular bill will weaken Ohio’s economy and competitiveness, basically creating an environment that certain individuals or businesses from certain origins of the world are not welcome,” he said. “This bill would clearly create a potential for racial profiling and create a question of equal protection under the law.”

(Photo by Kate Brindley/New Hampshire Bulletin)We take voting seriously in New Hampshire, traditionally the first state to hold presidential elections every four years. A new report from the New Hampshire Campaign for Voting Rights should alarm anyone concerned about voting fraud or voters’ rights in our state or elsewhere in the United States.
In the first elections since Republican state legislators passed a strict new voter registration law, hundreds of voters were turned away on election days in New Hampshire in 2025. These appear to be eligible voters who just didn’t have the right identification with them. And the damage is only beginning. Married women, especially, may be blocked from voting in the mid-term elections in 2026 unless legislators rescind these unnecessarily strict regulations.
Before New Hampshire Republicans passed House Bill 1659, unregistered voters who showed up on election day could sign an affidavit saying they’re eligible to vote, and their ballot wouldn’t be counted until they provided citizenship evidence within two weeks.
Now, unregistered voters who show up on election day must bring a passport, birth certificate, or naturalization papers to prove citizenship. If they have ever changed their name — as have 8 in 10 women in opposite-sex marriages — they must bring a passport, birth certificate, or naturalization papers. But the birth certificates of married women may no longer match the name they use today. And in New Hampshire, approximately 45% of citizens do not have a passport.
If you forget to bring these documents or you can’t get them before the polls close, you can’t vote.
Why is this a problem? The New Hampshire Campaign for Voting Rights counted up the number of voters turned away under the new law in 2025, a year with only a smattering of local, low-turnout elections around the state. In all, 244 people who were trying to vote were denied, the New Hampshire Bulletin reported. Imagine how that number could skyrocket in a big election year like 2026, with state and federal elections ahead.
But how do we know if those 244 people were legitimate voters? Is the law actually working like it was supposed to, and just excluding fraudsters? Not likely. Consider this: The Heritage Foundation, an ultra-conservative organization, tracks the number of fraudulent voting convictions. In the last 10 years, from 2015 through 2024, they found only 22 cases in New Hampshire. The new voting law turned away more than 10 times that many in just one year.
Using the Heritage Foundation data, fraudulent votes average about two per year. The onerous law in New Hampshire turned away more than 100 times that many potential voters in a year. New Hampshire’s law boomeranged and is hitting legitimate voters in the face.
Republicans in the State House need to fix this, and fast. They’re not just blocking voters, they’re wasting state money by having the attorney general try to defend this potentially unconstitutional law against a lawsuit filed in federal court by voting-rights organizations.
And it’s not just an issue in New Hampshire. The U.S. House of Representatives passed H.R. 22, which would produce many of the same problems if it gets past the Senate. Republicans behind that bill ironically named it the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act.
Enough with the hypocrisy. We now know what these overly strict voter-registration laws do, whether they intended to or not. They don’t safeguard voters’ rights. They block them.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/votingregbills-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-01 04:56:21.229167

In September, Gov. Mike DeWine announced the start of the $10 million Child Care Cred Program. 
It’s available to families making between 200% and 400% of federal poverty guidelines. For a family of three, that’s $53,300 to $106,600 a year.
Under it, employees cover 40% of child care costs, employers cover 40% and the state covers the remainder.
“The new Child Care Cred Program is designed to help Ohio’s families get access to child care,” DeWine said in a written statement announcing the program. “And, when parents have quality childc are, Ohio’s employers have productive employees who are not worried about their kids during work. It is a win for Ohio’s working families and for businesses.”
Most economists surveyed about the program said it would be good for kids specifically.
Asked if the program would improve educational outcomes in Ohio, 13 said it would, three said it wouldn’t and three were uncertain, according to the survey, conducted by Scioto Analysis.
Many who agreed cited the quality of professional child care.
“There is pretty strong evidence that attending a quality daycare causes increased school performance, especially initially, and wages later in life,” David Brasington of the University of Cincinnati wrote in the comment section of the survey.
Meanwhile, his colleague, Michael Jones of the same university, made a counterargument.
“A growing body of research shows that mothers who spend more time at home with their young children, rather than rushing back to work, see better outcomes for both themselves and their children,” he wrote, later adding, “Ohio shouldn’t be creating incentives that encourage parents to spend less time with their children.”
An economist who was uncertain whether the program will benefit kids cited the small amount the state budgeted for it — $10 million. Compare that to the $600 million the legislature is giving the billionaire Haslam family to move the hapless Browns out of Cleveland. 
“I think that quality child care would improve educational outcomes but I am skeptical of this particular program,” wrote Curtis Reynolds of Kent State University. “It is a low amount of funding, it is not clear how many firms will participate and it does not last long. Could be an interesting ‘pilot’ but would need to be expanded to see effects.”
The economists were highly skeptical that work requirements for publicly funded child care would reduce unemployment rates. Just three said they would, nine said they wouldn’t, and seven were uncertain.
President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act seeks to cut nearly $1 trillion in Medicaid spending over 10 years, including through such work requirements. But research has shown that state-level programs cost people their benefits without having any impact on employment.
In terms of work requirements for Ohio’s child care benefit, Charles Kroncke of Mt. St. Joseph University said hassling families away from using it would undermine the program.
“Work requirements are a bureaucratic hurdle that will make child care less accessible to the people that need it most,” he wrote.
And Kevin Egan of the University of Toledo seemed to say the requirement was nonsensical.
“Why would you need work requirements for child care?” he wrote. “Parents only pay for child care when they are working.”",https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/child-care-1024x683-1.jpg,,,2025-12-01 04:56:21.229167

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)Coldwater residents have learned a valuable lesson: Actions have consequences.
Their town’s twice-elected mayor, Joe Ceballos, has been charged with felony voter fraud by Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach. Ceballos appears to have registered and cast ballots in multiple elections, despite not being a citizen. While you might expect townsfolk to respond with anger, that’s not the situation at all.
Indeed, a remarkable profile of Ceballos by veteran Kansas journalist Roy Wenzl shows a town shocked that such a good guy — “He’s more American than I am,” a friend said — would be charged. He’s a die-hard Republican in a place full of them. More than 83% of Comanche County voters picked Donald Trump for president last year. More than 78% appear to have chosen Kobach in 2022.
“If deportation happens, I can tell you that Kobach will have trouble showing up here, especially if he asks to stay with us for a while,” said Dennis Swayze, a rancher who mentored Ceballos.
But the attorney general hasn’t done anything wrong here. Kansas voters know precisely where Kobach stands and what he means to do. They have voted for him repeatedly. Trump, likewise, made no secret of his desire to oversee the largest deportation operation in U.S. history. Violent or nonviolent, with legal status or not, immigrants would be targeted.
That’s what Kobach and Trump promised.
Trump on immigrants in late 2023: “They let — I think the real number is 15, 16 million people into our country. When they do that, we got a lot of work to do. They’re poisoning the blood of our country.”
Kobach just last month on the Coldwater case: “It still effectively takes the vote away or cancels the vote of a U.S. citizen.”
Most town residents voted for these men. Whether they realize it or not, they’re getting what they wanted. On Election Day, they chose cruelty.
Expressions of dazed disbelief punctuate Wenzl’s story like infuriating landmines: “If you know Joe, you know Kobach picked the wrong guy” “Deportation would be, as I told Joe, like sending me to Egypt.” “He doesn’t take anything about America for granted.”
Residents who know Ceballos agonized about his voter registration, wondering if they should have provided better guidance. He made an honest mistake back in 1991, they say, and the mayor shouldn’t be made to pay the price.
But as they agonized, none appears to make the leap that their blind allegiance to a party that demonizes immigrants might have contributed to the problem.
Even today, even after these events, Ceballos’ friend Ryan Swayze offered this thumbnail political analysis: “Democrats think the government provides, while Republicans think the government should let us just do our thing.”
Republicans just let them do their thing, huh? Not in this case!
Here are some hard truths for the people of Coldwater.
As sure as if every Republican voter of Coldwater lined up to cast a stone at Ceballos, their choices at the ballot box in 2024 and 2022 had the same traumatic effect. They did this to their friend. They did this to their mayor. They did this to their beloved town fixture. And until they figure this out, our country and our state is not going to get better.
Take responsibility. Own up to your actions.
People whose brains have been liquefied by conservative propaganda believe they’re never to blame for adverse consequences. Setbacks always must be the doing of nefarious leftists. They’ve been turned into perpetual victims, always losing to a Clinton or an Obama or a Soros. But, of course, the fact is they’re part of one of the most successful political movements in American history. That political movement has goals and policies that are meant to be enacted.
If you demand responsibility and accountability from others, you must be willing to demand it from yourself as well. Follow conservative Republican beliefs to their logical conclusion and you will see many more good people punished for honest mistakes.
I didn’t feel great after reading Wenzl’s story. The mayor has all but admitted to the charges against him and said he voted in practically every election over the past 30-some years. If convicted of a felony, he seems likely to face deportation. Removal from the country could happen anyway, his lawyer fears.
That will leave Coldwater, Kansas and the United States all worse off. I sympathize with the mayor and wish state officials could show more empathy.
But that’s not what the majority of the public wanted. That’s not what Coldwater voted for. They should sit with that shame.
To paraphrase Walt Kelly: They have met the enemy and he is them.

(Courtesy of Holiday Lights Festival)Another “season” is upon us. Whether yours is a wish for a cool Yule, a joyous Kwanzaa, a happy Hanukkah or simply for the celebratory furor to be over without incident, December also comes with questions for Nebraska’s Congressional delegation. Thus we offer another hypothetical news conference for the Cornhusker quintet. 
Without further holiday ado, let’s unwrap some queries …

The White House has recently cut tariffs on foods such as coffee, beef, and some fruits and vegetables because of high prices, a move that runs counter to the administration’s notion that American consumers will not bear the brunt of increased import levies. Do you still believe we need to keep using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which takes the Constitutional requirement of setting tariffs out of your hands as members of Congress and puts it in the president’s? If so, could you explain what the emergency is?


Are you comfortable with the peace plan the administration is offering to end the war in Ukraine and the process by which it came about, given the short deadline for Ukraine to accept its points, the confusion surrounding its source and, most importantly, as was originally reported, the clear indication that it heavily favored Russia, who, as you recall, started the war?


What are your thoughts concerning the war in Gaza, especially since, according to the United Nations, nearly 340 Palestinian civilians, including 70 children, have died in Israeli bombings since an Oct. 25 cease-fire and peace plan took effect?


While the Senate met during the government shutdown, the House was adjourned for 54 days during most of which an Arizona Congressional district was without representation as Speaker Mike Johnson refused to swear her in. Even factoring in your “district work periods,” according to the 2025 calendar, the House was adjourned for nearly a third of its scheduled time in session. What message do you think that sends?


At the direction of Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert Kennedy Jr., the CDC has dredged from the dark corners of conspiracy

theories the debunked notion that vaccines cause autism. It has changed its web site to read “The claim ‘vaccines do not cause autism’ is not an evidence-based claim, because studies have not ruled out the possibility that infant vaccines cause autism.” Aside from any fallacies of logic involved — not to mention the more recent unproven claims about Tylenol — could you explain why a nation consistently on the cutting edge of scientific and medical progress would wallow in such misinformation? What might your role as a political leader be in reinforcing settled science?


At an Oval Office press gaggle during a visit from the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, the president threatened a television network’s license because its reporter asked a question about a Washington Post columnist’s murder, which the CIA has determined the crown prince ordered. This came on the heels of the president calling a female reporter “Piggy” as she attempted to ask the president a question aboard Air Force One. Were either of those exchanges acceptable and, in the larger sense, what is acceptable to you in the give and take between reporters and political leaders?


This question needs a little perspective, so please bear with me: Viola Fletcher, known affectionately as “Mother Fletcher,” died last week at the age 111. As you may know, she was the oldest living survivor of the Tulsa Massacre, the riot in which white mobs killed 300 Black Tulsans, injured another 800 people and left 9,000 homeless. Fletcher’s death reminds us of the White House’s push to eliminate anything it believes smacks of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) or, in its mind, is “divisive.” The policy has led to the removal of books, commemorations, curriculums and other remembrances of Black Americans from public spaces. Indeed, plaques commemorating Black soldiers who fought the Nazis in World War II were recently removed from a Netherlands cemetery where 174 of them are buried. How, in your mind, do these efforts to appease anti-DEI forces square with actual history?


Curious about how much — if at all — it bothers you that no evidence has been provided to determine whether any of the boats we have destroyed in the Atlantic and Pacific were actually carrying drugs and, if so, were their fuel capacities large enough to make it to the U.S.


Should the FBI be interviewing six members of Congress for saying something that is already said to military personnel during training and is protected under the Constitution’s Speech and Debate Clause?

For small business owners, AI is no longer a buzzword — it’s becoming a cornerstone of business strategy.AI tools drive innovation, efficiency and growth, making them essential for staying competitive in an increasingly digital and data-driven world. According to JPMorgan Chase’s 2025 Business Leaders Outlook Survey, a strong majority (80%) of small business leaders are already using or are planning to implement AI. However, almost half (46%) are cautiously optimistic about its impact on their business. This year, 48% of small business owners plan to integrate AI tools, focusing on customer-facing applications like chatbots and customer service automation. Continued investment in AI and technology to enhance efficiency and competitiveness is a priority for this year and beyond.Emerging technologies are among key considerations for small business owners planning for the future, ensuring business continuity, fostering growth and planning for successful transitions.
The Potential of AI
AI offers capabilities in learning, reasoning and problem-solving. In the Survey, small business owners identified several key applications for AI, including marketing and content creation, customer service automation and data analysis. AI can also benefit payment processes and other operational automation.Large Language Models, a subset of AI, excel in processing and generating human-like text, making them invaluable for content creation and customer interaction. Integrating these technologies can streamline processes and boost productivity.
Why Emerging Technologies Could Benefit Small Businesses
With limited resources, small business can automate routine tasks with AI, allowing employees to focus on higher-value activities. AI-driven chatbots can manage initial customer requests, reducing the workload on customer service teams and improving response times, ultimately increasing customer satisfaction.
Additionally, AI can empower startups to expand operations by complementing their existing workforce. For instance, an e-commerce startup can use AI to efficiently manage inventory, process orders and assist with customer inquiries, allowing the team to focus on strategic growth and customer engagement.
Small businesses can also develop tools tailored to their needs, rather than relying on broad third-party solutions. This approach offers greater flexibility, easier integration and tighter control over data.
Automation tools enhance efficiency, while data-driven solutions like Chase for Business’s Customer Insights – a business intelligence tool that generates actionable insights from anonymized, aggregated data – help streamline operations and enhance the bottom line.
The Path Forward As innovations continue to emerge rapidly, consider developing a blueprint to identify where AI adds value, creating a roadmap for implementation and investing in the necessary infrastructure and talent. As you plan for growth and scaling, understand transition options to ensure a successful small business future.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/27081755/9-Photo-Harnessing-Emerging-Technologies-to-Power-Your-Business.jpg.jpeg,,,2025-12-01 02:58:21.499906

The values cited have mostly to do with gender roles and sexuality: women should submit to their husbands and embrace childbearing and childcare as their primary functions; gender identity variability is unbiblical and corrosive to morality; and a godless society is doomed to collapse.

John Hall
These claims are not new; we have heard them coming from conservative Christians over the past 50 or even 150 years. What is new, and surprising, is that these same citizens have turned their religious zeal into devotion to a political demagogue, dismissing  glaring moral flaws they once held to be disqualifying. The common ground between religious fundamentalism and our government’s authoritarian character is disdain and anger toward secular liberals, intellectual and economic elites who, so the argument goes, hate America and are the cause of our problems.
But what we have is not a reasonable, civil discourse on political science. It’s a deluge of bizarre disagreements or plain lies about simple facts, even when evidence supporting the facts is clear and compelling. Deeper still is a tangle of emotions arising from loss following rapid cultural and economic change: anger, alienation, fear of more loss, and changes in the status of racial and class groups. To unravel it all is beyond the scope of this essay, but some constructive light may be shed by reflecting on another period of cultural, religious, and intellectual change.
Our nation’s founders were generally cautious, if not downright skeptical, when it came to religious enthusiasm and divisive sectarian claims. Still fresh in the public memory were the demonization and torture of religious “heretics” and “witches” in the colonies. 
Before that were the senseless religious wars and chaos of 16th and 17th century Europe. The leaders of the constitutional convention were Deists —Enlightenment rationalists who conceived of God as the creator who set the cosmos in motion, then left it alone without subsequent intervention. This view relegated God to more of a supporting role on the stage of the human drama —a God that was providential but not in charge of the details. The authority of the Bible was starting to fray, as scholars struggled with its miraculous and mythological content.
With the publication of Darwin’s On the Origin of Species in 1859, religion in the western world faced a more singular crisis. The book popularized hard evidence that God had not created all forms of life during seven days, but that life had evolved gradually over a much longer timespan. Many clergy and other opinion-makers accepted the new time scale, taking the position that God drove the process of evolution itself, though that suggested that God was something more abstract, not the human-like God who made Adam from the mud and Eve from a rib. 
More conservative defenders of the faith opposed the fact of evolution bluntly, using theatrical slogans such as “man didn’t come from apes.” But after some decades, the scientific community and members of the public who took the time to understand the evidence for Darwin’s theory accepted evolution as a compelling explanation for the diversity of life and its ongoing changes.  The wobbly legs of Biblical authority were now disturbingly visible.
Protestant fundamentalism was born in the late 19th century as a reaction to Darwin’s book and a bulwark against this erosion of Biblical authority and the related threat to Christians’ cultural status. Fundamentalist leaders proclaimed a strategic retreat, a refusal to engage in evidence-based debate about religious truth. The party line was simple: true believers should not be tempted by the rational conceits of a fallen and godless world, exemplified by university scholars, including Biblical scholars. The Bible was the inerrant Word of God, period. 
Any so-called “evidence” that the earth was millions or billions of years old was not admissible in the court of God’s judgment. Even today, some congregations have an unspoken covenant to reject the theory of evolution as an attack on faith. Some Christians even reject the specific findings of geologists, proposing that God planted a deceptive fossil record in the layers of mountain rock to test our faith.
But there is another reason why evolution was and still is such a key concept when it comes to understanding fundamentalist religion. If life evolved as a succession of atoms, bigger atoms, molecules, self-replicating molecules, and up the evolutionary tree to intelligent animals, culture, and technology, then religions evolved too. That suggests that the Bible did not come straight from God fully formed, but rather evolved through a succession of beliefs, rituals, and earlier texts —like everything else in human culture, all of it going back to the primal soup. Of course, we have ample textual evidence that the Bible did evolve, but to concede that, for some, was to lose the game entirely.
Evolution is, for some religionists, an inconvenient fact because it legitimizes change and complicates the search for absolutes. Denying evolution, on the other hand, serves as a balm for those most hurt by rapid social change and who long to reverse that change. Autocracies thrive when large segments of the population have experienced loss of community pride, economic viability, and status when compared to others who were luckier. For autocrats, facts simply get in the way of delegitimizing critics’ expertise and capitalizing on loss and anger to seduce segments of the population into believing that the situation is hopeless without the authoritarian’s exercise of power. In our present case, religious fundamentalists and the allies of autocracy find unity in opposing their stated common enemy: secular liberals.
But facts are not something we can afford to ignore. And the demonization of those who see the world differently is not a path to healing our society and solving problems in ways we can all live with. 
Religion tempered by reason enriches people’s lives in many ways —providing space where people can belong, reminding us of our fallibilities, and helping us not to despair of our certain death. But religion, like any absorption in an ideological or utopian vision, involves some degree of magical thinking. It is not an appropriate tool when it comes to vaccine safety, just as ignoring the facts about tariffs and using them to exercise imagined grievance will not help us manage the economy.
We occupy a crowded planet, changing fast due to accelerating technology. Our challenges call for complex strategies anchored in the physical world to generate food and energy, avoid disease, keep the peace, and minimize the damage we do to the life around us. Depending on a God, a demagogue, or an ideology to save us from our own appetites and impulses is not a serious plan for self-government. 
It’s up to all of us, hearing each other, understanding each other more deeply, and evaluating various policy prescriptions in search of solutions. That is the messy, difficult, and essential struggle of democracy.

It does.
Unless you’re a developer, a lobbyist, or a fetus.
Members are filing hell-born bills for the 2026 session, many apparently designed to torment you, rob your children of their futures, and reduce this state to an ICE-filled, disease ridden, constantly flooding, unaffordable autocracy.
Perhaps you cherish Florida’s natural beauty: the trees, the springs, the beaches, the wetlands.
Enjoy them while you can.
Sen. Stan McClain, R-Ocala, has filed a bill to forbid local government regulation of, and restrictions on, development.
SB 208 would allow all manner of unrestricted housing to be built wherever, whenever, even if the city objects because, say, it violates their comp plans, harms the character of a neighborhood, or pollutes.
You will not be shocked to learn Sen. McClain’s profession is “residential contractor.”
It gets worse: HB 479 would ensure sprawl, clear-cutting, and wetlands destruction can proceed unimpeded by any city or county trying to manage growth or protect local quality of life.
Environmental watchdogs call it “one of the worst water bills” they’ve ever seen.
This stinker’s sponsor is Rep. Randy Maggard of Pasco County. He may have been inspired by his nephew’s desire to build a house in Dade City’s La Jovita Golf and Country Club community, where homeowners pride themselves on living in harmony with wildlife.
As reported by Craig Pittman, it seems Zach Maggard broke an impressive number of rules, running a concrete boat ramp through wetlands and chopping down protected trees.
The project disappeared a bald eagle nest. Naturally, he suffered no consequences.
Next thing you know, his uncle is working to kneecap those pesky ordinances so everybody can go wild monetizing every inch of ground.
If your town wants to protect the wetlands that mitigate flooding, filter your drinking water, and foster birds and fish, or perhaps want to stop a project that would rip out the mangroves that sequester carbon, reduce storm surge, and slow down erosion, or maybe refuse a permit for, say, a huge gas station on top of a cave system connected to one of the state’s most iconic springs, you’ll be flat out of luck.
Of course, the federal government might kill Florida before Florida can kill itself.
The Trump administration wants to narrow the definition of “Waters of the United States” — which are protected by the Clean Water Act — removing protections from 80% of the nation’s wetlands.
They also want to drill in the eastern Gulf of Mexico.
Anybody remember the BP oil spill?
Control
There’s no aspect of human life the Legislature doesn’t mean to control.
You should not be LGBTQ. Or demonstrate support for LGBTQ people.
Once again, lawmakers want to ban Pride flags outside government buildings.
God forbid somebody display a piece of cloth with a rainbow, signifying inclusiveness and welcome.
“Historical” flags, the Confederate battle flag, for example, will be allowed — in case you’re wondering what Republicans really care about.
Like gay people and flags, women must also be highly regulated.
Sen. Erin Grall has, once again, got her “fetal personhood” bill past the Judiciary Committee.
SB 164 would allow parents to sue for damages over the death of a fetus deemed “wrongful,” even if the fetus couldn’t have survived outside the womb.
That fetus is an American citizen.
“Survivors” could try to recover “lost earnings” of what the bill calls the “unborn child,” defined as a “member of the species Homo sapiens, at any stage of development, who is carried in the womb,” maybe on the theory it might have grown up to become a movie star like George Clooney or start a company like Nvidia and be worth billions.
Grall has long pushed legislation to control women’s bodies.
When Florida passed a six-week abortion ban in 2023, Grall, a sponsor, said, “Abortion has touched every single one of us, and we should grieve for what we have done as a country.”
That incest victim, that 16-year-old who didn’t know she was pregnant until she was past the time limit, would probably disagree.
Since women no longer have reproductive freedom in the Free State of Florida, it might be best if they just refrain from having sex.
“Freedom” in Florida means freedom from compassion for the poor, freedom from learning, freedom from the consequences of racism and prejudice, and freedom from science-based medicine.
Our state surgeon general has decreed children don’t need to be vaccinated against hepatitis B, chickenpox, haemophilus type B, and pneumococcal conjugate virus to go to school.
Now he and Gov. Ron DeSantis want the Legislature to roll back other vaccine mandates, including polio, pertussis, measles, mumps, diptheria, and rubella.
If that’s not enough, Erin Grall has another bill to protect you from your own health.
SB 408 says that if you get a vaccine and it “harms” you, and if that vaccine was advertised in the state of Florida on TV, radio, in print, via product placement, or online influencers, you can sue the manufacturer.
The measure does not define “harm.” Is a sore arm or a low-grade fever “harm”?
Anaphylaxis? Death?
A serious allergic reaction to a vaccine is possible, but it’s vanishingly rare.
Much rarer than, say, getting severely sick or even dying because you think the jab is some evil plot to impair your precious bodily fluids.
This lawsuit nonsense isn’t about sound medicine. The thin (one page) bill might attract all manner of even more extreme amendments.
Go ahead, risk your kid’s health; let your kid become a walking disease factory.
Guns
And if your kid makes it to 18, why not let him or her buy a nice, scary gun?
After 17 died in the mass shooting at Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School on Valentine’s Day, 2018, the Florida Legislature did the right thing, passing a bill to limit the purchase of semi-automatic rifles to those 21 and up.
That bill, signed into law by noted liberal Rick Scott, was such an affront to the House of Representatives and their NRA overlords, they keep trying to roll it back.
For three years, House Republicans proposed repealing the law.
Why not go back to allowing 18-year olds to buy themselves a Smith & Wesson M&P 15, just like Nicholas Cruz did?
So far, the Senate has shut these bills down.
But this is Florida and 2026 is an election year, so who knows?
Taxes
Thank God for Republicans’ Klown Kar ideas for eliminating property taxes: a bit of comic relief in these dark days.
The Legislature will consider no fewer than eight proposals, one eliminating non-school taxes altogether (HJR 201), one phasing out non-school taxes over 10 years (HJR 203), another exempting Florida residents over 65 from non-school homestead taxes (HJR 205), yet another limiting assessed value to 3% over three years for homestead property and 15% for non-homestead property, also over three years (HJR 213).
And a partridge in a pear tree.
OK, that last one is made up, but you get the idea.
Ron DeSantis despises all of them.
(He despises a lot of things, but he really loathes what he sees as the House of Representatives’ gaggle of tax-cutting ideas).
The governor calls them “milquetoast,” unserious, and “weak.”
Speaker of the House Daniel Perez points out DeSantis “has not produced a plan on property taxes. Period.”
Perez adds, “I’ve personally reached out to share with him the House’s proposals and he has, so far, not wanted to engage in a conversation.”
A cynical person might suspect DeSantis might be running for higher office in 2028 and wants to claim he “liberated” Floridians from the terrible burden of paying for local police, fire services, libraries, parks, and road repair.
They all need to get a move on if they want to get one (or more!) of these bad ideas onto the 2026 ballot.
In any case, watching the Legislature and our testy governor duke it out will be entertaining, and God knows, we’ll need some fun come January.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_0102-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-01 00:56:30.859551

But our healthcare system does, deeply.","As a public health student, first in college, now in grad school, I’ve heard the same message in almost every class: progress isn’t real progress unless everyone moves forward. On World AIDS Day, I’m reminded of how far that ideal is from reality.
We celebrate enormous scientific breakthroughs, like this summer’s FDA approval of a twice-yearly HIV-prevention injection, yet the people who need these tools most rarely have access to them.
For refugee, migrant, and asylum-seeking communities globally, HIV risk is shaped by forces far beyond individual behavior. Displacement strips people of healthcare access, exposes them to sexual violence, and forces survival decisions no one should face.
 Women and girls are disproportionately harmed. These same pressures —trauma from displacement, unstable legal status, disrupted care, and chronic underinsurance—follow refugees long after they arrive here in Connecticut. Yet, we have almost no U.S.-specific data on these risks because we do not systematically track them. In Connecticut and throughout the U.S., access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and prevention tools like PrEP is closely tied to legal status. When treatment is delayed or interrupted, people develop AIDS and drug-resistant HIV strains emerge, creating a slew of avoidable public health threats. 
The painful irony is that HIV is now one of the most preventable and treatable infectious diseases on the planet. PrEP reduces HIV risk by more than 99%, and ART allows people to live long, healthy lives. Scientifically and financially, it is within reach to end HIV transmission–and subsequently, AIDS–altogether. But none of that matters if immigrant, asylum-seeking, and undocumented families can’t get near these medications. Barriers appear at every step: insurance eligibility rules, pharmacy refusals, complex paperwork, or simply the fear of interacting with institutions that could jeopardize someone’s status.
We don’t have to look beyond our own cities to see these consequences. New Haven’s refugee health and resettlement programs are closing after a $5 million federal funding cut, combined with new federal restrictions; another hit after years of reductions that began under the Trump administration and never fully reversed. In a city where 17% of residents are immigrants, most remain disconnected from HIV prevention and care. When our local resettlement agencies close, it’s not just case management that disappears. Healthcare access disappears with it.
Even programs meant to close gaps often unintentionally reinforce them. Yale New Haven Health’s Financial Assistance Program is open to all residents, but the administrative hurdles make it incredibly difficult and frustrating for many immigrant families to navigate. The Yale Refugee Health Program is a thoughtful, trauma-informed model staffed by committed clinicians, but it can only serve refugees who arrive through formal federal pathways. That excludes asylum seekers, whose cases may take years; humanitarian parolees; and undocumented families who arrived with the same need for safety and stability.
As someone new to the Northeast, living in New Haven often feels like its own version of A Tale of Two Cities. It’s not lost on me that I sit in classrooms at one of the wealthiest universities in the world, learning about cutting-edge HIV prevention tools and trials, and then walk outside into a community where many residents cannot access them at all. 
HIV does not care about borders, documentation status, or visa categories. But our healthcare system does, deeply. When we tie basic prevention and treatment to immigration status, we don’t just create illness; we undermine our own national goals to “end the HIV/AIDS epidemic.” We cannot claim progress while structurally excluding the very communities most in need.
The good news is that solutions exist, and Connecticut can adopt them. California created a statewide program offering PrEP regardless of insurance or immigration status. Some cities have adopted “don’t ask, don’t report” policies, ensuring clinics do not become de facto immigration enforcement sites. Connecticut could do the same. We could expand the state PrEP Assistance Program to cover all residents. We could support pharmacies and clinics in serving people without documentation. And we could restore state-level funding for resettlement agencies, because their absence leaves a gap no cutting-edge scientific breakthrough can fill.
World AIDS Day, December 1, should not be a moment of self-congratulation. It should be a reminder that epidemics, like HIV/AIDS, are social before they are biological. As the daughter and granddaughter of immigrants, I know what it means when systems quietly signal that certain people don’t count.
If we are truly serious about ending HIV in this state and this country, then everyone must have a seat at the table. Until refugees and migrants are fully included in prevention and care, not as an afterthought but as a priority, HIV/AIDS will remain a disease of exclusion. And as U.S. healthcare continues to show us, it is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society.

(Photo Courtesy of Pam D'Angelo)When Chesapeake Bay governors and other leaders gather at the National Aquarium on Tuesday to consider the next bay clean-up agreement, they’ll be joined by leaders from several federally recognized Native American tribes in Virginia.
The tribal leaders will present a symbolic gift of wild rice, to represent growing a partnership between the tribes and state and federal leaders — who are about to spend seven months determining whether the tribes can have a seat at the table as decisions are made about the bay.
It’s taken almost a year for tribes to even get to this point.
“We’ve come such a long way from where we started — which was another absence, which was no conversation,” said Melissa Ann Ehrenreich, executive director of the Indigenous Conservation Council. The council was formed in 2022 to represent the seven Virginia tribes that gained federal recognition between 2015 and 2018.
The tribes formally asked to be included as signatories to the next bay agreement, only to run up against the layers of bureaucracy at the Bay Program that Ehrenreich concedes have proven stifling.
“It has been frustrating to participate at multiple different levels and feel like: ‘Wow, why couldn’t we have done this over the last year?’” Ehrenreich asked. “The bay can’t wait.”

The yearlong delay is partially about timing: The Bay Program is led by the executive council, which includes Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D) and other governors in the watershed, who only convene once a year. At its last meeting, in Annapolis last December, the council only directed staff to revise the bay agreement — not to add signatories.
That was the reason cited in a June letter in response to the tribes.
A document going before the governors on Tuesday will give Bay Program officials the go-ahead to study tribal inclusion, and “develop recommendations by July 1, 2026, on how best to include tribes across the watershed in the Chesapeake Bay Program (CBP) partnership.”
That could include adding the tribes, or the ICC, to the Bay agreement as a signatory, on equal footing with Maryland and the other states, according to the document.
The document also states that officials “may prepare a draft memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the federally recognized tribes within the watershed outlining CBP partner expectations and commitments, recognizing budgetary and resource needs and constraints,” the document continues.
The tribes are approaching the Bay Program at a difficult juncture for the agreement.
The states in the watershed failed to reach pollution-cutting goals outlined in the previous agreement by 2025, forcing them back to the drawing board to revise their pact. After months of deliberation, the states and federal officials agreed to a 2040 deadline for those same pollution reductions.
The proposed new plan also updates a host of other goals, including for underwater grass acreage, wetland restoration and forest conservation. But some environmentalists have raised alarm that some of the goals were revised downward compared to the earlier version, making them easier for the bay states to achieve.
Even with a series of bay agreements dating back to the 1980s, improving conditions in the bay has proven a challenge. In the late ‘80s, water quality testing determined that 26.5% of the bay’s tidal waters met standards. Today, that number is 29.4%. Bay Program officials view it as a victory, since they’re up against climate change and increasing development and population in the watershed.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Not everyone agrees.
“The effort is expensive, and it’s failing. They’re not making any progress at all, hardly,” said Chief Frank Adams of the Upper Mattaponi Indian Tribe, an ICC member, in an interview last month. “Why keep doing the same thing over and over? Let’s try something else. Let’s include the Native cultural knowledge and Native people.”
Part of the problem is that East Coast states are unaccustomed to considering tribal governments, with federally recognized tribes a rarity, Adams said.
“This is the first time the state of Virginia has ever had a federally recognized tribe, and they didn’t know how to deal with us,” Adams said. “Up and down the East Coast and the states that are feeding into the Chesapeake Bay: Pennsylvania, Maryland, all the other states, have no federally recognized tribes, so it was not even a thought that they should include the sovereign nations of Virginia into the discussion.”
Adams argues that tribes have lots to contribute. After the Upper Mattaponi won federal recognition, for instance, an environmental department was the first to be established, using grant funding. Adams said the department now has five staff members and focuses on issues including battling invasive fish. Other Virginia tribes have taken a similar approach.
Tribal leaders said they were not expecting the Bay Program to have such a lengthy procedure for considering their inclusion.
“I just saw it as more walls of colonialism — that [they] had not had Indigenous people involved,” said Chief Anne Richardson of the Rappahannock Tribe, an ICC member, in a November interview.

“And they felt there was no need to have Indigenous people involved at that level, although all of our watersheds are feeding off of the bay, and we’ve stewarded the bay and these rivers for thousands of years — and did a good job, without the millions and billions of dollars that the government seems to be pouring into it now,” she said.
In fact, the very name of the Chesapeake Bay is derived from an Algonquian word, Chesapiooc.
“We just want a seat at the table, so that we have decision-making authority, just like everybody else that sits at the table,” Richardson said. “You would think in 2025 that wouldn’t be an issue, but obviously it is.”
Leaders at the Bay Program say they aren’t throwing hurdles in front of the tribes.
“It’s not a ‘no.’ And it’s not like if you miss this boat, we move on,” said Anna Killius, executive director of the Chesapeake Bay Commission, during an interview earlier this year. The commission is a signatory on the bay agreement which represents lawmakers from Maryland, Pennsylvania and Virginia.
In more recent comments, Bay Program officials said they’re optimistic about future discussions with the tribes.
“Indigenous communities in this region have thousands of years of insight into land and water management that the Chesapeake Bay Program can greatly benefit from as we continue our work to improve Chesapeake Bay water quality and wildlife,” said Leila Duman, bays restoration officer for the Maryland Department of Natural Resources.
“Maryland is supportive of the efforts to include representatives from these communities more formally as part of the Chesapeake Bay Program,” Duman said. “We look forward to participating in the next steps.”
Virginia officials declined to comment through the Bay Program, but added that their sentiment is similar to Maryland’s.
Dan Coogan, a 20-year EPA veteran who was named Bay Program director in October, said the “EPA and the Bay Partners are working with those federally recognized tribal nations to develop recommendations on how best to include tribes across the watershed. EPA looks forward to this discussion at the upcoming Executive Council meeting.”

If the Virginia tribes were to win signatory status on the Bay agreement, and representation on the executive council, it would be a relatively rare occurrence in the United States, said Lauren Wiederkehr, a law student at the University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law, who studied the issue as a summer law clerk this year for the Chesapeake Legal Alliance.
The closest analogy might be the Puget Sound Partnership in Washington, which currently includes two Indigenous representatives on its leadership council.
One of them is Russell Hepfer, 69, a member of the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe, who has been serving on the Puget Sound leadership council since 2014. Hepfer said that fishing rights treaties between tribes and state governments make inclusion more commonplace at groups like the Puget Sound Partnership.
He said it has also helped that he could follow in the footsteps of other tribal leaders, including Billy Frank Jr., a Nisqually tribal member and well-known activist for tribal fishing rights in the Pacific Northwest who served on the leadership council as well.
But just getting a seat on the leadership council wasn’t enough: It’s a constant battle to educate others in leadership about tribes and their roles, Hepfer said.
“When people leave, retire, or whatever happens, you have to re-educate the next person,” he said.
Hepfer, who has served on the tribal council of the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe for 24 years, said he views that education as a personal mission.
“We’re still a second-class group, but we have to keep telling our story,” he said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Sept-2024-Bd-Mtg-Pamela-DAngelo-cropped-e1764531693957-1024x691.jpeg,,,2025-11-30 22:57:13.004635

(Photo by Lanny Hartmann)Maryland set a bold goal of 1.1 million electric vehicles on the road by 2030. With just shy of 150,000 EVs registered as of October 2025, the state has ground to make up.
That growth depends on a public charging network that is reliable, affordable and widely available, especially for apartment and condo dwellers without home charging and for drivers crossing the state on longer trips. Public charging must keep pace. Yet a new regulation from the Maryland Department of Agriculture threatens to do the opposite.
Starting Jan. 1, 2026, every public charging station in Maryland that accepts payment must register with the state’s Weights and Measures program and pay a $150 annual fee. That is per port. A simple four-plug Level 2 station at a grocery store, office garage, or apartment complex now owes Maryland $600 a year just to remain in service.

The state calls it a registration fee. In practice, it operates as a $150-per-port tax, perhaps the highest in the nation. For comparison, Maryland charges gas stations only $20 to register each fuel dispenser. An EV charging plug now costs 7.5 times more to keep legal than a gasoline nozzle.
The Maryland Department of Agriculture is gearing up for enforcement. Chargers not registered by Jan. 1 face being red-tagged with a stop-use order. This removes the unit from service entirely. Every fix requires a registered service agency to sign off on repairs, and those technicians charge real money.
In spring 2026, state inspectors will arrive with certified test equipment to verify that each charger meters electricity within tolerances. New chargers must be certified before operating. The cost of compliance begins long before the first kilowatt-hour is sold.
Large fast-charging networks will simply take this in stride and raise rates a few cents. The damage falls hardest on low-margin Level 2 stations that drivers rely on daily. Apartment complexes, hotel lots, small retail centers, and office buildings often run these chargers at break-even or as customer perks.
A substantial yearly charger tax transforms a goodwill gesture into a financial liability. Many hosts will run the numbers, see red ink, and simply rip out the equipment rather than pass the cost to users or risk repeated red tags for minor violations.
Charger hosts lose the incentive to keep stations online. Drivers lose convenient charging options. The public charging network shrinks at the exact moment Maryland needs it to expand.
By 2026, compliant chargers will sport a little MDA decal proving they are registered. What many won’t see will be the faint outlines on the pavement where perfectly functional Level 2 chargers once stood, quietly removed because the juice just wasn’t worth the squeeze.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/54918991226_f8b0d3035c_o-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-30 21:56:45.176857
,Mississippi Today,2025-12-01 01:07:24+00:00,Mississippi Today,"For Rebels’ new boss Pete Golding, the coaching bug first bit at Delta State",Rick Cleveland,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/11/30/pete-golding-ole-miss-delta-state/,"The new head football coach at Ole Miss, Pete Golding, is known as a strong recruiter who builds bonds with high school coaches and prospective players.","First things first: Pete Golding, the new head football coach at Ole Miss, could not be more different from his predecessor, Lane Kiffin. Put it this way: You will not likely find Golding spending his Oxford mornings in a hot yoga class.

You are more likely to find 41-year-old Golding on the phone with recruits, watching tape, doodling football plays or spending what spare time he has with wife, Carolyn, who has three degrees from Ole Miss, and their three children. Golding, the Rebels’ defensive coordinator, was promoted to head coach Sunday after Kiffin announced his own departure for LSU.
Said Scott Eyster, Golding’s childhood pal and football teammate at both Hammond High School in Louisiana and from 2002 to 2005 at Delta State University: “Pete told me a long, long time ago, when he first got into coaching, he was someday gonna be the head football coach at Ole Miss. I texted him congratulations today, that dreams really do come true. I am so happy for him. He had earned this. He has worked so hard for this. Ole Miss football is in good hands.”
Eyster, a four-time Conerly Trophy finalist, and Golding have been friends since they were in diapers. Their fathers coached football together at Hammond High. They took a recruiting visit together to Delta State, along with another Hammond teammate, Ryan Barker.
Rick Rhoades, the Delta State head coach at the time, remembers that visit vividly. 
“Ryan Barker, the center, was the player we really wanted,” Rhoades said. “He asked if he could bring two of his Hammond teammates along. One was Eyster, who turned into a great college quarterback, and the other was this little bitty fellow named Pete Golding.
“Back then, you could work players out on a recruiting visit and I put Pete through some drills,” Rhoades continued. “Once I saw him run, I told him, ‘Son, I don’t know how much scholarship money we have left, but whatever we have left is yours.’ He turned into a great player for us.”
Golding was a four-year starter at safety for really good Delta State teams. He remains third on the DSU career tackles list and fourth in career pass interceptions.
“Pete was just a little ball of energy,” Rhoades said. “And he had great football instincts. He always seemed to know where the ball was going. He was always a step ahead. When you recruit, you start with finding guys who really love football – not just the Saturday part, but the practice and the preparation and all that comes with it. That was Pete. He made an impact the first day and when he ran out of eligibility we corralled him and made a graduate assistant coach out of him. He’s smart as a whip. I knew he would make a great coach, and he has.”
Golding has earned the reputation of being a accomplished recruiter, no matter where he has coached, from Delta State, to Southeastern Louisiana, to Southern Miss, to Texas-San Antonio, to Alabama and now Ole Miss.
Said Eyster, “Recruiting comes naturally to Pete. He’s a people person. People gravitate towards him. He doesn’t meet a stranger”
Eyster’s words reminded this writer of a day three years ago at the state high school championships played that year in Hattiesburg at USM’s Roberts Stadium. Both Kiffin and Golding were there that day to recruit Suntarine Perkins, the best player in the state, from Raleigh. Dozens of coaches – Mississippi high school coaches and college football recruiters – were standing beyond the north end zone watching the game. At one end of the end zone was Kiffin, all alone, talking on his cellphone nearly the entire game. At the other end was Golding, who was constantly being greeted by Mississippi high school coaches. They all knew him and he them. I never saw Kiffin talk to anyone.
I told Eyster that story, and he laughed. “That’s Pete right there,” he said. “That’s why he recruits so well.”
Now then, all this doesn’t necessarily mean that Golding will become a successful big-time college football head coach. If I’ve learned anything in more than a half century of doing this, it’s that the biggest transition in coaching is from being a coordinator to becoming a head coach. Being the CEO – with all the management and distractions that come with it – isn’t for everyone. Time will tell with Golding.
This much does seem certain: Given the situation in which Ole Miss finds itself, Golding would appear by far the best choice to lead 11-1, sixth-ranked Rebels into the playoffs and beyond. His players appear to both love and respect him. The announcement of Golding’s promotion at a team meeting Sunday reportedly was greeted with loud, prolonged cheering from the players.
Said Keith Carter, the athletic director, “Today’s meeting was a clear indicator of Pete’s ability to galvanize our squad. All of our players and coaches are ecstatic and ready to lock arms for a playoff run.”
Carter also said that Golding “has demonstrated an exceptional football mind, but more than that has shown a deep understanding of our culture, values and what it means to be part of the Ole Miss family. Simply put, Pete is one of us.”
What Carter left unsaid is clear: Kiffin, for all his success, never felt like family at Ole Miss. His messy departure potentially could have torpedoed the program. 
For all Kiffin’s success – and his posturing –  he should have known there was no way Ole Miss would let LSU’s football coach lead Ole Miss into the playoffs. That was pure heresy, despite what all the ESPN talking heads would tell you. Far, far better to give the reins to a guy, Pete Golding, who has always wanted the job he now has.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/30180352/Ole-Miss-football-coach-Pete-Golding.jpg,,,2025-11-30 20:57:33.119330

(Photo by Clayton Henkel/NC Newsline) As students and workers resume their routines after the Thanksgiving holiday, Siembra NC is warning that the organization has received multiple credible reports to indicate that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is deploying more agents to the Raleigh area for a monthlong operation.
“While we know that this news might cause alarm, we have no sense that ICE is planning the kind of activity that we saw Border Patrol do,” said Siembra NC co-director Nikki Marín Baena in a Sunday call with reporters. “The report that we got is that 50 additional agents were going to be deployed to North Carolina for activity starting December 1st.”

The grassroots immigrants rights organization has also had reports that ICE has reserved the same charter flights between Charlotte and Florida’s Jacksonville International Airport as they did last week, scheduled from Dec. 2 to Dec. 6.
Marín Baena declined to talk further about the origin of the information, and NC Newsline was not able to independently confirm it.
Marín Baena noted said the arrests ICE has typically made throughout this year have made it nearly impossible to get to school and work safely. Siembra NC launched the website Ojo Obrero in November to give communities a better sense of where federal enforcement activity has taken place.
“Businesses are being disrupted, classrooms are being disrupted, even people who have become naturalized U.S. citizens are doubting whether they are safe or thinking about what they need to do in the case of these operations,” Marín Baena said.
Many naturalized U.S. citizens and green card holders have started to carry their passports just to go grocery shopping.
“My own parents are naturalized U.S. citizens, and we had to talk about what would happen, what they should do, were they stopped by a border patrol agent,” Marín Baena said.
She believes the anticipated ICE’s operation in Raleigh comes as the result of remarks made by North Carolina House Speaker Destin Hall. Last week, Hall told The News & Observer that ICE and the border patrol were doing important work.
“It looks like they’re doing a pretty good job at it right now. And so, we don’t have much to ask, other than to come back,” Hall said.
Siembra is encouraging North Carolinians who have been impacted by the recent detentions to contact Hall’s office.
“We think that they listen to their own campaign contributors. And so, a few key contributors to Speaker Dustin Hall include political action committees with the N.C. Home Builders Association, Duke Energy and Lowe’s Home Improvement,” said Marín Baena. “We are inviting people to write letters and create illustrated cards to Speaker Hall’s top campaign contributors, specifically explaining why children and their parents should not have to live in fear.”
For business owners who have closed because employees are sheltering in place, Siembra NC is inviting people to post placards explaining that they’re closed “Courtesy of Speaker Destin Hall.”

The organization has also suggested that immigrant workers who miss work because they are sheltering in place can send a “Destin Hall Pass” to their employer.
Hall said on social media that he supports the enforcement action and that Gov. Joh Stein should be “more concerned about the safety of our citizens than protecting criminal illegal aliens.” Hall also faulted Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden for blocking previous ICE detainers and putting undocumented immigrants back onto the streets.
“They’re stepping in to clean up his mess and restore safety to the city,” Hall said in a Nov. 17 post on X expressing support for the Border Patrol.
Over the holiday weekend, Homeland Security officials pivoted to focus on the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, D.C.
President Donald Trump announced on Thanksgiving that he intends to “permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries.”
The five-day crackdown by Border Patrol in North Carolina resulted in 370 arrests.
Marín Baena said Sunday that many of those detained could eventually see charges dismissed.
“And we actually don’t know, of those 370 people, how many they’ve already had to let go because they were actually U.S. citizens or green card holders and how many they will have to let go because we’ve documented that they were unconstitutional arrests,” she said.
Marín Baena said she hopes that ICE’s plans change and it does not resume indiscriminate arrests in North Carolina in December. But if they do return, she says immigrant advocates are prepared.
“Thousands of people across the state of North Carolina have received training to get their neighbors safely to school, safely to work. And so, we are a little bit more prepared at this moment in time.”

The 18 recipients of the Resilient Food Systems Infrastructure grant are located throughout the state and include farms, farmers markets and other organizations that “increase capacity for processing, aggregation and distribution of local foods.”
The projects themselves range from construction, equipment purchases and facility expansion and must be completed by Dec. 16, 2026.

El Calvario United Methodist Church located in downtown Las Cruces will receive more than $383,000 from the grant to expand space they are currently leasing for the El Calvario Commercial Kitchen Incubator. Rev. George Miller, executive director of the Gastro Emprende Food Hub at El Calvario, told Source New Mexico that the food hub will be available for people who own a business in the food industry or want to start one, but need an area to prepare food.
Miller said the church has a commercial kitchen they used to serve food to people when they were supporting a short-term shelter. The church later opened the kitchen to people with credentials or are trying to work toward them to use, but the space is limited. 
“It kind of came out of our own experience, history of serving food to people,” Miller said. “And some of the clients we deal with are underserved populations, basically, or people without so much access or voice or [who are] discriminated [against]… That was just the people that were at our doorstep here in Las Cruces.”
The program has provided people in the area a place to foster their own businesses, enhance their skills and experiment with food products while also ensuring more New Mexico produced food is used, prepared and distributed.
Miller described it as an “economic development model,” and said current clients use the space to process chile, freeze dry food and develop new products. Plans are nearly complete on the new space, Miller said, and added that he expects the renovation could be completed within six months.
Other grant awardees include Corrales Classic Farms, Santa Fe Farmers Market and La Mesa Organic Farms in Dixon. According to the agriculture department’s release, La Mesa Organic Farms intends to upgrade a mobile kitchen and various processing equipment to increase heritage apple cider and blue corn product production, “expanding into more regional farmers markets while preserving traditional New Mexico foodways.”
“By investing in the middle of the supply chain, we’re helping New Mexico producers bring more local food to market and strengthening our state’s food system,” New Mexico Secretary of Agriculture Jeff Witte said in a statement.
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said in a statement that investing in such programs and projects will “ensure” food produced and processed in New Mexico remains in the state.
“Supporting our farmers, ranchers and food entrepreneurs is an investment in our economy, and in healthier communities and stronger connections between New Mexicans and the food grown here at home,” Lujan Grisham said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/foodsupply-1024x751.jpg,,,2025-11-30 18:57:24.552461

Athletic director Keith Carter said Golding would guide the sixth-ranked Rebels (11-1) “into the College Football Playoff,” which will release its 12-team bracket on Dec. 7. The announcement followed days of negotiations with Kiffin, who chose LSU over staying in Oxford.
“Coach Kiffin and I met yesterday, and he informed us that he is accepting the head coaching position at another school,” Carter said. “For our program to begin preparing for its future – both the short and long term, he will be stepping away from the team immediately.” 
Golding, a former Ole Miss player and longtime defensive specialist, acknowledged the challenge.
“Oxford is home, and it’s an incredible honor to lead one of the nation’s premier programs, and I can’t wait to get to work immediately and prepare this team to win a national championship,” Golding said. “Our mission moving forward is clear: we will play with toughness, discipline and relentless effort in everything we do.

Today, dozens of new docks are available for kids to share that same thrill, thanks to funding Smith helped create. 
South Dakota’s Habitat Stamp fee has become a cornerstone in the state’s strategy to improve wildlife habitat and expand public access for outdoor recreation since the stamp’s inception five years ago.
“It’s a small price to pay for the critters that were here long before we were,” Smith said.

The stamp is a required extra purchase of $10 for state residents and $25 for non-residents when buying a hunting, trapping or fishing license. It was instituted by the state Legislature and sponsored by Smith, of Brookings, who described it as “an insurance policy for the future” of the state’s outdoor heritage. 
Every dollar of the stamp is required by law to go toward wildlife habitat and public access projects. The stamp has raised $21.6 million in its first five years, and the state Department of Game, Fish and Parks has so far spent $14 million on about 1,300 projects. The money is divided roughly equally between water and land-based efforts.
The water projects have included rehabilitating aging dams, constructing and improving boat ramps and fishing piers, dredging and aerating lakes, and restoring habitats such as rock reefs and stream banks. 
On land, the department focuses on seeding native grasses and wildflowers, planting trees and shrubs, improving access roads and trails, and supporting programs that compensate private landowners who open their land to public recreation.
The stamp’s origins
After watching fellow lawmakers debate a one-time, $1 million transfer to a habitat fund in 2019, Smith said he and others saw the need for a permanent, self-funded solution. Surrounding states already had habitat and conservation fees tied to license sales. 
The next year, the stamp bill passed with bipartisan support. 
“The legislation would never have passed without the endorsement of the outdoor groups,” Smith said.
Smith said one of the key players was the Brookings area chapter of the South Dakota Wildlife Federation, including chapter member and retired state waterfowl biologist Spencer Vaa, who inspired Smith to introduce the bill. 
“He enlightened me on the needs of wildlife and the importance of habitat,” Smith said. “A lot of people deserve credit for this. You need a lot of people to get stuff done.”

Jeff Olson, of the Black Hills Sportsmen Club and Black Hills Flyfishers, said some hunters and anglers were initially skeptical of the stamp, and worried it might become “just another tax.” But five years later, he said the results speak for themselves.
Olson pointed to Pactola Reservoir, a popular man-made lake in the Black Hills, and the stamp-funded work local anglers and the department have been doing to add fish habitat structures and improve shoreline access below the reservoir. He said the projects help to make Rapid Creek, which feeds the lake and runs through Rapid City, a prime fishing spot. 
“We wouldn’t have been able to do a lot of the recent fisheries projects we’ve gotten done, like the one below Pactola Reservoir, without those stamp dollars,” Olson said.
Insurance policy for the future
Retired wildlife biologist George Vandel, who now lobbies in Pierre on behalf of the South Dakota Wildlife Federation, called the stamp “one of the smartest investments hunters and anglers have ever made.” 
Vandel said the fee pays for habitat and access improvements that would be “nearly impossible” to secure through South Dakota’s Legislature, where “it’s a fight” to secure funding. 
Nevertheless, a few concerns remain. Vandel mentioned an exemption that allows shooting‐preserve customers to avoid paying the fee. Those are privately owned and managed lands where pen-raised game birds (and sometimes other animals) are released to be shot by customers. He said that was a compromise made during the bill’s passage, with preserves arguing they do not impact wildlife numbers. Vandel wants to apply the fee to preserves and bring in more revenue for Habitat Stamp projects.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Some western South Dakota hunters and anglers, including Olson, say investments have been more concentrated in the eastern part of the state. Of the $14 million spent so far, $4.5 million was spent in western counties. 
Regardless, for outdoor enthusiasts, the narrative is clear: The annual fee provides a tangible return. As Vandel puts it, “The $10 you spend is half a box of shells or a six pack of beer. This is a direct return on your investment. There’s no administrative overhead, it’s just money on the ground.”
Vandel praised the stamp’s results, from new boat ramps and shoreline access to grassland and food-plot restoration. He also pointed to the public access programs as essential to maintaining hunting opportunities. 
“Sportsmen and women have to realize you get what you pay for, and if you want cheap, that’s exactly what you’ll end up with: less habitat, less access, and fewer game,” Vandel said. 
 



 Where the money goes

South Dakota’s Habitat Stamp has funded about 1,300 projects since the program began five years ago:

33.6 miles of new trails.
41 dams repaired.
3,000 acres of forest and grassland habitat enhancements.
41 fish-habitat structures built.
956 wildlife food plots created.
36 new docks and piers.
49 new boat ramps and launches.
5,000 acres of native prairie restored.
14.8 miles of wildlife-friendly fencing installed.

Kevin Harris for the District 27 Senate seat, giving him a three-county sweep, David Trone may be looking into a run for his old House seat against Rep. April McClain Delaney, plus appointments in political notes.","Del. Kevin Harris (D-Charles and Prince George's) during a committee hearing in 2023, his first year in office. Harris won the nomination over the weekend to fill the District 27 Senate seat vacated recently by Michael Jackson. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)The Calvert County Democratic Central Committee voted Saturday to endorse Del. Kevin Harris (D-Charles and Prince George’s) for the vacant District 27 Senate seat, giving Harris a sweep of all three counties in the district.
The final vote, according to Calvert Central Committee Chair Cindy Yoe, was seven votes for Harris and three votes for Jason Fowler, an attorney who ran unsuccessfully for the District 27C House seat in 2018.
The Calvert County vote follows Democrats in Charles County, who went 9-1 for Harris over Fowler last Saturday, and Prince George’s County Democrats, where the 26 central committee members present at Tuesday’s meeting cast 16 votes for Harris and 10 for Del. Jeffrie Long Jr. (D-Prince George’s and Calvert).
The Senate seat covers three House subdistricts that sprawl over the three counties: District 27A, currently held by Harris, includes parts of Charles and Prince George’s counties; District 27B, held by Long, includes parts of Prince George’s and Calvert counties; and District 27C, held by Republican Del. Mark Fisher, is all central Calvert County. All three counties had to weigh in on a nominee, which will be forwarded to the governor.
For those keeping score at home, Harris got 32 votes from the three counties to 10 for Long and four for Fowler. But the important number is 3-0: In an Oct. 21 letter, the attorney general’s office said that each county gets one vote in the selection of a nominee, and Harris got all three. The same letter said that if the counties were split, the majority would still win and only one name would be sent to the governor, so Harris essentially had the nomination sewed up on Tuesday.
The nomination now goes to Gov. Wes Moore (D), who has two weeks to officially appoint him to the Senate seat that was held by Democrat Michael Jackson until Nov. 11, when Jackson — a former Prince George’s County sheriff — took over as the new superintendent of the Maryland State Police.
Assuming Harris’ nomination is endorsed by Moore, the Democratic central committees in Charles and Prince George’s counties will have to meet again to nominate a replacement for the District 27A seat Harris, a first-term member of the House, is leaving behind. They’re on a tight schedule if they want a delegate seated in time for the Jan. 14 start of the 2026 legislative session.
Delaney to Trone to McClain Delaney to … Trone?

The only problem is incumbent Democratic Rep. April McClain Delaney has already announced her reelection bid and started lining up endorsements.
Attempts to reach Trone were unsuccessful. But Inside Elections’ Jacob Rubashkin first reported last week that there was a poll circulating in the district asking people how they would vote in a Democratic primary between Trone and McClain Delaney.
The 23-question poll obtained by Rubashkin asks boilerplate questions about registration and political leanings. It also asks how “appealing” the poll-taker finds McClain Delaney, after describing her as a representative who is “showing up everywhere to fight for hard-working Maryland families,” and Trone, after describing him as a congressman who “stood up against [President Donald] Trump’s abuses of power, voting to impeach him twice.”
But the poll rely leans into it in a series of questions that claim McClain Delaney has voted with Trump more often than any other Democrat in the Maryland delegation and questioning her votes on immigration and criminal justice reform, among others. A follow-up series of questions paint Trone as a relentless defender of Obamacare and abortion rights, and an opponent of Trump during his time in Congress.
McClain Delaney’s campaign responded with a statement noting that her reelection has already been endorsed by every Democrat in the state’s congressional delegation as well as “the Governor, the Lt Governor, the Attorney General … and she looks forward to continuing to fight for the progress needed by Maryland’s Sixth District at this critical moment.”
She has also racked up other endorsements, as well, from unions, environmental and reproductive rights groups, and political organizations like EMILYs List and the New Dems Action Fund, among others.

Tiernan Donohue, the chief campaigns officer for EMILYs List, noted in a statement that Trone, who founded Total Wine and More, spent $60 million of his own fortune in a failed 2024 Democratic primary bid against current Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.). She defended McClain Delaney’s record and said that, “Should Trone decide to run in 2026, Marylanders are going to once again reject his attempt to buy his way back into Congress.”
Should Trone run against McClain Delaney, it would pit two millionaire candidates against one another. In addition to Trone spending heavily on his own race in 2024, McClain Delaney loaned almost $3.9 million to her campaign last year, and has already loaned her campaign $400,000 this year, according to her latest Federal Election Commission filing. That report showed that McClain Delaney had $591,000 in cash on hand as of Sept. 30.
New faces at Governor’s Office for Children
The Governor’s Office for Children has tapped a former federal government official and a longtime worker in nonprofit organizations for key leadership roles in the office.
Special Secretary Carmen Martin said last week that Eric Morrisette will join the office as deputy secretary and Ojeda Hall-France will serve as executive director of the ENOUGH Initiative.
“Eric and Ojeda’s unparalleled experience serving families and communities will be vital to the state’s work in this critical moment,” Martin said in a statement announcing the appointments. “With experience championing transformational policy initiatives, building public-private partnerships, and creating positive change at the intersections between communities and government, Eric and Ojeda are proven leaders to meet this moment.”
Morrisette is the former acting under secretary at the U.S. Department of Commerce, where he led the Minority Business Development Agency, and where he previously served as chief of staff to the deputy secretary and deputy assistant secretary for legislative and intergovernmental affairs. He also worked in the U.S. House and Senate, and served in both analysis and operations at the CIA, according to Martin’s statement.
It said Morrisette will oversee the office’s policy priorities, including managing cross-agency initiatives to support children and boost economic mobility.

She most recently served as executive director of the Child First Authority, which supports 12 community Schools and eight out-of-school-time programs in Baltimore City, according to the statement, which praised her “rich background in community organizing, systems‑change leadership, and nonprofit management.” Hall-France has also been president of the One Love Foundation and spent more than a decade as a community organizer with the Industrial Areas Foundation (IAF), the statement said.
Farlow named to Worcester District Court
Worcester County Assistant State’s Attorney Michael “Mike” Farlow has been appointed to a seat on the county’s district court, Gov. Wes Moore announced last week.
“Mike Farlow is a dedicated public servant whose career as a prosecutor and private attorney has prepared him well for the bench,” Moore’s statement said. “His commitment to the people of Worcester County, both in the courtroom and through his extensive community service, is a testament to the integrity and fairness he will bring to the district court. We are proud to see him serve in this new role.”
Farlow has been a prosecutor for the past seven years. Before that he was in private practice in Ocean Pines, where his practice concentrated on major traffic offenses, criminal law, asset forfeiture law, and wills and trusts, the governor’s office said. He also worked part-time as a prosecutor for the state’s attorney from 2003 to 2010.
Farlow, who ran unsuccessfully for state’s attorney in 2014, was the youngest elected official in Maryland when he was elected a Pittsville town commissioner at age 19. He has been recognized for his work with the Snow Hill Volunteer Fire Department and the Pittsville Volunteer Fire Department, and was recently inducted into the Maryland State Firemen’s Association Hall of Fame, according to the governor’s office.

The moment became one of the most important events in the Civil Rights movement of the mid-20th Century.
At the Henry Ford Museum of American Innovation, visitors can see the real bus where Rosa Parks made her historic decision. Museum leaders say the free admission day is a chance for families, students, and community members to learn more about her life and to think about how one person’s courage can spark big change. 
They hope people use the day to remember her strength, her kindness, and her lasting impact on both Montgomery and Detroit.

On December 1, 1955, Parks, a Black woman, was arrested after she refused to give up her seat to a white man. Her courage helped to start the Montgomery Bus Boycott, which became an important event in the Civil Rights movement. People across the country saw how unfair the bus rules were and began speaking out for equal rights.
Even though many people know Parks for what happened in Alabama, she also has a strong and important connection to Detroit. She moved to Detroit in 1957 and lived there for more than 40 years until her death in 2005.
David Hecker: Students should be taught the truth about Rosa Parks and other civil rights leaders

Former Gov. Jennifer M. Granholm on October 25, 2005, issued the following statement on the passing of Parks: 
“As the mother of the modern day civil rights movement, Rosa Parks will serve as a role model for generations to come,” Granholm said. “She embodied the courage that is so important to the world we live in.  Her quiet strength, dignity and persistence in the face of racial inequality and persecution were an inspiration to all Americans, regardless of race or gender.  We are proud that she adopted Michigan as her home, a place she loved as much as we will always love her.”
In Detroit, she kept working for justice. Parks worked for Congressman John Conyers, a Democrat, and helped people in the community every day. She supported youth groups, spoke out against poverty, and stood up against unfair housing rules and police violence.

Many Detroiters remember her not only as a national hero, but as someone who cared deeply about local families and young people.
In Detroit, several places honor her legacy. A U.S. Post Office is named after her, and the Transit Center in downtown Detroit also carries her name. These landmarks help people remember how Rosa Parks worked for fairness and equality throughout her life.

It is not just about technology; it’s about meeting people where they are and supporting them in ways that make sense for their lives. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Roz King: From libraries to lifelines, how Vermont reinvents rural health care.","This commentary is by Roz King, M.S.N., R.N., of South Burlington. She serves as the chief of research for the department of emergency medicine at the Larner College of Medicine. She is a clinical translational scientist whose work focuses on improving access to care and health outcomes in rural and underserved communities.


For families in Vermont’s rural towns, getting to a medical provider or clinic can be challenging. Long drives, limited transportation and busy work schedules often mean that health care takes a back seat, until a routine health need becomes something more serious.
As a clinical translational scientist and emergency medicine nurse, I see how these barriers affect people every day, and how creative, community-rooted solutions can make a lasting difference.  
Navigating state-level hospital oversight and evolving federal requirements can be complex and, at times, frustrating, but it also creates opportunities for new ways of delivering care. Emergency medicine thrives on thinking fast and adapting under pressure. It is this same mindset that is well-suited to addressing Vermont’s rural health care needs.
Across Vermont, we are finding ways to deliver care beyond the four walls of our institutions, through libraries, mobile clinics and interprofessional student-community partnerships. Sometimes the toughest constraints spark the most impactful ideas.
One example of this community-centered innovation is VITAL VT (Virtual Integration for Telehealth Access through Libraries in Vermont) funded by the Leahy Institute for Rural Partnerships. In many rural towns, broadband gaps, unreliable internet, and discomfort with digital tools can make virtual care hard to access. VITAL VT responds by turning local libraries into telehealth hubs, giving residents a familiar, trusted place to connect with health care providers.
For some families this can mean the difference between delaying care and getting timely support. Consider a parent juggling work and three kids, living 45 minutes away from the nearest clinic. A telehealth visit from a local library can mean timely care and fewer missed days of work or school, and provide peace of mind.
It is not just about technology; it’s about meeting people where they are and supporting them in ways that make sense for their lives. 
What makes projects like VITAL VT powerful is the partnership they create between communities, health care providers and students. University of Vermont students gain hands-on experience while helping their neighbors and libraries become central players in local health care efforts.
These efforts also strengthen the regional workforce pipeline: students are exposed to rural practice environments and gain practical experience in community-centered care, while counties benefit from the fresh energy and innovative ideas that student teams bring. This model not only improves access today but encourages the next generation of health care professionals to consider careers in rural Vermont. 
Another example of Vermont’s innovative approach to rural health care is our mobile obstetric simulation program (supported by a UVM health safety and value grant, and a UVM Frymoyer grant). With the recent trend of obstetric units closing in rural areas, more emergency departments are finding themselves on the front line of maternity care, managing labor and delivery scenarios traditionally considered outside their usual scope.
This shift leaves providers with fewer opportunities to practice complex deliveries and neonatal emergencies in a controlled setting. By bringing high-fidelity simulations directly to community emergency departments, clinical teams can rehearse rare but critical scenarios, building confidence and readiness for moments when every second counts.
These trainings have already reached more than 100 health care professionals across the state, helping teams manage emergencies such as preterm births and postpartum hemorrhage. Programs like this demonstrate how Vermont’s health care system can respond creatively to gaps in access while strengthening local teams and improving patient outcomes.
National Rural Health Day doesn’t just remind us that rural health care challenges are part of everyday life here in Vermont, it highlights the new approaches that become possible when communities, providers, and students work together. From telehealth in local libraries, to hands-on obstetric simulations, Vermont’s small towns are full of innovation, collaboration and resilience.
By investing in community-centered programs and supporting local health care infrastructure, we can strengthen health care access for every Vermonter, regardless of geography. Every local initiative, every community partnership, and every effort to connect patients with care is a step toward a rural health care system that works for everyone.

The genuine beauty of dreams
Maelyn Slavik, 15, Burlington
Our world is filled with such
delicate things, such
beautiful little lights we
find glittering in our eyes and
try to tuck
into pages of torn-out notebook paper that we
fold into our pockets and the creases
of our palms.
There’s a boy in my grade who
plays the piano so beautifully, whose
fingers dance across the keys, and
you can tell each careful note flows
with the dreams of his heart and as
a labor of love, one
that flows so smoothly, even though
he probably stumbled at first.
It doesn’t sound like it, though, as
he plays a song, so sweetly, for
a group of girls to dance to, the
sparkling wings of their act fanned out
around their shoulders, slow and
graceful and
absolutely beautiful.
In our show is another boy, an
actor and singer whose accent
makes his words all the prettier, and
who once told us all to thank
one another
for the kindness that lingers
all around us; he
smiles so genuinely, and
you can see his dreams as they shimmer
all around him.
Those dreams (of
the piano and the firefly wings, and
of the boy who carries stars
everywhere he goes)
are ones I’ll fold over and over and
over into tissue paper whose creases
mirror the ones on my palms.

,Mississippi Today,2025-11-30 12:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Could demise of special projects bill make it harder for Speaker White to pass school choice?,Bobby Harrison,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/11/30/speaker-white-special-projects-school-choice/,Legislative leaders often hold the hammer of special projects to get votes for their key proposals like school choice. But what happens if there is no hammer?,"At some point during the quickly approaching 2026 session of the Mississippi Legislature, House Speaker Jason White will meet behind closed doors with his two-thirds Republican supermajority and ask those members to vote for some form of school choice legislation to provide public funds to private schools while requiring little to no accountability and oversight.
It is the modus operandi of White to meet on the public’s business, including expending public funds, behind closed doors before taking pivotal issues to the full House for debate and a final public vote.
But in the 2026 legislative session, which begins in early January, White could be meeting behind closed doors without the hammer he has previously possessed.
The leadership of the Legislature has long held the hammer over members’ political heads of the so-called special projects bill that is routinely one of the last items passed at the end of each session. The bill provides funds – often totaling in the hundreds of millions of dollars – to pay for projects back home. 
Members who buck the leadership on key votes run the risk of not having their town’s main street repaved or lights placed on their local baseball field. Such projects are routinely funded via a single line tucked in a bill totaling hundreds of pages where scores of other similar local projects are included. The projects bill is normally closely overseen by House Ways and Means Chairman Trey Lamar, who is one of White’s closest allies.
It is normal to see members, with eyes squinting, perusing the massive bill, looking for their project as the legislation is unveiled during the final hours of the session. 
It is important to understand that for many legislators – especially House members – that special project is more important than phasing out one-third of the state revenue stream as they did with a big tax cut in the 2025 session or sending public funds to private schools with no accountability mechanism as is being proposed in 2026.
But the process of passing the tax cut last year might have changed the dynamic. The fight over reducing the revenue stream over time by one-third was so contentious between the House and Senate that the special projects bill did not pass. It got caught up in the battle.
After arguing all session about the tax cut, which eventually passed in a flawed form, the Senate refused to take up a special projects bill. After such a large cut, Senate leaders said the state could not afford to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on special projects.
So, it is possible, maybe likely, that some House members who opposed the landmark tax cut legislation voted for it, anyway, with the understanding they would get a special project.
They didn’t, though.
Could that occur again in the 2026 session as a result of a heated debate over whether to spend public funds on private schools?
Would the Senate leadership have the gumption to eschew a special projects bill again? After all, senators like special projects, too.
And would rural House members in areas of the state where there are no private schools of any note vote to take public funds that could be going to their local district and send their taxpayers’ money to a private school in some metropolitan area that their students have no way of attending?
This session, those issues might be debated. The initial discussion, though, will be in a closed-door meeting of the two-thirds Republican supermajority of the Mississippi House.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/25172713/House-Education-Freedom-Select-Committee-7.jpg,,,2025-11-30 08:01:23.878575

Led by five local founders, Partizanfilm aims to become a social hub for moviegoers while offering a varied movie lineup.

A new art house movie theater, Partizanfilm, is set to open in Burlington next week, filling the gap left by the closure of the Roxy Cinema last year.
The cinema, on 230 College St., will open to members on Dec. 3, and to the broader public the following day, with food and screenings of two movies from the 1970s, “The Last Picture Show” and “Kings of the Road.”
The movie theater has two intimate auditoriums — with 31 and 19 seats, respectively — and a lobby with a cafe-bookstore.
“I kind of couldn’t imagine living in a place without a movie theater,” said Brett Yates, president of Partizanfilm and one of the nonprofit’s five board members. 
Yates said the Roxy was the only commercial movie theater in Burlington, and when it closed last year, he was hoping someone would open a new movie theater. Once it became evident that no one would, he decided to step in.
“I talked with some friends and with my wife, and we thought, well, maybe we could be the ones who do something about it,” Yates said. 
So the five Burlingtonians started looking for spaces for sale to create the movie theater and bought the current property last May.

Now, after months of renovation and with the help of volunteers and members, the space is ready for the upcoming opening.
The cinema will be open seven days a week and offer a mix of commercial movies, independent and foreign films, and old movies. Movies in the evening cost $12, with cheaper tickets during the day. Members have a $2.50 discount on any ticket.
Some of the first movies on the schedule include “Angel’s Egg,” “Henry Fonda for President,” and “Eternity,” with later screenings featuring titles such as “Marty Supreme,” starring Timothée Chalamet, and “The Secret Agent,” which won the best director and best actor prizes at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival.
“We’re not business people. We’ve never started a nonprofit corporation before,” Yates said. “But I think we’ve been, overall, very fortunate. It has kind of all come together.”

Yates said the board wanted to create a social hub where people could gather and talk about films, not just a movie theater.
His wife, Michelle Sagalchik, who is also a board member, said the plan is for people to get involved in the cooperative project and potentially run to become board members when current board members finish their terms.
“We want Partizanfilm to belong to the community. We want the community to take ownership of it,” Yates said. 
Partizanfilm already has about 390 members, according to Yates.
“We — the founding board — don’t want to run it forever,” he said. “We’re creating a cultural institution that we hope we can pass on to everybody.”

A stray comment from a local dollhouse club has snowballed into nearly every downtown storefront aiming to shrink a challenging economic climate with an inaugural Festival of Miniatures.

BRATTLEBORO — Melany Kahn was hosting a local dollhouse club last spring when she first eyed the 3-foot-tall model Victorian “painted lady” in need of a facelift.
“I didn’t see its warts,” Kahn recalled of torn clapboards and tarnished copper. “I just saw its possibilities.”
As a half-dozen club members repaired and restored the aging micro-manse, a stray comment about displaying it downtown snowballed into something bigger.

“Wouldn’t it be amazing,” Kahn remembered hearing, “if every store had one in its window?’”
Cue the inaugural Festival of Miniatures, set to debut this December with nearly 90 dollhouses, dioramas and toy trains — even a working “Mouse Metro” escalator — on display through a partnership with the Downtown Brattleboro Alliance. 
Local merchants spent much of 2024 battling headlines about business closures, bank consolidations and boosted police presence. Festival organizers, aiming to change the narrative, hope thinking small will pay off big.
“Small is cute and sweet and whimsical and charming — and also accessible and affordable,” Kahn said in an interview. “The idea is not to just stand outside and look, it’s an invitation in.”

That’s why the Shoe Tree now features handknit animals nestled in literal shoebox apartments. Why Morning Glorious Vintage has dolls in retro couture. Why Mitchell Giddings Fine Arts has the newly restored model Victorian filled with 100 locally crafted small-scale furnishings.
“Most artists went above and beyond,” said Kahn, pointing to tiny touches fashioned by area potters, weavers and glassblowers.
The festival, running through December, will officially launch during the town’s first-Friday-of-the-month Gallery Walk. Alongside storefronts, the Brattleboro Museum and Art Center will host toy trains, the Latchis Gallery will feature a “Museum of Things Tiny and Found” and the Boys & Girls Club will offer a Dec. 20 display of “Spirit Houses” decorated by 13 area schools.
Organizers won’t say if the festival will return until they record and review public response.
“There are metrics we can measure,” Kahn said of spectator and sales figures.
There’s also the small stuff not easily seen.
“Shopkeepers are working very, very hard to make our downtown thrive, and that’s what has kept me so invested and involved,” Kahn said. “To me, supporting this feels really good, really important.”
And, amid so many miniatures, really big.

This story by John Lippman was first published in Valley News on Nov. 26, 2025.
A Bradford man faces a potential prison sentence and nearly $500,000 in restitution payments for taking payments for van conversions for which he failed to perform the work.
Matthew Strong ran the now-shuttered business called East Coast Van Builds on Route 5 in Bradford’s Lower Plain. He advertised as a specialist in customized camper vans. He also has worked as a music promoter and is known for organizing reggae events in the state.
Strong has agreed to plead guilty to a charge of wire fraud after admitting that he took van customer payments and diverted some of the money to his entertainment business, according to a plea deal entered in federal court in Burlington on Nov. 18.
Strong required customers to pay an initial $10,000 non-refundable down payment and then 50% toward the remaining balance of their job — typically $30,000 or more — but failed to deliver the work as promised and dodged calls and emails from irate customers inquiring about the status of their vehicles, the court documents said.
East Coast Van Builds operated from 2021 through at least the end of 2024 and specialized in converting Ford Transit and Mercedes vans into customized camper vehicles with kitchen, bathroom and bedding facilities, according to court documents.
Customers said Strong would prevaricate when it became apparent the work had not been done, or ghost them altogether, according to court documents and interviews with customers. An attorney listed in court documents as representing Strong did not respond to an email request for comment on Tuesday. An email to an address listed for Strong also received no response.
A private Facebook group called Survivors of East Coast Van Builds, which was created in March as a place for former customers “to commiserate, share resources, legal advice, ideas, rage, and heal,” now has 37 members.
Many of the accounts shared in the group echo that of Charlie Allen.
Allen, a retired software developer from Wilmington, Delaware, said he and his wife had purchased a new Ford Transit 350 HD van for $65,000 in 2022 which was delivered that May to Strong in Bradford to convert into a camper. The cost of the job would be $120,000, and Allen said he paid half upfront.
Then began the runaround, Allen said.
“I’d call him up and ask what’s going on,” Allen, 71, told the Valley News. “He’d say, ‘Oh, I’m having trouble getting parts’, or ‘So-and-so ‘is sick’. Then the summer wore on and it’s August and he says, ‘A month. You’re third in line’. Then there’d be another month.”
Eventually, Allen became fed up with the excuses and said he drove seven hours from his home in Delaware to Bradford in February 2023 — nine months after Strong took possession of the van — to see for himself what the problem was. What Allen said he found was that only the windows, roof vents and a fan had been installed, only a fraction of the work.
“He’d done zip,” said Allen, who abandoned all hope and drove off with his van.
He said he does not expect to recover the $60,000 he paid to Strong despite the restitution required under his plea agreement. He noted that when he and his wife found another company to complete the conversion, the windows that Strong installed had to be replaced because they leaked.
“We got nothing. All we got was lies,” Allen said.
According to court documents, Strong took photographs of work-in-progress inside one customer’s van and sent them to the customer of another van claiming the images were evidence of work-in-progress on the van the second customer had demanded to see.
In another instance, Strong used money customers paid for van conversions to cover expenses for a music festival he produced in Topsham in 2022, prosecutors said. He used one customer’s van without permission at the Topsham festival, which the customer was able to detect through tracking software.
Strong, through his company Rooted Entertainment Solutions, organized the Green Mountain Reggae Festival at the Bradford Fairgrounds last year and the Green Mountain Smoke Out festivals in Topsham in 2023 and 2024.
Strong was stringing along at least 10 van customers from seven states, the court documents state. He has agreed to forfeit a total of $477,502 in payments, according to the plea agreement.
A court date has not yet been scheduled for Strong to formally enter his guilty plea on a single felony count of wire fraud. A conviction on the charge is punishable by up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine or twice the gross gain or loss, whichever is greater.
Even customers who were able to get their van conversions completed by Strong said it was an ordeal. Michelle Robbins said she had to literally show up on the day she was told work would be done and wouldn’t leave until it was completed.
“We were actually one of the ‘lucky’ ones. … We did end up getting a build-out but only after showing up at the shop multiple times demanding answers,” Robbins said via text. “We straight up accused (Strong) of felony fraud because he had $60K of our cash and nothing to show for it,” she said. “At that point we gave a firm deadline … We knew there was no money and knew we had to push for a build rather than try to get money back.”
“We let him know it was up to him whether we got the police involved,” Robbins wrote. “Once we accused him of fraud, he magically found time to work on the van and get it almost complete — with many issues because they rushed.”
Getting his van converted into a van was a much rougher ride for Tim Weaver, however. Weaver, of Carrabassett Valley, Maine, said he forked over $60,000 to have Strong convert a van he purchased at the Lebanon Ford dealership in 2023 and contracted with him in April of that year to begin work.
Weaver had very specific instructions about how the van was to be fitted out with special equipment because his wife, Carol Weaver, is an adaptive athlete who is a paralyzed from the chest down as the result of a mountain biking accident three years ago. The couple’s goal was to have a vehicle that could transport Carol Weaver’s $25,000 mountain bike securely while also providing room for Tim Weaver, also a software engineer, to work remotely.
A specially fitted-out camper van, like the one Tim Weaver had seen on YouTube of a paralyzed former Canadian female Olympic athlete using to “drive around Canada,” would be the ideal solution for them. At first Strong seemed enthusiastic about taking on the van conversion project, even contacting the Canadian woman in the YouTube video.
“That to us said all the right things. We jumped right in,” said Tim Weaver, admitting sheepishly, “we didn’t do a lot of due diligence after that.”
So in April 2023, the Weavers signed a contract and sent Strong the initial $10,000 down payment and soon followed that with another $50,000 for “materials cost” [sic]. They also spent $67,000 to buy a Ford Transit Extended High Roof.
“Less than two weeks after I wired the big $50K (to Strong) it was radio silence,” Weaver said. Months passed before Weaver said he could finally get Strong on the phone again. “I was a little upset,” Weaver said.
He recalled telling Strong, “I get you may not be jumping on my van because you got other things going on, but I send you 50 grand and you ignore me? You just take my money?” Weaver said “that was the point we should have bailed. But we had already invested so there was no way out.”
In April 2024, 12 months after they had signed the contract and paid Strong $60,000 Weaver said he delivered the van to Strong’s shop in Bradford. Inquiries about how things were progressing were fruitless. The few times he could get Strong to respond, “he said they ‘started it, we’re working on it’. There was always some weird excuse, like ‘my dad’s house burned down’,” Weaver said.
Although he demanded photographs as proof of progress, Weaver said none were ever sent.
“The van sat with them from April 2024 until we got a call from the Vermont AG’s office saying, ‘You need to come get your van,’ which was April 2025, basically 12 months,” Weaver said.
He traveled from Maine, and when he got there and tried to start the engine, it wouldn’t turn over. A rear brake light was smashed. The only conversion work that had been done was some mounting strips to which interior paneling was to be attached — but was so poorly done it had to be stripped out. “Basically, after two years, all I had was flooring,” Weaver said.
With the help of jumper cables, Weaver got the van to start and he drove it back to the dealership in Lebanon, which in a couple weeks did the necessary repairs. He then brought it to home Maine where Weaver, now retired and with ample time on his hands, embarked on a DIY project to convert the van into a camper himself.
Weaver wrapped up the project a couple months ago, and on Dec. 5, he and Carol are driving the camper to Breckenridge, Colorado, where Carol will participate in the Hartford Ski Spectacular, a week-long program ski and snowboarding adaptive program.
“That will be our first big trip,” Weaver said.

(Photo by Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)  Linda McLain reached the end of her two-year sentence at the Louisiana Correctional Institute for Women in July, but it would be another month before she could leave. It took those 30 extra days for her to find a residential facility that met the terms of her supervised release.  
Her wait time is an indication of the state’s shortage of transitional living space, group homes where the recently incarcerated can ease their way back into society. The supervised settings offer reliable shelter while residents seek employment and meet what are often rigorous terms of release, including drug testing and court appearances.   
McLain, 55, was placed at A New Way of Life, a residential reentry center in New Orleans. She was imprisoned in 2023 for a string of drug and property crimes in Jefferson Parish, describing them as poor decisions attributed to a substance addiction. She was sentenced to a diversion program that kept her isolated from the main prison population to focus on her recovery and job-training skills.

But even with that special treatment and an extra month behind bars, McLain acknowledged she was not ready to be out on her own. 
“If you are protecting us so hard and keeping us from the elements in prison, now who’s going to protect me when I get out?” McLain said in an early September interview. 
As of mid-November, she was still living at A New Way of Life and training for a promotion at the restaurant where she works. 
There’s no precise picture of how many formerly incarcerated people require reentry services in Louisiana. Residential reentry programs are supervised at the district court level, so there is no cumulative number available from state corrections officials on how many people live in such settings. 
Incarceration data sheds some light on the need. Louisiana has consistently led the nation in per capita prison population, with more than 1,000 out of every 100,000 residents imprisoned as of 2024 according to the Prison Policy Initiative.
As of Sept. 30, there were nearly 30,000 people in state custody according to the latest numbers from the Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections. Almost 45,000 more are under state supervision, with the large majority on probation.
Instead of running its own halfway houses, the state contracts with nonprofit residential reentry service providers, who operate 36 housing sites in 17 parishes. 










The work we do not only improves the quality of life for our clients, but it's improving public safety for the community.


– Andrew Hundley, The Parole Project co-founder


The Parole Project, a Baton Rouge-based organization, is the largest of these nonprofits. It owns 11 properties for people transitioning from prison to residential supervision and another 33 residences for individuals who’ve completed their obligation to the state but still need its structure and support service. These homes, too, have been at maximum capacity all year. 
“I estimate that we’re only able to accommodate half of the people in prisons who reach out to us, asking us for reentry services and housing support when they leave,” said Andrew Hundley, Parole Project co-founder and executive director. 
Hundley was the first “juvenile lifer” in Louisiana to be paroled in 2016 when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled life sentences without parole for child offenders were unconstitutional. He was imprisoned at age 15 for the second-degree murder of 14-year-old Terri Pitre in Acadia Parish in 1997. Hundley’s sentence was commuted to time served when he was 36, and he helped launch the Parole Project within months of his release. 
Initially, he and the other formerly incarcerated individuals in his organization saw themselves as mentors to others who would be freed under the ruling. They would help them open bank accounts, get their drivers’ licenses and teach them to use cellphones, which didn’t exist when many of them were first sentenced.      
“Where we were off the mark was housing because there’s the assumption that people are going to go home to their families,” Hundley said. “That missed on people who’ve been in prison so long they’ve outlived their families … Sometimes you don’t want to go back to the community where you caused harm because you want a place to start fresh.”
Hundley said there are no plans for the Parole Project to expand beyond its Baton Rouge footprint, though its services are available to anyone regardless of where they’re from in Louisiana if they don’t want to go back home after exiting prison. Housing prices are a primary obstacle to adding transitional living space in New Orleans, Hundley said.

There are also no plans on the horizon for the state to put more money into what its corrections department calls emergency and transitional housing, according to Nicole George, coordinator of the state’s Justice Reinvestment Initiative. 
“We’re always interested in improving as [the Division of Parole and Probation] sees the need for us to reevaluate certain things,” George said. 
When it was started in 2015, Louisiana’s Justice Reinvestment Initiative sought to save money on corrections with a focus on placing violent, serious offenders in prison. The resulting prison population drop allowed those resources to be directed toward reentry and other programs to reduce recidivism.     
Former Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, championed the initiative over his two terms in office. His successor, Republican Gov. Jeff Landry, has emphasized longer prison sentences for more offenders and fewer opportunities for parole through his first two years in office. His administration has directed significant dollars toward upgrading and building juvenile correctional facilities.    
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The need for transitional living space in New Orleans was evident soon after A New Way of Life cut the ribbon on a two-story house in the Hollygrove neighborhood. It’s been at or near its capacity of 16 residents since first opening its doors in January.
The Los Angeles-based nonprofit has similar sites in 12 states and two African countries for women who have exited prison. Founder Susan Burton came to New Orleans in January for its grand opening. She launched the organization in 1998 after being incarcerated for a total of 20 years for crimes related to her drug addiction.  
Based on Burton’s post-prison experience and needs, A New Way of Life provides much more than shelter. Its staff connects formerly incarcerated women with jobs and logistical assistance to keep them. There’s also mental health support, both formal and informal, including counseling for a number of residents who are recovering from addiction and substance abuse.
“Having places like this benefits all of us,” Jefferson Parish Judge June Berry Darensburg, who oversees its drug court, said in an interview. Defendants who appear before her can be diverted from hard prison time if they are good candidates for in-custody rehabilitation and work skills training. They’re also required to secure a spot in a reentry facility such as A New Way of Life. 
The impact of transitional residential services has caught the attention of state Rep. Debbie Villio, R-Metairie, a former Jefferson Parish prosecutor known for tough-on-crime legislation. She declined an interview but confirmed last month that she’s working with the state corrections department, the Parole Project and other groups on legislation in support of reentry services. 
The state provides up to $20 per day per formerly incarcerated person for six months of transitional housing. This money doesn’t cover the Parole Project’s expenses, Hundley said. He explained the organization doesn’t manage its properties as a money-making operation, with rental rates deliberately kept below market rate for its post-transitional housing to keep those tenants on the path to self-sufficiency. 
Hundley is banking on philanthropy to ensure the Parole Project can continue its mission, noting that any reduction in state funding could force belt-tightening. 
“The work we do not only improves the quality of life for our clients, but it’s improving public safety for the community,” Hundley said.

‘You’re going to have rules’
Structure is part of living at A New Way of Life, a residential home in New Orleans for the formerly incarcerated where the staff ensures residents show up on time for work, court dates, drug screenings, counseling and any other appointments deemed necessary. 
The women who live here are also expected to take part in daily group discussions at 8 a.m.. They’re also responsible for household chores and must adhere to a 10 p.m. curfew.  
“That structure is there to help them understand that everywhere you’re going to go, there’s going to be rules. Even if you’re out on your own and have your own apartment, your own house, you’re going to have rules,” said Dante Butler, the New Orleans home’s director of housing services. “Getting them used to that societal structure is a plus for them, and once they get out there it won’t be such a huge shocker.”
Butler handles most of the residents’ logistics. He’s also an attorney who accompanies some of the women to their court appearances, helping to build a solid reputation for the new reentry home.
Linda McLain is among the 16 residents at the home. She was released from prison in July after serving a two-year sentence for drug and property crimes in Jefferson Parish, where a judge placed her in a diversion program that’s contingent upon her following the rules of A New Way of Life.
Within days of settling in at the group home, McLain started a job on the overnight shift at a nearby 24-hour restaurant. It was the only time slot that didn’t conflict with her daytime court obligations. 
Even with all of the court-ordered and self-imposed restrictions she faces, McLain still keeps an eye toward the future. Her ultimate goal is to start her own business, putting to use the horticultural and pest control certificates she earned while in prison. She wants to employ other formerly incarcerated women who need the same hand up she’s received. 
“I’m 55 years old. I cannot keep going in that same path. Where am I going? Nowhere,” McLain said in an early September interview. “For me, I just want to live the next half of my life successfully.” 
McLain is still coming to terms with how her criminal past led her family to “washing their hands” of her, calling it her lowest moment. She’s not to reunite with those relatives yet.
“They like to remind me that, ‘You know you’re where you’re at because of the mistakes you made,’” McLain said. “I know that I don’t need you constantly reminding me.” 
As of mid-November, McLain was still living at A New Way of Life. Butler said she continues to progress in her recovery and is now being trained in different positions at the restaurant with plans to become a manager.
Trenice Lawson, 50, lived in the group home for six months and found her own place nearby in August that she shares with her son. She was released from prison in 2023 after serving 25 years for attacking a security guard at a hospital while under the influence of drugs. Lawson said it was the culmination of a criminal history driven by her addiction.
“My lifestyle before I went to prison was basically the street life, the drugs, the hustling,” she said. “I shoplifted to support my habit.”
Her first transitional living site after prison didn’t offer the structure Lawson said she needed, and living with her brother in the River Parishes meant she had few opportunities to find work. But after moving into A New Way of Life earlier this year, she landed a full-time job with a tour bus company and picks up shifts with the Superdome event staff during football games. Lawson credits the group home’s nurturing environment with helping her confront trauma from her childhood and begin the healing process.
One of the key components of group home life Lawson and McLain both mentioned is the shared experience and insight of the other women under the same roof,  
“Any given point if, if one of us is having a bad day, we can look at each other and go, ‘What’s going on? Talk to me. Let’s go talk about it,’” McLain said. “And there’s absolutely no judgment going on. We know we’ve been there.

Then James Wayman, a chef who was conducting his own soy experiments, got involved.","An occasional look at Connecticut’s remarkable people, places and things Credit: ct mirror
In 2018, Bob Florence tapped out a message on Instagram. Would James Wayman, then head chef of Mystic’s Oyster Club, try the soy sauce that Florence had been brewing in barrels in his basement? 
Florence didn’t know that Wayman was already conducting his own nascent experiments with koji on the second floor of Oyster Club. Koji, a mold that transforms soybeans into soy sauce and rice into miso, has been a tool in Asian cooking for millennia, but Wayman was just beginning to explore how it might be deployed in his kitchen, from fermenting charcuterie to baking bread. 
“Koji has been the single biggest game changer in the food I’ve made over the years,” said Wayman, sitting at a picnic table on a sunny October day outside of his cafe, Nana’s, in Mystic. When koji is used to inoculate beans and grains, it releases sugar from starch and amino acids from protein. Those flavors — of sweetness and umami — linger on the palate. Together they play a chord of flavor, Wayman says, rather than a single note. 
“Some of the most amazing foods in the world don’t do that. An incredible peach is so amazingly delicious, but you eat it, you have the flavor sensation, and it’s gone, right? Koji has the ability to draw that out and make it bounce around all of your taste buds.”

Koji was also the critical ingredient transforming soy beans into the soy sauce in Florence’s basement in Mystic — a slow-motion Maillard reaction, the same chemical process that occurs when proteins and sugars are heated and rendered delicious. Think: the sear on a steak, or the caramel notes in the crust of a baguette. 
When Florence took on soy sauce making, he was moving on from a long career that combined manufacturing with chemistry. Early in his career, he lived in Detroit and sold industrial plastics to the automotive industry, back when manufacturers were replacing clunky metal parts with plastic to lighten vehicles and improve mileage. Later, Florence worked in electronics manufacturing. Both industries brought him frequently to Japan and China, where he became a disciple of local cuisine. 
Florence eventually used his training as a chemist to pivot from plastics to renewable energy, working with a startup that turned algae into oil. The science worked, but the business wasn’t profitable. By then, Florence was living in Mystic with his wife, children’s book author Debbi Michiko Florence. After selling off the equipment to the algae fermentation company, Florence started casting about for a new idea. He embarked on what seemed, at first, to be a hobby: brewing soy sauce at home. 
“If you go to a grocery store in Japan, there might be a selection of like 20 different soy sauces, whereas in America you might have one or two or three,” Florence said. Often made by small family companies, local Japanese soy sauces, or shoyu, were “beautiful” to Florence. They were thick, opaque, umami-rich, and they enhanced food more deeply than the mass produced translucent varieties on U.S. shelves.
“My question was, how are they made? And can they be made here? And can I make them?” 

Patiently, Florence waited. His koji-inoculated soy beans and wheat turned into soy sauce. He worked up the courage to ask Wayman to try it. Immediately, Wayman asked to put it on the menu at Oyster Club — written into the ingredient list as “Bob Florence Soy Sauce.”

“I was sort of tapping the brakes on being commercial. I was just looking for feedback,” Florence said. “But the next thing I know, he put it on the menu.” 
Wayman could immediately tell that someone who cared about food was making the soy sauce. 
“It was almost like an extension of him, in a way. His food felt like Bob,” Wayman recalled. The soy sauce and the human being who created it both possessed “a quietness, a softness almost, but an intensity and intellect.”

But even after that milestone, Florence continued to tinker. He sought advice from experts, sending a letter to 15 CEOs of Japanese soy sauce companies.  
“My letter to them was really simple. It was, ‘Hi, I’m Bob. I make soy sauce in America, and I’m coming to Japan. Would you mind spending a few minutes talking to me about soy sauce?’” 
Three CEO’s responded. “They were kind and gentle,” Florence said. They let him know his soy sauce was “OK.” Good enough to keep going. Of those CEO’s, Kyosuke Iida, president of Chiba Shoyu, became his mentor. 
Florence, his wife Debbi, and Wayman invested in scaling up the business together, a brand they would call Moromi, which refers to the mash of ingredients put in a barrel to brew what will eventually be pressed and become soy sauce. They searched for a space to expand production and, just before the COVID pandemic hit, found a former batting cage in North Stonington, complete with AstroTurf, and transformed it into a soy sauce brewery. Today, Florence says that Moromi is one of just a handful of U.S.-made soy sauce brands.
Debbi, a third-generation Japanese American, has also written children’s books that play on the theme of cooking, like a picture-book biography of Michelin-starred Chef Niki Nakayama. 
Over the years, Wayman has brought his perspective as a chef to the venture, convincing Florence to experiment. Many of these renditions highlight a single additional ingredient, like maitake mushrooms, sugar kelp, or rye, to create new flavor profiles. Florence would be happy, he says, just making a single version of Moromi, but the experiments have played a part in attracting chefs from across the country to bring Moromi to the tables of their restaurants, to more than 200 shops, and even to Connecticut for visits to the Moromi brewery in North Stonington where they sign their names to the “chef’s wall of culinary creativity.”
Wayman is no longer affiliated with Oyster Club, but at his Nana’s locations in Westerly, R.I., and Mystic, Moromi and koji can be found all over the menu. There are miso glazed sourdough donuts, made to order. Pizza sauce with koji (“it makes a tomato taste more tomatoey,” Wayman says). Koji porridge sourdough bread. Even daily specials like a poke bowl highlight Moromi, with a splash of sugar kelp shoyu. 
“It’s easy, if you know how to cook already, to integrate into your food,” Wayman said.

Even ice cream shop Mystic Drawbridge has gotten in on the fun, crafting their Sweet ‘n Salty Shoyu scoop with a touch of vanilla — cooking Moromi with sugar results in a deep, salty caramel that is at once simple and decadent. 
These days, Florence runs the day-to-day of the business. He gets up early, has a cup of coffee around 4:30 a.m., goes over orders and makes shipments. Perhaps he presses a batch of soy sauce, or inoculates a batch of soy beans which sit in a sauna-like room, paneled with cedar planks. Florence has just one assistant on staff, and though Moromi is carried in stores across the U.S., the operation is small enough that they can handle the volume. Moromi isn’t carried by big box stores, which Florence says is a conscious choice in a business that’s defined by patience. 
“It’s like anti-fast. Everything is slow. The fermentation. The pressing,” he said. “There’s nothing rushed.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MOROMI-SOYSAUCE-1001-DE-202-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-30 05:56:11.582771

(Photo by Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)The trouble started one wet Friday morning in late October when Jarom Smith walked past a weathered red gate in a brushy area near the southwest corner of the Emporia city limits. Smith, a citizen journalist, wanted a couple of photos of the old police shooting range inside to post for his readers.
“I simply walked around the gate,” Smith recalls. “I didn’t open anything. I didn’t climb anything. I didn’t have to.”
Smith says he didn’t notice a sign saying the area is for law enforcement only.
We’re standing on the dirt lane outside the open gate, two days before Thanksgiving. As we speak, Smith is being investigated for criminal trespass and authorities have obtained a search warrant for the Facebook account of his digital newspaper, the Lyon County Observer. It seeks “all records” from three days in October.
There are no officers inside practicing, no sharp reports cracking the November air, just a few city workers. They appear to be moving dirt or preparing to. There’s a bulldozer idling on the shoulder of the road behind us. We’re a few hundred yards away from the city transfer station, which before the days of recycling and waste management would be called the city dump.
There’s a “Dead End” sign near the red gate to the shooting range, but the warning sign is behind us and to one side of a low-water bridge maybe 25 yards away. I don’t spot it myself until Smith points a finger at it.
Suddenly the bulldozer comes roaring up behind us and passes close as it goes through the gate. A few minutes later, the transfer station supervisor comes up in a white city truck. The supervisor, a guy named Tim in a dark ball cap and a safety-green shirt, is visibly irritated.
He says the area is posted. I say we’re on public property.
“We’ve already run this guy off twice,” the supervisor says, indicating Smith with a tilt of his head.
Then he steps on the gas and briskly enters the off-limits area.
On Oct. 24, Smith posted the images of the range to the Observer’s Facebook account and then forgot about them. He was surprised when he got a phone call from an investigator with the Emporia Police Department a couple of weeks later saying he was investigating a criminal trespass complaint at the joint city-county shooting range.
“He asked me if I had stepped onto it,” Smith recalls. “I told him I took two photographs and left, and that I didn’t notice any ‘No Trespassing’ sign. He said there was.”
On Nov. 16, he was notified by Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, that the company had received a search warrant for the Observer’s account. When Smith said he didn’t know what the warrant could be about, Meta sent him a copy of the warrant. On its “Information for Law Enforcement” page, the company says it may be compelled, upon receipt of a warrant showing probable cause, to disclose “the stored contents of any account, which may include messages, photos, videos, timeline posts, and location information.” While friends and family chats are now end-to-end encrypted, according to Meta, Smith said he doesn’t believe the same protection applies to business chats.
Signed Nov. 14 by a Lyon County judge, the warrant did not identify the crime being investigated, but it said evidence had been given under oath to find probable cause that an offense had been committed. The warrant sought “all records” for the account from Oct. 23 to Oct. 25.
Meta said Smith had 10 days in which to challenge the warrant or it would release the information. Smith didn’t know what to do. He was afraid he might go to jail through an honest mistake, and he worried about the hundreds of readers who had sent him news tips and other confidential information through the Observer’s account. How could he protect his sources if the police had access to all that information?
It might, Smith feared, be the end of the Observer, a digital upstart on a shoestring budget.
Smith, 41, posts nearly every day. He covers government meetings, publishes crime reports and runs interviews with candidates for local elections. He lives in Olpe, about 14 miles south of Emporia. The Observer has 5,000 followers, and Smith gives them the news with a twist. He’s not afraid to voice his opinion, and that has made him a polarizing figure in this struggling college town of 24,000.
“I really want to see Emporia become a bigger town,” he said, “a stronger town and a more free town. And everything I’m doing is towards that goal.”
Smith defines “more free” as being more transparent, and he believes spending millions on a new shooting range and emergency dispatch center are symptoms of government obfuscation. In one post, he accused a county official of lying about the true cost of the project.
“I don’t think I’m going to stop it from being built,” Smith said, “but it’s time that people speak out and not be afraid.”
It’s a troubling thing for democracy when any news outlet receives a search warrant, and alarming when the warrant is a clear abuse of power. In 2023, the Marion County Record made international news when its newsroom, and the home of its publisher, were targets of a police raid looking for evidence of a nonexistent crime. Authorities improperly seized computers, cellphones, and records. The stress of the raid may have contributed to the death of 98-year-old Joan Meyer, co-owner of the newspaper. The Marion raid, the most brazen example of a challenge to press freedom in recent American memory, has resulted in lawsuits being settled with the paper’s management, its reporters and others in the millions of dollars.
Reporters exercising their First Amendment right to gather news are supposed to be protected by an array of state and federal laws.
“The federal Privacy Protection Act of 1980 sharply limits whether law enforcement can use search warrants against journalists,” David Greene, a senior staff attorney and civil liberties director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told me. “The search warrant (in the Lyon County Observer) case would seem to be so overly broad that it would violate the PPA.”
Greene’s foundation is a San Francisco nonprofit devoted to protecting digital privacy, defending free speech, and promoting internet civil liberties. He said he didn’t think the Kansas Reporter’s Shield Law applied in this case, because the warrant sought material from Meta and not the journalist. While subpoenas for information are fairly common, Greene said, search warrants are less so.
“What the Privacy Protection Act is really saying is use a subpoena,” he said.
A subpoena allows a challenge before authorities can seize documents and equipment. There are exceptions, of course, such as when national security is at risk or a person’s life is in danger. It also does not give journalists carte blanche to commit crimes, although it is unlikely that mistakenly setting foot on a prohibited property would be worth more than a warning in most jurisdictions.
Greene pointed out that the act actually doesn’t identify “journalists” in its language but instead defines the protected material as that gathered with the intent to disseminate to the public.
“Everyone who has social media or uses online services (to reach the public) is covered,” Greene said. “So that doesn’t require someone to be a professional journalist.”
Smith said he considers himself a journalist, although many in the community don’t. Reporters from some legacy media outlets will move across the room to be away from him when he covers meetings. Some officials have taken issue with the accuracy of his reporting, and Smith acknowledges that he is still learning but tries to correct any mistakes quickly.
Smith is a largely self-taught journalist. He graduated from Emporia State University with a BA in political science in 2018, but makes his living as a contractor painting homes and businesses. He spends 10 to 15 hours a week gathering news, maintaining the Facebook account and updating the Observer’s dedicated platform called ShareThere. He says the Observer doesn’t yet make any money, and that his income from the contracting business subsidizes the digital publishing venture. He doesn’t have a fancy camera, so he relies on his phone for just about everything, and he often excuses himself to take a call. It’s important, he said, that he answers when the phone buzzes.
Hundreds of people have contacted him through the Observer’s Facebook account with confidential news tips and other information. In the past 90 days alone, he said, after checking his phone, he’s had 141 conversations with readers.
“Sometimes it’s just people saying hey, I like what you wrote,” Smith said. “Sometimes it’s somebody saying, ‘I’ve got a story for you.’ In the past couple of days I’ve had people who want to meet with me. I don’t write about every story that people ask me to, but I guess I’ve become known to cover things that others don’t.”
He files Kansas Open Records Act requests, attends lots of meetings, and asks many questions. Name an entity in Lyon County — the city commission, county officials, the local hospital — and they have likely been stung by Smith’s opinion. Local officials often find him irksome, some told me confidentially, but others said they had a growing respect for his plainspoken tenacity. His pieces aren’t as polished as those of veteran reporters, but he is building a dedicated audience through aggressive reporting and sharp point of view.
“Emporia’s economy has taken hit after hit — Tyson gone, Holiday Resort closed, Morgan Advanced Materials shuttered — yet the Regional Development Association continues drifting without leadership, purpose, or result,” he wrote in one recent post.
In another:
“On Tuesday, three new (city) commissioners were elected, backed by the same circle of old-money power brokers that have steered this town for decades.”
And, back in April 2025, this commentary about the county’s purchase of land to build a new law enforcement shooting range and 911 communications center at a cost of $2 million:
“For what purpose was this tract of land bought?” Smith asked. “A shooting range. Not a public one for you and me, but for the sheriff’s department. Never mind the fact that they already have one about 300 yards away from the new site. Never mind the fact that there is an additional one a few miles north of town off of the turnpike.”
The price of the project, according to local reports, has now risen to more than $5 million. At least $1 million — including a $250,000 federal grant — has already been approved for the gun range. I emailed Lyon County Commission Chair Ken Duft for comment on the project and Smith’s criticism. Duft did not respond to the request.
While I seldom agree with Smith because our politics are so different — until recently he called the Observer the Lyon County Conservative — I find him an easy man to talk to, somebody who appears sincere in his beliefs. When he sits for an interview, he is freshly showered and wearing clean clothes but still has paint — a dark, institutional brown — from the day’s contracting job clinging to his hands.
When some readers complained that he called out others for misbehavior but was ignoring his own past, he posted his own mugshot from years ago, when he was booked for a misdemeanor. Smith said the offense was later expunged. In 2020 and 2024, he ran unsuccessfully in the Republican primary for county commissioner, coming in third both times.
Like others with connections to legacy media, I was irritated at how Smith began his digital newspaper. It’s not the way I would have done it, I tsk-tsked to myself. But now I realize that is the point of the Observer, because it’s a publication made not for me but for a different audience. It’s an alternative. And anybody who says he’s not gaining needed journalism skills isn’t paying attention.
But the quality of Smith’s reporting is not a factor when it comes to the search warrant. What does matter is the chilling effect on free speech that occurs when investigators seek warrants to access the social media accounts of those who inform the public.
That Smith was the target of a search warrant from officials who should have known better, especially since the Marion raid, is inexcusable. A literal misstep should not be subject to the full force of investigative discovery. What did investigators hope to gain from the Observer’s social media account? Smith had already shared with them the photos he took and admitted to straying into an area where he didn’t have permission. And the county prosecutor, according to Smith, said she hadn’t even seen the search warrant until it was posted on the Observer’s Facebook account.
Since Nov. 25, Smith has been represented by Max Kautsch, a Lawrence attorney specializing in media law who has also contributed columns to Kansas Reflector. Kautsch declined comment. Smith, however, told me a second, narrower search warrant was in the works for the Observer’s account.
I contacted the county prosecutor, Amy Aranda, and asked her about the case. What crime was being investigated? What local code or state statute did investigators suspect of being broken? What did the second search warrant hope to uncover?
“I cannot comment on an ongoing criminal investigation,” Aranda told me in an email, “except to state it is my understanding that a search warrant was withdrawn, no records were produced, and a second search warrant will not be served relating to the matter you’re inquiring about.”
When I described the email to Greene, the Electronic Frontier Foundation lawyer, he chuckled.
“Well good for them,” he said. “They did the right thing.”

If you’re one of the 82 million Americans who traveled at least 50 miles for Thanksgiving, perhaps some of you opted for Amtrak instead of driving. Our nation’s passenger railroad estimates a 6% boost in ridership this year, as Amtrak’s growth and popularity continues.


Not that taking the train is cheap: A one-way, last-minute fare from Stamford to Washington, D.C. on Thanksgiving day was as much as $400 on one train! It’s a matter of demand exceeding supply. Still, Amtrak is proud of these fares which, nationwide have seen the railroad increase overall revenues by 10%.
Aside from worsening highway traffic and delays, why chose the train instead of driving? Because the investment in its infrastructure is finally paying off with better service.
Stations are being improved, crucial bridges (like the Walk Bridge in South Norwalk) are being reconstructed, new tunnels are being built, tracks and overhead power lines replaced. You can see the improvements as you travel.
And then there’s the new equipment.
Amtrak’s long expected (and four years delayed) NextGen Acela is turning eyes as it whooshes up and down the corridor. It’s a really sweet train, with only five sets in service so far but with 23 more sets to come by 2027. But these sleek new trains are having problems, especially between New Haven and Providence, one of the ‘curviest’ parts of the Northeast.
Fast trains abhor curves. While the new Acela can go as fast as 160 mph, it can do so only on about 40 super-straight miles of its 450-mile journey from Washington to Boston. In the rest of Connecticut it can go no faster than Metro-North.
In fact, the new Acela is slower than the old Acela, especially from New Haven to Providence. The reason? Tilting, or lack thereof.
To handle all the curves in Connecticut, Acela is designed to automatically tilt into the curves, maintaining speed without having passengers’ beverages sliding off their tray-tables into their laps.
But because the NextGen Acela is still awaiting final certification by the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), it’s limited in how much it can tilt into curves. That means that, between Providence and New Haven, the new Acela takes ten minutes longer than the older models, worsening those supposedly-faster trains’ on-time performance.
Because our tracks in Connecticut are older and placed closer to together than in other parts of the corridor, the tight clearances between passing trains could cause a problem… especially if two passing trains should both be tilting in the wrong direction and sideswipe each other.
As the NextGen Acelas prove their reliability and improvements are made to our tracks, it’s expected that the Federal Railroad Administration will lift some restrictions and all the new trains will ultimately operate at maximum efficiency.
With more and faster trains, the increase in available seats may lead to lower fares. But what Amtrak really needs is competition… the topic for another story.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/NexGen-Acela-3-AMTRAK.jpg,,,2025-11-30 04:56:39.813851

Sarah Beckstrom, who had graduated from the school just two years prior.
“Sarah was the kind of student teachers hoped for,” said Webster County High School Principal Gabriel Markle, who taught Beckstrom when she was a student. “She carried herself with quiet strength, a contagious smile and a positive energy that lifted people around her.” 
Beckstrom, 20, died on Nov. 27 after a targeted attack in Washington, D.C., where she was serving with the National Guard. 
“Her commitment to service, both in our school and in our nation’s military, spoke volumes about her character,” Markle said.

Webster Springs is a small town, and dozens of people in attendance Saturday evening knew Beckstrom or her family members. 
They described Beckstrom as a peacekeeper, someone who was quick to help and who often stepped up to serve. She had dreams of becoming an FBI agent, prompting her to join the National Guard. She was part of a Military Police company.
“It’s a terrible thing that happened, but I’m glad that she was the person that’s in the spotlight and is representing not only West Virginia, but our county,” said Amy Jones, 25, who knows Beckstrom’s family. 
Gov. Patrick Morrisey attended the candlelight vigil, telling the crowd that justice would be served in Beckstrom’s death. 
“She loved her state, she loved her country, and she wanted to serve,” the governor said. “It’s hard to sit here and not be angry at what happened to Sarah.”
The suspected gunman, 29-year-old Afghan refugee Rahmanullah Lakanwal, will face a first-degree murder charge along with other charges after shooting two National Guard members, including Beckstrom.
The other victim, U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, remains hospitalized in critical condition. Wolfe is also from West Virginia.

The Webster Springs community held three vigils for Beckstrom following her death.
“The loss of Sarah Beckstrom in such a tragic and senseless manner has been devastating for all that knew her and loved her,” said Sen. Robbie Morris, R-Randolph. “The grief is palpable everywhere you go. The vigils have been filled with tears and broken hearts. My prayers continue to go out to her family, friends and fellow Guardsmen.”
On Saturday evening, the crowd prayed and sang the hymn, “Amazing Grace,” before lighting candles. Many in attendance wore blue ribbons to honor Beckstrom; wreaths in the same shade of blue hung around town in the miles winding to the high school. 
The high school’s Junior ROTC members presented the colors. 
“I feel like it was a worthy homage to her, and it’s good knowing that you know we have the resolve to get through this as West Virginians, as a whole state, rather than a single county,” said Junior ROTC member Liam Versmessen, 17, who attended high school with Beckstrom. 
Funeral details for Beckstrom haven’t been released. 
Morrisey said that Wolfe and Beckstrom were friends while serving in the Guard. The pair were patrolling near a Metro station blocks from the White House at the time of the shooting.
“We pray to lift up Andrew, who is continuing to fight,” Morrisey said. 
Morrisey originally sent about 300 members of the state’s National Guard to D.C. in August, at the request of the Trump administration for “Operation D.C. Safe and Beautiful.”
About 150 members of the West Virginia National Guard are still in D.C., and have been deployed there on a voluntary basis since about Nov. 15.
In the wake of the attack on the National Guard members, President Donald Trump announced he intends to “permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries,” though he didn’t specify which countries would be included.

(Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)LINCOLN — Nebraska state agencies are partnering with Lexington nonprofits and other groups to help connect Tyson Foods workers and their families with support as 3,200 people lose their jobs with the closure of the town’s longtime beef plant.
On Wednesday and Thursday, a state and local “rapid response layoff services” event is scheduled for Tyson workers at the Dawson County Fairgrounds, according to a statement Saturday from Gov. Jim Pillen’s office.
Representatives of the Nebraska Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, Economic Development and Agriculture will offer information about available resources, including unemployment insurance benefits, job search help and economic support programs, the statement said.
Tyson is to convey timing for the event to workers.
“This holiday season will look different for these families, but we know that Nebraskans show up for each other,” Pillen said. “We are seeing that happen in Lexington.”
State hunts way forward after Nebraska got ‘butts kicked’ by Tyson plant closure

Tyson on Nov. 21 announced it is closing the longtime Lexington beef plant, eliminating jobs around Jan. 20. The company also is laying off about 1,700 workers at its plant in Amarillo, Texas.
Tyson’s announcement of the closures did not specifically address why it targeted the Lexington plant over other facilities. A recent earnings report indicated the processing giant stands to lose $600 million in its beef business next fiscal year, on top of the already-incurred $720 million loss over the last two years.
Pillen has said a factor was the age and efficiency of the plant, which originally was constructed around 1973 to manufacture combines and other farm machinery. It was converted and opened as a meatpacking facility in 1990.
State labor officials said workers should file an unemployment claim when their employment ends, not before. Individuals who quit their jobs due to an upcoming layoff are generally not eligible for unemployment benefits, the statement said. The state Department of Labor says it will provide reemployment services to impacted workers. Inquiries can be emailed to ndol.rapidresponse@nebraska.gov.
State Labor Commissioner Katie Thurber said Nebraska employers also are coming together for job fairs. Details are to be announced soon.

In addition to state agency efforts, the Lexington Community Foundation is distributing information about local organizations providing and accepting assistance to support workers. People can visit givebiglexington.org for more information.
Pillen has said he did not learn of the Tyson decision until around noon on Nov. 21, the afternoon Tyson released a public statement on the closure. The governor told the Examiner that the “good news” is that Tyson officials are exploring other options for the Lexington plant property, including repurposing it into a specialty, “value-added” agricultural operation.
Tyson did not respond to a reporter seeking comment on that possibility. 
“This is a difficult time for the community and the impacted workers, but they have truly come together to help make DOL’s efforts possible,” Thurber said in the Saturday statement about the outreach session. “An event of this size would not be happening this quickly without community support.”

Here are instructions on how to look up your new Property Tax Bill on the New Castle County website.
New property tax bills are being sent to all New Castle County property owners this week.  If you haven’t received yours – or wish to dig a little deeper and understand the changes that have occurred for your – here are instructions to into your record on the New Castle County website.  This is best accomplished using a desktop, laptop or tablet computer.  It is possible to do on a smart phone, but requires a bit of finesse with the smaller screen.  For the easiest experience, you could print out this article and have it for reference, as you navigate to your information.
First, go to the New Castle County “Parcel Search” screen.  Use this link or use your browser search engine to navigate there (enter “New Castle County Parcel Search”).
https://www3.newcastlede.gov/parcel/search/
Once on the screen, below, it is usually easiest and most successful to enter the absolute minimum information.  I recommend “Street Number”, “Street Name” (use “contains” and the primary word, no direction), and the “City” (Wilmington, Newark, Middletown, etc…).  Select “Search.”
 
Step one. Enter your address.
 
The screen should display your record and, perhaps, others that fit the broad search terms your entered.  Simply click on the line for your property.  That will take you to the detailed screen for your property.  Once there, you will see the property description and your current assessed value.  This value has been updated by the reassessment process and reflects your property value as of July 2024, which is the basis for your taxes.  This screen also shows any building and plumbing permits, historically, District & Zoning information (identifying your various state and county representatives and zoning information).  It also shows the “Deed History” for this property.
Step 2. Confirm that this is your home… click on View Tax and Sewer Bills
 
Select “View Tax and Sewer Bills” to see your current (and a dozen or so prior) tax and sewer bills.  Your current Tax Bill should be dated about 11/17/25.  For comparison, you can view last year’s bill, dated about 7/23/24.  There is also the preliminary bill that was issued in July of 2025, before actions were taken to readjust that tax rates for residential versus commercial property owners.  The 11/17/25 bill should be identical to the bill you will receive in the mail, shortly.
Additional details on your property are visible by selecting “Property Characteristics” on this menu.
Step 3… click on Property Characteristics
Your 2025 Property Tax is due by December 31st.  If you have a mortgage and your taxes are paid through escrow, your lender should handle payment.  If your escrow is insufficient to cover a possible increase, they may notify you of the need to make a supplemental contribution to your escrow account and your future mortgage escrow payments may be adjusted for next year.  Contact your lender with questions or concerns about this.  If you do not have a mortgage or pay your property tax separately, then the payment must reach New Castle County before the end of the year to avoid penalties.
Lastly, be aware that some formal appeals are still in process.  If you did not appeal your 2025 property tax bill, you can still seek changes for 2026.  However, the deadline for 2026 appeals to be filed is March, 14, 2026.  If you are a “Senior” (either owner is over 65 years old), there is currently a “Senior School Tax Credit” of $500, but it must be filed by April 30, 2026, if you have not previously filed for this relief.  There is no income restriction on this particular credit, only age is required to qualify.  You only file once for the Senior School Tax Credit, then it continues automatically.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-29-141411.jpg,,,2025-11-29 14:57:47.885935

(Photo by Joshua Haiar/SD Searchlight)South Dakota’s wetlands aren’t just pretty places on a map; they’re our lifeline, filtering drinking water, keeping rivers clean, and soaking up floods before they reach our basements.
But here’s the deal: The EPA just finalized a rule proposal that slashes federal protections for these vital lands, especially those without a “continuous surface connection” to rivers and streams. This rollback isn’t theoretical. It’s real, and it’s happening right now. If we let these rules fade away, we’re risking more than a patch of grass. We’re putting our water, wildlife and future growth on the line.


Comment period open
On Nov. 20, the proposed rule “Updated Definition of ‘Waters of the United States'” published in the Federal Register, triggering a 45-day comment period will that will close on Jan. 5.
Comment portal >


Think about the last heavy rain that flooded our fields or sent muddy water racing through our streets. Without wetlands acting as nature’s sponge, those floods hit harder. This new EPA rule invites more tile drainage and agricultural expansion, meaning less water gets filtered and more pollution goes straight into our streams and lakes, risking algal blooms and drinking water problems.
But the story isn’t just about water. South Dakota’s wetlands are bustling habitats for waterfowl, deer, and the wild things that make our prairie special. Hunters, anglers and birdwatchers feed local businesses and bring millions into our state. Strip away those habitats, and rural economies take a hit. The EPA’s recent move exposes nearly 2 million acres of South Dakota’s wetlands to new risks, and with no strong state-level protection, we could lose even more.
Some say wetland regulations hold us back, but in the long term, that’s just not true. Wetlands save us money on water treatment, protect property values, and attract outdoor recreation and tourism. Communities with strong wetland protections bounce back faster from disasters and keep dollars flowing long after a storm rolls through.
Letting wetland protections vanish under the new EPA rule is a short-sighted bet South Dakota can’t afford. If we want strong towns, thriving farms, and a future for our kids to hunt, fish and enjoy clean water, we need to defend what’s left of our natural infrastructure. This isn’t about red tape, it’s about resilience. Our wetlands make South Dakota stronger. When they lose, we lose.

,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-11-29 17:33:10+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,How a 1940 electoral system reform in Cambridge made its 2025 housing breakthrough possible,Andrew Justus and Alex Armlovich,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/opinion/how-a-1940-electoral-system-reform-in-cambridge-made-its-2025-housing-breakthrough-possible/,This is more than just a housing “win.” It’s a triumph for Cambridge’s unique brand of representative democracy—one that balances citywide priorities with fair representation for diverse communities.,"Last winter, Cambridge quietly accomplished what few cities have dared: through an ambitious zoning reform, it legalized four-story buildings across nearly every neighborhood. The reform is projected to increase the city’s capacity for new homes. 
This is more than just a housing “win.” It’s a triumph for Cambridge’s unique brand of representative democracy—one that balances citywide priorities with fair representation for diverse communities. 
Why did Cambridge succeed where other cities have failed? The answer lies not just in zoning, but in how Cambridge elects its city council.  
When cities shift from all at-large councils to district-based council seats, housing construction falls by 21 percent. This is because district- or ward-based council members are strongly motivated to block new development in their neighborhoods. When every member follows that instinct, the city builds less housing. 
Traditional electoral systems with all at-large seats can so thoroughly suppress minority representation that they violate the Voting Rights Act. Cities then face a dilemma: Either prioritize citywide interests like housing, or ensure fair representation for localized minority groups. Faced with this tradeoff, many housing advocates have steered clear of debates over electoral design altogether. 
Cambridge City Councilor Burhan Azeem, first elected in 2021, campaigned – and won –on a citywide pro-housing platform. When we spoke to Azeem, he said, “In a district-based system, there may not be enough renters in any one district to elect a council member.” In our conversation, he added, “But in an at-large system, renters from across the city can vote for candidates that reflect their priorities.” 
This victory was not accidental, but the product of a skilled political entrepreneur and a growing pro-housing movement, empowered by an electoral system that resolves the tradeoff between citywide needs and minority representation. 
In a city with district-based representation, the political costs and benefits of development are fundamentally misaligned. The backlash to a new apartment building can be concentrated in a local council member’s district. The benefits are often spread across the entire city or region. 
This imbalance creates a legislative norm of deference to the local council member on land-use matters. While the phenomenon has different names in different cities, the outcome is the same: homebuilding stops. 
As then-Mayor Ed Koch warned when New York City adopted this model in 1989, it is a recipe for “land use paralysis.” In such systems, only a powerful, independently elected strong mayor can consistently champion citywide interests against the council’s localized concerns.  
But Cambridge has a city council-city manager form of government, which vests some of the executive power of a strong mayor system with the council, making the council’s electoral system crucial for enabling citywide coalitions.  
Since 1940, Cambridge has elected its city council through an at-large ranked-choice system. Candidates win by reaching a vote threshold—just over 10 percent of ballots—ensuring that any political or demographic group with modest support can earn a seat. 
That guarantee of minority representation without resorting to geographic wards is what allows Cambridge to pursue citywide goals like housing. 
The system does not eliminate geography as a basis for representation—it prevents it from being the sole basis. If voters in a neighborhood want to organize as a bloc, they can band together to elect a representative of their choosing. 
Cambridge’s electoral system doesn’t guarantee pro-housing outcomes. As public opinion shifts, it allows a new consensus to gain power proportionally.  
According to Azeem, the system acts as an “accelerator for enacting the voters’ preferences.” In a traditional winner-take-all system, the pro-housing movement would remain shut out of power until it could command a plurality. In Cambridge, it gained a foothold on the council as soon as support crossed the 10 percent threshold. 
Housing advocates on the city council methodically built a coalition to remove barriers to housing. Their first goal was to eliminate parking minimums – an ambitious first choice and proof of concept for the pro-housing coalition. The coalition then moved to reform affordable housing requirements, making it easier to get units built without onerous affordability requirements. Only after crossing these two hurdles did the pro-housing coalition attempt a broader rezoning of the city. 
As Massachusetts communities grapple with state housing mandates and the legacy of local control, Cambridge offers a powerful lesson: good governance design can make reform politically possible. With an electoral system that balances majority rule and minority rights, cities can build coalitions that deliver both representation and results. 
They can – and should – have both.

When the olive green charter bus pulled into the suburban civic center in a conservative area east of Cincinnati just after 9 p.m. on Friday, the women were ready.
They loaded duffels and coolers and bags of snacks into the bus. They carried handmade “Impeach, Convict, Remove” signs, transgender pride flags, and the red hooded cloaks and white bonnets made famous by “The Handmaid’s Tale,” the dystopian feminist novel adapted into a popular Hulu series.
Cincinnati was the first of three stops in a “turn and burn” trip from Ohio to the nation’s capital for a “Remove the Regime” protest — and it didn’t follow the most logical route. Stops in suburbs outside Columbus and Cleveland added hours to the drive. The women didn’t seem to care.
The passengers piled into the dark bus — a dozen or so in Cincinnati, 14 near Columbus, 20 on the outskirts of Cleveland. Some of the women brought along friends, a few came with their spouses and others traveled on their own. There were brief introductions among seatmates as each new group boarded and everyone settled in; a couple of them built blanket tents to block the cold air that seeped in and the lights from cars passing the bus on the highway.
They would need all the rest they could get. This protest trip would involve two overnight bus trips in 36 hours and just 12 hours on the ground.

For people like Judy Routhier, who boarded in Cleveland, the trip to Washington was the latest in a string of public efforts to oppose the Trump administration. This mother of four married to a military veteran said it was her 72nd protest since February. She brought laminated signs that read, “Hump-y Trump-y Must Fall! He’s on the Epstein List” and “This ‘Piggy’ Won’t be Quiet! IMPEACH. CONVICT. REMOVE.”
Deann Ragsdale, who boarded in Cincinnati, was embarking on her first public action despite her opposition to just about every facet of Republican Donald Trump’s presidency from its start. The longtime labor-and-delivery nurse and mother of three teenagers — one of them transgender — keeps a grueling hospital schedule. The protest happened to fall on a weekend off. “Something has to change, and we have to start somewhere,” she said.
Like at many events opposing Trump and his administration, the majority of the bus passengers were women, though a couple who spoke to The 19th noted that men are increasingly joining them in their local protest efforts. The women said they were spurred into action by the administration’s moves to restrict reproductive rights, its attacks on the rights of LGBTQ+ people, its hostility to immigrants and its disregard for the rule of law.
The “Remove the Regime” event was organized by member organizations of the Removal Coalition, a grassroots effort just like the Ohio bus trip. The trip had come together just days earlier, when a woman from Florida raised more than $30,000 through crowdfunding to “find affordable buses and coordinate seats so that no one is left behind just because they can’t pay for a ticket.” Someone else created a “Get to DC” page on Facebook to connect travelers. There were also local events in places like Charleston, South Carolina, and Fairmont, West Virginia, for those who could not make it to Washington.

When the bus pulled into Union Station, near the Capitol building, just before 9 a.m. on Saturday, Jen Mazzuckelli, who acted as point person for the Cincinnati group, changed into her Handmaid cloak and headed to the Lincoln Memorial. Like many on the bus and at the larger protest, Mazzuckelli is involved with a grassroots political movement known as 50501 — as in 50 protests, 50 states, one movement.
“If somebody says ‘50501,’ you know they’re in the fight, you know they’re in the resistance,”  Mazzuckelli, 52, said. “I feel like we’re in Star Wars.”
Mazzuckelli, a mother of three who extracted herself from an abusive marriage, knows on a personal level how looming Republican cuts to social safety net programs like Medicaid health insurance and SNAP nutrition assistance might impact her exurban Ohio community. After her divorce, she said she relied on Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF, which provided cash assistance for necessities until she started receiving child support. She currently receives disability benefits due to a multiple sclerosis diagnosis. She spends more and more of her time protesting the Trump administration and is weighing another run for office after an unsuccessful bid last year for her county’s GOP-dominated board of commissioners. For now, she tries to be a thorn in their side, showing up to meetings.
As Mazzuckelli and other women dressed like Handmaids sat on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial alongside a massive copy of the U.S. Constitution, she thought to herself: “This will probably end up in history books, if we have real history books … It’s a historical moment, and I’m glad I was able to be a part of it instead of watching it on TV.”
“Remove the Regime” was a three-day action that included lobbying, trainings, an event honoring the military and its veterans, then the rally and a march. There were music performances from the Dropkick Murphys, among others, and a sold-out “Comedy Church” fundraiser with a set from North Carolina’s Cliff Cash, who is known for humor skewering Southern conservatism. Cash was one of the first to join the Removal Coalition, founded by Jessica Denson, a former staffer on Trump’s 2016 campaign who brought a class-action lawsuit over its use of nondisclosure agreements. Rep. Al Green, a Texas progressive, spoke at the rally, as did House of Representatives contender Kat Abughazaleh from Illinois.
The protest events came after a particularly tumultuous week for Trump that highlighted his past treatment of and continued hostile rhetoric directed at women. After months of delay tactics on behalf of GOP leaders, Congress voted on Tuesday to compel the Justice Department to release its files on disgraced financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Trump snapped, “Quiet! Quiet, piggy,” at a female Bloomberg News reporter who asked about releasing the Epstein files aboard Air Force One. But then he reversed course, writing on his social media platform, Truth Social: “I DON’T CARE! All I do care about is that Republicans get BACK ON POINT.”
Epstein references abounded on signs at the rally; Routhier, who was also wearing a fuzzy pig hat, was one of hundreds who had worked Trump’s exchange with the reporter into their protest gear. A woman from Northern Virginia carried a “Quiet, Piggy, lil’ fascist piggy” sign. A woman in a Trump mask with pig ears and a snout held a sign that urged “IMPEACH the Piggy!!” as she stood next to her Air Force veteran husband. At least a half dozen protesters were dressed up as Miss Piggy from The Muppet Show.
It wasn’t the largest event opposing Trump, but it was meaningful for those in attendance.
Amber Curry, a 36-year-old from Georgia, said the president’s treatment of women was a big factor in drawing her to Washington for her first-ever protest. Her husband is a disabled veteran and her family of six relies on programs like SNAP — which disproportionately serves women, children and older and disabled Americans — to feed themselves and make ends meet. Their benefits, disrupted during the record-breaking government shutdown that ended earlier this month, still aren’t back to normal. Curry warned that she might cry when talking about her reasons for attending the protest. “It’s so beautiful, people here are listening, because no one around me listens,” she said.
After the speakers and musical performances wrapped, the Miss Piggies and the inflatable eagles, polar bears, frogs, sharks, foxes and at least one Cookie Monster lined up behind the Handmaids and began to march. When Marine Force One flew directly overhead as Trump returned to the White House from an aerial tour with Jack Nicklaus of a planned golf course near Joint Base Andrews, fists and middle fingers rose into the air.
At the end of the day, the women from Ohio made their way back to Union Station, convening in the basement food court to wait for the bus. They rolled up their signs ahead of the journey back to America’s Heartland. There was a buzz of excitement as they shared their experiences.
Erin Nezi, 45, said she was initially drawn to protest the Trump administration because she “felt a camaraderie with all of these women,” referring to the Handmaids, who had by then changed out of their cloaks. Nezi’s first local protest was in February; in recent weeks, she’d begun making trips to the nation’s capital. She is part of a group of women trying to build a Handmaid “army” in rural and exurban southern Ohio.
Nezi is currently unemployed after spending years on an assembly line building steering wheels for Ford vehicles. Her husband is a fully disabled Navy veteran dependent on benefits from Veterans Affairs. She said she is protesting for him — and also for other women like her, for her LGBTQ+ family members, for immigrants in her community and for her 69-year-old mother, who relies on subsidized housing. A constant question that runs through her mind, she said, is, “When is it going to come for me?”
The women boarded just after 9 p.m. The bus made its way out of Washington, crossed Maryland and Pennsylvania, and then stopped in Cleveland, Columbus and finally Cincinnati as the sun rose over the horizon. They thanked the bus driver, also a woman. She thanked them for going to the protest.
Routhier said her 73rd protest is already planned.
Ragsdale is considering making a video to share about how she assembled her sturdy, reusable sign.
Mazzuckelli wants to pursue “deep organizing” in rural, conservative pockets of Ohio, perhaps in conjunction with the Working Families Party.
“My idea is to get a committed group here in Clermont [County] and start pushing eastward,” she said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/trumpfeb242025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-29 10:57:22.598691

As of November 2025, the U.S. has already recorded 20,939 cases for the year. That’s slightly lower than the 21,391 cases during the same period in 2024, but these numbers are significantly higher than in 2023, when there were 2,993 cases by this time. Texas has issued a health alert on a surge in cases, and rates are rising in other states, too.
Third unvaccinated Kentucky baby dies of whooping cough

Kentucky is in the midst of its largest spike in whooping cough since 2012. The disease has killed three babies in Kentucky over the last 12 months. None of the infants or their mothers had been vaccinated against it, the Kentucky Department of Public Health confirmed.
Like measles, which is also spreading at unprecedented levels, whooping cough, more formally known as pertussis, can be prevented by a safe and effective vaccine. But with anti-vaccine sentiment increasing and cuts to immunization services, vaccination rates for whooping cough over the past two years have declined in children.
The Conversation asked epidemiologist Annette Regan to explain why pertussis has become so prevalent and how families can protect themselves from the disease.
 What is pertussis and why is it dangerous?

Pertussis is a vaccine-preventable disease caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis. Researchers in France first identified the B. pertussis bacterium in 1906. The first recorded epidemic of pertussis is thought to have occurred in Paris in 1578.
Infection can cause an acute respiratory illness characterized by severe and spasmodic coughing spells. The classic symptom of pertussis is a “whoop” sound caused by someone trying to breath during a bad cough. Severe complications of pertussis include slowed or stopped breathing, pneumonia and seizures. The disease is most severe in young babies, although severe cases and deaths can also occur in older children and adults.
Some doctors call pertussis “the 100-day cough” because symptoms can linger for weeks or even months.
The World Health Organization estimates that 24.1 million pertussis cases and 160,700 deaths occur worldwide in children under 5 each year. Pertussis is highly contagious. Upon exposure, 80% of people who have not been previously exposed to the bacterium or vaccinated against the disease will develop an infection.
Fortunately, the disease is largely preventable with a safe and effective vaccine, which was first licensed in the U.S. in 1914.
 How do cases last year and this year compare with past years?

During the COVID-19 pandemic between 2020 and 2022, pertussis cases were lower than usual. This may have been a result of limited social contact due to social distancing, masking, school closures and lockdown measures, which reduced the spread of disease overall.
In the past two years, however, pertussis cases have surpassed figures from before the pandemic. In 2024, local and state public health agencies reported 35,435 pertussis cases to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — a rate five times higher than the 7,063 cases reported in 2023 and nearly double the 18,617 cases reported in 2019 prior to the pandemic.
Between October 2024 and April 2025, at least four people in the U.S. have died of pertussis: two infants, one school-age child and one adult.
 Why are pertussis cases rising?

Although vaccines have resulted in a dramatic decline in pertussis infections in the U.S., incidence of the disease has been rising since the 1990s, except for a brief dip during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Before the start of routine childhood vaccination for pertussis in 1947, its rates hovered between 100,000 and 200,000 cases per year. With vaccines, rates plunged under 50,000 annually by the late 1950s and under 10,000 per year in the late 1960s. They reached a low of 1,010 cases in 1976.
Starting in the 1980s and 1990s, however, the U.S. and several other countries have been seeing a steady resurgence of pertussis cases, which have exceeded 10,000 cases in the U.S. every year from 2003 to 2019. They dropped again during the pandemic until last year’s resurgence.
There is no single explanation for why cases have been rising recently, but several factors probably contribute. First, pertussis naturally occurs in cyclic epidemics, peaking every two to five years. It is possible that the U.S. is headed into one of these peaks after a period of low activity between 2020 and 2022. However, some scientists have noted that the increase in cases is larger than what would be expected during a usual peak.

Some scientists have noted that this apparent resurgence correlates with a change in the type of vaccine used in children. Until the 1990s, the pertussis vaccine contained whole, killed B. pertussis bacteria cells. Whole-cell vaccine can stimulate a long-lasting immune response, but it is also more likely to cause fever and other vaccine reactions in children.
In the 1990s, national vaccine programs began to transition to a vaccine that contains purified components of the bacterial cell but not the whole cell. Some scientists now believe that although this partial-cell vaccine is less likely to cause high fevers in children, it provides protection for a shorter time. Immunity after whole-cell vaccination is thought to last 10-12 years compared with three to five years after the partial-cell vaccine. This means people may become susceptible to infection more quickly after vaccination.
Vaccination rates are also not as high as they should be and have started falling in children since 2020. In the U.S., the percent of kindergartners who are up to date with recommended pertussis vaccines has declined from 95% during the 2019-20 school year to 92% in the 2023-24 school year. Even fewer adolescents receive a booster dose.
 How can people protect themselves and their families

Routine vaccination for children starting in infancy followed by booster doses in adolescents and adults can help keep immunity high.
Public health experts recommend that children receive five doses of the pertussis vaccine. According to the recommendations, they should receive the first three doses at 2, 4 and 6 months of age, then two additional doses at 15 months and 4 years of age, with the aim of providing protection through early adolescence.
Infants younger than 6 weeks are not old enough to get a pertussis vaccine but are at the greatest risk of severe illness from pertussis. Vaccination during pregnancy can offer protection from birth due to antibodies that pass from the mother to the developing fetus. Many countries, including the U.S., now recommend that women receive one dose of pertussis vaccine between the 27th and 36th week of every pregnancy to protect their babies.
To maintain protection against pertussis after childhood, a booster dose of pertussis vaccine is recommended for adolescents at 11 to 12 years of age. The CDC recommends that all adults receive at least one booster dose.

Because immunity declines over time, people who are in contact with infants and other high-risk groups, such as caregivers, parents and grandparents, may benefit from additional booster doses. When feasible, the CDC also recommends a booster dose for adults 65 years and older.
Vaccine safety studies over the past 80 years have proven the pertussis vaccine to be safe. Around 20% to 40% of vaccinated infants experience local reactions, such as pain, redness and swelling at the vaccination site, and 3% to 5% of vaccinated infants experience a low-grade fever. More severe reactions are much less common and occur in fewer than 1% of vaccinated infants.
The vaccine is also highly effective: For the first year after receiving all five doses of the pertussis vaccine, 98% of children are protected from pertussis. Five years after the fifth dose, 65% of vaccinated children remain protected.
Booster vaccination during adolescence protects 74% of teens against pertussis, and booster vaccination during pregnancy protects 91% to 94% of immunized babies against hospitalization due to pertussis.
Families can talk to their regular health care providers about whether a pertussis vaccine is needed for their child, themselves or other family members.

And a former Nebraskan is behind it.
Rising from a dusty, prairie ridge along Interstate 90 near this Badlands-area town is a collection of firetrucks dubbed “Firehenge.”
Its creator, an Omaha Burke High School grad who runs a Rapid City brewery, said the ring of 10-ton firetrucks vertically arranged in a circle is more about promoting his Firehouse Brewery Company than trying to lure away visitors from Alliance, Nebraska’s popular Carhenge, about 200 miles to the south.

The new South Dakota version of the roadside attraction, which sits just off I-90, also includes a collection of buried fire hydrants called “Doghenge.” By next summer, the new henges will include a gift shop where visitors can purchase brewery souvenirs and canned beer and wine from the Firehouse Brewing Co., South Dakota’s first and oldest brewery.
“We are just having a ton of fun out here. Just come out and see it,” said Bob Fuchs, the co-owner of the brewery who graduated from Burke in 1981. And, he adds, bring your dog.
A city official in Alliance, which took over ownership of Carhenge in 2013, said she doesn’t expect local residents to mount a monumental fuss over a competing “henge” in the general vicinity.
“I think all of these things are fun,” said Shana Brown, the director of cultural and leisure services for Alliance.
As it turns out, both Carhenge and Firehenge have plenty of competition in tourism’s Carhenge-replica category.
There’s a “Foamhenge” (made out of foam) in Virginia, a “Truckhenge” near Topeka, Kansas (made out of farm trucks), a “Phonehenge” (made out old telephone booths) in South Carolina, and a “Strawhenge” (made out of bales) in Bavaria, Germany.
Years ago, a “Twinkiehenge” was built during a Burning Man festival in the Nevada desert. There was once a “Snowhenge” in Michigan and a “Fridgehenge” (made out of old refrigerators) once graced the plains near Santa Fe before complaints caused its demise.

A couple decades ago, a reporter was summoned to Chadron, where a suspected “Hayhenge” had been built northeast of town. Round hay bales had been arranged in a circle at a local ranch.
In the kinda-old-henge category, there’s a full-size concrete replica of Stonehenge in Maryhill, Washington, that was built in 1918 to honor people lost in World War I.
And near Carbury, North Dakota, there’s a circle of granite walls that serves as a 21st Century solar calendar, which is the suspected purpose of Stonehenge, a prehistoric circle of stones aligned for ceremonial purposes to indicate the summer and winter solstices, and the spring and fall equinoxes.
Carhenge was built in 1987 by Jim Reinders and his relatives as a memorial to Reinders’ father, who had lived on the farm north of Alliance where the collection of 39 American cars – arranged to align with the solar calendar – now sits.
The off-beat attraction draws about 100,000 visitors a year, according to Brown, and features a staffed gift shop from May through September. An estimated 4,000 people gathered there for the solar eclipse in 2017.

Carhenge has appeared in films, commercials, television shows and in song. Last summer, it hosted a group of muralists, who painted murals on the grey-painted cars, providing a new look for the motorcar monument.
Fuchs, the Firehenge creator, said he’s not haunted by henges but had visited Carhenge shortly after it was first created.
The inspiration for his firetruck circle came during a recent marketing meeting for his brewery, which was established inside a former Rapid City firehouse built in 1915.
Fuchs has long parked old firetrucks, purchased from all corners of the Midwest, next to his brewery billboards to draw more attention to his business. He says that he often hears that visitors to Rapid City’s downtown area ask “where’s the Firehouse?”
“It’s guerilla marketing,” Fuchs said during a recent visit to Firehenge. “It’s very effective.”

At the marketing meeting, one of Fuchs’ aides was playing with a toy firetruck. Once she set it on end, vertically, an idea was born.
He said he has no plans to hoist a firetruck so it sits horizontally across two vertical trucks — like the stones at Stonehenge and cars at Carhenge. Too many liability concerns, Fuchs said. More firetrucks may be planted this spring, though, he said. And a YouTube video, featuring a visit by aliens to Firehenge, is in the works, Fuchs adds.
Over the din of a front-end loader smoothing out a gravel parking lot, he said it’s been a lot of fun.
“I get to explore my artistic side by planting fire trucks in the prairie,” Fuchs said.

Dunnebacke lay still atop a folding table that was dressed as a bed, complaining that her legs hurt. Registered nurse Ana Kanellos, rolling up two small white towels, demonstrated how to elevate her ankles to ease the pain.
“ Mom’s legs are always swollen? Raise ’em up,” Kanellos said.
About 20 New Orleans residents listened intently, eager to learn more about how to care for loved ones at home when they’re nearing the end of their lives. Attendee Alix Vargas said she used to be terrified of dying. But about three years ago, a close cousin’s death led her to attend group writing workshops, helping her embrace her grief and conquer her fear.
“ I’m feeling very called towards this work,” she said. “It’s definitely knowledge that I wanted to obtain and expand my mind in that way. And this is also something that we’re all going to encounter in our lives.”

The workshop made her think about a neighbor whose mother has dementia.
“ I was immediately thinking, ‘OK, there’s someone in my immediate orbit that is experiencing this,’” Vargas recalled. ‘“Here’s a practical way to put the mutual aid in use.’”
Demand for home health care, including at-home hospice care, has skyrocketed since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, as has the number of family caregivers. An estimated 63 million people in the U.S. — nearly a quarter of all American adults — provided care over the previous year to another person with a medical condition or disability, usually another adult, according to a 2024 survey by AARP and the National Alliance for Caregiving. In the past 10 years, about 20 million more people have served as caregivers.
With nearly 1 in 5 Americans expected to be 65 or older by 2030, health care experts predict the demand for at-home caregivers will continue to rise. Online resources for end-of-life care are widely available, but hands-on training to prepare people to become caregivers is not, and it can be expensive. Yet untrained family members-turned-caregivers are taking on nursing and medical tasks.
Donald Trump promised more support for caregivers during his 2024 campaign, including a pledge to create new tax credits for those caring for family members. He endorsed a bill reintroduced in Congress this year that would allow family caregivers to receive tax credits of up to $5,000, but the legislation hasn’t moved forward.

Meanwhile, the Medicaid cuts expected from Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which President Trump signed in July, could prompt states looking to offset their added expenses to reconsider participating in optional state Medicaid programs, such as the one that helps pay for at-home hospice care. That would threaten to make dying at home even more unaffordable for low-income families, said advocates and researchers.
Advocates like Osha Towers are trying to help caregivers navigate the uncertainty. Towers leads LGBTQ+ engagement at Compassion & Choices, a national organization that focuses on improving end-of-life care, preparation, and education.
“It is certainly very scary, but what we know we can do right now is be able to just show up for all individuals to make sure that they know what they need to be prepared for,” Towers said.
In New Orleans, a nonprofit called Wake, which focuses on supporting family caregivers providing end-of-life and death care, is one of the organizations trying to help fill the knowledge gap. Wake put on the free, three-day September workshop where Dunnebacke, the group’s founder, pretended to be a dying patient. Such workshops are aimed at preparing attendees for what to expect when loved ones are dying and how to care for them, even without costly professional help. Full-time at-home care is rare.
“You don’t have to have any special training to do this work,” Dunnebacke said. “You just need some skills and some supports to make that happen.”
 
In some ways, the evolution of end-of-life care in the U.S. over the past century has come full circle. It was only starting in the 1960s that people shifted from dying at home to dying in hospitals, nursing homes, and hospice facilities.
Such institutions can provide immediate advanced medical support and palliative care for patients, but they often lack the human connection that home care provides, said Laurie Dietrich, Wake’s programs manager.
Now, more people want to die in their homes, among family, but with the support and technology that comes with modern medical facilities.

In the past decade, death doulas — who support the nonmedical and emotional needs of the dying and their loved ones — have grown in popularity to help guide people through the dying process, helping to fill that gap. Douglas Simpson, executive director of the International End of Life Doula Association, said his organization recognizes the lack of resources for death care, so it is training doulas to be community educators. He hopes doulas can be especially useful in rural communities and lead conversations about dying.
“Making people more open, more comfortable about talking about death and considering their mortality,” Simpson said.
Death doula training varies depending on the organizer, but Simpson’s group focuses on teaching attendees about the dying process, how to maintain the autonomy of the dying person, and how to be aware of how they show up to a job and take care of themselves while caring for others.
Some people who attended Wake’s workshop had also attended some form of death doula training in the past. After Nicole Washington’s mother was killed in 2023, she considered becoming a death doula. But she thought the doula training, which can cost $800 to $3,000, was clinical and impersonal, as opposed to Wake’s community-based approach.
“I feel very energized, very uplifted,” Washington said. “It’s also really nice to be in a space with people who are familiar with death and grief.”
Ochsner Health’s Susan Nelson, who has worked as a geriatrician for 25 years, said there is a need for more specialized programs to train and prepare caregivers, like Wake’s.
“Learning caregiving skills is probably, unfortunately, more trial by fire,” Nelson said.
Compassion & Choices is another organization trying to educate caregivers. Towers said the group’s training ranges from advanced planning to acting as a health care proxy to caring for the dying.
“We’ve gone to a place in our country where we’re so removed from end-of-life care in a way that we didn’t used to be,” Towers said.
She said the movement to care for people at home and give them community support has roots in the AIDS epidemic, when some doctors refused to care for AIDS patients. Friends, especially in the lesbian community, started coordinating food delivery, visits, bedside vigils, and even touch circles, where patients could receive comforting forms of touch such as hand-holding to ease pain and feelings of isolation.
“I like to look at it as a blueprint for what we can get back to doing now, which is again just prioritizing community care,” Towers said.

(Photo by Blake Fagan/AFP via Getty Images)The U.S. government has caused massive food waste during President Donald Trump’s second term. Policies such as immigration raids, tariff changes and temporary and permanent cuts to food assistance programs have left farmers short of workers and money, food rotting in fields and warehouses, and millions of Americans hungry. And that doesn’t even include the administration’s actual destruction of edible food.
The U.S. government estimates that more than 47 million people in America don’t have enough food to eat — even with federal and state governments spending hundreds of billions of dollars a year on programs to help them.
Yet, huge amounts of food — on average in the U.S., as much as 40% of it — rots before being eaten. That amount is equivalent to 120 billion meals a year: more than twice as many meals as would be needed to feed those 47 million hungry Americans three times a day for an entire year.
This colossal waste has enormous economic costs and renders useless all the water and resources used to grow the food. In addition, as it rots, the wasted food emits in the U.S. alone over 4 million metric tons of methane — a heat-trapping greenhouse gas.
As a scholar of wasted food, I have watched this problem worsen since Trump began his second term in January 2025. Despite this administration’s claim of streamlining the government to make its operations more efficient, a range of recent federal policies have, in fact, exacerbated food wastage.
 
Immigration policy
Supplying fresh foods, such as fruits, vegetables and dairy, requires skilled workers on tight timelines to ensure ripeness, freshness and high quality.
The Trump administration’s widespread efforts to arrest and deport immigrants have sent Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Border Patrol and other agencies into hundreds of agricultural fields, meat processing plants and food production and distribution sites. Supported by billions of taxpayer dollars, they have arrested thousands of food workers and farmworkers — with lethal consequences at times.
Dozens of raids have not only violated immigrants’ human rights and torn families apart: They have jeopardized the national food supply. Farmworkers already work physically hard jobs for low wages. In legitimate fear for their lives and liberty, reports indicate that in some places 70% of people harvesting, processing and distributing food stopped showing up to work by mid-2025.
News reports have identified many instances where crops have been left to rot in abandoned fields. Even the U.S. Department of Labor declared in October 2025 that aggressive farm raids drive farmworkers into hiding, leave substantial amounts of food unharvested and thus pose a “risk of supply shock-induced food shortages.”
 
Foreign aid cuts
When the Trump administration all but shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development in early 2025, the agency had 500 tons of ready-to-eat, high-energy biscuits worth US$800,000, stored to distribute to starving people around the world who had been displaced by violence or natural disasters. With no staff to distribute the biscuits, they expired while sitting in a warehouse in Dubai.
Incinerating the out-of-date biscuits reportedly cost an additional $125,000.
An additional 70,000 tons of USAID food aid may also have been destroyed.
 
Tariffs
In the late 20th century, as globalized trade patterns grew, U.S. farmers struggled with agricultural prices below their production costs. Yet tariffs in the first Trump administration did not protect small farms.
And the tariffs imposed in early 2025, after Trump regained the White House, severed U.S. soybean trade with China for months. Meanwhile, there’s nowhere to store the mountains of soybeans. An October 2025 agreement may resume some activity, but at lower price levels and a slower pace than before, as China looks to Brazil and Argentina to meet its vast demand.
Though the soybeans were intended to feed the Chinese pig industry, not humans, the specter of waste looms both in terms of the potential spoilage of soybeans and the actual human food that could have been grown in their place.
 
Other efforts lead to more waste
Since taking office, the second Trump administration has taken many steps aimed at efficiency that actually boosted food waste. Mass firings of food safety personnel risks even more outbreaks of foodborne diseases, tainted imports, and agricultural pathogens — which can erupt into crises requiring mass destruction, for instance, of nearly 35,000 turkeys with bird flu in Utah.
In addition, the administration canceled a popular program that helped schools and food banks buy food from local farmers, though many of the crops had already been planted when the cancellation announcement was made. That food had to find new buyers or risk being wasted, too. And the farmers were unable to count on a key revenue source to keep their farms afloat.
Also, the administration slashed funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency that helped food producers, restaurants and households recover from disasters — including restoring power to food-storage refrigeration.
The fall 2025 government shutdown left the government’s major food aid program, SNAP, in limbo for weeks, derailing communities’ ability to meet their basic needs. Grocers, who benefit substantially from SNAP funds, announced discounts for SNAP recipients — to help them afford food and to keep food supplies moving before they rotted. The Department of Agriculture ordered them not to, saying SNAP customers must pay the same prices as other customers.
Food waste did not start with the Trump administration. But the administration’s policies — though they claim to be seeking efficiency — have compounded voluminous waste at a time of growing need. This Thanksgiving, think about wasted food — as a problem, and as a symptom of larger problems.

The approval means Malone will not be required to publish his personal finances and that the financial condition of three GCI-related subsidiaries will also remain secret. The finances of GCI Liberty, the parent company, are already public due to required filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
In October, Malone, 84, told the Wall Street Journal that he would be stepping away from day-to-day operations of his various companies but would retain his controlling interests. Bloomberg has estimated his net worth to be approximately $10.6 billion.
The approval was published just before 4 p.m. on Black Friday. The five governor-appointed commissioners said they were granting the requests because they were in line with the commission’s prior practices, because they don’t have the power to regulate much of GCI Liberty’s business, and because “the public interest in disclosure of the financial information of (the three subsidiaries) is outweighed by the potential competitive financial disadvantages demonstrated in the petition.”
The chair of GCI’s parent company, GCI Liberty, Malone holds shares controlling 53.5% of GCI Liberty’s voting power. But Malone’s personal power has been restricted until recently to 49.32% of the company’s voting power, regulatory filings state.
Now, Malone is seeking to increase his voting power above 50%. 
The commission’s Friday order does not decide that request; it addressed the combined requests for financial secrecy on behalf of Malone and the three GCI Liberty subsidiaries.
Alaskans submitted a combined 67 comments across three dockets related to Malone’s proposal. Almost all were opposed to the request for secrecy. 
In a response to those comments, Malone’s attorneys said “no legitimate public interest will be served by requiring (Malone) to file his personal financial information.”
The response also said that “the acquisition … will be seamless and transparent to customers because the GCI companies will continue to provide the same services to Alaska customers under their same experienced management. There will be no operational or management changes to the GCI companies as a result of the acquisition.”
GCI’s attorneys had argued that the financial statements of the three subsidiaries should stay confidential because GCI’s competitors were not required to reveal their finances, and it would be unfair for them to open their books.
“We find that disclosure … might create a competitive or financial disadvantage,” the regulators concluded.
In addition, unlike the way that water and power utilities’ rates are regulated by the RCA, GCI’s prices are not regulated by state law. 
For that reason, plus the fact that GCI Liberty’s combined financial statements are publicly available, regulators concluded, “public interest in disclosure … is outweighed by the potential competitive financial disadvantages demonstrated in the petition.”
On the request for secrecy covering Malone himself, Malone’s attorneys argued that he isn’t legally obligated to provide financial support to GCI Liberty, and thus, “requiring the submission of his personal financial information would not advance a public interest objective.”
They also argued that in 2018, when wealthy telecom entrepreneur Jane Eudy obtained full control of several Interior Alaska telecom companies by taking 100% control of American Broadband, a national firm, the RCA did not require her to publicize her finances.
Members of the public argued that disclosure is in the best interests of Alaskans. 
Megan Johnson, one of dozens of people who offered public comments, said, “Telecommunications in Alaska are not just about convenience, they are lifelines for education, healthcare, emergency services, and economic development, especially in rural and Indigenous communities. Decisions made by owners unfamiliar with our terrain, seasonal challenges, and cultural values risk undermining the progress we’ve made in closing the digital divide.”
Kirsa Hughes-Skandijs of Juneau wrote, “I am gravely concerned about the idea of concealing financial information, particularly when it comes to consolidating control of a public good like an ISP, broadcast and telecommunications company.”
Commissioners ultimately sided with Malone.
“We find the circumstances presented in these dockets similar to those we considered (in 2018),” they wrote.
“We find that under the circumstances … no legitimate public interest will be served by requiring Dr. Malone to provide a statement of financial condition.”
Commissioners are scheduled to make a final determination on Malone’s takeover by April 1.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/keyboard.jpeg,,,2025-11-28 22:56:53.300527

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)The state of Alaska is close to finalizing rules for a program that would allow companies to bury carbon dioxide deep underground, a process known as sequestration.
While sequestration can reduce carbon dioxide emissions by heavy industry, it also would be a boon to the proposed trans-Alaska natural gas pipeline. Many sources of natural gas on the North Slope are mixed with large amounts of carbon dioxide, and that carbon must be separated from the natural gas before shipment.  
Venting that carbon dioxide to the atmosphere would notably increase global greenhouse gas emissions, accelerating climate change.
On Tuesday, the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission announced that it had completed draft regulations for the state’s “carbon storage and underground injection” program, which will involve the state taking over regulation of carbon dioxide wells from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
The Alaska Legislature passed — and Gov. Mike Dunleavy signed — a law in 2023 that allows the takeover. The initial phases of the project were funded by the Biden administration under a federal grant. Subsequent years are expected to cost the state about $386,000 per year.
Four other states — Louisiana, North Dakota, West Virginia and Wyoming — have already assumed regulatory authority over “class VI wells” used to inject carbon dioxide; state control has tended to permit faster action on carbon sequestration projects. 
Alaska’s proposed regulation changes cover 105 pages of technically dense language. One important change: A carbon dioxide well wouldn’t be permitted if it needed to pass through a drinking water aquifer. The state allows exemptions for other types of wells, including some that could later be converted to carbon dioxide wells.
The proposed regulations include clauses that require insurance or bonds to cover the costs of accidents and a requirement that carbon dioxide wells be firmly capped when abandoned.
The AOGCC has scheduled a public hearing on the draft rules for 10 a.m. Jan. 13 at its office in Anchorage. Members of the public interested in participating in person or by teleconference at that meeting should send an email to samantha.coldiron@alaska.gov at least two days before the meeting. Written comments may also be emailed to that address.
When the new regulations are finalized, more work remains for the state. Alaska will have to formally draft its takeover application to the EPA, which will involve another public comment period.
That application will be submitted to the EPA “ASAP after public process,” according to the state’s published timeline, and actually assuming authority over EPA-regulated carbon wells would take another 12-18 months, the state expects.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/DSC05295-2-1024x707.jpg,,,2025-11-28 22:56:53.300527

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Alaska regulators have assessed a $695,900 fine against Hilcorp for violations at two wells in a North Slope oil field that is a satellite of the giant Prudhoe Bay field.
Hilcorp violated regulations for up to two years when it injected enriched gas into the reservoir at the Polaris Oil Pool, which is part of the Greater Prudhoe Bay Unit, the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission said in a Nov. 24 decision and order.
Hilcorp is a Texas-based private company that now operates the state’s largest oil field. It is the second-biggest fine for the company ever proposed by the AOGCC.
The highest proposed fine was $720,000, which the commission initially assessed against the company in late 2015 for violations that led to an accident earlier that year that nearly killed three workers at the Milne Point oil field.
Ultimately, the AOGCC in 2017 reduced the fine to $200,000, though the commission assessed other fines at about the same time for other violations at Milne Point. Those fines ranged from $20,000 to $80,000.
In its new enforcement action, the AOGCC said the fine for the Polaris field violations is justified by the company’s pattern of violations.
“Hilcorp’s repeated failure to comply with fundamental injection authorization raises the potential for similar behavior with more serious consequences. Hilcorp’s repeated failure to comply with AOGCC rules and regulations combined with ineffective corrective actions, warrant increased civil penalties to deter similar behavior,” the order said.
Also influencing the fine size is the duration of the offenses. At one well, the unauthorized injection continued for 759 days, the AOGCC said. At the other well, the unauthorized injection went on for 480 days.
Enriched gas is sometimes injected into oil fields to boost oil recovery.
The enforcement action has been in the works for several months.
The AOGCC said that in February, it formally notified Hilcorp that it was investigating the use of enriched gas at the two wells. Hilcorp then conducted an internal investigation, responding to the AOGCC in March with an analysis of the root cause and actions to correct the problem and prevent a recurrence.
Because of that response earlier in the year, the AOGCC said it is not requiring Hilcorp to submit any further written explanation.
Hilcorp has the right to appeal the $695,900 fine. If it does not appeal, Hilcorp must pay within 30 days of the decision, the order said.
A company spokesperson said Hilcorp itself brought the violation to light and that it did not result in any safety or environmental problems.
“This issue involved a highly specific and previously unrecognized authorization gap that neither Hilcorp nor prior Prudhoe Bay operators had identified. We discovered it through an internal review informed by recent AOGCC findings, and we immediately notified the Commission and self-reported all details,” Hilcorp spokesperson Matt Shuckerow said by email.
Shuckerow said the use of enriched gas is safe and permitted on many neighboring wells “as part of an effort to increase resource recovery, which results in increased royalty and revenue to the State of Alaska,” he continued.
“It caused no safety risks, environmental harm or impacts to resource conservation. We have completed a comprehensive review of all wells to ensure no similar gaps exist and will continue working transparently with AOGCC to uphold the highest standards of safety, conservation, and regulatory compliance,” he said.
Shuckerow did not address the question of appealing the fine.
Hilcorp entered Alaska in 2011, focusing first on the Cook Inlet basin, where it is now the dominant operator, before expanding to the North Slope in 2014. In 2020, when BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc. sold its remaining Alaska assets to Hilcorp and ended its activities in the state, Hilcorp became the operator of the Prudhoe Bay unit. Prudhoe Bay is now co-owned by oil companies ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil and Hilcorp.
Since it began operating in Alaska in 2011, Hilcorp has been the subject of 20 AOGCC enforcement orders, including the latest order, according to the commission’s website. Eleven concerned violations on the North Slope and nine concerned violations at Cook Inlet sites, according to the website.
Five of those orders were issued in 2024, including one that assessed a $452,100 fine for unauthorized injections at Prudhoe Bay of a type of gas used to enhance oil recovery.
Different type of enhanced recovery technique gets OK
Although the AOGCC faulted Hilcorp for its unauthorized use of enriched gas at Polaris, it has approved Hilcorp’s plan to try out a different type of enhanced recovery at the field.
The commission on Nov. 25 gave the go-ahead for Hilcorp to use polymer flooding at a different Polaris well for a 12-month test period.
The approval is unrelated to the Nov. 24 order and decision on the enhanced gas violation.
Polymers are natural or synthetic materials, such as cellulose and nylon, that consist of chains of molecules arrayed in a repeated pattern.
Polymer flooding in oil fields injects water-soluble polymers into reservoirs to increase oil recovery. The injected polymers blend with water to better sweep out oil. Polymer flooding is considered an effective technique to boost oil production, but it does not work in all types of reservoirs, according to scientists. The technique is most appropriate for enhanced recovery of heavier oils, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.
Hilcorp pioneered the use of polymer flooding on the North Slope, starting in 2018 with a test project conducted at Milne Point in collaboration with the University of Alaska Fairbanks and the U.S. Department of Energy.
The pilot project was deemed successful, and Hilcorp now uses the technique more widely at Milne Point, where polymer flooding has allowed for much better recovery of the thicker oil that is within that field.
With the help of polymer flooding and other actions, Hilcorp has increased Milne Point production from about 18,400 barrels per day in late 2014 to about 50,000 barrels per day now.
Hilcorp in 2014 acquired 50% ownership in Milne Point from BP and became the operator that year. Hilcorp took full ownership in 2020, after the acquisition from BP was completed.
The company has for years considered expanding some of the practices that have improved production at Milne Point to the parts of the Greater Prudhoe Bay Unit, which also holds some heavier oil. The now-authorized 12-month test at the Polaris well is part of that strategy.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)While the federal government steps away from climate agreements, Salt Lake City is reiterating its commitment to become more sustainable ahead of the 2034 Olympic Games with a 2040 deadline to achieve goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution.
In an update presented to the Salt Lake City Council on Tuesday, the city’s Sustainability Department highlighted milestones, including a major one — the city’s greenhouse gas emissions fell 11% from 2009 to 2024, said Catherine Wyffels, air quality and environmental program manager at the department. 
“This is primarily due to a shift to cleaner energy sources,” Wyffels said in a presentation. “So while this 11% may not seem like much, it’s important to remember that it happened during a period of a lot of growth.”

Per capita emissions also declined 25% in the same period, she said. But there’s still a long way to go to meet the city’s climate goals.
After conducting surveys across the city with a special focus on the west side, which disproportionately experiences the effects of pollution, the city found that Salt Lakers’ top environmental concerns are drought and air quality.
“People are interested in anything they can do in their homes to save under utility bills,” she said. “A lot of support for clean renewable energy for both homes and businesses. People like street trees in their neighborhoods, and then also a lot of support for increased access to transit, walking and biking infrastructure.”
All of those are solutions to the city’s primary climate risks, which according to the Sustainability Department, are driven by rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns.
The report presented to the City Council is still preliminary and is scheduled for an update next spring. Whenever it’s done, the city hopes it can help trace a path to achieve its goal to be 100% powered by renewable energy by 2030 and cutting 80% of emissions by 2040. 
Salt Lake City is in the top three metro areas in the country for urban heat island intensity, with the west side of the city feeling those effects more strongly, Wyffels said. Urban development amid continued growth is expected to exacerbate the issue.



Let us know what you think...


 


The city’s sustainability department also highlighted some achievements including an 80-megawatt solar farm that provides a lot of the city’s municipal energy and has saved around $1.5 million in electricity bills, said Sophia Nicholas, deputy director at the city’s Sustainability Department.  
“We have a lot of the solutions at hand. We just need to have the wherewithal, political will, money, to implement them on a global basis,” Nicholas said. “And it is happening actually in other countries, but when you’re looking at our emissions profile in Salt Lake City in particular, about half of it comes from electricity, and that’s why it’s been so exciting to see that we have realized a reduction in our electric grid carbon intensity due to investments in a cleaner grid.”
Despite the progress there are still some issues. Seasons in Salt Lake City are getting hotter, Nicholas said. In the last 50 years, the average temperature in Utah has risen more than 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit, about twice the global average. 
“That may not sound like much,” she said during the meeting, “but a few degrees change in the average temperature means our city and our region is and will continue to experience increasing drought, wildfires, flooding, extreme heat days and poor air quality.”
The city met federal air quality standards
For 15 years Salt Lake City and Provo, some of the densest cities in Utah were nonattainment areas for the Environmental Protection Agency’s 24-hour standards for fine particular matter pollution known as PM2.5. This month, however, the federal agency announced both municipalities were finally in compliance. 
“The achievement of cleaner air in Utah resulted from extensive planning and collaboration among the public, industry, and various government levels, leading to significant investments and the implementation of 23 new rules targeting emissions from multiple sources,” Bryce Bird, director at the Utah Division of Air Quality, said in a statement.
He pointed to some efforts supported by the state Legislature, including incentives for retrofitting and replacing high-emission wood stoves and diesel vehicles, as well as transit updates and education campaigns. 
However, in terms of energy, the state also modified its policy in 2024 to consider energy resources by listing these attributes in order of priority: adequate, reliable, dispatchable, affordable, sustainable, secure and clean. That law worried environmentalists, who said it could lead to the prioritization of coal and move the state away from a strong market of renewables.
Utah has also criticized the federal air quality regulations, even disputing Environmental Protection Agency air quality rules in court.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Holidays are a time for tradition, and for state officials and health advocates that means renewing the annual call for Marylanders to get vaccinated for respiratory illnesses ahead of holiday gatherings.
But with a difficult influenza variant emerging this season, combined with contrary messaging from federal health agencies and an anticipated rise in vaccine hesitancy, public health experts worry that the 2025 flu season will be more challenging than in previous years.
“It’s hard to predict these things, but it’s safe to say we’re at the beginning of the flu season, things are going to get worse,” said Andrew Pekosz, professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who researches respiratory illnesses. “So now we’ve got time to get the vaccine to try to minimize your risk.”
Vaccine hesitancy has been on the rise since the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. But the newest challenge this year is the unanticipated influenza variant called subclade K, which public health experts say is “less sensitive” to the flu vaccine created for this year.
It’s a regular challenge for scientists developing the annual flu shot, who make an informed and researched prediction on what strand of influenza virus will be the prominent strain. But the subclade K variant is contributing this year to spikes in Canada, Japan and other countries.
“With the flu, it is often very unpredictable,” said Susan Polan, associate executive director with the American Public Health Association. “They decide what the vaccine should be a very long time in advance and sometimes they don’t get it exactly right.”
But Polan, Pekosz and other experts say the vaccine still offers some protection and it is worth getting the flu shot as the season of holiday gatherings gets underway this year.
Health advocates worry feds’ new COVID vaccine guidelines will mean fewer vaccinations

But there lies another problem. Pekosz says that there’s still a challenge in getting people to vaccinate at all, noting that vaccine uptake has been on the decline.
State data shows that for the current respiratory season, weekly flu vaccinations peaked in October at 170,666 during the week of Oct. 11. Compare that to last year, when vaccinations peaked the week of Oct.5 at 186,868 flu shots that week.
That tracks with a national decrease in flu vaccinations between last year and now. Polan notes that there are a couple factors at play, but says the Trump administration is contributing to vaccine skepticism and overall confusion.
“The myths and misinformation that is coming out of the federal government right now related to vaccines broadly, I think a lot of people are going to be confused,” she said.
Under President Donald Trump, federal health agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have broken with other public health organizations on vaccine recommendations. Most recently, the CDC issued a controversial update to its website saying that “Studies supporting a link” between autism and vaccines “have been ignored by health authorities” contrary to the agency’s previous long-running stance that there is not a link.
Polan said the fact that the CDC has brought the debate to the forefront will likely only further vaccine hesitancy.
“The conversation has become so much more mainstream that the expectation is that vaccine hesitancy is going to get worse,” she said. “And that is a difficult challenge that we have to try to address and combat.”
But the flu is not the only respiratory illness that goes around this time of year, with COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) still posing deadly threats, particularly for the elderly and immunocompromised individuals.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Access to those vaccines can be challenging for people who don’t have health insurance to cover the costs, which can also result in lower vaccine uptake.
Polan notes that some families find it hard to justify paying out of pocket for a vaccine when there are more immediate challenges to handle.
“We know when people have to pay out of pocket for prevention, they’re less likely to do it,” Polan said. “If I have a limited amount of money available, what do I do? Do I take care of an immediate need? Do I take care of food, medicine, rent, mortgage, all of these things? Or do I pay for something … and I am not going to see the immediate impact?”
To counter this challenge, Gov. Wes Moore (D) announced a new program last week to help uninsured and underinsured individuals get access to vaccines at local health departments in Baltimore, Garrett, Montgomery, and Somerset counties, with availability expanding to more counties in later weeks.
“Nobody should be denied basic health care because of an inability to pay,” Moore said in a written statement. “At a time when the federal government is undermining public health and creating unnecessary confusion around vaccine policy, Maryland is investing … and stepping up to make sure our people are protected.”
‘Not too late’ to get vaccinated
Pekosz hopes that the Thanksgiving holiday will give Marylanders who have not yet gotten vaccinated for the respiratory illness season an additional push to do so.
Maryland advocates hope new multistate public health coalition will clarify vaccine ‘confusion’

“Now is the time that we oftentimes see a last push of people that go out looking for the vaccine,” he said. “They go to family events where people are sneezing and coughing and that makes it very real for them. I’m really hoping that this last November, December push will get some of these vaccination rates more similar to previous years.
“Cases are increasing with the flu, but they won’t peak for another four or five weeks, and the vaccine takes about two weeks to work,” he said. “It’s not too late to get your flu or your COVID or your RSV vaccine.”
Meanwhile, Marylanders are recommended to take other measures to reduce the spread of illnesses this winter, including washing hands frequently and wearing masks in crowded places like the grocery store.
“This message is primarily towards those high-risk populations,” Pekosz said. “But these are things that all of us should be practicing because everything we can do to limit the number of cases overall in the population provides that extra safety for the ones that are truly vulnerable to severe respiratory infections.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2235638589.jpg,,,2025-11-28 20:56:54.505086

Fleming is one of the many workers at Butler’s Orchard in Germantown who work months, and years, for a couple of weeks of sales between Thanksgiving and Christmas — when they start all over again.
Ben Butler, the farm’s finance and farm manager, calls the Christmas tree farm industry an “old man’s game” in reference to the time it takes to get a tree farm to the point where a farmer can begin selling trees.
Butler’s Orchard is home to more than 44,000 trees — with 45 acres of land growing about 980 trees each. It typically takes about 10 years to get one of those fields to market size.
A field at Butler’s is cleared for replanting each year. That includes adjusting the pH of the soil and removing old stumps. It takes a few weeks to clear each stump of the 2,000-2,500 cut-your-own trees the farm sells per holiday season.

A cover crop is planted to rehabilitate the soil during the summer, followed by grass seed in September. New trees are finally planted in the spring and then tended for the next seven to eight years for the trees to get large enough to be sold.
“We are hoping we can have enough [trees] to make everyone happy, but not enough to keep in this lot,” Butler said about selling enough trees to clear out the field after the holiday season.
As they grow, trees are sheared by workers to keep the proper shape. Workers individually shear trees at sunrise in the warmer months, to avoid the heat, though sometimes work stretches through hotter times of the day. They wear shin and thigh guards to protect themselves from getting hurt from the shears, and are sometimes stung by bees who hang around the trees.
“Every tree you see is hand sheared by somebody, somewhere — it’s a tough job,” Butler said.
But Fleming says there are few complaints about the work. The mood is upbeat, said Fleming, who is known to bring a speaker to play Christmas music while he and his co-workers shape up the farm.
“People beg us to come back to work here,” Fleming said. “You never even think about what time it is.”
Fleming has worked at the farm since 2017, learning all he knows about trees during those eight years. He said the holiday season is his favorite time on the farm — bringing a nostalgic feeling of the “old days” when he would cut down a tree from the woods with his grandfather.
Christmas trees are far from the only business at Butler’s Orchard, a pick-your-own farm with a calendar that starts in April for asparagus and continues through the end of October for apples and pumpkins, and hosts seasonal festivals throughout the year. That means workers spent recent weeks from autumn-themed attractions to the holiday season, with workers shoveling thousands of pounds of corn kernels out of a play area for kids on a Friday morning, and mowing paths between the rows of trees.

The area that now holds 750 pre-cut trees was changed over from Halloween decorations in a matter of days. It now boasts a holiday themed welcome sign and a Christmas tree made from stacked painted tires, along with a playground and petting zoo. The makeover was mostly done from Nov. 10-14 — even though Agritainment Manager Gina Giantonio called her team off work on Nov. 11, when a brisk wind made the temperatures feel below freezing.
Giantonio was confident that her team would still be able to finish before the pre-cut trees arrived Nov. 19. Most of the pre-cut trees are shipped from North Carolina or Pennsylvania, to ensure taller trees are available for purchase, and the rest are grown at Butler’s.
Workers get training each year on how to load trees onto the baler, which wraps trees in netting before customers take them home, and safely manage the trees each year during training. The cut-your-own workers go through similar training, with the addition of evening out the cut end of a tree and tying it to the customer’s car.
“It takes a team — it takes a village,” Giantonio said. “You can’t just do it by yourself.”
She recalled one day during a previous season when her team worked through pouring rain and slippery ice, yet still had at least 25 customers come to the pre-cut area to purchase trees.
“You work around the elements, you’re here rain or shine — you’re a farmer,” Giantonio said.
It’s not just the elements: Christmas tree farmers have been competing artificial trees, too.
“We’re up against the fake tree — the fake tree industry has done a great job of marketing their trees and we need to combat that,” said Joncie Underwood, treasurer for the Maryland Christmas Tree Association.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Butler said some customers believe buying an artificial tree may be better for the environment than cutting down real trees, but in reality, the opposite is true. Trees absorb carbon dioxide, emit fresh air and can be recycled into mulch, according to a statement from Kristin Hanna, the Maryland Department of Agriculture’s director of special projects. Butler himself has also seen birds, bees and even praying manitises make the trees their home.
“We encourage people to buy more trees so we can plant more,” he said, “If people aren’t buying them, we aren’t planting them.”
Not only is buying a real tree better than buying an artificial tree shipped in from overseas, Butler said, but it also directly supports the local economy and farm workers.
“When you support your local farmer, not only are you helping the farmer with his or her livelihood, you are also keeping the funds here — in your state,” Underwood said. Christmas trees are a product that creates jobs and revenue in both the United States and in the farmer’s region, she said.
“Tree farmers keep land open and productive,” Hanna said. “You also can’t beat the smell of a real Christmas tree in your home.”

It still has businesses concerned and some collectors moping about its demise.","The U.S. Mint ceased production of the penny on Nov. 12, although experts expect the coin still will be in your mix of change for years to come.

WASHINGTON – Earlier this month, the last-ever penny was minted in Philadelphia. Here’s what this means for Maryland consumers, businesses and collectors.
The Nov. 12 end to production of the penny had been in motion since February, when President Donald Trump announced he had met with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to discuss the cancellation.
“For far too long the United States has minted pennies which literally cost us more than 2 cents,” Trump posted on Truth Social. “This is so wasteful!”
Rising costs in the production of one-cent coins played a large role in the decision, the U.S. Mint said. Over the past 10 years, the cost to produce a penny has risen from 1.42 cents to 3.69 cents per coin.
“Economic and production factors, combined with evolving consumer behavior, have made its continued production unsustainable,” the U.S. Mint said in a statement.
Around half of consumers agree, according to a February survey from the National Association of Convenience Stores.
Although the idea has been circulating for decades, this marks the first time that the Treasury Department has made that final call in discontinuing the one-cent coin.
The end of penny production is expected to save the Mint around $56 million a year.
What happens now?
The penny still will remain in circulation and be accepted as legal tender for the foreseeable future. Stores are expected to round cash transactions to the closest 5 cents, but this may ultimately prove unnecessary, given that enough pennies still remain in circulation.
The U.S. Mint produced over 3 billion pennies in 2024, adding to the 300 billion pennies currently in circulation.

Legislation has been introduced in the House to help ease the transition by codifying guidelines for businesses, but the bill has yet to be voted on. The Common Cents Act was introduced in April by Rep. Lisa McClain (R-Mich.) and is eligible for House consideration within the next few months.
The law would “provide the guidance and regulations needed to help stores, banks, and consumers make a smooth transition while modernizing our currency policy,” McClain told Capital News Service in a statement.
Canada implemented similar rounding recommendations after discontinuing its penny in 2012, also maintaining the coin as legal tender despite halting production.
Among the 21 countries in the European Union sharing the euro as the common currency, the minting of one-cent coins (and two-cent coins) has been discontinued in eight nations: Belgium, Estonia, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, the Netherlands and Slovakia.
Getting rid of pennies or their equivalents has been a global trend.
Australia hasn’t had one-cent and two-cent coins since 1992. New Zealand jettisoned both coins in 1990. Mexico stopped minting the one-centavo coin in 1992. South Africa ended one-cent and two-cent coin production in 2002. Brazil said farewell to its one-centavo coin in 2005.
The United Kingdom, meanwhile, hasn’t given up yet on its one-pence coins.
Impact on local businesses
Maryland Local Businesses, an organization supporting small businesses across the state, maintains that the end of the penny will have minimal impact on owner and customer experiences.
“Consumer transactions are predominantly credit card-driven … so they can still price things that way,” said Connor Edwards, marketing director of Maryland Local Businesses.
Cindy Calhoun, owner of a Washington-area souvenir penny machine company, known to collectors as “elongateds,” is not very concerned about the impact on her business.
“As with all things, we learn to adapt to changes and I expect the hobby of collecting elongateds will continue to grow and adapt,” Calhoun told CNS in a statement. She theorizes that many machines will transition to pre-loaded blank copper, or convert to stamping dimes or quarters.
Others, however, are more skeptical about the policy’s implementation.
Thanksgiving by the numbers: How much Marylanders can expect to spend this holiday

“The way the U.S. went about it was thoughtless and without consideration,” said Chris Russotti, a Virginia coin collector. “The government did not pass any legislation or provide any guidance for how to handle transactions going forward.”
A group of national trade associations wrote to congressional finance committees in September about the lack of federal guidance.
Stores across the country are hoping for guidelines on rounding, handling Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) purchases and check-cashing.
“If these remedies are not addressed in short order, it will be challenging to legally engage in cash transactions with customers in growing swaths of the country,” the letter warned.
Impact on penny’s value
“I do not think the value of the penny will rise” among collectors, Russotti said, citing the massive supply of coins already available.
Edward Van Wesep, a professor at the Leeds School of Business at the University of Colorado Boulder, shares this opinion.
“I doubt that they will ever be worth anything more than a penny, and the value of a penny goes down every day due to inflation,” he said.
However, some collectors mourn the penny’s demise.
“I enjoyed buying boxes to go through,” Russotti said. “I’m saddened that I can no longer buy them from a bank.”
“It’s a strange feeling after well over 200 years for it to be over,” said “Twosheds” Gabbard, a Louisville, Kentucky, collector.

It should be a column about how Ole Miss completed an 11-victory regular season, the first in Mississippi NCAA Division I history.
Rick Cleveland
It should be a column about how Kewan Lacy ran around through Mississippi State for 143 yards and a touchdown and continues to give Ole Miss the ground game the Rebels lacked last season. Lacy might be the biggest reason why the Rebels will go to the FBS playoffs this year instead of falling just short as they did last year.
This could also be a column about how the future of Mississippi State football, whose name is Kemario Taylor and who raced for 173 yards and two scores and threw for another 178 yards in a losing cause. Taylor is a tall, sleek, ridiculously talented freshman you can build a program around, as 60,000 or so fans could attest on a sunny, brisk Friday afternoon at historic Scott Field..

But none of that is the focus of this column, and you knew it wouldn’t be. Lane Kiffin and his immediate future sucked the air out of all the rest of the storylines. Kiffin was the reason why several national sports reporters found their ways to Starkville on Friday. He’s the reason why so many Ole Miss fans will have their nerves wracked for at least one more day.
And, no, Kiffin had no definitive answers Friday. No, he said, he hasn’t made a decision. Yes, he allowed, he will have a decision sometime Saturday. “I feel like I’ve got to,” he said.
“It is not as enjoyable as people think it is,” Kiffin said of the decision-making process.
For those who have been completely out of touch, Kiffin is weighing offers from LSU and Florida against remaining at Ole Miss. To coach his Rebels in the playoffs, he would have to turn down the other suitors.
“I’ve got some praying to do to figure this thing out,” Kiffin said. ”I’m living one day at a time. I know that doesn’t help you, but it helps me.”
Kiffin said he had no idea when an announcement on his future will come Saturday. “If’s a fair question, but I really don’t know. It’s not my call,” he said.

Kiffin said he planned to go watch his son, Knox Kiffin, quarterback the Oxford Chargers in their playoff game  Friday night at Tupelo.
“I’m gonna go be a dad,” he said.
Above all else, Kiffin seemed hellbent on making it clear that he was never worried about how his players would respond to all the noise about his future.
“I know the storyline about the distractions,” Kiffin said. “But we build our team different. What you may think is distracting, I don’t think is. We teach our players to focus on what they control and to block out the rest. If anything, all that distraction bonds them together to stay focused.”
Perhaps, but that doesn’t explain the Rebel collapse in 2022 when Auburn was the well-publicized Kiffin suitor and the distracted Rebels lost four of their last five games.
As for the decision he faces now, Kiffin is clearly anguished. This comes from a sports writer not a mind reader, but Kiffin really did appear to be struggling with the decision post-game. That was especially apparent when he was asked about people he could reach out to for advice and when he appeared to become emotional. He mentioned Nick Saban and Pete Carroll.

“Obviously, my dad,” Kiffin said, pausing to gather himself. “I’ve really missed him this week.”
Monte Kiffin died 16 months ago.
So what will Lane Kiffin do? Hell if I know. I think, given his track record, he won’t make the call until he has to. Apparently, he has pretty much ruled out Florida and it the decision is between staying at Ole Miss or leaving for the Rebels’ bitter rival LSU.
My guess?
My guess is that Lane Kiffin really wants in his heart of hearts to take the LSU job. But then, I don’t see how any coach could lead his team to 50 victories over five seasons, lead his team to the playoffs for the national championship – and then say good-bye to them before the first playoff game is played.
Lane Kiffin might do that, but I’ll believe it only when it happens.

Native American and Alaska Native students attending a tribal college or university are eligible to submit up to two designs. The deadline for submissions is January 15, 2026.
The College Fund describes itself as the nation’s largest charity supporting Native higher education for 35 years. Pendleton Woolen Mills describes itself as “focused on a legacy of creating quality lifestyle products with timeless styling.”
Montanans have taken the prize in the past, according to records from the College Fund. Since the contest’s inception in 2019, it has had two students from Montana tribal colleges and universities as winners.

In 2020, Deshawna Anderson, of the Little Big Horn College in Crow Agency, won for the Courage to Bloom Blanket, the College Fund said. In 2021, Chelysa Owens-Cyr was the winner for Unity Blanket. The College Fund said Owens-Cyr, of Fort Peck Community College, continued to work with Pendleton to create jigsaw puzzles for her design and did “an amazing design with Nike N7 in November 2024.”
Bob Christnacht, with Pendleton, said the company’s partnership with the College Fund is one of its most meaningful and enduring collaborations.
“We are deeply honored that the students choose to share their artwork with us, and we remain humbled by the opportunity to help amplify their voices within their communities and beyond, Christnacht said in a statement. “Each student’s design is a reflection of personal story and heritage, and we are grateful to play a part in honoring their artistry and supporting their lasting legacy.”
The Tribal College Blanket Design Contest elevates the work of promising artists attending tribal colleges and universities, a press release said.
The first-place winner will have their design distributed on products internationally, with the top three designers also receiving scholarships and cash prizes. The winning design from each year is added to Pendleton’s American Indian College Fund collection of wool blankets.
Pendleton has worked with the College Fund since 1995 and has provided more than $1.5 million in scholarship support for American Indian and Alaska Native students attending tribal colleges and universities, the press release said.
TCUs provide a critical link to higher education, career advancement, and Indigenous knowledge for their communities, often located on Indian reservations and remote, rural areas. The College Fund provides millions of dollars to thousands of TCU students every year; the blanket design contest adds to that support while elevating Native art, culture, and stories.
Submission guidelines and applications are available on the College Fund’s website at https://collegefund.org/pendleton. Formal artistic study and textile design experience are not required. Contest design winners are selected each year by a committee comprised of Native American artists and College Fund and Pendleton staff.
Prizes for the 2025 contest winners include:

But the state can achieve the first without worsening the second, he says.","Maryland needs more clean energy but it doesn't need to consume farmland and open space to do so, writes Marshal Cahall, who points to options lke putting solar panels on manmade structures like roof and garages, and who said nuclear needs to be an option. (Stock photo/Getty images)Maryland is losing farmland at an alarming rate, with over 12,000 acres disappearing in just the last five years. This trend jeopardizes our food supply and drives up costs for local products. At the same time, our state undoubtedly needs to increase its domestic energy production.
But the sad fact is that recent policies intended to produce energy have put even more of our finite farmland at risk, threatening the very future of Maryland’s agriculture.
For instance, a new law overrides local zoning to fast-track solar development on agricultural land. Similarly, the controversial Maryland Piedmont Reliability Project transmission line raises the possibility of using eminent domain on farm parcels. These actions prioritize energy development without considering the long-term cost to one of our state’s most valuable resources — our finite and limited farmland.

Fortunately, we don’t have to choose between energy and agriculture. We can meet our energy goals by investing in smarter, more sustainable solutions.
First, let’s prioritize solar development on existing infrastructure. Solar panels should be placed on rooftops, over parking lots or on brownfields — areas that are already developed and don’t require the sacrifice of farmland. Incentivizing this approach would make these locations the default for new solar projects.
Second, we can leverage existing rights-of-way for new transmission lines. At the same time that the MPRP was being discussed, Baltimore Gas and Electric advanced a 59-mile project in a very similar area by utilizing existing pathways for transmission lines. Their project showed that by building necessary infrastructure on existing pathways, you avoid the need for eminent domain and prevent conflict with landowners.
Finally, and perhaps most effectively, Maryland can invest in nuclear energy. Long gone are the days when investing in nuclear energy was considered a risky proposition. Nuclear power is clean, highly efficient, and requires a minimal land footprint to produce a massive amount of energy.
Members of the Maryland Farm Bureau recently had the opportunity to tour Maryland’s lone nuclear energy facility, Calvert Cliffs. We were incredibly impressed by the efficiency, production and safety measures taken by the operation. This single facility contributes 87% of the state’s clean, carbon-free energy output. Imagine the impact even a single new reactor could have on our energy needs without consuming precious farmland.
Moving forward, our state leadership must choose a path that protects our farms while powering our future. By investing in these common-sense solutions, we can ensure Maryland remains a leader in both agriculture and energy.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/solar-panels-in-field-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-11-28 18:57:02.465483

Idaho Medicaid contractor to cut critical services for people with severe mental illness

The lawsuit is the second the state has faced that attempts to stop Magellan of Idaho’s plans to cut specialized mobile teams that treat patients with severe mental illness who have struggled in routine settings. The patients filed their lawsuit in federal court on Wednesday, and are seeking class-action status to protect all Idahoans on the program. 
Their arguments echo claims made by mental health clinics in a state court lawsuit last week: That the cuts would effectively end the program, risking worsening mental health conditions and overall public safety. 
The cuts, patients argue, “will have cascading negative consequences for plaintiffs and for their families, including increasing acuity of mental health symptoms, more frequent and intense mental health crises, and an overall functional decline in their day-to-day lives not only impacting family and social connections but also their own well-being and personal safety as well as the safety of others and the public at large.”
Magellan’s cuts, announced late last month, stem from the state’s attempts to avoid a projected budget shortfall, the Idaho Capital Sun reported. The private company, which runs Idaho Medicaid mental health benefits, plans to cut peer support services and the mobile treatment program, called Assertive Community Treatment, on Dec. 1.
Spokespeople for the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare and Magellan declined to comment on the lawsuit, saying they don’t comment on pending litigation.

“Acting under color of state law, the government-official defendants either have directed or authorized the State’s contractor to make devastating changes to the administration of the … program,” patients argue in the lawsuit. “But their actions were unlawful, and this Court should grant relief to the plaintiffs.” 
One patient suing, identified only as Ramon in the lawsuit, has seen his symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia drastically improve since receiving services through the program that is slated to be cut, the lawsuit says.
“Ramon is a new person. He has leveled out, is consistent with his medications, and follows through with his … treatment and management plans,” the lawsuit says. Since receiving services through the program, “Ramon has not been incarcerated, hospitalized, or institutionalized, which is quite a change for him given his prior pattern of incarceration and hospitalization.”
Before he was on the program, “his family relationship had been severed,” the lawsuit says. But the program, the lawsuit said, “has been instrumental in reuniting Ramon with his family.” 
Many of the roughly 400 to 500 people on the program will end up homeless if the program ends, Tueller Counseling Clinical Director Tom Tueller previously told the Idaho Capital Sun.

Humphreys, 68, feels betrayed by the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. “As federal employees, we sacrificed good salaries in the private sector because we thought the benefits from government would be better now, in retirement,” he said.
As the nation’s largest employer-sponsored health insurance program, the FEHB Program covers more than 8.2 million federal government employees and retirees, and it was once celebrated as a national model for controlling costs while giving enrollees many health plan options.
But next year, average enrollee premium payments in the system are set to jump more than 12%, on top of a 13.5% hike in 2025. The two-year increase is higher than what many private employers and their workers are experiencing.
The FEHB rate hikes are similar to those for plans sold on the Affordable Care Act exchanges — excluding the government subsidies most enrollees get, a major point of contention on Capitol Hill. The premiums insurers charge for Obamacare plans are rising 26% on average for 2026, following a 4% increase this year.
What’s making the latest hike in FEHB premium payments even harder to stomach for millions of federal employees is its timing: The 2026 increase was announced in October, when many federal workers were on unpaid furlough during the 43-day government shutdown.
Unlike most private employers, the FEHB Program gives its enrollees numerous health plans to choose from. That allows some people to lower their monthly premium payments by switching to plans with higher deductibles or copayments. But each year only about 5% of enrollees switch plans, according to the Office of Personnel Management, which oversees the program.
Humphreys, who has stayed with the same health plan for decades despite steadily higher prices, said it’s difficult determining which plan is best based on their health conditions. He has glaucoma and diabetes, and his wife, Julianne, has faced heart issues.
Their FEHB plan covers costs for their care not covered by Medicare, which typically pays 80% of their health bills.
“There’s a fear that if you do something and change plans and it’s wrong, you could be in a bad spot,” he said.
Open enrollment for federal employees and retirees runs through Dec. 8.
Among the factors causing premiums to increase, according to OPM, are an aging federal workforce with more chronic conditions, as well as prescription drug use, including pricey GLP-1 medications for weight loss.
About 42% of federal employees are over the age of 50, compared with 33% in the general workforce, OPM says. About 7% of federal employees are under the age of 30, compared with about 20% of workers overall.
OPM officials said the Trump administration’s policies aimed at lowering drug costs and focused on prevention of costly medical conditions will hopefully help it control premiums in the future.
“None of these initiatives of course will happen overnight – turning a $79 billion ship takes slow and steady progress,” Shane Stevens, OPM’s associate director for health care and insurance, said in a news release. “But, we are committed to improving the quality of life and quality of care for our members while also ensuring that healthcare remains accessible and affordable for those who work (or have worked) for the American people.”
OPM didn’t respond to requests for comment.

John Holahan, a health policy fellow at the nonpartisan Urban Institute, said OPM’s explanation left out a key reason for rising premiums: hospital consolidation. While the FEHB Program is a collection of health plans, in many markets — including the Washington, D.C., area — those insurers must negotiate with a handful of powerful health systems that have bought up other hospitals and doctors. That market power enables them to drive prices higher on FEHB plans, he said.
Jacqueline D. Bowens, president and CEO of the D.C. Hospital Association, said in a statement that “the costs borne by patients are not determined solely by the care they receive, but by how insurance companies choose to price, reimburse, and restrict access to that care.”
Holahan said it’s surprising that FEHB premiums are rising even faster than those of other, smaller employers. But he is not surprised federal employees don’t switch plans more often, even when it may be in their financial interest.
“It’s that people find the health care world so complicated,” he said. Holahan, a noted health economist, said he, too, finds it daunting to switch Medicare health plans.
Mike Lindquist, a scientific review officer for the National Institutes of Health, said he’s not happy with the rise in his premium payments the past two years. “It’s tough, as it’s a big expense.”
Lindquist, 43, who lives in Brunswick, Maryland, has been on the same Blue Cross and Blue Shield plan through the FEHB Program the past few years even though he evaluates his options each fall.
“By not switching, you don’t have to worry about choosing a new plan that might not take your practitioners,” he said.
Jonathan Foley, a health consultant who worked as a senior adviser at OPM during the Biden administration, said premium increases will be a hardship for many enrollees. While the FEHB Program offers 200 health plans in total, with about 10 to 20 in each geographic market, enrollment is concentrated in just a handful of Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans.
“This concentration reduces competition and gives outsize influence” to rate increases by Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Foley said in an email.
He said the FEHB Program also faces higher costs because it requires its health plans to cover GLP-1 medications, such as Wegovy and Ozempic. Nationally, fewer than half of large employers offer this benefit, according to the Peterson Center on Healthcare and KFF. KFF is a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
Another cost pressure has been more members using behavioral health benefits to treat depression and anxiety since the start of the covid pandemic, Foley said.
The Trump administration’s federal workforce reductions also have contributed to cost increases, Foley said. OPM has lost about a third of its employees in the past year, leaving fewer workers to oversee the FEHB Program and negotiate with dozens of health insurers, he said.
“The workforce reductions and the unpredictable nature of policymaking in the Trump administration has created considerable uncertainty among health insurance carriers,” Foley said. “The response of actuaries to increased uncertainty is to raise rates.”
A Government Accountability Office report this year found that recent OPM staffing vacancies led to a suspension of fraud risk assessments in the FEHB Program.
John Hatton, staff vice president for policy and programs at an advocacy group called the National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association, said higher prices mean it’s critical for FEHB members to shop and compare plans for next year. “The program was designed to promote competition to mitigate and drive down costs,” he said.
Hatton said OPM surveys show the main reasons people don’t change plans is they are overwhelmed by their options and worried about making a mistake. Switching to a plan with even a slightly higher deductible, he said, could save people a few hundred dollars a month on premiums.
But Humphreys, the Georgia retiree, said he likes that his current plan comes with low out-of-pocket costs for him and his wife. They owed little money when his wife suffered a kidney stone infection and sepsis, which put her in the hospital for 12 days.
That reassurance will soon come at a higher cost: Their FEHB and Medicare premiums will take up more than half of his pension check next year after accounting for taxes.
“I can take a lower-premium plan, but it’s a gamble I am not willing to take,” he said.

The Mountain Views Supervisory Union uses a regional cooperative model with nearby districts — an idea that is key to a proposal for state education reform.

In Southeast Vermont, a group of school districts are already out of the gate putting into practice a key feature of the redistricting task force’s proposal — forming regional cooperatives to share services. 
For several years, the Mountain Views Supervisory Union — which serves students in the towns of Woodstock, Barnard, Bridgewater, Killington, Plymouth, Pomfret and Reading — has been partnering with seven nearby districts in Windham, Windsor and Rutland counties to pool their resources under the Vermont Learning Collaborative.
Officials there say the initiative shows clear cost benefits and improvements to educational programs, two central goals of Act 73, the state’s sweeping education reform law.

The districts’ collaborative — a precursor to the type of regional entity now being proposed by the task force — facilitates the sharing of services in special education, professional development, human resources and more.
A state law passed in 2024 enables districts in Vermont to form a Board of Cooperative Educational Services, or BOCES. The Mountain Views Supervisory Union’s collaborative will soon be officially recognized by the state’s Agency of Education as the first in the state.
The five regional partnerships envisioned in the task force’s proposal, called Cooperative Service Areas, would similarly allow districts to collaborate and save money by sharing services at scale.
The educational structure is commonplace in much of the United States. Forty-three states, including smaller, rural states like West Virginia, Maine, Mississippi and Montana, utilize a form of regional cooperative service agencies.
The collaborative has generated cost savings for participating districts, officials with the Mountain Views Supervisory Union said. Districts that would otherwise be siloed and forced to pay for duplicative services have been able to access professional development services at a larger scale thanks to their collaborative, saving individual districts an average of 66% on those costs, according to Jill Graham, the collaborative’s executive director.
The task force’s proposal has generated interest throughout the state. Other districts have approached the Agency of Education about adopting a similar structure, according to previous reporting. Campaign Vermont, an advocacy group, said in a release that the state could save $334 million annually if districts share services.
The Mountain Views districts’ special education services have also seen improvement. Their collaboration has led to a reduction in the number of students who are placed outside of member districts, school officials said.
“We are seeing the impact of this resource,” said Sherry Sousa, the superintendent of the Mountain Views Supervisory Union. “And we’re getting the payback.”
Sousa says the Agency of Education is reviewing the articles of agreement between the partnering supervisory districts and will soon approve its formation. The approval comes with a $10,000 grant from the state.
‘Legacy inefficiencies’
The task force’s proposal was finalized in a draft report that will be sent to the legislature by December 1. But it has faced heavy criticism from Gov. Phill Scott’s administration.
Scott has made direct consolidation of the state’s 52 supervisory unions and supervisory districts and 119 school districts a key priority of the broader reform envisioned in Act 73. 
The change would wrest control of local spending away from school districts, but much of the law’s changes to education finance may not happen without agreement on a new map of districts.
Regional cooperatives are one facet of the task force’s proposal for the public education reform envisioned by Act 73. The group is recommending voluntary mergers of the state’s school districts.
Those mergers could be incentivized by using state construction aid to facilities creating regional high schools, a more long-term proposal in their recommendation.
Gov. Phil Scott and his education secretary, Zoie Saunders have panned the proposal, and said the task force ignored their mandate to consolidate the state’s existing districts and draw new maps of those possible boundaries.
Saunders, in a letter to the task force, said their plan “inverts the Governor’s original plan” by maintaining the state’s 52 supervisory unions and districts and 119 school districts, “while adding” five regional entities on top.
Each regional cooperative, she wrote, would “have its own governing board, executive director, and staff—expanding, not reducing, administrative footprint,” she wrote.
“The result is more governance, more overhead, and the preservation of legacy inefficiencies,” she wrote.
Scott was more forceful in his criticism, telling reporters this month that the task force “failed” in their task.
“They didn’t redraw the lines, and they were supposed to put forward three maps for consideration, and they failed,” Scott said.
Task force members have pushed back on this. In a draft of their final report, task force members wrote that they could not find evidence that direct consolidation of school districts would help alleviate primary cost drivers like health insurance, special education, facilities and transportation.
“Regional coordination, shared staffing, and well-planned high school collaborations address these drivers more effectively than mandated structural change,” the task force wrote.
The disagreements between task force members and officials in Scott’s administration foreshadow a difficult legislative session to come. Lawmakers will have to agree on a new map of school districts for much of Act 73 to see the light of day.
The debate has generated a vast amount of uncertainty in the state’s public education landscape. Keri Bristow, the board chair of the Mountain Views Supervisory Union, said the task force’s proposal preserves a local democratic process.
“You can make any map you want, but if the people don’t have any affinity with the other groups they’re pushed with, there’s just going to be a lot of problems trying to meld those people, those groups, into an Uber School District,” Bristow said. “We would prefer to choose our partners.”

The state Department of Corrections announced the Thanksgiving night death of 37-year-old Larry Thomas Dukes Franklin on Friday. Franklin was incarcerated at the South Dakota State Penitentiary’s maximum security Jameson Annex in Sioux Falls.
DCI spokesman Tony Mangan confirmed that the agency is investigating the situation as a suspected overdose.
State apologizes, but can’t explain missing evidence in prison overdose case

Franklin’s death is the fourth this month in the state’s prison system. Overdoses are suspected in two of the other November deaths, of 33-year-old Travis Long Fox at the penitentiary, and 46-year-old Timothy Tyree at Mike Durfee State Prison in Springfield.
Shane Ostercamp, 44, also died in November. He died in a comfort care setting in Springfield.
Five other inmates died of suspected or confirmed overdoses this year before November, all but one from a synthetic drug known as “K2” or “spice.” 
Attorney General Marty Jackley has indicted a handful of people in and outside the prison system for drug distribution, including one former corrections officer. Of the eight total suspected overdose deaths this year, four occurred after Jackley announced the most recent round of charges in mid-September. One of the deaths occured less than a week after the press conference announcing them.
Twenty-two men have now died in Department of Corrections custody in calendar year 2025, the highest figure in recent memory. In addition to the drug deaths, four died by suicide and others died of natural causes.

Sign up for Chalkbeat Detroit’s free newsletter to keep up with the city’s public school system and Michigan education policy.
Valerie Brown doesn’t personally know her two classmates at Western International High School who were detained Thursday morning by federal immigration officials and sent to Texas, but that didn’t stop her from helping organize a press conference that became a rally for bringing the students home.
“I have friends who have told me they are afraid to go to school. You shouldn’t be afraid to come to school,” Brown told Chalkbeat after speaking during the press conference, saying the fear is magnified by rumors of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents taking kids “whether they have papers or not.”
“They’re scared to be outside, to be with their friends. They’re kids.”
The press conference was organized to support the two 16-year-old students, who are cousins and attend Western International High School in Southwest Detroit. Outlier Media and Chalkbeat reported Monday that students were born in Venezuela and arrived in the U.S. in 2023. They were taken into custody along with two of their parents when agents raided their home on the Eastide in search of a different migrant.
Brown and others spoke in front of a backdrop at Detroit’s Clark Park. Dozens of people were there, some of them holding signs and shouting “for shame” whenever a speaker brought up something they thought was particularly egregious. All of them called for the release of the teens and the parents.
Some of the speakers, including Valerie, called on school, city, and state officials to be more involved in ensuring the safety of students who fear moving throughout the community because of immigration actions. Some called on the Detroit school district to have an immigration attorney on retainer to assist students who’ve been detained and to ensure students know their rights.
“Instead of the (students) chilling with their friends, they got to be stuck in a detention center with ICE,” Brown said during her speech. “We don’t even know where they’re going. We don’t even know if they’re going to a country that’s theirs or is even safe for them or even if they have family anymore.”
One of the speakers, attorney George Washington, said ICE agents entered the home while the occupants were sleeping. “Suddenly, ICE appears at the door, busts into the place, and tells them that they’re all being arrested.”
All four who were detained had pending asylum petitions, Washington said.
“We have a tremendous immigration lawyer from Detroit who did everything he could,” to assist the four while they remained in Michigan. But, Washington said, they were sent to Texas “too quick.”
“He’s going to continue representing them and we’re going to get them out,” Washington said.
After the event, Sen. Stephanie Chang, a Democrat from Detroit, issued a statement about the detentions:
“I am standing with Detroit teachers, friends, family and community members of these two students in urging their immediate return home to Michigan,” Chang said. “I understand that they have been following the asylum process and have upcoming immigration court dates. ICE should release them and allow them to proceed with the asylum process.”
Many of the youth attending the event were from Western International, located across the street from Clark Park. Others came from schools such as Southeastern, Cass Technical, and Detroit International Academy for Young Women.
Kenneth Russell, who attends Southeastern, was among the speakers.
“It’s better for us to all be connected than apart,” Russell said.
“It’s awful what’s happening,” said Theo Edwards, who’s attended Western for nearly a month. He was holding a sign that said “People are not illegal,” with the “not” underlined. “It’s scary, especially for those who are Hispanic.”

He is a second-generation member of the Laborers’ International Union of North America, where he serves as business manager of Local 668. He also serves as president of the Vermont AFL-CIO, advocating for workers’ rights in the Green Mountain state.
Recently, the richest person in the world was granted a salary of $1 trillion over 10 years.
Let that sink in. $1,000,000,000,000.


One person will receive ONE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS per year for 10 years to run a company. One person, already unimaginably wealthy, was handed more money than the total budget of the state of Vermont, not to mention that a trillion dollars is larger than most countries’ GDP.
At the same time of that announcement, tens of thousands of federal employees went to work and didn’t get paid because of the government shutdown. Millions of poor and working-class Americans didn’t receive their SNAP benefits and struggled to feed their families. And health care costs for working people are sky rocketing with no end in sight.
Meanwhile, the U.S. House of Representatives, the leaders we elected to run the government, didn’t meet for over a month. The president, with no sense of irony, threw a Great-Gatsby–themed party, a celebration of excess named after a story that was supposed to warn us about it.
The rich got richer. People went to work and didn’t get paid. Millions went hungry. And somehow, this has become normal.
What is happening in our country?
We used to value work. We believed that if you worked hard, you’d earn enough to live with dignity. One job could support you and your family. Now, too many companies and politicians treat workers as disposable and view the economy not as a shared project, but as a game to be won by a handful of shareholders.
The results are everywhere: record corporate profits, record CEO pay, and record levels of despair among working people. The rich continue to spend, propping up our economy while millions of people look for food. When the system rewards hoarding instead of helping, and speculation instead of service, it’s no wonder faith in the American dream is fading.
It doesn’t have to be this way. We can value labor over luxury, community over greed, and people over profits. But that means demanding more — from our government, from corporations and from ourselves. 
At the Vermont AFL-CIO, we  work every day to support workers throughout the state and raise up their voices. Through the power of collective bargaining and union organizing, working families in the Green Mountain State can restore hope for tomorrow.
Our strength lies in our unity, whether on the picket line, at the bargaining table or in the halls of government. We are one movement fighting for justice for all. We are building a future where every Vermonter earns a fair wage, has a safe workplace and can live with dignity and security. 
Because if we keep rewarding the richest for taking and punishing the rest for working, we won’t just lose our paychecks. We’ll lose our soul as a country.

(Photo by Keith Weller/USDA)Artificial intelligence and robots have potential to boost agricultural production — and their possibilities are only beginning, a University of Florida researcher told the Florida Senate last week.
UF broke ground this month on the Center for Applied Artificial Intelligence in Agriculture at the Gulf Coast Research and Education Center in Hillsborough County.
According to Nathan Boyd, a professor at UF studying weed science and associate director of the center, artificial intelligence will provide a 35% boost to agricultural production, including in Florida, by 2030. 
“We’re just seeing the start of what artificial intelligence and robotics can do in agriculture,” Boyd said while presenting to the Senate Committee on Agriculture.
Using AI to target spraying and harvesting crops could allow use of fewer pesticides and streamline processes otherwise done by humans, he said.
“Labor is a critical issue. The reason it’s becoming more of an issue is, number one, we do have aging farm operators — that’s part of it. We also do not have or have a very, very small domestic labor force for agriculture, which means we’re relying on labor outside of our domestic population, and the result of that has been labor shortages. And if you look at population trends here and in other countries, this is going to get worse, not better,” Boyd continued. 
As of May 2024, Florida had 9,640 crop, nursery, and greenhouse workers, the second-most in the United States, behind only California, which has more than 10 times as many workers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach metropolitan area had the highest number in the state and 11th most nationwide.
As of April, Florida farmers paid near the bottom of the nation to field crop workers at $15.71 per hour, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Earlier this year, in the thick of legislative discourse about cracking down on illegal immigration, Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson predicted the effort would not affect farm help. About two-thirds of crop farmworkers in the U.S. are immigrants, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. At the time, Simpson said H2A visas give permission to “the vast majority” of farmers to hire foreign nationals on a temporary basis. 
Ag commissioner dismisses economic harm from mass deportations

“We have to come up with a solution of, ‘How are we going to continue to grow the food that we do in Florida, understanding that we feed our country in the winter time? How are we going to continue to do that with fewer people?’ So, here comes the robots,” Boyd said. 
As technology improves, so do yields and quality of products, Boyd said. Technology can monitor plant health and development.
The technology, although often more accessible to larger growers, can be developed for small growers, according to Boyd.  
The Florida Department of Commerce, upon groundbreaking for the center, named agricultural technology as a new target industry. That means the state recognizes it as having a high potential to generate “significant returns on investment through job creation, innovation, and long-term growth.”

Robotic harvesting, a $236 million industry in 2022, is expected to be worth $6.8 billion by 2030, according to Boyd. Agriculture drones are expected to constitute a $18 billion dollar industry in five years, too.
The center at UF will have resources to design and build robots for agriculture, with about 100 employees. In the 2025 state budget, lawmakers dedicated $2.25 million for the center.

The wishlist for achieving a more stable health care system in Vermont is a long and lofty one: By 2031, the Agency of Human Services says it aims to strengthen the rural health care workforce in the state and increase access to timely care in those rural areas, all while increasing quality and reducing cost. 
One big piece of achieving those goals rests in moving more of the health care Vermonters receive outside of hospitals, the agency argues in its latest vision for hospital transformation, made public last week.
In a bid for a five-year federal rural health grant worth at least $500 million to the state, the agency proposes a sweeping range of expenditures, ranging from the broad — like allocations for incentivizing primary care providers to increase appointment access — to the specific — like funding more recovery housing for those with substance use disorders or investing in dialysis and ventilator units in nursing homes, rather than hospitals.

What might become a reality depends in part on grant funding decisions the federal government is expected to make by the end of this year.
The national opportunity became available in September after funding for the program was inserted into the federal budget reconciliation package to win the needed support of rural Senate Republicans concerned about the impacts of Medicaid spending cuts in that bill. 
Since then, health care professionals across Vermont have closely watched how the state might use the grant, to solidify the otherwise eroding foundation of the health care system in the state. 
“It does give us a lifeline if we use it really well,” Owen Foster, the chair of the Green Mountain Care Board, told VTDigger in October, before the state submitted an application.
Still, now that the agency’s application is public, much remains up in the air about how much funding will come to the state and what exactly it will go toward when it does.
The new funding availability comes at a time when the majority of Vermont’s hospitals face serious solvency risks and Vermonters bear some of the highest health care costs in the country. At the same time, the state’s rural populations are overall less healthy than the rest of the state, with higher rates of chronic disease, obesity, opiod-related death and suicide.
Many providers, patients, regulators and lawmakers in the state agree that the system is in dire need of a radical reboot. Some are still waiting for the details of that reboot to become more concrete.
“The proposal is more of a list of priorities than a detailed plan of what Vermont would do with federal funds if or when they arrive,” Alex Garlick, a UVM political science professor who specializes in health care policy but who is not involved in the application process, told VTDigger. 
“The ideas for shoring up the delivery of rural health care are sound, but I’d categorize them as incremental instead of transformational,” he said.
‘A holistic view’
Part of the plan’s high-level scope is because of how the federal government plans to dole out the funding.
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said they will award $10 billion a year between 2026 and 2030. Each year, half of that will go equally to each approved state — suggesting that each of the 50 eligible U.S. states are expected to get $100 million per year. The remaining $5 billion pot will go to states based on a more competitive grant evaluation criteria. 
Agency staff think it’s likely that Vermont will receive only its share of the half promised to all states, said Julie Mazza Olson, AHS’s director of Medicaid and health systems, who oversaw the application process. The federal agency has already posted its scoring metrics that the state can judge its eligibility against.
Nevertheless, the state proposed a budget for $200 million of spending each year in part to make a bid for the higher amount. But also the state agency can’t be sure which of the proposed priorities the feds will accept as ways to spend the state’s allocation, so Olson says the agency intentionally made the application flexible.
Olson said her agency tried to build upon programs for health system transformation that the state has already set in motion largely through a 2022 law, known as Act 167, a bill focused on shoring up the state’s hospitals. 
That was a practical necessity because the application needed to come together quickly: CMS released the applications in mid-September and gave states until Nov. 5 to submit them. 
“It’s a really really short amount of time to develop a plan and get the kind of input that you want when you’re doing something as complex as this,” Olson said.
Still, while trying to move quickly by building off existing projects, Olson said that the agency also tried to broaden the scope beyond hospital-specific reform. Often receiving care in a hospital is more expensive than getting the same treatment in an outpatient clinic or independent facility.
“If we’re going to have less care in hospitals, we’re going to need more care somewhere else,” Olson said. “There are other providers who we haven’t really engaged with in the same way on transformation.” 
Specifically, the application identifies investments in staff, technology and supplies for nursing homes, home health care, community mental health and substance use clinics, as well as through increased support and training for EMTs and paramedic emergency response teams.
Garlick, the UVM professor, specifically pointed to training programs for licensed nursing assistants and supporting primary care as good ideas for ways to strengthen the delivery of rural health care. 
“There are also outside-the-box considerations, including grants to increase the housing stock available to health care workers, which show the state is taking a holistic view of the problems related to health care finance,” he said.
A far bigger federal challenge  
Health care officials remain clear-eyed about the importance these funds can have in boosting a system in such dire straits. 
“Vermont’s healthcare system, including all provider types, remains under significant financial strain,” Foster, the care board chair, wrote in a Friday email to VTDigger. “We are seeing many service line closures and disruptions to patient care.  Hospitals are expected to continue to experience great financial pressure at a time when Vermonters cannot afford to pay more for healthcare.” 
Foster wrote that he was optimistic that Vermont’s application for the program would garner support, adding that he was encouraged by its recognition of the importance of preventative care and community-based providers. “Vermont has committed to intentional and meaningful health system transformation, and these critical funds would bolster our ability to transition Vermont into a sustainable and modern health system,” he said.
Still, strong headwinds remain against the rural health care system across the country as well as in Vermont. 
The changes to Medicaid enshrined in the big budget reconciliation President Donald Trump signed into law this July could result in a $137 billion loss to rural hospitals over 10 years, an analysis by the health care news organization KFF found. Comparatively, this five-year $50 billion rural health transformation grant, also included in that law, cannot balance the scale.
“The dollars that are available to us are really addressing a different set of concerns than the dollars that we’re losing. This is an opportunity, and we want to use this opportunity, but from a policy perspective it doesn’t make up for [other losses],” Olson said. 
Those losses don’t include the potential drop in income that rural hospitals can expect to come as a result of the loss of some of the federal subsidies for plans purchased on Vermont Health Connect, the state’s Affordable Care Act marketplace. Thousands of Vermonters are expected to reduce or entirely drop their insurance due to the increased expense.
The KFF authors also point out another imbalance of this funding opportunity that Vermont officials are also keenly aware of: While the changes to Medicaid would require future congressional action to ever reverse the cuts, this federal funding opportunity is finite. After five years, it is gone.
“It’s one-time money, so we have to think about how we can invest in ways to sustain it or turn things on and off,” Olson said. 
It’s an opportunity, she sees, to strengthen the system at the root, to do things like invest in concrete pieces of equipment — ventilators, mobile care technology — or programs that will have long dividends for the state, like education and training for the health care workforces.
She is wary of seeing it as the catch-all solution for all the challenges the system is facing.  
“The rural health transformation grant is not our entire healthcare system or all the things we’re doing on healthcare reform,” she said. “It’s an opportunity that we want to make the best of, even if it does not solve all of our problems.”

,DC,2025-11-28 20:53:18+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump social media post claims to void Biden orders,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-social-media-post-claims-void-biden-orders,,"President Donald Trump said Friday he will try to reverse any law, pardon or still-in-effect executive order that former President Joe Biden signed with an autopen, though it wasn’t immediately clear how that would work or whether it would be legal. Trump declared in a social media post that any documents Biden signed with the autopen are “hereby terminated, and of no further force or effect.”“I am hereby cancelling all Executive Orders, and anything else that was not directly signed by Crooked Joe Biden, because the people who operated the Autopen did so illegally,” Trump alleged. “Joe Biden was not involved in the Autopen process and, if he says he was, he will be brought up on charges of perjury. Thank you for your attention to this matter!”The White House press office didn’t immediately respond to a request for the list of documents Trump believes he has the ability to rescind based on the manner they were signed.States Newsroom also asked the Trump administration if officials believe the president would need to sign an executive order in order to implement his social media post. Experts dismissed earlier autopen challenge The post was similar to one Trump published in March when he claimed any pardons Biden signed with the autopen were void, something legal experts said at the time was “absurd” and a “red herring.”Trump brought up his frustration with autopen use again in June when he ordered the White House legal counsel and U.S. attorney general to investigate when and why Biden administration staff used an autopen. Trump said during an Oval Office appearance at the time he hadn’t found any evidence Biden aides violated the law.“No, but I've uncovered the human mind,” Trump said. “I was in a debate with the human mind and I didn't think he knew what the hell he was doing. So it's one of those things, one of those problems. We can't ever allow that to happen to our country.”Biden and spokespeople working for him have repeatedly said he knew what official documents were being signed in his name and rejected claims that White House staff used the autopen without his authorization or knowledge. Biden released a statement in June following the Trump memorandum, saying the investigation “is nothing more than a distraction by Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans who are working to push disastrous legislation that would cut essential programs like Medicaid and raise costs on American families, all to pay for tax breaks for the ultra-wealthy and big corporations.”“Let me be clear: I made the decisions during my presidency. I made the decisions about the pardons, executive orders, legislation, and proclamations,” Biden wrote at the time. “Any suggestion that I didn’t is ridiculous and false.""While presidents have regularly rescinded their predecessors executive orders, usually within their first few days or weeks in office, Congress would very likely need to act in order to alter or eliminate any laws that Biden signed with an autopen. Trump seeking to overturn a law, or part of a law, unilaterally would likely lead to a lawsuit over whether he holds that power. Trump doesn’t cite legal authorityIt also wasn’t immediately clear what legal authority Trump believes he has as president to undo pardons if Biden used an autopen to sign the documents. David Super, a constitutional and administrative law professor at Georgetown University, told States Newsroom in March that “the Constitution does not require signatures for pardons. It simply says the president has the power to pardon.”“So if President Biden wanted to simply verbally tell someone they're pardoned, he could do that. It wouldn't have to be in writing at all,” he said. “Administratively, of course, we want things in writing. It makes things a lot simpler, but there's no constitutional requirement.”Ashley Murray contributed to this report.",,,,2025-11-28 15:57:31.477217
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-28 20:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,CT strengthens data protections in wake of federal requests,Angela Eichhorst,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/28/ct-data-protections-ice/,"Federal officials approached CT's third-party vendor, asking for SNAP recipients' personal information. State officials took it as a warning.","Concerned that residents’ locations and schedules could be obtained by federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, state lawmakers passed a bill this month to prevent public agencies from sharing such personal information.
The bill prohibits state and municipal agencies, including schools, from sharing an individual’s address, hours of work, public agency appointments or “any other information that provides the date, time or place where such individual may be located.”
Scott Gaul, the state’s chief data officer, said he will be working with agencies on procedures that protect the outlined information and how to handle requests for data.
“The underlying intent of the legislation is to make sure people can trust in government and feel that they can interact with state agencies and the benefits that they’re entitled to,” said Gaul.
Since March, the Trump administration has required states to provide “unfettered access” to information like names, birth dates, addresses and Social Security numbers from all state programs that receive federal funding. Connecticut did not comply.
Then, federal officials approached the state’s third-party vendor for SNAP recipients’ personal information.
The vendor turned down the request, but it was a warning to Gaul and others that personal information could be obtained through unexpected — and “aggressive” — means, Gaul said.
Gaul spoke recently at a series of seminars geared at helping nonprofits understand how to protect their clients’ sensitive information when data requests come through the back door.
At one seminar, Eric Giannella, a researcher at Georgetown’s Massive Data Institute, advised nonprofits to provide default answers for sensitive questions and use encryption keys.
But Giannella acknowledged that many of these methods have traditionally only been available to large organizations that have designated technology staff.
For Tabitha Sookdeo, executive director of CT Students for a Dream, it feels like a “Catch-22. You’re trying to protect [your clients’] data, but you really need it for your organization’s function.”
For example, in July, Sookdeo needed to find the parent contact information for a high schooler who was picked up by ICE. Sookdeo needed to have the data on hand but was concerned that if it were obtained by ICE, it would present a risk for her client. 
“We have to become data experts,” she said.
The new legislation protects data held by Connecticut agencies, but it cannot stop federal agencies, such as the IRS, from sharing data with ICE. 
Sookdeo has been fielding questions from young immigrants and their families about whether to pay their taxes this year. For many, “the benefits outweigh the risk, because, for lots of immigration purposes, if you’re filing and you’re in the process of trying to get something, you have to show continuous tax paying activity,” said Sookdeo.
Attorney General William Tong joined a multistate lawsuit in July challenging the Trump administration’s effort to collect SNAP recipients’ personal data. He also joined a lawsuit that blocks HHS from sharing personal information of Medicaid recipients with ICE.
Sookdeo notes that the new legislation does not specifically address reproductive health care, or the sex or gender of a person. Chelsea-Infinity Gonzalez, director of public policy and advocacy at the ACLU, said, “It’s encouraging that the legislature recognized this and took an initial step during the special session.”
While Connecticut has existing shield laws and “best practices” around maintaining demographic data privacy, “something that Connecticut does not have are really holistic privacy policies for the public sector,” said Gaul. “I think this is kind of a step in that direction. But, you know, there is more that could be done on that.”
Democratic control of both the executive and legislative branches has assisted Connecticut’s ability to protect its own data, Gaul said. Last week’s legislation passed largely on party lines, with three Republicans joining the vote to send the bill to Lamont’s desk.
In Vermont, Republican Governor Phil Scott obliged the federal government’s request and handed over the data of SNAP beneficiaries, despite opposition from a Democratic-controlled legislature.
Connecticut has also been impacted by budget cuts to federal data collection.
States rely on the federal government to “set standards” of how data like race and address are collected, Gaul said. The Census homepage went dark one weekend, and the Department of Justice no longer collects data on gender-identity-based hate crimes, raising doubt about the reliability of federal statistical data.
For now, Connecticut will be selective of any cross-state data sharing initiatives, Gaul said. Some initiatives may been a “great idea three years ago,” but not now.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25161836500390-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-28 15:57:31.477217
