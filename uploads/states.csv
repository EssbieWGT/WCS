I am a school board member, but I write today as a past teacher. I am a Democrat, but I support the governor’s efforts to change our education system because we will be in crisis otherwise.
Almost three years ago, the Joint Fiscal Office Report identified possible options to contain educational costs, including encouraging or mandating more mergers, consolidating administrative services and moving education spending decisions to a statewide level. 
But there was very little discussion about managing administration. 
We have 52 supervisory unions and 119 districts. I understand that reducing the number to 12 or 13 might be too drastic to start with, but if we cut it by just half, there would be savings.
Do we have too many buildings for 80,000 students and 630,000 people in our state? There is only so much money in the pot. There will be very little money coming from the federal government. 
Moving some of the children 15 to 30 minutes away to another school and closing a small school could be an option. Why are we spending money that could be used for children on buildings?
We do not need more administration. We need more teachers in classrooms. We may have fewer children, but teachers today handle more emotional needs of the students than in the past. 
The number of children requiring special education is growing in the state. Consolidation would help with some of the costs. However, what I often hear from neighbors is “We want to keep our little school with 60 children.” We are past sentiment and nostalgia. We will be in crisis if we do not act.
The supervisory unions have curriculum directors. Are we so big that we cannot have a statewide curriculum? Principals and teachers are smart enough to take a statewide curriculum and adapt it to their needs. What is so different that each supervisory union must have a separate one?
I love town schools. But I know that things have to change. 
Linda M.W. Smith, Poultney, Vt.

(Leah Romero for Source New Mexico)As communities in New Mexico and across the country respond to the Trump administration’s anti-immigration policies and roundups by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico Director Leon Howard marked Martin Luther King Jr. Day by calling on New Mexicans to stand with their neighbors and “with every community under threat.”
Howard, who took over the ACLU’s New Mexico branch in June 2025, was the keynote speaker at this year’s MLK Day brunch, hosted annually by the Doña Ana County Branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. He spoke to a packed ballroom at the Las Cruces Convention Center, highlighting King’s words from his 1963 “I have a dream speech” as his theme: “fierce urgency of now.”
“He didn’t describe it as panic or chaos,” Howard said of the quote from King. “He meant the danger of getting used to injustice. The danger of letting the unacceptable become normal. And we’re living in a moment when the unacceptable keeps trying to present itself as everyday life.”
Howard pointed to Indigenous Americans who experienced the “machine of state power” first, and the minority communities that have been singled out in the years since — from slave patrols in the 1700s and the Chinese Exclusion Act in the 1800s, to internment of Japanese-Americans in the 1940s and profiling people of Mexican and Latin descent today.
Howard spoke of Presley Eze, a Black Las Cruces resident who was killed by a Las Cruces police officer with a gunshot to the back of the head in 2022. “Presley’s death is not an isolated tragedy,” he said. “It’s one point on a long line that stretches back through American history.”
“We have been litigating the same exact issue for generations, and now we have a new version: stops based on race, accent, language, type of work, location. A cluster of factors that government claims to create reasonable suspicion,” Howard said. “These enforcement patterns are old. The vocabulary is new.”
Howard said King’s calls for people to be good neighbors were not meant for only people who look the same or believe in the same things, but anyone in need. “[King] taught us the real test of our humanity is what we do for people who the world has decided are easy to ignore,” Howard said. 
But New Mexico has taken steps to push back against the Trump administration’s immigration policies, Howard noted, speaking of an updated “Welcoming Community” resolution the Las Cruces City Council passed in October 2025. The resolution updates a previous 2017 resolution by calling for stronger immigrant protections in the “immigrant-friendly” community and provides updated guidance for how the city responds to federal law enforcement. 
The resolution does not go so far as to designate Las Cruces as a formal sanctuary city. The Trump administration has repeatedly threatened so-called sanctuary cities with funding cuts, and included Albuquerque on a list last summer of such jurisdictions.
“That choice stands as a model the rest of the state and country should take seriously. That kind of courage doesn’t come out of nowhere,” Howard said of the Las Cruces resolution. “It comes from tradition, by standing with every community under threat.” 
He pointed out that collaboration between the NAACP and ACLU has a long history, such as the Brown v. Board of Education lawsuit that resulted in the U.S. Supreme Court finding segregated education unconstitutional. “Organizations work together not because it’s politically convenient, but because when injustice spreads across communities, the response has to spread too,” Howard said. “And if there’s one group who can’t afford to step back in this moment, it’s the next generation.”
Doña Ana County NAACP President Bobbie Green told the audience that the organization has long played a “critical role in social advocacy,” but “never, in my lifetime anyway, has advocacy been more critical than the fierce urgency of now.” (Leah Romero for Source New Mexico)
Doña Ana County NAACP President Bobbie Green told the audience that the organization has long played a “critical role in social advocacy,” but “never, in my lifetime anyway, has advocacy been more critical than the fierce urgency of now.” 
Green also said she and various local NAACP chapters are working with the ACLU of New Mexico, the New Mexico attorney general and state lawmakers to support a bill this legislative session to update in-service training curriculum for law enforcement in the state – a step toward reforming state law enforcement during a time when federal enforcement has been criticized.
State Sen. Antonio Maestas (D-Albuquerque) told Source New Mexico that the bill would authorize the New Mexico Law Enforcement Standards and Training Council to develop updated “evidence-based curriculum” for officers to complete on a constant basis, rather than every two years as is the current requirement. The bill would not address the initial training officers receive in the academy. He said he, Sen. Crystal Brantley (R-Elephant Butte) and Rep. Pamelya Herndon (D-Albuquerque) have collaborated during the interim, along with local sheriffs and police chiefs, and intend to cosponsor the bill.
“[The curriculum] has not been updated in decades,” Maestas said. “What we’d like to do is evolve policing in New Mexico to constant training; weekly, monthly training….Regardless of where people are coming from in terms of policing, everyone should be happy with this bill.”
Howard concluded his speech stating that “resistance has a throughline too,” of communities coming together and “refusing” to look the other way and ignore indifference. 
“The question for us now is not whether the moment is urgent, it absolutely is,” Howard said. “The question is whether we will meet the moment with the same courage Dr. King demanded of us, because the ‘now’ he spoke of belongs to us, and what we do with it will decide the road ahead.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/MLK1-1024x683.png,,,2026-01-19 19:56:52.415474

(Adrian Ashford/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — At this year’s King Day at the Dome, Democrats seeking statewide office this year pitched themselves to voters, urging them not to lose hope that Democrats could triumph in Republican-dominated South Carolina.
And U.S. Sen. Cory Booker, a potential 2028 presidential candidate, told the crowd gathered for Martin Luther King Jr. Day to look to civil rights history for inspiration.

“How dare we surrender to cynicism or fall to fear, thinking that the obstacles before us are greater than who we are and who we can be together,” the New Jersey Democrat said in his keynote address. “American history, if it is anything, it is a perpetual testimony to the achievement of impossible things against impossible odds.”
A crowd of several hundred gathered in front of the Statehouse on Monday for the annual Martin Luther King Jr. Day celebration organized by the NAACP’s state chapter.
South Carolina State University’s flag flew from the dome, marking the first time the state’s only public historically Black university received that honor.
The annual event started at Zion Baptist Church on Washington Street before attendees marched the roughly half mile to the Statehouse, led by drummers from SC State’s marching band.
The school’s football team triumphed last month in the Celebration Bowl, winning a 40-38 fourth-overtime victory to become national football champions for historically Black colleges and universities. Several legislators who graduated from SC State, including Rep. Hamilton Grant and Sen. Deon Tedder, asked Gov. Henry McMaster to fly the school’s flag to honor that victory.
This is believed to be the first time an HBCU’s flag has flown from the dome.
A crowd of people gathered to listen to speeches from state and national Democratic leaders, including U.S. Rep. Ro Khanna, another potential 2028 contender, and former Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison of Columbia.
SC voters will elect 7 constitutional officers in 2026. So far, most aren’t a contest.

Harrison highlighted the upcoming November elections for statewide offices.
“We need some of you to run,” he told the crowd, saying he hopes to see Democrats compete for every office on 2026 ballots.
So far, Democrats have announced bids for only two of the seven elected constitutional offices, state Democratic Party Chairwoman Christale Spain told the SC Daily Gazette last week.
Those are state superintendent of education and governor. For two offices, only the incumbent Republican has announced a run for re-election. For two open offices, a single Republican has announced a campaign. And for state attorney general, the competition so far is only among Republicans.
“Our call to action is plain,” Spain said Monday about 2026 elections. She urged people to ensure they’re registered to vote and bring friends and neighbors with them to the polls.
State Rep. Jermaine Johnson, a Richland County Democrat running for governor, said King laid the groundwork for his political ambitions.
“I will be the first Black man as the governor of South Carolina,” he said to cheers from the audience.
Johnson announced last week that he’s not running for his state House seat again, saying he wants to focus on his campaign for governor.

No Democrat has won a statewide race in South Carolina since 2006. It’s been 28 years since voters elected a Democrat as governor.
Three Democrats running to unseat Republican U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham also took to the podium to make their case to voters.
Dr. Annie Andrews, a Charleston pediatrician, highlighted that Harrison had endorsed her as the party’s nominee to challenge Graham. Andrews, who tried unsuccessfully in 2022 to unseat U.S. Nancy Mace in the coastal 1st Congressional District, told the crowd she was used to being disappointed by the government but, quoting King, urged them to “never lose infinite hope.”
Brandon Brown, an Upstate business owner, called Graham a “domestic terrorist” and described U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement as the modern-day “Ku Klux Klan.”
Catherine Fleming Bruce said South Carolina can make history by electing her, since no Black woman has represented the Palmetto State in the U.S. House or U.S. Senate. Four years ago, the Columbia author and activist ran to unseat U.S. Sen. Tim Scott but was defeated in a Democratic primary runoff.
Sylvia Wright, who’s running for state superintendent of education, criticized the Trump administration’s moves to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education, saying it would exacerbate inequality in the state’s schools.

During a stop in South Carolina last month, Education Secretary Linda McMahon pledged that the federal government would continue to fund programs. She contends the dismantling is about reducing bureaucracy to better serve students. A complete dismantling of the agency created by Congress in 1979 would likely require congressional action.
Wright said the state needs a plan, should the Trump administration succeed in its efforts, and promised she would focus on rural school districts like Dorchester 4 (based in St. George), where she worked as a district coordinator before resigning last fall to campaign.
A scattering of people throughout the crowd held signs criticizing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement with messages including “Stop ICE terror” and “we protect our neighbors.”
Khanna told the crowd that his grandfather participated in Mohandas “Mahatma” Gandhi’s nonviolent protest of British rule in India, which influenced King’s nonviolent approach in fighting for civil rights. Both were assassinated: Gandhi in January 1948, months after India and Pakistan became independent nations, and King in April 1968. King would have turned 97 on Jan. 15.
Khanna, whose parents immigrated to the U.S. from India, has said that his grandfather spent time in jail with Gandhi.
On Monday, he said immigrants are part of America’s future.
“I believe we can become a composite nation,” he said. “I believe that is our destiny — to be a multiracial, multicultural democracy.”
King Day at the Dome has become an essential stop for Democrats seeking their party’s nomination and the crucial support of South Carolina Democratic primary voters.
SC State University flag to fly from Statehouse during King Day at the Dome

After Booker’s address, legislators who asked for SC State’s flag to fly above the dome, along with the school’s president, spoke about the significance of that honor.
From the Statehouse steps, school President Alexander Conyers thanked Gov. Henry McMaster for approving legislators’ request.
“It recognizes that we are a valued partner in South Carolina,” he told the SC Daily Gazette.
After the ceremony, Booker reiterated his message of hope in an interview with the Gazette.
“I was standing in front of the Capitol dome that used to have the Confederate flag on top, and now they have the flag of an HBCU today,” he said. “If there’s any symbol of hope for me, it’s seeing something that would have been thought to be impossible just 25 years ago.”
King Day at the Dome began in 2000 as a protest against the Confederate flag, which then flew from the dome. Six months later, the flag was taken down from atop the Statehouse in a compromise that put a smaller version of the battle flag in a prominent spot on the Statehouse’s front lawn.
That legislative compromise made Martin Luther King Jr. Day a mandatory state holiday for the first time, while also restoring the permanent status of Confederate Memorial Day.
The Legislature didn’t vote to remove the Confederate flag entirely from Statehouse grounds until 2015, following the massacre of nine people at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, known as Mother Emanuel.

Bryant Clark, D-Pickens, speaks at a press conference in front of the Mississippi State Capitol in Jackson on Monday, Jan. 19, 2026, to discuss introducing a state version of the Voting Rights Act.","The audio version of this story is AI generated and is not human reviewed. It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
As the U.S. Supreme Court weighs a case that could further weaken the federal Voting Rights Act, some Mississippi lawmakers are moving to write their own version.
State lawmakers in the the Legislative Black Caucus on Martin Luther King Jr. Day filed legislation to create a state-level version of the Voting Rights Act. They said their act is designed to safeguard minority voting rights, as the nation’s highest court has indicated it’s open to revisit provisions of the Civil Rights era federal law and has already overturned some.
The state legislation would prohibit dilution of minority voters, create a Mississippi Voting Rights Commission and require some jurisdictions to obtain preclearance approval from the newly created commission.  
Rep. Zakiya Summers, a Democrat from Jackson and author of the legislation, said at a press conference in front of the state Capitol on Monday that the bill is not about one party or one race, but about protecting the voting rights of future generations. 
“I’m a mother of three sons, and what we do today determines what we do with their future,” Summers said. 
The bill would be named the Robert G. Clark Jr. Voting Rights Act, in honor of Clark, who in 1967 became the first Black Mississippian elected to the state Legislature in the modern era. Clark was ostracized when first elected to the House and sat at a desk by himself without the traditional deskmates that other House members had. But he became a respected legislative leader.
Clark later held some of the highest positions in the Legislature. He served 10 years as chairman of the House Education Committee, including during the period when the historic Education Reform Act of 1982 was passed.
Clark later served as speaker pro tempore of the House, the second-highest position in the chamber. Clark died last year at age 96. 
Rep. Bryant Clark, a Democrat from Pickens and son of Robert Clark, said his father would be horrified to know that the U.S. Supreme Court is considering rolling back the protections that he and so many civil rights pioneers fought for so heavily. 
“But my daddy taught me one thing,” Clark said. “He taught me when democracy is threatened, you don’t give up. You fight harder.” 
In a Legislature dominated by Republican politics, it’s doubtful that the legislation will gain major traction. 
In 2024, a federal three-judge panel ruled the Legislature violated the Voting Rights Act when it redistricted itself and it ordered the lawmakers to redraw some legislative seats to give Black voters in certain areas of the state a fair shot at electing a candidate. 
Republican leaders largely complied with the order, though many of them complained that the judges, who were appointed by Republican President George W. Bush, were forcing them to redraw the districts and disagreed with the rulings.
Last year, another federal judge, also appointed by Bush, ruled the state violated the Voting Rights Act by diluting Black voting strength in Mississippi’s state Supreme Court district lines and ordered the Legislature to redraw them. 
In each of these instances, Black voters were able to file such a suit because of protections in the Voting Rights Act — the same federal law the U.S. Supreme Court is considering dismantling. 
Amir Badat, an attorney with Fair Fight Action, encouraged hundreds of people at a rally on Monday to call legislators and urge them to pass the voting rights legislation and to signal to the U.S. Supreme Court that overturning federal voting protections would be a grave mistake. 
“Justice does not move on its own,” Badat said. “People move it. So today we are choosing to move. We are choosing to fight.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/19170002/MG_9087.jpg,,,2026-01-19 19:56:52.415474

(Bill Lucia/Washington State Standard)Washington state’s plan to transition the biggest ferry system in the United States to hybrid-electric by 2040 by purchasing new boats and undertaking complex conversions with several of our existing ferries is ambitious and laudable. No one disputes that we are in dire need of new ferries. Six of 21 ferries were pulled from service in recent weeks, and the converted hybrid electric ferry Wenatchee has been pulled for repairs several times since being put into service in July. 
Washington State Ferries has been struggling with reliability for years, and some important steps have been taken towards righting the ship. Gov. Bob Ferguson prioritized restoration of reliable ferry service and has made changes and investments that make good on campaign promises. In addition to committing to building new ferries, the governor elevated the director of the ferry system to a cabinet-level position, and postponed taking the M/V Tacoma and Puyallup ferries out of service for conversion so as not to disrupt ferry service during the busy summer season and with the World Cup coming to Seattle. 
But what’s driving unreliable ferry service today isn’t just too few boats on the water. Cancelled and delayed sailings are more often the result of a lack of licensed engine room crew required by Coast Guard regulations, and also a backlog of maintenance and repairs needed for a fleet of boats that, on average, are more than 50 years old. It is marine engineers who are responsible for operating, repairing and maintaining all the systems that keep ferries running smoothly. Few passengers are aware of this highly skilled workforce because they are out of sight below the car deck in the engine room, but they are essential to safe, reliable ferry service.
Washington State Ferries used to be one of the best-paying ferry systems in the country, but wages haven’t kept up with the market. Today, wages for engine room crews have fallen 20% below those of our deck counterparts. Because the state failed to close the wage gap in our last contract, we are still short-staffed. Adding to the challenges, we are on the edge of a retirement cliff, with half of our most skilled and experienced crew eligible to retire in 2027.
Without competitive wages, we won’t have enough licensed crew to operate and repair the new hybrid electric fleet vessels when they come into service. Skilled mariners are choosing private-sector shipping companies or other ferry systems that provide better wages and benefits. 
The good news is that the cost of closing the wage gap for marine engineers is minuscule compared to more than $1 billion being spent on new ferries. But if that gap isn’t closed, those new boats won’t be able to sail. The state needs to balance its investments in greening the fleet for the future with support for competitive wages necessary to recruit and retain crewmembers essential to ferry service today — a need that will be even greater when we have a full fleet of hybrid-electric vessels ferrying passengers around the Puget Sound in the years to come.
The first few months of operating the Wenatchee after it was converted to hybrid-electric demonstrated the complexity of merging old and new systems. One takeaway has been how important extensive sea trials and training on the new systems will be. With competitive wages, we’ll be better able to keep our senior engineers long enough for new crew to gain the experience and credentials to step into those roles.
Ferry routes are a critical part of our state’s transportation system. Canceled and delayed sailings have serious impacts on the people and businesses that depend on them for goods, transportation to work, medical appointments, and school. Washington State Ferries are one of the state’s leading tourist attractions, pumping millions of out-of-state dollars into the local economy. Ferry-dependent communities and all Washington taxpayers deserve to have a reliable system and that is only possible when engine room crew are paid fair wages.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/samish-ferry-boat-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-19 18:56:53.556073

(Photo by Bill Lucia/Washington State Standard)Reviews are in for Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson’s debut budget blueprint. They are mostly two thumbs down.
In the course of six hours of public hearings over three days last week, dozens of people criticized the governor’s approach to closing a projected $2.3 billion shortfall.
They booed his push to cap access to a coveted child care program, cut funding for public schools and colleges, and redirect climate dollars away from pollution reduction and toward tax credits for low-income working families.
There was applause for Ferguson’s embrace of an income tax on millionaire-earners. But because it could be years before it might generate revenue, testifiers urged members of the House and Senate budget-writing committees to find ways to raise money sooner.
A recurring theme was the lasting negative effects of further paring public resources after the widespread reductions made last year to plug a budget hole that Ferguson pegged at $16 billion over four years.
Tyler Muench of the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction said “significant cuts” proposed to popular programs like Running Start and cancellation of a planned funding boost for rural school districts carry longer-term consequences.
“OSPI cannot continue to absorb cuts and still deliver services that Washingtonians expect and deserve,” he said.
Ferguson’s budget director foresaw the negative response and empathized with lawmakers who are crafting their own spending plans in the House and Senate.
“It’s a very difficult set of budget decisions that we dealt with and that you all will have in front of you as well,” said K.D. Chapman-See, Ferguson’s chief budget writer, in presenting the governor’s proposal at hearings in the House Appropriations and Senate Ways and Means committees.
The big picture
Ferguson, a Democrat in his first term as governor, released his budget proposal Dec. 23. It makes adjustments to the two-year budget he signed in May and that took effect July 1, 2025.
The governor and legislative Democrats balanced the budget with a combination of billions in cuts and more than $9 billion in new and higher taxes.
Since last spring, the state has collected less in taxes than expected while dealing with greater demand for services, rising expenses due to inflation and costly new federal requirements under congressional Republicans’ so-called “Big Beautiful Bill.”
The state is facing another shortfall. This one is $2.3 billion in the current operating budget, which runs through mid-2027. Ferguson proposes to patch it by trimming $800 million in spending, withdrawing $1 billion from the state’s rainy day reserve fund, and using revenues from the state’s auctions of air pollution allowances to shore up other programs.
Chapman-See said tapping into the rainy day fund, formally known as the budget stabilization account, was “a really, really difficult decision” for the governor. It got to the point where they were discussing cuts to critical services that he was not comfortable making, she said.
The reductions he settled on are what drew fire at the hearings.

Changes in child care programming account for nearly 40% of the reductions, advocates say.
Ferguson wants to close enrollment to the Working Connections Child Care program that provides lower-income families with subsidies to pay for care. There were 44,333 enrolled as of last February, with an active caseload of 33,465 as of November 2024, the Department of Children, Youth and Families reported in the summer.
The governor wants to halt new sign-ups until the caseload drops to 33,000. It is estimated that this will save $217 million.
He also wants to freeze the level of state funding to child care centers, rather than proceed with a previously approved increase. That is a $41 million cut for providers.
“Child care should never be a discretionary line item as it is the work that makes all the other work possible,” said Alex Galeana, executive director of the Children’s Campaign Fund. “Please reject these reductions and stand by children and families.”
Ferguson’s plan calls for 3% cuts in funding to Washington State University and the University of Washington, and 1.5% for community and technical colleges.
Jacqui Cain, president of the American Federation of Teachers in Washington, said across-the-board cuts would have “immediate consequences. Even modest cuts lead to hiring delays, fewer course offerings, and increased workloads.”
She also called on lawmakers to restore a provision concerning the Workforce Education Investment Account, which derives its money from a tax imposed on very large high-tech firms.
Ferguson and Democratic lawmakers made a change last year to allow the dollars, which will total hundreds of millions in this budget cycle, to be used to supplant spending from the general fund. It is limited to this budget. Absent that revision, those dollars were used to supplement higher education spending.
Not using the dollars as originally intended could lead to hiring freezes, program cuts and less financial aid, critics warned.
Chris Mulick, senior director of state relations for Washington State University, said a proposed 3% cut in the Cougars’ financial hide would be the fifth straight year of reductions.
“Just in the past six months, we’ve cut administration, academic programming, and public service while eliminating several hundred jobs,” he said.
Mulick then delivered uncharacteristically sharp remarks on what he said is a proposed quadrupling of WSU’s premium for the state’s self-insurance liability coverage “without any corresponding increase in claims or payouts.”
To cover the increase, he said, the governor counts on new tuition revenue “that never existed in the first place,” and that had at one point been earmarked for other spending.
“These are the same phantom tuition dollars that were supposed to have partially funded university COLAs but didn’t,” he said, referring to cost-of-living adjustments for employees. “It’s absolute make-believe and it sharply increases our already outlying cut to well beyond 5%. Please don’t do this.”
Some of the strongest criticism came from foes of Ferguson’s desire to redirect $569 million of proceeds from carbon auctions under the Climate Commitment Act into the Working Families Tax Credit program. 
“Our members are outraged at the proposal,” said Robin Everett, deputy director for the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal Campaign. They recognize the budget challenge and “share the goal of keeping our lowest income folks afloat during difficult times. But we also can’t ignore the climate crisis that is unfolding,” she said.
Use of the money for the tax credits is allowed under the law that created the climate program.
While the idea may be “technically legal, it is profoundly out of step” with the spirit of the law, Everett said. “Gutting this program will set a deeply troubling precedent.”
Not everyone’s unhappy
Those with kudos for Ferguson’s handiwork urged lawmakers to follow his lead.
Dawn Rains, chief executive officer of Treehouse, said a $7 million cut last year forced the nonprofit to end services to 400 students in foster care aimed at helping them graduate high school.
A patchwork of private and one-time funding helped keep the group going. But that approach “is neither sustainable nor equitable,” she said.
The governor’s budget restores $3.5 million, a sum that “would stabilize and expand a proven program” for some of Washington’s most vulnerable students, she said. 
An $8.5 million cut to a program supporting access to abortion-related services was one of the more controversial budget moves last year. Restoring those dollars to the Abortion Access Project is the top priority of Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates — and it is in the proposed budget. 
The five abortion care agencies in the state supported by the program provided 80% of the total abortions in 2022, according to the Department of Health’s Center for Health Statistics. These clinics are located in 20 out of the 39 counties in Washington state. Planned Parenthood is the largest recipient of funds from the program.
“Without full restoration, patients will likely see reduced services, limited appointment times, higher out-of-pocket costs, fewer management options, and less secure health centers, and even clinic closures,” said Nicole Kern, government relations manager for the alliance.
How much of Ferguson’s proposal survives will become clearer when majority Democrats in the House and Senate release their respective spending blueprints. Those will come out following the next revenue forecast on Feb. 16.

This story by Marion Umpleby was first published in Valley News on Jan. 19, 2026.
SOUTH ROYALTON — To the unknowing passerby walking down Chelsea Street last week, RB’s Delicatessen may have looked like a business on its way out of town.
A large dumpster outside the store was filled to the brim with garbage and discarded odds and ends, while inside, Brenda Cohen, the building’s owner and RB’s original founder, was busy cleaning out the deli with the help of a handful of friends. 
“This was overwhelming. There was no way we were going to let (Cohen) tackle it on her own,” Mike Barnaby, a Tunbridge resident who’s known Cohen since he was a kid, said while using a razor blade to scrape a Monster Energy decal off a store window. 
But in spite of appearances, RB’s isn’t going anywhere. It is, however, getting a new owner. Daisey Darling, who had owned the South Royalton deli since 2014 with her now ex-husband Anthony Salls, decided to close the business in December as the pair went through a divorce and the business struggled to be profitable. 
After closing the deli, she asked Cohen to “take the store back,” Darling said. It wasn’t long before Cohen found a new person to take up the reins. Cohen declined to name the new owner because she said the person wasn’t ready to be identified publicly.
Cohen and her late husband Roger Cattabriga opened RB’s on South Royalton’s main drag in 1991. Over the years, the store has become a reliable spot to get a quick lunch, a carton of cigarettes or a pack of beer.

Darling, a Royalton native, got a job at RB’s when she was 18. When she found work in construction soon after, she kept the job at RB’s to tie her over during the winter off-season.
When Cohen decided to retire and devote her time to her dream of raising her Irish Setters for national competitions, Darling and Salls purchased the business for $200,000. 
“I was excited to own something and contribute more to the community,” Darling said.
When Darling took over RB’s, she was no stranger to life in a family-run business. At age 7, she started helping out at her parents’ sawmill on Waterman Road in Royalton. Working there was “always so fun,” Darling said.  Running RB’s gave her an opportunity to give back to her hometown. 
Pam Levasseur, a member of the Royalton and Area Lions Club, said Darling used her connections with a purveyor to secure discounted ingredients for the club’s burger booth at the town’s annual Old Home Days. 
“She did so much for the community,” Levasseur said. 
Darling also ran a pay-it-forward system at RB’s where customers could buy a grocery item such as a carton of milk or a can of soup, and leave a note indicating that it had been paid for so someone else could take it home for free. 
Open until 9 or 9:30 p.m. depending on the day, RB’s also was a reliable place to get the odd ingredient or household item when other stores such as the nearby South Royalton Market had closed for the day. 
RB’s “has been a staple here for years,” Sherri Michaud said while cutting hair at Sherri’s Headquarters Ltd., the salon she runs two doors up from the deli. 
The ready-made meals such as spaghetti and Shepherd’s pie became Michaud’s “go-to” when she needed a quick lunch between seeing clients. 
The deli also offered a menu of coffee, sub sandwiches, salads, fried food, and in the summer, ice cream served out of a window at the front of the store. 
Even though RB’s was a beloved spot in town, turning a profit wasn’t easy, especially after Dollar General, a discount retailer chain, opened in late 2024 on Route 14, a few minutes’ drive from the village center, Darling said. 
After the store opened, she noticed a decline in sales of grocery items such as milk, but she couldn’t afford to match Dollar General’s prices.   
Several Upper Valley general stores have closed their doors in recent years, including Erin’s General Store in West Fairlee, which shuttered in 2024 after reopening under a new owner four years prior. Other Upper Valley towns where general stores have closed include Brownsville, Canaan Village, Cornish, Grafton, Quechee and Taftsville, the Valley News reported in 2024.
Darling estimates she made a net profit of $700 last year, after paying staff and bills and buying product for the store. 
The divorce added additional strain. “It really went downhill when we split and there was no heart left,” Darling said. 
Since closing the deli, she’s found new work which she declined to detail. 
More than anything, she’s going to miss the high school kids she employed. “I love kids. They don’t judge you,” she said.
Now Cohen and her friends are focused on getting RB’s ready for a professional deep clean and giving the deli a paint job in advance of a tentative opening in early April.
“Time for (the store) to get cleaned up and get a new start,” Barnaby said.

After owning Radio Bean for more than 25 years, Lee Anderson announced Sunday that he’s ready to hand off the downtown Burlington bar and music venue and let what he calls “the spirit of the Bean” live on with someone else. 
The news comes only six months after Nectar’s, a fixture of the Queen City’s music scene, announced it would close in July. The business was floundering as a result of a drawn-out city construction project on its block and perceived public safety challenges downtown, the company said. 
But only several blocks away, Anderson promises that the show will go on — whether in front of a glittery curtain or below a sky full of twinkling misfit lamps. Gigs are on the books for the coming months, he said.

When Anderson first opened the joint, he was 22 years old and lived in an apartment upstairs. He paid for it with several credit cards and managed it day and night, he said. But now the 47 year-old lives about an hour away in Lincoln, where he helps raise his two young children, he said. 
“My relationship from me to the business is just different now,” he said. 
It felt like the right time for him, the venue and the community to consider other ownership options, he said. 
Anderson wrote in a social media post that he would ideally like to see a group of people co-own and operate the place, allowing him to stay involved. But he’s open to different possibilities, he said, and wants to reassure people that Radio Bean “isn’t going to vanish.”

Since his announcement, many people have reached out to Anderson with messages thanking him and proposing ideas about the future, he said. After running the place for so long, he’s seen the children of couples who met at the bar grow up, Anderson said. 
And he’s seen the place itself evolve. For its first 10 years, the Bean often hosted theater performers and puppeteers, Anderson said. Now it gets mostly musical acts.
At the venue’s “25th Birthday Bash” in November, the setlist convened over 100 acts. That night, a man in his underwear wore a giant hat shaped like a nose while he played the accordion to a sea of laughing people. At the same time in the venue’s other room, local rap group A2VT moved a bumping crowd. 
Over the years, he said he’s had supernatural experiences that moved him, including seeing unplugged lamps glow with light, which left him with a reassuring feeling. 
“That’s telling me — whatever you’re doing right now is exactly what you should be doing right now,” he said. 
Anderson has announced a “State of the Bean” meeting Wednesday, where he hopes to get people together and listen to their “hopes and dreams and fears” about the venue’s future, he said.

WILMINGTON, Del. — Three Wilmington City Council members on Monday used MLK Day to renew calls for sweeping affordability reforms, reviving a debate that last year drew sharp resistance from Mayor John Carney and state housing officials who warned that rent stabilization could undermine housing supply and investment.
Council members Coby Owens, Shané Darby, and Christian Willauer held a press conference to outline a broad affordability agenda addressing rising rents, property taxes, water bills, and homelessness. The plan is endorsed by the Working Families Party of Delaware and builds directly on Darby’s 2025 rent-stabilization proposal, which stalled amid opposition from city and state leaders.
While supporters argue the measures are needed to prevent displacement, critics — including Carney and Gov. Matt Meyer’s housing administration — have warned against similar plans, calling instead for increasing housing supply and not regulating prices, as a more effective long-term solution.
Council Members Frame Urgency
Owens, who represents the city’s 1st District, focused on housing conditions and homelessness, calling it unacceptable for residents to be forced into unsafe housing or onto the streets.
Owens said Darby’s earlier rent bill would not stop rent increases, but would “slow them a little bit,” giving families time to adjust while other solutions are pursued.
Darby, the 2nd District council member and a longtime advocate of rent stabilization, framed the issue as one affecting working- and middle-class residents.
“It isn’t just about protecting the poor,” Darby said during a previous City Council committee meeting. “This is about working-class and middle-class residents — the backbone of our city — who are being priced out of their homes year after year.”
Willauer, who represents the 5th District, emphasized property tax fairness and the need to pair tenant protections with relief for homeowners and small landlords.
“We need to do something about the rising cost of rent now,” Willauer said in an earlier interview, “while we’re putting in place other long-term solutions like more housing that people can afford.”
What the Plan Calls For
The agenda includes:


Rent stabilization limiting annual increases


Restoring pre-rental housing inspections


Correcting property tax assessment errors


Creating a housing trust fund


Expanding eviction-prevention assistance


Limiting water shutoffs and foreclosures


Increasing shelter and supportive housing capacity


Council members said legislation reflecting these ideas will be introduced in coming weeks.
Carney, State Officials Push Back
The proposals revive objections raised in 2025, when Darby’s rent stabilization ordinance faced stiff resistance from the Carney administration and state housing officials.
Mayor Carney opposed the measure outright, with his administration warning that the city lacked the staffing and expertise to enforce rent caps. Daniel Walker, Carney’s deputy chief of staff, said at the time that the city should focus on expanding housing supply rather than regulating rents.
“Our position is that we double down on what we know is working in increasing the supply of affordable housing across the city of Wilmington,” Walker said.
At the state level, Matthew Heckles, director of the Delaware State Housing Authority under Gov. Matt Meyer, also warned that rent stabilization could discourage development.
“This won’t be easy, and it won’t be quick, but this is the solution,” Heckles wrote in a May 7, 2025 email to city officials, referring to new construction. “It is critical that Delaware not close the door on this path, and I believe rent control will do exactly that.”
Heckles later said rent caps could signal to developers that Delaware may limit financial returns on housing investments, adding that decisions made in Wilmington carry statewide implications.
“What is done in Wilmington has implications across the state,” Heckles said. “It’s the largest city in the state.”
Landlords, Moderates Echo Concerns
Landlord groups and moderate council members also raised concerns during last year’s debate, many of which remain unresolved.
Local landlords warned that rent caps could make it difficult to cover rising costs for taxes, insurance, and maintenance, particularly in older buildings. Some said the policy could push small, local landlords to sell to out-of-state investors.
“Tenants in controlled units will become a privileged class,” landlord Adam Bivens told council last year, warning that uncontrolled units could see higher rents to compensate.
Several council members questioned how enforcement would work and where fines or penalties would go. Others warned that rent stabilization could punish responsible landlords who already keep rents reasonable.
A Broader Affordability Debate
The renewed affordability push comes as Wilmington residents continue to face rising costs. About 54% of city residents rent, nearly one in four live below the poverty line, and median household income remains well below the state average.
Supporters argue immediate protections are needed as federal rental assistance programs have ended. Critics counter that price controls risk shrinking housing supply and delaying investment, making affordability worse over time.
With legislation expected soon, the debate that divided City Hall in 2025 is once again shaping up as one of Wilmington’s most consequential policy fights — balancing urgency for relief against concerns over long-term economic impact.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/820NMadisonStWilmingtonDE19801.jpg,,,2026-01-19 17:56:45.743744

(Photo by Shannon Heckt/Virginia Mercury)Two days after taking the oath of office as the first woman to lead Virginia, Gov. Abigail Spanberger on Monday urged lawmakers to move quickly on a slate of constitutional amendments and cost-of-living legislation, framing the moment as an early test of whether Virginia’s new political alignment can deliver results.
In her first address to a joint session of the General Assembly, Spanberger outlined her governing priorities and pressed for swift action on four Democratic-backed constitutional amendments, singling out a proposal that would allow lawmakers, under narrow circumstances, to redraw congressional maps mid-decade. 
She described the measure as narrowly tailored to counter what she said are growing efforts in other states to undermine democratic norms.
“Virginia’s proposed redistricting amendment is a response to what we’re seeing in other states that have taken extreme measures,” Spanberger said, emphasizing that any change would be “short-term, highly targeted, and completely dependent on what other states decide to do themselves.” 
Ultimately, she said, voters should have the final say.
Spanberger also voiced strong support for amendments protecting reproductive freedom, marriage equality and automatic restoration of voting rights for Virginians who have completed felony sentences — all of which will now be on the ballot in November. 
Democrats have argued the measures are necessary to lock in rights they fear could be rolled back through future court rulings or shifting political control.
Beyond constitutional questions, the new governor used the address to press lawmakers to focus on affordability — an issue she repeatedly returned to as the defining challenge of her administration. 
She pointed to rising housing costs, prescription drug prices and energy bills as pressures cutting across regions and party lines.
“More than 70% of Virginians say they cannot find housing they can afford to rent or buy,” she said, rejecting claims that affordability concerns are exaggerated. “This is not a hoax. This is real life.”
Spanberger said executive actions she signed immediately after her inauguration are intended to jump-start that effort, including orders directing agencies to identify ways to cut costs for families and to review regulations that slow housing construction. 
But she also emphasized that lasting relief will require legislation.
To that end, she pointed to what she called an “Affordable Virginia Agenda,” asking lawmakers to move a package of bills aimed at lowering costs in health care, energy and housing. 
The proposals include new rules governing pharmacy benefit managers to push drug rebates back to patients, targeted assistance to offset rising Affordable Care Act marketplace premiums, and incentives to recruit health care providers to underserved areas.
On energy, Spanberger called for expanded energy storage, increased weatherization programs for low-income households and renewed commitment to a diversified power mix that includes solar, nuclear and offshore wind. 
She pledged to rejoin the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, saying its proceeds previously helped fund flood mitigation and energy-efficiency programs. Her comments come as Virginia’s offshore wind project has faced renewed uncertainty amid federal actions. 
Housing proposals outlined in the speech included extending the period tenants have to respond to eviction filings, giving localities more flexibility to adopt affordable housing programs and creating a revolving loan fund to finance mixed-income developments.
Republicans offered a competing affordability vision following the address. 
House Minority Leader Terry Kilgore, R-Scott, said House Republicans agree that lowering costs should be the General Assembly’s top priority and pointed to their newly announced the GOP’s “Affordability Done Right” agenda, which includes eliminating the grocery tax, phasing out the car tax, making the higher standard deduction permanent, lowering power bills and expanding auto insurance options. 
If the governor “truly wants to make life more affordable,” Kilgore said, she should support those proposals.
In her speech, Spanberger also waded into debates over public safety and gun policy, calling on lawmakers to revive measures vetoed in recent years. 
She said she respects the Second Amendment but urged passage of bills banning ghost guns, restricting firearm access for convicted domestic abusers and strengthening “red flag” laws.
“These are commonsense measures,” she said. “Virginia is ready. And I am ready to sign. Send them to my desk.”
Education was another focal point, with Spanberger calling for higher teacher pay and renewed emphasis on reading and math instruction after Virginia ranked last nationally in math recovery. 
She said her administration would avoid what she described as culture-war battles in classrooms and instead prioritize academic outcomes and partnerships between parents and educators.
The governor also addressed higher education governance, announcing a review of appointments to boards of visitors and signaling support for reforms to prevent future administrations from politicizing university leadership — a topic that has generated intense scrutiny in recent months.
Woven throughout the speech was a warning about economic turbulence stemming from Washington, including federal job cuts, trade policies and their ripple effects on Virginia’s economy. 
Spanberger said she has created an Economic Resiliency Task Force to assess the damage and recommend responses, particularly for displaced federal workers and rural communities affected by declining exports through the Port of Virginia.
While emphasizing bipartisanship — noting she was ranked among the most bipartisan members of Virginia’s congressional delegation — Spanberger said she would not shy away from confronting federal actions she believes harm the commonwealth.
“When federal actions attack and threaten Virginia jobs, I will not hesitate to push back,” she said.
She closed by invoking the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., whose holiday coincided with the address, urging lawmakers to reject political intimidation and dehumanization and to model a different approach to governance.
“Disagreement need not mean contempt,” Spanberger said. “Before anything else, we are all Virginians.”

This story by Tim Calabro was first published in The Herald on Jan. 15, 2026.
After more than 30 years of developing and managing affordable housing and community initiatives in the Randolph area, the Randolph Area Community Development Corporation has announced that it will dissolve over the course of 2026. Executive Director Peter Reed confirmed the transition, citing dwindling funding sources, project pipeline issues, and organizational sustainability as key factors in the decision.
Founded in the aftermath of a series of devastating downtown fires in 1991 and 1992, RACDC has been a driving force in affordable housing in Randolph, developing properties including Randolph House, Joslyn House, Branchwood Apartments, the Red Lion Inn and the Jacobs and Armstrong mobile home parks, among others. The organization’s departure marks the end of a local era, but its leadership is working to ensure a smooth transition of its housing stock and community programs.
“We’ve had the writing on the wall for the last year and have been kind of trying to position ourselves to deal with it as effectively as we could,” Reed said.
The majority of RACDC’s properties — including Randolph House, Branchwood Apartments, Red Lion Inn, and the two mobile home parks — are slated to be transferred to Downstreet Housing & Community Development, a larger, Barre-based organization that manages hundreds of affordable units across central Vermont.
“Downstreet … they manage something in the range of 450 apartments and mobile home lots. So they’re probably three times bigger than RACDC is today,” Reed said. “They do similar activities. We’ve worked with them in the past on a number of projects. It’s a good organization.” 
One exception is Joslyn House, an independent senior housing facility, which will be transferred to a new nonprofit being formed by the Wright family. The family has long been involved with the property — Becky Wright currently serves as the resident manager, following in the footsteps of her mother, Arlene.
“It’s a great little community,” Reed said. “There was a [Vermont Public] Rumble Strip story about it recently. … Yhe tagline on the story was, ‘Every town should have a Joslyn House.’”
Changing federal landscape
At the core of RACDC’s decision is a shift in federal housing policy and funding, Reed said.
“In the current federal environment with cutting back on many different supports for people in need, including housing … HUD has been significantly cut back,” said Reed. “Funding for low-income housing has definitely dropped. It starts at the federal level, then they send blocks of funds to the state, and the state allocates them around. So there’s just less of a pool,” he said.
The dearth of funding for affordable housing projects has had ripple effects for RACDC. “Financially if we don’t do projects every year or two, we can’t fund the organization.”
Reed noted that while the funding challenges have been mounting for some time, the final blow came last year in the middle of work on the Salisbury Square project, a novel affordable housing development integrating smartgrid technology.
“We had a second phase of that for single-family homes that we don’t have funding for now,” Reed said. “We had some funding from the state that got pulled in the spring just because they were concerned that we wouldn’t be able to finish on time.”
Although the multi-unit apartment portion and infrastructure were completed, the organization now plans to hand off the remaining development of single-family homes to private developers.
Compounding RACDC’s challenges was a phishing attack that cost the organization — and its funders — hundreds of thousands of dollars. Scammers infiltrated the organization’s email system and redirected payments intended for RACDC.
“It was actually a couple of our funders that paid money to scammers,” said Reed. “One of them they caught in time. The other one they didn’t. That was kind of the total loss of confidence at that point.”
The breach, which exploited vulnerabilities in Microsoft’s cloud infrastructure, undermined already-fragile relationships with funding agencies.
“That moment I realized that there was no way we were going to be able to survive,” he said. The scam amounted to a $450,000 loss.
Winding down
At its peak, RACDC employed a full-time staff of eight. Today, all employees are working part-time as the organization wraps up operations. Reed, who stepped in as executive director from the board amid a leadership transition, has been working to ensure that the shutdown proceeds in an orderly fashion.
“My whole goal in this … has been an orderly transition and not a financial crisis,” Reed said. “Some of the other housing groups in the state that have had to merge have been under more dire circumstances, and it’s just not a good way to go”.
In addition to housing, RACDC has administered Randolph’s downtown designation program with financial support from the town and the state’s downtown vibrancy fund. Reed and the RACDC board hope the program can be handed off to a new organization, though the structure and leadership are still being worked out.
“The town gives us $20,000 a year,” Reed said. “We get another $25,000 from the state… but that doesn’t cover the cost of an administrator. It’s probably a $50,000–$60,000 a year expense base that you have to cover.”
Reed has also confirmed that RACDC will liquidate its remaining physical assets — including lots on Maple Street and a few mobile homes — to fund remaining operational expenses. The organization currently has around $1 million in annual revenue, most of which has been tied to project-based funding. Payroll makes up an estimated 75% of day-to-day expenses, Reed said.
Housing remains essential
Despite its closure, Reed emphasized that RACDC’s work will continue in new forms.
“We don’t want to lose the ability to generate affordable housing in Randolph,” Reed said. “The mission is going to continue in some form. It’ll be different people doing it.”
Downstreet Housing is expected to take on some future housing development in the area, though its leadership has acknowledged they won’t be able to match RACDC’s level of activity in Randolph. “They’ve said, no, we are not going to drive housing in Randolph the way you guys have in the last 30 years. We just can’t. But we’ll do what we can,” Reed said.
RACDC’s annual meeting, scheduled for January 28, will serve as a venue for community members and residents to ask questions and learn more about the transition.
“We’re going to lay out to everybody again sort of what’s happening and be available for questions that might come up,” Reed said.

After delaying the vote by one day on Friday, the Idaho Legislature’s Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee voted to adopt the Economic Outlook and Revenue Assessment’s recommended revenue projection of more than $5.6 billion for the current fiscal year 2026 and about $5.8 billion for next year’s fiscal year 2027. 
In both cases, the revenue figures were higher than the revenue projections Little recommended in conjunction with his State of the State address last week. 
JFAC’s adopted revenue total is about $152.5 million, or 2.8% more than Little’s this year, and $137.4 million, or 2.4% more than Little’s next year.
The Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, or JFAC for short, is a powerful legislative committee that sets all of the budgets for every state agency and department. 
 January revenue report for Idaho looks strong

Adopting a revenue figure is an important part of the budget-setting process because the revenue figure essentially represents the upper limit of what can be spent in the state budget. The Idaho Constitution requires the state to pass a balanced budget where expenses do not exceed revenues.

Rep. Josh Tanner, an Eagle Republican who serves as one of the two co-chairs of JFAC, said he felt safe adopting the Economic Outlook and Revenue Assessment Committee’s recommendation because the projection is lower than the Idaho State Tax Commission’s $6.3 billion projection for fiscal year 2027. 
Tanner also referenced a strong new January state monthly revenue report that showed a dramatic increase in corporate income tax collections and now projects the state budget to end the current fiscal year 2026 with a budget surplus of $106.2 million. 
December revenue collections were so strong that they reversed a projected $40 million budget deficit, to the point Idaho is now projecting a budget surplus for the first time in months. 
“So we’re sitting heavy as we sit right now,” Tanner said. 
Although all JFAC members eventually agreed to adopt the same revenue targets unanimously, there was some confusion along the way to reaching agreement. Shortly before voting to adopt the revenue projection, JFAC members voted down an earlier motion to accept the revenue report from the Economic Outlook and Revenue Assessment Committee. 
In the end, different members of JFAC appeared to have different reasons for supporting the higher revenue figure they all agreed to vote for. 
Senate Minority Leader Melissa Wintrow, D-Boise, said she appreciated the more optimistic revenue number because it may mean the Idaho Legislature does not have to cut programs and services as deeply in order to balance the budget.
Sen. Jim Woodward, R-Sagle, said he hopes the higher revenue figure means Idaho will have more money to invest in wildfire suppression and transportation infrastructure. 
Rep. Kyle Harris, R-Lewiston, said he favored the higher revenue target because it leaves more room in the budget for tax cuts and full compliance with federal tax cuts championed by President Donald Trump in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. 
Rep. Rod Furniss, R-Rigby, said after Monday’s meeting adjourned that he favored the higher revenue figure because it gives legislators more of a cushion to leave a larger ending cash balance at the end of the budget year to guard against economic uncertainty. 
This year, JFAC adopted a revenue projection much earlier in the year than during the last two legislative sessions. While Monday marked the eighth day of the 2026 legislative session, JFAC did not adopt a revenue target last year until March 5, which was 59 days into the legislative session. Last year, some members of both political parties criticized JFAC for setting the revenue projection after passing major budgets and tax cuts.

Pat McGeehan, R-Hancock, speaks in support of a bill that would provide condition-based emergency funding to financially distressed counties, including Hancock, which is facing a financial crisis. (Photo by Perry Bennett/West Virginia Legislative Photography)As Hancock County Schools are unable to pay teachers next month due to finances, members of the West Virginia House of Delegates fast-tracked a pair of bills that would allow the county to make payroll.
The full House suspended constitutional rules Monday to swiftly approve two measures related to the school district’s financial debacle, including legislation that would give $8 million to the district so they can pay employees. 
“It’s a lot of uncertainty in Hancock County right now. People that are innocent that are caught up in this, and we really just need to honor obligations, keep those folks paid, [and] make sure schools are open for the rest of the year,” said House Majority Leader Pat McGeehan, who represents the area.
McGeehan, R-Hancock, described the situation as “gross mismanagement” of finances under Hancock County school administration. He said years ago, the district had a more than a million dollar surplus. 
“The state school board has taken them over on Friday, but even if they take all of the school aid formula that they have though June 30 and advance that now, that may not even get them through March,” he said. “The state school board said they’ve never seen anything like it.”
On Friday, the state school board intervened in Hancock County, terminating the superintendent and appointing a replacement. 
The county has been operating with 143 more positions than what the county school aid formula called for, according to the state education department. State officials have said the county used federal COVID-19 relief dollars to cover expenses.
Along with a $5 million cash shortfall, there are numerous ongoing construction projects, including a $1 million turf project.
House Bill 4574, sponsored by McGeehan, would provide condition-based emergency funding to financially distressed counties, like Hancock. It would be available for counties whose reserve funding has fallen below 5% so they can make payroll and continue operating. 
Any school district that receives the funding has to pay it black to the state.
W.Va. House Minority Leader Del. Sean Hornbuckle, D-Cabell
House Minority Leader Sean Hornbuckle, D-Cabell, urged members to pass the bill but said he did so “with caution.” 
“The reason for urgent passage, there are kids involved … Then, there’s also jobs,” Hornbuckle said. “But more importantly, I will recommend to this body, we need to reevaluate also what we have done and what we will do to make sure we are not putting financial hardships on counties, that we are not sitting here yet again, having to make emergency action, because if we do not, we will be here.”
House members overwhelmingly approved the measure. They approved a second bill, House Bill 4575, also sponsored by McGeehan, that would give $8 million to the state Board of Education for Hancock County Schools. The pair of bills were the first to be passed this session by the House, and both measures head to the Senate for consideration.
“I’m optimistic they’ll be taking it up, probably today, but once they get the bill, maybe tomorrow or next day,” McGeehan said.
There are numerous districts under state control, many due to financial issues tied to drying up pandemic relief dollars and West Virginia’s declining population. 
State schools Superintendent Michele Blatt said she believed Hancock County was the only county that would qualify for the emergency funding at this time. She testified before the House Committee on Finance earlier Monday while members initially vetted the school financial relief bills. 
Yearly audits didn’t catch Hancock County’s financial situation, Blatt said, because the county didn’t submit accurate information. 
Additionally, Blatt said the school district’s former chief business officer, who has since been fired, turned off certain triggers within the state’s Education Information System that would have alerted the West Virginia Department of Education about financial issues. The state department of education first learned about the financial crisis in September.
“They were literally putting into WV EIS what they had to for us to see, and not using the full functionality of that plot of that platform,” Blatt told lawmakers. “The system did not have in it what was actually occurring in that county.”
Del. Daniel Linville, R-Cabell
In response, Del. Daniel Linville, R-Cabell, said, “Effectively, you’re telling me they intentionally misled the department.”
Blatt said the department is looking into whether other counties have turned over similar triggers into the information center that could signal financial issues. The department believed that the situation in Hancock County was “an anomaly,” she said.
“This is something that really just … caught all of us off guard,” Blatt said. 
School Board President Paul Hardesty told lawmakers that he expected other counties could be in a similar financial spot as Hancock County.
“If these counties don’t start making the tough cuts, and now that we’ve got this lifeline possibly coming into play, there’ll be others within two, three years, heading your way,” Hardesty said. “You cannot continue to spend money that you do not have. It does not work.”
Blatt said that the education department, which continues to investigate Hancock County’s financial situation, will work with the county prosecutor to determine if possible charges could be brought against local school officials related to financial mismanagement.

Elissa Slotkin speaks at the Samantha Woll Interfaith Roundtable, which she hosted in Lansing on Martin Luther King Jr. Day in Lansing. Jan. 19, 2026. | Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan Advance. U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin is not giving up on working across the aisle, despite becoming the target of federal investigations and the ire of President Donald Trump in the last two months. But she has also drawn some lines in the sand — including voting for any increases to funding for federal law enforcement, specifically ICE, without significant reforms to their behavior. 
“I’m someone who believes we need law enforcement, I’m someone who served in the CIA, so I’m very supportive of, in general, law and order and safety, but that’s not what we have,” she told the Michigan Advance following a roundtable event in Lansing on Monday. “Until they reform themselves, I’m not going to feel comfortable supporting more resources going to them.”
Slotkin became a target of the president, the FBI and, most recently, the Department of Justice, after a November video where she and other members of Congress who are former military and national security officials urged current military servicemembers to “refuse illegal orders.” 
The roundtable event, which included faith leaders from around the state to celebrate Martin Luther King Jr. Day was hosted by Slotkin at the Lansing Regional Chamber of Commerce in honor of Samantha Woll, a Jewish community leader in Detroit who was killed in 2023 while she served as a deputy district director for Slotkin during her time in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Slotkin emphasized the importance of bringing visibility to the violence coming from ICE and other federal law enforcement, in Minnesota and elsewhere.  
“There’s a veil over the eyes of many Americans that’s just like, ‘Well, that’s not happening in my town, in my community, to my family’,” Slotkin said, responding to questions about how to effectively amplify the work being done by faith leaders around the country. “2026 feels like there’s a few more pinpoints in the veil than there was in 2025 and I think the feeling is that this is just going beyond the pale, even for folks who are still very, in many ways, supportive of the president.”

She emphasized again to the Advance how responding to the “well-worn playback on authoritarianism,” a phrasing she has used many times to describe the Trump administration, requires regular Americans to stand up to what they see as crossing an “internal red line for authoritarianism,” as she described it during the roundtable.
“When average people who don’t consider themselves activists or very political people start taking notice and saying, ‘No, that’s not okay,’ that’s when things change,” she said.
“You’re starting to see people who are not activists stand up and say, ‘No, I’m not going to let my country that I love do this.’ And I think that is the playbook for pushing back on this kind of behavior.”
Despite Slotkin’s head-on approach to the Trump administration, she emphasized to the Advance that she would not abandon attempts at bipartisanship in the Senate or in the upcoming Munich Security Conference, which she told the roundtable participants she plans to attend next month.
“If there’s an agriculture bill, or we just put out a bill on ending red tape around permitting reform, those are things where we work very hard across the aisle because they will help real Michiganders. And I’m not going to give up on that,” she said. “There are senators who refuse to do any bipartisan work because of what’s going on, and I’m not one of them, but I think it’s important that everyone just calls balls and strikes on what’s really happening”
One of those pieces of legislation that Slotkin hopes to push through with a bipartisan effort is the National Housing Emergency Act, introduced last month. 
“We drilled down after hearing from a ton of Michiganders on what the real problems were. We are short 4 million units of housing across the country, and that creates a terrible supply and demand problem that drives up prices,” she said. “Even as I deal with things like ICE or uniformed military in our streets, it’s still my job to be responsive to the issues that are affecting every single Michigander.”
But that bill has not garnered support from across the aisle, making it likely to fail in a Congress where the GOP controls both chambers. Still, she emphasized the importance of introducing those kinds of legislation that address the issues she hears from her constituents. 
“Democrats can’t just talk about or criticize the other side,” she added. “What we proposed, I think, should be very non-partisan, right? I’ve heard senators on the other side of the aisle talk about the need for more housing. So I don’t know why they campaigned on it, but they’re not doing anything on it, but that doesn’t obviate my responsibility to do something.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DSC_3727-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-19 16:56:58.032658

It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
Editor’s note: The following is part of a series examining how the success of the Ole Mis football team could provide some solutions to Mississippi’s brain drain.

College football fans in Mississippi will be talking about the 2025-26 season for a long time, no matter what team they support. Ole Miss’s record-setting 13-2 season came to an end in the semifinals of the College Football Playoff.
In a state where potential has historically outstripped performance, the Rebels accomplished what few imagined was possible at the beginning of the season – if ever. The first playoff appearance for a team from Mississippi. The most wins in a season. The highest final regular season ranking since 1962. And – one can only assume – the most Trinidad and Tobago flags ever sold outside of the Caribbean. 
But this season will also be remembered for the topic that has dominated conversation for months among fans and non-fans alike: Mississippi’s brain drain. 
Two days after the Egg Bowl win against rival Mississippi State, Ole Miss coach Lane Kiffin left Mississippi to take the head job at LSU. Despite six years of tweeting #ComeToTheSip, Kiffin felt that Baton Rouge, Louisiana, offered him more opportunity and prestige than Oxford, Mississippi. Nobody has ever departed the state with so much sound and fury, but plenty before him have moved away for similar reasons. In the past 12 years, Mississippi has lost more people to other states than the 68,251 who filled Vaught-Hemingway Stadium for the first-round playoff game against Tulane.  
Kiffin’s departure dramatized the relationship that has always existed between college football and the brain drain. The state’s first intercollegiate game was played in 1893, around the time that Mississippi began losing population to other states. Since that time, Mississippi’s migration history includes long stretches of losing years, punctuated by a few brief periods of success – similar to the records of Mississippi’s major football programs.  
Like the brain drain, college football is a prism for a place’s people, culture and economy. It is a national sport built on local pride, and its symbols and traditions are expressions of communal identity. Cowbells, the Grove, the Sonic Boom and the Fighting Okra encapsulate Mississippi culture as well as whole books written on the subject. 
But beneath the pageantry, college football boils down to a multibillion-dollar competition for talent. The best teams at the end of the season are almost always the teams that recruited the most talent before the season. It is an open competition, but it is not an equal one. Each school’s recruiting ability is determined by the economic and social structures that surround the university: schools with large fanbases and wealthy donors located in talent-rich regions usually draw the best players.
Mississippi is a small state that produces prodigious football talent, but it is divided between two SEC programs and another in the Sun Belt, as well as a trio of SWAC programs. Schools in Mississippi have rarely been able to amass as much talent as their larger and wealthier rivals from more populous states. 
In other words, college football is the brain drain in microcosm. Since most Mississippians follow college football as a matter of birthright, it is the best way to understand why Mississippi loses the talent competition with other states – and what it will take to win.
Top programs and places corner the market on talent 
The 136 schools that play at the highest Division I-FBS level work year-round to recruit and retain as much talent as possible from a limited pool of 18-to-22-year-old players. It is not uncommon for teams to replace half their rosters between seasons while most coaches last only three to four years at the same school. Despite the rapid personnel turnover, college football is the most hierarchical major American sport. Every program has good and bad years, but most have stayed in the same echelon since the era of leather helmets.
The eight schools with the best records since the turn of the 20th century (using Sports Reference’s Simple Rating System, which takes into account strength of schedule and point differential) have won eight of the 11 national championships since the playoff began in 2014. All eight finished in the top 18 of this year’s final regular season rankings. Even in a year that is poised to produce an improbable national champion, a school’s historical performance is the best predictor of how its 2025 team played. 

Places are similarly stratified, even as the people who live in them are changing constantly. Almost two in three people live in a different city than where they grew up, and roughly one-third live in a different state.
Yet most of the wealthiest places half a century ago sit atop of the economic hierarchy today, while most of the poorest places remain on the bottom today. The distribution of places by past and present per capita income resembles the ranking of college football programs. 
a



The top programs and places maintain their preeminence – and prevent the rise of rivals from lower tiers – because the competition for talent is biased in their favor. Five-star prospects go to Ohio State and Alabama for the same reason that the top financiers go to New York and computer scientists go to Silicon Valley: that’s where the best in their fields have always gone. Over time, they have accumulated institutional advantages – more wealth, higher professional ceilings, greater national recognition – that make them attractive destinations for the next generation. 
You don’t have to like Kiffin’s decision to acknowledge that it is easier to follow the well-worn path to success than to try to create it where it has not previously existed.
Mississippi excels at producing talent, not recruiting it
You’ll find Mississippians in the top ranks of nearly every profession, but most had to leave the state to get there. 
Football is the clearest example, in part because it affords us the most complete data. Mississippi produces football talent at a higher rate than any state in the country. Mississippi ranks first per capita in professional football players all-time, active NFL players, Hall of Famers and professional games played. 

By default, every professional football player who grew up in Mississippi left the state for their career. The outmigration of NFL players mirrors the brain drain in other fields. In both cases, Mississippi’s universities are often the launchpad for out-of-state job opportunities. A college education is hardly the only marker of talent, but it is the sharpest dividing line between who stays in Mississippi and who leaves. 
Almost half of Mississippi natives move away after earning a bachelor’s degree, compared to only 30% of Mississippians without a four-year degree. University graduates account for all of the net outmigration from Mississippi since 2010. If football is the rite of fall on campus, the rite of spring is newly-minted graduates packing up to leave Mississippi.
It is no coincidence that the most popular destinations are cities with pro football teams like Dallas, Houston, Atlanta and Nashville. Other top employers are located in those cities for the same reasons as the NFL: that’s where the people and money are. 
Nevertheless, Mississippians are only slightly more likely to leave their home state than other Southerners. What separates Mississippi from nearby states is the ability to recruit newcomers to replace them. For every 100 people born in the average Southern state, 28 move away while 59 move in. Mississippi loses 36 but gains only 26. 
College students are the primary exception. The state’s universities are the best recruiters of talent to the state – in part because of the national exposure from their college football teams. Approximately 4,500 more college students move to Mississippi each year than move away, the 15th-highest rate of net in-migration in the country. In total, about 38% of the enrollment at Mississippi’s eight public universities has come from outside the state.
The football rosters are even more geographically diverse than the campuses at large. Nearly three-quarters of Ole Miss’s team moved from another state, and about 60% of the teams at MSU and USM. More than half of the 77 active NFL players who played at one of Mississippi’s D1 programs were born outside of Mississippi. Most of them chose to play college ball in Mississippi over offers around the country. Twice in the past 13 years, the top high school recruit in the country chose to sign with a Mississippi school: Robert Nkemdiche came to Ole Miss from Georgia in 2013 and Travis Hunter came to JSU from Florida in 2021. 
Student-athletes enroll at Mississippi’s universities for the same reasons as other students: because they offer quality professional development, vibrant social atmospheres and competitive financial packages. Their recruiting success proves that Mississippi is capable of attracting talent from anywhere – as long as it can match the opportunities that exist in other places. 
The brain drain occurs because the opportunities in Mississippi dry up as soon as students graduate. The state ranks last in the share of jobs that require a bachelor’s degree or more. The cost of living is low, but the pay is even lower: college grads take home 10% less in Mississippi than in other Southeastern states even after accounting for price differences. Most of the population lives in rural areas or small towns, which do not appeal to young people seeking big-city amenities or cultural diversity. 
As a result, approximately 95% of out-of-state students leave within five years of graduation, to go along with the nearly half of Mississippi natives. Only two graduates move in from another state for every three who leave. From 2010 to 2020, Mississippi’s colleges and universities jumped from 43rd to 29th in the number of bachelor’s degrees granted per capita, but the share of college-educated 25-to-34-year-olds living in Mississippi dropped from 49th to 50th over the same period. 
A changing recruiting landscape is creating unlikely winners
Only six schools have won national championships in the playoff era. This year will produce the seventh. 
The final four contenders were Indiana, Oregon, Miami and Ole Miss. Only Indiana and Oregon had made a playoff prior to this season, but neither has won a national championship in school history. Miami won its most recent title in 2001, before any of the players on its current team were born. Ole Miss’s last championship (claimed by the school, though not recognized by the NCAA) came in 1962, another season overshadowed by off-field events. 
The common thread among the four semifinalists  is that they have aggressively adapted to the changing recruiting landscape. On the heels of a Supreme Court decision, the NCAA granted players the ability to be paid for their name, image and likeness (NIL) in 2020, followed by the lifting of restrictions on transferring between schools. Revenue sharing now allows schools to pay players directly. 
Players can now move around the country and compare financial offers, just as workers in other sectors have always been able to do. In the new era, recruiting talent has less to do with a program’s pedigree than its budget. The four semifinalists all have well-funded and well-organized NIL collectives that have allowed them to land talented transfers. While blue-bloods Georgia, Ohio State, Alabama still build their rosters through the high school ranks, more than half of the starters at Miami, Indiana and Ole Miss have come out of the portal. In the first two rounds of this year’s playoff, the team that started more transfers was 6-1 (Oregon and James Madison had an equal share). 
The changing landscape has not upended the established hierarchy – after all, blue-blood programs typically still have the largest fan bases and deepest pockets – but it has created new opportunities for upward mobility among programs that can raise enough money and invest it wisely.  
Broader societal and economic changes in wake of the pandemic have also shifted the migration of talent among the general population. Many of the largest and wealthiest cities began losing residents in 2020 as knowledge workers took advantage of their newfound ability to work remotely. Housing costs had been growing for decades in the nation’s top talent hubs, and COVID-era inflation brought affordability to a breaking point. In response, young professionals have flocked to smaller cities that offer many of the same urban amenities at a fraction of the price. 
According to Zillow, the nation’s hottest housing markets in 2025 were Buffalo, New York; Indianapolis, Indiana; Providence, Rhode Island; and Hartford, Connecticut. All have historically been second- or third-tier cities in their regions. Three of the four had lost population since 1970. 
As in college football, the established hierarchy remains intact, but with more potential for upward mobility. Talent still tends to flow in the direction of the cities with the biggest economies and highest-paid jobs, but the changes since 2020 have created opportunities to redirect more talent to places that previous generations had left behind. 
Ole Miss built one of the nation’s best football teams because it figured out how to use the changing landscape to its advantage. As a state, Mississippi has not yet followed suit.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-19 20:00:37+00:00,CT Mirror,Report: Federal cuts deepening food insecurity in Connecticut,Theo Peck-Suzuki,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/19/ct-food-insecurity-federal-cuts/,"CT plans to spend roughly $27.6 million more on food insecurity through FY27, but federal spending could drop $180 million over that time.","Food insecurity is rising in Connecticut, and the problem is likely to keep getting worse amid major cuts to federal food programs, according to a report released Friday by the Commission on Women, Children, Seniors, Equity & Opportunity.
The report noted that Connecticut has the highest rate of food insecurity in New England (14.3%, according to the most recent data from Feeding America) and trails many of its neighbors in spending to combat the problem. Although the state is projected to spend roughly $27.6 million more on food insecurity through fiscal year 2027, those increases are dwarfed by the loss of over $180 million in federal spending over that same period.
Specific losses include: 

The termination of the SNAP-ED program, which educates SNAP recipients on how to cook healthy meals and achieve physically active lifestyles; 
An increased administrative cost share for SNAP,  which begins in fiscal year 2027
Significant restrictions on SNAP-LIHEAP, which provides food and heating assistance to low-income households
The cancellation of certain bonus loads from TFAP (federal Emergency Food Assistance Program)
The termination of the LFPA (federal Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement Program), which purchased food for food banks from local farmers
The termination of the LFS (federal Local Food for Schools Cooperative Agreement Program), which purchased food for schools from local farmers

An additional $133 million loss is projected for 2028, which is when cost sharing for SNAP benefits themselves will begin. That’s how much the state will have to pay if its SNAP error rate — that is, how accurately the state calculates eligibility and benefits — remains unchanged. Based on that number, the report puts the total decrease in federal food spending for Connecticut in fiscal year 2028 at over $243 million.
Although inflation is not included in those calculations, the report notes grocery store inflation remained at 3% in 2025, likely putting further pressure on families’ food budgets.

The dramatic loss of funding is one reason the report’s primary recommendation this year is to establish a special fund to support food and nutrition programs statewide. The report envisions the fund working like others already in existence for tourism, insurance and transportation. 
The report suggests a handful of potential funding sources. One involves removing sales tax exemptions from certain extremely unhealthy foods and beverages and dedicating the revenue from items already taxed to the fund. Others include dedicating revenue from the 1% prepared meals surcharge; expanding the luxury tax to include high-value food and drink; and an excise tax on sugar-sweetened beverage distributors.
Creating a fund might help Connecticut catch back up to its New England peers, some of which are significantly out-spending the state already. According to the report, Connecticut spends a total of $14.81 per capita on food across 51 programs. By comparison, Vermont spends $28.53 per capita across just its three top programs, while Massachusetts spends $35.03 per capita, also across three programs.

Rep. Gary Turco, D-Newington, said he was “ashamed” by those numbers and expressed support for the idea of a special fund to combat food insecurity.
“We have a special transportation fund. We believe transportation’s really important, right? People need to be able to get to work and school and things like that, so we have a dedicated revenue stream that goes into that that is not part of our spending cap. Why isn’t food as important?” he said during the presentation of the report.
The report also includes three new recommendations to specifically improve food and nutrition knowledge, the lack of which contributes significantly to food insecurity. 
“These are things that we think would cost little or no money but would help promote access to information for these families who currently have barriers to that,” said CWCSEO’s Christian Duborg.
One of these includes establishing an official methodology for collecting food insecurity data at the state level. The data in the report comes from a mix of sources including Feeding America, DataHaven and the USDA, not from the state government.
“There’s a lot of data at the federal level that is either not measured at all, has been stopped — they’re stopping measuring, or is rarely updated,” Duborg said. An official state data collection process could help fix that, he said.
The other two recommendations are to develop new labeling requirements for food content to establish a holistic food education roadmap for the state. This would involve creating model policies and curricula for K-12 schools and reconstituting SNAP-ED at the state level.
While strong food and nutrition education is “necessary” to combat food insecurity, Duborg said, it must be paired with food benefits to actually address the problem.
Rep. Jaime Foster, D-East Windsor, was one of a handful of state legislators at the presentation who suggested tapping into a $500 million pool the state set aside to offset federal cuts.
That money could be used to “reinstate programs like SNAP education … or address SNAP cuts or groups that are disproportionately impacted by changes in SNAP,” Foster said. “And then during session, we can renew our efforts on expanding programs that we know are meeting critical gaps in our system.”
Jacob Jakubowski of Connecticut Foodshare said he’s glad elected officials in Connecticut are actively looking for solutions and told presentation attendees the situation is grave.
“We can’t forget what just happened a couple of months ago [during the government shutdown],” Jakubowski said. “The SNAP crisis was the biggest threat to people facing food insecurity at least in my lifetime here in this country.”
Jakubowski said last year’s pause in SNAP benefits has caused “permanent damage” to the food security system.
“There’s people we’re finding right now, they don’t want to sign up for SNAP because they think SNAP is going away,” Jakubowski said.
Jakubowski also called attention to changes in TFAP, a federal program that provides food to food banks and pantries. In the first quarter of 2025, his organization got 84 truckloads of food from TFAP; in the first quarter of 2026, the projection is 26 loads. That means less food for food banks and pantries at a time when SNAP benefits are also likely to shrink.
Sen. Matthew Lesser, D-Cromwell, said pressures on food providers and constituents have been growing since the loss of COVID-era funding and said the passage of HR-1, also known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, has exacerbated those challenges.
Lesser also pointed out that “as recently as 2017, the state operated our own food security program … that we have now walked away from.”
“I think it really makes sense for us to sort of think creatively about what our role is in ensuring food security to our neighbors at a time when the federal government just is not a reliable partner,” Lesser said.
Duborg was frank about the scale of the challenge facing Connecticut.
“I wish I could say that if you adopt this, the problem will go away. I am not nearly arrogant enough to believe that I’ve figured out the answer. But the one thing that we do know is that doing nothing is causing a lot of harm, and while every option has drawbacks, very few options will have as many drawbacks as allowing food insecurity and nutrition insecurity to continue impacting our residents unabated,” Duborg said. 
He continued, “Residents will get sicker, students will have a harder time learning, families will struggle at work, and all of these impacts come with major financial costs to the state. So, by investing in food security through these recommendations, we believe that Connecticut can not only support its residents and improve quality of life for years to come but also make good investments that will also make the state fiscally stronger going into the future.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/FOOD-PANTRY-0711-DE-047-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-19 15:57:11.947104

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)After the dissolution of the state’s third-largest political party, the Alaska Division of Elections is sending out notices to the 19,117 members of the former Alaskan Independence Party, warning them to update their voter information.
“In the coming weeks, the DOE will inform the voters registered as affiliated with the AIP that the party is no longer recognized,” the department said in a notice published Wednesday. “These voters will have the option to select a new party or group affiliation if they wish. If they do not update their registration — by phone, email, in person, or through the online form — within 30 days of receipt, the Division plans to change their registration status to ‘undeclared.’”
The Alaskan Independence Party’s leadership formally dissolved the organization in a vote on Dec. 7, then released a statement at the end of the year about the decision.
That statement said the party elected a new board of directors in April 2024, and that board analyzed the state of the party.
“The board carried out its work and found that the current party membership is either apathetic to the goals of the party, believes that the party is a branch of the Republican party, or is registered to the AIP by mistake,” the statement said in part.
“The party has for some time been legally alive yet spiritually dead,” the statement said.
The AIP’s origins date to the early 1970s, when interior Alaska gold miner Joe Vogler attempted to rally opposition to federal land control after statehood.
Vogler ran for governor as an independent in 1974, and the AIP developed out of his Libertarian-like vision for the state — local control, limited government, and a new statewide referendum on whether Alaska should be a state, commonwealth, territory or fully independent.
For decades, AIP members contended that Alaska’s 1958 statehood vote was not valid because it did not present Alaskans with a full set of options.
The party peaked in 1990, when conservative Republicans abandoned their support of Sen. Arliss Sturgulewski for governor, who they deemed too moderate on abortion and environmental issues.
Former Republican Gov. Wally Hickel replaced John Lindauer on the AIP’s gubernatorial ticket, and Sturgulewski’s lieutenant governor candidate, Jack Coghill, defected to serve as Hickel’s lieutenant governor candidate.
Hickel and Coghill won the three-way election with just under 39% of the vote, marking the AIP’s sole statewide electoral win. 
That was the party’s high-water mark; Hickel governed as a Republican in all but name and rejoined the Republican party before his term ended. 
Vogler was murdered in 1993, and the party became an annual also-ran in statewide races. In 2024, when John Wayne Howe ran as the party’s candidate for U.S. House, he received just 4% of Alaskans’ first-choice votes.

(Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)New Jersey will have some of the strictest regulations on electric bikes in the nation under a bill Gov. Phil Murphy signed into law Monday.
The new law will require registration, licensing, and insurance for electric bikes, and it also does away with the three-tier system the state formerly used to classify them.
The new law, which also bans online e-bike sales for one year, comes after a series of fatal crashes involving e-bikes, including one that left a 13-year-old boy in Scotch Plains dead last year. Murphy, who leaves office Tuesday, said in a statement that the increasing popularity of e-bikes “requires us to take action and update regulations that help prevent tragedies from occurring.”
Paid family leave expands to more workers under new law

Bill sponsor Senate President Nick Scutari (D-Union) said the “dramatic increase” in faster and more powerful e-bikes has become dangerous.
“Their popularity with young people, coupled with their inexperience as operators, puts them at greater risk. We are in a new era of e-bike use that requires updated safety standards to help prevent accidents, injuries, and fatalities,” he said. “Requiring registration and licensing will improve their safe use and having them insured will protect those injured in accidents.”
The bill was heavily opposed by transportation groups and bike advocates. They called the legislation too restrictive for everyday e-bike riders and said it would disproportionately harm immigrant and low-income riders who rely on them for work.
“New Jersey has ambitious climate goals and a dire need to reduce traffic fatalities. We should be encouraging the shift toward sustainable, lightweight electric transportation, not building barriers against it,” said Zoe Baldwin of the Regional Plan Association.
Under the new law, “low-speed electric bikes” refers to bikes with an electric motor that cease to assist once the rider reaches 20 miles per hour; “motorized bikes” means bikes with a throttle that max out at 28 miles per hour; and “electric motorized bicycles” includes two-wheel pedaled vehicles with an electric motor that can exceed 28 miles per hour. Low-speed e-bikes and motorized bikes will now require licensing, insurance, and registration (they were already required for electric motorized bicycles).
The bill moved quickly in recent weeks, advancing out of both houses of the Legislature during its final voting session last week.
E-bike owners will have six months to meet the new licensing, registration, and insurance requirements. Licensing and registration fees will be waived for one year.
Minors under the age of 15 will be banned from operating low-speed e-bikes or motorized bicycles, and a 17-year-old is required to have a basic driver’s license to drive an e-bike. The law allows 16-year-olds to rent low-speed electric bikes that are part of a contract with local governments, like CitiBike.
The law also bans the sale of modification kits to turn a low-speed e-bike into a motorized bicycle, and for one year, the sale of electric motorized bikes online.

It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
Notes, quotes and an opinion or three:
The educated guess here is that Trinidad Chambliss will be the starting quarterback for Ole Miss when the Rebels open the 2026 season against Louisville at Nashville on either Sept. 5 or 6.
Rick Cleveland
Yes, I know, the NCAA has denied Chambliss’s initial request for a sixth year of eligibility. But Ole Miss has appealed that decision, and Chambliss has petitioned for both temporary and permanent restraining orders against the NCAA. That case will be heard in the Chancery Court of Lafayette County, about a mile from Vaught-Hemingway Stadium and a decided home field advantage for Chambliss and Ole Miss.
Lose there – as we presume the NCAA will – and the NCAA could appeal to the the Mississippi Supreme Court. Not exactly the most neutral of sites, either.
A decision on the temporary restraining order could come as early as this week.  Should the TRO be granted, the legal process to decide the permanent restraining order could take weeks or even months and possibly not be decided until 2027, by which time Chambliss will be preparing for the NFL Draft.
There is also a chance that the NCAA will regroup, consider the likelihood of losing in Mississippi courts (and the cost involved there) and grant the Ole Miss appeal in the near future. 
Either way, Chambliss and Ole Miss win.
•••
Should Chambliss be allowed to play another season of college football? Your answer depends on your allegiance. But consider this: Carson Beck was leading Miami into Monday night’s national championship game in his sixth year of college football. We don’t know if Beck, a multimillionaire at 23, will take the team bus to Hard Rock Stadium or make the short drive over in his Lamborghini.
We do know that Beck has made sort of a mockery of the education element of college football during the lead-up to the national championship game against Indiana. Beck graduated from the University of Georgia in 2023. Asked last week if he had attended classes at Miami in the week leading up to the game, Beck responded, “No class. I graduated two years ago.”
Meanwhile, Indiana will be quarterbacked by Heisman winner Fernando Mendoza, a mere 22-year-old who graduated from the University of California last year and has one year of college eligibility remaining. Mendoza is expected to forego that final year of eligibility to likely be the first pick of the upcoming NFL Draft.
You ask me, the best way to prevent these seemingly endless eligibility issues is to give college athletes five years to complete their careers. That would be five years to play as many as five seasons. You could solve other problems by allowing for only one transfer during those five years.

Don’t look now, but Ole Miss is starting to play basketball the way we have become accustomed to Chris Beard-coached teams playing. The Rebels won their third straight game Saturday night, edging Mississippi State 68-67 at Starkville. The victory lifted Ole Miss to 11-7 overall and 3-2 in the SEC, good for a seven-way tie for third place and only one game out of first. State dropped to 10-8, 2-3.
Just goes to show you how fast things can change in the SEC. Ten days ago Ole Miss was 0-2 and in last place. Ten days ago, Mississippi State was 2-0 and tied for first.
Ole Miss plays host to Auburn at 8 p.m. Tuesday. State plays at Texas A&M Wednesday night at 8. 
Five games into the SEC schedule, the league has never seemed more balanced. Thirteen of the 16 teams are within two games of first place.

Irrigators reject accusation of $1.6M “conflict of interest” payment for reservoir they say will allow profitable crops in Hyattville.
The post Mounting dam costs include moving private landing strip appeared first on WyoFile .","As debate over rising cost estimates for the proposed Alkali Creek Dam continues, one critic asserts that the sponsoring water district is entangled in a conflict of interest after paying a board member $1.6 million.
A neighbor to the proposed dam site is upset that the Nowood Watershed Improvement District paid the Paint Rock Angus Ranch — owned by the Martin Mercer family — the hefty sum for land and easements while Martin Mercer sat on the district board.
Tim Gardiner, owner of the Twisted Tippet Ranch that lies just below the proposed dam site, called the payment “a massive conflict of interest,” involving “good old boy” politicking.
“We’ve got the president and vice president [of the Nowood district] crafting their own deal,” Gardiner said. “It’s a lot of money without the light-of-day overview.”
Mercer and Nowood District President John Joyce rejected the allegation, saying the 35-member association is small, doesn’t have a lot of board candidates and is following its charter.
“Nobody has run against me,” Mercer said of board elections. He signed up for board duty because, “I always felt I could bring something to the table.”
“We followed all the rules”martin Mercer
Irrigators anticipated spending the state funds to buy reservoir property, and studies determined that Mercer’s land was the bestideal site.
“We followed all the rules,” Mercer said. “Everything was voted on by our peers. It’s been transparent. It’s been democratic.
“I don’t know there’s any conflict of interest.”
Joyce agreed with Mercer but said he realizes the optics are bad.
Despite public perception, he said, “it’s been done correctly and above board.”
Five times more
As Wyoming advances plans to construct the dam, lawmakers are increasingly alarmed by cost estimates that have climbed from $20 million to more than $100 million even before a spade of dirt has been turned.
The state of Wyoming would pay for all but about $2 million of the 100-foot-high, half-mile-long earth embankment. The dam would hold a 9,000-acre-foot reservoir to provide 6,000 acre-feet of supplemental irrigation to 35 irrigating families.

Some of the anticipated expenses are understandable for a reservoir that would cover 312 acres. A contract for just some of the required dirt carries a nearly $900,000 price tag.
As engineers worked on the project, they discovered the dirt, or fill, they had counted on for the structure would not meet the specifications. So they would need more, would have to truck it farther and would have to make the dam larger than originally planned.
Engineers also found another costly problem.
A porous geologic formation under the dam site proved to be an issue. It would require grouting — injection of cement underground — to seal off any potential leaks.
Another hiccup came when some neighbors questioned why they should provide easements for an undertaking they didn’t consider a benefit. To bring them on board, water developers may have to spend more than anticipated to upgrade a principal feeder canal, and even bury it in a pipeline.
Wyoming may also buy pivot irrigation systems for neighbors, a conservation expense that’s an exception to state policy.
Then there is inflation, supply-chain challenges and other unseen developments in a shifting economic environment.
And the expense of relocating a private airstrip.
A private airstrip
The dam and reservoir would make a private airstrip on Mercer’s ranch inoperable. So plans call for relocating it, along with “an existing metal building … used as an aircraft hangar.”

Water developers “will accommodate the proposed [replacement] airstrip in the Project design and construction, including performing rough grading for 1,200 feet of airstrip,” according to a legal agreement between the Mercer ranch and the Nowood district. The water district will also pay Mercer and the ranch $140,400 to build a replacement hangar and supply it with a water line.
The Wyoming Water Development Office looked at 41 sites before settling on the Mercer ranch. Developers believed that locating a new reservoir on the nearby Bighorn National Forest or even property managed by the Bureau of Land Management “is not something that would be successful,” Joyce told WyoFile.
Consultants compared the fees, delays and other aspects of dealing with federal agencies to buying Mercer property and easements, moving the airstrip and more, Joyce said.
“All that was put on paper,” he said. “It was just math at that point.”
Mercer added that the project “wound up landing here as far as being cost-effective.”
Gardiner is also upset because the Water Development Commission and the Nowood district paid for the Mercer property before they had all the necessary easements secured. Wyoming officials have said they would not condemn private property for the dam, only secure easements on a willing-seller basis.
But some landowners, Gardiner included, are holding out for assurances that will protect their property. Gardiner, for example, wants the reservoir flows moved away from his house, other design improvements and insurance against a potential flood.

Others want an enlarged Anita Ditch, which would feed the reservoir, buried in a pipe, a costly proposition. The Water Development Office would install pivot irrigation sprinklers to aid those who won’t directly benefit from reservoir flows.
The Mercer purchase was putting the cart before the horse and putting taxpayer funds at risk, Gardiner said. The proper course would have been to secure options — legal agreements for easements and land purchases that are contingent upon first securing all necessary project elements. Only then should money have been spent, he said.
Now, state funds are in danger of being stranded if the project collapses, Gardiner said.
He also accused the state of “poor financial management,” arguing that money that’s now sitting idle should instead have been accruing interest.
Over-adjudicated
A fifth-generation rancher, Mercer said the Nowood drainage has been “over-adjudicated” — that the state allocated rights to more water than was available. “We learned how to live being short of water,” he said.
“They always figured on a reservoir,” he said of area settlers. Instead, ranchers and farmers now watch spring runoff flow by, then scratch what they can out of Alkali, Paint Rock and Medicine Lodge creeks.

“As much water as goes by in the spring, you just dream of a chance like this,” Mercer said.
When first envisioned by a steering committee, a reservoir was estimated to cost as little as $15 million to $20 million, Joyce said. Now, legislators say a $100-million-plus price tag puts the acre-foot cost in the stratosphere.
It’s unfair to compare today’s dam projects with those in the heyday of water development decades ago, Water Development Office Director Jason Mead told water officials in November. Major on-channel dams that block rivers, “you just can’t build those anymore,” he said.
As a result, “you really don’t get the economy of scale … like you did back in the ’50s and earlier,” he said.
Also, storage projects now consider needs on a watershed scale, Mead said, which means addressing wildlife, irrigation efficiency, water quality, fisheries, recreation and other factors. The reservoir would always have at least a 132-acre pool for recreation.
The 6,000 acre-feet of stored water would be used as “supplemental irrigation” to ensure and boost crop yields, Joyce said.
“This area has very little rain — five to six inches [of] moisture all year,” he said. “Everything we grow is irrigated. When the snow melts, we’re done.”
That limits the types of crops that ranchers and farmers can grow. With more water, crops that are more valuable than livestock grass can be cultivated. “Corn, beets and alfalfa are more profitable,” Joyce said.
The dam fits with Wyoming’s overall plan to take earnings from the one-time extraction of resources like coal and invest them in renewable endeavors like water storage, ranching and farming, Joyce has said.
Heart of the ranch
For Mercer, the decision to sell part of his family ranch was wrenching. Homesteading family members in the late 1800s “sacrificed to own this piece of ground,” he said.
“It’s not easy to sell the heart of your operation,” he said. “Not everybody is excited in the Mercer family.”
The next generation of Mercers who are involved in the Paint Rock Ranch business gives him hope, he said.
“That sums up Wyoming,” he said. “Any kid you can keep in the state is a plus.”

While Securix cameras no longer record license plates to cite uninsured vehicle owners, the Mississippi Department of Transportation has a live traffic camera at the intersection and there's a Flock camera for public safety.","The audio version of this story is AI generated and is not human reviewed. It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
A Chancery Court judge has agreed to dissolve a partnership formed to profit from uninsured motorists whose license plates were captured by traffic cameras in Ocean Springs, Biloxi and other Mississippi cities. 
A politically prominent trio of Mississippians formed QJR LLC to run the uninsured motorist program in Mississippi with Jonathan Miller, chairman of Georgia-based Securix LLC. Miller and his company have a proprietary system that randomly checks license plate numbers against state databases to identify uninsured vehicles and ticket their owners through law enforcement agencies.
Miller and Securix started the program in Ocean Springs, signing a contract in May 2021 with the city. Miller then teamed up with QJR, whose members are Quinton Dickerson and Josh Gregory of Frontier Strategies advertising firm in the metro Jackson area, plus attorney Robert Wilkinson of Pascagoula. 
Frontier manages high-profile state and local political campaigns, while Wilkinson was city attorney for Ocean Springs when the partners formed Securix Mississippi to spread the potentially profitable program to more cities and states. Miller was supposed to manage the technology, while an operating agreement between his company and QJR stipulated that only QJR would handle marketing and direct contact with Mississippi customers.
Motorist ticketing program unravels 
The partnership began to unravel within a month, Josh Gregory testified in Chancery Court before Judge Harris. Miller failed to show up for the trial. He was representing himself after Harris excused Miller’s attorney from the case in October, when the attorney-client relationship had completely broken down.
 QJR filed its lawsuit against Miller and Georgia Securix in September 2024, asking that Harris dissolve Securix Mississippi and order Miller to stop defaming QJR and its members and levy punitive damages against him. The lawsuit was sealed for more than a year, although Harris did not follow established procedure for removing the case from public view. He unsealed most, but not all, records in the case after statewide media company Mississippi Today, later joined by the Sun Herald, objected to the sealing. 
Harris decided that Securix Mississippi bank records would remain sealed — again without establishing a need to prevent public access to the entire bank record. 
By the time QJR filed its lawsuit, the state Department of Public Safety had cut off Securix Mississippi’s access to the database of uninsured motorists after receiving at least one complaint from Miller about how Securix Mississippi was operating. 
Gregory testified that Miller was not supposed to be communicating with public officials, according to their operating agreement. He said Securix Mississippi had ceased operations by 2025 and has no remaining assets. The company had previously pulled in $1.3 million in a year, according to records in a federal case that motorists filed in August 2023 against Georgia Securix.
MS partner testifies about Securix 
Gregory testified that Miller was spreading false rumors of criminal wrongdoing against him and QJR. Miller sent emails and letters to public officials, including Public Safety Commissioner Sean Tindell, and others. Miller claimed QJR was misusing sensitive personal information about vehicle owners that only law enforcement officers were supposed to access. 
“Pretty much everything he wrote, via email, letter or post, was untrue,” Gregory testified. “ . . . If he didn’t get his way, he would send email after email, to the point that we had to block his emails. They were excessive.”
 Gregory said that QJR had attempted to keep Miller out of day-to-day operations in Mississippi because the program Miller and Georgia Securix ran in Ocean Springs was “such a disaster.” One of Miller’s later allegations was that Wilkinson was involved in the Ocean Springs program and shared in its profits, which Gregory testified was “completely untrue.” 
Commissioner Tindell pulled Securix access to the uninsured motorist database in August 2023, court records show, after a letter from Miller alleged the program was being mismanaged. 
Gregory testified that Miller did not provide documentation of the wrongdoing that he alleged. 
Judge Harris has found Miller in contempt of court multiple times, but Miller has not returned to Mississippi and still owes more than $63,603 in attorney’s fees that Harris ordered the businessman to pay QJR’s attorney, Jaklyn Wrigley. Harris ordered the fees paid after finding that Miller had wrongly tried to move QJR’s case to federal court. The federal judge sent the case back to Harris.
In addition to dissolving Securix Mississippi, Harris also could consider QJR’s request for punitive damages against Miller and Georgia Securix, along with other relief QJR is seeking. 
“While the other side did not show up for court yet again, we continued to provide the facts about this matter and are glad to be moving toward the resolution we’ve been advocating for since the start of this process more than a year ago,” said Jaklyn Wrigley, attorney for QJR.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/18161106/Securix-traffic-intersection.jpg,,,2026-01-19 13:57:10.431154

But when she found out she’d need three separate permits — one to grow, one to ship plants in or out, and one to sell plants grown somewhere else — she was overwhelmed by the paperwork each permit required and the more than 150 pages of rules that came with them.

“We got enough together to buy our own property and build our own building. And we were so excited. We thought the sky was the limit,” Nicholls said. “The sky’s not the limit. The rules and regulations are the limit. You can only go as far as they let you go. There are license after license on the books.”
Wouldn’t it be easier, she thought, if state regulators combined them into a single certification.
“They dollar you to death,” Nicholls said. “Five here, five there, 10 here, 15 there.”
That’s why Nicholls and others are pushing for legislation to increase scrutiny of the state’s more than 80,000 regulations.
More oversight
State law already provides for oversight of the rules state agencies put on businesses operating in the Palmetto State. But the South Carolina chapter of Americans for Prosperity believes legislators should do more to ensure they actually review them.
Getting the bill, which passed the House unanimously last March, through the Senate and across the governor’s desk is the top priority of the political advocacy group founded in 2004 by libertarian billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch.
At top of mind for the group is making sure legislators sign off on any costly regulations.
Legislators are supposed to give final approval to all agency regulations, minus those required by federal law. But there’s a loophole.
If the General Assembly neither approves nor denies a rule within 110 days, it takes effect automatically. That’s what happened in 2024 with the Department of Education’s regulation on age-appropriate books in schools. Senators were incensed it skipped their review entirely. Last year, legislators voted unanimously on a law to automatically pause the clock on regulatory reviews from mid-May to mid-January while they’re not in session. The law also shortened the total days, from 120 to 110.
Americans for Prosperity wants to stop automatic approvals altogether for any regulation that boosts business expenses. Under the bill, if the estimated cost to businesses across an industry exceeds $1 million over a five-year period, legislators would have to take an up-or-down vote.
Six of the 77 regulations automatically approved in the last seven years would have been subject to the $1 million threshold, according to the group’s state director, Matt Humm.
In Nicholls’ case, the annual cost of the permits she needed vary by the size of the business — ranging from free for small operations to $300 for a large one. The cost of shipping plants in and out varies based on the number of plants transported — $17 for a batch of 25 or $280 for 10,000 plants.
That doesn’t include costs she might face for things like pest or disease control. Stopping their spread is the primary concern of those regulations.
One in, two out
State law requires other layers of review before any proposed change to a regulation gets to the Legislature, including public hearings and a fiscal impact analysis.
And existing rules must go back before legislators for re-approval every five years. Still, Humm said, outdated regulations tend to linger and don’t always keep pace with modern technological advancements.
The legislation combats that with a pair of blanket requirements meant to cut the overall number of regulations. One calls for a 25% reduction in the number of regulations each type of small business faces.
The second is a two-for-one provision, forcing agencies to cut to rules for each new one they propose.

It’s a measure Kathleen Stevens supports.
“I’m not saying we don’t need them. I’m just saying we don’t need all of them,” she said. “There’s just garbage on the books.”
While raising her sons, Stevens ran a side business painting and restoring furniture. After her children graduated, she decided she wanted to open a space where other small craft and antique vendors like her could hawk their wares in downtown Chester.
She opened Rainbow Rooster Boutique four years ago with plans of operating a small cafe in the back of the store.
“I just wanted to serve a little coffee and pastries,” Stevens said.
The cafe space remains empty, she said, because she doesn’t have the money to install all the equipment regulators told her she needed. She pulled the application. 
“I was overwhelmed,” she said. 
‘Lose our entrepreneurship’
Business owners including Nicholls, Stevens and Zack Holt say they’re not opposed to regulations, but they want reassurances that they’re up to date and absolutely necessary.
When Holt purchased an existing restaurant space in Hartsville a couple of years ago for a new location of Holt Bros BBQ, state highway regulators told him the sign that had been in place under previous ownership was too close to the state road.
While Holt didn’t put it there, the state still required him to move it. That, along with permitting delays at the city level, held up his grand opening for nine months, he said.
“That’s nine months’ worth of lost revenue and income,” he said.
And he had to send the new employees he had hired to work at other locations.
Americans for Prosperity and the small business owners it’s representing argue small companies don’t have the same financial wherewithal as big ones to comply with these rules.
“We’re going to lose our entrepreneurship to large corporations,” Stevens said.
Still, state law has had carveouts in place since 2004 meant to address that as well.
When a new rule has a big impact on small businesses, it must go before a special, 11-member committee housed at the state Department of Commerce and made up of small business owners. Part of that process must include financial studies and plans by agencies to reduce the burden on those business owners or exempt them from the rule altogether.
The proposed law would require the same cost-benefit analyses for all new and re-approved regulations. It would also send that information to more people, including the small business panel, for review.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/5C9F5BD9-47B0-47FC-AF5B-6742DE67478C_1_201_a.jpeg,,,2026-01-19 12:57:03.516501

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)The prospective buyer of Roger Williams Medical Center and Our Lady of Fatima Hospital missed the final, court-ordered deadline to close the deal, leaving the fate of the two safety net hospitals in the hands of the state.
Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha confirmed in a statement on Saturday that The Centurion Foundation failed to meet the Jan. 15 deadline to cement its purchase of the two hospitals in Providence and North Providence. The due date was set under a Dec. 9 agreement between Neronha’s office and the attorneys representing the bankruptcy estate for their existing owner Prospect Medical Holdings. 
Buyer of Roger Williams, Fatima hospitals ‘will work like expletive deleted to get this done’

The missed deadline now puts the onus on the state to take over hospital operations — and pay for the costs associated with payroll, taxes and insurance — by Jan. 30, as laid out in the December agreement. Neronha hinted previously that a court-appointed state receivership was possible if the Centurion deal fell through, but provided little detail.
“Centurion is free to continue to try to close, but we now have work to do and a deadline by which to do it,” Neronha said in an email Saturday afternoon. “My Office is working hard in consultation with other state leaders and I expect you will hear more about that next week.”
Preserving the pair of hospitals — with 500 beds, 50,000 annual emergency room visits and nearly 2,500 employees between them — has been a top focus of Neronha’s office, and, as scrutiny over the sale intensifies, Rhode Island officials more broadly. But none have put a price tag — at least publicly — on what the state is willing to pay to keep the hospitals running.
Gov. Dan McKee’s proposed fiscal 2027 budget, unveiled on Thursday, one day before the Jan 15 deadline, did not include any money for the hospitals. 
Meanwhile, Centurion appears not to have given up, still courting the investor-backed bonds needed to finalize its purchase.
“We are keenly aware of the bankruptcy court timetable,” Ben Mingle, Centurion CEO and president, said in a statement Friday night. “Our financing team…has had daily interactions with potential investors over the last several weeks with significant progress. This includes site visits by new, industry-leading investment groups just this week with very encouraging results. At the same time, we have been briefing State leaders almost daily on the status of these efforts and our plans to meet the bond sale target. The Team remains optimistic and we hope to provide a formal update next week.”
It’s a familiar promise for those following the yearslong saga of the local hospitals, where operational and financial mismanagement under Prospect and its former majority stakeholder, private equity firm Leonard Green, were well-documented.
The Centurion Foundation appeared to be a way out. The Atlanta nonprofit pledged to return the cash-strapped health care facilities to local control while injecting $80 million into immediate operations under the terms of the state’s June 2024 conditional approval. 
But investors have been reluctant to back the bonds needed for Centurion to close, with credit rating agencies’ noting Centurion’s lack of experience in hospital ownership and the dismal outlook for health care facilities nationwide amid federal funding cuts.
The prolonged state of limbo frustrated hospital workers, health care advocates and public officials. But it proved most problematic for the more than 100,000 creditors owed up to $10 billion collectively from Prospect at the time it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January 2025. The bankruptcy estate initially signaled a desire to close the hospitals in October, but an interim agreement with funding partially provided by a state-controlled escrow account kept the doors open through Jan. 30.
But as of that date, the hospitals are coming off Prospect’s asset list, with all liabilities, costs and responsibilities transferred to the state of Rhode Island.
How the state will afford its new guardian duties is unclear.
Rhode Island officials have been on high alert for the pending sale, with Senate President Valarie Lawson calling it “the most pressing issue facing Rhode Island” in an interview after McKee’s State of the State address on Jan. 13. McKee briefly addressed the hospitals during the hourlong speech, pledging his administration will “do everything in our power” to keep the hospitals open.
Neronha and union leaders with the United Nurses and Allied Professionals, which represents more than 1,500 workers across both hospitals, have criticized McKee for failing to proactively take control of the uncertain situation, contrasting his leadership with Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey. 
Healey in 2024 offered a multimillion dollar state incentive package to entice buyers — including Brown University Health — after Steward Health Care filed for bankruptcy and sold its Massachusetts facilities. 
Brian Daniels, director for the Rhode Island Office of Management and Budget, said Thursday the governor’s administration was working closely with Neronha’s office and the state Executive Office of Health and Human Services on “contingency planning.”
“We are monitoring what happens,” Daniels said. “We have some ideas.”

(Photo courtesy of DNR nest monitoring volunteer, Randy Cook)Peregrine falcon reproduction in Iowa “likely remains stable” following successful reintroduction efforts in the 1990s, but the Iowa Department of Natural Resources said monitoring is still warranted due to the threat of the bird flu on the recovering bird population.
According to the 2025 peregrine falcon report, four peregrine falcons died from the highly pathogenic avian influenza outside of nesting season that year. 
“Overall, Iowa’s nesting population of Peregrine Falcons appears to be stable, with birds generally returning to historic nesting sites each year, but this recovering population continues to warrant annual monitoring,” the report reads. 
The highly pathogenic avian influenza, which has notably killed millions of commercial poultry and egg-laying birds, also spreads among wild migrating birds. The virus primarily infects waterfowl and shorebirds, but can also reach birds of prey like peregrine falcons, osprey and eagles that feast on the other birds.

Volunteers and trained surveyors monitored 20 nests in 2025, of which 13 were deemed successful, meaning the nests raised young birds to the fledgling stage. Volunteers, some of which are employees at power plants since the birds like to nest on energy plant towers, observe the nests several times throughout the year and record if the birds have mated and how many young are in the nest.
There were three more nests monitored in 2025 than in 2024, however the report said none of the 2025 nests were new nests. In 2024, DNR reported peregrine falcons had an above average year for reproduction with an average of 2.77 young per nest and a total of 36 young birds fledged, or surviving to the age of flying.
Reproduction statistics in 2025 were lower, with an average of 1.87 young per nest and a total of 28 fledged, but DNR said the 2025 statistics are similar to the three years prior, which indicates falcon reproduction is stable. Of the 20 monitored nests, one was inactive and four had an unknown outcome.

The birds of prey have dark colored caps, a stripe under their eye and slate blue colored backs with white, speckled chests. The crow-sized birds tend to be monogamous, according to DNR, and will reuse nest sites for several years. 
Many peregrine falcon nesting sites in Iowa have their own livestreams, like the nest on the Dubuque County Courthouse.
In Iowa, the birds tend to nest primarily in eastern Iowa on Mississippi River cliff faces, urban settings or on electrical towers. 
Peregrine falcons disappeared from Iowa in the 1950s as they – like many other birds – were impacted by pesticides like DDT. A total of 169 peregrine falcons were released in Iowa between 1989 and 2003 in an effort to reintroduce the bird to the state. 
Information on peregrine falcon and other wildlife monitoring programs can be found online.

However, Downing said he would not support […]","President Donald Trump poses with members of Montana's federal delegation — Sen. Tim Sheehy, Rep. Ryan Zinke, and Rep. Troy Downing, as well as Arkansas Rep. Bruce Westerman — after signing H.J.Res. 104, rolling back a BLM rule which prohibited future coal leasing in eastern Montana. In a telephone town hall last week, Montana Congressman Troy Downing told constituents he supported President Donald Trump’s toppling of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro, blamed the domestic unrest over ICE raids on social media and biased reporting, and said Republicans want to fix a broken health care system.
However, Downing said he would not support any action that threatened the NATO alliance, while detailing Greenland’s importance to the United States.
The first-term Republican from Montana’s central-and-eastern Congressional District defended the Trump administration and claimed that wages were increasing faster than inflation, saying that was a sign that Republican policies were taking hold. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, inflation grew at 2.7% during 2025, while wage growth outpaced it at 3.8%.
  Venezuela 

Downing said that he supported Trump’s use of force to remove Maduro, calling him “a narco-terrorist.” He also told listeners that Maduro’s regime in Venezuela was supporting Cuba, China and Russia and was a threat to the “Monroe Doctrine,” which he referenced several times.
The Monroe Doctrine is a policy established by the Presidency of James Monroe that asserted that the United States of America should be in control of what happens in the western hemisphere.
“I personally believe the President had Article Two (of the U.S. Constitution) authority because there were exigent circumstances that were harming Americans and totally support that,” Downing said. “I don’t believe this was anything more than protecting American authority.”
Downing said what Americans have missed is that previously even the Biden administration had put a bounty for Maduro.
“I don’t see this as being an act of war. I see this as a Department of Justice action to bring a criminal to trial,” he said.
Downing also claimed by taking out Maduro, America had freed the Venezuela people who were grateful.
“I think we need to be more diligent about what happens in the Western Hemisphere. We need to start looking at other adversaries, starting to do this. I do believe that this has greatly increased the security in the Western Hemisphere,” Downing said.
  ICE, Renee Good and Minneapolis 

Downing said that he supports Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and the work the department is doing in U.S. cities. He also said that he believes the conflict in U.S. cities is happening for a number of reasons including social media and biased news reporting.
The Congressman vacillated between calling the shooting of resident Renee Good “tragic” and asserting protestors are interfering with federal law enforcement.
“Calmer heads should prevail,” Downing said. “Interfering with federal law enforcement is a crime. It appears there were big attempts at interfering with federal law enforcement and when that happens, you put everybody at risk — law enforcement, the people that they’re trying to interact with, the folks that are doing the interfering. And while we all understand that Americans have a First Amendment right to protest, we need to be really careful when that protest crosses the line with interference in law enforcement operations.”
No evidence has substantiated that Good was trying to interfere with law enforcement herself.
Several callers had questions about ICE and the possibility of government overreach. A caller identified as Caitlin from Billings asked, “My question specifically refers to the authoritarian federal overreach that seems to be existing in the organization of ICE and the way they are impacting citizen life.”
While she admitted that there are serious criminal problems, she questioned the cost, especially because of civil unrest in places like Minneapolis and Portland.
“First of all, I don’t subscribe to authoritarian overreach. I don’t agree with that at all,” Downing said. “Immigration, immigration enforcement and federal law enforcement is a tool that’s been around for a long time, used by presidents of both parties. This is not anything new. You look at the news cycles, you look at social media and you look at how they try to make you angry.”
The Congressman leveled the blame at both media and social media, saying that the combination is “blowing it out of proportion.”
“Because they’re angry, because they’re watching social media, they’re starting to say, ‘I’m going to take this beyond doing a demonstration, and I going to start block them from doing their job. And that’s a federal crime to keep them from doing their job,” he said. “This is not a partisan issue. I think that it has gotten as frosty as it has again because a lot of people have been angered because they’re getting one side of the story.”
  Federal reserve 

Last week, news broke of the U.S. Department of Justice investigating Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell for allegedly making false claims to Congress about the renovation of the Washington, D.C., office.
The Federal Reserve system was established more than a century ago to maintain independent federal fiscal policy and make apolitical decisions in the best interests of the economy and U.S. monetary policy.
Downing, who serves on the U.S. House Financial Services Committee, said he believes Powell is “an honorable person.” He also said he supports the Fed remaining independent.
“So, first of all, nobody — nobody’s above the law,” Downing said. “It is of paramount importance that we maintain an independent Fed. Without having an independent Fed, a lot of things that make this country great, that make the dollar the global trading currency that has really fostered innovation and growth and the American dream — a lot of that depends on an independent Fed.”
  Healthcare troubles 

Downing also heard from a number of constituents about the expiration of healthcare subsidies that were begun during the COVID-19 pandemic. While Downing said he sympathized with some of the callers and their lack of insurance, he told listeners he couldn’t support a broken system. Downing voted against renewing the subsidies and they expired at the end of 2025.
He blamed sky-rocketing costs of pharmaceuticals and a shrinking pool of healthy citizens contributing to the rising rates.
“What we’ve seen now is more than a decade of adverse selection, meaning healthy young people keep coming off the plan, and it’s concentrating that risk, which pushes the expenses up, which then gets repriced the following year, and causes the whole thing to circle again,” Downing explained.
He said the answer is reforming the law to by expanding Health Savings Accounts, increasing tax credits, and focusing on drug prices.
“It’s going to be completely unaffordable and collapse under its own weight if we don’t do something,” Downing said.
He said that concerns about healthcare and prices are among the highest volume of calls to his office.
“The subsidies only affected about 7% of the population,” Downing said. “What me and my colleagues want to do is start addressing the things that are causing healthcare to go up.”
He cited that 25% of all insurance costs related to prescription drug costs and he sees that as a way to bring the cost down.

Senate Republican leaders have declared the House school-choice bill -- at least the part about using tax dollars for private schools -- dead on arrival.,"The audio version of this story is AI generated and is not human reviewed. It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
Republican Speaker Jason White got his omnibus education overhaul/school-choice bill through the House last week, but it was a squeaker for the speaker. 
The vote was 61-59 with 17 of White’s GOP supermajority peeling off and voting no, and two either absent or “taking a walk” and not voting.
White put on a full-court press in whipping reluctant Republicans to vote for the measure, which would, notably, allow families to use state tax dollars for private schooling. 
Last week White invoked President Donald Trump and secured a social media endorsement for the bill from Trump Education Secretary Linda McMahon. White has touted letters of endorsement from the state’s Catholic dioceses and other religious groups supporting school choice that could garner their school systems public money. And famed football star Tim Tebow is coming to Mississippi this week to promote the “Tim Tebow Act” part of the House bill that would allow homeschooled kids to play public-school sports.
But opposition to the bill appears more grassroots, and lawmakers are getting calls from their school superintendents and teachers back home urging them to oppose it.
Can White keep his razor-thin vote together for what promises to be an uphill battle for House Bill 2? Senate Republican leaders have declared the House school-choice bill — at least the part about using tax dollars for private schools — dead on arrival.
A win-one-for-the-Gipper campaign, even with Trump as the Gipper, might not be enough to keep the bill alive through a battle with the Senate, especially if House supermajority votes are needed to do so later in the session.
When Trump says jump, Republican Mississippi politicians typically only ask “how high?”
But so far, this appears to be the odd occurrence where a majority of Republicans in the 174-member Legislature in ruby red, Trump-supporting Mississippi are prepared to buck a proposal from his White House.
Quote of the Week

“If little Johnny’s momma is on crystal meth, and little Johnny’s daddy is a pimp, can you tell me how they (are) gonna be able to choose that little Johnny is getting the right kind of education services when that’s not even on their plate?” — Rep. John Hines, during debate over accountability for private schools if the Legislature approves letting parents use tax dollars to pay tuition.

In Brief
Legislation would support nuclear expansion in MS
State officials have signaled they are open to expanding nuclear power development in the state. 
Bills to support this have been proposed in the House and Senate, driven in part by demand for power created by data centers popping up all over the South and Mississippi to support the artificial intelligence boom. 
A bill authored by Sen. Joel Carter, a Republican from Gulfport, would provide $10 million to the Mississippi Development Authority to spend on “future nuclear development” for the upcoming fiscal year. A House bill by Rep. Jody Steverson, a Republican from Ripley, would create a special fund for MDA to administer nuclear site development grants, including reimbursement for some expenses. – Katherine Lin
Antisemitism bill would exempt reporting from DEI ban
Mississippi captured international attention last week after a 19-year-old Madison man allegedly set fire to the state’s largest synagogue, allegedly for its “Jewish ties.”
In the Legislature, Rep. Lee Yancey, a Republican from Brandon, has introduced a bill to combat what he says is a “historic rise in antisemitic violence, harassment and discrimination targeting Jewish students” at K-12 schools and in the higher education system.
The bill would require public schools to prohibit and report antisemitic discrimination and use the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance working definition of antisemitism, which has been adopted by several other state legislatures. Notably, the bill exempts all its provisions of a law the Legislature passed last year to ban DEI statements. This could mean that public school might be required to implement measures that might otherwise be considered DEI-related. – Michael Goldberg
Senate considering pieces of House ed plan
Senate leaders have started filing education bills that mirror portions of the massive education package the House passed Thursday. 
This includes a bill that would allow homeschooled children to play public school sports and another that would establish a math program modeled after the 2013 literacy act. It’s a sign that the Senate is going to kill the House bill — after they pick the sections that they like.
Another education issue showing up in both chambers: cellphone bans. Both the House and the Senate have filed multiple bills that restrict or prohibit the usage of cellphones in school.
Youth mental health concerns have resulted in similar bans in at least 11 other states. A bill that would have required Mississippi school boards to create cell phone policies died last year, but several Mississippi school districts have since passed their own policies, including Jackson Public Schools and Madison County. – Devna Bose
More money for career coaching proposed
Rep. Donnie Bell, a Republican from Fulton, has proposed a bill to provide $20 million to expand a career coaching program for middle- and high-school students. 
The career coaching program under Accelerate Mississippi, the state’s office of workforce development, helps students figure out their post graduation paths. 
In a Senate Appropriations Committee meeting last week week, Courtney Taylor, director of Accelerate Mississippi, said there are currently 204 career coaches that serve 209 schools. The office has identified healthcare, advanced manufacturing and construction as priority career fields. – Katherine Lin
Sales tax exemption for farmers considered
Farmers are being squeezed from both sides with high input costs and low crop prices. 
While there are larger economic forces at play, a bill authored by Sen. Neil Whaley, a Republican from Potts Camp and chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, would exempt commercial farmers from the 1.5% state sales tax on some agricultural and logging equipment. Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann has also championed this exemption. – Katherine Lin
Stand-alone tourism department considered again
A bill to create a Department of Tourism has once again passed the Senate. 
A bill authored by Sen. Lydia Chassaniol, a Republican from Winona and chair of the Tourism Committee, would remove tourism from the purview of the Mississippi Development Authority.
Last year, a similar bill was vetoed by Gov. Tate Reeves over funding issues, and the issue has been debated for years. In 2024, tourism contributed over $18 billion to the state’s economy and provided 136,094 jobs. – Katherine Lin
Bill would create Bobby Gentry Day
Rep. Sam Creekmore IV, a Republican from New Albany, has filed legislation to designate June 3 as Bobby Gentry Day in Mississippi — a nod to the date that Gentry once described in a song as “another sleepy, dusty Delta day.”The bill would honor Gentry, born Roberta Lee Streeter, a singer-songwriter from Woodland in northeastern Mississippi’s Chickasaw County.Gentry rose to national prominence in 1967 with her hit “Ode to Billie Joe,” a haunting song in which an unnamed narrator learns that Billie Joe McAllister has died after jumping from the Tallahatchie Bridge.Gentry has not made public appearances for decades and has largely avoided speaking with fans or the media, including in her home state. – Taylor Vance
Workers’ Compensation exemption proposed
A new exception to the workers’ compensation law would allow employers to not pay workers’ compensation for death or injury when an employee deliberately breaks a safety regulation.
The measure, authored by Rep. Donnie Bell, a Republican from Fulton, places the onus on the employer to prove that they had clearly communicated safety rules to the employee. – Katherine Lin
By the Numbers
$162 million
Estimated first-year cost of the House’s omnibus public education bill, including providing tax dollars for parents to use for private schooling or homeschooling.

Hammer, of Minot, said Republican incumbent Rep. Julie Fedorchak hasn’t delivered on campaign promises of addressing affordable housing and health care costs. He also said Fedorchak and Republicans in Congress have failed to provide a check on President Donald Trump’s power on tariffs and his perceived war powers.
“There’s a lot of disappointment going on in North Dakota,” Hammer said in an interview Monday with Joel Heitkamp on KFGO.
In 2024, Hammer received 30% of the statewide vote while Fedorchak received 70%.

Hammer said while affordability issues are not being addressed in Washington, actions in Venezuela and discussions on acquiring Greenland are instead taking center stage.
“We have wrecked ag markets,” Hammer said. “There’s a lot of consternation out there, and a lot of people aren’t getting what they voted for.”
One of the only ways to fix those problems is for Congress to take back its power, he said.
“By being so silent, by never being out there to criticize what the administration does, our delegation actually fails to help Trump be a better president,” Hammer said.
Hammer has diverse work and military experience, which included the Naval Academy where he became a Marine helicopter pilot, and a deployment to Iraq in 2003 as a platoon commander. Hammer also worked in the Bakken oil field and as a science teacher in Granville.
He also worked as a train conductor in Minot before taking leave to make his congressional run.
Hammer had unsuccessful runs for the North Dakota Public Service Commission in 2022 and the North Dakota Legislature in 2020.
Fedorchak previously announced plans to seek reelection. Trump endorsed Fedorchak’s reelection bid in a social media post last summer.
Alex Balazs, who received the North Dakota Republican Party endorsement in 2024 but lost in the primary, also announced he’s running again this year.

(Photo courtesy of Luann Dart/GS Publishing)The fate of a rural hospital, over 100 jobs and health care in southwest North Dakota communities might hinge on a bill lawmakers will consider this week.
The Jacobson Memorial Hospital Care Center in Elgin, North Dakota, could be forced to close its doors and the area’s only ambulance service if it doesn’t obtain immediate financial assistance, Chief Operating Officer Kristin Heid said. 
“We are in serious financial trouble,” said Heid, who has been serving as the hospital’s administrator since November. “We’re kind of payroll to payroll right now, just hoping that enough revenue comes in to make the next payroll.”

North Dakota Monitor special session coverage

Sen. Donald Schaible, R-Mott, has drafted a bill that would give the health care facility an out. He’s proposing legislation creating an emergency low-interest loan program for nonprofit hospitals and asking legislative leaders to allow the bill to be heard during this week’s special session.
Sen. Donald Schaible, R-Mott. (Photo provided by the North Dakota Legislative Assembly)
“This is a special caveat for somebody in dire trouble,” Schaible said. Without help, “They would fold. It’d be a very massive effect on the community. They’re the largest employer by far.”
The $10 million loan program would be administered by the state-owned Bank of North Dakota under an existing program that awards low-interest loans to support medical facility construction projects. The potential loan amount for any hospital would be capped at $5 million and would require the hospital to demonstrate a business plan to return to solvency. 
“It can’t be a gift,” Schaible said. “They have to have a decent business plan. They have to go through criteria that makes them prove that they’re sustainable and have a future going forward.”
The closure of the critical access hospital would force local residents to travel more than an hour to the nearest facilities in Dickinson, Hettinger or Bismarck. The closure would include health care clinics in Elgin, Richardton and Glen Ullin. The hospital also hosts 21 patients in long-term swing beds, akin to a long-term care facility, who would have to be transferred to nursing homes elsewhere if operations cease, according to the chief operating officer.
The community would also lose the ambulance the hospital leases, staffs and operates, Heid said. 
“We are in a health care desert,” Heid said. “The nearest ambulance would be 30 miles away.”
Assistance is not guaranteed. Legislative Management must agree to allow the bill to be introduced during the special session. Then the Legislature must hold a hearing and vote on the bill. If approved, eligible hospitals like Elgin’s would then have to apply for a loan through the Bank of North Dakota and provide documentation of the need and ability to repay the loan. 
The hospital’s financial crisis has been growing for years. Internal Revenue Service filings show the nonprofit reported deficits of $822,000 in 2022 and $1.5 million in 2023. Audit findings from 2023 identified “material weaknesses” in the hospital’s internal checks and balances necessary to detect and correct any errors in financial records. The weaknesses were attributed in part to the small size of the staff. 
Heid said the hospital is $3.8 million in debt, but the board was not alerted to the dire financial situation until August or September of last year. The CEO’s employment was terminated in November and the position will not be filled, said Heid, who now serves as the hospital’s lead administrator. 
The board has since initiated several internal reforms to get the hospital’s finances back on track. 
North Dakota lawmakers poised to act next week on federal rural health spending

The hospital is still operating on a thin margin despite those reforms, and used a line of credit from a local bank to make payroll around the holidays, Heid said. A low-interest loan from the state is key to keeping the hospital open, she said. 
“I’m not sure if we can continue forward without that money,” Heid said. “Our facility is just very important to the community and our service area. We hope that we can continue to be there to serve our community in the future.”
The hospital plans to host a community meeting in February to share information about the financial situation, a new strategic plan and how the Rural Health Transformation Program funding from the federal government could help the area. 
Tim Blasl, president of the North Dakota Hospital Association, supports the bill and said he believes it will serve as a good solution to help Jacobson Memorial Hospital Care Center return to safe operating margins. 
“It’s structured very well,” Blasl said. “They have to pay these dollars back. So it’s not like a handout or a grant.”
He said some rural hospitals in North Dakota are financially struggling, but they are not in the same degree of trouble Jacobson Memorial Hospital Care Center is. 
Schaible said if the program is successful in helping Elgin or other community hospitals, it could serve as a pilot program that could be expanded in the future.

(Brett Bowers via Getty Images)In recent weeks, the U.S. government punched a hole in Venezuela’s national defense and kidnapped its president, pirated an oil tanker and continued to threaten Greenland in a move that could destroy NATO, the only organization standing between an aggressive Russia and the European Union. 
This recent spate of colonialist jingoism feels like a wall in a byzantine maze crumbling and connecting a different but similar past to a present that follows tragic behavioral patterns. Recent events may feel different, but they carry echoes from generations past. 
Nearly 60 years ago, in a sermon entitled “The Drum-Major Instinct,” the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. preached on the mentality at the center of such violent international escapades. As he said in the sermon: “The parallels are frightening.” 
This instinct we all share — a desire for recognition, distinction and greatness — gets perverted in a most sinister way in the quest for international dominance. What troubled the world then, King said, stemmed from nations engaging in “a bitter, colossal contest for supremacy.”
He did not spare the United States in his critique.
“This is where we are drifting, and we are drifting there because nations are caught up with the drum-major instinct: I must be first, I must be supreme, our nation must rule the world. And I am sad to say that the nation in which we live is the supreme culprit,” he said. 
He continued: “And I’m going to continue to say it to America, because I love this country too much to see the drift that it has taken. God didn’t call America to do what she’s doing in the world now. God didn’t call America to engage in a senseless, unjust war as the war in Vietnam. And we are criminals in that war. We have committed more war crimes almost than any nation in the world, and I’m going to continue to say it. And we won’t stop it because of our pride and our arrogance as a nation.”
But King encouraged listeners to hold onto the desire for greatness, saying that “it’s a good instinct if you use it right.”
He continued: “Keep feeling the need for being important. Keep feeling the need for being first. But I want you to be first in love. I want you to be first in moral excellence. I want you to be first in generosity.”
His advice still rings true but has gone widely unheeded.
World events can feel linear, particularly to the historically uninitiated absorbing current events without context. Every development feeling like some fresh new outrage.
America’s colonial past spans continents and centuries. Current threats to Venezuela and to Greenland seem fresh. But the history and wisdom used to explain it can take on a circular shape or even an figure eight balanced on its side, a reflection of timeless complexity and timeless continuity.
I once had a younger — but in some ways wiser — boss who introduced me to a Lucile Clifton poem about the Mississippi River emptying into the Gulf and the Gulf entering the sea, “all of them carrying yesterday forever on their white-tipped backs, all of them dragging forward tomorrow.”
The past is always flowing Clifton said, and every water “is the same water coming round.” 
But as remains true today, “someone is standing on the edge of this river, staring into time, whispering mistakenly: only here. Only now.” 
Whispering “only here, only now” under current circumstances registers as a lack of alarm. It’s devoting more attention to symptoms rather than to core issues, issues that really should transcend conservative or progressive labels. 
President Trump has said his own morality “is the only thing that can stop me. … I don’t need international law.” He’s suggested that Renee Good’s “disrespectful” attitude justified her fatal shooting at the hands of an ICE officer. 
Insipid “news” reporting focused on the Seal Team’s precision in capturing the Venezuelan leader, rather than on what the shattering of norms means in a world where frayed cables sustain a fragile balance of power.  
They may as well have asked, “Where did Maduro and his wife have the couch?” at the time of the overnight raid. 
Not enough people evaluate events transpiring around us with the requisite alarm. As King said, the parallels to the past are frightening.

However, some advocacy groups have privacy concerns.
WSHU’s Ebong Udoma spoke with CT Mirror’s Emilia Otte to discuss her article, “As CT speed cameras bring in millions and more towns sign up, concerns linger,” as part of the collaborative podcast Long Story Short. Read Emilia’s story here.
WSHU: Hello Emilia. Last July, Middletown, Connecticut became one of the first towns in the state to install speed cameras at some strategic locations. It raked in about $1.8 million in fines in six months. Is that what prompted you to do a deep dive into this?
EO: Yes, it was. I pass that speed camera on Route 66 on a regular basis, and slow down on my way.
WSHU: So basically, could you just tell us how the speed camera works?
EO: Essentially, towns have requested to place them in certain strategic locations where people tend to speed, and the cameras will capture when someone goes over 10 miles per hour, over the speed limit, or if they run a red light. And once the cameras have done that, a citation will go out to the person whose car has run the light or sped and then there’s a process for contesting that citation if the person feels they were unfairly given it, or they can simply pay the fine.
WSHU: Yes, for instance, in the situation with Middletown, it was $1.8 million collected, but they charged $2.8 million and this was just in six months.
EO: Yes, it’s true. It does take a little bit of time. There’s a delay between how long it takes to actually collect the fines versus when the citations go out.
WSHU: Okay, now you say that other towns are now looking into this. Initially, some people, especially the ACLU, expressed significant concern about privacy. How has that worked out now that cameras have been installed in certain towns?
EO: So the concerns about privacy, particularly with the ACLU, a lot of that came out of concerns about a particular company called Flock, which there was some concern about data sharing from license plate readers, which are sometimes in towns used by police departments. And there was some concern about that data being shared with federal law enforcement and then being used, particularly around immigration enforcement. That is different from speed or traffic cameras, but the ACLU is still concerned about the use of speed and traffic cameras just for privacy. I will say that Connecticut’s law is extremely strict regarding how the data from speed and red light cameras can be used. It can only be kept for 30 days. So even if say that the camera captures a crime being committed, that data cannot be used as evidence for that. So Connecticut’s law is very strict about how that can be done.
WSHU: Now you say other towns are now looking into setting up their own speed cameras. Which towns are looking at this? And is there a difference between urban communities and rural communities?
EO: There is a large mix of towns looking into this. 11 have been approved by the state so far, because the state has to approve any plan that a municipality makes. So far, I believe Beacon Falls, Fairfield, Stratford, Milford, Greenwich and New Haven have been just approved. Stamford was just approved. So it’s a real mix of small and large towns, and Hartford is still waiting on approval. But towns all over the state are looking into this. Many of them want the traffic cameras in areas around schools.
WSHU: Okay. And there’s also a situation here where you talk to some people in Litchfield County and how it’s working out over there. Could you just give us a little bit of what’s going on there? And they’re not bringing in as much money, but they feel very happy with the way it’s worked out, right?
EO: Yes, the first town to install traffic cameras was a little town called Washington in Litchfield County. They have three cameras. They brought in, you know, $662,000 they issued in fines. That’s pretty good for it’s a small town, but what is really key, they’re saying, is that people are actually slowing down, which was the only thing the first selectman told me that actually worked to get people to slow down.
WSHU: And a large city that’s looking at this right now is Bridgeport, but there’s still some hesitancy, right?
EO: So Bridgeport is in its very, very early stages. I went to a meeting of their public safety committee, where they were really just starting to discuss what would happen if we put some cameras in. And yes, there’s some concern in Bridgeport about, is this the place we want to put our money? Should we be investing in more policing rather than this? There are so many things we need. Why should we be doing this? And I think also in Bridgeport, there has been some concern, because they recently installed traffic cameras on school buses to monitor when cars do not stop for school buses. There’s also been a big controversy over the use of drones to alert emergency responders. So I think in Bridgeport, there’s a bigger context around the use of technology in general and whether or not that’s a good thing and whether or not it really works.
WSHU: But overall, it seems as if we’re going to have a lot more speed cameras in a lot more communities going forward.
EO: Indeed.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026_0115_SR_SpeedCamera_071-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-19 10:59:58.630679

(Photo via Google Earth) The Iowa Board of Pharmacy has sanctioned a pharmacist for dispensing drugs without a prescription, and lifted restrictions on a physician convicted of felony narcotics distribution.
The board alleges pharmacist Joshua Davis of Corydon self-reported dispensing a variety of prescription medications to a friend without any legitimate prescription from a health care provider. There were about 23 fraudulent prescriptions dispensed by Davis “over a period of a few years,” the board alleges — although the board has not disclosed when that was or where Davis was working.
The board also alleges that in pharmacy records that Davis altered the name and birthdate of his friend to conceal the fraudulent nature of the drug dispensing.
The board charged Davis with knowingly making misleading, deceptive or fraudulent representations in the practice of pharmacy or engaging in unethical conduct that is harmful or detrimental to the public; diverting prescription drugs from a pharmacy for personal use or distribution; forging or altering a prescription; and practicing outside the scope of his profession.
To resolve the case, Davis and the board agreed to a settlement that calls for his license to be placed on probationary status for two years, during which time he will be subject to some form of worksite monitoring. Davis also agreed to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and complete 10 hours of education on law or ethics.
State and federal records indicate that for the past several years, Davis has worked at Your Neighborhood Pharmacy, an affiliate of Wayne County Hospital, in Corydon.
The Iowa Capital Dispatch was unable to reach Davis for comment Friday.
Other pharmacy board actions
Other Iowa health professionals whose disciplinary cases recently came before the Board of Pharmacy include:
— Dr. Troy Adolfson, 55, of Ankeny, a physician who sought reinstatement of his Controlled Substances Act registration allowing him to prescribe narcotics.
In 2019, Adolfson surrendered his South Dakota medical license, as well as his Drug Enforcement Administration license, after being criminally charged with felony narcotics distribution.
In that case, Adolfson admitted that between January 2017 and April 2017, he knowingly and intentionally distributed oxycodone by writing prescriptions for 60 to 140 pills to a co-worker and two other people, who then had the prescriptions filled at a pharmacy. Adolfson said the three individuals gave him the oxycodone in exchange for $50 each and a portion of the pills. “I estimate I prescribed approximately 1,400 pills of oxycodone in this manner,” Adolfson told the court.
Adolfson was sentenced to 18 months in federal prison and ordered to pay a $20,000, according to the court records. More than two years after Adolfson admitted his conduct, the Iowa Board of Medicine issued Adolfson a warning and placed his medical license on probation for five years, during which time he was barred from prescribing, administering or dispensing controlled substances for the treatment of chronic pain.
In 2024, Adolfson entered into a voluntary restriction of his CSA registration. In 2025, the Iowa Board of Medicine lifted its restrictions on Adolfson’s medical license, after which Adolfson sought reinstatement of his CSA registration without restriction.
After Adolfson provided the Board of Pharmacy with a letter explaining his past conduct and rehabilitation, the board concluded he had provided sufficient evidence of rehabilitation to warrant reinstatement of the registration. Adolfson, the board said, had “demonstrated he is committed to maintaining his sobriety and is passionate about continuing in his profession as a physician.”
The reinstatement requires Adolfson to participate in the Iowa Professional Health Program or, if he is deemed ineligible, he must submit to board monitoring for three years.
The board records make no mention of the fact that in February 2025, Adolfson was arrested and charged with drunken driving. Police alleged he was driving through a Costco parking lot when he collided with another vehicle. The other party to the accident summoned police, citing concerns that Adolfson appeared to be drunk.
Police alleged Adolfson admitted to drinking and had a blood-alcohol level of .270 — more than three times the legal limit for driving. He later pleaded guilty to first-offense drunken driving and sentenced to one year of probation. He was discharged from probation after six months, court records show.
— Alexander Goodwin, 32, of Camanche, who recently agreed to surrender his pharmacist’s license to the board. The board alleges Goodwin admitted stealing “two Adderall tablets” from a Walgreen’s store in Clinton where he was employed, as well as an unspecified amount of other drugs from the Clinton store and a Walgreen’s store in Dubuque.
The board charged Goodwin with knowingly making misleading, deceptive or fraudulent representations in the practice of pharmacy or engaging in unethical conduct that is harmful or detrimental to the public; diverting prescription drugs from a pharmacy for personal use or distribution; and habitual intoxication or addiction to the use of drugs.
As part of the recent settlement in which Goodwin agreed to surrender his pharmacist’s license, he also agreed he will not be eligible to seek reinstatement for at least one year.
Court records show that in June 2025, Goodwin was criminally charged with theft and prohibited acts for the alleged misappropriation of drugs from the Clinton store. Police alleged that an internal audit identified 60 missing oxycodone pills from the pharmacy’s inventory.
According to police, surveillance footage from the store indicated that on one occasion, Goodwin stole, and then swallowed, an oxycodone pill while on duty at the store, and that an inventory showed losses at the store involving 80 different types of medications.
Police also alleged Goodwin admitted that he had been previously caught on video attempting to steal medications while working at the Hartig Drug store in Savanna, Illinois.
The Iowa criminal charges were later dismissed when Clinton County prosecutors said they couldn’t locate the general manager of the Walgreen’s store to testify.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Your-Neighborhood-Pharmacy.jpg,,,2026-01-19 10:59:58.630679

(Staff and submitted photos)TOPEKA — Four candidates for Kansas governor loaned their campaigns at least $1 million to bolster the bottom line on year-end finance reports and support claims of political momentum eight months from the August primary election.
Former Gov. Jeff Colyer started his campaign with a $50,000 loan in May and followed with three loans in December to push his personal commitment to $1.05 million at the end of the reporting period Dec. 31. He raised an equivalent amount from donors, his report said, and had $1.8 million in cash after expenses.
“Matching that support personally shows I’m fully committed to winning this race and delivering results for Kansas again,” said Colyer, who was governor from 2018 to 2019 after resignation of Gov. Sam Brownback.
Businessman Philip Sarnecki, with no previous experience in electoral politics, personally loaned his campaign a jaw-dropping $2 million. That left $2.3 million in his account — the largest cash-on-hand total of any 2026 candidate for governor.
“Our campaign has raised the most money in Kansas gubernatorial history and we did it in far less time than every other Republican candidate in the field,” Sarnecki said. “There’s an incredible energy around our campaign. Kansans are tired of losing and they’re tired of career politicians.”
Scott Schwab, the Kansas secretary of state, loaned his campaign $1.045 million. Overall, Schwab raised $1.4 million, spent $365,000 and held $1.05 million cash-in-hand.
The million-dollar club included Joy Eakins, a former Wichita school board member who loaned herself an even $1 million. She raised $1.1 million overall and spent $116,000. Eakins said the United States was on the cusp of a “golden age” under President Donald Trump, but Kansas could miss out on that good fortune if it failed to elect a conservative governor.

Other borrowers
Former Johnson County Commission member Charlotte O’Hara approved a personal loan of $485,000 to her campaign. At year’s end, she had $510,000 in her gubernatorial account.
State Insurance Commissioner Vicki Schmidt, a former Topeka state senator, loaned herself $81,500 and closed the year with $928,000 in cash. She said she was grateful for “confidence Kansans are placing in this campaign — and we’re just getting started.”
Kansas Senate President Ty Masterson of Andover didn’t make a loan to his campaign in 2025. He ended the year with $687,o00 in his account, which was less than five of his GOP competitors.
Masterson said nearly all of his donations arrived in the final three months of 2025 after he overhauled his campaign staff by dropping Axiom Strategies and hiring consultants more closely aligned with Trump. He said his nonprofit organization Take Back Kansas, which didn’t have to identify donors, entered 2026 with $700,000 in its account.
“We’re building a movement of everyday Kansans who are fed up with being taxed to death and watching their state fall behind,” Masterson said.
In the Democratic Party’s race for the gubernatorial nomination, neither Sen. Ethan Corson nor Sen. Cindy Holscher, both of Johnson County, made loans to their campaigns. Holscher raised $397,000 and had $179,000 at end of the year. Corson reported contributions of $902,000 during 2025, but had $526,000 in cash on Dec. 31.
“That’s one of the largest hauls for any non-incumbent Democrat running for governor in Kansas history,” Corson said in a fundraising appeal. “That’s why I am the only candidate in this race who has what it takes to go toe-to-toe with extremist Republicans and their large fundraising hauls.”

Attorney general contest
In the campaign for attorney general, incumbent Republican Kris Kobach of Lecompton began 2025 with $217,000 in his campaign account. He added $337,000, spent $52,000 and reported cash of $502,600 at the close of 2025. He said the previous high in terms of cash-on-hand at this juncture of a Kansas campaign for attorney general was $501,300 by Democratic Attorney General Steve Six in 2009.
Kobach said he didn’t make a personal loan to his campaign in 2025. He formally filed for reelection on Jan. 8.
“From day one, my focus has been on protecting Kansas families, upholding the rule of law and fighting for our Kansas values,” Kobach said.
Kobach’s likely Democratic opponent in the November election, Chris Mann of Lawrence, submitted a report showing he raised $536,000 last year. He spent more than half of the total and retained $257,000 in cash. In 2022, Mann lost the attorney general’s race to Kobach by less that 2 percentage points.
“Kansas families are anxious, frustrated and fed up. They deserve real change. Instead, they get Kris Kobach, an attorney general more focused on pushing his personal agenda than on helping the people of Kansas,” Mann said.
Three candidates for Kansas secretary of state — Schwab chose to seek the GOP nomination for governor — made loans to their campaigns. Rep. Pat Proctor, R-Leavenworth, loaned himself $134,000 to bring his campaign receipts to $312,000. By the end of 2025, he’d spent $102,000 on the race.
“This record-setting support is not about numbers on a spreadsheet,” Proctor said. “It  reflects a growing movement of conservatives who want secure elections, accountable government and leaders who put Kansas first.”
His primary opponent, Rep. Ken Rahjes, R-Agra, said he received $24,000 in contributions, including an $8,000 personal loan.
Democratic candidate Jennifer Day, a former Kansas House member from Overland Park, said she raised $84,000 from more than 700 donors. In addition, she loaned herself $43,000. During the period, she spent $69,000.
Day said the stakes were high in the election because Kansas Republicans were engaged in “backroom meetings to eliminate early voting and weaken longstanding mail ballot protections.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/millionairesGOP-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-19 10:59:58.630679

Some legislators are listening,Leonardo Bevilacqua,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/19/desoto-school-board-wants-to-oust-peer/,"Audience members express emotion as public comments are given during the DeSoto County School Board meeting in Hernando, Miss. on Thursday, Nov. 6, 2025.","The audio version of this story is AI generated and is not human reviewed. It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
HERNANDO — Some DeSoto County School Board members want a legal process by which an elected peer — another school board member — can be ousted for concerns including malfeasance and abuse of power. They passed a resolution in November formally asking lawmakers to consider granting that authority in the current legislative session.
A new law “would give school boards more authority when situations arise that cause concern in the community,” school board President Jerald Wheeler said in a statement to Mississippi Today.
For now, there is no legal mechanism for a school board to remove one of its members, said Jim Keith, attorney for the DeSoto County School Board.
The board members may get their wish to change that, at least in terms of a bill.
Sen. Kevin Blackwell, a Republican from Southaven, has filed Senate Bill 2068, which would allow a school district’s local governing authority, by majority vote, to remove a school board member for breach of public trust, neglect of duty and abuse of authority. The school board would first have to vote on a recommendation. Rep. Kimberly Remak, a Republican from Olive Branch, is the primary author of House Bill 573, the House version of Blackwell’s bill. The bill now has multiple coauthors and bipartisan support. Remak did not respond to requests for comment.
On Dec. 30, Sen. Michael McLendon, a Republican from Hernando, announced on Facebook plans to introduce the Whiteside Accountability Act, a separate bill that, if passed into law, would provide “a statutory recall process for school board members who engage in conduct that undermines student safety, including actions that defend or minimize sexual crimes against minors.” The bill would give the power to school board members to remove other board members. 
McLendon introduced the Education Leadership Accountability Act on Jan. 14.
DeSoto County School Board members’ interest in ousting another elected board member stems from public calls for Michele Henley to resign after she wrote a letter and testified on behalf of Lindsey Whiteside, a former volunteer assistant girls’ basketball coach at DeSoto Central High School who had already pleaded guilty to sexual battery of a minor. At least nine other district employees wrote letters of support for Whiteside.
On Oct. 13, a judge sentenced Whiteside to three years of house arrest and seven years of probation — a much lighter sentence than the 30 years that prosecutors sought. The sentence divided the tranquil Memphis suburbs in Mississippi, where Whiteside was also a youth pastor.
Whiteside pleaded guilty earlier that day to committing sexual battery against a minor who attended her church. Some people, disturbed by Henley’s testimony and that some school district staff also wrote letters vouching for Whiteside’s character, began calling for Henley’s removal from the school board. They took to social media and spoke out at school board meetings. 
“Disappointment, outrage, neglect of power” are a few reactions McLendon has heard from constituents since the conclusion of the Whiteside trial.
“It’s one thing to write a letter on the character of a person that you know, but writing the letter on official letterhead and using your elected title carries weight as an authoritative figure,” McLendon said of Henley.
Henley did not respond to multiple requests for comment by Mississippi Today.

In a statement posted to Facebook on Oct. 15, Henley said the letter she wrote did not express support for Whiteside’s actions “or endorse her behavior.” The letter, shared in the post, describes Whiteside coaching and supporting Henley’s daughter in basketball.
As for her testimony, Henley wrote, “Contrary to what has been claimed, I did not testify for the defense. I was subpoenaed by the District Attorney to appear in court. While on the stand, I was asked whether I condoned Lindsey’s actions. My response was no. When asked about what her sentence should be, I stated that such a decision was for the judge to determine.”
‘A mechanism is necessary’
A half-dozen DeSoto County residents told Mississippi Today they believe Henley abused their trust when she wrote a letter of support on Whiteside’s behalf. The victim’s family said they felt Henley exercised poor judgment in supporting Whiteside over a district student.
The family members also said they felt Henley’s actions should be grounds for removal from the school board. After making a statement condemning Henley’s actions, the school board passed a resolution formally asking the legislature for legal recourse to grant them the power to oust one of their members, due in part to public outcry.
“The Board of Trustees of the DeSoto County School District firmly believes that a mechanism is necessary for the removal of school board members … to ensure a safe and supportive learning environment for students,” read the Nov. 20 resolution by the DeSoto County School Board.

Every board member save Henley, who abstained, voted in support of the recent motion.
Katie Sasso, the mother of a DeSoto County School District student, said Henley’s departure would allow for the community to heal. Aubrie Johnson, a concerned community member, said, “It was shocking to see (someone) support a real-life predator.”
DeSoto County District Attorney Matthew Barton wrote Henley in October that “when an elected official chooses to protect the abuser rather than the abused, she ceases to serve the public good.” Barton said he called for Henley’s resignation so integrity and confidence could be restored to the school board.
On Nov. 6, at Henley’s first school board meeting appearance since the hearing, two members of the victim’s family called for her resignation. Pam Pegram, the victim’s grandmother, asked that Henley look at her during their exchange, pausing for Henley’s response. Pegram was met with nearly two minutes of silence. 
“You heard the brave young girl read her victim statement and tell everyone in that courtroom about the vile and evil things that the predator had done. You heard the despair in the victim’s mother’s letter. You heard the frustration and the anger from the victim’s stepdad,” Pegram said. “You could have any time said, ‘I’m so sorry. I can no longer support this.’ But you cowardly refused to stand up for a child that attended school in your district.”
At that meeting, the school board voted to replace Henley as its president. Henley remains a board member. 
In conversation with the public
DeSoto County Parents for Accountability, a parent group that found a broad audience on Facebook, is also pushing for Henley’s resignation.
The effort included organizing a protest of the school board on Oct. 17. The group has also criticized the school board, saying it meets at times when parents can’t attend.
The parents’ rights group helped organize a boycott of the school district the week after the Whiteside verdict. They protested what they called a lack of transparency and response by district leadership.

Nancy Kemper, grandmother of a DeSoto County student, said during the public comments section of the meeting that she was unable to attend past meetings because they were scheduled during school pickup time. She said she felt the meeting schedule gave Henley the opportunity to dodge accountability.
“I know a lot of people that wanted to come here today and they feel like it was really convenient — especially for (Henley) — that they couldn’t come and speak because they are in line picking up their children.”
Seeking a legislative response
The bills introduced this legislative session aren’t the first attempts to extend school boards’ authority, including their power to remove other school board members.
In November, the DeSoto County School Board voted to support HB 817, which Remak introduced during the 2025 legislative session. HB 817 would have allowed school board members, by a majority vote and through the local governing agency, to remove a colleague for “malfeasance, misfeasance, or nonfeasance,” breach of public trust and abuse of authority.
The DeSoto board’s vote was symbolic; the bill had died in committee.
Another bill filed this session, authored by Kabir Karriem, a Democrat from Columbus, would also allow for the removal of a school board member for misconduct and “breach of public trust.” House Bill 521 would also limit a school board’s power to request a hike in property tax.
Karriem said he hoped to prevent school boards from triggering “irresponsible” property tax increases or other rash actions. He was inspired to reintroduce his bill from the 2025 legislative session because of his constituents’ concerns in Columbus.
“When you have school board members that feel like they have complete autonomy that creates problems for the community,” Karriem said. “And there always needs to be checks and balances.”
“There needs to be the opportunity to remove bad actors.”
If one of the bills to let school boards oust another board member becomes law, Mississippi will be one of the first state to grant that power. New York allows school board members to vote out their peers for “official misconduct.” Indiana allows removal by a circuit judge, while Virginia and Alabama give that right to governors. Illinois grants the power to a regional superintendent. In 24 states, excluding Mississippi, an elected school board member can be removed by a recall vote.
There is a lot of support for the bills before the Legislature this session, McLendon said. “It’s a nonpartisan bill that holds everyone accountable for their actions when it comes to protecting children.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/10112358/3X0A2787.jpg,,,2026-01-19 10:59:58.630679

The headlines are making clear, big and important debates and actions – especially several controversial actions of the Trump administration and its allies — have continued to roil American policy and politics in the New Year. From the health care wars to the widespread immigration crackdowns to a bevy of contentious foreign policy moves, Americans are concerned about the present and future and, in many instances, deeply divided.
It’s the kind of moment that keeps political scientists and pollsters busy as they work to assess the state of public opinion and how it’s likely to impact voting patterns and upcoming elections, and one especially trustworthy monitor of the situation in North Carolina is Meredith College political science professor and pollster David McLennan. And recently, we caught up with McLennan for an extended interview in which we dug into several of these matters.
In Part One of our recent extended conversation with Meredith College political scientist and pollster David McLennan, we examined some of the top issues making political and policy news in the New Year and how they relate to the latest developments we’re seeing in American public opinion and voter registration numbers.
In Part Two of our chat, we continued this conversation, and looked more closely at some of the most controversial issues – including the Trump administration’s national crackdown on immigrants and its controversial foreign policy actions and statements — as well as how these controversies might impact the 2026 elections and, in particular, North Carolina’s highly anticipated U.S. Senate race between former Gov.

(Photo by Lisa Hupp/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)Two dog-walking Soldotna residents are fighting a pair of unusual federal fines after getting in an argument with a fur trapper in the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge last year.
Laura McIndoe and Trafford Evanoff appeared in federal court Tuesday this week to enter “not guilty” pleas and formally challenge $280 per-person tickets issued by a refuge officer for interfering with an authorized trap line. Further hearings are scheduled for later in the spring.
McIndoe did not return a phone call Friday afternoon. 
Conflicts between dog walkers and fur trappers are not unusual in Alaska despite efforts to avoid them, but federal citations are rare, according to a search of online court records. 
The citations facing McIndoe and Evanoff do not identify the trapper, who was not fined. The injured dog also was not named.
According to the citations, the trapper called a Fish and Wildlife Service officer after McIndoe’s dog became caught in one of the trapper’s foothold traps and McIndoe became “very upset and cursed at him, telling him to stay away.”
“He said the woman told him that her sons were in their 30s and big men, and if they see him, they will kill him,” said the affidavit, signed by officer Shay Hurd. 
Two of the trapper’s other traps were destroyed, and the trap that snared the dog was lost. 
According to Hurd’s affidavit, McIndoe said “the dog was doing better” two weeks after the incident, “after a large vet bill.”
The trapper had a permit to work within the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge, correctly marked their trap line with a warning sign, and placed the trap line in a valid area more than one mile away from the road, according to Hurd’s account.
McIndoe was cited for “interfering with persons engaged in authorized activities” in the refuge, as was Evanoff, who was identified as her son.

Commemorative services are planned across the state Monday as the nation pauses for a federal holiday in observance of civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. MLK Day is a national day of service to encourage all Americans to volunteer and improve their communities.
Bishop William Barber – president of Repairers of the Breach and architect of the Forward Together Moral Movement – will mark the day with a series of speeches encouraging people of all backgrounds to come together and sound the alarm against unjust policies that have led to healthcare cuts, gerrymandered districts, reduced funding for public schools, and increased aggressive actions by ICE agents.
Barber and a coalition of North Carolina religious leaders and advocacy organizations recently announced plans for a memorial march in mid-February to speak out against regressive policies while highlighting what they believe is a better path forward for the nation. NC Newsline sat down with Bishop Barber to discuss the upcoming march and his thoughts as we mark the 2026 MLK Day.

(Photo courtesy of Sam Stukel/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)Emails obtained by clean-water advocates show the state of South Dakota declined $290,000 of federal funding for zebra mussel decontamination stations at Pactola Reservoir, which the advocates say is evidence that the state isn’t taking the invasive threat seriously enough.
The state agency tasked with fighting aquatic invasive species said it declined the money because it was only for equipment, without additional ongoing funding needed for the equipment’s operation and maintenance. The agency defended its approach to zebra mussels, saying it’s focused on the most practical steps it can sustain with available staff, emphasizing boat inspections and education aimed at slowing the spread.
Zebra mussels are tiny invasive shellfish, originally found in Asia and Europe, that spread by clinging to boats. They clog pipes, water intakes and hydroelectric power equipment, cut swimmers’ feet, and change the native aquatic ecosystem.
The number of zebra mussel-infested lakes in South Dakota grew from one in 2014 to 32 now.


State Department of Game, Fish, and Parks Secretary Kevin Robling said while testifying to lawmakers last January that he was unaware of any missed zebra mussel funding opportunities.
“I am not familiar with any money that we reverted back or did not spend or did not use,” Robling said.
South Dakota Lakes and Streams Association board members had heard otherwise. They obtained emails, reviewed by South Dakota Searchlight, that show federal agencies and the state discussed Pactola Reservoir containment options in 2022 and 2023, and that the state ultimately declined U.S. Bureau of Reclamation funding for decontamination equipment at Pactola. The reservoir, a key Black Hills water source and recreation site, was confirmed to have zebra mussels in July 2022.
South Dakota Lakes and Streams Vice President Deb Soholt, a Republican former state senator from Sioux Falls, said the emails reflect a broader lack of urgency on the part of the state.
“We’ve made a policy decision that there’s nothing we can do to stop this, no matter how much money we pour at it,” Soholt said. “That’s a flawed premise. Other states are fighting. We should be, too.”
Game, Fish, and Parks spokesperson Nick Harrington said the agency is doing what it can.
“Our inspection numbers have continued to increase throughout the years,” he said. “If they want to say that between a certain year there was a funding lapse, well, inspections were increasing. The program was operating. The program was funded.”
He said there were 14,556 boat inspections in 2021, 18,582 in 2022, 18,642 in 2023, and 22,165 in 2024. Inspectors ensure boaters have cleaned off any plants, mud and debris, drained live wells or tanks that hold water, and dried everything completely before launching in another waterbody.  
Harrington said Robling did not recall the declined funding when he was asked about it last year during a legislative hearing.
What the emails show
At Pactola Reservoir, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation operates the dam, the U.S. Forest Service manages the surrounding land and recreation sites, and the state Department of Game, Fish, and Parks oversees fishing and boating regulations and invasive species control. 
The emails show the bureau, Forest Service, and Game, Fish and Parks convened multiple meetings in July 2022 to discuss management options “for preventing the spread of zebra mussels from Pactola Reservoir to surrounding waterbodies.”
On July 19, 2022, a state employee summarized the state’s approach to zebra mussels at Pactola.
“After reviewing our current resources and limitations that exist with staff and equipment, it is very evident that there is no way we can implement a comprehensive containment approach on Pactola Reservoir,” wrote GF&P Fisheries Supervisor Jake Davis.
Davis wrote that the state would “focus on outreach and education,” adding that “inspections will still occur.” 
The emails referenced decontamination units, which are hot water, high-pressure sprayers used to clean boats by killing and removing zebra mussels.

Davis said in the emails that there was already a decontamination unit at Pactola.
In February 2023, the bureau drafted Pactola Reservoir zebra mussel containment recommendations. They describe goals to educate the public and contain the spread. They also note that the bureau had secured funding “for two additional decontamination units at Pactola Reservoir.”
On March 7, 2023, the state’s fisheries program administrator informed the bureau that, “after discussion with Senior Administration,” the department did “not desire to enter into an agreement” for the $290,0000 of federal funding to purchase two additional decontamination units at Pactola.
The proposal included another $200,000 for the Forest Service to help pay for the equipment, according to emails obtained by Lakes and Streams. 
“These were one-time funds, and no additional funds were going to be made available for future operation and maintenance of these pieces of equipment,” Harrington said in a statement to South Dakota Searchlight. “As a result, we requested that the funds be used to help cover the costs of labor at current inspection stations, as that is where they could be used to best support” the state’s aquatic invasive species program.
“Unfortunately, due to the way the funds were requested, their purpose could not be altered,” Harrington said.
Game, Fish and Parks spent $4.65 million to combat aquatic invasive species in the state from 2021 to 2024, with $3.7 million coming from outside the department (predominantly from federal agencies).
Harrington said the department focuses its resources on public outreach and inspections.
“Our goal is to slow the spread of these species,” he said. “Our message is clean, drain, dry.”
Harrington said compliance at inspection stations is high. 
“People know the rules, and they’re following them for the most part,” he said. “Ninety-eight percent compliance is better than seat belts — and those save our lives.”
Advocates say ‘not enough’
Soholt said the compliance rate is less when no official is waiting at the shoreline to inspect a boat. She wants lawmakers to convene a public-private working group to develop a new statewide strategy, including options like seeking private donors or adding a small license fee per boat to help fund more zebra mussel containment.
“We could fiercely protect the remaining reservoirs and lakes if we acted now,” she said. “Instead, we’re saying, ‘It’s inevitable.’”
Dan Loveland, also with Lakes and Streams, said watercraft inspections are the most effective tool, and South Dakota’s inspection effort is weak and under-resourced. He said “clean, drain, dry” isn’t enough without enforcement to back it up.
Loveland, too, wants a statewide stakeholder process and a dedicated funding source to fight aquatic invasive species.
“Get all these stakeholders together and go through what is happening to our state, and let’s talk about different ways that we can approach this,” he said. “Let’s find a funding source that we can dedicate to fighting the aquatic invasive species all across South Dakota.”
Robling gave a presentation to lawmakers on Thursday that included information on zebra mussels. He showed lawmakers a time-lapse map of the species’ spread since the late 1980s to underscore that South Dakota is not alone.
Asked about research, Robling said genetic approaches aimed at reducing zebra mussel reproduction are still in early stages and have seen “very little success” so far, though Minnesota remains a research hub.
Rep. Tim Goodwin, R-Rapid City, said he plans to propose a legislative summer study on zebra mussels.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/52136145384_962964e6e4_k-e1768767999912-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-19 09:57:09.650315

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Utah lawmakers will be returning to Capitol Hill on Tuesday for their 45-day 2026 legislative session — and already the list of issues they plan to tackle is long, with the number of bills filed growing by the day. 
Because the Utah Legislature is controlled by a Republican supermajority, the state’s GOP legislative leaders often set the agenda while Democratic lawmakers try their best to fight against legislative efforts they oppose. 
Utah’s top Republican legislative leaders — Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, and House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper — told Utah News Dispatch in wide-ranging interviews last week what bills and issues are top of mind for them for 2026. 
Meanwhile, the state’s Democratic leaders — Senate Minority Leader Luz Escamilla and House Minority Leader Angela Romero, both Democrats from Salt Lake City — say they’re bracing for a legislative session that’s expected to be tough on many different fronts.
Not only is the state’s more than $30 billion budget expected to be tight due to federal tax cuts — along with pressure from Republican legislative leaders to continue their streak of income tax rate cuts. But also, 2026 is an election year for all 75 seats in the House and 15 in the Senate, likely to add an extra layer of political calculus and gamesmanship.

And already, bills are stacking up that target groups including undocumented immigrants and transgender people that Democrats and community advocates are gearing up to fight. 
It remains to be seen what legislative proposals survive both the House and Senate — but insights from Adams and Schultz help shed light on what they’re more likely to prioritize. 
Utah advocates, faith leaders call on lawmakers to take more action on homelessness

Here are some of their top priorities, along with issues that are expected to be among the most contentious this year: 

 More tax cuts:

	 A sixth year of an income tax rate cut — on top of more than $500 million already slashed in 2026 and 2027 from the state’s budget due to federal tax changes under the One, Big Beautiful Bill Act — and an effort to rein in property taxes. At the same time, legislative leaders have directed all state agencies to propose ways to cut 5% from their budgets as part of a statewide efficiency exercise. 


 Judiciary changes:
Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, Schultz and Adams are all supportive of expanding the Utah Supreme Court from five justices to seven. They say it’s to bring Utah in line with other states and help speed up decision-making, but Democrats question the timing of the move and whether it’s in “retaliation” for several court rulings that Republicans have vehemently opposed, especially in the state’s redistricting court battle. Schultz is also supportive of increasing “transparency” on judges. Several other bills have also been filed, including SB57 which would increase the number of judges for the district court, juvenile court, and the Court of Appeals. HB262 would increase the threshold of votes needed for a judge to be retained. Additionally, lawmakers have filed at least three proposed constitutional amendments related to the judiciary. HJR5 would allow the governor to select any qualified candidate to fill a judicial vacancy, even if the candidate isn’t nominated by a nominating commission. And HJR13 would empower the Legislature to initiate a “special” retention election if the Legislature decides “that judge is unfit or incompetent.”

Utah lawmaker wants to cut off resources for undocumented immigrants to get them to ‘self-deport’


 Another attempt to solidify lawmakers’ ability to change ballot initiatives:

	Also tied to the state’s redistricting lawsuit — which traces back to a 2018 ballot initiative for an independent redistricting process known as Proposition 4 — Utah’s Republican leaders are expected to propose another constitutional amendment to ensure the Legislature has the ability to change laws enacted by voters. The language of what that proposed amendment would be, however, is unknown.


 Homelessness:

	Gov. Spencer Cox has proposed lawmakers set aside $25 million in one-time money and $20 million in ongoing funding for “homelessness and criminal justice high utilizers.” At the same time the governor has been supportive of a controversial proposal to build a 1,300-bed homeless campus in northwest Salt Lake City. Adams and Schultz have said they’re open to discussions around homelessness but they didn’t commit to fully funding Cox’s recommendations. Schultz said he wants cities and counties to do more to provide funding while also saying the state wants to remain a partner. 


 Immigration issues:

	Adams and Schultz did not name any specific immigration-related bills they’re supporting as of yet, but some of the most controversial proposals to surface so far ahead of the session look to cut off publicly-funded resources for undocumented immigrants, restrict their ability to legally drive, and criminalize providing housing for people without legal status.

Anti-transgender bill among ‘most harmful and outrageous’ Utah LGBTQ+ advocates have seen


 Anti-transgender legislation:
LGBTQ+ advocates are opposing a list of bills already filed, including one that would strike the word “gender” from Utah code, effectively erasing transgender anti-discrimination provisions for housing, employment and crime victims. That’s among the “most harmful and outrageous” bills advocates with Equality Utah have seen — but that bill may run into issues in the Senate. Adams said he’d be hesitant to make any changes to Utah’s 2015 law that enacted LGBTQ+ protections while balancing religious freedom. However, other bills are in play — including one to make permanent Utah’s indefinite moratorium on prescriptions for puberty blockers and hormone therapy to minors. Schultz said he’s supportive of turning that moratorium into a ban. 


 Elections: 

	Last year, the House and Senate clashed over a sweeping bill that originally would have drastically restricted voting by mail. The Legislature ultimately passed a watered-down version to slowly phase out automatic voting by mail in 2029, but Schultz said he wants to revisit that legislation — including enacting in-person ID requirements. Adams said he’s open to more changes, but he’s supportive of keeping voting by mail while reinstating vote-by-mail signature verification, which would under the current law phase out by 2029. Both Schultz and Adams also said they want to add additional requirements to ensure people without legal immigration status can’t vote (which is already illegal). Democrats question whether that’s needed, since instances of that happening are rare. 

That’s not an exhaustive list. Lawmakers are also expected to continue efforts to focus on issues including energy development, critical minerals, water, housing, artificial intelligence regulations and more. 
Almost half of Utah’s third graders don’t read at grade level, report says

The governor is also pushing a bell-to-bell ban on cellphones in schools, and improvements to the state’s lagging K-3 literacy, including encouraging a policy to hold back third graders unless they pass a reading test to advance to fourth grade. 
Here’s a full list of Senate Republicans’ priorities, and here’s the House GOP’s. Senate Democrats’ priorities, Escamilla said, are aimed at going “back to the basics” by focusing on unmet needs for education, health care, child care, housing and other issues while “defending democracy.” And House Democrats’ priorities, among other issues, promote inclusion and representation, education and environmental protections. 
Another income tax cut — plus an effort to limit property taxes
For a sixth year in a row, the Senate president and House speaker want to cut the state’s income tax rate, currently sitting at 4.5%, as part of an effort they say is to help keep Utah affordable, competitive with other states, and a place where people will want to live, work and do business. 
But the governor notably didn’t include an income tax rate cut in his 2026 budget recommendations, pointing out that Utah already won’t collect about $300 million of corporate and individual income tax in 2026 and $200 million in 2027 due to federal changes to tax policy in Congress’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act . 
That’s on top of the more than $1.4 billion in tax cuts lawmakers have approved over the past five years, much of which has come from income tax reductions. Under the Utah Constitution, income tax is largely required to fund the state’s public education system, which advocates and Democrats have argued continues to go underfunded. Despite significant increases in education funding in recent years, Utah is still among the lowest-ranking states for per-pupil education spending.
Utah Legislature OKs another round of tax cuts, totaling $1.4 billion in 5 years

Meanwhile, lawmakers on the powerful budgetary oversight body, the Executive Appropriations Committee, last month directed budget subcommittees to propose 5% cuts across state agencies as part of a statewide efficiency exercise. 
“You know, will those 5% cuts stick across the board? No. But I think it’s good for everybody to go in and look at their budgets,” Schultz said. 
The Legislature won’t put its finishing touches on the budget until the final days of the session, scheduled to end March 6, so it’s not yet clear what programs will or won’t get funded, but Democrats including Romero and Escamilla are concerned about Republicans prioritizing yet another tax cut while needs for child care, education, deeply affordable housing, homelessness and others continue to go unmet.
“I have major concerns about what’s going to be cut and how that is going to impact our most vulnerable,” Romero said.
In past years, the Executive Appropriations Committee has preemptively set aside a pot of money ahead of the session for a tax cut — but this year it didn’t. House Republicans, however, listed in their priorities $200 million for a tax cut. 
Adams said $200 million is the number needed to reduce the state’s income tax rate from 4.5% to 4.45% — but he acknowledged that whether lawmakers are able to do that depends on how the budgeting process goes. 
Under Trump tax cuts, Utah won’t collect $500 million in income taxes in 2026, 2027

“We’ll be scraping the top of the paint can lids to try to find a way,” Adams said, but he added it’s a “high priority.” 
“We want to do it smart. We want to be responsible. We want to make sure all the state needs are being met. That’s super important,” Schultz said, but he added that reducing “cost of living” is a top priority for House Republicans, and that includes lowering the income tax rate again. 
Escamilla argued Utah can’t keep up its streak of foregoing hundreds of millions of income tax revenue year after year. 
“We’ve been consistent in opposing any income tax cuts. That’s problematic,” Escamilla said. “I mean, I really do not know where they’re going to get the funds from.” 
Additionally, Schultz said he’s supportive of efforts to reign in property taxes at the local level and prevent the tax burden shifting away from commercial properties and on to Utah homeowners. 
He pointed to a proposed constitutional amendment and accompanying bill being sponsored by Rep. Jill Koford, R-Ogden, that would increase the percentage of the fair market value of a home that is exempt from property tax, from 45% to 60%. He said that’s expected to drop people’s property taxes “a couple hundred bucks a year.” 
While state agencies look for 5% cuts, Schultz said he also thinks local governments should go through a similar exercise, so he’s supportive of legislative efforts to limit their ability to enact property tax hikes. Sen. Dan McCay, R-Riverton, also has a bill to limit taxing entities from adopting a budget that exceeds 5% of the previous year’s property tax budgeted revenue, excluding new growth. 
Are Utah homeowners paying more than their fair share of property taxes? What an audit found

Pointing to Salt Lake County’s recent 14.65% property tax hike to address inflation and rising costs, Schultz said “people are losing their minds over that.” 
“If our local governments don’t recognize what’s happening and get their budgets in order instead of just increasing property taxes, they’re going to see more and more of these types of bills,” Schultz said, though he added he’s not sure what bills will pass. “But I’ll tell you, it’s widely popular, and it’s something that we absolutely need to consider.” 
Romero expressed concerns with limiting cities, counties and school districts’ ability to oversee property taxes, both as a matter of encroaching on local control but also how that could impact services and school districts. 
Moe Hickey, executive director of the advocacy group Voices for Utah Children, expressed similar concerns, but especially when thinking about pairing that with income tax reductions. 
“If you’re cutting income tax, which leads to cuts in services, which local communities want to keep, then they have to raise their property tax,” he said. “They don’t operate separately. There’s a relationship there … If you cut the income tax enough, you’re either going to lose services or you’re going to have to increase local tax, plain and simple.” 
Expanding the Utah Supreme Court and other courts
When asked why it’s a priority to expand the Utah Supreme Court from five justices to seven, Adams responded with a question: “When did Proposition 4 pass?”
That was in 2018, more than seven years ago. “Do I need to say any more? We’re in 2026,”  he said, arguing it’s taken far “too long” to litigate the state’s lawsuit over redistricting, which alleged lawmakers overstepped when they repealed and replaced the independent redistricting voter-approved law. 
So far, the courts have agreed, which led to a restoration of Proposition 4 as law, but also a new court-ordered map that included one Democratic-majority district and three heavily Republican districts — a ruling that Republicans including Adams have ardently opposed. 
Saying it’s not court packing, governor supports expanding Utah’s appeals courts  

Adams also said expanding the court may lead to more nuanced decisions. 
“I haven’t seen many split decisions come out of our court,” he said. “And the other side, even if you disagree with it, deserves at least a minority opinion. And I believe having an expanded court probably gives an opportunity to have maybe a little bit of diversity there.” 
The Senate president said also he thinks more justices will help speed up court decisions. That’s even though Chief Justice Matthew Durrant told The Salt Lake Tribune in October that adding more justices could lead to more deliberation, delaying timelines further. 
“I think it will actually help them,” Adams said. “I can’t imagine it’s going to bog it down.” 
Adams also said part of that conversation will include increasing funding for the Utah Supreme Court, as well as more money to expand the appellate courts, which he noted has been a “high priority” for the judiciary. 
Schultz is also supportive of expanding the courts, but he said he also wants to increase “transparency” on judges so it’s easier for Utahns to look up their rulings. 
“We want them to have the same type of transparency to the public that we as legislators have,” he said. “When we look at retention elections, the No. 1 thing I hear from constituents is ‘We have no idea who these judges are … we can’t find any information.”

Escamilla said she’s concerned about expanding the Utah Supreme Court in a time when Republican lawmakers have clashed with the courts on their redistricting rulings. 
“It’s an issue of timing. It feels like retaliation,” Escamilla said, adding that her constituents have said “they don’t want to see retaliation against the judiciary as they’re exercising their responsibilities and checks and balances of our government.”
Lawmakers’ power over ballot initiatives
While vowing to appeal Utah’s new court-ordered congressional map to the Utah Supreme Court, Adams and Schultz in November also said lawmakers would consider proposing another constitutional amendment — subject to Utah voter approval — that would “clarify” when lawmakers can change voter-approved laws enacted by ballot initiative. 
It won’t be the first time Utah’s Republican-controlled Legislature has tried to do this — but the last attempt failed, voided by the courts. 
After a groundbreaking Utah Supreme Court ruling in 2024 made clear that the Legislature’s power over “government reform” ballot initiatives has limits, Utah lawmakers put a question known as Amendment D on the 2024 November ballot to sidestep that ruling and rewrite the Utah Constitution. 
Amendment D still void: Utah Supreme Court upholds district court decision

Had it been approved by voters, Amendment D would have enshrined in the Utah Constitution the Legislature’s unfettered power to repeal or alter any type of ballot initiative, including Proposition 4. 
However, the ballot language posing the question to voters — written by Utah’s top Republican legislative leaders — did not explain that in plain language, prompting critics to sue. They claimed Amendment D’s language was “false and misleading.” 
Third District Court Judge Dianna Gibson agreed, while also determining officials failed to meet constitutional publication requirements — so she voided the question. State attorneys appealed the decision to the Utah Supreme Court, which affirmed the district court’s decision.
Adams, however, balked at characterizing their new attempt as Amendment D 2.0.
He said the goal is to make clear that laws passed by the Legislature and enacted by ballot initiative are on a “level playing field” or “co-equal.” 
“We just want to reinstate the co-equal status,” he said. “It’s really important people understand that there’s no intent to do away with initiatives. It just needs to be co-equal status.” 
Adams argues that the Utah Supreme Court’s ruling that says the Legislature must satisfy “strict scrutiny” or assert a compelling government interest in order to change “government reform” ballot initiatives was too ambiguous and left the door open to a flood of ballot initiatives that lawmakers can’t change. That, he argues, could doom Utah’s future. 
“The Supreme Court ruling will destroy Utah. It’s basically changed our entire form of government,” he said. “We live in a republic. … (U.S.) Supreme Court (Thurgood) Marshall said the difference between a democracy and a republic is order and chaos. We have chaos right now.” 
5 key Utah redistricting issues to watch in 2026

Pressed on what the language of the proposed amendment will be, Adams said “we’re not anywhere close” to determining that, “but there will be a constitutional amendment.”
“And we will find a way,” he added, “to make sure that we put together language that our Supreme Court is happy with.” 
Escamilla said Senate Democrats will be on guard for any attempt to weaken voters’ ability to enact laws via ballot initiative. 
“That is a top priority,” Escamilla said. “Protecting citizens’ initiatives is critical.”
Escamilla argued the Utah Supreme Court’s interpretation of the existing Utah Constitution made clear that lawmakers can change “government reform” ballot initiatives — but they can’t undermine them. 
“It’s when it gets ridiculous, actually undermining the entire intent behind what the citizens of Utah voted for,” she said. 
She added that she’s concerned about any attempt to change the Utah Constitution in ways that could empower the Legislature to make changes to voter-approved laws in more ways than they already have the ability to do. 
“You’re either going to say we will change and undermine, or not,” she said. “If you’re going to allow that, I think there will be opposition. The public is exhausted and tired of being undermined by the government when it comes to citizen initiatives and decisions being made by the public.”

The American Cancer Society estimates that 5,400 men in Alabama will be diagnosed with prostate cancer this year. It also estimates that about 10% of those will die from the disease. That is 400 less than the ACS’s 2025 estimation of diagnoses. 
Jane Adams, government relations director for ACS Cancer Action Network in Alabama, said in an interview Wednesday that early screenings help improve outcomes and eliminating cost-sharing allows more patients to get screened.
“We’ve been doing a lot of activity with survivors, making sure that lawmakers are hearing about how important the screening is and how important eliminating barriers is to getting the screening,” Adams said. “I think a lot of those efforts have led to it being a priority, and we’re always appreciative of that.”
The bill was the second passed by the Senate. 
According to the American Cancer Society, Black men are at higher risk for the disease. The mortality rate for prostate cancer was 18.7 per 100,000 men in 2022, half of what it was in 1993. The 5-year survival rate for the disease is 100% for the majority of men diagnosed with localized- or regional-stage prostate cancer, but drops to 37% for those diagnosed with distant-stage disease, according to the American Cancer Society. The 10-year survival rate for all stages combined is 98%.
The bill only applies the cost-sharing elimination to patients who have a father, brother or son with a prostate diagnosis or cause of death; Black men, and men over fifty.

(Photo by Meghan O'Brien/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota’s workforce shortage and federal limitations on a $189.5 million infusion of cash are making some lawmakers worry about the feasibility and sustainability of the state’s plan to strengthen rural health care.
The funding comes from the $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program. Congress included it in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, in response to concerns that the bill’s Medicaid cuts will hurt rural health providers. Medicaid is a federal-state program that provides health insurance for people with disabilities or low incomes.
Lawmakers aren’t able to amend the state’s approved spending plan to address their own concerns, they learned in a presentation Thursday in Pierre. Laura Ringling, senior policy adviser for Gov. Larry Rhoden, told lawmakers the state can only make “some minor budget shifting” going forward.

The role lawmakers play is to authorize the state to spend the $189.5 million. Lawmakers on the House Appropriations Committee will be the first to consider a bill authorizing the funds.
Sen. Taffy Howard, R-Rapid City, has questions and frustrations about the funding. She told South Dakota Searchlight she intends to ask more questions of state officials during what will be “a long process.”
“It’s a matter of if this is something taxpayer dollars should be spent on,” Howard said. “If it’s not, then it’s our job to deny authority.”
The problem, Howard added, is that if the Legislature doesn’t spend the money, another state will spend it instead. 
South Dakota’s plan outlines 10 initiatives, including creating a “data atlas” for providers and facilities to share local and state agency data, improving the rural health care workforce, improving chronic disease management, establishing regional maternal and infant health care hubs, and regionalizing behavioral health care, among other projects.
Ringling told lawmakers that one-time incentives will bolster the rural health care workforce so that it is sustainable and long-lived years after the one-time funding ends.
Federal government awards $189 million to South Dakota from new rural health fund

Incentives will include sign-on bonuses, relocation assistance and rural service stipends for health care professionals not already covered by the state’s rural assistance program, such as nurses, doctors and physician assistants. The federal government requires that people who are awarded workforce funding must commit to five years in the rural community.
“Nothing we do with these funds will matter if we don’t have the trained people in our communities to provide the care,” Ringling said.
Several lawmakers asked questions on Thursday about workforce needs and how those would be addressed outside of the incentives mentioned.
Howard told officials during the presentation that she’s skeptical about the proposal and its sustainability. The programs, especially the behavioral health and maternal and infant health care hubs, she said, could require more than one-time funding to operate in financially strapped rural communities.
Ringling said the programs, operated by non-state government organizations, must submit a sustainability plan to be considered for funding. Howard took that to mean taxes and fees could be raised at the local level.
“It doesn’t help the local citizens if the state says, ‘Well, the program is done. We wash our hands. We didn’t increase your taxes and fees,’ but then the sustainability model of the local entity increases our taxes and fees. They’re still feeling that pinch,” Howard said.

Rep. Erik Muckey, D-Sioux Falls, told South Dakota Searchlight that the presentation didn’t address the consequences of the One Big Beautiful Bill’s changes to Medicaid, including work requirements. Muckey called the one-time funding “a Band-Aid over a bullet wound.”
“There is excitement to be had about rural communities receiving the investments they deserve,” Muckey said. “But this still doesn’t answer the question about how to sustain quality health care going forward because of massive cuts to Medicaid.”
South Dakota’s award was short about $4 million of the $193.3 million it requested for the first year of the program, and it was less than the amounts received by neighboring states. The state does not know why it received less funding.
Ringling said the state requested nearly $213 million for the next year. She expects to receive that amount if “we’re doing what we said we were going to do.”
“If for some reason we’re delayed, we’re not able to get going, we’re not able to show that we’re performing and meeting the things that we said we would do in our application,” Ringling said, “we risk a lower dollar amount and losing those funds.”
Once the authorizing bill is signed, departments will begin finding organizations to carry out the initiatives in the state’s Rural Health Transformation Program application. The money must be spent by October.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)A new report says investors own 24.84% of Nevada’s single-family homes, equating to about 303,000 properties. That’s 6% higher than the national average and the seventh highest share in the nation behind Wyoming (30.9%), Maine (29.76%), Montana (26.78%), Alaska (26.65%), Hawaii (25.96%), and New Hampshire (25.04%).
“Like most of those other states, Nevada’s economy depends heavily on tourism, which suggests that many of the investor-owned homes are probably vacation homes and short-term rentals,” national analyst Rick Sharga said via email of the Q3 2025 Investor Pulse report from BatchData.  
Efforts abound at the local and federal levels to limit investor purchases of single-family homes. 
In 2023, Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo vetoed a bill that would have limited corporations to buying no more than 1,000 homes a year. Last year, the governor enlisted a Republican ally to kill a similar measure.  
Now President Donald Trump wants to ban the largest institutional investors – those who own more than 1,000 homes. 
The report says such policies miss the mark. 
Small investors (those who own between one and five properties), hold nearly 92% of the investor-owned market, while large investors (those owning six to 10 properties) hold just under 4%. 
“Mega-investors with 1,000+ homes control just 2.1% of the inventory,” or about 0.4% of housing stock, the report says. “Wall Street isn’t the dominant force.” 
Some experts contend the effect of institutional investment on prices is negligible. By one estimate, prices increase 1.7% for every percentage point of housing stock owned by institutional investors, who currently hold less than 1%. 
Public dialogue about investor home purchases “is full of misconceptions,” says the report, which contends investors “aren’t necessarily competing with traditional homebuyers. …. They target lower-priced, older homes in need of work rather than the move-in ready houses most families buy.”  
Investors add inventory to the market, rather than competing with traditional homebuyers, the report suggests.
In the third quarter of last year, the report says, investors paid an average price of $449,981, “well below the national average of $512,800.” 
Investors buy and sell homes at below market prices, the report found, because they are concentrated in areas with prices lower than the national average, and because investors tend to buy older homes in need of work. 
The average price of a home sold by an investor In the third quarter of 2025 was $412,517— which is below the national average sales price of $512,800, the report says. 
Purchase and sales prices for investors “dipped slightly from the previous quarter, which had the highest average purchase price and sales price in the five plus years covered in the Analysis.”
Additionally, the report found 40% of investor sales are to other investors.
In Las Vegas, investors own 26.29% (about 172,000) of single family homes. Of those, about 6% (10,445) are owned by institutional investors. That’s 1.6% of all single-family homes.  
“These percentages are well above the national average of 2% and 0.4% respectively, and suggest that large investors view Las Vegas as an attractive market for single-family rental homes,” says Sharga. 
In Reno, investors own 23.17% of all single-family homes (about 43,000). Institutional investors own about 265 homes in the area, or just 0.6% of investor-owned homes, and 0.14% of all  single-family homes.
Investors own approximately 18% of the 86 million single-family homes in the U.S.
In five states – Texas, California, Florida, North Carolina, and Georgia – investors own 5 million properties, accounting for one-third of all investor-owned homes in the U.S., reflecting “strategic capital deployment in high-population, high-growth and high-yield markets,” the report says. 
The states with the lowest share of investor-owned homes are Minnesota (9.15%); Connecticut (10.16%); District of Columbia (11.1%); Wisconsin (11.43%); and Rhode Island (11.78%). 
“Low-share states typically feature strong local economies, high homeownership rates, or regulatory environments that discourage investor activity,” the report says. 
Investors were on the buying end of 34% of all single-family home purchases in the third quarter of 2025, marking the highest share in the last five years, according to the report. That’s up one percentage point from the second quarter and up nearly eight points from the third quarter of 2024, when investors purchased 25.5% of residential homes. 
“Q3 2025 was the seventh consecutive quarter where the largest investors sold more properties (5,798) than they bought (4,663),” the report says, calling it an indication that investors are divesting. 
The report reveals “two seemingly incongruous trends,” says BatchData president Ivo Draginov, who notes while the percentage of homes purchased by investors is at a five-year high, the number of homes sold in the third quarter last year plunged by 23,000 from a year earlier. 
“This suggests that the higher percentage of homes being purchased by investors is due at least in part to fewer home purchases by traditional homeowners rather than by overly aggressive investor activity,” Draginov said. 
Investors are “essential market stabilizers rather than speculative disruptors,” the report concludes. “At a time when traditional buyers are sidelined by financing constraints and limited inventory, investors provide critical liquidity in an otherwise constrained market.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2229115449-1024x714.jpg,,,2026-01-19 08:58:20.177931

Challenges remain,Michael Goldberg,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/19/house-legalize-mobile-sports-betting-mississippi-legislature/,"This year's proposal would direct state online gambling revenue to the government employees' retirement system, in an effort to win over the Senate.","The audio version of this story is AI generated and is not human reviewed. It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
The Mississippi House will try for the third year straight to legalize mobile sports betting with new provisions aimed at winning over Senate lawmakers who have opposed the measure, the House Gaming Committee Chairman said.
This year’s legislation — in a key change from last year’s proposal — would direct all state revenue from online betting to the state’s government pension system, Casey Eure, a Republican from Saucier who chairs House Gaming, told Mississippi Today.
The House and Senate are still at loggerheads over how to shore up the Public Employees’ Retirement System, which has unfunded liabilities of about $26 billion. 
The new proposal will also contain other “compromises” for those who have previously opposed legalization.
The persistence of a thriving black market in Mississippi and an estimated tens of millions a year in tax revenue that legal sports betting could generate has prompted a fierce push from some lawmakers to legalize the practice.
“By legalizing mobile sports betting, we can eliminate much of the illegal market — including protecting underage bettors — and provide real consumer safeguards in a regulated environment,” Eure said. “This legislation will also give our brick-and-mortar casinos a new revenue stream to ensure their continued success, while the state revenue generated will help close the gap in funding for our public employees’ retirement system.”
The effort also has a strong and well-funded lobby from sports betting companies. But the legalization effort could again face significant headwinds, from skeptical state lawmakers in both parties and federal regulatory changes since the election of President Donald Trump.
Senate Gaming Chairman David Blount, a Democrat from Jackson who has thus far opposed mobile sports betting legalization, told Mississippi Today he wouldn’t take a position on Eure’s bill until he read it. But he said directing the revenue to PERS wouldn’t be near enough to justify legalization. 
“These are the same people who abolished the income tax last year, which generates more than $2 billion a year to the state budget. If we legalized mobile sports betting tomorrow, it would take more than 1,000 years to pay off the unfunded liability in the retirement system,” Blount said. “The amount of money that we’re talking about is infinitesimal compared to the $26 billion unfunded liability of the retirement system.”
Eure has said legalizing online betting could generate as much as $80 million a year in tax revenue. Blount said the estimates he’s seen max out at about $30 million. Either way, the total would not pay off the system’s unfunded liabilities in the near term.
The Senate has already sent the House a bill to put half-a-billion dollars of the state’s current surplus into PERS, in addition to putting $50 million a year over the next decade. House leaders have proposed a recurring revenue stream for PERS, either from the state lottery or by legalizing mobile sports betting.
Blount also pointed to the rise of “prediction markets,” exchanges where people bet on the outcomes of future events. These markets, dominated by platforms such as Kalshi, are different from traditional sports betting because traders set prices. Also, prediction markets try to make money by letting people trade against each other to reveal how likely an event is, while sports betting companies make money by setting odds so the bookmaker always takes a cut.
Under the Trump administration, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has taken a lax approach to regulating prediction markets, allowing platforms to expand their offerings in states around the country, including states such as Mississippi, where mobile sports betting remains illegal.
“Predictions markets have essentially legalized nationwide mobile betting,” Blount said. “Whatever amount of money was promised last year, that number is reduced, maybe greatly reduced. Because due to the actions of the current administration, no state can tax or regulate prediction markets, which are effectively gambling.” 
Traditional sports betting giant DraftKings, which has lobbied Mississippi House Speaker Jason White to legalize online betting, launched its own prediction market product last month.
Two U.S. Senate committees could take up a bill later this month to establish new rules for the cryptocurrency industry, and some on Capitol Hill are pushing to include language that would tighten regulations on prediction markets. 
In addition to the role PERS and prediction markets might play in the debate over mobile sports betting legalization in Mississippi, a proposal this year would likely need to assuage the concerns of lawmakers from districts with casinos. Some brick-and-mortar casinos have feared the legalization of online betting could undercut their profits.
To protect smaller casinos from revenue losses, Eure’s bill last year would create a pot of money that establishments could draw from for the first five years after online sports betting becomes legal. It also included safeguards to prevent people from placing bets with credit cards. 
Eure still believes legalization would be an economic boon for Mississippi.

No, not that one.
I’m talking about the address he delivered on April 14, 1967, titled “The Other America.”
It lays out King’s political and economic thinking in a way that should dispel any “well-actually” attempt to turn the civil rights leader into a secret conservative. (Among other proposals in “The Other America,” King called for a guaranteed universal income.)
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
But I want to focus on a story King told about meeting a white man on a plane. This man, King said, claimed that Black Americans protested too much, saying “you aren’t doing anything for yourselves.” The white man, King said, noted that many groups of immigrants had managed to move from the margins into mainstream American society over generations. “Why don’t you teach your people to lift themselves by their own bootstraps?” the man said.
King reminded the man that white people took Black people to this country as property and denied them the opportunities other groups had.
“And I finally said to him that it’s a nice thing to say to people that you oughta lift yourself by your own bootstraps, but it is a cruel jest to say to a bootless man that he oughta lift himself by his own bootstraps,” he said. “And the fact is that millions of Negroes, as a result of centuries of denial and neglect, have been left bootless.”
Correcting that wrong, King said, meant nothing less than rethinking American governance. The nation needed more than “a romantic or aesthetic something where you merely add color to a still predominantly white power structure.”
“Integration must be seen also in political terms where there is shared power, where Black men and white men share power together to build a new and a great nation,” he said.
This seems especially true in Alabama, a state with a terrible history of white people denying power to Black Alabamians and responding to those demanding it with violence. Like King, who survived a segregationist bombing of his Montgomery parsonage in 1956.
Today, the efforts of King and other brave Americans mean we have far more Black representation at the federal and state level than we did 70 years ago.
But we have a still-larger white leadership that all too often appears to consider Black political participation inherently illegitimate. That criminalizes attempts to help Black men and women vote. And fights tooth and nail to prevent Black Alabamians from having a meaningful voice in their governance.
This simulacrum of freedom means suffering and inequality. The median income of a white household in Alabama is $76,092. For a Black household, it’s $46,756.
In 2021 — in the middle of one of the best job markets in recent memory — the unemployment rate for white people in Alabama was 3%. For Black Alabamians, it was 5.6%. And for Black men, it was 7.1%.
The poverty rate for white people in Alabama in 2024 was 11.5%. For Black Alabamians, it was 23.4%.
I can go on. Infant mortality for Black Alabamians is more than double that for white people. Cervical cancer rates are higher for Black women, and survival rates are lower.
Would democracy — real democracy, reflective of people and not conservative propaganda — solve these problems? Probably not. But it would make it a lot easier to focus on solutions. Because our leaders would be responsible to the people living here, not a right-wing news channel or the shifting convictions of a White House occupant.
It’s trite on Martin Luther King Jr. Day to say that his work is not finished. It feels more precise to say that it’s barely gotten started. Until we secure genuine political power for Black Alabamians — not subject to the whims of white politicians — none of us will live in a democracy.
And all of us will pay the price.
We will continue to live under severe property tax caps — imposed by white planters who hated the idea of educating Black children — that kill our schools, sustain our poverty and benefit no one but the wealthiest landowners.
We will live with paranoid nonsense about election fraud that makes it harder for everyone to vote.
And we will continue getting lawmakers who feel no obligation to the people they represent. Who spend their time putting immigrants, Muslims and transgender people in danger.
Changing it, as King said, will be a decades-long process.
“Somewhere we must come to see that social progress never rolls in on the wheels of inevitability,” King said in that 1967 speech. “It comes through the tireless efforts and the persistent work of dedicated individuals. And without this hard work time itself becomes an ally of the primitive forces of social stagnation.”
Those forces robbed King of his time. And if we do nothing else today, we may consider how they keep us from that dream in his other famous speech.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Martin-Luther-King-monument-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-19 08:58:20.177931

This year’s legislative session, which is Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s last in office, kicks off Jan. 20, 2026, amid signs of economic downturn. (Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s final regular legislative session starts at noon on Tuesday (don’t rule out the possibility of a special session before she leaves office at the end of the year, though—she’s called eight during her two terms in office).
While other lame-duck sessions have produced slugfests between the branches (see the 2010 food tax fight with Gov. Bill Richardson and the lawsuit over Gov. Susana Martínez’s 2017 vetoes), top lawmakers said they remain optimistic that the session will end on a high note. 
Senate Majority Leader Peter Wirth (D-Santa Fe) told Source NM in a call Friday lawmakers “are going to start with something different” this session, and both chambers will push an expedited agenda of four bills to the governor’s desk within the first two weeks.
Those proposed bills include bipartisan legislation for the state to enter two medical compacts for doctors and social workers; a bill to provide $1.5 billion for the state’s roads; a bill to define the terms “harm to self” and “harm to others” to state laws for involuntary commitment; and finally legislation to ban New Mexico public entities from participating in immigration detention.
These are bills that “have agreements between the House, Senate and governor’s office,” Wirth said, and are similar to versions brought in the 2025 session.
“We said we were going to work on these bills for the 30-day session,” Wirth said. “We’ve done the work, we’re ready to go.”
On the House side, Democratic leaders gathered Friday at the First Choice Community Healthcare clinic in the South Valley, an institution House Speaker Rep. Javier Martínez (D-Albuquerque) said represented the culmination of years of work from local community organizers as well as local, state and federal elected officials. As a result, he said, the clinic exemplified functional government, a contrast with the dysfunction in Washington. 
He and other Democrats said how proud they were that New Mexico can backfill federal cuts to health care, Medicaid and other federal programs, even as they prepare to craft a budget that’s relatively tighter than years’ past. 
“As we go into the 2026 legislative session, we go in with a renewed sense of hope,” he said.
Five takeaways as the lawmaking begins

It’s all about the money
New Mexico’s Constitution limits even years to 30-day sessions focused on developing the state’s budget, along with bills sanctioned by the governor and ones that were vetoed in the prior session. 
Some of Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s stated priorities for her last session include: health care, public safety and immigration issues, though full messages on those topics will not be available until the start of the session.
The governor can also issue messages throughout the session, in order to make a bill “germane” or relevant to the agenda. 
Competing budgets
While the governor sets out the priorities and puts out a budget recommendation, it’s the Legislature that doles out the dollars. 
The two proposals are pretty close to each other: Both seek to spend a little over $11 billion from the state’s general fund. 
By the #s: See where the New Mexico governor, Legislature disagree on $11B in budget priorities

But there are a few big differences, particularly around funding for the state New Mexico Early Childhood Education and Care Department.
Lujan Grisham asked for about $160 million more than the Legislature is seeking, funding she said is necessary to pay for free childcare for New Mexico families regardless of their income.
House leaders told Source that they are open to negotiating, but want to exercise fiscal restraint in light of tightening economic conditions while also ensuring childcare is free for those who most need it. 
Martínez said Friday the Legislature “will make sure that New Mexico delivers on its promise for a fully funded, affordable, high quality, universal child care system that puts the workers at the forefront.”

Crime and punishment
In recent years, Lujan Grisham has focused intently on public safety, urging legislative proposals in a 2024 special session on criminal competency, crime reporting, gun violence, drug overdoses and more. The special session adjourned after a matter of hours without lawmakers hearing any of the bills on her agenda.
On the final day of the 2025 session, Lujan Grisham lambasted lawmakers for what she called “appalling and unacceptable” inaction on juvenile crime after the March 21 shooting in Las Cruces that killed three people and injured 15.

Other topics

Other top priorities lawmakers and the administration have announced include creating regulations for AI and for  “microgrids.” The state is pushing for record investments into some state water programs. Legislators are expected to renew a push for increased alcohol taxes in the wake of high death rates from drinking. 
Martínez said Friday he expects debate and potential action on the issue of Legislature “modernization,” which could mean paying lawmakers, extending session lengths or other changes to avoid cramming so much important work into a 30-day session.
“I believe in the ability of my colleagues to get things done, but I don’t think 30 days is enough. And so we’ve got to modernize the Legislature,” he said. 
Constitutional amendments only require a simple majority in both Houses to pass, and do not require a message from the governor, nor a governor’s signature, according to the legislature’s rules and terms.

How to participate
The Roundhouse is open to the public, and New Mexicans can attend the 2026 session in-person and online. Each day, new calendars for the Senate, House of Representatives and committees will be posted to the “What’s Happening” section of the Legislature’s website, showing the bills up for vote or discussion. 
For people who want to attend in-person, calendars also show the time and room where a committee hearing will be held. New Mexicans can submit written public comments by email or sign up to speak on a bill virtually on video chat platform Zoom. The specific virtual attendance links are also on committee calendars. 
Members of the public can search for state representatives and senators by using the “Find My Legislator” page, clicking “search by address” and entering their address into the field. 
To watch live hearings of Senate or House floor proceedings or committees, visit the “webcast” page. To find recent recordings, click the “new recordings” tab. Find older recordings by clicking on a specific calendar date from the left side of the page. 
While lawmaking is the primary purpose of the legislative session, the Roundhouse also comes alive with protests (expect a big one on opening day), exhibitions and other types of events. For more information about special days and events, (such as Tourism and Outdoor Recreation Day on Jan. 26 or the legislative basketball game on Feb. 5) , check out the Legislature’s social calendar.

What that means for homeowners interested in going solar depends on the type of system they’re interested in, household usage and personal finances.
As of Jan. 1, the federal government is no longer offering tax credits worth up to 30% of the cost of a new solar residential system. Those tax credits were enacted under President Joe Biden’s administration and eliminated under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act signed by President Donald J. Trump in July.
With a typical rooftop solar setup in Connecticut costing upwards of $30,000, those credits were worth $9,000 or more on a system purchased up front by a homeowner.
Systems that are leased or subject to third-party power purchase agreements are still eligible for a separate, commercial tax credit until Dec. 31, 2027.
However, in order to qualify for those incentives, solar systems will have to comply with new rules put in place by the OBBA limiting the amount of foreign-manufactured parts from countries like China. Those rules are expected to increase the price of panels, in addition to the loss of any available tax credits.
How has the loss of the federal incentives impacted the solar market in Connecticut?
Jason Calabrese, the operations manager at Middlebury’s Ion Solar Pros, predicted that sales would drop between 20% and 25% in 2026 as a result of those changes and the uncertainty they have brought to the solar market. 
“A good portion of it’s based upon customer confusion,” Calabrese said. “Some people think that solar is ending altogether, that there’s no opportunity now to go solar. It’s created some uncertainty in the marketplace, which uncertainty in any marketplace is not good for sales.”
In the aftermath of the OBBA’s passage, several solar installers and financiers around the country shut down or filed for bankruptcy. In Connecticut, the fallout has been limited to two companies — PosiGen and Sunnova — according to Mike Trahan, the executive director of the Connecticut Solar and Storage Association.
Trahan noted that even before the law, more than two-thirds of new solar systems being deployed in Connecticut were owned by third parties. For those residents who still want to own their own systems, Trahan said the loss of the federal tax credits had forced developers to work with banks to create new financing options.
“It’s become an interesting time, I’ve been hearing from people and how they are trying to figure out new products, new lending, loan and sales products, to consumers,” Trahan said.
What state-level policies are changing?
In addition to the loss of federal tax credits, Connecticut’s Public Utilities Regulatory Authority in December approved several changes to its residential and commercial solar programs. One of the most notable changes was a 704% increase in the charge assessed on the output of residential solar systems, from half-a-cent per kilowatt hour to more than 4 cents a kWh.
That increase was dictated, in part, by state lawmakers in order to better align the cost of rooftop solar incentives with the state’s rising price of electricity. Their legislation, Senate Bill 4, was passed before the changes to the federal tax credits.
While PURA did consider offering additional incentives for individually-owned systems to offset the loss of the federal tax credits, the commissioners ultimately opted not do so due to the cost and administrative effort required to create those incentives for a limited time period. 
Trahan said that he is planning to ask PURA to reconsider its decision in early 2026.
If the new state charges go into effect along with the loss of federal tax credits, the result for system owners is that it could take another four or five years to recoup their initial investment, according to Sean Riel, the director of residential sales at Ellington’s Earthlight Technologies. Still, he said he remained optimistic that leasing would be seen as viable alternative for customers over the next two years.
“If you’re going with a lease, the pitch there remains the same: that you’re going to be locking in a lower rate for power through purchasing solar energy versus paying the utility,” Riel said. 
PURA did increase price caps and other incentives for non-residential solar systems in 2026 in order to account for the loss of the federal tax credits.
Another change taking effect on Jan. 1 is a new state law dictating that most condo complexes can no longer “prohibit or unreasonably restrict” owners of single-family, detached units from installing solar panels on their roofs. Complexes that wish to opt out of the new requirements must do so by Jan. 1, 2028 with a three-quarters vote of their board.
Andrew Belden, vice president for renewable programs and strategy at Eversource, said that it remains to be seen how customers and the solar industry react to the shifting state and federal policies.
“The industry hasn’t metabolized a change like this, ever,” Belden said. “So, 2026 will be a year when we’re going to find out a lot about how the market is going to react to changes. What we always suggest for customers is to treat solar installation as you would any other home improvement project: shop around, ask questions. There are likely good deals to be had, but there are also challenges.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP23349541550576-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-19 07:57:02.072144

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Avery Ping had a knack for noticing who in a room might be having a bad day and checking in on them. He wanted to be a psychiatrist. 
But the Olympia teen was addicted to his screen, his father Aaron said. He wanted to get away from his phone, and Aaron was adamant about limiting his screen time. 
“For a developing teenage brain, it’s going to be training that brain for impulsive behavior,” Aaron Ping said. “Dopamine reward schedules, it has a really harmful effect on the developing mind.”
Aaron Ping feels that effect is what led Avery to seek out the hallucinogenic drug MDMA on Snapchat in late 2024, leading to his overdose death. He was 16.
Now his father is pushing for a measure in Washington state to set up safeguards for children online.  
House Bill 1834 aims to protect youth in multiple ways. 
It would block companies like Instagram, YouTube and TikTok from providing “addictive feeds” to minors. Youth consumers would still have access to the platforms to search for specific content and follow users they’re interested in.
Under the bill, companies also couldn’t send push notifications to minors overnight or during school hours without parental consent
“It’s really the first step that has to happen before we can start to make it safe online,” Ping said in an interview.
The Senate passed its version of the legislation last year with some bipartisan support, but it stalled in the House amid constitutionality and privacy concerns. The bill comes at the request of state Attorney General Nick Brown. It also had Gov. Bob Ferguson’s support last year.
As attorney general, Ferguson sued TikTok and Meta over the platforms trying to reel in youth users and get them hooked. Both cases are ongoing.
Lawmakers and advocates, including former tech executives, are renewing their push for the state guardrails this year. 
The tech industry isn’t happy.
Rose Feliciano, the executive director of TechNet in the Northwest, said in a statement that the organization “and its member companies are committed to providing safe, age-appropriate online experiences for young people.”
“But we are concerned that the bill, as currently drafted, would limit companies’ ability to offer the full range of parental controls needed to help keep children safe,” said Feliciano, whose organization is made up of a bipartisan network of tech executives. She also noted constitutionality concerns.

TechNet members include Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Meta and Google. 
In a letter to lawmakers Thursday, the tech lobbying group NetChoice said the issue should be left to parents, and that legislation like this replaces “parental judgment with state diktat.” 
Amy Bos, the group’s vice president of government affairs, argued the proposed regulations violate the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. NetChoice prefers focusing on digital literacy and helping parents guide their children’s internet use to address the problem.
Children’s Alliance Executive Director Soleil Boyd said advocates have worked hard to ensure the legislation is “legally defensible and really will make a difference.”
“You bring in these algorithms that really are targeting young people, children and kids to make sure that they stay online for as long as absolutely possible,” Boyd said. “It’s more than most parents can do to really fight and combat that.”
View from the inside
Kelly Stonelake worked at Meta for nearly 15 years, including leading the expansion of the company’s virtual reality software, Horizon Worlds, to kids and teenagers.
For much of her career, Stonelake, who also worked at Apple, believed that her company was going to do right by its consumers. She would’ve argued against overregulation.
But she said it was an open secret within Meta that with Horizon Worlds, children were using a product they weren’t allowed to without parental oversight, meaning the company was collecting their data in violation of federal law. The only concern was for how issues would affect the company, not the young users of the products, she said.
“The executive team got into the product to play test it and kind of understand it better ourselves, but we could not even hear one another over the sounds of screaming children,” Stonelake said.
Stonelake, who lives in Normandy Park, believes she was laid off from Meta in retaliation for raising concerns. She is suing the tech giant over the alleged retaliation and gender discrimination. (Meta didn’t respond to a request for comment.)
She’s now become passionate about working on bills like Washington’s, which she calls “common sense regulations that we need to protect kids.”
“Because I’ve seen firsthand that these companies won’t,” Stonelake said.
In 2023, about 70% of Washington 10th graders reported using social media several times a day. Those students were likely to have worse grades.
Nearly half of 10th graders were at risk of what is called “problematic internet use” that could be risky or impulsive and lead to bad consequences. Those students were likely to get less sleep than their peers. And 8% reported increased social anxiety due to internet use.
“If we can get way upstream and we can prevent it from happening in the first place, and this is exactly that,” said bill sponsor Rep. Lisa Callan, D-Issaquah. “Let’s prevent some anxiety and depression from happening in the first place.”
In 2023, the U.S. Surgeon General recommended policymakers limit social media access to keep youth safe and better protect their privacy online. 
Another bill under consideration in Olympia looks to protect young people online by requiring kids age 16 and younger to get parental consent to make social media accounts. Last year, Democratic lawmakers proposed a new tax on social media companies to fund youth behavioral health care.
The legal state of play
A number of states have enacted legislation tackling this issue, but such laws have faced legal challenges. 
Washington’s measure is modeled after a California ban on addictive feeds that has withstood court scrutiny. Last year, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the law’s requirement of parental consent for minors to access addictive feeds. Meta, Google and TikTok have since sued to block the California law. 
Tech groups like NetChoice argue regulating internet content and restricting what feeds minors can have is unconstitutional. 
Seann Colgan, a state assistant attorney general focused on consumer protection, argued the Washington bill doesn’t run afoul of freedom of speech protections. 
“It doesn’t restrict kids’ access to speech,” Colgan told a state Senate panel Thursday. “Kids can still access the speech, they just need to look for it themselves instead of having it fed to them in an addictive manner.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/instagram-concept-photo-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-19 07:57:02.072144

In negotiations, Henry Ford has insisted on many concessions, but one is particularly painful on this Martin Luther King Jr. Day: eliminating recognition of the holiday for Rochester Hospital employees.
For me, as a Black woman in Metro Detroit, this is not just about a day off. It is about recognition.
Dr. King’s fight for dignity, justice, and economic fairness is the bedrock of the labor movement. To erase this holiday is to dismiss the profound connection between civil rights and workers’ rights.
But this is more than a symbolic insult; it’s a practical misstep that will hurt our hospital. Our Metro Detroit community is already facing a health care staffing crisis. We are struggling to recruit and retain nurses, technicians, and support staff. Telling staff and potential hires, especially in a region as diverse as ours, that we do not value this cornerstone holiday sends a clear message: your values are not our values. It tells my colleagues of color that their heritage and the community’s history are an afterthought.
Henry Ford is pushing for many other concessions that will strain an already stretched workforce. While MLK Day and Good Friday are on the chopping block entirely, hospital executives also want to reduce holiday pay when we work any other holiday, eliminate daily overtime, and reduce paid time off. While the affordability crisis continues to make it harder for hospital staff to make ends meet, Henry Ford has proposed wage increases that leave many behind and, for some, freezes wages for the next year.
Exhausted, undervalued staff cannot provide optimal patient outcomes. Dr. King said, “Of all the forms of inequality, injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane.” By devaluing the workers who are at the heart of this hospital, Henry Ford executives risk perpetuating the very inequalities we strive to heal.
This Martin Luther King Jr. Day, we call on Henry Ford to reconsider.
Show our community, your employees, and every patient who walks through these doors that you truly honor Dr. King’s legacy. Not with empty statements, but with just practices that attract and retain the dedicated staff our patients deserve.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/hopsital-image-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-19 07:57:02.072144

The marchers set out after the original, solo marcher, James Meredith was shot and wounded by a white gunman. Photo by Archive Photos/Getty Images. Your Majesty, your royal highness, Mr. president, excellencies, ladies and gentlemen:
I accept the Nobel Prize for Peace at a moment when 22 million Negroes of the United States of America are engaged in a creative battle to end the long night of racial injustice. I accept this award on behalf of a Civil Rights Movement which is moving with determination and a majestic scorn for risk and danger to establish a reign of freedom and a rule of justice. I am mindful that only yesterday in Birmingham, Alabama, our children, crying out for brotherhood, were answered with fire hoses, snarling dogs and even death. I am mindful that only yesterday in Philadelphia, Mississippi, young people seeking to secure the right to vote were brutalized and murdered. And only yesterday more than 40 houses of worship in the state of Mississippi alone were bombed or burned because they offered a sanctuary to those who would not accept segregation. I am mindful that debilitating and grinding poverty afflicts my people and chains them to the lowest rung of the economic ladder.
Therefore, I must ask why this prize is awarded to a movement which is beleaguered and committed to unrelenting struggle; to a movement which has not won the very peace and brotherhood which is the essence of the Nobel Prize.
After contemplation, I conclude that this award which I receive on behalf of that movement is a profound recognition that nonviolence is the answer to the crucial political and moral question of our time — the need for man to overcome oppression and violence without resorting to violence and oppression. Civilization and violence are antithetical concepts. Negroes of the United States, following the people of India, have demonstrated that nonviolence is not sterile passivity, but a powerful moral force which makes for social transformation. Sooner or later all the people of the world will have to discover a way to live together in peace, and thereby transform this pending cosmic elegy into a creative psalm of brotherhood. If this is to be achieved, man must evolve for all human conflict a method which rejects revenge, aggression and retaliation. The foundation of such a method is love.
The tortuous road which has led from Montgomery, Alabama to Oslo bears witness to this truth. This is a road over which millions of Negroes are travelling to find a new sense of dignity. This same road has opened for all Americans a new era of progress and hope. It has led to a new Civil Rights Bill, and it will, I am convinced, be widened and lengthened into a super highway of justice as Negro and white men in increasing numbers create alliances to overcome their common problems.
I accept this award today with an abiding faith in America and an audacious faith in the future of mankind. I refuse to accept despair as the final response to the ambiguities of history. I refuse to accept the idea that the “isness” of man’s present nature makes him morally incapable of reaching up for the eternal “oughtness” that forever confronts him. I refuse to accept the idea that man is mere flotsam and jetsam in the river of life, unable to influence the unfolding events which surround him. I refuse to accept the view that mankind is so tragically bound to the starless midnight of racism and war that the bright daybreak of peace and brotherhood can never become a reality.
I refuse to accept the cynical notion that nation after nation must spiral down a militaristic stairway into the hell of thermonuclear destruction. I believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word in reality. This is why right temporarily defeated is stronger than evil triumphant. I believe that even amid today’s mortar bursts and whining bullets, there is still hope for a brighter tomorrow. I believe that wounded justice, lying prostrate on the blood-flowing streets of our nations, can be lifted from this dust of shame to reign supreme among the children of men. I have the audacity to believe that peoples everywhere can have three meals a day for their bodies, education and culture for their minds, and dignity, equality and freedom for their spirits. I believe that what self-centered men have torn down men other-centered can build up. I still believe that one day mankind will bow before the altars of God and be crowned triumphant over war and bloodshed, and nonviolent redemptive good will proclaim the rule of the land. “And the lion and the lamb shall lie down together and every man shall sit under his own vine and fig tree and none shall be afraid.” I still believe that we shall overcome!
This faith can give us courage to face the uncertainties of the future. It will give our tired feet new strength as we continue our forward stride toward the city of freedom. When our days become dreary with low-hovering clouds and our nights become darker than a thousand midnights, we will know that we are living in the creative turmoil of a genuine civilization struggling to be born.
Today I come to Oslo as a trustee, inspired and with renewed dedication to humanity. I accept this prize on behalf of all men who love peace and brotherhood. I say I come as a trustee, for in the depths of my heart I am aware that this prize is much more than an honor to me personally.
Every time I take a flight, I am always mindful of the many people who make a successful journey possible — the known pilots and the unknown ground crew.
So you honor the dedicated pilots of our struggle who have sat at the controls as the freedom movement soared into orbit. You honor, once again, Chief Lutuli of South Africa, whose struggles with and for his people, are still met with the most brutal expression of man’s inhumanity to man. You honor the ground crew without whose labor and sacrifices the jet flights to freedom could never have left the earth. Most of these people will never make the headline and their names will not appear in Who’s Who. Yet when years have rolled past and when the blazing light of truth is focused on this marvellous age in which we live – men and women will know and children will be taught that we have a finer land, a better people, a more noble civilization – because these humble children of God were willing to suffer for righteousness’ sake.
I think Alfred Nobel would know what I mean when I say that I accept this award in the spirit of a curator of some precious heirloom which he holds in trust for its true owners – all those to whom beauty is truth and truth beauty – and in whose eyes the beauty of genuine brotherhood and peace is more precious than diamonds or silver or gold.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-800885663.jpg,,,2026-01-19 07:57:02.072144

Each year on the holiday that bears his name, Martin Luther King Jr. is remembered for his immense contributions to the struggle for racial equality. What is less often remembered but equally important is that King saw the fight for racial equality as deeply intertwined with economic justice.
To address inequality – and out of growing concern for how automation might displace workers – King became an early advocate for universal basic income. Under universal basic income, the government provides direct cash payments to all citizens to help them afford life’s expenses.
In recent years, more than a dozen U.S. cities have run universal basic income programs, often smaller or pilot programs that have offered guaranteed basic incomes to select groups of needy residents. As political scientists, we have followed these experiments closely.
One of us recently co-authored a study which found that universal basic income is generally popular. In two out of three surveys analyzed, majorities of white Americans supported a universal basic income proposal. Support is particularly high among those with low incomes.
King’s intuition was that white people with lower incomes would support this type of policy because they could also benefit from it. In 1967, King argued, “It seems to me that the Civil Rights Movement must now begin to organize for the guaranteed annual income … which I believe will go a long, long way toward dealing with the Negro’s economic problem and the economic problem with many other poor people confronting our nation.”
But there is one notable group that does not support universal basic income: those with higher levels of racial resentment. Racial resentment is a scale that social scientists have used to describe and measure anti-Black prejudice since the 1980s.
Notably, in our research, whites with higher levels of racial resentment and higher incomes are especially inclined to oppose universal basic income. As King well knew, this segment of Americans can create powerful opposition.

 Economic self-interest can trump resentment

At the same time, the results of the study also suggest that coalition building is possible, even among the racially resentful.
Economic status matters. Racially resentful whites with lower incomes tend to be supportive of universal basic income. In short, self-interest seems to trump racial resentment. This is consistent with King’s idea of how an economic coalition could be built and pave the way toward racial progress.
Income is not the only thing that shapes attitudes, however. Some of the strongest supporters of universal basic income are those who have higher incomes but low levels of racial resentment. This suggests an opportunity to build coalitions across economic lines, something King believed was necessary. “The rich must not ignore the poor,” he argued in his Nobel Peace Prize lecture, “because both rich and poor are tied in a single garment of destiny.” Our data shows that this is possible.
This approach to coalition building is also suggested by our earlier research. Using American National Election Studies surveys from 2004-2016, we found that for white Americans, racial resentment predicted lower support for social welfare policies. But we also found that economic position mattered, too.
Economic need can unite white Americans in support of more generous welfare policies, including among some who are racially prejudiced. At a minimum, this suggests that racial resentment does not necessarily prevent white Americans from supporting policies that would also benefit Black Americans.
 Building lasting coalitions

During his career as an activist in the 1950s and 1960s, King struggled with building long-term, multiracial coalitions. He understood that many forms of racial prejudice could undermine his work. He therefore sought strategies that could forge alliances across lines of difference. He helped build coalitions of poor and working-class Americans, including those who are white. He was not so naive as to think that shared economic progress would eliminate racial prejudice, but he saw it as a place to start.
Currently, the nation faces an affordability crisis, and artificial intelligence poses new threats to jobs. These factors have increased calls for universal basic income.
Racial prejudice continues to fuel opposition to universal basic income, as well as other forms of social welfare. But our research suggests that this is not insurmountable.
As King knew, progress toward economic equality is not inevitable. But, as his legacy reminds us, progress does remain possible through organizing around shared interests.

Detroit was the first place Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered an early version of what would become his “I Have a Dream” speech. He recited it on June 23, 1963, at the end of Detroit’s Walk to Freedom, a march that happened weeks before he spoke on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C.
This piece of Detroit-first history sharpens what Martin Luther King Jr. Day asks of the city. It’s harder to treat the holiday, celebrated on Monday, as a slogan when the dream was first spoken aloud in Detroit. It’s also harder to see it as a day off when a lot of people choose to mark it every year as a day on.
The Lambda Pi Omega (LPO) chapter of the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated, is one of the Detroit institutions built around that belief.
Their members measure the weeks before Martin Luther King Jr. Day in labor. They assemble toiletry kits for Detroiters without stable housing, volunteer their time to youth programs focused on combating hunger and fostering leadership skills, and step into the gaps families are already navigating, like hunger and lack of resources. Crystal Sewell, the chapter’s president, said the work is rooted in service that isn’t just a once-a-year thing.
“Our work really is about uplifting our community; that is really at the heart of what we do,” Sewell said. “It is sisterhood and service for the betterment of our local community, that’s really the essence and the spirit of our chapter.”
This year, LPO will spend Martin Luther King Jr. Day at Third New Hope Baptist Church on Detroit’s west side for its annual “We Are One” AKA Day of Service. Sorority members plan to assemble 1,908 toiletry bags for Detroit Rescue Mission Ministries, a local nonprofit that provides emergency shelter and support services, including housing programs for families and people working toward recovery. The specificity in the number of kits is intentional: 1,908 reflects AKA’s founding year, 1908. After the event, the bags will be delivered to the rescue mission’s family shelter and recovery housing sites.
The chapter’s service calendar stays full throughout the year, Sewell said.
“If I were to add it up, I would say we participate in at least 10 volunteer opportunities per month,” she said. “So, you’re talking 100 to 150 volunteer service opportunities per year. There are several hours that go into our volunteerism, over 2,000 hours per year.”
LPO is part of the Divine Nine — nine historically Black fraternities and sororities under the National Pan-Hellenic Council, founded when Black students, excluded from White Greek systems, created their own organizations around scholarship, leadership and service.
Dr. King was part of that tradition.
He was initiated into Boston’s Sigma chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha in June 1952. Alpha Phi Alpha (APA) was founded in 1906 as the first Black Greek-letter fraternity; AKA is the first Black Greek-letter sorority.
AKA’s purpose statement includes a directive members repeat as a standard: to be of “service to all mankind.”
Jacqueline Newman has spent decades living by that. She became an AKA member in 1970 at Wayne State University. When the sorority’s LPO chapter was chartered in Detroit in 1977, she became a founding charter member. She now serves as the chapter historian.
“What we do is we try to help, whenever we can, wherever we can,” Newman said. “We love children, so we are in different schools to help feed students. We’ve clothed students. We’ve given Thanksgiving baskets. We’ve given scholarships, and it was not only to women or girls. It has been to men also. And no matter your race. That’s what I look at as service to all mankind, to all people that are in need. That’s what we do.”
Newman’s own timeline begins in the South. She was 13 and living in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, when Dr. King spoke in Detroit in 1963.
“I was part of the South that he was trying to free from civil rights injustices,” she said.

She moved to Detroit in 1965 with her family. “My mom and my dad were teachers and the employment was better here in Detroit,” Newman said. Her mother became a member of AKA in 1962; Newman described her own membership as legacy. “So, it was mainly a legacy for me. I followed in my mom’s footsteps.”
Her history of service began before she joined AKA. In the South, she said, “I saw so many injustices done, especially to our people. I was marching and doing civil rights things when I was 11, 12, 13 years old before I came here to Michigan.”
Those experiences compelled her to action — “you don’t want anybody else to have to go through what you went through,” Newman said.
“When you have seen a man hung on a tree, it hits you a little more,” Newman said. “If you have lived through it, it’s different.”
Detroit remembers Dr. King’s dream speech because it heard it early. Lambda Pi Omega is betting its Martin Luther King Jr. Day on a simpler goal: what gets done, who gets served, and whether the work continues when the holiday ends.
As Sewell said, service is about direct support and long-term civic work.
“Service for me is about uplifting others within our community who are of greatest need,” she said. “It is advocating for social justice, making sure our community is informed and educated and registered to vote and getting out to vote, thinking about the whole of the individual, from cradle to senior.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AKA-service03-1024x683.webp,,,2026-01-19 07:57:02.072144

(Katherine Frey/The Washington Post via Getty Images)Since 1983, when President Ronald Reagan signed Martin Luther King Jr. Day into law, many Americans have observed the federal holiday to commemorate the life and legacy of the civil rights leader, Baptist minister and theologian.

MLK Day volunteers typically perform community service that continues King’s fight to end racial discrimination and economic injustice – to build the “beloved community,” as he often said.
King does not fully explain the phrase’s meaning in his published writings, speeches and sermons. Scholars Rufus Burrow Jr. and Lewis V. Baldwin, however, argue that the beloved community is King’s principal ethical goal, guiding the struggle against what he called the “three evils of American society”: racism, economic exploitation and militarism.
As a Baptist minister and theologian myself, I believe it is important to understand the origins of the concept of the beloved community, how King understood it and how he worked to make it a reality.
Older origins
Although King popularized the beloved community, the phrase has roots in the thought of 19th-century American religious philosopher Josiah Royce.
In 1913, toward the end of his long career, Royce published “The Problem of Christianity.” The book compiles lectures on the Christian religion, including the idea of the church and its mission, and coined the term beloved community. Based on his readings of the biblical gospels, as well as the writings of the apostle Paul, Royce argued that the beloved community was one where individuals are transformed by God’s love.



				This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license. Read the original article.			


In turn, members express that love as loyalty toward each other – for example, the devoted love a member of the church would have toward the church as a whole.
While Royce often identified the beloved community with the church, he extends the concept beyond the walls of Christianity. In any type of community, Royce argued, from clans to nations, there are individuals who express love and devotion not only to their own community, but who foster a sense of the community that includes all humankind.
According to Royce, the ideal or beloved community is a “universal community” – one to which all human beings belong or will eventually belong at the end of time.
‘Beloved’ diversity
Twentieth-century pastor, philosopher, mystic, theologian and civil rights leader Howard Thurman retrieved Royce’s idea of the beloved community and applied it to his life and work, most notably in his 1971 book “The Search for Common Ground.”
Thurman first used the term in an unpublished and undated article: Desegregation, Integration, and the Beloved Community. Here, he argued that the beloved community cannot be achieved by sheer will or commanded by force. Rather, it begins with transformation in each person’s “human spirit.” The seeds of the beloved community extend outward into society as each person assumes the responsibility of bringing it to pass.
Thurman envisioned the beloved community as one that exemplifies harmony – harmony enriched by members’ diversity. It is a community wherein people from all racial, national, religious and ethnic backgrounds are respected, and where their human dignity is affirmed. Thurman was convinced that beloved community was achievable because of the dedication he saw from activists during the struggle for racial integration.
During his lifetime, Thurman sought to build this beloved community through his activism for racial justice. For example, he co-founded the Church for the Fellowship of All Peoples, an interracial and interfaith community in San Francisco, which he co-pastored from 1943 to 1953.
Thurman’s writings and activism deeply influenced King. Burrow argued that it is not entirely clear when and where King first learned the concept of beloved community. Yet King emphasized its importance in much of his writing and political action.
Love and action
In simplest terms, King defined the beloved community as a community transformed by love. Like Royce, he drew his understanding of love from the Bible’s New Testament. In the original Greek, the Gospels use the word “agape,” which suggests God’s self-giving, unconditional love for humanity – and, by extension, human beings’ self-giving, unconditional love for each other.

According to Baldwin, however, King’s understanding of the beloved community is better understood against the backdrop of the Black church tradition. Raised in the Ebenezer Baptist Church of Atlanta, King learned lessons on the meaning of love from his parents, Rev. Martin Luther King Sr. – Ebenezer’s pastor, who was also a leader in the local chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People – and Alberta Christine Williams King.
One of the distinctions in King’s thought is that he believed the beloved community could be achieved through nonviolent direct action, such as sit-ins, marches and boycotts. In part, he was inspired by Thurman, who had embraced the nonviolence at the heart of Mahatma Gandhi’s resistance against the British in India. For King, nonviolence was the only viable means for achieving the United States of America’s redemption from the sin of racial segregation and white supremacy.
For King, therefore, the beloved community was not merely a utopian vision of the future. He envisioned it as an obtainable ethical goal that all human beings must work collectively toward achieving.
“Only a refusal to hate or kill can put an end to the chain of violence in the world and lead us toward a community where men can live together without fear,” King wrote in 1966. “Our goal is to create a beloved community and this will require a qualitative change in our souls as well as a quantitative change in our lives.”
King’s idea of the beloved community has not only influenced people affiliated with the Christian tradition but also people from other faiths and none.
For instance, scholars Elizabeth A. Johnson, bell hooks and Joy James have reflected upon the meaning of the beloved community amid ongoing challenges such as global climate change, sexism, racism and other forms of structural violence.
People around the world continue to draw insight and inspiration from King’s thought, especially from his insistence that love is “the most durable power” to change the world for the better. Questions remain about whether his beloved community can be realized, or how. But I believe it is important to understand King’s ethical concept and its continuing influence on movements that seek an end to injustice.

(Photo by STATEHOUSE CAROLINA/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — With two months to go before candidates must file to be on this year’s ballots, the state Democratic Party made a plea.
“RUN FOR OFFICE in 2026,” reads the top of an email sent Jan. 7 from state Democratic Party Chairwoman Christale Spain.
Democrats have announced bids for just two of the seven elected constitutional offices on the ballot this November: governor and state superintendent of education. The party is still talking with potential candidates, Spain told the SC Daily Gazette.
In her email, she pointed to that week’s slim margin of victory for Republican Greg Ford in a special election for a state House seat representing Dorchester County. He defeated Democrat Sonja Ogletree Satani by just 21 votes, as determined by an automatic recount.
Ogletree Satani “ran one heck of a race,” Spain wrote, noting that President Donald Trump won the district by over 6 percentage points in 2024. (Statewide, he won by 18 points.) “The lesson to all of us is that we can compete and win if we run!”
The email was successful, Spain told the Gazette on Wednesday.
In one week, more than a hundred people filled out the candidate interest form attached to that email. “Dozens” of them checked a box showing interest in seeking a statewide office, according to Jon Burton, a party spokesperson.


Upcoming deadlines
To compete in the June 9 party primaries, candidates must file the forms and pay the required fees between March 16 and March 30.
The fee is 1% of the job’s salary over the entire term.
For constitutional offices, that ranges from $4,243 for gubernatorial candidates to $8,560 to run for state superintendent.


It’s been 32 years since a Democrat competed for every statewide elected office in the South Carolina constitution. And back in 1994, there were two additional offices on the ballot.
The party has come close to having a candidate for every office since.
In 2006, a Democrat ran for every statewide office except attorney general. Then-Attorney General Henry McMaster ran unopposed for re-election that year.
In 2002, the only constitutional office without a Democrat running was adjutant general, the leader of the state’s military department. Maj. Gen. Stan Spears ran unopposed that year. He easily defeated a Democrat in 2006 for his fourth and final term before retiring. In 2014, voters approved taking that office off the ballot and making it a governor-appointed position.
Also in 2014, McMaster was the last lieutenant governor elected separately, as per a change voters approved two years earlier.
Asked about Spain’s email, state GOP Chairman Drew McKissick said Democrats’ problem “isn’t a lack of candidates.
“It’s that voters simply aren’t buying what they’re selling,” he said in a statement to the SC Daily Gazette.
Two races with both parties on the ballot
A Democrat last won a statewide office in 2006, when Jim Rex was elected state superintendent of education by fewer than 500 votes.
This year, two Democrats, Lisa Ellis and Sylvia Wright, are running for the job overseeing the state agency for K-12 public schools. Whoever wins the June 9 Democratic primary will likely face Superintendent Ellen Weaver, who’s running for her second term. So far, no Republican has announced a challenge.
In 2022, the race for superintendent was the most crowded: Six Republicans and three Democrats ran to replace outgoing Superintendent Molly Spearman.
Ellis was a first-time candidate then. The 25-year veteran teacher of Richland 2 high schools, who in 2018 founded the online teachers’ group SC for Ed, won a three-way primary outright without needing a runoff, then lost to Weaver by 16 percentage points. In 2023, SC for Ed announced an indefinite pause to its lobbying efforts, four years after organizing a teachers’ rally at the Statehouse attended by an estimated 10,000 people.
Wright, who has two decades of classroom and administrative experience, resigned from her job last fall as a district coordinator for Dorchester 4 in order to campaign full-time.
Among all the statewide races on the ballot this year, the wide-open governor’s race has by far gotten the most attention.
It’s been 16 years since no incumbent ran for governor. Five Republicans and two Democrats have announced bids to replace Gov. Henry McMaster, who first ascended to the job nine years ago when then-Gov. Nikki Haley joined President Donald Trump’s first administration. So, when voters first elected McMaster to the job in 2018, he’d already been governor almost two years.
In South Carolina, governors are limited to two elected terms. Other constitutional offices have no term limitations.
Two other offices are wide open
Two other statewide offices that have gotten little attention are wide open for the first time in over two decades.
Agriculture Commissioner Hugh Weathers is not seeking a sixth full term. It’s been 16 years since a Democrat challenged him.
Voters first elected Weathers in 2006, two years after Gov. Mark Sanford appointed the Orangeburg County dairy farmer to the job following the indictment of Charlie Sharpe, who was eventually sentenced to two years in prison for taking a bribe to protect a cockfighting ring.
Weathers endorsed Republican Fred West to replace him, The State newspaper reported last March. West retired in 2023 after 24 years as an executive at the poultry processing company Amick Farms and his since become director of market development at the Department of Agriculture.
So far, West is the only candidate to announce a bid to lead the agency with duties that include promoting one of the state’s top industries, keeping the food supply safe, and — since 2024 — handling all inspections of places that sell food, such as restaurants and cafeterias.
The job of comptroller general is open for the first time in 28 years, when then-Sen. Jim Landers replaced the retiring Earle Morris Jr.
That 1998 election was also the last time a Democrat won the post as the state’s chief accountant. In 2002, Republican Richard Eckstrom ousted Landers and kept the job for 21 years. Eckstrom resigned in 2023 amid mounting pressure over his office’s $3.5 billion accounting error. (The error was strictly on paper. No money went missing. The office mistakenly double-counted some agencies’ revenue.)
McMaster made history in appointing his budget director, Brian Gaines, who by agreeing to run the office temporarily became South Carolina’s first Black constitutional officer since Reconstruction. Gaines said at the time he had no interest in running in 2026.
One Republican has announced a bid: Mike Burkhold, a Charleston County businessman who founded Equiscript, a health care technology company.
For two other statewide offices, Republicans are seeking re-election without any announced competition.
Secretary of State Mark Hammond, first elected in 2002, is seeking a seventh term leading the office that registers and helps regulate businesses and charities operating in South Carolina. (Unlike in other states, South Carolina’s secretary of state plays no role at all in overseeing elections.)
Treasurer Curtis Loftis, first elected in 2010, also came under fire recently for accounting problems. Senate investigations into the comptroller general’s office led to discovery of a $1.8 billion error in the treasurer’s office — also a blunder on paper that didn’t affect state revenues or the Legislature’s budgeting process. An outside accounting firm found that all but $200 million never existed. But senators were incensed, voting 33 to 8 last April to remove him. The House, however, never took up the case.
Amid a grilling from senators, Loftis initially pledged that he would not seek re-election in 2026. But he later reversed course and announced he’s seeking a fifth term. He maintains that he did nothing wrong.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Sahra Sharif, a mother of 16 and owner of an apparel shop at Madina Mall in Minneapolis, said her new routine is to open at 3 p.m. and stay open for about four hours, hoping to cover the month’s rent. 
Due to a fear of immigration agents, “The entire shopping mall is completely empty because people rarely come out of their homes,” she said. 
With the food, utility, and rent for both the shop and her flat looming, Sahra picked up a side job caring for a person with a disability. The job also went unpaid, however, after the state’s latest anti-fraud effort delayed payment to home care agencies.  
“I was hoping to get a few checks already, but I haven’t gotten even one yet,” she said.
She said she started her business 10 years ago and never thought she would go back to being an employee.
This is life for many Minnesota immigrants these days in President Donald Trump’s America. 
Since the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement stepped up raids and random stops last month, three of Sharif’s family members have been arrested. Her son was deported to Somalia; a cousin is a permanent resident who was released; and the other is still in custody, she said.  
“In my family, people rarely go outside unless it’s absolutely necessary; and if anyone does, it is considered a reckless thing to do,” she said.
Imam Yusuf Abdulle, executive director of the Islamic Association of North America, said fear of ICE has changed many immigrants’ daily routines.
Social gatherings have vanished, parents advise their young adult children to stay home, and short walks and unnecessary trips have become a thing of the past.

“The Somali community heavily depends on each other’s mutual support, so if people remain indoors, that will impact everyone,” Abdulle said. “That’s why we encourage people to come together and support each other.”
Moreover, most Somali Minnesotans are U.S. citizens, so Abdulle and other community leaders are encouraging people to resume their normal routines.
But because ICE’s approach seems to be “detain first, identify later,” no one wants to take a risk, even U.S. citizens.  
For many young Somali Americans, the stress caused by ICE has led to confusion and doubt about why they and their family are being stopped, questioned and at times detained.  
“Some of them worry if their parents will return home,” Abdulle said.
Many young people born and raised in the U.S. are forced to carry their passports, while white teens do not. The implicit racism takes a toll on them, Abdulle said.
Despite the confusion and fear, the immigrant community is finding strength by helping each other through ride-sharing, picking up groceries, paying rent, and running errands for those who lost their jobs due to fear of being detained, are afraid to go out or don’t have proper documentation. 
For the newly isolated, however, their struggles are unseen. Abdulle is urging them to contact their nearest mosque or community center for help.
‘Workers don’t come to work anymore’ 
The Latino community is also struggling under the federal glare, especially because their rate of citizenship is far lower. 
Jerardo Rivera, an owner of a painting company, said fear has rippled through the community. 
“Workers don’t come to work anymore,” he said. After ICE repeatedly showed up at construction and other job sites, many in his community are in hiding due to fear of being arrested and thrown out of the country overnight. 
“Everyone in my family is a U.S. citizen, but we are still scared. Because if ICE is killing a white U.S. citizen, do you think an immigrant would stand a chance?” he asked, referring to the recent killing of Renee Good by federal officer Jonathan Ross.
Rivera said he worries about his family and community given ICE’s near limitless power to detain and deport. 
A truck driver watches a city suffer under federal weight
Mohamed Ali, a truck driver, said he is not always in the cities, but in the past month or so, he was shocked by how Minneapolis went from a vibrant city with businesses, cafes and social gatherings to a place that now looks unfamiliar. 
“I went to Karmel Mall to get a haircut at 3 p.m., the busiest time in the mall, but I couldn’t find a single barbershop open,” he said.
Mohamud Abdi, a Minneapolis resident, said that the new community norm is to stay hidden because even those with documents are reluctant to interact with ICE for fear of something going terribly wrong. 
“They call it law enforcement, but there is nothing lawful about the things that they are enforcing,” Abdi said.
Abdi compared the current situation to the administration of former President Barack Obama, which deported 3 million people from the U.S., more than any other president in American history, but as Abdi noted, Obama did so without hurting so many innocent people or putting a city like Minneapolis under siege.
Voting for Trump — and regretting it
Sharif, the Madina Mall shop owner who fears she may have to return to the bad old days of having a boss, gave out an exasperated sigh. 
“Would you believe if I told you I voted for this man?” she said, referring to Trump.
Sharif is not politically active, but in 2024, some campaigners came to her shop and told her that Trump would be good for business and against the LGBTQ agenda. 
“I was immediately hooked,” she said. She voted Republican for the first time.
Now, chagrined, she said, “I never thought the man I put in office would come for my family, make me financially struggle and cause me so much fear that I carry my passport when I go to the bathroom,” she said, pointing at the mall’s bathrooms.
“I feel as though the weapon I built is coming to kill me and my people,” she said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/NN251208_223-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-19 07:57:02.072144

Lawyers for Planned Parenthood and the Missouri Attorney General’s Office are dissecting dozens of Missouri’s Targeted Regulation of Abortion, or TRAP laws, as a judge decides which, if any, should remain in place. The safety of abortion is at the heart of the debate.
As the trial enters its second week on Tuesday in Jackson County, the state is trying to make the case that the potential for complications justifies strict regulations on abortion providers. 
“The risks associated with abortion don’t just exist in the abstract,” said Assistant Solicitor General Alexandria Overcash. “Real women, Missouri women have suffered.”
Experts called by Planned Parenthood say that’s not the case. Abortion, they said, presents less risk than many medical procedures, including child birth.
“But there’s nothing like sitting in your patient’s pool of blood as she’s bleeding out four liters of blood to realize that a healthy term pregnancy has a whole hell of a lot of risk,” Dr. Jennifer Smith, an OB-GYN in St. Louis, testified Friday.
Jennifer Smith, an OBGYN, speaks about medical challenges without legal abortions in Missouri in 2024 (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
Missouri voters approved a constitutional amendment in 2024 overturning the state’s abortion ban and enacting protections for reproductive health care. Planned Parenthood and the ACLU of Missouri quickly filed a lawsuit seeking to repeal abortion regulations it argues now violate the new constitutional amendment. The 10-day trial in the case began last week.
Among the laws being challenged is a requirement that only doctors provide abortions, a ban on prescribing medication abortion through telehealth, facility licensing requirements, admitting privileges and a written transfer agreement at a nearby hospital and a state-approved complication plan for medication abortions. 
These regulations eventually halted nearly all access to abortion in Missouri as more and more women seeking to terminate a pregnancy sought care in Illinois and Kansas. By the time Missouri’s abortion ban went into effect in 2022, thousands of Missourians were already leaving the state each year to end their pregnancies. 
The Missouri Attorney General’s Office is seeking to access records for patients who traveled to Planned Parenthood clinics in Illinois and Kansas for abortions and experienced a complication.
In December, the state tried to impose sanctions to force Planned Parenthood to turn over these patient complication reports. Planned Parenthood refused, saying the records would violate patient privacy. A separate judge intervened, ordering the clinics to only turn over a summary chart outlining the complications. The state is appealing this decision.
Over the past decade, nearly 29,000 Missourians had abortions at Planned Parenthood clinics in Kansas City, Kansas, Overland Park, and Pittsburg, Emily Wales, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, testified Tuesday. Of 28,764 who had abortions between 2015 and 2024, 248 had complications as defined by the state, bringing the complication rate to .86%, according to data later provided by Planned Parenthood to The Independent.  
“We are significantly better when it comes to complication rates than the national average,” Wales said, noting that the complication rate for Missouri women at each of the three clinics is regularly under 1% and has been for the past decade. 
Deputy Solicitor General Peter Donohue asked if some patients had to have follow-up procedures at local hospitals, and if Planned Parenthood Great Plains has advised patients to go to the ER? 
Yes, Wales said, but they’ve never had to transport a patient from a clinic to a hospital.
Abortion trial details how laws drove providers from Missouri Planned Parenthood clinics

Under state law, Planned Parenthood must report any abortion complications to the health department. But how the health department and how Planned Parenthood defines complications differs.  
In 2022, the most recent year Department of Health and Senior Services data is available, 115 complications were reported. Fifty-five involved procedural abortions, which happen in-clinic, and 60 were the result of medication abortions.
Gillian Wilcox, litigation director for the ACLU of Missouri, said state attorneys were misrepresenting the safety of abortions and said the practice doesn’t necessitate special regulations. 
“All medical care carries risk of complications. And when you look at it in isolation, you don’t get a full picture,” Wilcox said in an interview. “Because when you get the full picture it is that they are providing thousands of abortions. And the complication rate actually percentage-wise is very low.” 
Complications associated with abortion included hemorrhaging, fever, uterine perforation, pregnancy tissue left in the uterus, cervical lacerations, incomplete abortion and failed abortion. 
The latter, which is a circumstance where the abortion doesn’t work and the pregnancy continues, is not generally considered a complication, but rather a possible outcome, Dr. Daniel Grossman, director of Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health based at the University of California-San Francisco, testified Tuesday.
State-mandated complication reporting requirements “create the impression that abortion is riskier than it really is,” said Grossman, who is a liaison to Planned Parenthood’s National Medical Committee.
Missouri is one of 27 states that requires providers to submit complication reports.
Grossman pointed to a section on the complication report marked “death.”
Bleeding and cramping are expected side effects of both medication and procedural abortions. Hemorrhaging and infection are among the rare complications. 
Since mifepristone was approved for use in medication abortions 28 years ago, 32 deaths have been associated with its use, according to the Federal Drug Administration. The FDA evaluated data from 5.9 million women who took mifepristone between 2000 and 2022. Of the three dozen deaths, 11 were the result of sepsis, 20 were homicides and two were suicides.
Ingrid Skop, an OB-GYN in Texas and a board member at the anti-abortion Charlotte Lozier Institute, was called to testify Friday by the Attorney General’s Office. She has treated dozens of women for abortion complications, Skop said, and she believes national data is lacking.
“It appears safer than it actually is,” she said.
That’s because abortion clinics are not generally mandated to report complications, Skop said. 
Complications can happen after women leave clinics, and women presenting in hospital emergency rooms do not always tell doctors about their abortions. Skop said abortion providers do little follow up, unlike a routine doctor that has built a relationship with their patients. 
“The assumption seems to be no news is good news,” she said of abortion providers who may not hear from patients after procedural or medication abortions.
On cross examination, a plaintiff’s attorney noted that Skop has never performed abortions and disagrees with mainstream medical associations like the American Medical Association and the American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists. Skop was also questioned about the fact that several of her articles were retracted for methodology issues from peer-reviewed journals, though she maintained those were politically motivated moves.

On Thursday, Overcash questioned Margot Riphagan, Planned Parenthood Great Rivers president and CEO, extensively about complications.
Overcash entered into evidence a spreadsheet summarizing complications reported among the nearly 24,000 Missourians who traveled to Planned Parenthood’s clinic in Fairview Heights for abortions in the last decade. Planned Parenthood later told The Independent there were 418 complications among 24,350 Missourians at the clinic between 2015 and 2024, or a 1.72% complication rate as defined by the state.
Overcash then highlighted nine instances of ectopic pregnancies, a dangerous condition in which a fertilized egg grows outside the uterus that, if left untreated, can lead to death. 
Doctors testifying on behalf of Planned Parenthood said taking mifepristone doesn’t increase a patient’s risk of dying from an ectopic pregnancy. The symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy, including abdominal pain, would disqualify someone from being able to be prescribed medication abortion without first seeing a doctor in-person.
Two people over three decades have died from ruptured ectopic pregnancies after taking mifepristone, according to the FDA. The FDA reported an additional 95 cases of mifepristone taken during an ectopic pregnancy. The patients were hospitalized in a majority of those cases. 
Overcash also pointed to several cases documenting failed or incomplete abortions in which the patient later chose to stay pregnant. 
“So once again, a woman decided to continue her pregnancy?” she asked.
“It’s critical that women make decisions about their own bodies, yes” Riphagan responded.
Missouri Attorney General Catherine Hanaway, who was appointed to the job in September, made her first appearance at the trial Thursday afternoon. 
“There are real concerns about the safety for women if these treatments are not medically supervised in the appropriate way,” she told The Independent. 
Asked whether the state viewed abortion as unsafe Hanaway said: “Remember, we all have a job, which is to represent the state. And these are the laws that were adopted by the state, and we’re defending them.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_0807-1024x596.jpg,,,2026-01-19 07:57:02.072144

A Highway Patrol trooper’s sexual abuse of a fellow officer at a work conference. A lawsuit between prominent St. Louis attorneys.
All of these cases were removed from Missouri’s public court database. Searching for them online, it appeared as if they never existed.
Cases assigned a high enough “security level” can’t be viewed by the public through Missouri’s online courts database or in person at courthouses. Judges who assign a security level of five, for example, have needed virtually no justification to make these cases disappear.
“Sometimes, the parties might request security level five as part of a settlement, or something like that,” said Dan Curry, an attorney for the Missouri Press Association. “Because one or both, plaintiff and the defendant, don’t want to have whatever happened in the court be easily found.”
Curry said unless the news media or members of the public are following a security level five case, it’s a “whole lot harder” to see what’s happening.
A case can also be removed for days before trial to prevent jurors from accessing documents. While people involved with the cases can still get access, a lack of clarity surrounding how the system works leads to reports of people missing hearings and wrongly thinking charges were dropped.
When cases are sealed at a certain security level, members of the public and journalists can’t even verify their existence. Some unsealed examples identified by the Columbia Missourian contain information pertaining to public servants and officials. The mere existence of these cases — and any related allegations — was previously hidden.
This can conflict with the idea of open courts that Curry said is important to democracy.
“Especially if you read through some of the case law in Missouri and what’s in the constitution about open courts and open records, then I think (lawyers) would know … not only is it a good idea for a democracy, but also legally in Missouri, these things should be open as a default setting,” he said.
 What are security levels?

Missouri court cases are given a security level ranging from one to nine. A level one means the case or document is fully open to the public, whereas a level nine is reserved for cases made confidential after expungement.
The meaning of each security level is specified on The Missouri Bar’s website. Cases might be confidential because they involve juvenile matters. Or maybe they were entered in error. Many levels have a list of three possible scenarios they could be used for.
Security level five is an exception. The only explanation written for level five is “cases under court order.”
When a case is assigned a security level of five, it disappears completely from Missouri’s public court database. That includes information such as the name of the case, scheduling for future hearings and the final judgment.
In an order published Dec. 16, the Supreme Court of Missouri outlined new requirements for sealing cases set to take effect July 1. The standards state sealing records should “overcome a presumption that judicial records should be open for public inspection.”
Curry outlined his thoughts on the order in a column for the Missouri Press Association. He wrote certain changes could make it easier to access records by specifying rules that were previously open-ended.
However, one rule change may make access harder. The order lists 19 types of records that are automatically confidential. Curry wrote the first 18 items are specific and consistent with state law, but the last is a “catch-all” that appears to not require judges to find compelling justification for closure.
The specific wording of record type 19 is: “Any other record sealed, expunged, or closed by statute, Supreme Court rule, or order of a court of record.”
“The worry is this — in some ways the new rules make it easier for a court to close files than before,” Curry wrote. “If a judge desires to make case records confidential, the rules place no conditions or constraints on that decision. This could lead to case files continuing to disappear.”
In a news release, court officials said “over the coming months, the Court plans to provide additional information to help ensure consistent and successful implementation of the rule revisions.”
Under the current rules, if one tries to search using a level five case’s number online, a red error pops up reading, “Your query returned no matches to be viewed at this site. Please try another search or contact the court directly.”
Contacting the court directly yields similar results. On a phone call attempting to get information and documents, court staff repeatedly told Columbia Missourian reporters they couldn’t know anything as the cases were under security level five.
One employee said to a reporter, “I’m not even sure how you got the case number.”
Cases under security level five are hidden unless a judge unseals them. Sometimes, this happens as a situation draws media attention.
One example involved a 2023 lawsuit between political candidates. Former state Rep. Justin Hicks sued Max Calfo, who was running for his seat, for publishing images from a 2010 case in which Hicks was accused of grabbing a woman by the neck and choking her.
Judge Christopher McDonough sealed the politician’s lawsuit at a security level of five, according to court documents. The judge’s order contained the reasoning that “permitting public access to this cause would invariably reveal the existence of the confidential records.”
The case was later unsealed after garnering significant media attention.
Years ago, one of Curry’s clients was offered money in a settlement agreement. A condition of the agreement was raising the security level. Curry said especially if someone has hospital bills, they can be incentivized to accept conditions like raising the security level despite being proponents for open courts.
“If it’s a big enough money, a big enough amount of money for the plaintiffs, for the victim or the injured party, you know, maybe they need that money for medical care,” he said. “Maybe they need that money for housing. There’s real life consequences.”
 Upcoming jury trials

Judges sometimes raise the security level on cases shortly before a jury trial is scheduled. The reasoning is often that if public, jurors could look up information before the trial.
One example from Boone County involves a Missouri State Highway Patrol trooper found guilty of sexually abusing a police officer and preventing her from leaving a hotel room during a work conference.
According to the Missouri courts database, this case was put under a security level of three for 10 days around the time of the trial.
While different from level five, William Hux, court administrator for Missouri’s 13th judicial circuit, wrote in an email level three also prevents the public from viewing cases. Involved parties retain access, he wrote.
People involved with cases can still be negatively impacted by a lack of clarity around the security level process. Finding specific information can be difficult when the mere existence of cases disappears from public searches online.
Amanda Mendez, editor-in-chief of the Howell County News in rural, southern Missouri, said she’s had several community members reach out after cases disappeared from the public courts database.
One woman told Mendez she missed her divorce hearing because her case’s security level was upgraded. The woman, Mendez said, was unable to view her case online and didn’t know how to find information on scheduling.
In another instance, Mendez said the family of a victim of child sex abuse was spun into panic, thinking charges were suddenly dropped.
As for cases disappearing before trial, Doug Thomson was previously a trial judge in Nodaway County, which has roughly 12% the population of Boone County. He said jurors accessing cases or even driving to crime scenes is an elevated concern in rural counties.
Much of that is due to the fact rural counties simply have fewer cases, so jurors are either told or can figure out the specific cases they’re being summoned for ahead of time.
“You simply have to understand that if we’ve got a jury trial coming up, and it’s a small county, it’s kind of a big deal,” Thomson said.
When jurors looked up cases ahead of time, Thomson said they were questioned by the court during the selection process to decide if they should be allowed to stay in the jury.
Thomson sits on the Missouri Press-Bar Commission, a group intended to “foster better communications between the media and the bench and bar,” according to its website. He said through that work, the disappearing cases were recently brought to his attention.
“All of a sudden, there’s just simply nothing there,” Thomson said. “But there is a reason sometimes, you know, at least in my experience in a small county.”
In the Dec. 16 order, the Missouri Supreme Court updated rules to say future cases will not be restricted ahead of jury trials without a “court order setting forth specific written findings supporting a compelling justification to restrict access.”
 Inconsistent labeling

Identifying what security level a case was set at can be difficult due to inconsistent documentation. In the example of the former Highway Patrol trooper, Missouri’s public court database lists in plain text the case would be at security level three and on what specific days.
Finding the security level of the politician’s lawsuit is a little harder. It’s not written anywhere on the case’s online profile. Instead, the case level is listed in the judge’s order to seal, which ends with, “This Cause is to remain under seal, at level five.”
Those are both situations in which the security level could be identified by the public after the case was unsealed. Many times, it can’t.
In a suspected security level five or three case from St. Charles County involving a murder, no level was listed online or in any available documents. Columbia Missourian reporters got access to both the motion to increase the security level and the judge’s order granting it.
However, neither document mentioned the specific level — just that it was raised. The court employee who provided the documents wrote in an email there was no way to determine the level.
A similar situation exists in a 2022 lawsuit against prominent St. Louis attorney Jerome Schlichter.
According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, all traces of the lawsuit were completely removed from the Missouri public courts database. Even so, no documents related to the sealing or unsealing are linked online, such as was the case with the politician’s lawsuit.
Paper copies of the motion to seal, order to seal and order to unseal received from the Civil Courts Building in St. Louis once again do not list the specific security level, only that it was raised and dropped back down.
Because of the freedom judges have to assign these levels, Curry said their use can vary greatly court-to-court. Some judges do not seal cases ahead of upcoming jury trials, like Thomson did.
Whether the newly revised court rules will make a significant difference in the sealing of records won’t be known until they go into effect in July and could depend on what additional guidance is provided.
“Throughout the extensive analysis we have undertaken, our ultimate goal has been to clarify the nature of confidential information and to simplify the redaction process,” Chief Justice W. Brent Powell said in a news release. “We believe today’s order will result in better access to public court records while protecting any truly confidential information they may contain.”
Under the current use of the guidelines, sometimes judges ordered security levels to drop after attracting media attention. Sometimes, the cases unsealed after a trial concluded. And in some cases, they still remain closed to the public.
“Judges are such a wide array of personalities and perspectives and thoughts on the matter,” Curry said. “I’m sure there’ll be some judges who would say, ‘Hey, if this gets this case resolved and the parties are all agreement, then no skin off my back to give you guys what you want.’”

Trump used his executive powers to change the observance of MLK Day by cancelling it as a free-admission day for those who wish to visit our national parks during federal holidays.
The order also applies to Juneteenth. Access to the national parks on those two days will no longer be free as it is with other federal holidays. However, free admission days this year will include June 14, Trump’s birthday, which is also Flag Day and is not a federal holiday.
Obstructing the commemoration or MLK Day is just one more step in mitigating, minimizing or outright undoing the place and role of Black Americans.
Targeting and removing diversity, equity and inclusion programs and initiatives in both the public and private sectors has been a high priority during the second term of the Trump administration.
Trump’s most recent declaration is that the Civil Rights Act hurt white people, resulting in “white people being treated very badly.” What will be next?
Will there be ongoing efforts to bury, erase and recast all of the Black experience — the inhumane and inequitable treatment across generations, as well as the contributions to this country despite it?
Is the desire to bury everything about Black people in a time capsule, never to be found.
As we pause to commemorate the life and work of Martin Luther King Jr., we should take notice of the stark and diabolical efforts to undue everything he worked and paid the ultimate price for: equal treatment, access and opportunities, not only for Blacks but poor whites and all the down-trodden among us.
Clearly, the work is not done.
There are concerted efforts in every aspect of American life to undue the progress made so far and stop the march toward equality.
Martin Luther King Jr. believed in America’s promise — the ideals, principles and laws on which this country was founded and promoted. He mobilized others and appealed to elected officials and policymakers at every level of government to ensure that laws, rights and privileges of the land applied equally to all citizens, irrespective of skin color, gender or station in life.
That was his dream. His life’s work. His ultimate sacrifice.
When remembering King the famous “I Have a Dream” speech, which he delivered during the march on Washington, D.C. in 1963, is often referenced.
But the fire that burned within King’s soul, that led him to dedicate his life toward eradicating social evil and injustice, started long before — nearly 20 years earlier when he traveled to Dublin, Georgia as a senior in high school to deliver “The Negro and the Constitution” in an oratory contest.
Perhaps, King’s dream was just a flicker back then. But as you follow King’s life through college and the seminary, you see that flicker grows into a flame. The more he saw and heard, the more he could not turn a blind eye or a deaf ear. He set out on a life-long journey to eradicate human injustice.
What issues or conditions tug at your heart and soul deeply enough to spend time to change them, make things better for the disenfranchised among us?
It is never too early or too late to do something.
America needs dreamers today like Martin Luther King, Jr. to fix some of its greatest social, racial challenges and inequities.
Many we thought were behind us, only to realize the resurgence of many anew.
While besieged by the current hyperbolic and unpredictable political environment perpetuated by the Trump administration and his state and local cohorts, we could easily lose sight of the ground we have lost in recent years in the quest for equality and equal opportunity — many of the things King fought and died for.
Schools across America are still segregated, some more than ever.
Voting rights continue to be challenged in many states, making it more difficult for Blacks and other minorities to exercise their right to vote.
There is still discrimination occurring in the job market, access to housing, and access to higher education whether it involves admission to colleges, universities of technical vocational institutions.
Discrimination is still rampant in the justice system when it comes to racial profiling, traffic stops, or issuing the same punishments for the same crime. There are injustices even among how schools discipline Black children and white children for the same misconduct.
The pronouncement, executive orders and other actions of the Trump administration have only fueled racial inequity and discord, bringing it front and center in almost every aspect of our daily lives.
Is this your dream for America?
Doing something, continuing to root out inequality and injustice where we encounter it, is the greatest tribute we can pay to Martin Luther King Jr.
When King took up the fight to realize America’s promise for all of her citizens, he knew  change would not come overnight.
What are we willing to do, whether Martin Luther King Jr. Day remains a federal holiday or not?",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/MLK-Day1-BakcyardProduction-e1768747439798-1024x614.jpg,,,2026-01-19 06:57:16.821947

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)Democratic candidates for Michigan secretary of state clashed at a Sunday night forum that included Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist apologizing for past comments on the war in Gaza, as rivals questioned his judgment and focus after he ended his gubernatorial campaign to enter the race.
Gilchrist announced last week that he would be suspending his campaign for governor, saying in a video that “the time for me to serve in that role may come, but now is not that time.”
Former Michigan Lottery Commissioner Suzanna Shkreli took aim at Gilchrist during Wednesday night’s candidate forum, saying the next secretary of state will need to be “laser focused” on elections.
“This office is too important to be treated as a consolation prize or a steppingstone for anybody,” Shkreli said. “I’ve known the lieutenant governor for the past seven years. Having worked with him, we really can’t risk this office landing in the hands of somebody that’s going to use it to elevate their political future. There’s just too much on the line.”
But Gilchrist said he has experience making it easier to access government services, pointing to an automatic criminal record expungement program he championed and an app that allows Detroit residents to report issues to the city from their phone.
“Now more than ever, we need that kind of problem-solving approach as the energy of the secretary of state’s office,” Gilchrist said. “To be efficient, to be responsive and to be a 21st Century office that’s going to protect and strengthen democratic process from the dangers and threats, both rhetorically, legally and physically, of the Trump administration.”SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Deputy Secretary of State Aghogho Edevbie dropped out of the race to be the Democratic nominee for secretary of state after Gilchrist announced his campaign, saying that for the sake of party unity, he was endorsing the lieutenant governor.
That leaves Ingham County Clerk Barb Byrum as the only candidate with experience administering elections, and she was quick to note voters have gone to the polls 42 times since she took office.
“I run tough elections, and I win tough elections,” Byrum said.
Former state Sen. Adam Hollier, a paratrooper who ended his campaign for the U.S. House of Representatives to run for secretary of state, said threats to the election process motivated him to seek the office.
“I jump out of perfectly good airplanes and run into burning buildings as a volunteer firefighter,” Hollier said. “I have always opted into an opportunity to serve where this stuff is happening the most. And as everyone here recognizes, secretary of state is a space where, that’s where the fight is.”
Democrats will use an April 19 endorsement convention in Detroit to rally support around one candidate before officially selecting a nominee in the fall.
Gilchrist apologizes for Gaza comments
Gilchrist started the forum, which was hosted by the Michigan Democratic Party’s Jewish Caucus, by apologizing for saying in the fall that the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was committing a genocide of Palestinian people and that he would not accept campaign contributions from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC, the largest pro-Israel lobbying group in the United States.
“I heard you loud and clear that the nature of some of my comments and campaign rhetoric has been taken as antisemitic. I want to apologize for that,” Gilchrist said.
Gilchrist said he has met with the Anti-Defamation League and the American Jewish Committee.
“I firmly stand against antisemitism, and I vow to continue an open dialogue with this community,” Gilchrist said. “I also believe in my heart that there is a place in the Democratic Party for the entire spectrum of the Jewish people and Jewish community, and I’ll make sure that that door remains wide open to them.”
Michigan has both the largest Arab American community and one of the largest Jewish populations in the country.
Divisions within the Democratic Party over the war in Gaza erupted during the 2024 election, and Gilchrist’s comments last fall were met with raucous applause from the audience members in Dearborn.
Shkreli, without naming Gilchrist, said statewide leaders must consider the impact of their words.
“I think that elected officials need to be very mindful about, you know, what they say,” Shkreli said. “And in times of antisemitism and a rise in what we’ve seen, strong leadership is needed so people feel supported and know that the communities have their back.”

Byrum also stopped short of naming Gilchrist, but said it is important for Democrats to have a ticket that can unite the party.
“I think it’s the responsibility of the secretary of state, and any statewide office holder, to push back against hate, and to continue to be supportive of all constituencies and unite the party,” Byrum said. “You will never have to worry about my words or actions being used as a reason for certain constituencies not to feel loved and welcomed in the Michigan Democratic Party.”
Hollier said “the Black community and the Jewish community have always stood together, because no one else would stand with us.”
“That’s what you should expect from me as your secretary of state,” Hollier said. “You should expect not an ally, not a friend, but somebody who understands that we share in their struggle, that we rise together, that we are fighting this fight together, because we always have been.”
Preparing for election challenges
Byrum said the possibility of attempts to overturn the results of upcoming elections is one reason why the next secretary of state should have experience walking the line between being elected politically but serving in a largely nonpartisan way as an election administrator.
“We need to make sure that we are mitigating any risk,” Byrum said. “One of the ways we can mitigate risk is by having an election official as the Secretary of State.”
She said other candidates, who may not be as familiar with election processes, could be more prone to saying something in error that could have legal consequences down the road.
“Anything a candidate for Secretary of State says today or on the campaign trail can very well show up in pleadings claiming that the elections were rigged,” Byrum said. “If someone misstates an election process, that can be used in court later against them.”
Gilchrist said the Trump administration is leading “the creative destruction of our democracy” and said having “robust” legal teams to challenge the administration in court is “one of the most aggressive and important functions” that the next secretary of state will need to prioritize.
Shkreli said the state must “have a posture of legal preparedness,” including building a “litigation playbook.”

“We’ve got to work with relevant stakeholders, such as the attorney general and the Bureau of Elections, to ensure that we have the best litigation strategy possible to fight any unconstitutional attacks on our electoral process,” Shkreli said.
Hollier said reducing ambiguity in election law could help eliminate some challenges.
“There are too many spaces for people to fight over the details that are not being adequately enforced, and, most importantly, too many spaces for people to make mistakes,” Hollier said.
Gilchrist said state and local leaders are already running tabletop exercises to predict possible lines of attack ahead of the 2026 midterms.
“That preparation work is already underway for this election, and we’re going to have to start it almost immediately after this election in preparation for the elections that are going to happen in 2027 and 2028 across Michigan,” Gilchrist said.
Digital IDs, data privacy and other priorities
Overseeing elections is only half of the secretary of state’s job, with branch offices throughout the state handling things like vehicle registrations and state IDs also falling under their purview.
Hollier said the process of going to a Secretary of State office, only to find out you brought the wrong paperwork to prove your identity, can be frustrating.
That’s why he said the Department of State should be able to collaborate with other departments, like the Department of Health and Human Services, to retrieve the documents they need.
“State employees want to be able to say yes and be as helpful as they possibly can, and too often, our systems do not allow them to do so,” Hollier said.

The proposal highlights the amount of personal data the state has about each resident.
Gilchrist said he would make it a priority to protect the privacy of that personal data “from big tech companies that are hungry to mine it and the Trump administration that is thirsty to surveil it.”
“The Trump administration has been suing state after state after state to try to get access to that information so they could use it to attack people, to weaponize it against communities, against minorities, to make them less safe, to feed it to ICE so they can go in with Gestapo tactics and threaten and kill people, as we’ve seen in other parts of this country,” Gilchrist said.
“I’m deeply concerned about that, but I’m also concerned about what the tech companies want to do with this information, to feed it into an AI model without your permission, to run it through a data center that we don’t want to see here in the state of Michigan,” Gilchrist continued.
Hollier said the Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations being carried out in states like Minnesota highlight the need for every resident to have access to a state ID.
“Especially at a time within a country where people can ask you for your papers, we have to make sure that every single Michigander has a valid ID,” Hollier said.
He said formerly incarcerated individuals can face challenges in obtaining a state ID with just their prison documents, but a pilot program with the Department of Corrections that he advocated for makes the process easier.
Shkreli said she wants to make it possible for Michigan drivers to add their licenses to digital wallets on iOS and Android devices.
Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson said when Apple announced the feature in 2021 that she wanted Michigan to be among the first states to enroll. So far, 20 states and Puerto Rico have some form of digital ID available. Michigan legislators introduced a bill in 2023 to allow digital state IDs, but it stalled in the Legislature.
Byrum said kiosks allowing some business to be conducted without ever stepping foot in a branch office should be expanded, noting that some areas of the state do not have Kroger or Meijer locations nearby, making it just as inconvenient to find a kiosk as it would be to go to the branch office.
Gilchrist said the secretary of state’s customer service role makes the branch offices throughout the state “the front door to people’s interactions with state government.”
“Too many times when people are interacting with state government, they’re doing so at a time when they need something, and they need it fast. It gets frustrating when it doesn’t happen, or it’s not easy, or it’s cumbersome,” Gilchrist said. “It’s imperative that we make sure that is not the experience people have. Because people who lose trust in government processes are ones who lose faith in democracy, and ones who check out from democratic processes and, ultimately, may end up less likely to vote.”

(Getty Images)I’ve been watching with considerable interest as hundreds of Broken Arrow residents fight against a plan that would rezone a parcel of agricultural land to make way for a proposed mosque and retail development in their community.
It’s not the project itself that’s captured my interest. It’s the fact that this is the second such high profile fight pitting developers against residents in just a few months.
Late last year, Edmond residents were fighting against a developer who wanted to build a Walmart on a piece of undeveloped land in the north part of the city. The Walmart developer plans to erect a neighborhood market on a busy two-lane road that already suffers from traffic congestion and flooding. The store would sit alarmingly close to an existing housing development and is not far from a major natural gas junction.
It was during that Edmond fight that I learned about Senate Bill 647, which would weaken a city’s ability to deny developments, neuter the input of residents and voters and empower developers to get their way regardless of whether their project is welcome or a good fit.
The Republican-led measure was one of those bills that flew under the radar during the 2025 session, but alarmingly cleared both legislative chambers. It would have made it to Gov. Kevin Stitt’s desk but for the fact that, thankfully, the House and the Senate could not agree on the final language.
Insultingly, the measure contains a clause that “decisions on land use application shall not be based solely upon the presence, numbers or magnitude of opposition or protests in the absence of objective and relevant facts.”
It seeks to deem municipal zoning decisions as a done deal unless the challenging party proves the ordinance lacks a substantial relation to public health, safety or general welfare or if a zoning decision “constitutes an unreasonable, arbitrary exercise of police power.”
And it would require planning commissions and governing boards to approve plats as long as they’re in compliance with a city’s subdivision regulations. Compliance with a city’s comprehensive development plan would not be required for approval under the measure.
Had this been law, the concerns of residents in both cities and of those elsewhere across the state fighting developers probably wouldn’t have mattered. The developers probably would have won the day.
Residents at the Broken Arrow City Council meeting last week expressed reasonable concerns about increased traffic congestion, and the impact of the development on storm water runoff and septic tanks if a 42,000-square-foot Islamic center and a 20,000-square-foot retail space and a parking lot were built.
The Tulsa World reported that last month much of the opposition initially “was voiced in anti-Islamic terms,” but in recent days those who opposed the development and city leaders have shifted the conversation to more practical issues.
Edmond residents, meanwhile, who live in the area told their planning and zoning commission and city council that even though the area is technically zoned commercial, they didn’t believe the acreage and infrastructure at the corner of Coltrane and Covell can support a 43,000-square-foot development on 9.7 acres.
And as someone who drives through that congested Edmond intersection, who has sat in 40-car traffic jams at the traffic light, and who has witnessed a semi-truck get stuck trying to make a turn onto a two-lane road, they’re probably right.
The problem is under the proposed law they’d have to prove that objectively. Their lived experiences wouldn’t count. And how does a resident objectively prove traffic congestion without a traffic counter or cooperation from a city?
And how can someone objectively prove that storm water won’t drain in an undeveloped flood plane without a parking lot there?
The city councils in both cities ultimately rejected the developers’ plans. In Edmond, Walmart’s developer is appealing. The Islamic Society of Tulsa, which is backing the mosque, is also expected to appeal.
Watching both fights play out, I’ve learned there is a lot of gray area when it comes to planning, zoning and platting. There is subjectivity to approving plats and developers’ plans. Local residents don’t pay attention to platting and zoning until the time comes to develop property.
Other times, designations no longer fit the land as communities evolve or grow or our environment or weather patterns change. Bureaucracy can be slow, and it takes time for things to catch up. And just because land is zoned or platted a certain way doesn’t mean every sort of business or development belongs there.
Until last session, lawmakers have been smart enough to realize that, and they’ve given municipalities broader discretion to act in the best interests of their residents and communities. 
To even consider passing a law that indicates city leaders are making decisions solely on the size of crowds or opposition is insulting not only to those officials, but also the voters who elect them. It also indicates that our legislators don’t understand how this works.
And it’s astounding that lawmakers are seemingly trying to strip their constituents’ rights at the expense of developers, who do have a lot of lobbying power at our Capitol.
Last I checked Republicans were supposed to champion local control and believed that residents generally know what’s best for their local communities.
I don’t know if we’ll see this bill — or a similar iteration — rise from the dead when lawmakers reconvene in February. But heaven help us all if we do. 
Because it will signal the death knell to citizen input in proposed developments impacting our families and the rise in power of developers. And it will harm everyone’s ability to work together to make their communities better.

Now a bipartisan group of Nebraska state senators wants to write into law that new members of the officially nonpartisan Legislature take a 20-question civics test — and publicly post the scores.
A passing grade would not be required, and individual answers would remain confidential. But the “raw scores” would be listed on the Legislature’s official website and also on the lawmaker’s official public biography.
Results would not affect the ability of any lawmaker to hold or continue to serve in a public role, according to Legislative Bill 1066, which should not “be construed to add to or alter the qualifications for office established in the Constitution of Nebraska.”

The introducer of LB 1066, State Sen. John Fredrickson of Omaha, said the effort was inspired by conservative and progressive constituents alike who have questioned the level of understanding and appreciation lawmakers have of U.S. government and responsibility to steward institutions that protect them.
With the country’s 250th birthday approaching, Fredrickson thought it was a good time for the civics test law. The measure is co-sponsored by lawmakers from diverse political backgrounds: State Sens. Stan Clouse of Kearney, Tanya Storer of Whitman and Paul Strommen of Sidney are Republicans; State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha is a progressive independent. Fredrickson is a Democrat.
“We have a very serious job,” Fredrickson said of all 49 state senators. “We create, we amend, and we repeal laws. So ensuring that folks who are in that position are continually educating themselves on our responsibility to uphold the Constitution … felt like an important step to take.”
Fredrickson said he has at times heard colleagues say things like, “Well the governor is the boss.” He recalled a couple of recent situations when the Legislature voted to approve a bill then, following the governor’s veto, certain senators flipped their votes and buried the proposal.

One such occasion came last year when, despite three consecutive bipartisan votes to lift a lifetime ban on public food aid for some Nebraskans with past drug felonies, the Legislature did an about face. The only change was Gov. Jim Pillen’s veto.
That prompted Fredrickson’s debate remark: “We were elected to lead, not to follow, and certainly not to flinch.”
He reminded colleagues that the Legislature is a separate and coequal branch of government to the executive and judicial arms. Such occasions gave rise to his thought: “How do we refresh our memories of the basic principles of how our country works and how our role as legislators should be exercised.”
Storer said she was encouraged to back a bill she believes should get universal support.
She said that while lawmakers come to the Legislature with different experiences, political backgrounds and home districts that represent rural, urban and suburban neighborhoods, a common ground should be a foundational grasp and appreciation of civics and the country’s road to democracy.
State Sen. Tanya Storer of Whitman. April 10, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
“It’s not a partisan issue. It’s an American issue,” she said. “We don’t know where we’re going if we don’t know where we’ve come from, right?”
Admittedly, not everybody loves test-taking, Storer said. She chuckled and said her palms even got a bit sweaty thinking about the process, though not to the point of doubting its value. She said public posting of raw scores might be a deterrent for some, but underscored that a failed grade won’t get anyone removed from office.
“If anything, it would prompt us all to be more intentional about studying civics and basic principles of government,” Storer said.
Fredrickson said he is unaware of any past efforts to require a civics test of Nebraska lawmakers, and believes the law would be a first for a state. A public hearing will be scheduled for LB 1066. 
Exam questions could be pulled from the civics portion of the test administered to naturalization candidates by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security or an equivalent designed by the Nebraska Secretary of State or Nebraska Department of Education.
The Clerk of the Legislature would provide the test, within 90 days of a state senator taking office, that would include 20 randomly selected questions about U.S. history and civics. A lawmaker who doesn’t reach a passing score would be invited, not required, to attend a voluntary civic literacy seminar conducted by the Nebraska State Historical Society or Legislative Research Office.

For Nebraska students, answering questions from the civics portion of the federal citizenship and naturalization test is one of three options Nebraska school boards have to fulfill the state legal requirement aimed at ensuring students are prepared “to be competent and responsible citizens who engage in public debate knowledgeably and in a civil manner.” Other suggested options for students include a project on an important American figure or attendance at a public meeting. 



 How’s your grasp of civics?

Test your own civics knowledge with some questions from the U.S. citizenship and naturalization test. During that exam, a federal officer asks an applicant up to 10 questions from a list of 100. Six correct answers are needed to pass.

What is the economic system in the U.S.?
To whom does the Constitution grant the power to declare war?

Martin Luther King Jr. delivers a speech to a crowd of approximately 7,000 people on May 17, 1967, at UC Berkeley’s Sproul Plaza in Berkeley, California. (Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images)Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s words from his “Beyond Vietnam” speech still ring true.
“When machines and computers, profit motives, and property rights are considered more important than people,” he warned, “the giant triplets of racism, extreme materialism, and militarism are incapable of being conquered.”
Those words, delivered in 1967, still summarize today’s political moment. Instead of putting the lives of workingAmericans first, our leaders in Congress and the WhiteHouse have prioritized advancing corporate profits and wealth concentration, slashing government programs meant to advance upward mobility, and deploying military forces across the country, increasing distrust and tension.
This historic regression corresponds with a recessionary environment for Black America in particular. That’s what my organization, the Joint Center, found in our report, “State of the Dream 2026: From Regression to Signs of a Black Recession.”
The economic landscape for Black Americans in 2026 is troubling, with unemployment rates signaling a potential recession. By December 2025, Black unemployment had reached 7.5 percent — a stark contrast to the national rate of 4.4 percent. This disparity highlights the persistent economic inequalities faced by Black communities, which have only been exacerbated by policy shifts that have weakened the labor market. The volatility in Black youth unemployment, which fluctuated dramatically in the latter months of 2025, underscores the precariousness of the situation.
The Trump administration’s executive orders have systematically dismantled structures aimed at promoting racial equality. By targeting programs such as Lyndon Johnson’s 1965 Equal Employment Opportunity executive order and defunding agencies like the Minority Business
Development Agency, the administration has shifted federal support away from disadvantaged businesses. As a result, Black-owned firms risk losing contracts and resources tied to federal programs, potentially resulting in job losses and reduced economic growth. These changes threaten billions in federal revenue for Black-owned firms and undermine efforts to move beyond racial inequality in the workforce.
The GOP’s so-called “Big Beautiful Bill,” passed in 2025, further entrenches inequality by providing tax cuts that disproportionately benefit high-income households and corporations — while simultaneously slashing investments in programs like Medicaid and SNAP, limiting access to essential services for low-income households. The technology sector, a critical component of the American economy, is also affected by this disregard for civil rights. Executive orders like “Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence” have stripped away protections that could advance inclusion in this rapidly growing field. As a result, the future of the American economy risks reinforcing past inequalities.
Dr. King’s call for strong, aggressive federal leadership in addressing racial inequality remains highly relevant. However, instead of eradicating structures of inequality, our current leadership is implementing policies that destroy government jobs and dismantle agencies responsible for preventing predatory economic practices. These choices undermine longstanding efforts to combat racial and economic disparities — and exemplify the regressive economic policies that coincide with rising Black unemployment.
As Dr. King stated, “we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt.” But urgent action is required. Unless we act deliberately, economic and racial inequalities will become entrenched, resulting in generational loss. The core question is whether we will move beyond our nation’s history of racism, materialism, and militarism, and — as Dr. King urged — embrace “the fierce urgency now” to advance equity.

Phil Murphy signed the family leave expansion bill just days before he leaves office after two terms as governor. (Photo by Anne-Marie Caruso/New Jersey Monitor)Gov. Phil Murphy signed a bill over the weekend that will expand family leave benefits to workers at smaller companies, just days before he leaves office after two terms.
Murphy, a Democrat, called the legislation “historic.” It allows workers at firms with as few as 15 employees to take job-protected paid family leave, down from 30 workers in the state’s prior family leave law.
“By amending the eligibility requirements for job-protected leave, we are ensuring newer employees and employees of small businesses are not excluded from the protections of the New Jersey Family Leave Act. Now, employees will not have to work as long before being able to utilize their leave with the assurance that they can return to their job once the leave concludes,” he said.
Murphy leaves office at noon on Tuesday when his successor, Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill (D), becomes governor.
As new legislative session begins, some major bills go back to starting line

Existing New Jersey law permits workers to take up to 12 weeks of paid family leave to bond with new children or care for a sick or injured loved one. Workers on family leave can earn up to 85% of their weekly pay, to a cap of $1,119 in 2026.
To be eligible under current law, an employee must have worked at a given employer for at least 12 months and have worked at least 1,000 hours in the preceding 12 months. The bill Murphy signed cuts those qualifications in half, requiring workers to be with their employer for at least six months and slashing the hours requirement to 500.
Bill sponsor Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin (D-Middlesex) called the legislation “good for the workforce, good for babies and families, and good for our state as a whole.”
“By reducing the amount of time someone has to be on the job before becoming eligible for family leave, this legislation recognizes the realities of today’s workforce and makes sure more parents can care for and bond with their newborn without fearing they’ll lose their job. No one should be penalized for needing time to care, and this bill helps make sure the vast majority of workers never will,” he said.
Existing law bars employers from retaliating against workers for using family leave benefits. The legislation Murphy signed says workers are entitled to be restored to their previous position or one with equivalent pay, benefits, and seniority upon returning from family leave. It also explicitly allows workers to use family leave, temporary disability benefits, and earned sick leave in the order of their choosing.
Business groups had opposed the bill, warning that expanding family leave eligibility could make New Jersey small businesses less competitive.

Idaho’s $14 million in federal funds — approved by the Legislature in 2025 as an addition to the Idaho Child Care Program — hadn’t even been spent yet, because the state didn’t dole out the money to providers, Charron wrote in a Jan. 12 letter. But she told the lawmakers that the agency “shares your unwavering commitment to rooting out any potential fraud, waste, and abuse in all public programs (that the agency) administers.”
Idaho’s efforts come weeks after a conservative social media influencer made viral fraud allegations about Minnesota’s child care programs. The video’s claims — which spurred the Trump administration to crack down on child care funding — were largely misleading, according to a fact check by national news outlet The 19th. 
Fraud hasn’t recently been alleged in Idaho’s program, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Welfare said. And Idaho’s governor defended the state’s track record of running public assistance programs.

 After Idaho didn’t promise to pause spending, Idaho lawmaker mulls next steps

Idaho lawmakers ask state to freeze child care grants program

But the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare director’s letter didn’t explicitly say if the state would do what the lawmakers asked: Freeze the new child care expansion funds until more safeguards are in place. It also came two days after a deadline the lawmakers had requested.
Tanner, one of the lawmakers who asked for Idaho’s pause and who is the new co-chair of the Legislature’s powerful budget committee, said he didn’t feel like the agency fully addressed his concerns, and he’s mulling what comes next.
“We just want to make sure that any funds going out … that we are making sure that we have things in place to prevent fraud, as much as we possibly can,” he told the Sun in an interview Thursday. “We don’t want to be a Minnesota. We do not want to be any other state. We want to make sure that  we learn from other people’s mistakes, and make sure that we have things in place that prevent that.”
Asked if the Department of Health and Welfare would comply with the lawmakers request, agency spokesperson AJ McWhorter said in a statement Wednesday that the agency is “working with the Governor’s office to determine the next steps.”
 Governor says Idaho has strong track record of running public assistance programs

Early this month Gov. Brad Little called what’s happening in Minnesota “abominable.” But asked about concerns about Idaho’s program to-be, Little touted Idaho’s management of public assistance programs.
“I’m always concerned about fraud. I mean, but if you look at our programs, you look at SNAP, you look at Medicaid, you look at all the programs … Idaho’s compliance rates are one of the highest,” Little told reporters on Jan. 8.

Last week, McWhorter told the Sun there had not been complaints about fraud, waste or abuse in Idaho’s program to expand child care availability. But he said in the coming months, the agency is planning unannounced visits to child care facilities and other investigative actions. 
Tanner said he isn’t sure if there is fraud in Idaho’s program.
“I really don’t know,” he said. “I mean, I’ve not seen blatant fraud, but I think there’s always question(s), because there is a system — there was a gaming system that was going on — that was not necessarily being looked at from, I would say, pretty much most states, and I think that’s that’s something to go back and revisit and relook at.”
 What grant oversight work is the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare planning?

In her letter to Tanner and Lenney, Charron pledged to shore up more safeguards — including to review all past providers in the program within the next two months to ensure that additional funding does “meet our rigorous standards of compliance.”
 
But in more than 1,000 random audits of a quarter of the state’s providers, only 45 resulted in providers being removed from the program, or having their licenses suspended or revoked, Charron wrote.
“Safeguarding taxpayer dollars that support working families and vulnerable children is critical and an issue of public confidence we do not take lightly,” Charron said in a written statement included in a news release last week. “Every effort devoted to proactive prevention and detection efforts saves in recovery costs, ensures program integrity, and preserves vital services for those who truly need them. Any bad actors will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”

Prosecutor pushes back on defense assertion that state law allows the capture, hunting and destruction of predatory animals in ""any manner whatsoever.""
The post Wolf torment defendant Cody Roberts wants animal cruelty case tossed appeared first on WyoFile .","Cody Roberts has doubled down on his push to have his felony animal cruelty case dismissed.
Robert Piper, Roberts’ attorney, on Tuesday filed a second motion arguing that Roberts’ case should be tossed. Sublette County Prosecutor Clayton Melinkovich’s case rests on ignoring the plain language of a state law allowing wildlife to be hunted, captured, killed or destroyed “in any manner not otherwise prohibited by law,” he said.
The case relies on an “unconstitutionally broad reading” of the law, Piper said.
In February 2024, Roberts captured a wolf and brought it into the Green River Bar in Daniel on a leash and with its mouth duct-taped. The incident ignited global outrage. In the aftermath, the Wyoming Game and Fish Department cited Roberts for illegally possessing the wolf, and issued him a $250 fine, but declined to pursue further charges. In August, Melinkovich convened a grand jury, which indicted Roberts for felony animal cruelty.
Roberts has pleaded not guilty.
Piper’s motion filed this week was the third in a back-and-forth between Piper and Melinkovich over the legitimacy of the case. Piper filed a motion to dismiss in mid-December, arguing that state statute creates a “blanket license” to capture, hunt and destroy predatory animals in “any manner whatsoever.”
Melinkovich responded in late December, writing that the statute in question is only relevant to how animals can be captured and killed. The case, however, is not about how the animal was captured or killed, but what happened to it in between, Melinkovich said.
In the warring motions, the attorneys have argued over the Wyoming Legislature’s intentions in drafting the statute.
Melinkovich argued that lawmakers obviously didn’t intend to permit wildlife to be treated in any way. That would permit torture and bestiality, which is “absurd” and not the intention, Melinkovich said.
In the most recent filing, Piper said the Legislature’s decision to pass a law last year prohibiting people from causing living wildlife, including predators, “undue suffering” demonstrates that was not the intent of the earlier statute.
A pretrial hearing to consider the motions is set for Jan. 28. The trial is set to begin on March 9.
Melinkovich also filed a rebuttal of his own this week, in response to filings by Piper seeking to exclude some evidence.
Piper asked Sweetwater County District Court Judge Richard Lavery to prohibit including as evidence of prior acts of wrongdoing, hearsay and expert testimony from Ken Mills, a Game and Fish large carnivore biologist. Piper said Mills would unscientifically analyze a video of the wolf and tell the jury what to think about it.
Melinkovich responded that he intended to follow the rules of the court vis-a-vis hearsay and prior acts of wrongdoing.
The state does not intend to “engage in prosecutorial misconduct,” Melinkovich said.
Mills’ testimony would use his specialized knowledge of wolves to help the jury make a determination about whether Roberts “maliciously allowed the undue suffering” of the wolf to continue, Melinkovich said. Mills will help determine whether the animal was suffering, Melinkovich said.

Legislators took a first crack at a measure that will establish major components of Wyoming’s $205M plans. Representatives of facilities like Riverton's new hospital are encouraged by proposed funding opportunities. 
The post Rural health care dollars buoy Wyoming hospitals, providers as lawmakers get on board appeared first on WyoFile .","RIVERTON—Clad in a hard hat and neon safety vest, Corte McGuffey walked across floors coated in drywall dust, pointing out what’s to come in this unfinished building. A radiology lab here, clinical exam rooms over there, a walk-up pharmacy near the back and on the second floor, hospital beds and two labor and delivery bays. 
McGuffey was leading a tour of Riverton’s new hospital, which is the result of a seven-year effort to fundraise, design, build and staff a community-owned health facility in this western Wyoming town of roughly 11,000. 
Construction broke ground in late 2024. Over the past year, a 70,000-square-foot building has risen on a plot of land on the north edge of town. Crews recently installed exterior walls and most of the windows. The hope is to finish construction by September, and begin accepting patients before year’s end. 
The hospital spawned from local displeasure with consolidation and loss of services under SageWest, which operates its own hospital in Riverton. It represents a rare area of growth in Wyoming’s health care landscape, which has experienced widening service gaps in recent years as hospitals and clinics struggle to retain workers and maintain financial stability. 
The Riverton Medical District Board still needs to complete construction, hire staff and implement billing and record systems — and would like to raise additional money. Once open, the facility will face financial realities that make hospital viability so challenging in Wyoming. Things like low volume and high fixed costs.
Overcoming those challenges may become more feasible for Riverton’s and other health care facilities now that Wyoming will receive $205 million in federal Rural Health Transformation Funds in 2026 — and up to $800 million beyond that over the consecutive five years.

As part of its plans to deploy the funds, Wyoming proposes to spend a big chunk on supporting hospitals. The Riverton Medical District Board pooled its own rural health recommendations with fellow Billings Clinic affiliates in Wyoming and submitted them to the state, and has been closely following the process. Though there are few details at this early stage about fund deployment, Riverton hospital officials see promise not only for their facility to benefit, but also the broader state health care network. 
“Wyoming has a real opportunity to use these funds, and hopefully not just a one-time shot, hopefully to create a way to use the money for a long period of time,” McGuffey, who chairs the Riverton Medical District board, said amid the din of construction. 
Rapidly unfolding 
The Rural Health Transformation Program is a new federal initiative created by President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The program will funnel $50 billion to states over five years to stabilize and strengthen rural hospitals and providers. 
The application and award process unfolded rapidly this fall. Wyoming Department of Health staff gathered input through stakeholder conferences and public meetings starting in September. The state received 1,300 responses to an online survey. Staff prepared an 84-page application and submitted it in early November.
The application proposed an array of initiatives to bolster health care. Those include incentives for small rural hospitals to provide basic services and cut extraneous ones that can be performed at regional facilities; grants for clinical workforce training programs and five-year commitments from grads; a state-run insurance plan for catastrophic events; and permanent, investment-generated revenue to boost the industry. There were also programs designed to promote healthy habits, expand technology like telehealth and bolster EMS services.
Wyoming applied for an initial budget of $200 million. When awards were announced Dec. 29, the state was given $5 million more than it requested and received the second-largest award per capita, behind Alaska. 
Now, the work begins. It will entail drafting contracts, hiring staff, crafting bills and gaining legislative approval. The vision is that initiatives will be available to an array of health care services, providers and programs. 
Staying inside the lines
On Thursday, the Joint Appropriations Committee considered a draft bill to establish the perpetuity investment fund, create an advisory panel and launch programs for implementing many of the state’s Rural Health proposals. 
Though many of Wyoming’s state lawmakers are small-government conservatives wary of growing agencies, appropriations members appeared to support the bill — a necessary step in receiving the Trump administration funds. 
One notable initiative not in the bill is the state-run insurance plan, which appropriations committee members previously frowned upon. 
Wyoming does anticipate some amount of flexibility to opt out of the application’s approved initiatives, Wyoming Health Department Director Stefan Johansson told the board. However, “adding programming to this effort is likely not allowable at the federal level.”
Anything outside of the approved purposes in the application risks clawback from the federal government, according to the Wyoming Department of Health. 
“I don’t want it to be a situation where we color outside the lines, to the point where we find ourselves without lines and maybe without a fund,” said Rep. Jeremy Haroldson, R-Wheatland.

The bill will play a key role in the rollout of the rural health fund proposals.
“This is, in my view, a generational opportunity to make some very smart, conservative, but practical investments in our rural and frontier communities when it comes to their health and their health care,” Johansson said. “I think this is a very good opportunity for us to take full advantage of the Trump administration’s program in this area.”
The committee did not vote on the draft, which it tabled until February. 
Obstacles 
Back in Riverton, McGuffey reflected on nearly eight years of efforts, like feasibility studies and fundraising, to get to the current hospital construction phase.  
“The amount of work that goes into pulling something like this off is … crazy,” he said. 
That included securing a $37.1 million USDA Rural Development loan, $15 million in federal grant funding facilitated by the state and the 4-acre building site. The district is partnering with the Billings Clinic to be an affiliate of the larger health care company, which it hopes will help leverage resources.
“We worked for so long just looking at a lot,” McGuffey said from a second-floor balcony in the new building. “To see [the building] actually go up is really exciting.”
The hospital will provide more than 100 local jobs and present the kind of essential health care that draws families to communities, Riverton Medical District Board members say. That will include, eventually, limited labor and delivery — a service that SageWest Riverton and several other state hospitals have closed down in recent years.

Once the doors open, the facility will have to navigate the unique challenges of operating a hospital in the largely frontier state. 
The infusion of federal funds and Wyoming’s plan will help overcome those challenges, Gov. Mark Gordon said during a press conference last week. 
“The bottom line is, this program will protect hospitals, strengthen emergency care, grow our rural health care workforce and bring care closer to home,” Gordon said. 
The governor also acknowledged the Legislature’s role in securing the federal funds. 
“I think we have the opportunity here with the Legislature to be able to really move forward in a way that’s going to help their constituents,” Gordon said. “I think all of Wyoming is looking very carefully at what this plan means.”

Wisdom from a dying woman inspired guest columnist John Freeman to rethink patriotism in the new year. 
The post Healing the political virus infecting our state and local communities appeared first on WyoFile .","Death is clarifying, not just for the dying, but for the living. As a hospice volunteer, I have the privilege of spending time with dying patients. Recently, I asked a patient, ‘Mabel,’ for her thoughts on how we might overcome the nastiness, anger and cruelty that has infected our beloved state and local communities.    

Opinion

Mabel began by telling me about her late husband, a World War II veteran. Missing today, she suggested, is the kind of patriotism rooted in America’s core value of liberty and justice for all, and that all are created equal. These were shared values that made the American experiment so exceptional, the American people so optimistic and the United States the envy of the world.   
After the war, thanks to the GI Bill, Mabel’s husband and millions of other veterans were able to pursue and pay for ongoing education, get help obtaining jobs, purchase starter homes, and invest in stocks, bonds and other assets. Because the U.S. was still segregated when the GI Bill became law, many Black veterans were excluded. For the veterans who did access the benefits, this led to historic prosperity — today’s baby boomers are the wealthiest generation in history.  
But we of the postwar era have taken for granted what the veterans of a prior generation bequeathed to us. Over the past 80 years, liberty and justice for all has morphed into liberty and justice for a few. 
Mabel minced no words. We who proudly called ourselves liberals — teachers in schools and colleges, policy experts in think-tanks and government — have failed to recognize that the concentration of wealth in the hands of the few is incompatible with liberty and justice for all. 
How right she is. The possibility of America isn’t just a political framework; it’s rooted in ideals that our nation’s founders, most wealthy landowners and slaveholders themselves, bravely enshrined despite the reality of their time. It isn’t surprising that, without exception, the founders were men of faith, trusting in each other and in something far greater than themselves. Whether religious or not, they held a shared belief in the dignity and goodness of humankind “created in God’s image.”  
But our better angels retreat amidst fear, insecurity and isolation, and that is where we are today. In a world of rapid change, misinformation and rampant loneliness, we are forgetting the moral underpinning of who we are and the very goodness that makes us human. 
Wyoming has yet to build immunity to this virus. From her hospital bed, Mabel remains a keen observer of current events. She acknowledges that with our low population, the ease of getting elected and our pathological dislike of government, Wyoming is an ideal place for agents of the wealthy and powerful to influence more than state and local government, but national politics as well. We are willing pawns in the scheme.
And so the infection spreads. Fear mongers capitalize on the legitimate grievances of hardworking, values-driven Wyomingites to advance their own agendas, leaving those furthest from opportunity even further behind.  
Sounds too simple, but it is not. It all might cast a dark shadow on the start of 2026, were it not for Mabel’s additional wisdom: The remedy is one another. The virus spreads in the distance between us, in the unkindness, distrust and nastiness that advance the interests of the powerful few. Likewise, we each have power to prioritize our neighbors over news headlines, to make patriotism about liberty and justice for all, to find ourselves in service of others and the urgent needs of our nation. In sum, we can commit this year to being human in all our goodness. We can build better communities and a better state by taking to heart the wisdom of a dying woman.

(Photo by Kevin Hardy/Stateline)LINCOLN — A new bill would require Nebraska’s K-12 schools to teach lessons about the ills of communism. 
Legislative Bill 1024 from State Sen. Dave Murman of Glenville would require each Nebraska school district, starting next school year, to make time to teach the history of communism — worldwide and in the U.S. 
The proposed curriculum would range from covering what the bill describes as “the increasing threat of communism in the United States and its allies through the 20th century” to “mass killings that have occurred under communist regimes.” 
Similar state laws have passed in Florida and Texas. Florida Republican U.S. Rep. María Elvira Salazar has a federal bill that passed the U.S. House that would require the creation of a civics education program to teach high schoolers nationwide about “the dangers of communism.” 
“There’s a lot of students, especially in college, and kids that are out of the K-12 school system, who seem to support socialism and even communism nowadays,” Murman said. “I think we just have to be diligent that the risks and dangers, bad things that happen under communism, are taught in our schools.”

Murman, who chairs the Legislature’s Education Committee, said he hasn’t decided whether the bill will be a priority for the committee during the short session. The bill was cosponsored by five of his fellow Republicans in the officially nonpartisan Nebraska Legislature: State Sen. Beau Ballard of Lincoln, State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood, Loren Lippincott of Central City, ​​State Sen. Dan Lonowski of Hastings and State Sen. Tanya Storer of Whitman.

The proposal also would require students to take a written test “identical to the entire civics portion” of the U.S. citizenship test before completing eighth grade and before graduating from high school.
Tim Royers, president of the Nebraska State Education Association, the biggest teachers union in the state, said the union is “obviously opposed.” He noted that the subject was already required to be covered.
“These aren’t good standards,” Royers told the Examiner. “This isn’t the right way to teach history.” 
Royers also said the way the proposal is written steps on the toes of local boards of education. He said Murman should “let teachers write the social studies standards.”
Murman said lawmakers have the authority to offer guidance on education, and he wanted legal assurance that it would be taught.

Gov. Brad Little in his budget proposal called for $22 million in cuts to Medicaid, offering options for service cuts, such as dental coverage and home-and-community-based care for people with disabilities, the Idaho Capital Sun reported. Little also included in his budget about $23 million in reductions to Medicaid through an extension of the 4% doctor reimbursement cuts first approved in August in response to the projected state budget shortfall. 
JFAC Co-Chair Josh Tanner, R-Eagle, said that the budget committee will hear from the chairs of the House and Senate Health and Welfare committees, which hold public hearings on bills. Budget bills are not brought through those committees. 
Rep. Elaine Price, R-Coeur d’Alene, recommended “reaching out to your constituents, reading those emails. Responding to those emails will get you that picture as well.”
“That’s part of our job as a Legislature, we’re supposed to be representing our constituents,” Price said, “and if we’re not reaching out to them and reading their emails, then we’re not getting that information.” 
A budget hearing in JFAC for the Division of Medicaid is scheduled for Jan. 22, and the budget will be set later in the session.

The grizzly bear, which is listed as a threatened species under the federal Endangered Species Act, was shot in late October north of Perkins Lake in Boundary County, near the Idaho-Montana border, state and federal officials said. 
On Jan. 13, officials with the Center for Biological Diversity announced they are increasing the financial reward they are offering to $7,300, which brings the total reward up to $15,000. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Idaho’s Citizens Against Poaching previously announced they are offering rewards for information that leads to the arrest and conviction for the illegal killing. 
U.S. Fish and Wildlife staff received a mortality signal from the electronic collar the grizzly bear was wearing on Oct. 28. Following an investigation with the Idaho Department of Fish and Game, officials determined that the bear was not a threat to the shooter, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said in a press release issued Dec. 10.
In a separate press release issued Jan. 13, officials with the Center for Biological Diversity said the female grizzly that was killed was from the Cabinet-Yaak Ecosystem, which they described as the most imperiled grizzly bear population in the continental United States.
The conservation organization said that the death of even one or two female grizzly bears could be devastating for a recovering bear population. 
“This was a tragic, completely preventable loss and the consequences to grizzly recovery are enormous,” Kristine Akland, Northern Rockies director at the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a written statement. “In a population this small and fragile, every female is critical to survival. Losing even one can tip the balance toward the decline of the entire population. We’re increasing the reward because the person responsible for killing this bear needs to be held accountable.”

Martin Luther King, Jr., on April 4, 2018. (Photo: Nashville.gov)Across the country, streets named for Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. don’t need explaining in Black communities. 
They are known by feel. Among long corridors where beauty supply stores sit beside corner stores, where barbershops outlast boarded-up buildings, where potholes crowd the pavement and front-porch conversations stretch past sundown. These are not symbolic roads. They are places where Black life continues, day after day, despite decades of disinvestment, living in the shadow of a name that promised justice long before cities were ready to deliver it.
In Tennessee, King’s legacy is etched into the geography of the state itself. His name appears on green street signs and stretches of asphalt that carry daily life: commuters heading to work, children walking to school, and churches opening their doors on Sunday mornings.
But those streets did not come easily.
The fight to name roads after King in the Volunteer state unfolded over decades, shaped by local politics, racial resistance and a persistent question about where, and how, Black history is allowed to exist in public space: Is naming a street after King an act of honor, or a substitute for the economic and political investment his work demanded?
There are now more than 1,000 streets named for King; globally, including at least 955 in the United States, according to University of Tennessee geographer Derek Alderman, whose extensive research over the last two decades has examined the geography of King streets nationwide. Those streets span 41 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, many emerging after King’s assassination in 1968 and again following the establishment of the federal holiday in 1983.
More than 1,000 streets across the world are named for Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., says Derek Alderman, Ph.D., professor of geography at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. (Photo: University of Tennessee)
Tennessee has at least 17 streets bearing King’s name, stretching across the state’s largest cities and extending into smaller rural communities, such as Bolivar, New Market and Rockwood, sometimes no more than narrow back roads, absent from Google Maps and quietly maintained by residents determined to ensure King’s name remains visible.
“There’s been a fairly typical pattern across the United States,” Alderman said. “None of this happens without Black activism. Black communities, Black clergy, and those who have pushed very hard to get King’s name on a prominent road, one that doesn’t just serve the Black community, but transcends it.”
What often results, he said, is a compromise shaped by resistance: King’s name confined to a short stretch of roadway, frequently within historically Black neighborhoods, a form of symbolic recognition that mirrors the very segregation King spent his life challenging.
“That’s what makes street naming so controversial,” Alderman said. “It’s not really a question of whether we will remember Dr. King. It’s a question of where we will remember him. Where we choose to remember King plays a major role in shaping the meaning of that commemoration.”
 Unfinished symbols and the cost of commemoration

For all their visibility, Martin Luther King, Jr. streets carry a deep contradiction. They are meant to honor a man who preached economic justice and structural change, yet many of the corridors that bear his name remain sites of concentrated poverty and neglect.
That pattern, Alderman said, is not accidental.
“MLK streets are often placed in historically Black neighborhoods that have already experienced redlining, urban renewal and disinvestment,” he said. “So what you get is this uncomfortable reality where we symbolically honor Dr. King, but materially fail to address the inequalities that his work was fundamentally about.”
Research has repeatedly shown that the symbolism of MLK street-naming is rarely matched by economic investment. A 2020 study found that areas surrounding MLK-named streets are, on average, more segregated and significantly poorer than the national norm, with property values that consistently lag behind the rest of their cities. In majority-Black neighborhoods, homes are routinely appraised 20 to 23%lower than comparable properties in white neighborhoods, limiting wealth-building while increasing financial burden. Property values shape everyday life, influencing whether families can build wealth, access credit, fund public schools and pass stability to the next generation.










None of this happens without Black activism. Black communities, Black clergy, and those who have pushed very hard to get King’s name on a prominent road, one that doesn’t just serve the Black community, but transcends it.


– Derek Alderman, Ph.D., University of Tennessee 


On Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue in East Knoxville, longtime business owner Tanika Harper said the street’s name has always carried weight but not protection. Her family, through the generations, has held on to property on the road for decades, and she says it’s intentional.
“I’m proud to be on MLK, ” Harper said, speaking of the commercial building space her father originally operated his long standing lawncare company out for decades. “We’ve always found ways to thrive. I want to see this become a corridor that truly reflects Dr. King’s vision, where people can live, work, heal and build generational wealth. The potential is here. What’s needed now is the will to invest in people, not just property.”
Alderman argues that street naming should be understood not as a finish line, but as a starting point, one that forces cities to confront whether they are willing to back symbolism with policy, resources, and sustained investment, particularly at a moment when public commitments to racial equity and diversity initiatives are being openly dismantled.
“The name should come with a commitment,” Alderman said. “Otherwise, it becomes a reminder of what cities are willing to say, and what they’re unwilling to do.”
 Nashville: Putting King in the path of power

Nashville’s connection to King predates nearly every other Tennessee city. Long before street signs bore his name, the city served as a proving ground for the modern civil rights movement. In 1960, Black college students launched sit-ins that dismantled segregation at downtown lunch counters, drawing King to the city that spring, where he praised Nashville’s campaign as among the most disciplined in the South.
Yet despite that legacy, Nashville waited nearly six decades to place King’s name on a street tied to political power.

That changed in 2018, when the Metro Council approved renaming a portion of Charlotte Avenue, a major corridor adjacent to the Tennessee State Capitol, as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard. The decision came during the 50th anniversary year of King’s assassination, sharpening questions of how, and where, his legacy should be honored.
The legislation was led by then Metro Councilmember Sharon Hurt, a Memphis native who said the idea had stayed with her long before she held public office.
“I had seen Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevards all over the country,” Hurt said. “And typically, those streets reside in the African American community. Considering the contributions he made and how he brought so many people together, I felt his legacy deserved recognition beyond that.”
Once elected, Hurt said she became intentional not just about whether King should be honored, but where.
“I find it poetic justice that he was assassinated in the state of Tennessee,” she said. “With the Capitol on Charlotte Avenue, even naming a portion of that street mattered. I wanted something that could actually succeed.”
As she researched the corridor’s past, Hurt uncovered deeper layers of meaning. Charlotte Avenue was once Cedar Street, an area tied to Black residency, the slave trade and even the construction of the Capitol itself.
“There was an African American man who fell into a hole during the building of the state capitol and was never recovered,” Hurt said. “He’s actually buried there. All of that history is part of that street.”
The ordinance moved swiftly and was signed on April 4, 2018, the anniversary of King’s death.
“It was probably one of the most significant pieces of legislation that I passed,” Hurt said. “I’m very proud of it.”
Still, she is clear-eyed about what symbolism alone can and cannot do.
“A lot of what cities do around civil rights is performative,” Hurt said. “There’s no real equity if you’re not addressing the economic divide, the lack of investment in Black businesses, and the systems that still disadvantage Black communities.”
 Memphis: Still reckoning with the mountaintop

If Nashville’s debate centered on proximity to power, Memphis’s struggle was shaped by its grief.
In 1968, King came to Memphis to stand with striking sanitation workers demanding dignity, fair wages, and recognition of their humanity. On April 3, he delivered his final public address, the “Mountaintop” speech, at Mason Temple. He was assassinated the following day at the Lorraine Motel.
Few cities are as permanently linked to King’s final days as Memphis, a reality that weighed heavily on former City Councilmember Berlin Boyd.
“Being in Memphis, the city where Dr. King was assassinated, I was appalled that there were over 900 cities across the country with streets honoring his legacy, but here, where he lost his life, we didn’t have one,” Boyd said.
The delay was not for lack of effort. As early as the 1970s, Rev. James Netters pushed Memphis leaders to rename a street for King in an attempt that failed.
In 2012, Boyd introduced legislation to rename a downtown stretch of Linden Avenue as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue. The location was deliberate.
“You’re talking about Clayborn Temple, the sanitation workers’ march toward City Hall, and then his assassination at the Lorraine Motel,” Boyd said. “That’s the significance behind Linden Avenue.”
For Boyd, the decades-long delay reflected Memphis’s complicated relationship with its past.

“When something is painful, people tend to brush it under the rug and think it will go away,” he said. “But nobody ever really stopped to say, ‘Let’s honor him here because this is where it happened.’”
Unlike many MLK corridors nationwide, Linden Avenue now sits amid visible investment. Boyd pointed to redevelopment in the downtown core as evidence that the street may finally begin to reflect King’s legacy.
“You see economic growth in the area where we placed our street,” Boyd said. “But just naming a street after Dr. King doesn’t define what he stood for. There’s still a lot of work that needs to be done.”
 Chattanooga: From the big nine to the river

Chattanooga became one of Tennessee’s earliest testing grounds for King street-naming, not only because of when it happened, but because of where city leaders initially tried to draw the line.
“It was one of the first cases I ever encountered,” Alderman said. “A colleague sent me newspaper clippings years ago, and what struck me was that this was a city where activists actually pulled this off politically. They started the process before the King holiday was even established. That’s a real testament to Chattanooga’s traditions of protest and moral clarity.”
In the years following King’s assassination, Black ministers and community leaders pushed to rename Ninth Street, a historically Black commercial corridor known as “The Big Nine.” Once a thriving hub of Black-owned businesses, music, and nightlife, the street’s decline mirrored broader patterns of segregation, urban renewal, and disinvestment.










9th Street was where African Americans were. But the rest of Martin Luther King Boulevard runs to the river, right into prime downtown real estate. And they were very vocal about not wanting to name that portion.


– Rev, William Terry Wood


In 1981, the Chattanooga City Commission initially rejected the proposal, signaling a willingness to rename only East Ninth Street, the portion running through the historically Black neighborhood, while leaving West Ninth, which extended into downtown and prime commercial real estate, untouched.
“Typically, streets are easy to name because they’re already in the Black community,” said Rev.  William Terry Ladd, whose church sits merely blocks away. “That’s usually where the compromise happens.”
Organizers refused to accept it.
“9th Street was where African Americans were. But the rest of Martin Luther King Boulevard runs to the river, right into prime downtown real estate. And they were very vocal about not wanting to name that portion,” Ladd said.
Instead, Black clergy mobilized. In April 1981, hundreds of residents marched up and down Ninth Street, taping bumper stickers reading “Martin Luther King” over existing street signs, symbolically renaming the corridor themselves.
“They unofficially, but defiantly, renamed the street,” said Alderman. “They were repeating the tactics of the civil rights movement to make a claim about public space.”
Ladd said he was not surprised Chattanooga moved early.
“You had pastors who weren’t originally from Chattanooga,” he said. “Many of them went to places like Morehouse (College). They were exposed to a broader theology of justice.”
Later that year, the City Commission reversed course, officially renaming all of Ninth Street as Martin Luther King Boulevard.
“Location shapes meaning,” Alderman said. “And Chattanooga understood that early.”

 Knoxville: A door-to-door commitment on East Vine

In Knoxville, the fight unfolded a block at a time.
Charles Mathes, a longtime teacher at Austin High School, spent more than two decades advocating for East Vine and McCalla avenues to be renamed for King. But it was in 1988 that the effort took on new urgency.
That year, Charlene Lewis, Anna Dirl, and a small group of community leaders began walking door to door along East Vine Avenue, carrying a petition asking the city to rename the corridor for King. Lewis had been a sixth grader when King was assassinated, too young to fully grasp the moment but old enough to absorb the stories passed down through her family.
“As I heard these stories, it became more important to me to see us not just get along, but actually make a difference,” Lewis later recalled.
“We knew this wasn’t going to happen unless we did something,” said Rev. Harold Middlebrook of a campaign to name a Knoxville street for Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. (Photo: Screengrab, Knoxville.tn.gov.)
The effort was deeply grassroots, rooted in churches and neighborhood networks, and grounded in a shared understanding of Vine Avenue’s role as the heart of Black Knoxville before urban renewal hollowed it out.
Rev. Harold Middlebrook, a civil rights leader with personal ties to King through Morehouse College, helped lead what he called a commitment to “walking the walk.”
“We had to do more than sit around talking about it,” Middlebrook said. “We knew this wasn’t going to happen unless we did something.”
Not everyone welcomed the change. Lewis recalled at least one business owner using a racist slur in opposition to King’s name. Still, organizers pressed forward, delivering a petition with hundreds of signatures to city officials in January 1989.
That spring, Knoxville unanimously approved the request, creating a three-mile stretch of Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue through East Knoxville.
For Middlebrook, the street would come to represent both progress and unfinished work.
“We had no idea at that time this would become part of history,” he said. “But we knew it mattered.”

(Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson made his name in the U.S. House as the “TikTok Congressman.” Now, he’s again staking out real estate at the technological forefront by heading up a nationwide task force on AI.
Stepping into the attorney general’s office in a year where Trump has sought to halt funding for everything from SNAP benefits to hurricane resilience grants to public school funding — all blocked after court battles that Jackson’s N.C. Department of Justice helped win — the former Congressman has come to view his office as a last line of defense for North Carolinians, both from the executive branch and from the threats of tomorrow.
To lead that defense, he has stressed a united front across party lines. “We are stronger when we speak with one voice,” he told dozens of attorneys general at the AI Task Force’s inaugural meeting last week.
But in his own state, Republicans are vying to strip him of one of his most potent tools: the ability to challenge Trump’s executive orders. The state Senate passed a bill last March that would require the General Assembly to authorize any such lawsuits, and the state House could do the same as it returns for the short session this month.
A term defined by Trump
More than anything else, Jackson’s first year in office has been defined by its lawsuits in defiance of the Trump administration.
Most notably, they won an October court battle that required the Trump administration to disburse $230 million in SNAP benefits to 1.4 million North Carolinians during last fall’s government shutdown. Other successful lawsuits challenged the revocation of more than $165 million in public education funding and $200 million in FEMA resilience dollars.

In Jackson’s view, his office has undertaken a principled approach on executive orders. Whereas some Democratic attorney generals have joined more than 60 lawsuits challenging the Trump administration, his office was only part of 18 in 2025.
“I use an objective formula for when I file a lawsuit against the administration or anyone else,” Jackson told NC Newsline. “Did someone break the law? Did it hurt the state? And can I prove both of those things?”
He has repeatedly stressed that North Carolina’s participation in these lawsuits is often key to recovering blocked funds through court injunctions that only apply to the parties to the lawsuit. Jackson announced in January that his office had recovered a total of $1.5 billion in stalled funds in 2025.
Jackson’s office declined to join some lawsuits against the Trump administration on more divisive issues, particularly around social issues. He did not join, for example, a lawsuit against the Department of Health and Human Services earlier this month challenging an executive order mandating health and education institutions to abide by its definition of biological sex rather than gender identity.
In the view of Western Carolina University political scientist Chris Cooper, “it doesn’t appear that he’s just throwing stuff at the wall to see what sticks.”
“I think he’s choosing cases where he thinks they have a chance to win, and that are going to present as, yes, partisan, but not hyperpartisan and not leaning into the negative,” Cooper said. “What he’s chosen to shoot, he’s been hitting.”
‘AG TikTok’
As the gears began moving on Senate Bill 58, the proposal that would strip Jackson of autonomy on challenges to executive orders, North Carolina Republicans issued a stark warning: Comply or else.
Asked by Sen. Julie Mayfield (D-Buncombe) in February what lawmakers would do if the Attorney General defies a new mandate on executive orders, Sen. Tim Moffitt (R-Henderson) suggested his role could be obliterated by repealing every power granted to it by state law.
“That way, the Attorney General is a feckless, empty shell of a position that has no authority to do anything,” Moffitt said.
Jackson has seemed to draw more ire from Republicans in a single year from Republican state lawmakers than his predecessor, Gov. Josh Stein, did in eight. But he’s also maintained a higher profile than any attorney general before him.
The TikToks that made him famous in Congress have continued — churning out 11 since he entered the attorney general’s office and sharing them across X, Bluesky, Reddit, and Instragram among other platforms.
While they have shifted from the political news dominating Congress to the lawsuits his office is taking on, they have at times retained an adversarial tone — directed at those his office is probing.
“Hi. This message is for WeChat,” he said in a video in May. “You are the second-largest texting platform in the world. You’re also heavily implicated in the money laundering that is tied to trafficking fentanyl.”
In a TikTok post on Jan. 15, 2026, Jackson touted his office’s win against the Trump administration over withheld FEMA funding. (Photo: TikTok)
“The pattern is clear, and your app is at the center of it. So I reached out to some other attorneys general in both parties and asked them to join me in confronting you,” he said. “You’ve known about your role in this for years, and now, so does everyone else.”
In another video, he addressed 37 companies he accused of facilitating robocalls by name. His office has sought to crack down on robocalls routed through North Carolina, winning a court order fining an AI voice provider $5 million for enabling them.
Opponents see moves like these as evidence of showmanship, rather than statesmanship. And it’s made him an outsized target for the animus of North Carolina Republicans.
Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger, in comments on social media in October, linked S58 to Jackson’s social media stardom directly — retweeting a radio host who derided Jackson as “AG TikTok.”
“This is exactly why Senate Republicans passed a bill to restrict Jeff Jackson from filing frivolous lawsuits against @POTUS,” Berger wrote. “The AG should be focused on working for the people of NC, not his social media followers.”
In his meetings with Republicans, Jackson has stressed that he wants to lead the state DOJ without partisanship.
“I think it deserves to be done in a nonpartisan way. That was how I campaigned,” Jackson said in an interview with NC Newsline. “I told people that this job has to be about the protection of people and not a political party, and that’s what I believe, that’s how I’ve tried to lead the office.”
But many in the state GOP see his broadsides against the Trump administration as evidence that his lawsuits are driven by political animus.
North Carolina Republican Party spokesman Matt Mercer said he sees little evidence of Jackson leading in a nonpartisan way. “He seems like he’s chosen to take on that partisan mantle versus trying to find areas of agreement with the Trump administration to enforce the law,” Mercer said.
“He’s not leading on these things. He’s signing on to what attorneys general in California and New York and Illinois are doing,” Mercer said. “He’s just falling in line.”
What Jackson touts as a signature achievement, recovering SNAP benefits for North Carolinians, Mercer argued was unnecessary. “Whose fault was it that we had the shutdown to begin with? It was Jeff Jackson’s party.”
‘Refreshingly bipartisan’
Despite battles with Republicans in his own state, Jackson is set to meet his biggest task of the coming year alongside a member of the GOP: Utah Attorney General Derek Brown, with whom he’s co-chairing the AI task force.
Launching the task force in November capped off a first year in office in which Jackson sought to position himself at the forefront of emerging technological challenges without regulatory answers at a time when, in his view, the federal government has abdicated responsibility.

The Trump administration has not only declined to issue regulations on AI, Jackson noted, but it has also sought to prevent the states from enacting their own. A December order from Trump’s White House promises to “check the most onerous and excessive laws emerging from the States that threaten to stymie innovation,” warning it will  revoke funding from states that do not comply.
“In my conversations with state legislators, there’s a general understanding that it would be bad if there was executive action that obsoleted all of the AI-related laws that the state has passed.” Jackson said in the interview. “So far, I will say, the response has been refreshingly bipartisan.”
The task force, which formed just a month before that order, has said its work will continue nonetheless.
“This is a perfect demonstration of why, frankly, the Tenth Amendment matters. States really are laboratories of democracy, and I think we’re faster, we are more nimble,” said Brown, the Utah Attorney General.
Jackson said he believes the risks of leaving AI up to Congress far exceed any downsides of a patchwork approach between the states.
“You really don’t want to end up in a situation where the state safeguards have been swept away and then the federal government does nothing, which is the most likely outcome here, as we saw with social media, as we’ve seen with the internet privacy, even for kids,” he said.“The most likely outcome for congressional response to massive new technology is to do virtually nothing.”
He said he hopes to focus on digital hazards like voice cloning, deep fakes, and AI robocalls. His office has also paid special focus to e-commerce. In 2025, his office made inquiries into leading “buy now, pay later” platforms as well as the online commerce giant Shopify. Jackson also called out fraudulent websites and Instagram ads that go to fake companies as sources of concern for his office in the interview with NC Newsline.
‘The leader of an institution’
Jackson’s stint as attorney general is his first time engaging with the public in an executive, rather than legislative, role. It’s also the first time North Carolinians have seen him attempt to shed partisan colors after years of viral TikToks condemning state Senate and U.S. House Republicans.
In a November leadership talk to Duke students and faculty named for former Gov. Terry Sanford, Jackson stressed the importance of reaching out to Republican attorneys general and state lawmakers. Those conversations, he said, are crucial in a time of stark polarization.
“If all I did was diminish some antagonism, that’s worth it. If I took someone from 100% opposed to 70%, y’all, that’s a win,” Jackson said at the Duke forum. “We get out of a lot of meetings being like, I don’t think he hates me. I think he dislikes me!”

His military background has informed his executive leadership style, leading him to seek out “mission-driven” team members and taking a person-to-person approach with as many members of his staff as possible. “You’ve got to give them a sense of who you are.”
That experience, he said, led him to post up at the NCDOJ entrance with his 10-year-old son on his first day and shake hands with every employee who walked in. He also joined a sunrise workout of basic law enforcement training cadets in Asheville, which he also saw as an effort to better understand criminal justice in the state at the ground level.
“What is Jeff Jackson really trying to do in all of this? Is he trying to position himself to run for U.S. Senate in 2028, or for governor in 2028 or 2032, or is he trying to do his job?” asked Mercer, the GOP spokesman.
For his part, Jackson said he does not wish to leave his current role any time soon. When asked in an interview with NC Newsline whether he was considering a Senate run, he said, “Nope.”
“This job is wonderful in what you can actually accomplish. And in that respect, it’s very different than serving in Congress,” he said. “As attorney general, you can make a big difference every day.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/PB124952-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-19 06:57:16.821947

Every January, 100 people elected to the Colorado General Assembly gather in Denver for 120 days and make decisions that affect students and teachers in the classroom, university administrators trying to balance their budgets, and parents and students having to make tuition payments.
There are only two bills that legislators have to pass before they adjourn in May: a balanced budget and the school finance act. Both have profound implications for educational opportunity.
Lawmakers also tackle many more education issues, from school meals to school safety, from what students should learn in the classroom to workforce training.
But it can be hard for ordinary citizens to understand how ideas turn into laws.
To explain the lawmaking process and the opportunities for public input, Chalkbeat has prepared this guide to the legislative session, which start last week, and how you can get involved:
How a bill becomes a law
Think Schoolhouse Rock’s “I’m Just a Bill.”
Legislators get ideas for bills from a lot of places. A legislator might have a passion for a particular topic. The governor’s office or leaders of state agencies might request a policy change. An interest group or ordinary citizens might ask a lawmaker to help solve a problem.
Lawmakers work with bill drafters — nonpartisan legislative staff — to write a bill. Once a lawmaker introduces it, leaders in either the House or the Senate assign it to a committee, usually one with relevant expertise.
Most education bills go to a chamber’s education committee, but a bill on youth mental health might land first in the health committee, or one on police in schools might be heard by the judiciary committee.
A few committees — most infamously the State Affairs committees — are known as “kill” committees, where leadership can send controversial bills, especially those from the opposing parties, to ensure they don’t reach the floor.
A bill must win committee approval to proceed to the full House or Senate. Some bills might need to go through more than one committee.
Bills must get approved twice in the first chamber, before heading to the next chamber, where they go through the process all over again. Bills can be amended at any point in the process, and both chambers must sign off on the same final form of a bill for it to clear the legislature.
Then the governor decides whether to sign it into law.
Who has a vote on the Colorado education committees
For this session, the House Education Committee has 13 members — eight Democrats and five Republicans:

Chair Rep. Meghan Lukens, a Steamboat Springs Democrat
Vice Chair Rep. Matthew Martinez, a Monte Vista Democrat
Rep. Jennifer Bacon, a Denver Democrat
Rep. Mary Bradfield, a Colorado Springs Republican
Rep. Ava Flanell, a Colorado Springs Republican
Rep. Lori Garcia Sander, an Eaton Republican
Rep. Lindsay Gilchrist, a Denver Democrat
Rep. Eliza Hamrick, a Centennial Democrat
Rep. Anthony Hartsook, a Parker Republican
Rep. Dusty Johnson, a Fort Morgan Republican
Rep. Jacque Phillips, a Thornton Democrat
Rep. Katie Stewart, a Durango Democrat
Rep. Tammy Story, a Conifer Democrat

Find the committee schedule, documents, and live and archived audio of its meetings at the committee website.
The Senate Education Committee has seven members — four Democrats and three Republicans:

Chair Sen. Chris Kolker, a Centennial Democrat
Vice Chair Sen. Janice Marchman, a Loveland Democrat
Sen. Scott Bright, a Platteville Republican
Sen. Lisa Frizel, a Castle Rock Republican
Sen. Cathy Kipp, a Fort Collins Democrat
Sen. Dafna Michaelson Jenet, a Commerce City Democrat
Sen. Janice Rich, a Grand Junction Republican

Can you speak on a bill or submit testimony?
If you’re interested in having your perspective heard, there are a few ways to get involved.
You can speak on the bill in person or remotely, or submit a written statement to the committee. The sign-up process is not difficult. Just fill out this online form.
Speakers are generally limited to two to three minutes, so think about how to make your point quickly and clearly.
Want to know the schedule?
The full schedule of the House and Senate can typically be found online on the Colorado General Assembly website’s landing page.
The session schedule should be posted daily and gets updated as bills move through the process.
How to look up Colorado General Assembly bills
Looking for a bill online? Go to the Colorado General Assembly’s bill search page. There you can search by a bill number, the sponsor, or a topic.
When you click on a bill, you’ll see a summary of what the bill does, the full text of the bill, and other relevant information, such as a fiscal note that explains how much passing the law would cost the state. Often the description of a bill in the fiscal note is easier to understand than the bill language itself.
You can also search through tabs near the bottom of the page that include the bill’s history, when it’s scheduled to be heard again, any amendments, and a summary of the committee votes.
What’s the Joint Budget Committee, and why is it so important?
The six-member Joint Budget Committee is the most influential committee in the Colorado General Assembly. Why? Because it writes the budget that guides the state’s priorities. The committee members this year are four Democrats and two Republicans, with Rep. Emily Sirota, a Denver Democrat, as chair.
Yes, Gov. Jared Polis does submit a budget every November. And the governor’s priorities guide the Joint Budget Committee’s work. But the committee ultimately writes the budget that gets submitted to the General Assembly for approval.
Other lawmakers also have a chance to submit budget amendments that reflect their own spending priorities — but lawmakers need to pass a balanced budget, and the Joint Budget Committee will strip out amendments that endanger that goal.
The budget shapes every facet of state government, including K-12 and higher education spending.

(Photo by Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)The new year has barely begun, but the 2026 campaign season is well underway.
This month’s special primaries for a pair of legislative seats kicked off the year’s elections, and more key dates for voters are on the way.
Arkansas’ midterm elections include several high-profile races, including the reelection bids of Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders and U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton.
To prepare for the elections, voters will need to know the rules and how to register. Here’s what to know about voter registration in Arkansas:
 To vote in the March 3 primary, when do I need to be registered to vote? 
In Arkansas, voters need to register at least 30 days before the election they want to vote in. For the 2026 regular primary, that falls on Feb. 1, a Sunday, so potential voters will need to register by Feb. 2, according to Chris Powell, the director of public affairs for the Arkansas Secretary of State’s office.
Those who moved within the state and need to register in a new county must register at least four days prior to the election.
 Can I register to vote online? 
No.
According to the secretary of state’s website, those who wish to vote in Arkansas must fill out a paper registration form.
The form can be downloaded from the secretary of state’s website and printed, obtained from state revenue or motor vehicle offices, public libraries or local county clerks. Forms can be mailed to the secretary of state’s office, or completed in-person at a local county clerk’s office. If the form is mailed, it must be postmarked at least 30 days prior to the election.
 Who is eligible to vote? 
Any U.S. citizen over the age of 18 who lives in Arkansas. If someone turns 18 before the next election, then they are also able to register. People convicted of a felony who have not had their sentence discharged or pardoned are not eligible to vote.
 What kind of documentation do I need to register? 
Arkansans will need to provide either their Arkansas drivers license, or, if they don’t have a drivers license, the last four digits of their social security number in order to register. However, on election day, Arkansans may use passports, identification issued by accredited postsecondary educational institutions, a military ID or other forms of photo ID if they wish.

(COURTESY AKA LAMBDA PI OMEGA CHAPTER)
This story was originally reported by Ebony JJ Curry of The 19th.  Meet Ebony and read more of their reporting on gender, politics and policy.
Detroit was the first place Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered an early version of what would become his “I Have a Dream” speech. He recited it on June 23, 1963, at the end of Detroit’s Walk to Freedom, a march that happened weeks before he spoke on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C.
This piece of Detroit-first history sharpens what Martin Luther King Jr. Day asks of the city. It’s harder to treat the holiday, celebrated on Monday, as a slogan when the dream was first spoken aloud in Detroit. It’s also harder to see it as a day off when a lot of people choose to mark it every year as a day on.
The Lambda Pi Omega chapter of the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated, is one of the Detroit institutions built around that belief.
Their members measure the weeks before Martin Luther King Jr. Day in labor. They assemble toiletry kits for Detroiters without stable housing, volunteer their time to youth programs focused on combating hunger and fostering leadership skills, and step into the gaps families are already navigating, like hunger and lack of resources. Crystal Sewell, the chapter’s president, said the work is rooted in service that isn’t just a once-a-year thing.
“Our work really is about uplifting our community; that is really at the heart of what we do,” Sewell said. “It is sisterhood and service for the betterment of our local community, that’s really the essence and the spirit of our chapter.”
This year, LPO will spend Martin Luther King Jr. Day at Third New Hope Baptist Church on Detroit’s west side for its annual “We Are One” AKA Day of Service. Sorority members plan to assemble 1,908 toiletry bags for Detroit Rescue Mission Ministries, a local nonprofit that provides emergency shelter and support services, including housing programs for families and people working toward recovery. The specificity in the number of kits is intentional: 1,908 reflects AKA’s founding year, 1908. After the event, the bags will be delivered to the rescue mission’s family shelter and recovery housing sites.
The chapter’s service calendar stays full throughout the year, Sewell said.
“If I were to add it up, I would say we participate in at least 10 volunteer opportunities per month,” she said. “So, you’re talking 100 to 150 volunteer service opportunities per year. There are several hours that go into our volunteerism, over 2,000 hours per year.”
LPO is part of the Divine Nine — nine historically Black fraternities and sororities under the National Pan-Hellenic Council, founded when Black students, excluded from White Greek systems, created their own organizations around scholarship, leadership and service.
Dr. King was part of that tradition.
He was initiated into Boston’s Sigma chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha in June 1952. Alpha Phi Alpha (APA) was founded in 1906 as the first Black Greek-letter fraternity; AKA is the first Black Greek-letter sorority.
AKA’s purpose statement includes a directive members repeat as a standard: to be of “service to all mankind.”
Jacqueline Newman has spent decades living by that. She became an AKA member in 1970 at Wayne State University. When the sorority’s LPO chapter was chartered in Detroit in 1977, she became a founding charter member. She now serves as the chapter historian.
“What we do is we try to help, whenever we can, wherever we can,” Newman said. “We love children, so we are in different schools to help feed students. We’ve clothed students. We’ve given Thanksgiving baskets. We’ve given scholarships, and it was not only to women or girls. It has been to men also. And no matter your race. That’s what I look at as service to all mankind, to all people that are in need. That’s what we do.”
Newman’s own timeline begins in the South. She was 13 and living in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, when Dr. King spoke in Detroit in 1963.
“I was part of the South that he was trying to free from civil rights injustices,” she said.

She moved to Detroit in 1965 with her family. “My mom and my dad were teachers and the employment was better here in Detroit,” Newman said. Her mother became a member of AKA in 1962; Newman described her own membership as legacy. “So, it was mainly a legacy for me. I followed in my mom’s footsteps.”
Her history of service began before she joined AKA. In the South, she said, “I saw so many injustices done, especially to our people. I was marching and doing civil rights things when I was 11, 12, 13 years old before I came here to Michigan.”
Those experiences compelled her to action — “you don’t want anybody else to have to go through what you went through,” Newman said.
“When you have seen a man hung on a tree, it hits you a little more,” Newman said. “If you have lived through it, it’s different.”
Detroit remembers Dr. King’s dream speech because it heard it early. Lambda Pi Omega is betting its Martin Luther King Jr. Day on a simpler goal: what gets done, who gets served, and whether the work continues when the holiday ends.
As Sewell said, service is about direct support and long-term civic work.
“Service for me is about uplifting others within our community who are of greatest need,” she said. “It is advocating for social justice, making sure our community is informed and educated and registered to vote and getting out to vote, thinking about the whole of the individual, from cradle to senior.”",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AKA-service03.jpg-1024x683.webp,,,2026-01-19 06:57:16.821947

(Photo by Brett Bowers/Getty Images)Today we celebrate the life, work and enduring legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., a leader whose vision of a beloved community calls us to build a society rooted in dignity, strengthened by diversity, guided by equality, and sustained by joy. 
In Idaho, this day also marks Idaho Human Rights Day — a distinction that reflects both our aspirations and our complicated history. Across the country, MLK Day is widely observed with marches, speeches and reflections on the American promise of liberty and justice for all. But in Idaho, that recognition did not come easily. 
This struggle to be seen and honored reminds us why Dr. King’s vision of a beloved community matters now more than ever. He challenged us to confront injustice, tell hard truths and dedicate ourselves to collective care. 
At a moment when legislation increasingly threatens to roll back hard-won progress, and when efforts to erase difficult chapters of our national story are gaining traction, his vision is more vital than ever. Today is not only a day of remembrance. It is a day of responsibility. 
In Idaho and beyond, we are called to reexamine whether our actions truly align with our values. Are we living up to the ideals we claim to hold? 
MLK Day became a federal holiday in 1983, but Idaho was slow to adopt it. Some lawmakers objected to a day dedicated to one person, particularly a person of color they characterized as having “communist tendencies.” 
After years of public advocacy in support of the holiday, a pivotal moment came in 1989 when Boise State University student Eric Love organized a peaceful march to the Idaho Capitol. More than 700 students and community members gathered to demand recognition of Martin Luther King, Jr.’s legacy.

Bill Wassmuth, the Wassmuth Center for Human Rights‘ namesake, spoke that day about the deep connection between civil and human rights and joined the crowd in singing “We Shall Overcome.” It was a powerful expression of what a beloved community looks like in action: people coming together across differences to insist on the dignity of all. 
In 1990, a compromise finally led Gov. Cecil Andrus to establish Martin Luther King Jr. – Idaho Human Rights Day, making Idaho the 47th state to recognize the holiday. The dual designation was intentional, affirming that civil rights and human rights are inseparable and that both belong to everyone. Idaho remains unique in this combined observance. 
Today, however, we are witnessing a troubling reversal of those historic efforts. Laws dismantling diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives; policies restricting bodily autonomy and health care; attacks on public education; and attempts to rewrite history all undermine the very freedoms Dr. King and countless others worked to secure. 
Threats and violence toward people based on race, ethnicity or immigration status violate not only our shared humanity, but the fundamental rights promised by our Constitution. These actions stand in direct opposition to the legacies of Dr. King, Bill Wassmuth, Eric Love and so many others who worked to advance civil and human rights. 
We often hear appeals to “Idaho values” and “American values,” but this moment requires us to be specific: which values, and toward what kind of community? Dr. King’s vision of a beloved community provides a clear answer — one defined by dignity, safety, opportunity and shared responsibility for one another. 
These principles reflect the best of who we are as Idahoans and Americans. As we reflect on that vision today, we must ask whether our words and actions are actively shaping a community that embodies these values. Living out this vision requires more than reflection. It demands intentional action in our everyday choices. 
One way is to hold fast to your values and align your actions accordingly. 
If you value community, find ways to connect and care for others. If you value dignity, let your words and actions reflect the shared humanity of every person you encounter. If you value inclusion, be intentional about creating spaces of belonging at home, at work and in your neighborhood.
When we pause, reflect and live into our values through our actions, we carry forward the work of those who came before us. Together, we can continue building a beloved community where human and civil rights are honored, protected and shared by all.

Haley Stevens is continuing to raise concerns about private equity deals in college sports, reaching out to the President of the National College Athletics Association ahead of Monday’s college football playoff national  championship game for information on how to prevent college athletics programs from being sold to the highest bidder. 
The Birmingham Democrat joined U.S. Rep. Michael Baumgartner (R-Wash.) in penning a letter to NCAA President Charlie Baker, expressing their concern following several reports of NCAA member universities exploring deals with private equity firms, or companies whose stocks are not publicly traded. 
As part of their letter, Stevens and Baumgartner submitted a list of questions about the NCAA’s decision-making and enforcement mechanisms to prevent profit-seeking firms from buying up stakes in university athletics, requesting a response by Feb. 15. 
“College sports are a uniquely American tradition that have provided invaluable experiences for generations of college athletes, students, and fans,” Stevens and Baumgartner wrote. “As the people’s representatives, we have a responsibility to ensure that the integrity of universities and college sports is preserved for future generations of Americans, not sacrificed for short-term financial gain – especially where outside investors may gain leverage over decisions that should remain accountable to university communities.”
In November, Stevens sent a letter to Big Ten Conference Commissioner Tony Petitti following reports that the Big Ten was mulling selling 10% of its media rights to UC Investments, a group affiliated with the University of California system pension fund, for $2.4 billion.
The Big 12 Conference and the University of Utah are also reportedly looking at selling portions of their athletics revenue streams to outside investors, while the Southeastern Conference, the University of Notre Dame, and Florida State University have also reported outreach from private equity investors.
“Ceding control or meaningful governance rights tied to athletics revenues to entities that do not have to answer to students, faculty, staff, alumni, or local communities would erode the public-serving mission of universities and encourage increasingly profit-driven decision-making,” Stevens and Baumgartner wrote. “Private equity firms, principally concerned with maximizing their return on investment, have little incentive to protect or promote non-revenue sports, including those required under Title IX, that have provided a path to college and life-changing experiences for generations of college athletes.

The Fargo City Commission voted 3-2 earlier this month to dissolve the Human Rights Commission in its current advisory role. City commissioners gave the board two months to come up with a plan to restructure in a way that taps fewer city resources, both financial and staffing.
Last week, the human rights group began discussing its options at a working session.
“The best thing we can do is come together so marginalized people in Fargo have a voice,” said Sekou Sirleaf, chairman of the advisory board.

But while much of the conversation focused on next steps, several members of the board and the public who attended the meeting voiced frustrations about recent actions of the City Commission.
“It’s a strong, horrible message from our city leaders,” said Barry Nelson, who among many other roles has served on the city’s Human Rights Commission in the past. “It shows where this city’s priorities are.”
Moving the commission to a community-based or nonprofit model could lessen its impact, said Nelson.
After the meeting, Sirleaf said the city of Fargo has a pattern of not supporting diverse, marginalized community members. The dismantling of the Human Rights Commission is the latest example, he said.
He observed that city commissioners voted on the board’s future less than a month after the Human Rights Commission accused city leaders of failing to support the Somali community when President Donald Trump made disparaging remarks about the immigrant group in neighboring Minnesota.
He pointed to the city commission’s decision to eliminate a three-year-old Diversity, Equity and Inclusion department in September 2024. 
In addition, this year commissioners did not approve funds to sponsor community events that honor Martin Luther King Jr. Day and Juneteenth. Those costs were $17,886 and $12,500 respectively. Martin Luther King Jr. Day has been a longstanding event reaching back to at least 2002.
“Fargo is the most diverse city in North Dakota, but our city government and its decisions don’t reflect that,” Sirleaf said.  
Fargo administrators referred a request for comment to the city’s spokesperson, who emailed a statement from Brenda Derrig, the assistant city administrator:
“While the City is no longer sponsoring MLK or Juneteenth events, the City continues to recognize the significance of both observances. On MLK Day and Juneteenth, community members are encouraged to take time to honor these observances, whether that is through service, learning or engagement within the community,” she wrote.
Derrig said funding was pulled because the city was prioritizing core services and evaluating how social services and arts funding is allocated.

Fargo Mayor Tim Mahoney did not respond to an email requesting comment on the issue. Mahoney drafted a memo to the Fargo Commission for its Jan. 5 meeting saying that the city had spent the past year identifying ways to streamline the city’s volunteer boards and commissions, including the Human Rights Commission. The intent, he wrote, is that community members could continue these efforts “as independent community organizations without reliance on city staff or resources, but with continued city partnerships.”
The Fargo Human Relations Commission was founded in 2000 to promote acceptance and respect for diversity and discourage all forms of discrimination. In 2021, it was renamed the Human Rights Commission, according to the city website. 
Fargo City Commissioner John Strand was among those who voted to disband the commission, but supported giving the group two months to come up with a different structure. He said there’s value in government hearing from diverse voices, but city advisory boards are limited by finances and governmental procedures. He said the board could be more effective if it doesn’t fall entirely under city jurisdiction.
He would like to see the Human Rights Commission morph into an entity that has appeal to the broader community.
“My hope is we can develop something that is connected to others in the state,” he said. “I would still like to see a city liaison appointed to the entity.”
Human rights commissions act as a local safeguard for civil rights and to promote inclusion. But these types of groups are not often established by local governments in North Dakota. 
The Minot City Council discussed restoring a human relations committee in 2023, but ultimately voted to dissolve it, according to meeting minutes.
Grand Forks has not had a human rights committee associated with city government in the past two decades, according to John Bernstrom, the city’s public information officer.
Sargianna Wutzke is chair of the Bismarck Human Relations Committee. She said a couple years ago, a Bismarck city commissioner observed there wasn’t a place for community members to talk about important issues. In response, the committee started a quarterly forum on topics of importance. 
Over the past year, the committee has hosted open conversations on issues like housing, accessibility and transportation. The format starts with presentations from experts and people with lived experience. Then the public is invited to share concerns and possible solutions.
A recent event on addressing homelessness drew a standing-room-only crowd, Wutzke said.
“We celebrate all the citizens and diverse populations we have here,” Wutzke said. “People want engagement on issues that matter.”

Engagement is key to building connections and empathy that can lead to stronger communities, said Dalton Erickson, executive director of the North Dakota Human Rights Coalition, a statewide, member-based organization that has no direct connection to the Fargo group.
In a perfect world, local human rights groups would hold the local governments accountable, he said. They would ensure that all community members are heard and seen and able to exercise their human rights, he said.
“But local governments often don’t want to take on the tough civil rights issues like housing and accessible health care and federal over-reach,” Erickson said.
The loss of the Fargo Human Rights Commission should be concerning, Erickson said. But he’s also optimistic that a change after 25 years could provide some new ways of thinking and acting.
“They also could look at this as an opportunity to restructure and empower people,” Erickson said.

“I have to depart,” he said, adding that his community was “being terrorized.”
Piecing together information and constituent calls, he left the Omaha-Douglas County Civic Center that June 10 believing that at least two raids were happening. It turned out to be one. “So I have to go. I have to try and help.”
Garcia, a Douglas County Board member since 2021, provided updates about the Glenn Valley Foods worksite enforcement operation to the public using social media. The federal raid initially arrested roughly 80 alleged undocumented workers. He’s continued serving in a watchdog role in the ramp up of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity in the Omaha area.

A nominator called Garcia a “caring and courageous fighter and defender of social and political freedoms.”
“I know he will always show up, fight and stand up for what’s right and for what’s good, just like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.”
Two recipients are public servants. Among the honored was Lt. Antwone Finch of the Omaha Police Department, who, according to the statement, “gives back to the community that shaped him.” 
Born and raised in North Omaha, Finch is a longtime member of Omega Psi Phi Fraternity who has supported numerous charitable initiatives. With a focus on guiding youth, he has participated in Shop With a Cop, a program that annually connects kids from homeless shelters with Christmas gifts, and founded the “Before the Casket” gun violence prevention program.
The committee of county and city representatives that reviewed nominations also selected mixed martial artist Houston Alexander as the MLK community recipient — for his commitment to helping youth. 
In 2018, Alexander founded a foundation that provides free mentoring, education, fitness and cultural programs that promote positive lifestyles. The awards committee said Alexander’s “Culture Shock Tour” has reached more than 450 Nebraska schools, teaching the history of hip-hop while promoting self-expression, anti-bullying and nonviolent conflict resolution.

The three award winners were celebrated during an event Friday at the Omaha-Douglas County Civic Center that featured music and remarks, including from Mayor John Ewing Jr. and Omaha Human Rights and Relations Director Cailin Daly Dejillas.
Also in recognition of MLK, the Omaha Human Rights and Relations Department on Jan. 19 is hosting a “Living the Dream” eighth annual high school talent competition.
The 5:30 p.m. event at the Holland Performing Arts Center spotlights music, dance, social justice speeches and art by Omaha-area students in grades 7-12, and is free and open to the public.
Local and state government offices are closed Jan. 19 in recognition of the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday.

Lawyers for Attorney General Lynn Fitch and State Auditor Shad White will argue before the Mississippi Supreme Court on Tuesday over which of them has the right to claw back state money they believe was illegally spent.

Fitch believes she has the exclusive right to file a civil lawsuit on behalf of the state. White contends state law gives him the authority to file a suit to recoup funds in some instances.

The issue is over a section of Mississippi law stating that the state auditor is “to institute suit, and the attorney general shall prosecute the same in any court of the state,” when recovering misspent tax dollars.

Fitch first took White to court when the auditor attempted to sue Pro Football Hall of Fame athlete Brett Favre to recoup allegedly misspent welfare money. A Hinds County chancery judge disagreed with Fitch, so the attorney general appealed to the state’s highest court.

The two officials have said they’re considering running for governor and have clashed in recent years over the handling of Mississippi’s massive welfare scandal, which has seen multiple people plead guilty to state and federal crimes.
Fitch also withdrew her office’s representation of the auditor in two defamation lawsuits, including one filed by Favre, after determining a book White wrote about the welfare scandal cast her office in a negative light and created a conflict of interest.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/06073835/AP24037782705063-scaled.jpg,,,2026-01-19 06:57:16.821947

(Photo: Memphis Public Libraries)As Memphis pauses to honor Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, let us not forget that he gave his life in this city while standing with sanitation workers demanding dignity, respect, and a voice on the job.
Honoring Dr. King requires more than ceremony. It requires action.
Dr. King came to Memphis in 1968 because city workers were being denied basic rights and protections. He understood that economic justice is inseparable from racial justice and that workers must have the freedom to organize and bargain collectively in order to live with dignity. As he said, “The labor movement was the principal force that transformed misery and despair into hope and progress.”
More than 50 years later, many of us city workers here in Memphis are still fighting for that same dignity. Fifty years later and there is still so much work left to do.
We are Memphis library workers. Every day, we serve this city by keeping public libraries safe, welcoming spaces for learning, connection, and opportunity. We help students with homework, job seekers with applications, families with access to technology, and neighbors seeking information and support. Libraries are one of the few truly public spaces left in our city, and the people who staff them are essential public servants. 



People don’t come to the library just for the books—they come because of the library workers. Yet despite the vital role we play, Memphis library workers are denied the rights and protections afforded to other city employees. 


The work we do is hard but I wouldn’t trade it. At my library I’ve been able to give out lunches to kids, I’ve helped people apply for jobs and had them come back and tell me they got a job offer, I’ve had students in my fiber arts class begin to be able to teach the basics to newer attendees, and though sometimes I have to look a person in the eye and tell them we don’t have what they need, I have witnessed how quick a library worker is with an inventive solution. People don’t come to the library just for the books—they come because of the library workers.
Yet despite the vital role we play, library workers are denied the rights and protections afforded to other city employees.
Library workers are not classified as civil service employees. That means fewer job protections, less stability, and no guaranteed voice in decisions that affect our wages, staffing levels safety, or working conditions. On top of that, a 1984 executive order still denies many city workers the right to collectively bargain, silencing some of the very voices that keep Memphis running.
The consequences of these policies show up in understaffed libraries, high turnover, burnout and workers struggling to keep up with a rising cost of living. When workers lack protections and a meaningful voice, public services suffer, and so do the communities that rely on them.
This is not what Dr. King fought for. When he stood with sanitation workers in Memphis, he was clear that public workers deserved respect, fair treatment and the power to negotiate collectively. He believed unions and collective bargaining were essential tools for democracy and economic fairness, especially for Black and working-class workers.
Memphis, of all cities, should understand these basic rights.
That is why, on this MLK Day, we have two demands.
First, Memphis City Council must reclassify library workers as civil service employees. Civil service status would provide basic protections, fairness and stability for workers who dedicate their careers to serving the public. It would also strengthen our libraries by improving retention and morale, ensuring that Memphians can continue to rely on high-quality public services. 
Second, Mayor Paul Young must amend the 1984 executive order that denies city workers the right to collectively bargain. No worker should be silenced for wanting a seat at the table. Collective bargaining is not radical, it is a common-sense way for workers and city leadership to solve problems together. 
On January 27, library workers and supporters will be gathering at Memphis City Hall for a press conference before the third reading of the referendum to reclassify the library division as civil service. 
If Memphis truly wants to honor Dr. King, we must do more than remember his sacrifice. We must continue his work. That means respecting city workers, listening to their voices, and ensuring that those who serve the public have dignity and protections. Show that Memphis has learned from its past and is committed to a more just future for all.
Words alone do not preserve Dr. King’s legacy. Policies do.

Gillis is among the Perryman residents concerned by proposals from Constellation Energy for a new natural gas power plant close to the community. (Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)Since moving to her home in Harford County’s Perryman neighborhood in 2017, Tamie Wainwright has replaced her mailbox three times, after it was destroyed by traffic crashes.
She watches tractor trailers rush past at all hours of the day, heading toward nearby warehouses for companies like Wayfair and Sephora.
“It’s 24/7,” said Wainwright, a lifelong county resident.
And she’s seen pileups quickly trap traffic in her suburban neighborhood, which has only a few exits because it is bounded on one side by the Bush River and on the other by the sprawling military base at Aberdeen Proving Grounds.
“Our roads can’t handle it. My yard can’t handle it anymore,” Wainwright said.
It’s one reason a group of residents, called 3P Protect Perryman Peninsula, formed a public campaign to stop additional warehouse developments, promote infrastructure improvements and protect the local environment.

Now, they’re facing a new potential foe.
In November, Constellation Energy unveiled plans for a new natural gas-fired power plant in Perryman, on the same site as an existing plant that the company runs.
It’s not clear the proposal will advance. For one thing, Constellation has said that routing a new gas pipeline to the site could cost some $800 million, and the company is seeking financial help from an already cash-strapped state government. But the idea has stirred frustration in a small community already beset by industrial activity.
“For me, it was shock,” said Stacy Stone, who said her family has lived in the community for the last 50 years. “It was just shock that they would have such disrespect for our community after we’ve been vocal all this time.”
Constellation spokesman Paul Adams said the company “has a long history of operating safely and responsibly at our Perryman Generating Station in Aberdeen, Md., and that includes regularly engaging with community leaders and other stakeholders.”
“Nothing about that will change as we potentially develop additional natural gas and battery storage generating capacity at that location,” Adams wrote.
Constellation’s proposal came under a new state law that opened a “fast-track” permitting process for new energy generation in Maryland, a response to high electric bills.
The Public Service Commission determined last month that the company’s proposals —  a smaller 150-megawatt plant or a larger 564-megawatt facility — had met all of the legislature’s requirements to move through the fast-track, which would grant them a permit decision within 295 days after they file a complete application. That has yet to be filed.
Constellation’s proposal for 800 megawatts of battery storage on the Perryman site did not meet the fast-track requirements, but the company could still pursue it.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The state’s rush to bolster new power infrastructure could come into conflict with its own ambitious climate change mandates, which give Maryland until 2031 to reduce its globe-warming emissions 60% from 2006 levels. Achieving those reductions already presents a challenge. Building a new emissions-generating power plant would essentially render it impossible.
Meanwhile, residents worry about what a new power plant could mean for their health, the health of the river and the infrastructure of a neighborhood that they already consider overburdened by industry. They also worry that their concerns could fall by the wayside amid the expedited process.
“I’m not at all opposed to growth,” resident Glenn Gillis said. “You’ve got to do it with a sense of balance. And what we’ve seen here has been that the balance has been completely out of sync.”
‘They don’t know until it slaps them in the face’
In many ways, Perryman is a place where the urban and rural collide.
The drive in from bustling Route 40 passes a truck stop and a warehouse, but also grassy fields and the folksy Perryman Grocery — advertising cold cut sandwiches, beer and liquor.

To Glenn Dudderar, a 25-year neighborhood, that spot has come to represent the ways Perryman’s infrastructure isn’t keeping up with its rapid development into a Harford County shipping hub.
As cars, trucks and tractor trailers whizz past on two-lane Perryman Road,  Dudderar constantly notices pedestrians walking toward Perryman Grocery — the only shop within walking distance — without sidewalks or crosswalks to protect them.
As a former vice president of the Perryman Community Association, Dudderar says he pushed the county to build sidewalks along Perryman Road beginning in the early 2000s. Only recently has the idea seemed to gain momentum, though no construction has begun.
“We were going to bring trucks through that area,” Dudderar said. “And now we’re talking about a generation plant. We still haven’t solved the sidewalk problem.”
The neighborhood includes a mixture of riverfront homes small and large, but also a mobile home community and a series of squat three-story apartment buildings that include some low-income residents receiving government assistance.
“You have some very affluent people that live on the water there, but then you have some people that are living day-to-day,” said Del. Andre V. Johnson Jr. (D- Harford) who represents the area. “They’re working. They don’t know what’s really happening as far as these — whether it’s the Constellation [proposal], or whether it’s these warehouses — they don’t know until it slaps them in the face.”
Johnson says he isn’t necessarily opposed to the idea of another power plant in Perryman, but believes that residents ought to have plenty of say — starting with a public meeting in the community to air their concerns.
Constellation’s site, directly across the railroad tracks from many homes in Perryman, already includes a five-unit, 404-megawatt electric generation facility. Four of the units are oil-fueled combustion turbines, which can start quickly to supply the grid during times of peak demand. The fifth, added in 1995, is fueled by natural gas.
The Maryland Department of the Environment considers the area both overburdened by pollution and underserved, with high percentages of low-income, nonwhite and non-English-speaking individuals. The Perryman Census tract got an “environmental justice” score of 81.8 out of 100, placing it among the most-burdened tracts in the state.
Johnson argues that efforts to maintain agricultural lands in the northern portion of Harford County, while still encouraging development, has come at a cost to his more suburban district.

“In the upper end of the county, which they would consider to be God’s country, if they don’t want something, like solar or building a new gas plant … they’ll just shove it down into my district,” Johnson said. “And I don’t think that that’s right for my constituents.”
A resistance is born
Back in 2021, Perryman resident Leigh Maddox only found out about the warehouse proposal because of a small advertisement buried in a newspaper.
Developers were aiming to transform the corn fields near the entrance to the neighborhood into a sprawling freight terminal, complete with warehouses and thousands of parking spaces for cars and tractor trailers.
Perhaps best known for its locally canned white “shoe-peg” corn, Mitchell Farm had been operating since the 1800s. Wainwright can trace her family history back to ancestors who were enslaved on the farm.
For a community already surrounded by warehouses, train tracks and industrial sites, the proposal for the Mitchell site was a step too far.
“That galvanized us,” Gillis said.
In early 2022, residents formed 3P and began appearing in force at public meetings to oppose the project. Later, they would even file suit against the developers.
And they may have won that battle. In 2023, the Harford County Council amended zoning rules so that only 250,000 square feet of warehouse space could go on the property, a dramatic reduction from the 5 million square feet originally planned.
The next battlefront
The two plants proposed by Constellation would each generate about 1,000 pounds of globe-warming carbon dioxide per megawatt-hour, according to the company’s proposals.
But burning fossil fuels also means elevated concentrations of ground-level ozone and fine particulate matter, which can aggravate heart and lung disease, and lead to heart attacks, asthma attacks and strokes.

The proposals from Constellation also come as President Donald Trump’s (R) administration is proposing to roll back some air pollution rules for power plants.
“If this gets built at its current state of environmental protections, it appears more conscious to the community members, right? But I don’t think that that will necessarily stick around,” said Debbie Patton, a Perryman homeowner for the last 15 years. “That concerns me for my own personal health, for all of my neighbors’ health and all of the wildlife in this area.”
All the while, some experts aren’t convinced that new power generation even needs to be built in Maryland, including David Lapp, Maryland’s people’s counsel, who is charged with representing utility ratepayers.
Lapp said that a transmission line currently under construction by Baltimore Gas & Electric to address the retirement of the Brandon Shores and Wagner power plants in Anne Arundel County will solve congestion problems that forced Baltimore-area residents to pay more for power than others on the same electric grid.
“To build a power plant to serve the same purpose would be forcing ratepayers to double-pay for the same reliability benefit” Lapp said. “We can benefit from the generation that is built in the place where it is cheapest to build that generation, which may not be Maryland.”
That may be in Pennsylvania, home to substantial stores of natural gas, Lapp says.
It’s the prospect of pipeline construction, possibly from Pennsylvania, that truly worries Gunpowder Riverkeeper Theaux Le Gardeur, who also focuses on Perryman’s Bush River.
“The footprint of the gas plant is not the issue,” he said. “The issue is how the gas plant is fed.”
To build a pipeline, construction crews would have to clear foliage along the route. Even with some replanting, mature trees and other plant life would be lost, critical bulwarks against rushing rainwater that carries all the pollutants of human development, from lawn fertilizers to car exhaust fumes.

“The first thing that goes are the trees, and then the scrub wetlands go, and then we go back to, like, grass,” Le Gardeur said. “We’re losing that idea of forest and wetlands in providing natural stormwater controls.”
Controlling urban and suburban stormwater is among the greatest challenges facing the Chesapeake Bay. Stormwater pollution has increased since bay restoration efforts started in 1985, while pollution from other major sources, such as farm fields and sewage treatment plants, has declined.
Adams, of Constellation, said that “environmental and economic justice” is a “bedrock principle” for the company.
“Any new gas generation at our Perryman site would require significant new gas pipeline expansion. As Maryland policymakers consider proposals for new gas generation and related infrastructure, we encourage community members to take part in that conversation,” Adams wrote.
As he sat at his neighbor’s kitchen table among other community leaders during a recent meeting, Greg LaCour couldn’t help but gaze out the window toward the Bush River, which was dappled with ice.
And then, he saw them. A pair of bald eagles, soaring through the gray January sky. He interrupted the meeting to point them out.
“They’ve got a young one, and right now they’re teaching the young one how to fish,” LaCour said.
“I’m not kidding,” he said. “That’s part of our community.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DSC09894-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-19 08:58:20.177931

Deborah Fellela, a Johnston Democrat. Her bill aims to eliminate any potential surprises for customers. (Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Johnston Democratic Rep. Deborah Fellela wants businesses to be up-front about their surcharges for customers who pay with credit cards.  
Fellela’s bill, H7022, introduced Jan. 9 in the Rhode Island House of Representatives, would amend the state’s Unfair Sales Practices law to require businesses to clearly disclose any fees or surcharges that are added when customers pay by credit card.
Fellela wrote in a statement Friday morning that surcharges are “a popular option for small businesses who need to offset the costs of accepting those cards.” Merchants typically pay around 2% to 3% of a purchase when a customer pays with a credit card, and they can pay more on reward cards, which is why proprietors try to recoup these fees through surcharges. According to a March 2025 issue of the Nilson Report, in 2024 U.S. merchants paid $187.20 billion in fees to accept card payments for $11.902 trillion worth of goods and services.
“However, since those surcharges can vary from business to business, there is often confusion on the part of the consumer, who may not understand that these charges even exist,” Fellela wrote. “This bill would require an explanation that is clearly visible, rather than one that’s disguised by fine print.”
Surcharges passed on to customers are usually a comparable percentage to what the retailer pays. Card networks often cap the additional cost a merchant can charge, with Visa permitting a maximum of 3% while Mastercard maxes out at 4%.  
Under Fellela’s bill, which sports three other Democratic sponsors, surcharge notices would have to be posted in a conspicuous, clearly visible spot where customers pay for their purchases. At restaurants, the notice would have to be included on all menus. The surcharge amount or percentage would need to be included as well.
“Failure to provide the required notice shall be considered an unfair or deceptive trade practice and subject to enforcement under this chapter,” the legislation reads.
If the bill were to become law this legislative session, it would take effect Jan. 1, 2027.
Fellela’s bill now waits to be scheduled for a hearing in the House Committee on Corporations.
Similar legislation and guidelines have emerged in other states. Minnesota requires signage and oral notification of surcharges. A law passed in 2021 in Colorado caps surcharges at 2% and requires clear disclosure as well. And New York Governor Kathy Hochul instituted similar disclosure requirements in 2024.
A 2025 report by market research firm J.D. Power found that 34% of the 3,841 small businesses it surveyed said they added retail surcharges for credit-swiping customers. The same survey found that 41% of credit card users said they’ve decided not to use a card at a business because of a surcharge. Another J.D. Power survey from later in 2025 noted a drop in customer satisfaction when people are forced to pay a surcharge.    
Similarly, in a November 2025 survey by Lendingtree, 62% of cardholders reported they paid extra to use their credit card. About one-third said they weren’t aware of surcharges beforehand. Still, 46% of cardholders said they did not realize card networks made money off transactions.
Although some merchants will charge a fee for any card payment, debit cards are supposed to be exempt from surcharges. Both Visa and Mastercard have rules prohibiting surcharges on debit or prepaid cards, even if a customer opts to process their card as credit.

These photos are undated. (Louis Edward Nollau Nitrate Photographic Print Collection, University of Kentucky Libraries, Special Collections Research Center)When e-commerce billionaire Marc Lore announced his plans in 2021 to build a city called Telosa — a 150,000-acre metropolis for 5 million people, designed from scratch with autonomous vehicles, renewable energy, and a new economic model he calls “Equitism” — most observers imagined a desert setting. The architectural renderings from Bjarke Ingels Group showed gleaming towers rising from arid landscapes dotted with cacti and sagebrush.
But buried in the project’s early announcements was a surprise: Appalachia was listed as one of six potential locations, alongside Nevada, Utah, Idaho, Arizona and Texas. A two-decade Western drought that has lowered the Colorado River to emergency levels may well turn the planners to the mountains as the best alternative.
Marc Lore (LinkedIn)
By 2022, the Telosa team had narrowed their search to three western states. Yet the Appalachian option has never been formally ruled out, and the region continues to surface in discussions about the project. For those of us who have spent decades studying how outsiders have tried to remake the mountains — and how those efforts have fared — the prospect of an e-commerce billionaire dropping a futuristic city into the coalfields or another part of the region raises questions that go far deeper than site selection.
We have been here before. The mountains have served as a laboratory for planned communities, model towns and social engineering experiments for more than a century. From the company towns built by U.S. Steel to Eleanor Roosevelt’s beloved Arthurdale to the TVA’s showcase community at Norris, outsiders with grand visions have repeatedly seen Appalachia as a blank slate waiting to be filled with their dreams.
The results have been decidedly mixed. Before anyone plants Telosa in our hills, they should understand this history — and grapple with a fundamental question that has defined Appalachian development for generations: Who owns the land, and who gets to decide what happens on it?
What Lore wants to build
Lore made his fortune in e-commerce, not Silicon Valley tech. A native of Staten Island who grew up in New Jersey, he founded Jet.com (sold to Walmart for $3.3 billion) and Quidsi, parent company of Diapers.com (sold to Amazon for $545 million). After serving as Walmart’s e-commerce chief, he turned his attention to what he describes as reinventing how cities work.
The project has attracted notable supporters. Preet Bharara, the former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York and a childhood friend of Lore’s, has been actively involved in planning. At a 2022 town hall covered by Smart Cities Dive, Bharara spoke about the opportunity to build better civic institutions from scratch: “You don’t have to have a police department that has been marred by scandal and excessive use of force. You don’t have to have a local prison system like Rikers Island.” Danish architect Bjarke Ingels, whose firm designed Copenhagen’s innovative Copenhill waste-to-energy plant, serves as lead architect. Lore’s business partner Alex Rodriguez, the former baseball star with whom he purchased the Minnesota Timberwolves, has also been involved.
The Telosa project, named from the Greek word telos meaning “highest purpose,” promises to be “the most open, most fair and most inclusive city in the world.” The design calls for 36 mixed-use districts, each organized around the “15-minute city” concept where residents can reach work, schools, health care and recreation within a short walk or bike ride. Fossil-fuel vehicles would be banned. Renewable energy would power everything. Autonomous vehicles and even flying cars would move people and goods.
At the heart of the project is “Equitism,” Lore’s economic model based loosely on the ideas of 19th-century economist Henry George. Under this system, the land would be owned by a community foundation rather than individual property owners. As the city grows and land values rise, the foundation would capture that appreciation and use it to fund social services — health care, education, small business development — without burdening residents with high taxes.
“There’s a finite amount of land and that land was claimed generations ago,” Lore has written on the Telosa project website. “Land could essentially go from a barren piece of desert to a modern-day city worth billions, or even trillions. What if that land had been owned by a community endowment?”
It’s an intriguing question. But it’s not a new one in Appalachia.
Why Appalachia made the list
When Cardinal News editor Dwayne Yancey examined the Telosa proposal in 2021, he noted something that other commentators had missed: Despite all the desert imagery, the Appalachian region remained officially in play.
“Virtually all the news coverage of Telosa described it as a desert oasis,” Yancey wrote. “‘Former Walmart president reveals plan for $400 billion Utopian city in the US desert,’ headlined USA Today. And, sure enough, all the artists’ conceptions by the architectural firm show a desert backdrop with cacti and sagebrush. And yet … there’s still that sixth Appalachian option.”
Yancey explored what an Appalachian Telosa might mean for Southwest Virginia. The region, he noted, is “arguably underpopulated” — Buchanan County has lost nearly half its population since 1980, declining from 37,989 to around 20,000 today. “There’s plenty of room for more people.”
The practical advantages are considerable. Unlike the desert Southwest, Appalachia has abundant water — rivers, aquifers and reliable rainfall that could sustain a large population without the massive infrastructure investments required for desert living. Land costs are far lower than in the growth corridors of Nevada or Arizona. The region sits within reasonable distance of major metropolitan areas: Knoxville, Lexington, Roanoke and Charleston are all within a few hours’ drive.
But Yancey also raised the harder questions. A city of 50,000 — the initial phase of Telosa — would dwarf the existing population of most Appalachian localities. “That wouldn’t just change the culture of a county,” he observed. “It would create a new one. Is that desirable?”
That question cuts to the heart of Appalachian development debates that have raged for more than a century.
The company town model: Lynch, Kentucky

In 1917, U.S. Coal and Coke Company, a subsidiary of U.S. Steel, began building what would become the largest coal camp in the world on 19,000 acres in Harlan County. They named it Lynch, after company president Thomas Lynch.
By the 1940s, Lynch had a population of 10,000 and employed more than 4,000 workers. The company provided amenities that were remarkable for the time and place: quality housing built of local stone, a hospital, schools, a movie theater, churches, and recreational facilities. Housing was subsidized; no worker paid more than 25 percent of their salary for rent. The company store offered goods at competitive prices.
Lynch was considered one of the model coal camps in Appalachia because of its relatively high quality of life compared to the typical coal camp. The town attracted workers from across the globe — by 1926, it was described as “the new melting pot,” home to immigrants from Germany, Hungary, Austria, Serbia, Poland, Greece, Italy, Russia and dozens of other countries, alongside African Americans from the Deep South and local mountaineers. As historian William Turner documents in “The Harlan Renaissance,” the African American community in Lynch created a vibrant cultural life despite the constraints of segregation, building institutions that would shape generations.
But Lynch was also a closed community where the company controlled every aspect of political and economic life. U.S. Coal and Coke maintained its own police force, used not only to keep order but to intimidate workers who showed interest in unionization and to keep organizers out of town. The battles between coal operators and miners in Harlan County during this period earned the region the name “Bloody Harlan.”
When the company no longer needed Lynch, it simply walked away. U.S. Steel began tearing down buildings in the 1960s and sold what remained to residents. Today, Lynch has fewer than 700 people — a 93% decline from its peak. The rails that once carried millions of tons of coal to steel mills in Gary, Indiana, were abandoned in 1996.
The lesson of Lynch is sobering: Even a “model” company town serves the interests of its corporate owner first. When those interests change, the community is left to fend for itself with whatever infrastructure remains.
 TVA’s social laboratory: Norris, Tennessee

When Franklin Roosevelt appointed Arthur Morgan to chair the Tennessee Valley Authority in 1933, he got more than a flood-control engineer. Morgan had spent the previous decade as president of Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio, where he pioneered a cooperative education model combining work and study. He was a utopian who saw TVA as “little less than a means of reinventing civilization.” His grand vision went far beyond dams and power lines — he wanted to transform how people in the Tennessee Valley lived.
His fellow TVA director David Lilienthal would later call the agency “democracy on the march” — a phrase that carried considerable irony given that three appointed directors held total control over a seven-state utility with no meaningful accountability to the people whose lives they were transforming. What began as America’s boldest experiment in public planning would end up, as I wrote in American Heritage magazine in 1977, as the nation’s first flirtation with socialism that devolved into little more than a gigantic federally owned utility.
The human cost was staggering. TVA displaced approximately 125,000 people to create its dams and generating stations — families who had lived on that land for generations, removed with minimal compensation and little say in the matter. And the agency’s appetite for cheap electricity led directly to one of Appalachia’s greatest environmental catastrophes: TVA promoted and enabled the introduction of strip mining to Eastern Kentucky and the broader region, devastating mountaintops and hollows that had sustained communities for centuries.
Norris, Tennessee, was Morgan’s showcase. Built to house workers constructing Norris Dam, the town was designed as a permanent demonstration of cooperative living. Working with landscape architect Earle Draper, Morgan created a community that emphasized walkability, natural materials and communal facilities. Houses were modest but modern, built with native stone and cedar, each equipped with electric heating and refrigerators — luxuries in Depression-era Appalachia. A greenbelt of protected forest surrounded the residential areas.
Morgan dreamed that Norris would become economically self-sustaining through local industry — particularly ceramics, using native materials and traditional skills. It never worked out as he hoped. The ceramics venture failed, and Norris never developed an independent economic base.
More troubling was the town’s racial policy. TVA excluded Black families from Norris, claiming they were simply following local customs. Black leaders pointed out that this was false — the races had lived and worked together in the local mountains and valleys for generations. The policy was federal discrimination imposed on a region that, for all its problems, had more racial integration than the planned community that was supposed to represent the future.
Morgan clashed repeatedly with his fellow TVA directors over his ambitious social engineering and was fired by Roosevelt in 1938. The federal government sold Norris at auction in 1948; a Philadelphia consortium bought the entire town for just over $2 million and resold individual homes to residents.
Today, Norris survives as a pleasant bedroom community for Knoxville and Oak Ridge. Its design still wins admirers among urban planners. But Morgan’s dream of a self-sustaining model community that would “reinvent civilization” never materialized. Even TVA’s own institutional history acknowledges that Morgan “proved far more adept at technical engineering than at social engineering.”
Eleanor Roosevelt’s heartbreak: Arthurdale

No New Deal project was more personal to Eleanor Roosevelt than Arthurdale, a subsistence homestead community in Preston County, West Virginia.
In 1933, the first lady visited the Scotts Run mining camps near Morgantown and was devastated by what she found: families living in filthy, crowded housing without sanitation, children going hungry, a community hollowed out by the collapse of the coal industry. She threw herself into creating something better.
Arthurdale was the first of what would eventually be about 100 homestead communities built by the federal government during the Depression. The vision was to move struggling families out of failed industrial communities and onto small farms where they could achieve a measure of self-sufficiency while working in nearby industries.
On roughly 1,200 acres, the government built 165 homes with indoor plumbing, modern appliances and furniture — amenities that seemed miraculous to families coming from Scotts Run. An experimental school operated on progressive educational principles developed by John Dewey’s disciple Elsie Ripley Clapp. The community operated cooperatively, with residents working together to support the town.
Construction on the first 50 houses in Arthurdale started in 1933. The prefabricated homes were made by the E.F. Hodgson Company in New England. In keeping with the plan that Arthurdale be a self-sufficient farming community, each home came with a barn and hen and hog houses. The homes had a complete basement mostly used to preserve farm produce. The federal government additionally provided each house with electricity, indoor plumbing, refrigerators and coal-fired furnaces. (Arthurdale Heritage)
But Arthurdale struggled from the start. The government had difficulty attracting industry to the remote location — a problem that would doom many of the “stranded community” homesteads. Cost overruns drew fierce criticism in Congress. The selection process for residents was criticized as arbitrary and paternalistic, favoring applicants who “seem likely to welcome supervision and guidance from project administrators.”
Most damaging, the program required that applicants be white, native-born, Christian and part of a “standard nuclear family” — federal discrimination that excluded many of those most in need.
The federal government closed down Arthurdale in 1947, selling the land and buildings to private owners. The community survives today, with many original structures preserved in a museum complex. Historians still debate whether it was a noble experiment that failed for lack of sustained support, or a cautionary tale about the limits of social planning.
What’s beyond dispute is that the model didn’t scale. The subsistence homesteads that succeeded were those closest to cities with industrial employment. The isolated communities — the ones most like Appalachian coalfield towns — could not create self-sustaining economies.
Oak Ridge: The exception that proves the rule

If you want to see what unlimited federal resources and a singular mission can accomplish, look at Oak Ridge, Tennessee.
In 1942, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers forcibly purchased nearly 60,000 acres of farmland along the Clinch River, evicted about 4,000 residents, and built a secret city from scratch. Designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, Oak Ridge was intended to house workers for the Manhattan Project’s uranium enrichment facilities.
Original plans called for 13,000 residents. By war’s end, Oak Ridge was Tennessee’s fifth-largest city, with 75,000 people. The government built 300 miles of roads, 55 miles of railroad track, 10 schools, seven theaters, 17 restaurants and 13 supermarkets. A library, symphony orchestra and churches for 17 denominations served the community. Housing ranged from single-family homes to dormitories to the infamous “hutments” — one-room shacks assigned primarily to Black workers, who were segregated by race and generally relegated to lower-status jobs.

Oak Ridge succeeded as a production facility because it had what no other planned community in Appalachia has ever had: essentially unlimited funding (60% of the Manhattan Project’s $2 billion budget flowed through Oak Ridge), an existential national purpose, and total government control over every aspect of the operation.
When the war ended, Oak Ridge had to reinvent itself. The government retained control until the 1950s, then gradually opened the city. Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the Y-12 National Security Complex continue to operate, providing an economic anchor that most planned communities never achieve.
The lesson is not encouraging for Telosa’s prospects: Oak Ridge worked because the federal government was willing to spend virtually any amount of money to achieve a wartime objective. When the mission ended, the community survived because major federal facilities remained. No private-sector project, however well-funded, can replicate those conditions.
The central question: Who owns the land?
In 1973, I wrote in the Mountain Eagle of Whitesburg in Southeastern Kentucky: “If Appalachia is to survive, land reform is a must.” Fifty-two years later, I stand by that assessment.
The fundamental problem with every outside-imposed development scheme in Appalachia — whether company town, New Deal homestead or billionaire’s utopia — is that it leaves the basic structure of land ownership intact. The mountains have been owned by outside interests since the late 19th century, when land agents acquired vast holdings from families who didn’t understand what they were signing away. Coal and timber companies accumulated millions of acres, extracted the wealth, and left behind devastation.
Today, the situation is largely unchanged. A 2013 study by the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy found that six West Virginia counties have 50% or more of their land owned by just 25 landowners. Five of those six are in the southern coalfields. Not one of the state’s top 10 private landowners is headquartered in West Virginia.
After every flood, more families ask whether it makes sense to rebuild at the bottom of a hollow when idle corporate land sits unused on the ridgelines above. In Eastern Kentucky, a former strip mine on the Knott-Perry line is the planned site of the Olive Branch development. (Governor’s office)
Lore’s “Equitism” model at least grapples with land ownership — he proposes that a community foundation would own all the land and capture rising values for public benefit. But there’s a crucial difference between a foundation controlled by residents and one established by a billionaire who selects the initial governance structure.
A more promising model already exists in Appalachia, though it has never achieved the scale it deserves. In 1977, Marie Cirillo and her neighbors in the Clearfork Valley of northeastern Tennessee established the Woodland Community Land Trust. Working with land trust pioneers Robert Swann and Susan Witt, they created a structure where the community owns the land collectively and leases it to residents for housing, small business and agriculture.
The community land trust model keeps land affordable permanently through resale restrictions, prevents outside speculation and ensures that decisions about land use are made democratically by the people who live there. It’s the opposite of both the company town model and the billionaire-imposed utopia: Control flows from the bottom up, not the top down.
I’ve proposed a modern Homestead Act for Central Appalachia built on these principles. The plan would use existing legal frameworks — Virginia’s Land Bank Entities Act, federal brownfields protections, Appalachian Regional Commission programs — to acquire tax-delinquent and abandoned corporate land and redistribute it through community land trusts. Homesteaders would own their homes and improvements while the trust retains ownership of the underlying land, preventing speculation and ensuring permanent affordability.
This approach addresses what outside planners have consistently gotten wrong. It doesn’t try to “modernize the mountaineer” or impose someone else’s vision of the good life. It puts land and decision-making power in the hands of the people who will live with the consequences.
Would Telosa be different?
To be fair, Lore’s vision differs from the company towns and New Deal homesteads in important ways. He explicitly rejects the paternalism of corporate-controlled communities. The Telosa governance structure, as currently described, would involve resident participation in decision-making. The economic model, whatever its flaws, at least attempts to share rising land values with the community rather than concentrating them in private hands.
And the region could certainly use investment. The coalfields face projected population losses of 26% to 48% by 2050 according to university demographic studies. Schools and clinics are closing. Volunteer fire departments can’t replace aging equipment. After every flood, more families ask whether it makes sense to rebuild at the bottom of a hollow when idle corporate land sits unused on the ridgelines above.
A project that brought 50,000 new residents — let alone 5 million — would transform the economic calculus overnight. New tax base, new businesses, new opportunities for young people who currently see no future in the mountains.
But that transformation comes with risks that Telosa’s planners have not seriously addressed.
First, who would these new residents be? The Telosa vision seems oriented toward attracting outsiders rather than providing opportunities for current Appalachian residents. The project emphasizes high-tech employment, advanced education and “diverse” demographics — admirable goals, but ones that could easily result in displacement of existing communities rather than their revitalization.
Second, what happens when the billionaire’s interest wanes or the project falls short of its astronomical ambitions? Lynch declined because U.S. Steel no longer needed its coal. Arthurdale struggled because the federal government couldn’t sustain interest in an expensive experiment. The history of planned communities is littered with projects that thrived during their founders’ enthusiasm and collapsed afterward.
Third, who makes the decisions? Lore talks about resident participation, but the initial governance structure would be established by his team. The community land trust model puts democratic control first, from the very beginning. Equitism puts democratic participation second, after the foundation has been established on terms set by outside investors.
A different path

Central Appalachia stands at a genuine inflection point. The coal economy that defined the region for more than a century is ending. Climate change brings floods that devastate communities built in hollows and valleys. Population decline threatens the critical mass needed to sustain basic services.
The question is not whether change is coming — it’s who will control that change and who will benefit from it.
One path leads through outside control: billionaires with visions, corporations seeking opportunities, investors looking for returns. This path has been well-traveled in Appalachia, and the results speak for themselves. Even the best-intentioned outside interventions have foundered on the basic problem of absentee ownership and control.
Another path leads through community ownership and democratic decision-making. This path is harder — it requires building institutions from the ground up, developing local leadership and insisting that the people who live with the consequences have the primary voice in shaping the future. But it’s the path that has proven durable in places like the Clearfork Valley, where Woodland Community Land Trust has now operated for nearly half a century.
If Marc Lore is serious about building a community that embodies equity and sustainability, he could do worse than to study what Appalachians have already built for themselves. The community land trust model demonstrates that you don’t need a billionaire’s money to create lasting, affordable, democratically-controlled development. What you need is land that belongs to the people who live on it, and the freedom to shape their own future.
That’s not a lesson that translates easily to a $400 billion megaproject. But it might be the most important lesson the mountains have to teach.

Virginia Senate Democrats advance mid-decade redistricting amendment

Unlike two other civil rights-related constitutional amendments that passed with bipartisan support over the past year, Virginia’s reproductive rights measure has faced intense debate at every stage, with every Republican in the legislature opposing it. 
In defending her amendment for the final time, Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax, emphasized that advancing the proposal would ultimately leave the decision to voters across the state. 
Ranging from fertility treatments to contraception access to the ability to obtain an abortion, “this amendment protects families’ entire scope of reproductive needs,” she said. 
Boysko and several other Democratic lawmakers have described how women in states with abortion bans have died amid pregnancy complications. Those states have also seen an exodus of OB-GYN physicians amid uncertainty of treating patients who need abortions or miscarriage management.  
Boysko grew tearful as she recounted stories and advocacy shared by constituents and people around the state. 
Relatedly, Sen. Emily Jordan, R-Isle of Wight, struck a somber tone as she noted that “this is a difficult topic for a lot of people.”
On the opposite side of the chamber’s aisle — and in opposition to the amendment — Jordan unsuccessfully attempted to modify the proposal to explicitly spell out care for babies when born. 
A sticking point for some Republicans has been concern that the amendment could be interpreted to allow abortion up to the “moment of birth,”  though infanticide remains illegal under both state code and federal law. 
Sen. Tara Durant, R-Stafford, also attempted for the second legislative session in a row, to reiterate existing parental consent laws. Democrats and legal experts said it is unnecessary. Under Virginia law, minors are required to have parental or guardian consent for an abortion unless they petition a judge for authorization. 
On Thursday, Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, accused Republicans of employing delay tactics by pressing for their amendments to the amendment. 
“It is a delay tactic,” Sen. Mark Obenshain, R-Rockbridge, said on Friday, as he urged lawmakers to re-draft the amendment. Doing so, however, would restart the two-year process.
 A sense of urgency

While not entirely a partisan issue at the national level, the issue has increasingly fallen along party lines in states. That dynamic, Virginia Wesleyan University professor Leslie Caughell said, helps explain why Democrats are moving quickly while they hold legislative majorities. 
Though placing language in the Constitution is difficult, it is also harder to undo. With every other Southern state imposing deep restrictions or near-total bans, bolstering Virginia’s protections has become a priority for Democrats. Providers and abortion funds in Virginia have also seen a surge in out-of-state patients seeking care.
“I think everything that happened in North Carolina made activists on this really uncomfortable,” Caughell said. 
In 2023, a member of the neighboring state’s legislature switched from Democrat to Republican, giving the GOP a veto-proof majority and paving the way for enactment of North Carolina’s current 12-week abortion limit. 
In Virginia, Republicans have also put forward a range of abortion restrictions, from near-total bans to a 15-week cap that lacked exceptions for fetal anomalies — which are often not detected until around or after 15 weeks. 
On other reproductive health issues, a right-to-contraception bill has twice been vetoed by former Gov. Glenn Youngkin — a point Boysko reiterated as the amendment advanced last week. 
 ‘Yes’ and “No’ campaigns on the horizon

Reproductive rights groups in Virginia, along with physicians and volunteers, have coordinated as part the national Reproductive Freedom for All effort. Last year, a $5 million investment supported targeted initiatives ranging from canvassing to digital advertising in states such as Virginia, where Abigail Spanberger was elected governor.
Spanberger campaigned in part on supporting the amendment, though governors do not formally factor into its success or failure. 
“I look forward to spending ample time in advance of the 2026 elections campaigning to make sure that people understand the importance of this constitutional amendment,” she told The Mercury last summer. 
On the other side, SBA Pro-Life America supported Virginia-based anti-abortion groups last year through door-knocking efforts in key House of Delegates districts that were up for election. 
Democrats ultimately grew their majority by flipping additional seats. 
The abortion-opposing group “doesn’t have anything to share on the Virginia front at this time,” Communications Director Kelsey Pritchard said in an email, but the organization is monitoring Virginia among other states as it prepares to engage voters. 
Virginians for Reproductive Freedom — which includes organizations like Repro Rising and Planned Parenthood Advocates of Virginia —  will likely ramp up public engagement events and advertising as the November elections approach. 
Caughell said she is watching closely to see how Virginia’s constitutional amendment campaigns intersect with this year’s congressional midterm elections. 
The measures — which include redistricting, reproductive rights, same-sex marriage rights and voting rights — arrive at a moment when Democrats may have an advantage, she noted. 
Midterm elections are often a referendum on the party that controls the White House, Caughell said. 
With Republican President Donald Trump in the White House, GOP majorities in Congress, and federal funding fallouts affecting states, the amendments championed by Democrats could also help drive down-ballot votes. 
She also noted that abortion, as a distinct health care need, has become a more salient argument in recent years, alongside economic considerations and support for personal choice. 
“We’ve expanded the parameters of our understanding of who this issue directly affects,” Caughell said. 
Speaking with reporters outside the Senate chamber Friday, Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, emphasized that the work is not finished. 
“It’s our responsibility to go out there and tell the voters this is what this means and help everybody understand what they’re voting for,” she said.

(Photo by Nathan Howard/Getty Images)As Virginia grapples with an energy crisis fueled by the proliferation of data centers and growing local concern about permitting for the facilities, lawmakers are mulling how to manage the industry. 
Over the next two months of the General Assembly session, they will debate a slew of legislative proposals to streamline regulations, balance environmental priorities and address community concerns about the industry. 
A recent poll by the Chesapeake Climate Action Network found that three quarters of voters blame data centers for rising utility costs and 9 in 10 believe that lawmakers need to take action.
“There’s no option to do nothing,” said Del. Michelle Maldonado, D-Manassas, who represents the region of the state where most data centers are concentrated and who has put forward a measure that would have state regulators determine if ratepayers are being required to “unreasonably subsidize” data center transmission costs.
One of the challenges in regulating an industry like data centers is that Virginia holds local control in high regard. But with more counties giving approval to data centers to reap the rewards of increasing business and tax revenue, there is more pressure on the utilities to meet the power demands – the cost of which ultimately comes out of ratepayers’ pockets.
Lawmakers will debate how  the state can get the most out of the data center tax exemptions, expand on ratepayer protections following the new rate classes approved to the State Corporation Commission and get enough power on the grid to keep the lights on for everyone.
Here are the top data center bills of the 2026 legislative session so far. 
State Corporation Commission oversight
A controversial method of regulation Del. Josh Thomas, D-Prince William, is exploring through House Bill 155 looks to put additional reviews onto high load users over 25 megawatts, which describes most data centers and manufacturers. 
The SCC would examine if proposed data centers and other high-load companies made sufficient contracts with renewable energy production and storage or have proper demand response measures. The bill also requires the SCC to make sure there is enough energy and transmission capacity on the grid to support the new project. A similar bill did not make it through the legislative process in 2025.
Sen. Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, said in a press conference ahead of the legislative session that there are many ways to address the energy demands that data centers present. He pointed to a number of recommendations by the Commission on Electric Utility Regulation that are steps towards increased transparency and guardrails.
Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax, has filed HB906 to direct the SCC to form a work group tasked with finding ways to address energy load flexibility for the high load users. This is meant to help with grid strain and reliability and find other methods to ease grid demand. 
Recovery cost
The SCC recently approved a new rate class for high-load users under Dominion. They will now be locked into 14-year agreements and  minimum demand charges for these users would be 85% for transmission, 85% for distribution, and 60% for generation. Some environmental advocates believe it is a good first step in ensuring that data center companies are paying a fair share of the transmission and generation costs for power. 
Now lawmakers want to find more ways to relieve ratepayers from covering the cost of infrastructure that is primarily used by the data center industry.
Del. John McAuliff, D-Fauquier, has pitched HB 503, which would prevent utilities from putting the cost of transmission lines and energy generation that mostly serve data centers onto residential ratepayers. He hopes this will make the high load users chip in more for the infrastructure that is not providing power to homes and businesses.
“Right now the data centers are getting a pretty nice tax credit and we are paying for a lot of that infrastructure,” McAuliff said.
It’s in the same vein as Maldonado’s bill. She said that while the new rate class for high-load users will help keep rates fair, there is still concern about the cost recovery being added to bills through the individual riders. 
“Without this legislation, families and small businesses can still end up subsidizing the infrastructure, the line substations and transmission projects needed for data centers, even if data centers are in a new rate class,” Sen. Russet Perry, D-Loudoun, said in a press conference.
Water use, putting waste heat to use
Public questions about how much local water is being used by data centers have bubbled to the surface.
The servers inside of the warehouse-style buildings generate a lot of heat and need water to cool them down. Closed-loop hyperscale data centers are reported to use less water than the open loop systems. HB 589 by Del. Shelly Simonds, D-Newport News, would require water providers to report to the State Water Control Board monthly on the volume of water that the centers use.   
HB 496 by Del. Elizabeth Guzman, D-Prince William, would require data centers that are permitted by-right to report how much water the anticipated project would be using at the time of development. 
There are also some ideas on how to use the heat that is generated by the data centers. Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax, is bringing HB 323 to direct the Department of Energy to find ways to use the heat to either push it to surrounding buildings to the data centers as seen in other countries. 
Tax exemption requirements
Senate democrats said in a pre-session press conference the state misses out on an estimated $1 billion from the data center industry through tax exemptions. 
Surrovell said the state needs to benefit more from the industry utilizing the exemptions, either through potential energy efficiencies or other requirements. Sen. Creigh Deeds, D-Charlottesville, is expected to file a bill this session on that issue similar to his bill from last year that did not pass out of committee.
Environmental impacts
Thomas, the delegate representing Prince William, said his constituents told him that there needs to be a minimum standard for data center locations, sound profile, and other environmental concerns. In response, he filed HB 153, which would allow localities to require high energy users to complete a site assessment when they apply for permits for proposed projects. 
Thomas said this would be a way for county boards to get the full picture of how data centers or other projects may impact the surrounding community. 
“We can look in some localities like my own in Prince William County, where there are clear mistakes in siting. The Village Place Technology Park is a clear example, right next to the Village Place housing development that was there first,” Thomas said. “One vote ends up putting an industrial site way too close,” Thomas said, adding that one could throw a baseball from one of the homes’ back decks and hit the nearby data center. “And so that’s clearly inappropriate.”
A similar bill was vetoed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin last year. At the time, the governor said it would create too much red tape for the industry.
There have been growing worries over the emissions from data centers’ diesel backup generators. Usually, they only run for a few minutes a month to test them unless there is an emergency situation. As the regional transmission managed by PJM is strained during hot and cold days – the grid operator is exploring whether data centers should hop off the grid to relieve some of the pressure. But that means the generators would run for hours at a time – releasing fumes into surrounding neighborhoods. 
Thomas’ HB 154 would require the facility to report publicly when the use of the emergency generators will be in use.
“I find that very dangerous and concerning for those of us that have high concentrations of data centers near our children and near our schools. So all the bill does is create more transparency,” Thomas said.
Senate Bill 130, HB 607 and HB 507 also zoom in on the diesel backup generators, offering limitations on how much they can be used and pushing the industry towards energy storage options as their backup method of power. 
Many lawmakers believe it will take more than one session to work out the regulations around the multi-billion dollar industry. 
“It’s probably going to take a year, or two, or three to fully flesh out because there’s billions and billions and billions of dollars of assets and land investment out there, and we have to make sure we’re prudent about how we do it. But there’s no question, (the data center industry) is part of the problem, and we have to take it head on,” Surovell said.

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/ Virginia Mercury) I’ve watched every Virginia governor’s inauguration for the past 30 years. For most of those, I covered them on-site as a reporter or editor. They’ve ranged from perfectly serviceable to pretty doggone good.
But what Abigail Davis Spanberger did Saturday in the first minutes of her term as governor soared past them all.
Spanberger sworn in as Virginia’s first woman governor, moves swiftly to set agenda

Not since the inauguration of L. Douglas Wilder as the nation’s first elected Black governor 36 years ago has the day been as heavily freighted with history as it was for Spanberger — the first woman to govern Virginia in more than four centuries as a colony or a commonwealth. Never had Virginians heard their leader speak as a daughter, a wife, a sister, a mother.
In content, tone and delivery, she comfortably and confidently rendered an address for the ages — one that rose to the importance of the occasion, rich in lines that will be quoted for generations to come.
For Virginians, it blended the sweet optimism of President Ronald Reagan’s “Shining city on a hill” valedictory and President John Kennedy’s stirring “Ask not” exhortation to Americans’ collective and individual commitment to country.
Under leaden skies against a damp winter chill, her sunny 25-minute address took in the vast sweep of Virginia’s history — for better and for worse — and paired it seamlessly to today’s divisive strife and tomorrow’s daunting challenges for her and her government.
She noted the commonwealth’s first two governors, Patrick Henry and Thomas Jefferson, and cited Henry’s 1799 admonition in his final public speech — “United we stand, divided we fall” — that is as urgent now as it was at our republic’s birth.
Dressed in suffragette white and standing as the ultimate triumph of their cause, Spanberger saluted women who risked harassment and arrest on the same Capitol steps a century earlier advocating for women’s right to vote.
On the eve of the holiday celebrating the Rev. Martin Luther King’s birthday, she noted King’s daring 1960 speech in Richmond urging Gov. Lindsay Almond to end Massive Resistance, Virginia’s disgraceful and futile effort to defy the Supreme Court’s 1954 ruling to desegregate public schools.
In attendance on his 95th birthday, Spanberger recognized Wilder, descended from enslaved grandparents, whose 1990 inauguration packed Capitol Square — a realization of King’s dream.

And she honored the memory of Linwood Holton, Virginia’s first Republican governor, who served notice in his 1970 inaugural speech that Virginia would, at last, embrace racial equality, not just as the law but as a value. Seated nearby, Holton’s daughter, former First Lady Anne Holton, fought back tears as her husband, U.S. Sen and former Gov. Tim Kaine, comforted her.
When she shifted to the present, Spanberger confronted the administration of President Donald Trump and the “recklessness coming out of Washington” without once uttering his name. She addressed Virginians’ concerns head on.
“You are worried about policies that are hurting our communities, cutting health care access, imperiling rural hospitals, and driving up costs,” she said. Affordability was the centerpiece of her campaign and is now the focus of her term.
“You are worried about Washington policies that are closing off markets, hurting innovation and private industry, and attacking those who have devoted their lives to public service,” she said, referring to Trump’s schedule of punitive tariffs and federal job cuts in a state that is home to 330,000 federal government workers.
“You are worried about an administration that is gilding buildings while schools crumble, breaking the social safety net and sowing fear across our communities, betraying the values of who we are as Americans, the very values that we celebrate here on these steps,” she said. No elaboration is necessary.
Then she spoke without equivocation to the dispute roiling the nation, causing massive midwinter protests in cities across America, knowing her words might escalate the vindictive president’s reprisals. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were spotted operating last week in Petersburg and Henrico County.
“And in Virginia,” Spanberger said, “our hard-working, law-abiding immigrant neighbors will know that when we say that we will focus on the security and safety of all of our neighbors, we mean them, too.”
Does such a powerful oratorical start presage a successful term? Oh, were it so easy.
She has staked out an ambitious agenda, and she’s got 1,454 days and nights to achieve it. Many will be difficult, frustrating and thankless. There are unknown crises that, as often as not, hijack a governor’s term and define his — now her — legacy.
But at least for the moment, Abigail Spanberger has pointed Virginia toward a new destination, and she has inspired us to follow her there.

(Photo by Klaus Vedfelt/Getty Images) Less than a year after it was enacted, lawmakers will revisit a proposal that brought major changes to Virginia’s K-12 public school testing system, with the main debate centering on whether to keep or repeal a provision passed last year that requires assessments to count for 10% of students’ final grades.
Overhauling the testing system aims to raise student performance, strengthen outcomes and make the Standards of Learning (SOL) assessments in core subjects (math, reading, history and social science) more meaningful. 
The changes made to SOL testing to tie test scores to final grades, shift test timing, and give parents clearer results garnered widespread support in the General Assembly. However, some lawmakers, like Del. Kelly Convirs-Fowler, D-Virginia Beach, who opposed certain portions, argued the education community did not entirely support the revamp.
“Overall, it is meant to be an assessment of how these SOLs are being taught, if it’s working, and so it shouldn’t be a part of their grade,” said Convirs-Fowler, a retired educator, last week.
She added that “Standards of Learning are standards and the testing is what we’re using to assess that we’ve done what we’re supposed to do … and if we do that, then that’s the goal.”
Last year, the legislation carried by Del. Dan Helmer, D-Fairfax, and Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico, took different measures to improve how the SOLs are administered and used to evaluate what students should know at the end of each grade or course. 
VanValkenburg, a History and US Government teacher at Glen Allen High School, said he is aware of the Convirs-Fowler’s view, but had not spoken to her at the start of the session. He said the provision was intended to alleviate end-of-year testing and improve testing.
He said the primary goal is to reduce overtesting by replacing separate teacher-led finals with standardized end-of-course exams, ensuring students face only one major cumulative test. 
VanValkenburg said adding these scores to the final grades motivates students and gives them a clearer reason to take the exams seriously. He also said this provision reduces the burden on educators. Currently, teachers lose weeks of instructional time to repeated testing cycles.
“As a teacher, it’s incredibly frustrating when the last five weeks of your school year are bogged down in repeated final exams,” VanValkenburg said. “It doesn’t make any sense to me.”
State Department of Education data showed modest gains in 2023-2024 reading and math pass rates. These gains followed targeted recovery efforts led by Gov. Glenn Youngkin and the General Assembly. Performance in other subjects stayed below 2022-2023 levels.
Convirs-Fowler was one of the few who voted against the legislation. This year, she is carrying House Bill 189, which aims to repeal a law requiring students in grades 7-12 to have at least 10% of their final grade in a course determined by their SOL or local alternative assessment scores.
Virginia recently overhauled its accountability system, splitting its accreditation model into two systems: one to determine whether schools meet legal and regulatory requirements, and another to provide clear data on student and school performance.
Scott Brabrand, executive director of the Virginia Association of School Superintendents, said that with revisions to the state’s accountability system, Virginia now has multiple ways to track accountability without having to make the SOLs count for 10% of the student’s final grade.
“The Standards of Learning are an important part of accountability, but they’re not the only part of accountability, especially in this new performance and support framework,” Brabrand said. “Additionally, SOLs are tied to a student’s graduation. Students have to get a certain number of verified credits to pass the SOLs. So really, this 10% final grade is adding an additional layer of accountability that really isn’t necessary.”
The future of Convirs-Fowler’s bill is uncertain, as Helmer and VanValkenburg have filed companion bills to refine their previous legislation. These changes focus on grading integrity, student eligibility for alternate assessments, test timing, and the public release of assessment materials.
Some of the highlights of the proposal include adding specific exemptions for students with significant cognitive disabilities and clarifying that parents and teachers are part of the team that decides whether a student should use an alternate test. 
Exceptions to the test timing were added for high school seniors in the final semester, students retaking tests and student transfers.
National exams, such as Advanced Placement (AP), International Baccalaureate (IB), and College Level Examination Program (CLEP), would be exempt from the general limit of one assessment per academic quarter under the measure. 
The proposal would allow school boards to request a case-by-case exemption to give a standard SOL test to an individual student, even if the rest of the class is taking a local alternative assessment, provided that the exemption does not exceed five percent of the students in that subject. 
To protect the security of future exams, the proposal allows the board to release representative sample questions instead of a full past exam, if releasing the full exam would leave less than 70% of the question bank available. 
Changes to the legislation are likely to affect the Board of Education’s efforts to revise how the state measures students’ performance in history and social science in the state’s Consolidated State Plan. 
Social studies leaders have advocated for flexible, performance-based local assessments that allow educators to measure student learning in meaningful, varied ways while maintaining alignment with state standards. Such assessments balance accountability with recognition that students learn and demonstrate knowledge differently.
The proposed legislation would add safeguards for both mandatory and permissive local alternative assessments, including requiring permissive assessments to be graded in alignment with the “best practices” established by the Board of Education, which are slated to be made available to schools by Sept. 1, 2026.
The proposal also creates stricter rules for grading local alternative assessments, such as preventing teachers from grading their own students’ work and ensuring students have no prior access to the test prompts.
There are other bills that might impact testing on the docket. A measure being carried by Sen. David Suetterlein, R-Roanoke County, and Del. Sam Rasoul, D-Roanoke, would give Virginia school districts more time and flexibility in how they test students.
Currently, the commonwealth is rolling out a new testing system that measures student growth throughout the year. Sutterlein and Rasoul’s bill would allow schools to fully switch to the new system and continue using alternative tests until the 2027-2028 school year.
Under House Bill 1243 sponsored by Del. Israel O’Quinn, R-Washington, if a student fails an SOL test but quickly retakes it and passes, the school would count only the passing retake score when the student’s performance and the school’s overall rating and accreditation are considered.
Currently, a failing score can impact a school’s rating.

(Photo by Nathan King/ National Park Service)Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s words from his “Beyond Vietnam” speech still ring true.
“When machines and computers, profit motives, and property rights are considered more important than people,” he warned, “the giant triplets of racism, extreme materialism, and militarism are incapable of being conquered.”
Those words, delivered in 1967, still summarize today’s political moment. Instead of putting the lives of working Americans first, our leaders in Congress and the White House have prioritized advancing corporate profits and wealth concentration, slashing government programs meant to advance upward mobility, and deploying military forces across the country, increasing distrust and tension.
This historic regression corresponds with a recessionary environment for Black America in particular. That’s what my organization, the Joint Center, found in our report, “State of the Dream 2026: From Regression to Signs of a Black Recession.”
The economic landscape for Black Americans in 2026 is troubling, with unemployment rates signaling a potential recession. By December 2025, Black unemployment had reached 7.5 percent — a stark contrast to the national rate of 4.4 percent. This disparity highlights the persistent economic inequalities faced by Black communities, which have only been exacerbated by policy shifts that have weakened the labor market. The volatility in Black youth unemployment, which fluctuated dramatically in the latter months of 2025, underscores the precariousness of the situation.
The Trump administration’s executive orders have systematically dismantled structures aimed at promoting racial equality. By targeting programs such as Lyndon Johnson’s 1965 Equal Employment Opportunity executive order and defunding agencies like the Minority Business Development Agency, the administration has shifted federal support away from disadvantaged businesses.
As a result, Black-owned firms risk losing contracts and resources tied to federal programs, potentially resulting in job losses and reduced economic growth. These changes threaten billions in federal revenue for Black-owned firms and undermine efforts to move beyond racial inequality in the workforce.
The GOP’s so-called “Big Beautiful Bill,” passed in 2025, further entrenches inequality by providing tax cuts that disproportionately benefit high-income households and corporations — while simultaneously slashing investments in programs like Medicaid and SNAP, limiting access to essential services for low-income households.
The technology sector, a critical component of the American economy, is also affected by this disregard for civil rights. Executive orders like “Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence” have stripped away protections that could advance inclusion in this rapidly growing field. As a result, the future of the American economy risks reinforcing past inequalities.
Dr. King’s call for strong, aggressive federal leadership in addressing racial inequality remains highly relevant. However, instead of eradicating structures of inequality, our current leadership is implementing policies that destroy government jobs and dismantle agencies responsible for preventing predatory economic practices. These choices undermine longstanding efforts to combat racial and economic disparities — and exemplify the regressive economic policies that coincide with rising Black unemployment.
As Dr. King stated, “we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt.” But urgent action is required. Unless we act deliberately, economic and racial inequalities will become entrenched, resulting in generational loss. The core question is whether we will move beyond our nation’s history of racism, materialism, and militarism, and — as Dr. King urged — embrace “the fierce urgency now” to advance equity.

When one of Adam Burkhammer’s foster children struggled with hyperactivity, the West Virginia legislator and his wife decided to alter their diet and remove any foods that contained synthetic dyes.
“We saw a turnaround in his behavior, and our other children,” said Burkhammer, who has adopted or fostered 10 kids with his wife. “There are real impacts on real kids.”
The Republican turned his experience into legislation, sponsoring a bill to ban seven dyes from food sold in the state. It became law in March, making West Virginia the first state to institute such a ban from all food products.
The bill was among a slew of state efforts to regulate synthetic dyes. In 2025, roughly 75 bills aimed at food dyes were introduced in 37 states, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
Chemical dyes and nutrition are just part of the broader “Make America Healthy Again” agenda. Promoted by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., MAHA ideas have made their deepest inroads at the state level, with strong support from Republicans — and in some places, from Democrats. The $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program — created last year as part of the GOP’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act to expand health care access in rural areas — offers incentives to states that implement MAHA policies.
Federal and state officials are seeking a broad swath of health policy changes, including rolling back routine vaccinations and expanding the use of drugs such as ivermectin for treatments beyond their approved use. State lawmakers have introduced dozens of bills targeting vaccines, fluoridated water and PFAS, a group of compounds known as “forever chemicals” that have been linked to cancer and other health problems.
As Republicans spar over IVF, some turn to obscure MAHA-backed alternative

In addition to West Virginia, six other states have targeted food dyes with new laws or executive orders, requiring warning labels on food with certain dyes or banning the sale of such products in schools. California has had a law regulating food dyes since 2023.
Most synthetic dyes used to color food have been around for decades. Some clinical studies have found a link between their use and hyperactivity in children. And in early 2025, in the last days of President Joe Biden’s term, the Food and Drug Administration outlawed the use of a dye known as Red No. 3.
Major food companies including Nestle, Hershey  and PepsiCo have gotten on board, pledging to eliminate at least some color additives from food products over the next year or two.
“We anticipate that the momentum we saw in 2025 will continue into 2026, with a particular focus on ingredient safety and transparency,” said John Hewitt, the senior vice president of state affairs for the Consumer Brands Association, a trade group for food manufacturers.
This past summer, the group called on its members to voluntarily eliminate federally certified artificial dyes from their products by the end of 2027.
“The state laws are really what’s motivating companies to get rid of dyes,” said Jensen Jose, regulatory counsel for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nonprofit health advocacy group.
Andy Baker-White, the senior director of state health policy for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, said the bipartisan support for bills targeting food dyes and ultraprocessed food struck him as unusual. Several red states have proposed legislation modeled on California’s 2023 law, which bans four food additives.
“It’s not very often you see states like California and West Virginia at the forefront of an issue together,” Baker-White said.
State lawmakers embrace RFK Jr.’s health policies

Although Democrats have joined Republicans in some of these efforts, Kennedy continues to drive the agenda. He appeared with Texas officials when the state enacted a package of food-related laws, including one that bars individuals who participate in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — SNAP or food stamps — from using their benefits to buy candy or sugary drinks. In December, the U.S. Department of Agriculture approved similar waivers sought by six states. Eighteen states will block SNAP purchases of those items in 2026.
There are bound to be more. The Rural Health Transformation Program also offers incentives to states that implemented restrictions on SNAP.
“There are real and concrete effects where the rural health money gives points for changes in SNAP eligibility or the SNAP definitions,” Baker-White said.
In October, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill that sets a legal definition for ultraprocessed foods and will phase them out of schools. It’s a move that may be copied in other states in 2026, while also providing fodder for legal battles. In December, San Francisco City Attorney David Chiu sued major food companies, accusing them of selling “harmful and addictive” products. The lawsuit names specific brands — including cereals, pizzas, sodas and potato chips — linking them to serious health problems.
Kennedy has also blamed ultraprocessed foods for chronic diseases. But even proponents of the efforts to tackle nutrition concerns don’t agree on which foods to target. MAHA adherents on the right haven’t focused on sugar and sodium as much as policymakers on the left. The parties have also butted heads over some Republicans’ championing of raw milk, which can spread harmful germs, and the consumption of saturated fat, which contributes to heart disease.
Policymakers expect other flash points. Moves by the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that are making vaccine access more difficult have led blue states to find ways to set their own standards apart from federal recommendations, with 15 Democratic governors announcing a new public health alliance in October. Meanwhile, more red states may eliminate vaccine mandates for employees; Idaho made them illegal. And Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is pushing to eliminate school vaccine mandates.
Even as Kennedy advocates eliminating artificial dyes, the Environmental Protection Agency has loosened restrictions on chemicals and pesticides, leading MAHA activists to circulate an online petition calling on President Donald Trump to fire EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.
Congress has yet to act on most MAHA proposals. But state lawmakers are poised to tackle many of them.
“If we’re honest, the American people have lost faith in some of our federal institutions, whether FDA or CDC,” said Burkhammer, the West Virginia lawmaker. “We’re going to step up as states and do the right thing.”

Republish photo only with original story.)A federal judge in the Southern District of Ohio issued a preliminary injunction in favor of the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio in a lawsuit challenging Ohio State University’s decision to expel a student who posted videos on social media about the Israel-Palestine conflict. 
Ohio State disenrolled Guy Christensen without a hearing in May and on Wednesday U.S. District Court Judge Edmund Sargus, Jr. of the Southern District of Ohio ordered Ohio State to expunge “any mention of involuntary disenrollment” from Christensen’s academic transcript, according to the lawsuit. ACLU of Ohio filed the lawsuit in September and the case remains open.

“The Court concludes that Mr. Christensen has demonstrated a strong likelihood of success on the merits of his First Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment claims,” according to the lawsuit. 
Christensen is a pro-Palestinian social media influencer with more than 3 million TikTok followers. He finished his freshman year at Ohio State in April. 
His social media videos attracted attention back in May when, in response to two Israeli embassy staff members being killed in Washington, D.C., Christensen urged his followers to “support” Elias Rodriguez, the accused killer, in a video that has since been taken down. Christensen originally condemned the killings, but took back his condemnation. 
In another video around that time, Christensen condemned U.S. Congressman Ritchie Torres, D-NY, for his “support for Zionism and associations with pro-Israel political entities,” according to the lawsuit. Torres then urged the U.S. Capitol Police to investigate Christensen and the alleged threats he made. That video has also since been taken down. 
Christensen claimed Ohio State “violated his First Amendment right to free speech by expelling him for engaging in protected political speech and his Fourteenth Amendment right to due process by expelling him summarily, without an opportunity to be heard,” according to the lawsuit.
The court held a hearing on Christensen’s motion for preliminary injunction on Monday and Christensen argued both videos are political speech protected by the First Amendment, according to the lawsuit. 
Sargus found the videos “did not explicitly encourage violence or lawlessness and are unlikely to be an implicit endorsement of such action … there is no evidence that violence or lawlessness occurred as a result of Mr. Christensen’s speech,” according to the lawsuit. 
The court also found no evidence to suggest Christensen’s video disrupted any classes, according to the lawsuit. 
When it comes to due process, the court found Christensen received notice of his disenrollment at the same time the disenrollment took effect on May 30 — meaning he did not have an opportunity to be heard before his dismissal, according to the lawsuit. 
“We’re disappointed in the ruling,” Ohio State spokesperson Ben Johnson said in an email. 
ACLU of Ohio Managing Legal Director David Carey said the ruling underscores a foundation concept of the U.S. Constitution. 
“Political opinions may not be silenced or punished merely because they may give offense,” Carey said in a statement. “We applaud the court’s ruling not only for its vindication of a student’s right to free expression, but also as a critical reminder to our institutions of higher education.”

(Photo by Molly Rains/New Hampshire Bulletin)Friday was bright and bitter at the foot of Mount Washington. The sun was shining, but howling wind dropped the feels-like temperature well below zero and whipped up a sharp spray of ice from the forest floor. At higher elevations, snow was flying as wind gusts clocked in at 50 to 100 miles per hour. 
These conditions can be perilous, but for some, and with careful precautions, they’re also a coveted treat. But for all the joy the outdoors can offer, the ability to feel safe and comfortable in the wilderness can be elusive. That’s one reason Hannah Kothari said she had convened a group of nearly 20 other women at Pinkham Notch on Jan. 16 — and why, through her rapidly growing club, Kothari has dedicated much of her free time over the past several months to bringing groups of women out into the wilderness of New Hampshire, Maine, and Vermont.
“It’s been very empowering for me to be outside with other women for the first time, really, in my life,” said Kothari, who founded her club, Chicks on Cliffs, in November. Her mission, she said, is to create the safe, empowering, and beginner-friendly community she had wished for during her own introduction to outdoor recreation.
“I feel like I can finally kind of pay it forward,” she said, “and be the person I wish I had when I was starting out.”

The Instagram account for Chicks on Cliffs has already grown to nearly 6,000 followers. Through it, Kothari, a college senior, marshals groups of women and a network of trip leaders on excursions in the White Mountains and beyond nearly every weekend. But the endeavor, she said, started humbly, and not very long ago.
Early in her college career, after years of struggling to keep up with her peers despite her active lifestyle, doctors discovered that one of Kothari’s heart valves was leaking. The realization explained why strenuous activities felt difficult, and made many of Kothari’s past experiences suddenly make sense, she said, like falling behind during group activities and hikes — and the frustration, disappointment, and even embarrassment she felt at those times.
At first, doctors told Kothari there was nothing to be done. But reading a nursing textbook over a friend’s shoulder, Kothari learned that certain kinds of birth control, including the one she took, could significantly worsen heart valve problems. Inspired, Kothari switched her prescription, and almost immediately her ability to exercise was transformed.
Kothari immediately took to the trails, logging more than 100 miles on hikes between October and December 2025. She was mostly hiking alone, and posting about her adventures on social media. Soon, her posts were resonating with other women.
“All these girls started reaching out to me, asking me questions,” Kothari said, about things like feeling safe hiking alone as a woman and traveling solo in the backcountry. Kothari gladly answered them, and soon, online connections turned into real-world hiking meetups; then, Chicks on Cliffs was born.

The first official Chicks on Cliffs meetup had two attendees, in addition to Kothari, she said. But lately, trips have been fully booked.
The communities around hiking and skiing can be hard to break into, and sometimes feel gatekept or male dominated, Kothari said. Chicks on Cliffs, she hopes, can serve as an antidote to that, allowing women to share knowledge and tips in a judgment-free environment. 
Kothari takes pride in sharing the knowledge she’s gained over the course of her own introduction to outdoor exploration, which was largely self-taught and trial-and-error, she said. Armed with extra layers, snacks, water, and a first aid kit, she hopes to teach newcomers about safety in the outdoors while empowering them to eventually feel comfortable outside on their own.
Kothari carries her own experience being frustrated, and feeling like the outdoors weren’t a place for her, in her role as trip leader, she said. 
The goal, she said, is to take “that experience of feeling that way, and giving that to others, and helping other people through that. … Being patient, and being kind, and being everything that I wish I would have had in those moments earlier in my academic career.”

Most Chicks on Cliffs gatherings take the form of hikes or casual ski meetups, Kothari said. But Jan. 16 was different, featuring an introductory course on safety in the backcountry. The course was led by two avalanche experts: Caitlin Kelly and Ashley Murray of East Coast Avalanche Education, which partnered with Chicks on Cliffs to offer the course. 
Some in attendance said they’d been to other Chicks on Cliffs meetups before; others were joining for the first time. All were glad to have a welcoming group in which they could lean into the experience of being a backcountry beginner.
“My only friends that backcountry ski are a group of guys that have been doing it for a while. It kind of felt intimidating to go with them and be kind of left in the dust, or rely on them to teach me,” said Maddie Castle, who drove from Maine to Pinkham Notch Friday to attend the Chicks on Cliffs meetup. 
There was something “automatically comfortable” about a group like Chicks on Cliffs, where everyone comes as they are, said attendee Caroline Eaton.
Kothari said she was thrilled to offer a place for women to try new things and experience the joy of the outdoors together. In the future, she hopes to continue growing the club, and offer a wider range of activities to capture people at more levels of experience and comfort.
“Everybody is on their own journey, and I really want to support folks in whatever phase of that journey they may be on,” she said.

Phil Plummer, R-Dayton, speaks during a Jan. 15, 2026, press conference on new legislation to increase investigative authority in the state on child care fraud.
Screenshot courtesy of The Ohio ChannelOhio lawmakers are joining the defense for the state’s child care oversight system, while also pledging to improve it with new legislation.
State Reps. Phil Plummer, R-Dayton, and Tom Young, R-Washington Twp., emphasized the strength of Ohio’s verification and investigative process when it comes to child care facilities in a press conference where they also announced a new bill to increase the investigative power available to state authorities.
Ohio House Bill 647 would give the Ohio Attorney General’s Office the authority to investigate “any publicly funded child care program suspected of fraud.”
The Ohio Department of Children and Youth, which leads oversight of licensed child care providers and currently investigates allegations, would be allowed to immediately suspend the license and provider agreement for a facility “under the suspicion of fraud.”
The sponsors of the bill also promoted money the bill would allow to go to “enhanced data analytics” for attendance reviews. Young said the bill would include $5 million in appropriations over the next two years.
Following the allegations of child care fraud in Minnesota originated by a right-wing social media influencer and taken up by the Trump administration, states like Ohio have felt the need to respond to public questions, and were told by federal leaders that they would need to prove the federal money for Publicly Funded Child Care was being used properly.
Plummer said the bill is not only an effort to maintain an already strong system, but also a response to public opinions that the child care system in Ohio is in need of more scrutiny.
“We can’t gaslight this and freak out the federal administration, and they pull our funding,” Plummer said. “Because then we lose child care centers.”
As a parent of children who have benefitted from Ohio’s child care system, Young said he’s glad to see facility workers keeping members of the public attempting to do their own investigations out of child care buildings. He said it further proves the protections at work in the sector.
“There’s no way, (even) as a parent, I can walk through that door and just walk back to a classroom,” Young said. “There are protocols, and they are tight and there’s a reason for that: for their safety.”
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine released a statement after the Minnesota allegations began to make headlines, and held a press conference with Ohio Department of Children and Youth Director Kara Wente soon after.
They said Ohio’s system is diligent in addressing allegations of fraud should they come about, and maintaining high standards in child care facilities.
In 2025, Wente and DeWine said there were 124 referrals from the public about facilities, and of those, 61 overpayments were identified, and 12 facilities were closed.
So far this year, Wente said “with all of the statements, and press conferences, and social media,” the agency has received more than 60 referrals.
Referrals are allegations, and haven’t necessarily been investigated or proven any wrongdoing.
Wente attended the press conference introducing Plummer and Young’s bill, urging support for the added protection, and increased authority for the department to keep funds from facilities until an investigation is complete.
“What we know is there are times when we need to turn the spigot off to the public funds, and then continue the investigation and have the ability to work with the provider and come back,” Wente said.
She said the bill also helps the department continue work they’ve already done, creating new avenues for data.
The department just started a “random sample” of 400 child care programs “to collect data and to see what was happening in the program itself,” according to Wente.
“We can’t be at 5,200 programs every day, we are reliant on our data and we are reliant on our analytics, which this bill will help improve,” Wente said.
The director also said “program integrity reviews” were happening at child care facilities in Ohio “well before the headlines started” about Minnesota.
The federal government seems satisfied with Ohio’s program, though. Wente said the department received approval for Child Care Development Block Grant funds on Jan. 13, another federal approval on Jan. 14, and approval for federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) funding last week.
“We depend on these federal dollars,” Plummer said. “We’re doing the best job we can do to protect those federal dollars.”
Child care supporters and organizations in the state have also said oversight is solid, but early childhood advocacy group Groundwork Ohio said they appreciated state leaders and the bill’s sponsors for “responding quickly and seriously to concerns of fraud in the child care system by putting forth a reasonable proposal.”

Before Martin Luther King Jr. was killed, he asked several of his friends to continue his life’s work building what he called “beloved community.” One of the people he invited was the Vietnamese Zen Buddhist monk, poet and mindfulness teacher Thich Nhat Hanh.
My new book, “On Mindful Democracy: A Declaration of Interdependence to Mend a Fractured World,” is inspired by King and Hanh’s friendship. These two men bonded over the shared insight that how we show up for each other matters, as does how we advocate for social change. In his sermon “Loving Your Enemies” King announced, “Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that.” Hanh taught: There is no way to peace, peace is the way.“
At the heart of beloved community is true democracy. To be agents of change who do not add to the suffering of the world, people must learn to become more loving and peaceful people.
 ‘The real enemies of man’

Hanh was born in 1926 in central Vietnam. As a young Buddhist monk living in a nation confronted by colonialism, conflict and war, he developed the doctrine of ”engaged Buddhism,“ premised on the belief that working to relieve suffering in the world is enlightenment.
During the mid-1960s, amid the Vietnam War – Vietnamese call it the “American War” – Hanh founded the School of Youth for Social Services to practice engaged Buddhism and help those affected by the bombs raining down on their homes.
On June 1, 1965, Hanh wrote a letter to King to raise awareness of the suffering of the Vietnamese people. He also hoped to correct some common misconceptions about Buddhism.
His overarching point was that Buddhists in Vietnam did not hate Americans. In fact, they did not hate anyone. Their goal was simply to bring an end to war – and an end to the delusions that led to war. “Their enemies are not man. They are intolerance, fanaticism, dictatorship, cupidity, hatred and discrimination which lie within the heart of man,” he wrote. “These are the real enemies of man – not man himself.”
Hanh refused to take a side during the war. He stood for peace. His peace activism earned him a 39-year banishment from his homeland.
 Continuing King’s dream

Marc Andrus, author of the 2021 book “Brothers in the Beloved Community,” notes that King and Hanh met in person twice: once in Chicago, on May 31, 1966, and a second time in May 1967, at the World Council of Churches Peace on Earth Conference in Geneva, Switzerland. In Geneva, King shared his understanding of the beloved community with Hanh, inviting him to participate in its construction.
In between these two meetings, King nominated Hanh for the 1967 Nobel Peace Prize, writing in his nomination letter, “I know Thich Nhat Hanh, and am privileged to call him my friend.” No award was given that year, however, perhaps to protest King’s choice to make his nomination letter public. Nominations were typically private, but King used his to call out the injustice of the Vietnam War.
Hanh was crushed when he learned of King’s death in 1968. “I was in New York when I heard the news of his assassination; I was devastated. I could not eat; I could not sleep,” he later recalled. “I made a deep vow to continue building what he called ‘the beloved community’ not only for myself but for him also. I have done what I promised Martin Luther King Jr. And I think that I have always felt his support.”
 Building ‘beloved community’

In the years after King’s murder, part of Hanh’s life work was devoted to fulfilling King’s dream and building the “beloved community.”
Beloved community is not an abstraction. It is a loose-knit global community composed of a multitude of smaller, local communities committed to practicing peace, nonviolence, freedom, love and justice. Emerging from King’s activism and Hanh’s engaged Buddhism, these communities are also committed to social change.
In 1982, Hanh and his student Sister Chan Khong established the Plum Village monastery in southern France. In the years since, the Plum Village community has founded dozens of monasteries around the world, including three in the United States: Blue Cliff in upstate New York, Deer Park outside San Diego, and Magnolia Grove in Mississippi.
Hanh’s lay students have established thousands of smaller Plum Village sanghas – communities – in North America and Europe. These monasteries and sanghas serve as practice centers where people learn to embody the ideals of beloved community in their mindfulness practice and daily lives.
Since the time of the Buddha, people committed to the path of mindfulness have agreed to live by a number of “precepts.” These precepts, typically numbering five, provide a moral foundation for action. Hundreds of thousands of people attending Plum Village retreats have agreed to live by the updated, secular version of the precepts that Hanh and his community wrote called the Five Mindfulness Trainings. These include: reverence for life, true happiness, true love, loving speech and deep listening, and nourishment and healing.
The Five Mindfulness Trainings are written to provide people with a practical path to building a shared life based in love, compassion, joy and peace: the type of life that both King and Hanh envisioned for all.
As Hanh told the global Plum Village community in a 2020 letter titled Climbing Together the Hill of the Century: “We have continued that aspiration of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and every day, our practice is to generate brotherhood and sisterhood, to cultivate joy and the capacity to help people. This is a concrete way to realize and continue that dream.”
On MLK Day, their friendship and writings are a reminder that democracy rests on the ability of citizens to be present for each other, to recognize their interconnectedness, to embody loving kindness and to disagree without resorting to violence.

The government of this state works for you.
You know who has the best claim to that glorious Statehouse building in downtown Topeka? You do. Not lawmakers or lobbyists or associated special interests. That building exists to make your life and the lives of your friends and neighbors better. However bizarre or dark the news that flows from that place, never forget your ownership of its marble halls.


Statehouse scraps
Opinion editor Clay Wirestone’s weekly roundup of Kansas legislative exploits. Read the archive.


You can visit. You should visit. Anyone can come into the building and watch the House or Senate in session. You can chat with those lawmakers or lobbyists or associated special interests. You can just watch and make fun of them in your mind.
You don’t need to have to a reason to go. Drop by anytime during business hours. That’s the power of living in a representative democracy. Your elected officials answer to you. If they don’t, they will shortly be replaced by other elected officials. Any Kansan has the right, even the obligation, to check up on those paid to govern on their behalf.
I had already planned to kick off my inaugural Statehouse Scraps column of 2026 with this little sermon. But it turns out that someone else had similar thoughts last week.
This would be AFL-CIO executive secretary-treasurer Jake Lowen, who told a labor rally Wednesday that the Statehouse can feel like it’s built for “other people, fancy people, people in suits.”
“But you know what? This is your house. This is your state,” he proclaimed.


 

 Opinion editor Clay Wirestone and editor in chief Sherman Smith sum up the Kansas Legislature’s week in the first installment of Statehouse Chats.
He’s right.
One of the reasons that I write about legislators the way I do — irreverently, including comparisons to tipsy raccoons — is that we treat people in power with far too much reverence. They work for us. Sure, people might badmouth lawmakers on Facebook, but they don’t want to make waves in public.
That good-natured civility makes sense while avoiding conflict in your daily life. But it doesn’t work if it keeps you from voicing what you believe and demanding the people who serve you do their jobs.
So get in the car and visit the Statehouse. I know that folks in western Kansas face more of a challenge than those of us in the northeast. But you owe it to yourself to see where policy is made that affects all 3 million Kansas. All the lawmakers and public officials who work in the building must be reminded that they don’t do it for themselves or positive headlines.
They do it for you.

Their usual villains
The Legislature replayed one of its greatest hits last week. One of 2026’s first committee hearings tackled favorite Republican villains: transgender people.
You might think that trans folks just live among us out in the world, going to work and raising families and drinking Diet Coke. As people do. But no, because trans folks express their true gender identity, Kansas officials have targeted them repeatedly in recent years. Remember kids, elected officials believe that being different is bad.
The latest bill was touted by Secretary of State Kris Kobach as a way to supposedly reduce confusion with driver’s licenses and birth certificates. It would  ultimately require that these documents list a person’s sex at birth.
This justification didn’t make any sense with earlier bills. It doesn’t make any sense now.
If someone is a transgender woman, the vast majority of the time they’re going to look like a woman. You’re going to identify that person as a woman if you see them out and about. If someone is a transgender man, the vast majority of the time they’re going to look like a man. You’re going to identify that person as a man if you see them out and about.
Forcing these people to carry identification documents that don’t align with their public presentation is a recipe for the exact confusion that Kobach decries. It also opens the door for law enforcement and officials to abuse transgender people.
Hundreds of pieces of testimony from those opposing House Bill 2426 were submitted on a laughably short timeframe. Advocates turned out in droves to oppose the bill — as they always have and always will.
Will the Republican leaders who direct their caucus listen? Count me skeptical.

Speedy session
For the second year in a row, word in the hallways of the Statehouse is that Senate President Ty Masterson, and House Speaker Dan Hawkins want to keep the session short and tight. Last year, the motivation appeared unclear — it did give both chambers the excuse to bypass traditional debate and discussion — but this year it’s no mystery.
Elections draw near.
Lawmakers won’t be able to raise money or campaign until the session ends. With primaries in August and the general in November, you better believe that Kansas politicians want to hit the road rather than sit in boring committee meetings.
This cuts both ways. On one hand, lawmakers will have less opportunity to pass hateful or harmful legislation (see above). On the other, leaders use tight deadlines to their advantage by rushing through legislation without appropriate vetting. This gets especially touchy when it comes to budgets and various line items, which can be fiddled with up until the last minute.

Closed GOP caucus
You might remember that House Republicans closed their daily caucus meetings to members of the news media last session. I wrote a whole column about the break with longstanding practice.
From the evidence of last week, they’re doing it again. I showed up at a caucus meeting Tuesday morning along with Reflector reporter Anna Kaminski. She checked and was told the gathering was off-limits for reporters. I’m going to monitor the situation as the session continues, and you’ll be hearing more in the weeks that come.
Meanwhile, Senate and House leadership continue to restrict press access to the floors of their respective chambers. (And not inviting us to their press conferences.) Don’t worry; we’ll cover them anyway.

Scraps on board
Welcome to the 2026 edition of Statehouse Scraps. I started writing this roundup column back in 2023. For three sessions, it appeared on Saturdays and collected tidbits from the week before.
For this 2026 session, I’m treating it somewhat differently. You’ll still see bits and bobs from the week that was, but I’ve decided to run it on Mondays. That allows us to talk more about the week that’s coming up and give you a sense of the big storylines in Topeka.
Press corps shifts at the Statehouse and continued pullback from publishers in covering state government news means that Kansas Reflector has a bigger role than ever in informing Kansas about the session. I want to respond to that, and I want to make sure you know we’re looking out for you.
As part of that effort, we’re also unveiling a weekly video podcast with editor-in-chief Sherman Smith and myself talking about the big stories and offering our own observations about what’s going on. Please let us know what you think.

(Photo nu Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s words from his “Beyond Vietnam” speech still ring true.
“When machines and computers, profit motives, and property rights are considered more important than people,” he warned, “the giant triplets of racism, extreme materialism, and militarism are incapable of being conquered.”
Those words, delivered in 1967, still summarize today’s political moment. Instead of putting the lives of working Americans first, our leaders in Congress and the White House have prioritized advancing corporate profits and wealth concentration, slashing government programs meant to advance upward mobility, and deploying military forces across the country, increasing distrust and tension.
This historic regression corresponds with a recessionary environment for Black America in particular. That’s what my organization, the Joint Center, found in our report, “State of the Dream 2026: From Regression to Signs of a Black Recession.”
The economic landscape for Black Americans in 2026 is troubling, with unemployment rates signaling a potential recession. By December 2025, Black unemployment had reached 7.5% — a stark contrast to the national rate of 4.4%. This disparity highlights the persistent economic inequalities faced by Black communities, which have only been exacerbated by policy shifts that have weakened the labor market. The volatility in Black youth unemployment, which fluctuated dramatically in the latter months of 2025, underscores the precariousness of the situation.
The Trump administration’s executive orders have systematically dismantled structures aimed at promoting racial equality. By targeting programs such as Lyndon Johnson’s 1965 Equal Employment Opportunity executive order and defunding agencies like the Minority Business Development Agency, the administration has shifted federal support away from disadvantaged businesses.
As a result, Black-owned firms risk losing contracts and resources tied to federal programs, potentially resulting in job losses and reduced economic growth. These changes threaten billions in federal revenue for Black-owned firms and undermine efforts to move beyond racial inequality in the workforce.
The GOP’s so-called “Big Beautiful Bill,” passed in 2025, further entrenches inequality by providing tax cuts that disproportionately benefit high-income households and corporations — while simultaneously slashing investments in programs like Medicaid and SNAP, limiting access to essential services for low-income households.
The technology sector, a critical component of the American economy, is also affected by this disregard for civil rights. Executive orders like “Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence” have stripped away protections that could advance inclusion in this rapidly growing field. As a result, the future of the American economy risks reinforcing past inequalities.
Dr. King’s call for strong, aggressive federal leadership in addressing racial inequality remains highly relevant. However, instead of eradicating structures of inequality, our current leadership is implementing policies that destroy government jobs and dismantle agencies responsible for preventing predatory economic practices. These choices undermine longstanding efforts to combat racial and economic disparities — and exemplify the regressive economic policies that coincide with rising Black unemployment.
As Dr. King stated, “we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt.” But urgent action is required. Unless we act deliberately, economic and racial inequalities will become entrenched, resulting in generational loss. The core question is whether we will move beyond our nation’s history of racism, materialism, and militarism, and — as Dr. King urged — embrace “the fierce urgency now” to advance equity.

Connecticut needs a regional approach to housing

A bill was passed by the legislature (HB 5002), and then the governor vetoed it.
In a special session over the summer, the legislature passed another housing bill, (HB 8002) which the governor signed and is now law. There are some things about it to admire, especially the provisions that seek to help our neighbors who are hardest hit by the housing crisis — people who have no housing at all, or whose housing is threatened by eviction.
It brings the language of “smart growth” into the conversation, encouraging the adoption of transit-oriented development districts, priority development housing zones, and the like. 
But it does not address in a serious way the housing crisis.
For decades now, many of Connecticut’s towns have successfully thwarted the creation of new housing within their borders that would help address the need. And under this new law these towns will unfortunately be able to continue to do so. (I refer to towns alone, and not cities, as the handful of actual cities in Connecticut have historically encouraged housing production.)
Last January, I argued that a more regional approach to land-use planning, guided by the state’s nine councils of governments “COGs” (which are composed of the cities and towns within their jurisdictions) might be a way to navigate between: a.) the statewide goal of producing more housing and b.) the desire of towns to control development within their borders without regard to the statewide housing crisis.
The new law does, in fact, lean heavily on the data-based, regional, land-use plans that the COGs have produced for years, and which the cities in towns within each COG’s region participate in drafting. These plans consider all the factors that good land-use planning requires, like the availability of infrastructure such as roads, public transit, and water and sewer facilities, as well as environmental conditions like wetlands and the protection of other fragile resources. But they have been, historically, basically advisory.
Now, provisions in this new law encourage towns to align their town-wide zoning to the regional plan for their COG jurisdiction. It lays out a lengthy and iterative process whereby the Secretary of the Office of Policy & Management reviews town zoning codes for compliance with the regional plans’ housing goals. But — and this is a big but — if a town’s housing goals do not meet the law’s goals for alignment with the regional plan, there are no real consequences. Essentially, the secretary may deny state funding to assist that town in planning for new housing, as well as state funding to plan and construct the infrastructure related to new housing.
But if the town’s leadership doesn’t want the new housing, denying them state funds to assist them in planning for new housing is hardly much of an incentive for each town to plan for new housing that they don’t want to begin with. Gov. Ned Lamont likes to describe this approach as “towns lead the way.” But towns leading the way is precisely what got us to where we are now – at least 110,000 homes short of the need.
The new law comes close to imagining a way forward, of bridging the gap between the statewide need for more housing and the so-called “local control” advocates who rail at “interference from Hartford.” It is important to remember that the 169 cities and towns in Connecticut are not independent entities but rather political subdivisions of the state, and have only the powers that the General Assembly grants them. Local control of zoning is conducted solely by the authority granted, and the rules laid out, in Chapter 124 of the Connecticut General Statues.
What this law still needs, if we are serious about addressing the housing shortage, is a bit more than holding back planning grants from recalcitrant towns. What I suggested a year ago, and I advocate now, is that the regional plans be activated as enforceable documents. If a developer is denied permits to build new housing in a town, but the regional plan envisions it, the law should provide the developer with a cause of action against the town on that basis.
This would operate along the lines of Chapter 8-30(g), which gives a developer a cause of action against a town that denies permits for any housing development that proposes some amount of affordable housing, if the town’s housing stock does not meet a 10 percent minimum affordable housing standard. But Section 8-30(g) is almost an anti-planning approach. It doesn’t matter if the proposed housing is located where it doesn’t make sense from a planning standpoint. What I am advocating is a pro-planning approach. If the regional plan envisions housing for a location, but the town says “No,” then the onus should be on the town to explain their denial to a judge.
Local control advocates can’t moan about “We don’t want Hartford telling us what to do” under this approach, because every city and town within each COG would have participated in the drafting of the regional plan. These regional plans are a far better way of guiding rational growth than arbitrary, one size fits all, standards for all 169 cities and towns. And we should use them, and let developers rely on them, and stop letting local control advocates, and the town governments they hold sway over, thwart us from meeting our housing goals as a state.

It is a present-day crisis affecting tens of thousands of families and straining our health care system in ways we can no longer afford to ignore.
  More than 80,000 Connecticut residents aged 65 and older are currently living with Alzheimer’s or other dementias. An estimated 130,000 family members provide unpaid care, contributing over 200 million hours annually – labor valued at more than $5 billion. At the same time, Medicaid spending related to Alzheimer’s exceeds $1.2 billion each year. These figures represent not only an economic burden, but countless households quietly navigating exhaustion, financial strain, and grief.
I know this reality personally. I am a Connecticut resident and a constituent of Rep. Jahana Hayes in the 5th District. Through sustained advocacy with her office, I was proud to see her cosponsor two bipartisan bills in 2025: the AADAPT Act and the ASAP Act. These bills focus on earlier diagnosis, improved access to care planning, and a stronger national response to dementia – all critical steps for families facing this disease.
  Early detection matters. New treatments and clinical trials are most effective in the earliest stages of Alzheimer’s, yet too many people in Connecticut still receive diagnoses late, after years of missed or minimized symptoms. By then, options are limited, caregivers are already overwhelmed, and the trajectory of the disease is far harder to alter.
Connecticut has an opportunity to lead, but leadership requires urgency. It means supporting federal legislation that prioritizes early diagnosis and equitable access to care. It means strengthening caregiver supports and ensuring our health and social services systems are prepared for the realities of an aging population.
  CT Mirror published my letter on Alzheimer’s advocacy last summer. I’m writing again because the crisis has not eased – it has intensified. Families are still absorbing the burden largely alone, and the costs – human and economic – continue to rise.
  Alzheimer’s is not just a personal tragedy. It is a public health emergency. Connecticut can, and must, respond accordingly.

(Photo by STATEHOUSE CAROLINA/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — With two months to go before candidates must file to be on this year’s ballots, the state Democratic Party made a plea.
“RUN FOR OFFICE in 2026,” reads the top of an email sent Jan. 7 from state Democratic Party Chairwoman Christale Spain.
Democrats have announced bids for just two of the seven constitutional offices on the ballot this November: governor and state superintendent of education. The party is still talking with potential candidates, Spain told the SC Daily Gazette.
In her email, she pointed to that week’s slim margin of victory for Republican Greg Ford in a special election for a state House seat representing Dorchester County. He defeated Democrat Sonja Ogletree Satani by just 21 votes, as determined by an automatic recount.
Ogletree Satani “ran one heck of a race,” Spain wrote, noting that President Donald Trump won the district by over 6 percentage points in 2024. (Statewide, he won by 18 points.) “The lesson to all of us is that we can compete and win if we run!”
The email was successful, Spain told the Gazette on Wednesday.
In one week, more than a hundred people filled out the candidate interest form attached to that email. “Dozens” of them checked a box showing interest in seeking a statewide office, according to Jon Burton, a party spokesperson.


Upcoming deadlines
To compete in the June 9 party primaries, candidates must file the forms and pay the required fees between March 16 and March 30.
The fee is 1% of the job’s salary over the entire term.
For statewide offices, that ranges from $4,243 for gubernatorial candidates to $8,560 to run for state superintendent.


It’s been 32 years since a Democrat competed for every statewide elected office in the South Carolina constitution. And back in 1994, there were two additional offices on the ballot.
The party has come close to having a candidate for every office since.
In 2006, a Democrat ran for every statewide office except attorney general. Then-Attorney General Henry McMaster ran unopposed for re-election that year. In 2002, the only constitutional office without a Democrat running was adjutant general, the leader of the state’s military department. Maj. Gen. Stan Spears ran unopposed that year for his fourth and final term before retiring. In 2014, voters approved taking that office off the ballot and making it a governor-appointed position.
Asked about Spain’s email, state GOP Chairman Drew McKissick said Democrats’ problem “isn’t a lack of candidates.
“It’s that voters simply aren’t buying what they’re selling,” he said in a statement to the SC Daily Gazette.
Two races with both parties on the ballot
A Democrat last won a statewide office in 2006, when Jim Rex was elected state superintendent of education by fewer than 500 votes.
This year, two Democrats, Lisa Ellis and Sylvia Wright, are running for the job overseeing the state agency for K-12 public schools. Whoever wins the June 9 Democratic primary will likely face Superintendent Ellen Weaver, who’s running for her second term. So far, no Republican has announced a challenge.
In 2022, the race for superintendent was the most crowded: Six Republicans and three Democrats ran to replace outgoing Superintendent Molly Spearman.
Ellis was a first-time candidate then. The 25-year veteran teacher of Richland 2 high schools, who in 2018 founded the online teachers’ group SC for Ed, won a three-way primary outright without needing a runoff, then lost to Weaver by 16 percentage points. In 2023, SC for Ed announced an indefinite pause to its lobbying efforts, four years after organizing a teachers’ rally at the Statehouse attended by an estimated 10,000 people.
Wright, who has two decades of classroom and administrative experience in rural South Carolina, resigned from her job last fall as a district coordinator for Dorchester 4 in order to campaign full-time.
Among all the statewide races on the ballot this year, the wide-open governor’s race has by far gotten the most attention.
It’s been 16 years since no incumbent ran for governor. Five Republicans and two Democrats have announced bids to replace Gov. Henry McMaster, who first ascended to the job nine years ago when then-Gov. Nikki Haley joined President Donald Trump’s first administration. So, when voters first elected McMaster to the job in 2018, he’d already been governor almost two years.
In South Carolina, governors are limited to two elected terms. Other constitutional offices have no term limitations.
Two other offices are wide open
Two other statewide offices that have gotten little attention are wide open for the first time in over two decades.
Agriculture Commissioner Hugh Weathers is not seeking a sixth full term. It’s been 16 years since a Democrat challenged him.
Voters first elected Weathers in 2006, two years after Gov. Mark Sanford appointed the Orangeburg County dairy farmer to the job following the indictment of Charlie Sharpe, who was eventually sentenced to two years in prison for taking a bribe to protect a cockfighting ring.
Weathers endorsed Republican Fred West to replace him, The State newspaper reported last March. West retired in 2023 after 24 years as an executive at the poultry processing company Amick Farms and his since become director of market development at the Department of Agriculture.
So far, West is the only candidate to announce a bid to lead the agency with duties that include promoting one of the state’s top industries, keeping the food supply safe, and — since 2024 — handling all inspections of places that sell food, such as restaurants and cafeterias.
The job of comptroller general is open for the first time in 28 years, when then-Sen. Jim Landers replaced the retiring Earle Morris Jr.
That 1998 election was also the last time a Democrat won the post as the state’s chief accountant. In 2002, Republican Richard Eckstrom ousted Landers and kept the job for 21 years. Eckstrom resigned in 2023 amid mounting pressure over his office’s $3.5 billion accounting error. (The error was strictly on paper. No money went missing due. The office mistakenly double-counted some agencies’ revenue.)
McMaster made history in appointing his budget director, Brian Gaines, who by agreeing to run the office temporarily became South Carolina’s first Black constitutional officer since Reconstruction. Gaines said at the time he had no interest in running in 2026.
One Republican has announced a bid: Mike Burkhold, a Charleston businessman who founded Equiscript, a health care technology company.
For two other statewide offices, Republicans are seeking re-election without any announced competition.
Secretary of State Mark Hammond, first elected in 2002, is seeking a seventh term leading the office that registers and helps regulate businesses and charities operating in South Carolina. (Unlike in other states, South Carolina’s secretary of state plays no role at all in overseeing elections.)
Treasurer Curtis Loftis, first elected in 2010, also got came under fire recently for accounting problems. Senate investigations into the comptroller general’s office led to discovery of a $1.8 billion error in the treasurer’s office — also a blunder on paper that didn’t affect state revenues or the Legislature’s budgeting process. An outside accounting firm found that all but $200 million never existed. But senators were incensed, voting 33 to 8 last April to remove him. The House, however, never took up the case.
Amid a grilling from senators, Loftis initially pledged that he would not seek re-election in 2026. But he later reversed course and announced he’s seeking a fifth term. He maintains that he did nothing wrong.

convened in the second half of the 153rd Session of the General Assembly, this week.  The normal, more relaxed tone to the opening session was tempered by recent events, including the murder of Cpl. Matthew “Ty” Snook at the Delaware DMV offices two weeks ago.  Tensions seemed to be running high, leading to an outburst on the Senate floor, as Senate Concurrent Resolution 114 was introduced.  This is a measure, introduced by Sen. Bryant Richardson, that would add Delaware to the list of states authorizing an Article V “Convention of the States” resolution to introduce a slate of U.S. Constitutional amendments.  Heated exchanges led to a call for greater civility in these floor discussions, with a resolution (SCR124) by Sen. Kyra Hoffner passing unanimously in the Senate and echoed by a voice vote in the House, shortly after.  Sen. Brian Pettyjohn reinforced the unanimous call for civility in legislator discourse.  The resolution for the Convention of States, failed to pass with a vote of 7-7, with 7 senators choosing not to vote.  Senator Hansen joined the Republican members in voting for the resolution.
The session opened with a resolution recognizing “Law Enforcement Appreciation Day” as January 9th.  Comments we made by Sen. Nicole Poore, a close friend of the Snook family, and Secretary of the Senate, Ryan Dunphy, Snook’s brother-in-law.
There were a handful of other bills addressed in the opening days.  These included:
SB213 – “Amend Code Related to Hospital Review Board” 

This controversial law from 2025 was amended according to an agreement that followed legal challenges by hospital associations. The bill would still require hospitals to submit financial data to the Diamond State Hospital Cost Review Board to increase transparency around costs and spending trends, however it removes the authority of the board to approve or modify future budgets.  The bill was released from the Senate Executive Committee, with all 7 members approving (2 “Favorable”, 5 “On the Merits”) and sent to the Senate Floor for a vote.  There is an end of January deadline in the agreement related to the legal challenges.

SB222 – “Term Limits for Legislators, Attorney General, State Treasurer, State Auditor and State Insurance Commissioner” 

Senators would be limited to 5 terms, Representatives would be limited to 8 terms and others would be limited to 2 terms each.

SB106 – “Cell Phone Use Policies for Schools” 
Did not dictate policy, but laid out areas that must be addressed by the school policy.  This passed the Senate unanimously in 2025 and was passed by the House unanimously at the start of the 2026 session.
SB27 – “Establishing the Office of New Americans”

Codifies the executive actions of Gov. Meyer to establish this office “to help improve the lives and economic prosperity of new Americans who come to Delaware.” There does not appear to be a distinction between legal and illegal immigrants in this bill.  A sunset provision was added by Sen. Bryant Richardson.  The measure passed the Senate, as amended, unanimously and was sent to the House.

SB188 “Expand Permit to Purchase Handgun Exemptions to Law Enforcement Procurement”

The “Permit to Purchase” law (SB2) had not excluded the purchasing function of law enforcement agencies to supply their officers and candidates. This passed unanimously in the Senate and was sent to the House.  In a related article, we will explore the impact of SB2, as Delaware handgun purchases are down by 80%, as the processes for obtaining and exercising permits are not fully in place.  This is placing an incredible financial burden on firearms dealers in the state.

A number of other bills are expected to receive attention in this current session, including:
HS2 for HB13 “Added/Revised Tax Brackets”

Creates added brackets for $150K (amended from $125K), $250K & $500K, as the state faces concerns over decreasing revenue. This bill was deferred, as revenue estimates for 2026 were increased.  There is long term concern over the pace of budget increases.

HB72, HB73 & HB108 “Property and Income Tax Relief for Seniors”

Republican-sponsored bills to increase the Senior property tax deduction, reduce the residency period back to 3 years and increase the pension exclusion were not allowed to progress.

SB2 & SB3 Constitutional Amendments Affecting “Early, In-Person” and “No Excuse Absentee” Voting have progressed  to House vote.  HB65 “Moving Primary Election Date to April” is also pending Senate vote.

These CA’s will require 2027-2028 votes, if passed. HB65 will align primary dates with Presidential Primary and provide for longer General Election campaign.  These were all deferred to 2026 and will not affect the 2026 elections.

Protections for Illegal Immigration are progressing – HB58, HB60, HB93, HB94 , HB95, HB96, HB150 & HB151

Limiting schools and State/local law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration enforcement agencies or providing information from state files and resources. These were not yet passed in 2025.

(Photo: Izzy Ross/IPR News)This story is made possible through a partnership between Interlochen Public Radio and Grist, a nonprofit environmental media organization.
Students at Traverse City West Senior High School are raising money to install solar panels on their campus so they can learn about renewable energy.
Srinergy, a Michigan-based solar company, donated 14 ground panels to the school and students need to fundraise money to cover installation costs. They aim to raise more than $11,000 by the end of this school year.
The school’s Environmental Club is leading the effort. Lucy Jones, the club’s president and senior at TC West, said clean energy like solar will only become more common as students get older. That makes this project important for their education, she said.
“It’s good for students to learn about it now and learn about how it works, so then in the future, they’re able to know about it and use renewable energy in their lives,” Jones said.
The goal of the project is to teach students, but the 14 panels would generate about 7,000 kilowatt hours of electricity for the building. That’s an estimated 5% of the school’s electricity use, according to the project proposal from Srinergy.
Mary Brisbois, a science teacher at TC West, said data from these solar panels could help teach students in her environmental science class about how renewable energy works. Other science and math teachers have expressed interest to Brisbois in using data for their classes, too.
Students are also responsible for fundraising, she said. That way, students can learn that “money is something to figure out” and not always “a complete roadblock,” Brisbois said.
Lyla Hollis is a clean energy specialist at the nonprofit Groundwork Center for Resilient Communities and a partner in the school solar project. She said just seeing the installation of the panels could be beneficial to students.
“Getting the solar panels installed into the electric system is not that hard, but it is a process, and to learn how to do that on a small scale is pretty cool to see,” Hollis said. “The actual steps, you can implement it in different classes and learn how the chemistry works and all that stuff, which is more than I learned in school.”
Jones said she’s optimistic her classmates will raise enough money by the end of the year, with the help of the local community. And she’s excited for future students to benefit, long after she graduates.
“It’ll be something that the whole school will get to see and experience and gain information and knowledge from and then on to future generations,” she said. “It’s kind of like giving something to the school and giving back to our community.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/m-72-solar-panels-8.2.23-1024x768.png,,,2026-01-18 13:56:44.118578

Currently, two bills aiming to expand Michigan’s FOIA laws (Senate Bills 1 and 2) are sitting in the House’s Governmental Operations Committee awaiting discussion. However, Michigan Speaker of the House Matt Hall stated that he wasn’t interested in putting the bills on the agenda.
“We’re just not going to do FOIA,” Hall told reporters during a Nov. 6 press conference.
Michigan’s Democratic-led Senate started 2025 by quickly introducing and passing the bills, with 33 yeas and two nays. After moving off the Senate floor, SB 1 and 2 were read by the House and have remained in committee since January.

“If this were put up for a vote in the House, it would pass,” said Sen. Jeremy Moss (D-Bloomfield Township), co-author of the bills. “There’s no doubt. It has the votes.

The passing of these bills completes part of Hall’s Ethics, Accountability and Transparency, or HEAT, plan, which he believes will be more beneficial to the public than expanding FOIA.
“We ask people all the time, they know HEAT will have a much better benefit than  FOIA,” Hall said during the conference.
Michigan Press Association Public Policy Manager Lisa McGraw said that the reform bill is a step in the right direction, but that the state government could, and should, do more.
“I think until the governor and the legislature in the state are subject to FOIA, we really have no transparency at the state level,” said McGraw, who has been working to expand FOIA since 2015.
Hall did not provide comment for this story.
Senators Moss and McBroom’s mission for FOIA
SB 1 and 2 are in the same position as other FOIA expansion bills that have been introduced in recent years.
Since joining the State Senate in 2019, Moss and Sen. Ed McBroom (R-Vulcan) have co-authored four bills in an attempt to expand FOIA:

Senate Bill 1 of 2025
Senate Bill 2 of 2025
Senate Bill 669 of 2023
Senate Bill 670 of 2023

While serving as the state representative for Michigan’s 35th District, Moss introduced House Bill 4149 of 2017, which would have made the legislature and the governor subject to FOIA. Just like his and McBroom’s Senate bills, the House bill was referred to committee and wasn’t put on the agenda for a vote.
“It was the first bipartisan package that got out of the House that term, and the Senate Leader (Arlan Meekhof) said, ‘I’m not taking this up,’” Moss said.
According to a 2017 story by the Detroit Free Press, Meekhof told journalists, “You guys are the only people who care about this” referencing Moss and McBroom’s bill.
Both senators will be term limited at the end of 2026. Both stated they will continue to push for expanding the public’s right to know.
“We would really like to see this project through,” Moss said. “It’s not fun to work on something for 10 years, and make progress on it, and not get past the finish line. But we’re working really, really hard to achieve this.”
The campaign on FOIA expansion
In 2018, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer stated that she would work to expand FOIA laws to include the governor’s office and legislature.
“I mean, unilaterally we could open up the executive branch to FOIA and ensure that there is real notice and real searchable capabilities online,” Whitmer said in an interview on PBS Detroit in July of 2018. “The public and the press need tools so they can get information.”
Whitmer signed Public Acts 32 and 33 of 2025 into law and praised the bills.
“Since I took office, I’ve been committed to increasing transparency in our government, so Michiganders know exactly where their hard-earned dollars are going,” Whitmer stated in a press release. “I made a promise to increase transparency on legislative earmarks in my most recent State of the State. Less than a year later, I’m proud to sign these two bills that require lawmakers to put their names on any projects they propose.”
“I’ll keep working with anyone to serve Michiganders and increase transparency in our government.”

Whitmer made the calendars for her office and the office of Lt. Governor Garlin Gilchrist open to the public – as well as her federal income tax returns and personal financial information.
However, her promise to extend FOIA to her office has not yet been met.
Whitmer did not provide comment for this story.
“Since the (Whitmer) administration started, we have not gone anywhere despite an entire campaign called the Sunshine Report, when she was running the first time,” said McGraw.
In 2018, Whitmer released an eight-page document titled “Get it Done: Michigan Sunshine Plan,” highlighting issues with Michigan’s transparency and ethics laws and what she wanted to change if elected governor.
“If the legislature won’t act, I will use the governor’s authority under the Michigan State Constitution to extend FOIA to the Lieutenant Governor and Governor’s Offices,” Whitmer stated in the report. “ Michiganders should know when and what their governor is working on.”
While discussing the history of politicians advocating for expanding FOIA, Attorney General Dana Nessel told Central Michigan Life that false promises are often made during campaigns.
“No one runs for governor being like, ‘absolutely not, I don’t agree with that,” Nessel said. “Everyone says what they think everyone wants to hear, and maybe they really think that, until they get (into office).’’
As Whitmer’s term comes to an end in 2026, candidates in the gubernatorial race have started to make promises on expanding FOIA.
“On day one, I will voluntarily comply with FOIA,” said Democratic candidate Jocelyn Benson, who has served as Secretary of State since 2019. “Every job I’ve had, whether it’s been running a law school or running the Department of State, I’ve complied with FOIA proudly.”
Republican candidate and Former House Speaker Tom Leonard shared a similar commitment during an interview with Central Michigan Life in October.
“Michigan is only one of two states in the entire country whose executive branch and legislature is not subject to open records and FOIA. That needs to change,” Leonard said. “People of this state deserve to know what’s going on in their executive branch and legislature.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_9944-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-18 11:56:26.353815

(Photo by Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota’s second most populous county has agreed it will no longer jail people who can’t afford to pay the daily fees attached to the state’s signature sobriety program.
Pennington County’s settlement in a federal class action lawsuit could impact the way counties operate the 24-7 program, which originated in South Dakota and has since spread to other states. 
People accused of crimes involving drugs or alcohol can be assigned to the program and released as they await trial, or as part of their sentence, on the condition they submit to sobriety monitoring and pay for it.
The participation price varies based on the type of monitoring involved and how long a person takes part. Some people pay $2 a day for breath testing, while others pay $30-$42 a week for urinalysis drug testing or alcohol monitoring bracelets. Judges also permit participants to shift from one method to another along the way to better suit their financial or life circumstances. 
Some people remain on the program for weeks or months, and occasionally for a year or more, depending on how long it takes for their case to work its way through the court system. 
Drunken driving courts prepare for more action from minimum-sentence law

The Pennington County settlement comes in a lawsuit filed in 2023 by a Rapid City man named Ricky Lookingback, who’d been ordered to participate in drug testing. 
He was jailed for failure to pay a 24-7 fee, which he argued was a violation of constitutional prohibitions on jailing people for debt. He also alleged that he belonged to a class of individuals who’d been jailed for the same reason in Pennington County, and asked for a judgment on behalf of all class members.
Under the terms of the agreement, Lookingback and 37 others jailed for inability to pay program fees are members of the class and are each eligible for cash payments, with Lookingback in line for $10,000 and the others for $1,000 each. The settlement also dictates that no one can be jailed or threatened with jail time for their inability to pay program fees.
Class members will have the opportunity to object to the terms of the settlement at a hearing in February. A federal judge can then accept or reject the agreement, which has been signed by Lookingback and county officials.
Jim Leach, Lookingback’s Rapid City lawyer, said the settlement should put all South Dakota counties on notice that jailing the indigent is a civil rights violation and could draw a legal challenge.
“I’ve got nothing against the 24-7 program,” Leach said in an interview with South Dakota Searchlight. “From everything I can gather, it’s a really good program that has helped a lot of people. But nonetheless, the basic constitutional law in this country is that we cannot jail people for poverty.”
24-7 built on frequent testing, participant fees
Under the 24-7 program, testing fees are due at the time of testing or in advance.
In the cheapest and most common form of 24-7, people appear twice daily at a local jail to take breath tests for alcohol, at a cost of $1 per test. Those who fail a test or fail to show up can be put in jail, after which a judge decides whether to release them again.
More than 90,000 people have been on some version of the program since its launch, and hundreds participate every day. Its rollout began as a three-county pilot project in 2005 under the guidance of former Attorney General Larry Long, who’d tried it decades earlier as Bennett County’s state’s attorney.
In testimony before the Legislature in 2022, Long called it “the most efficient tool to reduce DUIs ever enacted in South Dakota.”
Driving under the influence arrests have not dropped dramatically since the program launched, but they also haven’t grown in line with the state’s population, which is 20% higher today than in 2005. 
DUI arrests hit 11,612 in 2024, the last full year reported in the Department of Public Safety’s annual summary. That was the highest tally since 2007, the year the 24-7 program went statewide, when there were 11,756 DUI arrests. 
Long stepped down as attorney general in 2009 to become a circuit court judge. In an interview with South Dakota Searchlight, he said DUIs holding more or less steady is a sign that the program works. 
The bigger impact, Long said, has been on felony drunken driving charges and alcohol-related traffic crashes. 
In 2007, when the program went statewide, there were 1,092 felony DUI charges, each representing a third or subsequent offense. By 2017, the year he retired as a judge, that number had fallen to 699. In the last fiscal year, there were 468 charges for such repeat offenses, according to the Unified Judicial System.
Alcohol-related crashes, meanwhile, hit a record high of 630 in 2006, according to the Department of Public Safety. The highest tally since then was 535, recorded in 2021. In 2024, there were 458 such crashes.
Since its start in South Dakota, versions of the 24-7 program have spread to other states, including North Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, Wisconsin and Utah.
Constitutional concerns about jailing the program’s poorest participants have always been a sticking point, Long said, even for people who’ve generally supported the concept. 
The price point for breath tests was set low intentionally, he said, in hopes of making the program accessible to the widest range of people.
From the start, Long advised the county sheriffs who run the programs that an inability to pay shouldn’t be enough to draw immediate sanctions. 
“What I used to say during my presentations was ‘if you skip or if you fail, you go to jail,’” said Long. “You don’t go to jail for not paying.”
Long acknowledged, however, that local officials may not have always followed that guidance.
There are no statewide statistics on how many people may have been jailed for failure to pay 24-7 fees, according to the Attorney’s General’s Office, since counties manage their own programs. During debate on a bill to alter the program in 2022, administrators said punishment for failure to pay alone is a rarity, based on reports from counties.
Fees still too much for some
The 24-7 fees may be fairly low, but they’re still more than some people have, said Leach. 
Lookingback was and remains homeless, Leach said, and he was placed in a version of 24-7 that required him to take three drug tests each week, at a cost of $10 per test. 
Court documents in the case, filed by Pennington County, say Lookingback was released from jail and ordered to sign in to the program and did not on multiple occasions in 2023. On those occasions, the county said, he was sanctioned for failure to appear for testing.
In the fall of that year, he was again ordered into the program. On Sept. 23, 2023, he showed up but didn’t have the $10 needed to pay the fees. As a result, Leach said, Lookingback found himself again incarcerated at the Pennington County Jail.
If a judge accepts the settlement agreement, Pennington County will pay Lookingback $10,000 for that incarceration, and will set aside another $37,000 for the 37 other people who were found to have been jailed for their inability to pay. 
Leach will be required to “make reasonable efforts” to contact the 37 people, who were identified in county records obtained over the course of the lawsuit. Any money that goes uncollected, the settlement says, will be given to a nonprofit organization called the Public Justice Debtor’s Project. The New York-based nonprofit works to address issues related to the jailing of defendants for unpaid court fees across multiple jurisdictions. 
Leach can ask the judge to order Pennington County to pay attorney’s fees, but the settlement says he’s entitled to none of the money the county’s already promised to pay through the agreement.
Helene Duhamel, spokeswoman for the Pennington County Sheriff’s Department, said in a statement the settlement “clarifies that 24-7 Sobriety Program participants who have not paid the court-ordered fees” won’t be incarcerated.
“Instead, individuals who have not paid the 24-7 Program fees may be reported to the courts or supervising authority,” Duhamel said. “Any sanction decisions for nonpayment would be set by the court.”
A judge can look at each case individually to determine if the person who didn’t pay on a given day truly could not afford to, or if they were able to pay and didn’t. Participants can be sanctioned under the latter circumstance, under the terms of the settlement, but not for a legitimate lack of funds. 
The settlement applies to the 37 known members of the class, Leach said, but the class also includes any people who “have been or will in the future be incarcerated in Pennington County, threatened with incarceration or sanctions, based in whole or in part on inability to pay the fees required to participate in the 24-7 Program.” 
The county currently has 352 people in the program.
Other counties, statewide impacts
Lucas Oyler, the program’s former state coordinator, told lawmakers in 2022 that an inability to threaten jail for failure to pay might cause county sheriffs, who administer 24-7 tests, to opt out of participating in the program.
Leach said he doubts that. He said the majority of people who wind up involved in the criminal justice system, even those deemed income-eligible for a court-appointed lawyer, are able to pay $2 a day. 
“But at the same time, there’s a certain group of people who are just poor,” Leach said, in ways that are “far beyond anything” most people have experienced.
‘Treated like a criminal’: Native woman’s death sparks questions

Minnehaha County Sheriff Mike Milstead was among the first sheriffs to use 24-7, and he’s been following the Pennington County lawsuit closely. 
The policy for 24-7 participants in Minnehaha County, he said, is built around an understanding that an inability to pay doesn’t justify an immediate jail stay.
“If a person has been released from jail and ordered by a judge to comply with the 24-7 program as a condition of release but cannot pay,” Milstead wrote in an email to South Dakota Searchlight, “then it is up to the judge to decide whether bond should be revoked, modified, or remain.”
In response to questions from South Dakota Searchlight on how counties ought to proceed in the face of the successful class action lawsuit, Attorney General Marty Jackley issued a statement saying his office intends to let counties decide the right approach.
“While we cannot dictate how an agency operates its program,” Jackley wrote, “we are committed to supporting them in ensuring compliance with state statutes and administrative rules.”
Long, the former attorney general who launched the program, said a case can be made that counties — or even community organizations — would benefit in the long run if they decide to pay 24-7 fees for the indigent, who might be “among the ones who’d most benefit from it.”
Keeping habitual drinkers or drug users sober can reduce visits to the emergency room, Long said, as well as business losses from theft.
“There is some community benefit to keeping these folks sober,” Long said.

Wisconsin lawmakers and Gov. Tony Evers rushed to finish the state budget in July, ahead of federal legislation making it to President Donald Trump’s desk, to ensure the state draw down additional federal funds. Whether the state will be able to benefit from that funding is now uncertain. 
The 2025-27 state budget included a provision to increase its Medicaid hospital assessment from 1.8% to 6% as a way to supplement the state’s Medicaid resources with matching contributions from the federal government. The change was meant to increase payments to hospitals and to offset the state’s funding for the Medical Assistance program. It was estimated to result in over $1 billion in additional revenue for Wisconsin hospitals. 
A Legislative Fiscal Bureau analysis this week found that “preliminary federal guidance from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has created some uncertainty about the allowability of changes to Wisconsin’s hospital assessment.”
29 Marklein Born Revenue Estimates
The analysis said that if the increase is disallowed then it would lead to a general purpose revenue shortfall of $396 million annually — or $792 million in the 2025-27 biennium.
“CMS indicated that this matter will be addressed through formal rule making procedures, and thus will be subject to provisions of notice and public comment. Pending additional information from the federal government, the allowability of the Act 15 changes is not currently known,” the LFB analysis stated. 
A group of eight Democratic state lawmakers, including state Rep. Steve Doyle and Sen. Brad Pfaff, both from Onalaska, sent a letter to U.S. Rep. Derrick Van Orden urging him to take action to help ensure Wisconsin receives the funds. Following the state budget, Van Orden claimed credit for helping secure the extra funds for the state.
“Our hospitals, and especially our rural hospitals were counting on that funding to keep their
doors open… At a time when our medical institutions are facing unprecedented financial challenges, we must do everything we can to ensure their ability to continue to operate. Our state budget was counting on it, and our constituents’ lives literally depend on it. We implore you to do everything in your power to reverse these catastrophic decisions,” the lawmakers wrote.

(Photo courtesy of U.S. Department of Energy/Bechtel)Congress this week approved a $3.2 billion budget for the Hanford nuclear reservation’s cleanup in fiscal 2026 — a more than $200 million increase from the prior two years.
That is more than what the Trump administration originally requested for Hanford, but almost $3 billion less than what Washington officials believe is needed this year to keep the site’s cleanup on its legally mandated timetable. This is also the biggest cleanup budget in Hanford’s history.
President Donald Trump’s budget request allocated slightly less than $400 million to operate Hanford’s biggest project — the new plant to convert the site’s radioactive waste into glass, which began operating in October. 
Congress bumped that budget up to $480 million, according to the office of Washington U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee. 
Murray said in a statement that Thursday’s Senate approval was “a rejection of the Trump administration’s efforts to undermine the Hanford cleanup mission.” 
“We cannot do nuclear waste cleanup on the cheap,” she said. 
The House passed the same budget earlier this month.
Washington’s Department of Ecology calculates that Hanford needs a budget of $6.15 billion to meet all of its legal cleanup obligations for fiscal 2026, and $6.76 billion for fiscal 2027. 
Hanford’s cleanup is governed by an often-litigated and often-changed 35-year-old legal agreement between the state, the U.S. Department of Energy and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
“The federal government has a big job to do cleaning up Hanford,” Gov. Bob Ferguson,  a Democrat, said in a statement. “This budget is a positive step forward in ensuring they live up to their responsibilities.”
“We have made important progress this year. Let’s keep up the momentum,” he added.
Casey Sixkiller, director of the state ecology department, also acknowledged progress with the cleanup in the past year.
“We need to keep funding at a level where we can accelerate the pace of cleanup and reduce the risk of a catastrophic infrastructure collapse or contamination release,” Sixkiller said. “Now is the time for the federal government to double down and not back away from its legal and moral obligations to the people of Washington state. ”
Hanford is arguably the most radioactively contaminated spot in the Western Hemisphere.
The U.S. government set up Hanford in 1943 to create plutonium for the nation’s atomic bombs, including those exploded in New Mexico and over Nagasaki in 1945. That work created many billions of gallons of chemical and radioactive waste.
The worst 56 million gallons of that waste were pumped into 177 underground tanks. About a third of those tanks leak. At least a million gallons of radioactive liquid have leaked into the ground, seeping into the aquifer 200 feet below and then into the Columbia River, roughly seven miles away.
Hanford has just begun converting lesser radioactive wastes in the tanks into a benign glass to be eventually stored at an underground storage site at a still undetermined location. 
A second plant to tackle more radioactive waste could be operating in the 2030s. 
Since the low-activity waste plant will handle only 40-50% of the less radioactive wastes, Hanford recently decided to look into encasing the remaining low-activity materials in a cement-like substance, which would be theoretically faster and cheaper than building a second low-level glassification plant. 
Originally, the legal deadline to finish glassifying all 56 million gallons of tank wastes was 2019. 
Right now, Hanford’s legal target is removing all the waste from 149 single-shell tanks and closing those tanks by 2043, and closing the 28 newer and safer double-shell tanks by 2052. 
The Energy Department has moved those targets back to 2069, a date not reflected in its current cleanup agreements with the state of Washington, according to a 2021 report by the Government Accountability Office.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Hanford-low-activity-waste-facility-containers-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-18 07:56:11.365376

(Photo by Meghan O'Brien/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota must spend $106 million in remaining pandemic relief by the end of the year, or it has to be returned to the federal government.
Most of the funds left to spend are for water and wastewater infrastructure projects, housing, broadband, ambulance upgrades and telemedicine upgrades in nursing homes, according to a Wednesday presentation from the Bureau of Finance and Management at the Capitol in Pierre.
Bureau Commissioner Jim Terwilliger told lawmakers on the budget committee that the state will meet the deadline to “maximize those dollars.”
“We feel like we’re in a good place,” Terwilliger said.
Federal relief and stimulus funding for South Dakota in response to the COVID-19 pandemic included about $974 million from the State Fiscal Recovery Funds authorized by the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. The unspent balance represents about 10% of that funding.


The funding has been transformative in some sectors of the state. South Dakota Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources Secretary Hunter Roberts said during the last legislative session the influx of cash sparked an overdue “water renaissance.”
Roberts’ department has $75 million left to spend on water and sewer projects. Some projects that have used ARPA funding so far include upgrades for the Mni Waste Water Company in western South Dakota, a regional waterline upgrade for the Randall Community Water District in eastern South Dakota, and funding for the Western Dakota Regional Water System study.
The bureau receives quarterly department reports for how funding is spent. As the end of 2026 approaches, any unspent funds will be reallocated to water projects.
About $14 million for workforce housing projects, which is roughly a quarter of that program’s ARPA funding, has not been spent. A mix of federal and state funding was approved by lawmakers in 2022 to help increase South Dakota’s housing stock as the state’s population grows. Roughly $64 million in state-funded loans for workforce housing also remain unobligated, with Gov. Larry Rhoden proposing those state funds be shifted to airport improvement projects, and a legislative task force recommending the money be used for property tax credits.
About $4 million, which is nearly half of the ARPA funding meant to improve emergency medical services across the state, has not been spent, according to the presentation. About $2 million, which is three-quarters of the ARPA funding promised to nursing home telemedicine upgrades, hasn’t been spent yet either. Both grant programs are under the state Department of Health.

It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
The effort of Mississippi House leaders and others to expand programs providing public funds to private schools validates the oft-repeated quote that “history may not repeat itself, but it often rhymes.”
Efforts by Mississippi legislators to send public funds to private schools go back to at least the 1960s.
The current effort, led by House Speaker Jason White and buttressed by President Donald Trump and Gov. Tate Reeves, would provide funds to parents to allow them to help pay for the children’s education at a private school.
The argument is made that such a scheme, sending the money to parents to help pay for their child’s private school education, will not violate Section 208 of the Mississippi Constitution, which states definitively that public money may not go to schools not operating as “free schools.”
The argument is being made that it would be constitutional because the public money is going to the parent instead of the private school. Some would argue that the process is simply trying to achieve through deception what the Mississippi Constitution says is prohibited and, who knows, maybe that is the definition of lawyering.
There have been limited state court cases involving Section 208, and none of those addressed directly the issue of whether providing public funds to a family to be spent on a private school education is constitutional.
It is almost certain that many of the nine members of the Mississippi Supreme Court would prefer not to have to take up the explosive issue. But if the bill passes the Legislature, it is almost certain that it will land in justices’ laps at the state’s highest court.
While it does not appear there has been a state case addressing the particulars that will be in front of the Mississippi Supreme Court if the bill becomes law, in 1969 there was a federal case with similar facts. The U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals struck down a state law sending public funds, called tuition grants, to families to be spent on a private school education.
As the number of Mississippi private schools exploded in the 1960s to provide white students an escape from attending classes with Black students, the Mississippi Legislature passed a bill to provide funds to white students to be used to attend segregationist academies.
Many of those academies still exist today and could benefit if the new effort to provide public funds to private schools becomes law.
The 5th Circuit did not address Section 208 of the Mississippi Constitution, but instead said the law was discriminatory. The 5th Circuit found that the law “encourages, facilitates and supports the establishment of a system of private schools operated on a racially segregated basis as an alternative available to white students seeking to avoid desegregated public schools.”
Granted, 2026 is much different than the 1960s. There are many private schools that enroll and do a good job educating Black students.
But there are still private schools that take great pride in being the sole overseer of their enrollment criteria. The private schools told legislators during a hearing on the issue last year that they would not relinquish their authority to decide who they enroll.
There are, no doubt, private schools that deny enrollment to certain disabled students because of the high cost of providing those children an education.
And, no doubt, there would be private schools that would balk at enrolling gay or trans students. Some private schools also might deny enrollment to students who openly embrace certain religious practices.
Are those forms of discrimination?
In 1969, like today, the executive branch of the federal government got involved in the issue of sending public funds to private schools. The Trump administration has endorsed the bill pending in the Mississippi Legislature.
In 1969 the Justice Department of then-president Richard Nixon opposed the effort to provide “tuition grants” for students to attend private schools.
The opposing positions taken by the two presidents perhaps proves that sometimes history does not repeat itself and doesn’t even rhyme.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/07022545/IMG-3225.jpg,,,2026-01-18 07:56:11.365376

The brave
Marga Camarinta, 15, Manchester Center

I am 4,
and a self-proclaimed 
hero of bravery.

The plane whirs in my ears,
loud and incessant and monstrous,
but I sit as calmly as I can.
Solemn and stoic
is this sugar-stuffed knight.

In this dark, blue light,
in this hollow, titanium titan,
I am illuminated by wonder.

Questions…
questions about a foreign land,
one shrouded in mystery,
with unfamiliar faces.
Like a faraway fantasy,

but tangible to the tips of my small, sticky fingers.

The United States of America:
the land of the free,
and apparently, 
the home of the brave.

Yet so unlike the home I am accustomed to,
and so far away from the ones I love.

But just as this hero feels herself falter
and fall into the mouth of the monster that is her fears,
she is swept up by a warm, wooly embrace,
rescued by her own hero of bravery:
her dazzling, fearless Mom.

The contract lays out a pay schedule that starts with a base wage of $34 an hour, putting the Hinesburg department relatively in line with other Chittenden County police forces.

This story by Briana Brady was first published in The Citizen on Jan. 15, 2026.
The Hinesburg police union, recognized by the town last June, has officially inked a contract with the town of Hinesburg.
The contract, which will go into effect in July, is set to last until June 2029 and outlines a slew of worker protections and benefits along with a step system for annual pay raises. The contract also comes at a time when Hinesburg is oriented toward building back up its police department, both by hiring a chief and filling out its vacant officer positions.
The Hinesburg officers had previously unionized under the Fraternal Order of Police in 2021, but never successfully negotiated a contract. Last year, they organized under the New England Police Benevolent Association and quickly began negotiations, which have been ongoing since the summer.
While contract negotiations inevitably lend some question as to whether pay raises or changes in benefits may impact a budget, according to town manager Todd Odit, the contract signed by the selectboard and union representatives will not change any of the calculations for the police budget as it is currently drafted. The selectboard has been debating increasing the number of budgeted officers from five to six, but the calculation for what each officer might cost will not change.
The contract lays out a pay schedule that starts with a base wage of $34 an hour. This puts the Hinesburg department fairly in line with other Chittenden County towns and their own police forces. According to various job postings, towns range in starting pay from around $30 in Winooski to over $37 in Burlington. That includes a $34 starting wage in Williston and just over $31 an hour in South Burlington.
For departments across Vermont, successful contract negotiations can represent a renewed ability to vie for officers. The state is currently in a police shortage, with active postings in communities across the county that have been open for months or longer. If an officer isn’t happy with their position, it’s not difficult to find another.
Right now, Hinesburg only has three officers, including interim police chief Frank Bryan, of the five it has budgeted. In October, in outlining a departmental case for an increased budget, Bryan advocated to increase the base pay to $36 an hour as well as for additional officers.
“The more we overwork these guys, the more likely they are to say, ‘hey, I can probably make just as much money, if not more money in another town,’” Bryan said. He added that increases to the budget and base pay would not only help the town retain officers, but hire new ones.
There are other elements to the new contract that might be appealing to an incoming officer. For one, there is the possibility for a sign-on bonus of up to $10,000. Additionally, come July, Hinesburg’s officers will have four hours of flexible unpaid leave every month which can be used for things such as attending a child’s parent-teacher conference or bringing an elder to a doctor’s appointment. The officers will also have a labor-management committee to address workplace issues outside of union negotiations.
Along with the budget discussions, this contract is also coming into effect as Hinesburg searches for a new police chief. The town hired consultants to conduct a search for applicants and brought on two community members to give feedback on the process. As of Jan. 7, Odit said the town had entered the second round of interviews with candidates.
Odit has long contended that stable leadership is imperative to attracting and retaining officers. Should a new chief soon be found, in conjunction with the new union contract, the town may be well positioned to start trying to fill out its roster — whether or not the selectboard approves a budget decision that increases the town’s total officer count from five to six.

“If there’s a way I can make a difference, then I want to try,” the nation’s most-decorated cross-country racer says in advance of her fourth and final Olympics.

Many teenagers wallpaper their bedrooms with pinups of hot celebrities. Jessie Diggins, the most-awarded U.S. cross-country skier in history, instead tacked up an “Endless Winter” poster of a less-recognized hero: Vermonter Bill Koch, the first American Nordic racer to win an Olympic medal.
“He looked like he was having fun,” Diggins, who grew up in the Minneapolis-St. Paul suburb of Afton, Minnesota, recently recalled of the athlete-in-action shot. “It was the pure joy of life. That for me is what it’s all about.”
Moving to the Green Mountain State in 2012, a 20-year-old Diggins joined Stratton’s SMS T2 elite training team in hopes of following in Koch’s footsteps.

“I took a blind leap of faith as this young, naive total nobody when I moved out here,” she said in an interview.
Fourteen years later, Diggins — currently ranked the globe’s No. 1 female cross-country skier, with Olympic gold, silver and bronze medals and three overall-season World Cups — is set to wrap up her racing career this March after her fourth and final Winter Games.
“Her world-class engine, her unique combination of fearlessness and vulnerability, and her willingness to tell the world about her frailties is what has made Diggins an icon to plenty of people,” the New York Times wrote in its report on her pending retirement.
For all her stratospheric success, Diggins remains down-to-earth. Take her turn as a de facto cater-waiter when she crushed bags of ice into a beverage tub at a recent $100-a-plate Stratton dinner in her honor.
“This community really took me in,” the 34-year-old said. “I honestly believe this is the best place in the world to train. You feel really supported, and I’m able to get all the things that I need to learn and grow.”
It’s why Diggins keeps finding ways to give back.
‘A whole different story’
Diggins, born in the pre-digital days of 1991, doesn’t have a trope childhood memory of skiing before walking. Instead, she first saw Nordic racing on a VHS tape.
“I’m not going to lie,” she wrote in her 2020 memoir “Brave Enough.” “I wasn’t all that into it.”
Diggins changed her mind when she learned that winners left with a prize.
Joining the Minnesota Youth Ski League at age 3, Diggins ran out of levels to compete in by 10. Worried about juggling homework with practice six days a week, she almost didn’t join the cross-country team in seventh-grade, only to train with the varsity girls and, by her senior year of high school, score straight As and a state championship.
“On the outside, school and sports and dating were going great,” she wrote. “But on the inside, it was a whole different story.”
While classmates saw her as an all-American free spirit and picture of fitness, Diggins — watching her body morph from a girl to a woman — began to eye what she thought was fat. Her memoir recounts her struggle with eating disorders before a family intervention led her to the national Emily Program nonprofit treatment network.
“I’m so lucky to be here and be alive,” she wrote. “This secret, left to its own devices, might have killed me.”

Diggins earned entrance to the U.S. ski team and World Cup racing circuit in 2011, spurring her move to Vermont the next year. Training with Stratton’s SMS T2 crew, she soon found herself alongside one of its founders: Koch, who acquiesced to autographing her childhood poster.
Diggins would compete in the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, Russia, then win U.S. cross-country’s first-ever Olympic gold medal in 2018 in Pyeongchang, South Korea, and a silver (after a bout of food poisoning) and bronze in 2022 in Beijing, China.
In World Cup racing, Diggins became the first American woman to score the season Nordic title in 2021 (Koch became the first U.S. man to do so in 1982) and repeated the feat in 2023 and 2025.
Headed back to the Olympics, Diggins is plugging into social media to connect with fans in her home state of Minnesota, training site in Vermont and Boston suburb where she lives with her husband, financial analyst Wade Poplawski, in Massachusetts.
The skier happily lays claim to them all.
“I’ve been welcomed and adopted by all these different states,” she said. “It’s triple the love.”
‘I have a much bigger platform’
Diggins has yet to announce what she’ll do upon retiring after this March’s World Cup finals in Lake Placid, New York, although she’s noted a desire to start a family and already has after-hours partnerships with the Emily Program, the climate-advocating Protect Our Winters and the ski-instructing Share Winter Foundation.
For several summers, Diggins has joined the Bill Koch Youth Ski League for a fundraising hike up Stratton Mountain. Asked this past August for her biggest challenge, she told students about the 50-kilometer skate at last year’s world championship in Trondheim, Norway.
“I came in as a heavy medal favorite,” she recalled. “There were a lot of cameras and lights and pressure on me.”
Three minutes into the long race, she lagged behind a large field of competitors and realized she wasn’t going to win.
“I had to make a difficult decision. Do I drop out? Do I make some sort of excuse? Or do I finish because I love what I do?”
Determined to continue, Diggins pushed forward for the next two hours and 40 minutes.
“It was the hardest thing I’d ever done, but it was a really good experience,” she said of her 22nd-place finish. “When you win a race, you don’t really learn a whole lot, but when you lose, you get a chance to reexamine: Is this still fun? Do I still love training?”
In that moment, Diggins answered affirmatively, propelling her into this current end-on-a-high-note season.
“Sometimes,” she told students, “having a really, really bad day is what you need to continue to have good days.”

After Covid limited crowds at the 2022 Olympics, Diggins is set to travel with her family, friends and trademark face glitter to next month’s Winter Games in Italy. But she’s less interested in the destination than the journey there.
“You really have to enjoy the process of what you’re doing every day, because even if you win, the award ceremony will last 10 minutes — and it’ll be the best 10 minutes of your life — and then it will be over,” she said. “If you don’t love working hard, improving, and everything else that goes into it and you get out of it, then winning isn’t going to change your life.”
That’s why Diggins focuses on the present rather than the future.
“In racing, I want to cross the finish line and look back and say, ‘I used this chance and I gave it my all. That’s the approach I have with advocacy, too. I have a much bigger platform, and I’ve found myself thinking, ‘I have to do something with this.’ If there’s a way I can make a difference, then I want to try.”

Although overall town populations in Stowe, Morristown and Elmore have increased over the last decade, school enrollment has declined by 10% since 2017, according to a new study.

This story by Patrick Bilow was first published in News & Citizen on Jan. 15, 2026.
A study commissioned by the Lamoille South Supervisory Union predicts that school enrollments in Stowe, Morristown and Elmore will decline 10% by the 2030 school year, reflecting trends in rural towns throughout Vermont as the state ages and grows increasingly expensive.
At recent Stowe and Elmore-Morristown school board meetings, Lamoille South Supervisory Union Superintendent Ryan Heraty introduced the study to school board members and explained how the supervisory union might react to a slow enrollment decline over the next four years.
The study was produced by the Boston firm Statistical Forecasting LLC. In 2021, the supervisory union hired the New England Development Council to conduct a similar study, but the results were largely rejected due to controversial options for utilizing Lamoille South’s eight buildings, including shuttering some of them and rerouting students to different locations.
Heraty said the new report is focused more narrowly on student population and doesn’t make recommendations. Enrollment trends in local schools are frequently referenced in housing and affordability discussions throughout Lamoille County, particularly in Stowe, and the Stowe School board wanted a study that dovetails with the Town of Stowe’s Housing Needs Assessment.
“With all of the statewide discussion around consolidation and thinking about Vermont’s overall demographic trends, leaning towards an aging population, declining student enrollments — all of that — we want to think more local,” Heraty said. “How is this going to impact our schools here? And what do we see around housing trends that are going to impact our kindergarten, first and second grade enrollments so that we can start preparing for the future?”
Although overall town populations in Stowe, Morristown and Elmore have increased over the last decade, and are expected to increase in the future, according to the study, school enrollments in those towns have declined by 10%, from 1,592 in 2016 to 1,406 this year, after peaking at 1,694 students in 2017.
Throughout the Lamoille South Supervisory Union, kindergarten through fifth-grade classrooms have experienced the largest decline over the last eight years. Enrollment for that age group is currently at 544, a decrease of 132 students since 2016. According to the study, school enrollment for that age group is expected to dip over the next three years before leveling out at this year’s figure by 2030.
Enrollment for grades 6-8 has held relatively steady, declining by just 48 students over the last eight years, but that figure is expected to decline another 65 students by 2030.
High school enrollment district-wide has swung by nearly 100 students over the last eight years, ranging from 497 to 589, but figures for 2016 and 2025 are nearly even at 521 and 515, respectively. By 2030, that high school enrollment is expected to decline 12%.
While the study illustrated what many in Lamoille County’s housing and affordability circle already recognize — that a lack of viable housing and declining homestead rates are impacting local school enrollments — members of the Stowe school board said they aren’t necessarily concerned about declining enrollment.
“In my experience, it’s not unusual to see these ups and downs,” Stowe School Board Chair Tiffany Donza said.
In Stowe and Morristown, atypically large high school classes are currently graduating, inflating enrollment trends over the last few years, but elementary school enrollment has been low, partially explaining a projected enrollment decline by 2030 as those students move through the school system.
Prior to Act 60 and Act 68, both of which imposed a new funding formula for Vermont schools, Donza said enrollment wasn’t as much of a consideration. But the new formula started rewarding districts with more students and schools started watching their numbers closely, Donza said.
“It made it so students come with dollars,” Donza said, “Which is a disadvantage to Stowe for so many reasons.”
To understand enrollment trends, Heraty pointed to the median age of a community, saying those small elementary school classes coming up are indicative of greater housing and affordability issues facing families.
According to the study by Statistical Forecasting LLC, a housing boom from 1990 to 2009 benefitted a younger median age group who were moving to town. But as that group ages, and their children graduate, housing development has rapidly declined, and the median age has increased.
From 2000 to 2009, 1,207 homes were built in the Lamoille South Supervisory Union, almost twice as many as the next decade. From 2010 to 2020, there were only 666 homes built, according to the study. Stowe’s grand list has also increased significantly and the homestead rate has declined.
“The problem isn’t demand; it’s availability of affordable housing,” Heraty said. “It’s really hard to be in a position where you know that people want to be here and they want to live in our communities, but the housing just doesn’t exist for them.”
While Heraty is not sounding the alarm of declining enrollment, the Lamoille South Supervisory Union has begun making subtle changes to respond to the trend.
The supervisory union has already reduced central office positions and will reduce support staff positions this year.
“We don’t need to look at this as a negative,” Donza said. “We just need to plan for it and properly staff the schools.”

Jeff Landry now has to balance his duties as Louisiana's governor with his new role as President Donald Trump's special envoy to Greenland. (Photo by Hilary Scheinuk/The Advocate, Pool)Most of Jeff Landry’s predecessors as Louisiana governor never saw the need for a side hustle. For them, running the state was more than enough of a job. 
But Landry has made it clear he doesn’t want to be like other governors. His chutzpah might have been why the governor felt comfortable asking President Donald Trump to name him special envoy to Greenland on top of his duties overseeing Louisiana. 
Trump has made increasingly charged remarks in recent days about the United States taking control of Greenland, a self-ruling territory in the Kingdom of Denmark. In response, several European countries have announced their support for Greenland, with some launching military exercises to back up their stance. 

To what extent it is practical for the governor of Louisiana to be involved with the sensitive, international negotiations over Greenland that have much of Europe on edge while also managing one of the neediest states in the country remains to be seen.
“Most of us in Louisiana would think he is supposed to have a full-time job already,” said Terry Ryder, who served as general counsel for former Govs. Mike Foster and Kathleen Blanco and worked for former Govs. Buddy Roemer and Bobby Jindal. 

“Having been with multiple administrations, four administrations, there is always way more to do than any one governor can do,” Ryder said. 
Foreign affairs experts agreed it could be challenging for Landry to hold both roles at the same time. Special envoys, particularly ones handling high-profile issues for the White House, are often expected to devote their full attention to their assignment, they said. 
“Anytime you have two jobs, you are probably not doing either of them very well,” said Barbara Bodine, a former U.S. ambassador to Yemen who is now the director of the Institute for the Study of Diplomacy at Georgetown University. 
“It is going to take a lot of his time out of state,” Bodine said of the envoy position. “There is no way you can be governor of Louisiana by Zoom.”
Landry’s staff declined to answer almost all questions emailed to them last week about the governor’s role as special envoy, including one regarding concerns the position could distract from his job as governor.

How much time will Landry spend on Greenland? His staff won’t say.
Landry isn’t being paid for his work as special envoy, his state staff said. But how much energy he will spend on Greenland isn’t clear.
Landry went to Washington, D.C., Thursday to participate in discussions that included the Trump administration, members of Congress and emissaries from Greenland and Denmark. He has also appeared in person on national television shows to talk about Greenland during a New York trip earlier this month. 
The governor’s office would not provide an estimate for how many hours Landry expects to spend per month on his Greenland role or to what extent he would be traveling for those duties.
Questions about whether Landry will receive federal staff or a D.C. office for his envoy role went unanswered by the governor’s staff. The U.S. Department of State and the White House press offices also didn’t answer questions about the federal resources Landry might receive. 
Foreign diplomacy experts said there are no set rules for an envoy, including whether the role is done on a part- or full-time basis. Historically, presidents have used special envoys because the positions allow for that type of flexibility. 
“It can be full time for a while, and then there is a pause in negotiations, and the envoy goes back to whatever they were doing before and just keeps a watchful eye on the matter,” James Bishop, a former U.S. ambassador to Nigeria, Liberia and Somalia, said in an interview. 
Given Trump’s intense focus on Greenland, however, foreign policy experts said Landry, as special envoy, would normally receive some federal staff support at the U.S. State Department on a temporary basis.

Landry would also be expected to make negotiations over Greenland his top priority while the discussions are taking place, the experts said.

“A sitting governor who intends to keep his day job is unusual, to say the least, because one of the reasons that you have a special envoy is that you have an issue that is meddlesome, and you need to find somebody who can focus on that issue to try to resolve it,” said Bodine, who teaches about the role of special envoys in one of her classes at Georgetown.

In recent history, Bill Richardson is the only other governor who had a strong hand in foreign affairs while holding his state office. The Democrat worked as a “freelance diplomat” to get American hostages released while leading New Mexico from 2003-11, although he was never designated a special envoy for the president during that time. 

Unlike Landry, Richardson had significant experience in foreign relations before he became governor. He first helped free an American hostage in 1994 during a trip to North Korea that he took as a New Mexico congressman, and he served as President Bill Clinton’s ambassador to the United Nations in 1997-98.

Landry says he wants Greenland deals for Louisiana 
While no connection between Greenland and Louisiana is apparent, it hasn’t stopped Landry from trying to make one with the arctic island. 

“They tell me they like to hunt, they like to fish, they like to have a good time. I’m like, ‘Y’all belong in Louisiana,’” Landry said on the Brian Kilmeade Show on Fox News Radio this month. 

The governor has also taken great pains, even on national broadcasts, to say he will use his role as special envoy to Greenland to create business investment for Louisiana. 

“I can’t wait to have discussions with Greenland about the opportunities that we can do in Louisiana,” Landry said during an appearance on CNBC Squawk Box.
The Louisiana Economic Development agency, which is run by a Landry appointee, is not actively working on business deals in Greenland but would welcome those types of projects, according to a spokeswoman. 
“[W]e are excited about the future opportunities that Governor Landry’s new role brings,” Emma Wagner said for the agency in a written statement. 
Talk of mixing Louisiana’s business with his special envoy duties alarmed foreign policy experts interviewed for this story. They said the governor using a diplomatic role abroad to gin up investment for the state would create ethical concerns and possibly run afoul of federal law. 
“It could get messy if, for example, any company that has an office, much less a headquarters, in Louisiana that would benefit from mining, refining or shipping,” Bodine said. 
There have also been questions about whether Landry might be violating a Louisiana constitutional law that prohibits public officials from holding federal and state jobs at the same time. But Ryder, who worked for four governors as an attorney, said he doubts Landry’s unpaid role will raise concerns.

“I would say the less formal it is, the safer it is for him,” Ryder said. “There is nothing wrong with a governor helping the president of the United States.” 
Whether Landry’s Greenland assignment will be popular with Louisiana voters is another matter. Former Gov. Bobby Jindal saw his polling numbers tank while he started traveling frequently to raise money and generate support for his 2016 presidential campaign. 

Bernie Pinsonat, a Louisiana political consultant and polling expert, doubts Louisiana voters have paid much attention to the governor’s Greenland job. Landry’s approval ratings are already low, standing at 39% according to one recent poll, but won’t necessarily sink further because of the special envoy job, he said.

“I’ll guarantee you that if [Louisiana voters] think he’s too involved in national politics versus what he’s doing here, believe me, he’ll suffer,” the pollster said. “But I don’t think he’s anywhere near that.”",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/BR.specialsession.110724_HS_1722-1024x998.jpg,,,2026-01-18 06:56:56.816249

Winthrop Rockefeller was the only Southern governor to hold a public memorial following the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination.
The indelible image of a white governor joining hands with Black mourners to sing “We Shall Overcome” was needed to heal a city that was just a couple hours away from where King was killed.
The moment was also a reminder of how Arkansas shines the best when its leaders find ways to highlight the importance of civil rights rather than shy away. Arkansas needs to find more avenues to do so, even in a hyperpartisan environment.
The state’s move nearly a decade ago to remove Robert E. Lee’s name from the state holiday honoring King was a step in the right direction. The joint holiday honoring the civil rights icon alongside the Confederate general had become an embarrassment for the state, especially as pictures of the state notices about the joint holiday gained traction on social media.
That embarrassment was enough for Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson to add the issue to his legislative agenda and take the rare step of testifying before a legislative committee in favor of it.
The state has made other signs of progress, at least symbolically. 
The decision to replace one of the state’s statues in the U.S. Capitol with one of Daisy Bates, the civil rights leader who mentored the nine students who integrated Central High School, was a necessary statement to be made in a building where statues of Confederate leaders can still be found.

A lesser but still significant step was taken by Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders signing legislation creating a specialty license plate honoring the Central High historic site.
But elsewhere there have been stumbles and missed opportunities. That includes the effort to no longer honor the Confederacy with one of the stars on Arkansas’ flag, a proposal that failed before a legislative committee. Similarly, a bid to end the state’s commemoration of “Confederate Flag Day” passed the House in 2021 but failed before a Senate panel.
The current political climate isn’t encouraging for another attempt at these measures. President Donald Trump has defended Confederate figures and symbols, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has taken moves to restore the names of Confederate generals to military bases.
Sanders has echoed Trump’s rhetoric complaining about “indoctrination” in the classroom, with a law she signed prohibiting critical race theory from being taught in public schools that’s sparked a legal fight. The prohibition has also drawn criticism from civil rights groups who say the restriction threatens to whitewash history. A federal appeals court panel last year allowed the law to be enforced in the state. 
Arkansas is running out of opportunities to properly honor that history instead of engaging in fights over it. Many of the leaders and key figures of the Civil Rights Movement are gone, including Claudette Colvin, who died last week. Two of the Little Rock Nine have died, leaving only seven of those civil rights icons left. 
Next year marks 70 years since the Little Rock desegregation crisis, and it may be one of the last times that an anniversary can be commemorated with most of the Little Rock Nine on hand. The sad truth is that despite the symbolic progress that’s been made, Arkansas remains a state where symbols and monuments of the Confederacy significantly outnumber tributes to the state’s civil rights icons.
It’s easy to echo talking points about heritage and much harder to admit that true patriotism requires embracing a full history. It requires elevating civil rights heroes, and acknowledging a country and state’s shameful past. 
Finding a way to do so in this environment might be the best monument.

The Legislature will reconvene for a three-day special session on Wednesday. (Photo by Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota lawmakers plan to hold a three-day special session starting Wednesday, but it’s still unclear if they’ll discuss any bills other than five focused on the federal Rural Health Transformation Program.
Legislative leaders will decide Tuesday afternoon if additional bills will be allowed. That means the public will have a tight window to provide input on potential legislation. Gov. Kelly Armstrong will deliver a State of the State address at 10 a.m. Wednesday.
What we know
At least five bills will be introduced, focused on the federal rural health care funding, the reason Armstrong called the special session. One is an appropriations bill to approve spending $199 million of federal funding this year and authorizing $200 million anticipated for next year. A hearing is set for 10:30 a.m. Wednesday.
Four health policy bills also will be introduced. The one likely to get the most debate would expand the prescriptive authority of pharmacists, which proponents say could make it easier for rural North Dakotans to get treated for common conditions. A hearing for that bill is scheduled for 1 p.m. Wednesday. 

North Dakota Monitor special session coverage

Lawmakers also will consider a bill that would require K-12 students to take the presidential fitness test; a bill to require one-hour of continuing education for doctors related to healthy eating; and a bill to include physician assistants in a state licensure compact.
Hearings on those policy bills are scheduled between 10:30 a.m. and 1 p.m. Wednesday. For specific information, including links to submit written testimony, visit the committee hearing schedule. Some written testimony is due as early as 9:30 a.m. Wednesday.
Lawmakers also will accept public testimony in person and online, though they prioritize in-person testimony.
Lawmakers are proposing the policy bills in order to fulfill criteria for additional federal funding through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid’s grant application process. Sen. Brad Bekkedahl, R-Williston, warned any substantial modifications to those bills come with the risk of losing some of the state’s $199 million grant. 
“If any of those four policy bills do not pass in the form that we have them, or if they’re significantly changed from the form that CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) wanted us to draft as policies, then we could see reductions in funding or clawbacks of that funding,” said Bekkedahl, who will co-chair a joint Appropriations Committee during the special session. 


What we don’t know
The Legislative Management committee will meet at 1 p.m. Tuesday to hear pitches from lawmakers about other legislation for the special session. Lawmakers will have five minutes to explain their bill draft and why it’s an emergency that can’t wait until 2027.
We don’t know all of the topics that could be addressed. Those bill drafts are expected to become public on the legislative website on Monday on the Legislative Management meeting agenda.
One bill that will be pitched during that meeting is a proposal to provide free school meals to all K-12 students, similar to a ballot measure that’s circulating. It will be up to the bipartisan committee of legislative leaders to decide if the bill advances to the full Legislature on Wednesday.
If the committee does not advance a bill, a lawmaker could still attempt to introduce it from the Senate or House floor. The bill would need support from at least two-thirds of the members to be introduced.
How the public can participate
All legislative proceedings, including the governor’s speech, are open to the public and livestreamed on the legislative website.

Affordable, quality child care is one of the smartest investments we can make as a state. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Emilie Tenenbaum and Sharron Harrington: Why Vermont must stay committed to child care.","This commentary is by Emilie Tenenbaum, the executive director of Let’s Grow Kids Action Network, and Sharron Harrington, the executive director of the Vermont Association for the Education of Young Children.
Across political lines and communities, most Vermonters agree that young families should be able to afford to live and work here. 
The good news is that the long-term investments in child care arising from Act 76 (Vermont’s landmark child care law passed in 2023) are moving us toward this shared vision. 
Early childhood connects to many of Vermont’s biggest policy challenges, from affordability to school readiness. We know that investing in quality child care leads to better results down the road, including improved health outcomes and higher graduation and employment rates. 
Since 2023, Vermont’s bold investments in child care access and affordability have begun to reshape what’s possible. 
In the last two years, more than 5,000 additional children and their families have accessed tuition assistance to help pay for quality child care. Over 100 new child care programs have opened, creating 1,700 new spaces for children and 400 new early childhood educator jobs. 
Parents tell us these changes have helped them afford to stay in Vermont, participate in the workforce, and start or grow their families. Investing in child care delivers results that every Vermont policymaker wants to see and that Vermonters deserve.
It’s essential that lawmakers stay committed to investments proven to work. To put it bluntly: while our momentum is real, continued progress is not guaranteed unless our state remains committed to child care. 
That’s why we are focused this year on the following policy priorities: protecting the child care funding driving Vermont’s success; strengthening our early childhood educator workforce; increasing child care access and affordability; and fixing delays in fingerprinting and background checks, which are critical for safety and staffing. 
Together, our organizations represent more than a decade of statewide coalition building. Our recommendations come from ongoing engagement with families, early childhood educators, employers and partners.
First and foremost, we must protect the funding driving these systems-level improvements. Act 76 created more than $100 million in long-term public investment, which was supported by Vermont businesses and citizens because they recognize that affordable, quality child care is one of the smartest investments we can make as a state. 
The numbers show it’s paying off. As lawmakers craft the budget for fiscal year 2027, funding for child care must not be diverted.
The continued success of our child care commitment depends on strengthening and growing our early childhood educator workforce. Children have better outcomes in school and beyond when their earliest experiences are supported by a qualified early childhood educator.
Expanding access for children only happens when there are enough qualified early childhood educators to care for them. The best way to do this is to establish professional recognition for early childhood educators. 
The Early Childhood Educator Profession Bill (introduced as S.206) creates professional recognition for more than 6,500 educators working in child care programs outside our public schools. 
It is workforce-informed, workforce-strengthening legislation that addresses regulatory gaps and creates a transparent, supportive system for parents, educators, hiring programs and the public. It connects educators’ accountability and compensation to their qualifications — just like any other profession.
It professionalizes a workforce without which our state cannot function, and it does so while supporting, rather than displacing, the talented educators already doing the work. 
As we work toward accessible, affordable, quality child care for every family that needs it, we’ll continue to advocate for improvements. For some families earning more than the tuition assistance threshold, affordable child care still remains out of reach.
Meanwhile, measures improving child care quality are clearly working. Programs helping early childhood educators earn credentials and degrees are extremely popular; training, coaching, and targeted supports are improving child care quality statewide. 
Lawmakers must continue to increase access, lower costs, improve quality, and expand programs that help recruit and retain educators — especially in rural regions and for families with unique needs, like nonstandard work hours.
They also need to fix Vermont’s fingerprint and background check delays. Child safety depends on efficient, thorough criminal background checks for anyone working in child care. The current lengthy delays worsen staffing shortages across child care and afterschool programs. 
Vermont’s commitment to child care is a source of statewide pride. We must protect and strengthen that commitment: keep growing child care programs, keep strengthening our early childhood educator workforce, and keep improving outcomes for children, families, and our economy. 
Vermont’s future depends on what we do next.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-18 10:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"As CT speed cameras bring in millions and more towns sign up, concerns linger",Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/18/ct-speed-camera-locations/,"Eleven CT towns have OK'd speed cameras, and they report traffic is slowing down. But some concerns linger about privacy issues.","Drivers who speed down Route 66 on the border of Middletown and Middlefield are getting hit with an automatic $50 fine. The second time they’re caught in a month costs $75. 
Middletown is one of the first municipalities in Connecticut to install speed cameras in town — but it won’t be the last. After the Connecticut legislature passed a law in 2023 allowing municipalities to install red light and speed cameras and collect fines from drivers who break the law, cities and towns have been presenting extensive plans to the state Department of Transportation in bids to procure their own monitoring devices. So far, 11 have had plans approved and three more are under consideration.
The 2023 law says that municipalities can install cameras that will capture drivers who speed and run red lights. After an initial 30-day period of written warnings, drivers who drive more than 10 mph over the speed limit or run a red light will be issued a fine. 
According to the Middletown police, the area on Route 66 near the camera is a hotspot for speeders. The limit is 35 mph, but the police have caught drivers going more than twice as fast. 
Middletown Police Chief Erik Costa said he would need significantly more police officers to catch as many people speeding as the camera was able to. He said it has also “changed the culture” of driving in that part of the city, where there are multiple apartment buildings and large retail stores. 

Towns that want to install speed cameras have to create plans that include quite a bit of information, including data on traffic stops and crashes in the areas where the proposed cameras would be installed. 
According to Middletown’s plan, the police department made 455 traffic stops over the last three years in the area on Route 66 where the camera was to be located.
From the time the camera went live in July through December 2025, the department issued about 46,000 citations for the same area. As of early December, the department had collected $1.84 million in fines out of a total of $2.8 million issued, according to Costa. 
“ The force multiplier that the cameras take care of is tremendous,” Costa said. 
Costa said the cameras have allowed him to send his police officers to patrol other “hot spots” in town. 
The town recently installed two more traffic cameras, near Spencer and Moody elementary schools. Costa said the areas near those schools have no lighting or stop signs for controlling traffic. The roads slope downward and the intersections are at odd angles, making the cameras necessary. 
“ We really are focused on maintaining good speeds in that area so we don’t have any tragedy and especially during the transition of our buses and family pickup for students,” he said.

‘The only thing … that has actually worked’
So far, the state has approved traffic cameras in 11 municipalities — New Haven, Middletown, Washington, Beacon Falls, Marlborough, Milford, Stratford, Fairfield, Greenwich, Stamford and Wethersfield. 
The municipality of Washington, a town in Litchfield County with a population of about 3,600 in 2021, was the first to install cameras. The plan submitted to the state said because Washington shares a resident state trooper with surrounding towns, the town needs additional resources in order to enforce traffic laws.  
Richard Inniamo, Washington’s resident state trooper, said in early December that the town’s three cameras had issued upwards of 13,400 citations since May of last year. 
“People are slowing down for them, and that’s all we really wanted,” Inniamo said. He added that where people used to travel more than 20 mph over the speed limit, they are now staying within 10 mph to 15 mph of the speed limit. 
According to Jim Bretton, Washington’s first selectman, in early December the town had collected roughly 75% of the $662,000 it has issued in fines. Bretton agreed with Inniamo that the cameras have slowed down drivers. He said citations peaked in June, a month after the cameras were installed. Since then, the number has dropped.  
“Honestly, it’s the only thing to date that has actually worked,” Bretton said, adding that the town had tried installing speed bumps, and offering more education, to no avail. 
Bretton said the town saw the cameras as a way to improve pedestrian safety, a top concern.
“As a rural community, we’ve got people out constantly with their children with their pets walking the roads. It was virtually every road was a speedway,” he said. 
Data from Marlborough shows that the two cameras installed on North Main Street caught 8,600 speeding events between July and December 2025 and issued 6,500 citations. According to a presentation that Town Manager David Porter gave to the Capitol Region Council of Governments, the percentage of people driving over the speed limit dropped significantly when the cameras were installed and continued to drop over the course of the first few months they were active.

“Speed cameras have been enormously successful at making that road much safer,” Porter told the Board of Selectmen at a meeting on Dec. 16. 
But Porter also said that state rules requiring the data to be erased after 30 days made it difficult to keep track of repeat offenders. He said he would like to see the time limit increased to 60 or 90 days. 
So far, he said, the town has collected $186,924 after paying fees to the camera vendor. 
The towns have contracted with a variety of vendors to provide the cameras and software. A purchase order from August 2024 shows that Middletown paid about $3,900 to the firm Traffic Logix for a speed camera. The town paid $4,000 to Dacra Tech for the camera’s operating system and will also pay the firm a monthly fee based on the number of citations and warnings issued: $13.50 per citation and $6 per warning. 
Costa said the cost of the speed cameras will be funded by fees from violations. Under the 2023 law, fees collected from traffic violations must go either toward paying for the speed and red light cameras or toward transportation infrastructure.
Privacy concerns
Privacy concerns have been raised, not only with the use of red light and speed cameras but with all surveillance technology.
Late last year, the ACLU called for a temporary ban on automatic license plate readers out of concerns the information the devices collect could be used by federal agents for immigration enforcement or to penalize people seeking abortions or transgender care. 
Although Connecticut’s law strictly regulates the way data collected by speed and red light cameras can be used, Dan Barrett, the legal director of the ACLU of Connecticut, said the organization is concerned about their use. 
“The pervasive surveillance means that so much more evil is possible,” Barrett said. 
State law mandates that any data collected by speed or red light cameras can only be used to track those violations. It can’t be used, for example, to track someone who has committed a crime. 
Still, some municipal officials, while assessing the need for the cameras, have expressed concerns about potential collateral effects.
In September, the town of East Hartford approved a detailed ordinance regulating all surveillance technologies, including license plate readers, speed and red light cameras and drones. Don Bell, the town council vice chair, said at the council’s September meeting that the strict state regulations around speed and red light camera data helped quell his fears that the program might overcharge or discriminate against certain residents. 
Still, he said, he felt some “discomfort” about the use of the devices.
“We know that surveillance technology, good intentions or not, often disproportionately impacts communities of color. As one of the most diverse communities in the state, throughout this process I’ve worried if I might unintentionally hurt East Hartford by supporting any ordinance that opens the door for new technology,” Bell said. 
The ordinance places regulations around surveillance cameras that are similar to the ones the state places on speed and red light cameras, limiting the way the data can be used and how long it can be kept. The ordinance also prohibits the use of facial recognition technology. 
The town has not yet proposed installing any red light or speed cameras. 
People who receive citations are able to contest them and ask for a hearing. There are six valid reasons under the law for overturning violations: if a traffic light was broken, a driver had to get out of the way of an emergency vehicle, a driver was directed to ignore the traffic light by an officer, the camera was calibrated incorrectly, the vehicle in question had been stolen or the vehicle was an emergency vehicle. 
The citations are civil violations, meaning that drivers will not receive points on their licenses, and the violations will not be reported to insurance companies. 
New Haven
Connecticut’s largest cities have also started to invest in the technology. 
The New Haven town council voted in November to approve a contract with the firm NovoaGlobal to install traffic cameras. The city applied to install 19 red light and speed cameras at various intersections. The state Department of Transportation approved 15 of the 19 requested. 
Overall, New Haven was the site of 20,000 crashes between 2020 and 2022, including about 250 in which someone was seriously injured and 58 in which someone was killed, according to the plan New Haven submitted to DOT.
Several of the sites the city chose for the cameras were locations where pedestrians had been struck and killed by motor vehicles in the last five years. 
At one of the intersections, where Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd crosses Church Street, more than 70 crashes occurred between 2020 and 2022. In 2024, a bicyclist was hit by a garbage truck and killed at the intersection, and a pedestrian was injured during a crash in which one vehicle ran a red light. 
Mayor Justin Elicker said the traffic cameras were one tool in a larger plan to curb traffic accidents in New Haven. He said the city has doubled the number of officers assigned to traffic enforcement and is installing speed bumps and modifying roads to slow drivers down. The city is also installing cameras on school buses that record drivers passing buses when they’re stopped. 
“In general, there’s still dangerous driving, but we have seen a lot of progress overall in the city,” Elicker said. 
Elicker said the cameras were an advantage not just because they were able to monitor traffic 24/7 but because certain intersections made it difficult for a police officer to pull someone over even if the officer happened to witness a violation. 
“ The cameras are not just helpful to have more enforcement eyes on the street but also to keep our officers and community members safe,” Elicker said. 
Hartford
While the state has not yet approved its application, the Hartford city council voted in November in favor of a plan to install traffic cameras at 11 locations near schools in the city.
According to the proposal the city submitted to the state Department of Transportation, multiple pedestrians had been killed at the potential camera site on Main Street near S.A.N.D. Academy in the past two years. Other potential locations were places where drivers had put students at risk, like at the Parkville Community School. 
“School staff report that students crossing Park Street near New Park Avenue have experienced near misses with speeding drivers,” the report noted. 
In an area on Wethersfield Avenue near Burr Middle School and Bulkeley High School, more than 100 crashes had taken place within the prior three years, according to the proposal.   
Hartford Mayor Arunan Arulampalam told CT Mirror that the city saw the 11 cameras as a pilot program. He said that focusing on the schools would improve multiple neighborhoods across the city and prioritize the safety of children. 
“ I’ve heard time and time again from families about the toll that reckless driving has taken. And as we all know, it’s gotten so much worse after COVID,” he said. “ We want to be able to have residents feel safe in every neighborhood that they’re in across the city and driving is clearly a major public safety concern.” 
“I think actually that [the cameras] will disproportionately help victims of color, and I think we’re going to find a mix of folks from outside of Hartford who are perpetuating many of these traffic violations,” he said. 
Bridgeport
Other cities remain skeptical. On Jan. 6, members of the Bridgeport city council’s Public Safety Committee gathered to hear a presentation raising the possibility of installing speed cameras at several intersections in the city. 
Councilwoman Maria Valle said her goddaughter had been struck at an intersection on East Main Street. She told the Connecticut Mirror that she supported the idea of speed cameras because “something’s got to give.” She mentioned flowers that would appear at intersections, signifying that someone had been killed there.  
“If it’s going to help our residents, why not?” she said. 
But others said they wanted to see the money used to bolster resources that were already suffering from funding shortages in the city. 
“ We are in a place right now that we don’t even have officers to solve crime,” said councilwoman Eneida Martinez, who questioned whether the city would have enough personnel to monitor the cameras, as well as the drones the city has approved to alert law enforcement and first responders to emergencies. 
Constance Vickers, the mayor’s deputy chief of staff, told the council members that she felt the cameras would improve safety.
“ I live right on one of these intersections. I see accidents every day. I walked to work through one of them,” she said.

Slowing people down
It may be too soon to say whether the municipal cameras have reduced the number of vehicular fatalities in the state.
The Connecticut Transportation Institute at the University of Connecticut found that last year, 270 traffic-related deaths were recorded across the state. That was a notable drop from the previous three years, where deaths ranged from 308 to 366 people. 
Eric Jackson, the institute’s executive director, said there had been a renewed focus among police departments on ticketing speeders and aggressive drivers. 
“It could just be the talk of automated enforcement has people slowing down,” Jackson said. 
While the number of drivers and passengers in vehicles who were killed was lower in 2025 compared to previous years, the number of pedestrians who died in crashes remained relatively consistent.
Jackson said the numbers reflect a nationwide trend of pedestrian deaths increasing over the last decade, a trend bolstered by increased aggressive driving during the pandemic. He said the crashes have become more deadly for pedestrians as average vehicle sizes increase. 
Speed cameras can lead to improved safety at particular hot spots, Jackson said. He said cities and towns should also be thinking about road infrastructure, providing wide crosswalks, installing poles and bump-out curbs and making sure there is enough lighting. 
In 2023, the state Department of Transportation ran a pilot program placing speed cameras at five work zones. The program issued more than 24,900 warning notices but issued fewer than 750 fines.

“Based on the results of the pilot, and what we heard directly from the men and women on these job sites, yes, the pilot was a success. Speeds dropped and workers felt safer when these devices were active,” Josh Morgan, spokesperson for the department, said in an email.

If you’re like most people, you’d do it. And you’d keep doing it, at the urging of that authority figure, despite the howls of pain from the poor sap on the other side of the wall.
You’ve probably heard of the Milgram experiment, in which a Yale psychologist faked electric shocks to study the willingness of ordinary people to obey orders in conflict with their personal conscience. Nobody was really hurt, because no shocks were delivered and the yowls of pain came from actors. We’ll return to Milgram shortly, but let me explain how I got to thinking about the famous experiment in the first place.
It was Gov. Laura Kelly’s last State of the State address, delivered Tuesday.
“Kansans are the most civil, decent people on earth,” she declared.
I couldn’t agree more. But our nature is part of the problem.
Kelly, a Democrat, was trying to make a point about civility and bipartisanship in politics. She urged Kansas lawmakers, the supermajority of whom were Republicans, not to let the loudest and most extreme viewpoints “drown out the voices of the vast majority of Kansans, who want to see us work together.”
Problem is, the Legislature has ignored what the vast majority of Kansans want for years — and right-wing extremism already rules. That’s why we don’t have legalized pot or Medicaid expansion. About 65% of Kansans support recreational marijuana, and 74% think expanding Medicaid would help rural hospitals stay in business. Those figures are from the Fall 2025 Kansas Speaks public opinion survey by the Docking Institute for Public Affairs at Fort Hays State University.
Much of the daylight between what Kansans want and what we get is because of historic GOP majorities in the Kansas House and Senate, which routinely block any measure that might give joy or comfort to anybody but the rich. But some of the blame belongs to a collective culture in which Kansans are so desperate to be polite and cooperative, and not to be regarded as different, that we’ll defer to power even when we shouldn’t.
Not all Kansans are like this. I’m not. My journalistic training and the books I’ve read and the friends I’ve made have allowed me to transcend Sunflower bashfulness. But it hasn’t absolved my guilt about being different.
There’s no guilt like Kansas guilt, and it lurks inside us like a vestigial organ from our founding. Although admitted as a free state on the eve of the Civil War 165 years ago, Kansas throbs with the political memory of the struggle that made us bleed. In our collective conscience there nags the worry we haven’t lived up to our promise, that even though we helped end the stain of slavery we still struggle with other deadly civic sins. From racism to hunger to inequality, the job remains unfinished. Nobody today remembers the state’s founding, but every living and reasoning Kansan takes their catechism from the pages of history.
We Kansans are not only a civil lot, as a whole, but a decent lot.

My definition of decency is behaving in a moral way, whether or not it conforms to accepted notions of respectability. You probably know a neighbor or a friend who has put their own self-interest aside to help you or someone else, and that’s the kind of approach Kelly specifically mentioned. Perhaps you donate food in a blessing box or give what you can to charity. But let me give you an historic example of Kansas decency in a time of trial.
During World War II, hundreds of thousands of captured German soldiers were sent to POW camps across America. Some of these camps were in Kansas, including one that held 100 or so prisoners at Peabody.
The POWs were billeted in town at a warehouse that had been turned into a prison. During the day the POWs were sent out to work, for meager pay, at surrounding farms, as long as the work was not dangerous and didn’t involve war production. POW labor helped alleviate a wartime manpower shortage at farms across Kansas.
“At first only the Mennonites invited the prisoners to work,” recalled Marian Franz, in the Mennonite Weekly Review in 1989. She had been an adolescent farm girl during the war. “Then others, observing the comfortable arrangement, employed them also.”
Franz wrote that she was more afraid of the armed U.S. guards than of the German prisoners. The Mennonites are historically known as pacifists and, during the war, many were conscientious objectors and given alternative service.
The German worked hard, were grateful for the quality of the food they were given, and even had a little time for hobbies such as sketching or whittling. The commander of the Peabody camp obtained soccer balls and boxing gloves for the prisoners. Even the guards who accompanied the prisoners to the field work developed a degree of trust.
“The original tension between the U.S. and German soldiers was relaxed by the hospitality that our Mennonite home and community extended equally to friend and foe,” Franz remembered. “As time went on fewer guards accompanied the prisoners. The guards no longer brought the guns into the house at mealtime. On occasion we sang together at the piano.”
Not everyone liked how well the German prisoners were being treated. Every time an American casualty list was printed in the papers, there were calls for some POWs to be executed. Once, when three farm women drove prisoners back their barracks in Peabody, they were unexpectedly met by a group of politicians, army officials and newspapermen who were conducting an official inspection. Wharton Hoch, a newspaper editor from nearby Marion, was particularly incensed. He condemned the practice of women transporting prisoners without guards, according to the Kansas City Times.
The commander of the four prison camps in central Kansas immediately put an end to the practice.
“When these prisoners first came to Kansas there was an urge on the part of the people to kill them,” the commander, Col. H.L. Shafer, told a town meeting, as reported by the Times. “Now there is a tendency to swing just as far the other way and fraternize with them. Treat them fairly but as prisoners.”
Franz became friends with one of the prisoners, Berthold Schwarz, who had been captured in North Africa after Erwin Rommel’s defeat. He returned to Germany at the end of the war. In 1988, Franz was reunited with Schwarz during a trip to Europe.
“It was evident the prisoner-of-war experience was emotional for Schwarz,” she wrote. “He pored over photos of how the Peabody prison looks today.”
I didn’t know of the German POW camp at Peabody until October, when I visited the historical society there and was surprised to see a wooden model of what appeared to be a twin-engine Heinkel bomber. It had been carved out of scrap wood by a German POW. There I also learned of “Spoils of Victory” by Daniel Markowitz, a 2025 novel about the German POW experience among Mennonite families in Kansas.
Franz, who for 24 years as director of the National Campaign for a Peace Tax Fund lobbied Congress unsuccessfully to establish the right of conscientious objectors not to fund wars, died in 2006. She was 76.
I’m not a pacifist. But I am worried about our current blundering into war, the increasing threat of nuclear annihilation, and the loss of the stabilizing influence of American power on the world stage.
I’m also not naive enough to think German prisoners during World War II were treated well in Kansas just because it was the right thing to do. Had they been Japanese prisoners, they likely would have been treated far worse, as were the Japanese Americans in the concentration camps at Manzanar and elsewhere. Also, there is the problem that the German POWs, decent people by appearances, were part of the Nazi regime. Hardcore Nazis, including SS officers, were barred from farm work, but even Rommel’s rank-and-file soldiers were fighting for fascism.
Which brings me back to Milgram and his famous experiment.
“Obedience, as a determinant of behavior, is of particular relevance to our time,” Milgram wrote in his 1974 book detailing his experiment. “It has been reliably established that from 1933 to 1945 millions of innocent people were systematically slaughtered on command. Gas chambers were built, death camps were guarded, daily quotas of corpses were produced with the same efficiency as the manufacture of appliances. These inhumane policies may have originated in the mind of a single person, but they could only have been carried out on a massive scale if a very large number of people obeyed orders.”
In 1960, Milgram devised the test, in which subjects were paid $4 an hour to administer the shocks, ostensibly to study the effect of pain on learning. The subjects were the ones with their fingers on the button. There was an “experimenter” who directed the shocks be increased while a “learner” supposedly tried to memorize word pairs, but the learners were actually actors who were in on the scheme.
Milgram found that two-thirds of subjects turned their machines up to the maximum of 450 volts when told to do so, despite the cries of pain from the learner. Perhaps more disturbing, every subject was willing to inflict some pain.
There has been ample criticism of Milgram’s work, particularly from psychologist Gina Perry, who in 2013 wrote “Behind the Shock Machine,” in which she interviews the original subjects and concludes Milgram may have overstated his percentages and erred in his broad generalizations. Yet, Milgram’s results have been replicated so many times that his conclusions remain substantially valid.
The real unease with Milgram’s experiments, I think, lies in the central question that drove him to experiment in the first place: Why are otherwise decent people disposed to obey orders that result in cruelty, suffering and death to their fellow human beings?
It is the essential question of civilization.
On presidential Election Day in 2024 I visited several polling places in my town and observed, from a safe and legal distance, as scores of my neighbors cast their votes. The polling places for some of the precincts, like mine, were churches. For others it was a public building, including the municipal auditorium. It all went smoothly enough, with voters behaving cordially and the volunteer poll workers doing their jobs with efficiency and dedication. As I watched, I recalled the Trolley Problem, a thought exercise in which you’re given the choice to kill one person in order to save five.
But I was wrong. What I was watching was akin to the Milgram experiment in real life.
No experimenter was giving orders to shock, but each person voting had the memory of authority figures — politicians, preachers, activists, family members and even journalists — crowding the booth with them. There were no fake electrical shocks or cries of pain, but there were real cultural and economic shocks and actual pain for unseen human beings radiating beyond the ballot.
We can think for ourselves, but often we do not. Every day is an actual Milgram experiment. The key to casting a moral vote is to seek reliable information, find the moral compass within yourself and act accordingly.
Failure leads to severe moral dissonance.
Just take Coldwater. This Kansas town overwhelmingly voted for Donald Trump and Kris Kobach. Yet, as Kansas Reflector Opinion Editor Clay Wirestone wisely points out, they also mourned the loss of their mayor, Joe Ceballos, who could face deportation after Attorney General Kobach filed fraud charges against him for voting without being a citizen.
Much of the rest of the country must be experiencing similar political vertigo. ICE is a murderous American masked police, the GOP-packed Supreme Court is poised to render yet more Dred Scott-like bad decisions, we’ve abducted the president of Venezuela and we’re risking the collapse of NATO by threatening to conquer Greenland.
Welcome to the new world disorder.
Most Kansans are civil and decent humans. But we need leaders, elected and otherwise, who will clearly denounce the moral collapse at the center of this political chaos, not call for more compromise or deference to authority. Now is the time not for civility, but for civil disobedience.

(Photo courtesy of ICE)The Louisiana Republican Party voted overwhelmingly Saturday to endorse President Donald Trump’s aggressive and controversial immigration enforcement efforts, even as Minnesota officials warn Minneapolis is descending into chaos as a result of a dramatic federal immigration crackdown. 
The Republican State Central Committee approved a resolution saying U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents are performing “vital work” that upholds “national sovereignty” and ensures public safety. The vote took place during the group’s quarterly meeting held this weekend in Baton Rouge. 
An initial draft of the resolution also rebuked Lt. Gov. Billy Nungesser, the second-highest ranking Republican in state government, for questioning Trump’s immigration strategy. Late last year, Nungesser told reporters he wondered whether the surge in federal border patrol agents who descended upon south Louisiana in December had hurt New Orleans’ tourism industry. 
But state Rep. Mike Bayham, R-Chalmette, convinced other members of the Republican committee to remove the comments about Nungesser from the resolution before the vote. Bayham said Nungesser is a popular elected official who regularly supports GOP causes by making donations to Republican women’s groups around the state. 

“This isn’t the time to pick a fight with the lieutenant governor,” Bayham said in an interview after the resolution passed. 

As lieutenant governor, Nungesser oversees the state’s tourism and marketing efforts. He said several business leaders in the hotel and restaurant industries had called him to say their employees had stopped showing up to their jobs during Louisiana’s immigration crackdown. Immigrants with legal work permits were scared they could get swept up in the federal raids if they went to work, he said.

Federal agents said they were targeting immigrants who weren’t in the country legally and who criminal backgrounds. But records show several people arrested during the Louisiana sweeps have no criminal history beyond traffic tickets, according to the Associated Press. 
Louisiana is also no longer a target from federal immigration enforcement. Border Patrol officers also abruptly pulled out of the state earlier this month so they could be redeployed to Minnesota, the Associated Press reported. 
For a few State Central Committee members Saturday, the frustration with Nungesser appeared to extend beyond his immigration comments. 

Charlie Buckels of Lafayette said he was upset with Nungesser because the lieutenant governor had “trashed” Gov. Jeff Landry and criticized the new closed party primary system Landry helped implement.

Nungesser has traveled the state campaigning against the new primary system, which he believes weakens moderate voters’ influence and empowers extremists in both political parties. 

Still, GOP activists at Saturday’s meeting said it would make the party leaders look foolish to criticize one of the state’s highest-profile Republicans. 

“What happens here is the media is going to talk about it, and that’s going to make us look like children,” committee member Heidi Parker Martin of New Iberia said, arguing against the formal criticism of Nungesser. “I would rather handle this in more of a private situation.” 

Reached by phone Saturday, Nungesser said state GOP leaders should have invited him to their meeting so he could defend himself against the criticism. Republicans should also be able to have a difference of opinion without facing a punishment for it, he added. 
“I speak out when something is wrong, and everybody should be able to do that,” Nungesser said.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/250317neworleans1-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-17 21:56:51.879213

TOPEKA — La actividad de agentes de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas de EE. UU. en Kansas City y en todos los Estados Unidos inspiró a una legisladora estatal demócrata a intentar apropiarse del proyecto de ley de un republicano que decía: “ICE no tendrá jurisdicción ni poder dentro del estado de Kansas ni de sus subdivisiones políticas.”
La representante Susan Ruiz, demócrata de Shawnee, propuso el miércoles en el pleno de la Cámara revisar el texto del proyecto de ley de la representante republicana Rebecca Schmoe, que establecía que organizaciones internacionales como las Naciones Unidas y la Organización Mundial de la Salud no tienen poder en Kansas.
En lugar de organizaciones internacionales, Ruiz insertó ICE.
“Tenemos que levantarnos”, dijo Ruiz. “Y al menos necesitamos decir — cada comunidad, cada ayuntamiento, cada comisionado de cada condado debe hacer una declaración para decir que ICE no es bienvenido en sus comunidades, y que, si están allí, deben ser sin máscara y bien identificados, y deberían llevar cámaras corporales.”
Ruiz basó la explicación de su enmienda en la reciente muerte de la exresidente de Kansas City Renee Good, a quien un agente de ICE disparó y mató a quemarropa a través del parabrisas de Good en Minneapolis.
“La tragedia siempre ocurre porque las personas que consiguen ese tipo de trabajos o se dedican a esos no tienen mucha formación. Y lo vimos”, dijo Ruiz. “Vimos todos los vídeos y puedes verlos tú mismo.”
Ruiz relacionó la actividad de ICE en todo el país con Kansas City, describiendo los efectos de una mayor presencia de agentes de inmigración. Menos gente va a trabajar, ir al supermercado y a las escuelas, dijo.
Mencionó informes de noticias sobre una redada de una horda de vehículos ICE en Kansas City, Missouri, dirigida por ICE en gasolineras y especulaciones sobre que ICE utilizara el área de Kansas City como base de concentración, lo cual no ha sido verificado.
Schmoe, un republicano de Ottawa, propuso el Proyecto de Ley 2204 de la Cámara en 2025. Fue la primera ley debatida en el pleno de la Cámara en la sesión legislativa de 2026, que comenzó el lunes.
Cuando los demócratas le presionaron para que explicara la motivación detrás del proyecto de ley, Schmoe dijo que su propósito era cerrar “una laguna que puede ser explotada”.
“Un grupo de mis electores acudió a mí y estaba muy preocupado porque entidades globales tomaran decisiones para Kansas, en lugar de para los habitantes de Kansas”, dijo.
Durante una audiencia en marzo de 2025 sobre el proyecto de ley, un alto miembro del personal legislativo lo calificó como “un proyecto de ley declarativo tal como es cualquier cosa” y puso en duda si las organizaciones internacionales objetivo tienen alguna autoridad existente en el estado.
Schmoe impugnó la enmienda de Ruiz, y un comité de normas decidió que no era pertinente, deteniendo el esfuerzo de Ruiz.
La Cámara votó el jueves para aprobar el proyecto de ley de Schmoe siguiendo las líneas partidistas, con 85 votos a favor y 35 en contra.

We must listen to people who are actually impacted.","Renee Good – shot three time and killed this month in Minneapolis by a masked Homeland Security agent, who then called her “a fucking bitch”.
George Retes, a US citizen and Army combat veteran, arrested by the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement in California and held for three days, allowed no communication with family or lawyers, and then released – without explanation, charges, or apology. 
Rümeysa Öztürk – a Tufts graduate student snatched off the street in Somerville by a team of government agents because she had the temerity to write an op-ed in the university newspaper criticizing the school’s response to the Israel-Hamas war. 
Incidents like these that are the result of the Trump administration’s efforts to rid the country of people it deems unworthy are profoundly alarming – but often distant – to many us who are comfortable in our status.  
But every citizen of the Commonwealth is indirectly supporting and benefitting from this effort. The 2026 Massachusetts budget anticipates collecting more than $25 million from the federal government for housing ICE prisoners at the Plymouth County Correctional Facility — the only facility in the state currently contracted with ICE to detain people.  
We need to own the consequences of this budgetary — and moral – decision. The intuitive reaction is that this is blood money. We must refuse to lease beds in our correctional facilities to ICE.  
Despite the visceral appeal of such a stance, we need to take a more nuanced view. Prohibiting ICE from holding prisoners in Plymouth County might actually harm the very people we are trying to protect. That said, if we are going to let ICE detain people here and take their money, at the least, we must not treat the funds like they are just another neutral source of revenue. 
There’s a compelling argument that no part of the state government should make ICE’s job easier: Collaborating with immoral action is never justified. We should, under this thinking, immediately cancel the contract with ICE.  
How the country addresses immigration is, admittedly, not an easy issue. We need immigrants – and have long been a place where those from other countries sought to a build a new, better life — and we also need secure borders. I know how hard striking this balance can be.  
When I served under Gov. Patrick as an undersecretary of public safety and security, I was tasked with defending why the Commonwealth was participating in the Obama administration’s Secure Communities program – an effort to identify when local and state police had arrested someone without immigration documentation.   
This is not an argument about the substance of who should be able to enter the country and under what circumstances. Whatever the validity of the underlying policy goals, ICE is engaged in activities that we cannot tolerate. As a prosecutor and public safety official, I have learned that process matters: How you go about enforcing the law is at least as important as the objective. Good policing is deeply mindful of that.   
It is not acceptable for government agents to act like the secret police in a totalitarian state, detaining people without identifying themselves by name or agency. It is neither necessary nor productive to go into the streets in full military kit carrying rifles designed for combat. These actions are designed to bully and intimidate, not preserve community safety. And – notwithstanding the recent opinion of the Supreme Court – it should be plainly unconstitutional for the government to stop and question people because of their race or ethnicity.   
Cancelling the Commonwealth’s contract with ICE would make every detention more costly and logistically complicated, as the federal government would have to spend more time and money on transportation. We should consider anything that throws sand in the gears of the deportation machine. There is even some evidence that jurisdictions with fewer detention beds see less ICE activity. 
I had concluded, therefore, with great rectitude, that there is no reason that we should allow ICE to hold people in Plymouth County – and that we should end our cooperation. Then I shared my opinion with a colleague who was personally affected. 
She is the close friend of someone who had just been arrested. She argued that banning ICE from holding people here would be a mistake. She couldn’t visit her friend if he was brought to a detention facility in Louisiana or Florida.  
As with all policies, it is important not to make decisions from afar. We must listen to people who are actually impacted. My friend prompted me to consider whether, as long as ICE is going to snatch people off our streets, we might decide that we want our immigrant neighbors held as close to home as possible, for as long as possible.  
Ending the ICE contract with the state might not mean fewer arrests in the Commonwealth. It might just mean ICE bundles even more detainees off to faraway for-profit prisons in jurisdictions with less sympathetic courts, further from counsel and family, and beyond the reach of inspection by state officials and state law. 
There is no easy answer. But this much, it seems to me, is clear: If we continue contracting with ICE, we must stop quietly collecting money from this arrangement and pretending that it does not facilitate ICE’s cruelty. Instead, the Commonwealth must match its rhetoric about supporting immigrants with its budget: Every dollar ICE pays us should be dedicated to programs that counter that agency’s inhumanity.  
The $25 million we expect from ICE this year could increase the state’s allocation to immigrant legal defense by 500 percent. Or it could more than double the Refugee Social Services Program. If we redirect ICE payments in this way, the Commonwealth would need to absorb the cost of housing the ICE detainees in Plymouth. But this is the only way we can allow ICE to use our facilities and still align our actions with our values.  
Gov. Healey and the Legislature must take this opportunity to be a national model for how to use ICE’s own resources to mitigate the horror of its policies.

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)Democrat Abigail Spanberger was sworn in Saturday as Virginia’s 75th governor, making history as the first woman to hold the commonwealth’s highest office and pledging to lead with unity, affordability and pragmatic action amid deep national divisions and growing uncertainty coming out of Washington.
Within hours of taking the oath, Spanberger, 46, moved swiftly to define the priorities of her administration, signing a package of executive orders aimed at lowering costs for families, strengthening public education, responding to federal disruptions and reshaping the internal operations of state government — an early signal that her tenure will be focused on affordability and what she described as “delivering results.
Standing on the steps of the Virginia state Capitol in Richmond, Spanberger framed the moment as both historic and forward-looking, calling the peaceful transfer of power “a cornerstone of our American democratic experiment” and a defining feature of American democracy.
“It is the honor of my life to stand before you and take the oath today,” Spanberger said, underscoring the gravity of the moment and her responsibility to all Virginians. 
She reflected on the generations who expanded democracy in Virginia — particularly women who fought for the right to vote and hold office — saying she stood before those “who could only dream of a day like today.”
Spanberger was sworn in alongside fellow Democrats Ghazala Hashmi, who took the oath as lieutenant governor, becoming the first Muslim to win statewide office anywhere in the United States, and Jay Jones, who was sworn in as Virginia’s attorney general, making history as the commonwealth’s first Black attorney general.
The ceremony drew a cross-section of Virginia’s political leadership, including all living former governors, from outgoing Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin to L. Douglas Wilder, the nation’s first elected Black governor, who celebrated his 95th birthday Saturday and whom Spanberger recognized during the event.

Gov. Wes Moore of Maryland and U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-CA, were also in attendance. 
Spanberger thanked Youngkin and former first lady Suzanne Youngkin for their cooperation during the transition, as well as former Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, former Attorney General Jason Miyares and members of the outgoing administration for their service. The latter two did not attend the ceremony.
 A historic oath, a forward-looking message

Much of Spanberger’s inaugural address traced Virginia’s long democratic arc — from native sons George Washington and Patrick Henry to the suffrage movement and the Civil Rights era — but she repeatedly emphasized that the day was ultimately about the future Virginians will shape together.
Citing Patrick Henry’s warning that “United we stand, divided we fall,” Spanberger urged Virginians not to fracture into factions that threaten democratic institutions. 
She said the work of perfecting democracy has never been finished, but argued that Virginia’s history shows progress is possible when leaders and citizens confront challenges directly.
“This square has been the scene of remarkable dramas of equality and justice,” she said, referencing suffragists who pressed their cause at the Capitol, the delayed ratification of the 19th Amendment, and the 1957 Pilgrimage of Prayer led by the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.
She also invoked moments when Virginia leaders confronted division head-on, quoting former Gov. Linwood Holton’s call to move beyond partisan camps and to “act together,” and highlighting Wilder’s 1990 inauguration as another milestone that reshaped expectations of who could lead.
Throughout the address, Spanberger emphasized the meaning of Virginia as a commonwealth — a government designed to serve the common good — and framed unity as both a moral obligation and a practical necessity.
 Executive actions underscore affordability focus

The urgency of that message was reflected in Spanberger’s first official acts as governor.
The series of executive orders she signed after the swearing in were designed to confront rising costs, reinforce public education and prepare the state for potential disruptions tied to federal policy changes.
“Today, we are responding to the moment,” Spanberger said. “We are setting the tone for what Virginians can expect over the next four years: pragmatic leadership focused on lowering costs and delivering results.”
The first three executive orders focus squarely on affordability — an issue that she declared a centerpiece of her 2026 agenda during a news conference in December.
One requires the governor’s secretaries and all executive branch agencies to submit reports within 90 days identifying immediate, actionable steps to reduce living expenses for Virginians, including housing, health care, energy, education, child care and grocery costs.
A second establishes an Interagency Health Financing Task Force within the Office of the Secretary of Health and Human Resources, charged with developing a unified financing strategy to reduce duplicative spending, maximize federal funding and strengthen Virginia’s long-term health care infrastructure. 
The task force is directed to assess programs most vulnerable to federal policy changes, review oversight of managed care organizations and evaluate shared technology, licensing and procurement systems.
A third directive launches a comprehensive review of housing development regulations and permitting practices, with the goal of eliminating unnecessary requirements and reducing barriers to housing production. It also creates a Commission on Unlocking Housing Production to recommend legislative, regulatory and administrative changes to increase housing supply statewide.
Academic progress is the focus of a fourth executive order directing the Department of Education to strengthen literacy and math instruction, review accountability measures and expand access to advanced math coursework. 
The directive calls for implementing recommendations from a 2025 JLARC report, advancing a next-generation assessment system and launching a statewide listening tour of educators, parents and students.
Other executive actions respond to external pressures, including federal workforce reductions, funding cuts, tariff impacts and immigration-related effects. 
One order establishes an Economic Resiliency Task Force to coordinate the state’s response, including managing potential disruptions to Medicaid and SNAP, supporting displaced federal workers and expanding agricultural and forestry exports amid tariff uncertainty.
Additional orders initiate a review of the Board of Visitors appointment process for public colleges and universities; establish narrowly defined standby emergency authority for senior officials if the governor is unreachable; formally delegate operational authority to the governor’s chief of staff; and create a comprehensive equal opportunity and non-discrimination policy across state government.
A tenth executive order rescinds Youngkin’s Executive Order 47, which required and encouraged state and local law enforcement agencies to divert resources toward enforcing federal civil immigration laws. 
The directive redirects law enforcement to focus on core public safety responsibilities, including investigating crime, staffing local jails and engaging with communities.
The move aligns with a position Spanberger outlined during an interview with The Mercury in August, when she said she would move quickly as governor to end policies she argued pulled Virginia law enforcement away from their primary mission and strained already limited resources.
 A personal case for pragmatic governance

In her inaugural address, Spanberger did not name President Donald Trump, but repeatedly referenced federal actions and rhetoric she said were unsettling Virginians.
“I know many of you are worried about the recklessness coming out of Washington,” she said, citing concerns over health care access, rising costs, attacks on public servants and policies she said betray American values.
She rooted her priorities in personal experience, describing her middle-class upbringing, her work as a federal law enforcement officer and her service as a CIA case officer focused on counterterrorism and nuclear proliferation.
Those roles, she said, reinforced the importance of accountability and service — lessons she now brings to the governor’s office. She also spoke as a mother of three daughters, emphasizing the strain rising costs place on families and the difficulty of planning for the future amid uncertainty.
Her policy agenda centers on affordability, education, economic growth and public safety. She pledged to tackle housing costs by cutting red tape and increasing supply, lower energy costs by ensuring high-volume users pay their fair share, and protect health care access while addressing prescription drug pricing practices.
As she closed her address, Spanberger urged Virginians to consider how future generations will judge this moment.
“Choose to stand united. Choose to serve one another. Choose to act together,” she said. “As we continue forward, let us be united for Virginia’s future.”

From Wichita’s world-class aviation industry to Olathe-based Garmin, Kansas knows how to build, create, and lead. However, one of the biggest threats to our state’s innovation is the challenge  imposed by a federal agency that was never meant to serve against the interests of American businesses: the U.S. International Trade Commission, or ITC.
Patent trolls, which are shell companies that buy up old patents solely to sue productive businesses, use the ITC as leverage to force costly settlements. The agency’s Section 337 statute, meant to protect U.S. industries from unfair foreign trade, has been twisted by patent trolls into a tool for private profit. Patent trolls file cases with the ITC because the agency has an extraordinary power called an exclusion order to ban certain products from entering the United States. Given the devastating consequences an exclusion order can have for a business, the possibility of losing a case and receiving one is enough to lead patent trolls’ targets to settle.
It’s complete extortion, and it drains time, money and resources that could otherwise go toward research, hiring, and growth.
Garmin, a proud Kansas company employing thousands across the state and one of America’s top technology and navigation companies, has spent years fending off patent troll infringement cases before the ITC. The problem isn’t that Garmin has done anything wrong, as courts have repeatedly ruled in its favor, tossing out weak and baseless patent claims. The problem is that the ITC’s process itself gives patent trolls an opening to exploit.
Garmin is often forced to defend itself from patent trolls at the ITC. Despite multiple victories in court, the company has still had to use up resources and valuable time. Instead of shielding American innovation, the ITC is giving foreign patent trolls a platform to drain American companies like Garmin.
Kansas isn’t alone. Across the country, the ITC’s outdated process has allowed patent trolls to file cases that threaten the supply chain and increase costs for businesses and consumers alike. Legal experts have long warned that the ITC’s broad interpretation of “domestic industry” invites abuse. A Hastings Science & Technology Law Journal study found that patent trolls routinely exploit this loophole to extract settlements rather than protect real innovation. In an economy where every dollar counts, these unnecessary battles hurt competitiveness and jeopardize American jobs.
In Kansas, the effect is especially clear. Garmin employs nearly 5,000 Kansans at its U.S. operational headquarters in Olathe and ranks among America’s best large employers. Its success supports families, local suppliers, and the broader regional economy. Every dollar spent fighting useless patent claims is a dollar not spent on innovation, hiring or investment in Kansas communities.
That’s why members of Congress have introduced the Advancing America’s Interests Act. This bipartisan legislation would reform the ITC to ensure it only intervenes when those who make claims have a legitimate U.S. industry at stake. In other words, if you don’t make anything or employ anyone in the United States, you can’t weaponize the process.
The AAIA restores the ITC’s original intent, protecting genuine American innovation, not rewarding litigation abuse. For Kansas, that means companies like Garmin can focus on doing what they do best: designing cutting-edge products, supporting local jobs, and fueling our state’s economic growth.
Leaders like Rep. Ron Estes, R-Kansas, understand what’s at stake. He’s been a strong voice for protecting Kansas workers, innovators, and manufacturers. He understands that standing up to patent abuse isn’t just about fixing a federal agency, it’s about defending the jobs, technologies and communities that make Kansas – and the United States – strong.
While patent trolls may game the system, Kansas thrives on hard work and innovation. It’s time for real accountability to the ITC.

In a letter rejecting the complaint, Gallus said the mailing could be viewed as partisan but that doesn’t mean it creates a violation under his jurisdiction.
Last week, a Harlowton voter filed a complaint alleging the Secretary of State’s Office should not have used taxpayer dollars to pay for the postcard, which said “only citizens should be allowed to vote.”
The Secretary of State’s Office has not responded to a question about the cost of the postcard or how many Montanans received it. Montana has nearly 785,000 registered voters.
The postcard announced a partnership with the federal government to “strengthen election security” and featured a picture of Secretary Christi Jacobsen and President Donald Trump.
The complaint said the postcard pushed a false narrative that “elections are rigged” and “someone other than citizens” are voting.
However, Gallus said the complaint does not clearly allege any violation of statute over which he has jurisdiction. He also said elected officials have a responsibility to communicate with citizens, and voters elected the Secretary of State based in part on her political leanings.
“Expecting that all communication following an election would be devoid of a political bent so as to avoid any criticism or open debate is unreasonable and impracticable,” Gallus wrote in the letter.
Gallus said he wanted to address the complaint in detail because his office has received numerous inquiries about the postcard in relation to “the use of government funds or resources.”
“Montana’s elected officials routinely provide communications to Montana citizens which under a certain lens may appear to be political,” Gallus wrote. “Montana laws do prohibit the use of public resources for political purposes.”
But he said he and staff in his office reviewed the mailer, and it does not appear to violate any provision of the Montana Code of Ethics or any campaign regulation because it “does not have a political purpose” as defined by law.
In making that determination, he said, he looks for words that solicit support or opposition to any political committee; nomination or election of a person to public office; or passage of a ballot issue. That means language such as “vote,” “oppose,” “support,” “elect,” “defeat,” or “reject.”
Gallus said his office also looks at whether material depicts a clearly identified candidate, party or ballot issue “in a manner that is susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as a call for the nomination, election or defeat” of the candidate or issue.
Gallus said it is a high bar, and the postcard doesn’t meet the threshold. He said neither Jacobsen or Trump are currently running for office, and the mailing doesn’t include any express words of support.
“Public officials have associated duties, which include communicating with constituents,” Gallus wrote. “For Montana’s Secretary of State, this means communicating with all voters regarding elections, voting and the SOS positions on citizen only voting, which she appears to be doing here.”
In a subsequent news release, the Secretary of State’s Office said it had identified 23 potential non-citizens who had voted. A spokesperson did not answer questions about when they most recently voted, what counties they had voted in, or what the next steps would be.
Missoula County Elections Administrator Bradley Seaman said earlier the 23 potential non-citizens indicated the current system is working well; it represented 29-one-thousandths of 1 percent of voters.
Seaman also said it is important to address those findings as soon as possible. He pointed to a recent tied vote in Missoula County where one vote would have made a difference. (In that case, a council race, the Missoula City Council made the appointment.)
To vote in Montana, people need to be a U.S. citizen, at least 18 years old before the election, and a Montana resident for at least 30 days before the next election.

Jan. 16, 2026 | Photo by Ben Solis/Michigan AdvanceDETROIT – U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens said Friday that a key portion of her time in the U.S. Senate, if she becomes the Democratic nominee in August and is elected in November, would focus on helping Black, brown and other minority communities thrive across Michigan.
Stevens visited Detroit this week to roll out what those plans might look like, calling it her “Michigan Hope Agenda.” The congresswoman unveiled the policy proposals during a “fireside chat” Friday moderated by state Rep. Joe Tate (D-Detroit) at the Durfee Innovation Society.
Stevens said she would focus on equitable federal investments back into communities, economic empowerment and access to capital, safer communities so families and businesses can flourish, and health and stability for those same families. The congresswoman further extolled the need for education innovation and workforce assurances, well-managed water and infrastructure, and lowering the overall costs of housing.
Stevens said that for her to succeed in the U.S. Senate, she needs to make sure that residents back home can connect the dots to quality economic development that doesn’t leave minority communities behind.

“We know that there, for too long, have been communities that get overlooked. We know that there has been a lack of investment in communities of Black and brown communities,” Stevens said. “That hope for equal really deeply matters.”
That’s why things like housing and investments and public health will take center stage in a would-be Senate tenure for Stevens.
“It’s a path for all of us to succeed,” she said. “And to do this in the Motor City, the heart of Detroit, we’re going to put our stake into what Michigan needs at the lawmaking table, in that chief lawmaking role for our state, in the U.S. Senate.”
Stevens previously worked as an organizer and later in the administration of former President Barack Obama as the chief of staff to his auto rescue efforts. The congresswoman said that people had written Detroit off the map, but now, the lights continue to be on in the city and it has become a beacon of urban renewal since those Obama years and onward.
She hopes to continue that work serving in the Senate as she ramps up her bid to win the Democratic nomination in the August primary. She would have big shoes to fill after U.S. Sen. Gary Peters announced that he would not seek reelection this year, although both he and Stevens have been routinely hailed as two of Michigan’s most effective federal lawmakers.
Stevens, Peters rated most effective Democrats in technology, other key policy areas

Making a policy pronouncement on how she would assist minority communities, at the top of the year, follows Stevens’ aim to make a splash as primary season gets into full swing — she currently faces a three-way race with state Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak) and former Detroit health official Abdul El-Sayed.
On federal investments, Stevens said she would work to ensure federal resources and infrastructure dollars are delivered equitably to underserved Michigan communities to strengthen public services, transit, and economic opportunity where it is needed most.
Stevens would expand access to capital and training for underserved communities and advance an industrial policy that creates jobs, lowers costs, and strengthens Michigan’s economic future.
Safer communities would take precedence in her policy agenda, and Stevens said she would advance fair and accountable policing, invest in community-based violence prevention, and strengthen common sense gun safety laws to protect families and rebuild trust.
A common theme for the Democrats in the race, Stevens said her tenure would also focus on health care issues, particularly lowering the costs of care, advancing health equity, protecting science-based care, and defending Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid so Michigan families can live with dignity, health, and security.
A 21st Century manufacturing model would guide her policy focus with an emphasis on investments in STEM and job-training pipelines, and other policies that strengthen the supply chain and prepare workers for the industries of the future.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Clean and safe drinking water is also top of mind for Stevens. She said she would champion funding for lead pipe replacement and ending PFAS contamination, all with a focus on environmental justice.
Housing is also a big component of the plan. Following the chat with Tate, Stevens told reporters that her plan would also focus on Generation Z homebuyers who may feel like they are left out of attaining home ownership due to financial strains and lack of access to the very capital she wants to make available.
She said that was something that she and Tate, the former Michigan House Speaker, often talk about at the local level in Detroit.
“Under his leadership, there were some remarkable improvements to our housing development here in the state. There is a lot more to do, though,” Stevens said. “It’s not just about starting the conversation and recognizing that home ownership now begins at a much later age. For this next generation, we need to put more money in people’s pocketbooks.”
Stevens said one of the federal solutions she’s working on legislatively is for a pre-tax savings program so people can buy homes earlier.
“That way, we can increase the affordable home stock here in Michigan and support our building trades as we move forward,” Stevens said. “But this has to do with an economic agenda that is clearly not serving us well under this current administration. Erratic tariffs have been a tax on people. Their pocketbooks are being stretched, and that’s taking away from the investments that people could be making in that first home.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/P1166504-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-17 10:57:47.009294

For Detroit homeowners over 65 who overwhelmingly live on fixed incomes, unexpected costs – increases in grocery prices, rising health care premiums or an emergency repair – heighten their risk of financial instability and can even lead to them falling into poverty.
I am a policy researcher at Poverty Solutions at the University of Michigan. Our initiative uses action-based research, an approach that seeks to understand real-world problems and inform policy changes that could make life work better for people with low incomes. The center recently examined data from the 2023 American Community Survey to explore how low-income seniors in Detroit are affected by declining housing values and high housing costs compared to seniors across Michigan.
Federal, state and local programs to help seniors with these costs are already strained. As the population of older adults in metro Detroit continues to grow, demand for support services, such as caregiving and healthy meal programs, will likely increase.
 Housing cost burdens are more acute for Detroit seniors

The poverty rate of senior-headed households in Detroit is nearly twice as high as the rate statewide.
Detroit seniors, both owners and renters, are more likely to be housing cost-burdened than Michigan seniors overall, with 45% paying more than 30% of their income on housing costs compared to 31% of seniors statewide. This is partially driven by lower median incomes in the city compared to the state.
Even when we focus on the seniors who would be considered the most financially stable, those who own their homes free and clear, the proportion burdened by housing costs is twice as high as the state: 32% versus 16%.

 Detroit seniors pay more for property taxes and utilities

Lower incomes aren’t the only thing driving the higher housing cost burden. Detroit seniors pay more for all homeownership costs, including utilities – not only as a proportion of home values and income, but also in terms of real costs.
Detroiters face higher rates for auto insurance, and they pay more for utilities, compared to others in the state, adding to a situation where many residents, especially seniors on fixed incomes, struggle to make ends meet.
While the cost of living in urban areas is often higher compared to suburban and rural places, my analysis found that comparative costs for insurance, water, electricity and gas are lower in cities such as Milwaukee and Pittsburgh, which points to systemic issues that might be unique to Detroit.

Insurance and property taxes are also higher for seniors in Detroit compared to seniors across the state, especially relative to median home values. Detroit seniors pay the same or slightly more for these essentials despite living in homes that are worth less, based on the analysis.
The median house value for senior property owners in Detroit is $65,000, compared to $170,000 for seniors in Michigan.
 High property taxes and insurance rates drive costs

Detroit lost over half a million residents between 1980 and 2020, causing an oversupply of single-family housing stock and a steady drop in home prices.
As residents left and businesses followed, the property tax base eroded. To generate the same revenue as cities with a richer tax base, Detroit levies property taxes at relatively high rates. Detroiters face a property tax rate close to 3%, significantly higher than the national average of 1.38%.
The housing market in Detroit has seen such large declines in property values that a disconnect has emerged. The replacement cost of a home, which is the actual expense required to reconstruct the dwelling, is often substantially higher than its current market value. This makes the cost of homeowner’s insurance disproportionately expensive relative to the market value of a home in Detroit.
A property’s condition and the condition of neighboring properties also raises the cost of homeowner’s insurance because insurance premiums are primarily influenced by the risk associated with insuring a property. Poor property and neighborhood conditions limit the availability of homeowner’s insurance, driving those who want homeowner’s insurance to purchase costly policies from insurers of last resort, or companies that provide coverage to people who cannot obtain it through other means due to high insurance risks.
The high cost drives many Detroit residents to forgo homeowner’s insurance. According to my analysis, almost 35% of Detroit seniors do not insure their homes, putting their main financial asset at risk.
 Big utility bills

Utility bills in Detroit are higher compared to those statewide for two reasons: higher use and higher rates. The housing stock in Detroit is significantly older, with 88% of Detroit seniors living in houses built before 1960, compared to 34% of seniors in the rest of the state. These older homes use more energy because they often lack modern insulation and have single-paned windows, outdated appliances, older plumbing fixtures and poor seals around windows and doors.
Detroiters and others in Michigan served by DTE Energy, a utility provider, pay gas and electricity rates that are higher than others in the state. Detroiters also pay more for utilities due to a 5% “utility users tax” added to their gas and electricity bills. This surcharge isn’t new. It stems from legislation originally passed in the 1970s, and the funds collected flow to the Public Lighting Authority, which is responsible for improving and maintaining street lights in the city, and to the Detroit Police Department.
In the wake of Detroit’s bankruptcy filing in 2013, the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department carried out widespread shut-offs. From 2014 to 2020, the shut-offs affected as many as 141,000 Detroit residents, mostly those with low incomes. The crisis garnered national and international attention.
The initial crisis has passed, yet the cost of water continues to increase across the entire state, with those in the metro Detroit area served by the Great Lakes Water Authority seeing substantially higher rate increases than the state overall to cover deferred maintenance and infrastructure costs.
 Costs are compounded by social isolation

Costs stemming from isolation and disability exacerbate the financial strain Detroit seniors already face.
Several factors contribute to older adults living alone, including increased life expectancy for women as well as children and family members moving farther away from each other. Older adults living alone are also more likely to be poorer than older adults who are a part of a larger household.
This issue is more pronounced in Detroit, where 54.7% of seniors live alone compared to the 43.2% statewide average. Living alone increases the risk of social isolation, which is linked to poorer health outcomes. Detroit seniors also have higher rates of disability than other seniors in the state of Michigan, which can lead to higher health care costs, decreased mobility and increased social isolation.
 Less funding could create more hardship

Historically the demand for support outstrips the available resources, with only a small proportion of eligible households receiving energy assistance. And now, programs that help vulnerable seniors with the costs of utilities are at risk of funding cuts.
Detroit Water and Sewerage Department’s Lifeline Plan, launched in 2022, ran out of state and federal money in October 2025.
Meanwhile, the entire staff that administers the federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, known as LIHEAP, was cut in April 2025. While the program is funded in the continuing resolution passed on Nov. 12, 2025, it is zeroed out in the president’s fiscal year 2026 proposed budget.
Even before funding uncertainties emerged, Detroit seniors who own their homes faced institutional barriers accessing property tax relief, putting many at risk of tax foreclosure. Additionally, Detroiters struggle to keep up with home repair costs, heightened by the needs of older homes and because the home repair assistance system is fragmented and difficult to access.
Without these programs, Detroit seniors will be left without an essential lifeline.

Unions and advocates want a wealth tax targeting billionaires to make up the loss.,"Guest Commentary written by

Josephine Rios
Josephine Rios is a nursing assistant at Kaiser Permanente.


Doctors told us my grandson wouldn’t live past three months, but they didn’t know Elijah was capable of. Today he’s 7 years old, stubborn as ever and fighting every day to prove them wrong.
Elijah was born with cerebral palsy. Caring for him is a full-time, all-hands-on-deck operation that includes in-home nurses, physical and occupational therapy, school support and a small pharmacy’s worth of medications. 
None of that care is optional. It’s what keeps him alive, learning, laughing and giving me attitude. 
It’s only possible because of Medi-Cal. Now California’s health care system — the system that keeps Elijah alive — is being pushed to the brink. With $100 billion a year in federal health care cuts barreling toward Americans, California is expected to lose about $30 billion a year in Medi-Cal funding. 
Families like mine are living in a state of panic. Elijah’s medications alone would run over $5,000 a month. That’s not a “tough choice” for a working family — that’s impossible. 
And the emergency rooms we rely on when his seizures hit? They may not even be open.
This isn’t a hypothetical threat. This is my reality. It’s the reality of millions of Californians who depend on the care we’ve been promised.
This disaster is preventable. There’s a simple, fair, no-nonsense solution on the table, the 2026 Billionaire Tax Act. I’m one of thousands of Californians fighting for it, as the campaign collects signatures to place the proposal on the ballot this year.

As a nursing assistant, union member and grandmother battling to keep a special needs child healthy, I don’t have time for political games. I’m interested in what works, and this would work.
The measure would create a one-time, 5% emergency tax on Californians worth more than $1 billion. That’s roughly 200 people, who together hold more than $2 trillion in wealth. The tax would be spread out over a five-year span.
And because of loopholes in tax law, most of that money may never be taxed at all.
This proposal would raise $100 billion for California. It would keep hospitals open, protect Medi-Cal, prevent layoffs of health care workers and keep 3.4 million Californians who are at risk insured. 
In other words, it would keep my grandson and many others alive.
As for the billionaires, they honestly wouldn’t even feel it.
I’ve heard some people say this tax is “punishing success.” Give me a break. Working families already pay our share. We pay it every time we choose which bills to pay. Every time we work a double shift. Every time we sit in an ER praying that the lights stay on long enough to keep our kids breathing.
All we’re asking is for the tiny group who benefit the most from California’s economy, to pitch in one time to prevent a total health care collapse. That’s not punishment. That’s responsibility.
Voters from across the political spectrum support this. When your child or parent is sick, politics matter a whole lot less than their survival.
The ultra-wealthy and their lobbyists are already gearing up to fight this effort. They always do. They’re loud, they’re powerful and they’re used to getting their way.
But I’ve got news for them: so am I. I’ve had to fight for Elijah since the day he was born. I’ve fought for my patients, my coworkers and my community for decades. I know how to stand my ground, and I know I’m not standing alone.
California is at the cliff’s edge. We can either let the healthcare system fall, or we can pull together and pull it back.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/031125-Medicaid-Bakersfield-LV_CM_10.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-17 08:57:26.587593

First State Ballet Comes to The Baby Grand
Presented by Delaware’s only professional ballet company, “Dreams In Motion” features two works by choreographer Viktor Plotnikov that highlight both technical precision and expressive storytelling. The program includes Fantasy to Dvořák and Nonsense (In the Sense of Innocence), offering contrasting yet complementary interpretations of the dream world.
Saturday, February 21, 2026 at 7:00 p.m. and Sunday, February 22, 2026 at 2:00 p.m. at the Baby Grand Theater inside The Grand Opera House, First State Ballet Theatre invites audiences to experience “Dreams In Motion”, a contemporary ballet program that explores imagination, emotion, and the fluid nature of dreams through movement.
In Fantasy to Dvořák, dancers respond to the rich musical compositions of Antonín Dvořák with lyrical movement that emphasizes musicality and emotional depth. The choreography allows the dancers to move seamlessly between strength and softness, creating a visually compelling piece that feels both grounded and ethereal. The ballet showcases the company’s classical foundation while embracing contemporary phrasing and flow.
Nonsense (In the Sense of Innocence) shifts the tone to something more playful and whimsical. This work leans into the unpredictable nature of dreams, using inventive movement and lighthearted interactions to spark curiosity and delight. The choreography invites audiences to interpret the performance through their own lens, reflecting how dreams often feel familiar yet open to endless meaning.
The Baby Grand Theater provides an intimate setting for this program, allowing audiences to experience the nuances of the choreography up close. Located within The Grand Opera House in downtown Wilmington, the venue enhances the connection between dancers and viewers, making each performance feel personal and immersive.
Tickets for “Dreams In Motion” range from $42 to $62, offering an accessible opportunity to experience professional ballet in a contemporary format. Whether you are a longtime dance enthusiast or attending ballet for the first time, this program offers a fresh perspective on movement, music, and storytelling.

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)There are a few different tactics for passing legislation. One is to pick a change in the law that’s not likely to draw too many detractors. Another is to take a big swing at a change in the law that’s certain to be opposed and will likely need to be offered to legislators during a few sessions so they can learn more about the issue.
With open meetings laws, South Dakota Attorney General Marty Jackley has chosen the first course of action. He has offered three bills that will make slight, but needed, changes.
Those bills include a clarification that an agenda must include items to be considered during an official meeting; a revision for the requirements for executive session; and a requirement that a state open meeting agenda must be posted on the state website 72 hours before the meeting is scheduled to start.

Those bills aren’t likely to elicit too much of a howl from lawmakers. No one can blame Jackley for reaching for some low-hanging fruit. However, while the attorney general is noted for being tough on crime, he has yet to try to put any teeth in the laws governing the punishment of open meetings violators. The problem is that as well-intentioned as Jackley’s bills are, they don’t approach what South Dakota really needs to fix its open meetings problems.
On one end, there will be an effort this year to bring light to the public, letting them know when meetings will be held and what will be on the agenda. Still dwelling in the dark is the fact that there is a lack of accountability whenever the boards of local governments — city council, school board, county commission — go into a closed or executive session. By law they are allowed to meet behind closed doors to discuss personnel matters or student expulsion, consult with an attorney or negotiate contracts.
The problem is that once the public has been sent away, there’s no way to know if the local board is following the rules. There have been cases of elected officials using that time away from the public to discuss locally controversial issues that don’t fit within the limits allowed by law. Some boards use the fact that their lawyer is in the room to claim that they are “consulting” on legal matters while they discuss how to handle volatile issues.
Other states have recognized this loophole and adopted specific rules for when the local commission can shut the door and consult with its attorney. The law in Arizona says such a consultation in a closed meeting is allowed for the “discussion or consultation with the attorneys of the public body in order to consider its position and instruct its attorneys regarding the public body’s position regarding contracts that are the subject of negotiations, in pending or contemplated litigation or in settlement discussions conducted in order to avoid or resolve litigation.”
Unless an elected official comes forward to say that she believes the executive session she just sat through broke the law, there’s no way of knowing what goes on behind closed doors. One idea that’s been floating around South Dakota open government circles is having each executive session recorded. When a question arises about whether or not the board followed the law, the recording would be reviewed privately by a judge to determine if there were any violations.










The problem is that once the public has been sent away, there’s no way to know if the local board is following the rules.


So far, no one in the Legislature or state government wants to take on those fights. Many see the Legislature, top-heavy with Republicans, as a roadblock to significant change. That’s odd, because Republicans should be the first ones calling for greater transparency in government.
These are the same lawmakers clamoring for more transparency in state credit card use after discovering the spendthrift ways of former Gov. Kristi Noem. It stands to reason that greater transparency in the workings of local governments would also be good for taxpayers.
Some lawmakers have said that cutting the budgets of counties and school districts would ease some of the complaints they’re hearing about high property taxes. They should welcome a means for keeping an eye on those tax dollars by ensuring that there’s a way to figure out what local officials are up to in executive session.
The state’s open meetings law has its share of violations. To his credit, Jackley resurrected the Open Meetings Commission that had gone dormant for four years. Last November, that commission found local boards had violated the open meetings law in 10 of 12 cases.
Some violations are just a misinterpretation of the law. Others are blatant attempts to keep public business out of public view. To strengthen that law, the state needs leaders who aren’t content to just reach for low-hanging fruit.

I’m sure Cosell would have some strong words about the financial factors and threats that have left Missouri without an NFL football team for the first time since 1960 despite the significant taxpayer funds spent to develop both Kansas City’s Arrowhead Stadium and the domed stadium once used by St. Louis Rams.
Cosell regularly attacked the NFL franchises and local governments for using threats to depart a city without higher local tax funds to improve their stadiums.
News stories about Cosell’s 1970s testimony to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, quoted him saying those efforts were “blackmail” and “extortion.”
“Let them run their business like any other without protection granted by Congress. Lord knows they’re big business” Cosell was quoted by UPI as testifying before the committee.
There is a direct Missouri connection to Cosell’s comments.
In 1995 when the Los Angeles Rams moved to St. Louis various news reports cited the reason as financial frustrations about Los Angeles.
Twenty years later, the Rams abandoned Missouri citing inadequate fan support and because city funding for the St. Louis Stadium was not good enough. The team moved back to Califonia.
Ultimately, St. Louis won a $790 million lawsuit award from the Rams to cover the costs for the Rams failing to meet financial requirements for stadium improvements.
The latest team to depart Missouri is the Kansas City Chiefs. They abandoned Kansas City’s Arrowhead Stadium after voters defeated a sales tax proposal for stadium improvements.
The Chiefs will move to a new stadium in Kansas.
The Kansas City Star reports the move could cost Kansas more than $6 billion to build the new stadium.
Beyond that, the Star reports that the Kansas financial incentive for the Chief’s to move could end a restriction on state tax incentives to stop “boarder war” raids that entice a business in one state to move.
It makes me wonder about the potential costs and legal fights if the Kansas Kansas City Chiefs seek to move from Kansas back to Arrowhead Stadium in Missouri.
And of course, an abandoned football stadium in St. Louis and at Kansas City’s Arrowhead might intice teams from across the country to jump at the opportunity if, of course, there are sufficient financial incentives.
If you read various stories about tax funding for NFL teams, you’ll read a reference to STARBonds to entice relocation to Kansas.
They are bonds issued to finance a private project, like a football stadium, that are funded by additional sales taxes collected within the district.
I write this column from the perspective listening to legislative debates about the advantages to provide tax breaks for various private financial interests.
From my hours reading Cosell’s arguments and listening to him on Monday Night Football, I gained a far better understanding about the danger of committing government funds to private sports operations that are free to leave for other locations.
As a footnote, the move from Missouri for more financial benefits has lost the state two Super Bowl champions.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/020925Arrowhead4-1024x614.jpg,,,2026-01-17 07:56:12.935161

And with that, let’s get started.
 Idaho Gov. Little delivers State of the State, and the budget dominates legislative conversations in week one

The state budget – and projected multi-million dollar budget deficits for the current 2026 fiscal year and the upcoming 2027 fiscal year – have taken center stage in the Statehouse as the legislative session gets underway.
Idaho Gov. Brad Little submits plan to balance state budget without repealing Medicaid expansion

Very few bills were introduced or acted on this first week, but there was plenty of discussion about how the state is situated financially.
Is it a big deal that the state is facing a projected $40.3 million budget deficit for 2026 and a $555.2 million deficit for 2027? That depends on whom you ask.
Idaho House Speaker Mike Moyle, R-Star, said Monday that he’s tired of the negative talk surrounding the state budget deficit. So are other Republicans in legislative leadership.
“This isn’t a big deal,” Moyle said at a GOP press conference. “It’s going to be easy to get through.” 
 
But Democrats and some advocacy groups, especially groups that focus on Idahoans’ access to health care, paint a different picture entirely.
They say the budget crunch is self-inflicted due to the $450 million in tax cuts and tax credits approved by the Legislature and Idaho Gov. Brad Little in 2025, as well as $4 billion in income tax cuts that have been approved by lawmakers over the past five years.
They say the plans to close the gap, including the governor’s proposal to cut about $45 million from the state’s Medicaid program’s budget, harm everyday Idahoans who rely on those essential services. Some of those proposals include cuts to Medicaid’s dentistry services and cuts to programs that support people with disabilities.
Some Republicans, including Moyle, have said they would consider a full repeal of Medicaid expansion, which is how approximately 90,000 Idahoans access health insurance across the state.
While Little said he was not looking to repeal Medicaid expansion, and did not include full repeal in his budget proposal, House Minority Leader Ilana Rubel, D-Boise, said she is still deeply concerned about the impact of the budget cuts Idaho legislators will make to balance the budget. 
“We are in a hole,” Rubel said at a Jan. 8 press conference. “There’s no question about it. We are $555 million below what we need to cover the most basic maintenance budgets to keep the lights on in our agencies.”
 When should Idaho legislators set a state revenue projection?

The Legislature’s powerful budget committee, the Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, has fielded recent criticism from legislators of both parties and from stakeholders around Idaho because it set the state’s revenue projection late in the session last year. Essentially, critics say, the budget committee and Legislature passed tax cuts before having a clear picture of how much revenue the state had coming into its coffers and therefore didn’t know if the state could truly afford those cuts.
And after the budget committee met on Friday, some legislators are worried that a similar situation is playing out again in 2026.
On Thursday, the Economic Outlook and Revenue Assessment Committee voted to recommend a revenue projection of $5.8 billion for next year. Notably, that revenue target is about $137 million more than the revenue projection Gov. Little issued Monday in conjunction with his State of the State address.
The budget committee was scheduled to consider the revenue projection on Friday morning. However, without any public explanation, JFAC leaders started Friday’s meeting about 20 minutes late, pulled back their agenda for the day and removed the agenda item for the Economic Outlook and Revenue Assessment Committee’s report.
After Friday’s meeting adjourned, JFAC co-chairmen Sen. Scott Grow and Rep. Josh Tanner, both R-Eagle, said they wanted to give JFAC members more time to study the revenue recommendation, and it’s back on the agenda for JFAC on Monday.

Senate Pro Tem Kelly Anthon, R-Burley, at a Jan. 8 press conference, said setting the revenue projection early in the session is top of mind for legislative leaders.
“We’ve decided, as majority leadership, to try to do a better job this session (by) really hitting the revenue projection early and to work better with the governor’s office to try to get to that revenue number quickly,” Anthon said. “We’ll see how that goes, but that is the goal.”

In the State of the State Address, the governor said while this may be a tighter budget year than lawmakers have experienced in the recent past, he stressed the state is fiscally sound.
“The proof is clear – Idaho’s fundamentals remain among the strongest in the nation,” Little said. “Your dollar stretches farther here than anywhere else. Our unemployment rate is among the lowest in the nation. We lead in personal income growth, and our economic activity continues to outpace most states, reflecting a diverse and resilient economy. Jobs are growing, and Idaho’s healthy business climate remains a magnet for employers, talent, and investment.”
 What to expect next week at the Idaho Legislature

Quick note: Many committees, especially at the beginning of the session, have agenda items known as an RS (which stands for routing slip). That’s legislative talk for “draft legislation.” An RS is not a public record until a committee votes to introduce the bill. Many of those agenda items are only listed by subject matter, so it’s impossible to ascertain what the RS is specifically about, other than the few words used to describe the RS until the introductory hearing takes place.

 Quote of the week

“Our plan uses a responsible mix of one-time and ongoing spending reductions to keep the budget structurally sound. Across state government, executive agencies will tighten their belts. We’re renegotiating contracts to save money. We’re reprioritizing initiatives. We’re finding operational efficiencies, and we will make disciplined use of cash balances and interest earnings. All of this serves to limit the impact on Idahoans as we right-size government.” – Idaho Gov. Brad Little in his 2026 State of the State address

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)While Maine began bracing this week for a suspected increase in immigration operations, local organizers have been preparing for this for months, or years if factoring in the longstanding immigrant rights organizations propping the work up.
Since the launch of an ICE watch hotline in October, more than 300 Mainers have now been trained by community groups to help verify reports of enforcement activity across the state and de-escalate tense situations. Their work has already begun and the number of people signing up to get involved continues to grow, said Crystal Cron, executive director of Presente! Maine. 
The hotline, organized by the Maine Immigrant Rights Coalition and People’s Coalition for Safety and Justice of which Presente! is a part, is also often used by the loved ones of people who have been detained to help connect them with financial, legal and other resources. 
“In times like these, when people are afraid and there’s a lot of reactivity,” Cron said, what’s essential is “staying rooted in the systems that we’ve created.” 
The hotline is one aspect of a multi-organization, grassroots effort to document federal activities and support immigrants in Maine against unlawful action. 
There is a solidarity fund to cover legal representation for people who are detained, volunteers who watch over students and their families during school drop off and pick up, networks to bring food and other necessities to people afraid to leave their homes, and protests.
All of this work is being done with little information about the scope of the suspected immigration operations coming to Maine. 
The mayors of Maine’s two largest cities announced Wednesday that they’re expecting increased federal immigration presence in their communities soon. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has neither confirmed nor denied plans. Gov. Janet Mills and members of Maine’s congressional delegation have also been unable to get confirmation. 
This comes after a particular ramp up of operations in Minnesota, after a federal agent shot and killed Minneapolis resident Renee Good. The Trump administration has sent as many as 3,000 federal agents to Minnesota, nearly five times the total sworn officers in the city’s police department. 
With the surge in federal officers there, ICE arrests have become quicker and quieter as agents avoid drawing crowds. ICE and Border Patrol have also been documented scanning the streets for people who may be immigrants, then asking those people to provide documentation. The American Civil Liberties Union is alleging immigration authorities are racially profiling Minnesota residents and detaining people with legal status, including citizens, in a lawsuit filed Thursday.
Without a sense yet of what may be in Maine’s future, organizers like Cron are prioritizing information gathering and meeting people’s basic needs. And, much of this work is rooted in previous iterations of mutual aid efforts.
For Presente!, which began during the COVID-19 pandemic to provide food and resources to immigrants and others in need with schools closed and fear of exposure to the virus. 
“We’re hearing the same thing again,” Cron said, “but this time, the pathogen is ICE and racism.” 
Presente! and other community groups in the coalition began preparing for Trump’s mass deportation effort as soon as they saw the possibility coming.










We're hearing the same thing again, but this time, the pathogen is ICE and racism.


– Crystal Cron of Presente! Maine


Safiya Khalid, executive director of the Community Organizing Alliance, a Lewiston-based group boosting civic engagement among Black and immigrant communities, spearheaded the establishment of that coalition when Trump was reelected in 2024.
“We needed a plan and a strategy in place to support communities,” Khalid said, who was also the first Somali-American to serve on the Lewiston City Council. 
Khalid’s days are now busy further refining that strategy, but also filled with anxieties over what could happen. 
The Trump administration’s increased operations in Minneapolis specifically target Somali immigrants because of alleged welfare abuse. Similar accusations are being leveled in Maine.
Fear in Maine is visible. In Portland earlier this week, the superintendent reported multiple students absent from each school, citing concerns about immigration enforcement. A local school watch group started after a parent was detained by ICE in September after dropping off their child at a Portland elementary school. 
The team at Khmer Maine, a Portland-based nonprofit serving the state’s Cambodian community, is reviewing their safety protocols to ensure its programming — such as citizenship preparatory courses and cultural events — can continue to be held without risking attendees safety. 
“We’re worried, of course,” said Executive Director Marpheen Chann, “but at the same time, what gives us comfort at Khmer Maine is that we’re not alone,” speaking to the broad network of organizations preparing for ICE’s arrival.

Chann is also running for Cumberland County commissioner, specifically to try to end the county jail’s contract with federal authorities to house immigration detainees. 
A group called No ICE for Maine has been turning out hundreds of people to board meetings to call for the contract’s termination, arguing that cooperation with federal immigration authorities makes the county complicit with their increasingly aggressive tactics. 
That push feels even more urgent now for member Jack O’Brien. “We hope the commissioners understand that this is why we’ve been talking about this for eight months,” O’Brien said. “There’s been a real frustration, I think, with a lot of the public that the commissioners have not taken the concerns about ICE as being legitimate.”
O’Brien, who is also a trained verifier for the hotline, has been connecting with anti-ICE protestors in Minnesota and elsewhere to get advice. He believes Maine’s organizing infrastructure sets the state up to be more proactive than other states. Part of that, he said, is because Maine is smaller than Minneapolis or Los Angeles, which has also faced major immigration raids. 
“It’s also that we’ve been able to learn from them as this horror has continued for them,” O’Brien said.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/img_6435_720.jpg,,,2026-01-17 06:56:29.966775

The hundreds of Kansas who showed up at the Statehouse on Wednesday for a human rights rally understood that better than most. An array of civic organizations sponsored the event, which featured speakers, songs and chants — including a particularly pungent one directed at U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. Yet the most memorable commentary could be seen throughout the crowd, thanks to dozens of handmade signs.
These signs, fashioned from poster board or even plain cardboard, varied in complexity. Some were colorful and artistic, others were hurriedly scrawled. What they shared was visceral outrage at our state and nation’s drift toward authoritarian violence. Most sharply criticized he Trump administration’s deployment of ICE agents against immigrants and protesters.
The death of Minneapolis mother Renee Good fueled Kansans’ anger. However, the crowd understood it as part of a broader effort, one meant to muffle resistance and grab ever more power for White House commissars.
Here at the Kansas Reflector opinion section, we talk about raising the voices of residents who would other not otherwise hear or see themselves in the mainstream media. We work “to amplify the voices of people who are affected by public policies or excluded from public debate,” as the blurb repeated underneath every column says.
In the interest of fulfilling that mission, I hereby present a sign roundup from the Wednesday protest.

Shared concerns
Throughout 2025, I thought we had reached various turning points against President Donald Trump‘s administration. There were the crude cuts by Elon Musk‘s Department of Governmental Efficiency. There were the attempted deportations of various legal immigrants. On the postive side, there were the October No Kings protests.
While all these events dinged Trump‘s popularity, it wasn’t until the government shut down that his administration finally took a serious hit.
The ongoing ICE raids — following a year of harsh tactics — have brought us to another fraught moment. In you listen closely, you can hear a difference in the way that even the most diehard Republicans talk about immigration and efforts at immigration enforcement.
Exhibit A? Longtime reporter Roy Wenzl’s story for the Journal of the Kansas Leadership Center: “Does Kansas need its immigrants despite crackdown? Key business leaders say ‘yes’ ”
Businesses, immigrants and community activists all agree that the current system doesn’t work. That was also the immigration system under former President Joe Biden and his predecessors. While many hoped that Trump would fix well-documented problems, he has instead spread chaos.
I don’t expect that Wenzl’s Republican sources will join demonstrators at the Statehouse anytime soon. However, their calls for a just and humane approach suggest that less division exists than generally supposed.
“Nobody from a city wants to move to western Kansas and work in slaughterhouses,” former state Sen. John Doll, R-Garden City, told the reporter. “It’s absurd to say those workers could be replaced by citizens. If they leave, southwest Kansas with its meatpacking plants will become a series of ghost towns.”
Most Americans, liberals and conservatives, Democrats and Republicans, want an approach to immigration that recognizes those who have spent years or decades in this country. A similarly broad coalition wants smart and effective security at our nation’s borders.
I doubt Trump or ICE will bring us to that space of agreement and compromise anytime soon. In fact, both seem dedicated to fanning the flames.
But underneath it all, the hope for something better remains.

Wes Moore joined 12 governors and two Trump administration officials pushing for power grid operator PJM Interconnection to bring $15 billion worth of new power online — with data centers paying the tab. PJM responded with its own plan.,"The massive computing power of data centers comes with a massive demand for energy, driving up demand for electricity and raising costs on all customers. Multistate electricity grid operator PJM and state and federal officials have their own ideas on how to fix that. (Photo courtesy U.S. Department of Energy)Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D) found himself in a rare position Friday: Joining forces with President Donald Trump’s (R) administration on energy policy.
Moore was one of 13 governors who signed an agreement with the Trump administration, pushing for PJM Interconnection, the operator of the nation’s largest electric grid, to bring $15 billion worth of new power online — with data center companies paying the tab.
Moore has been a critic of PJM, arguing that its policies delayed new clean energy projects, which got stuck in a backlogged queue waiting for approval, and then electricity demand skyrocketed because of power-hungry data centers.
“I have been crystal clear: We cannot build a 21st-century economy on an energy market that blocks new supply,” Moore said in a statement Friday. “This moment calls for urgency. Maryland families and businesses must be served by a reliable grid without shouldering the cost of sky-high energy bills.”
But PJM’s Board of Directors released its own data center plan later Friday.
That plan also initiated a “backstop procurement” for new energy. But PJM merely directed its staff to study assigning the costs of new energy to the jurisdictions, who could then pass those costs to the data center companies, such as Amazon and Google.
PJM’s plan also encourages — but doesn’t mandate — “bring your own generation,” wherein data centers could choose to bring new power onto the system on an expedited basis, to defray the possibility of being asked to reduce their power demand when the grid is strained.

“This decision is about how PJM integrates large new loads in a way that preserves reliability for customers while creating a predictable, transparent path for growth,” said David Mills, PJM Board Chair and Interim President and CEO, in a statement.
“This is not a yes/no to data centers,” Mills’ statement said. “This is, ‘How can we do this while keeping the lights on and recognizing the impact on consumers at the same time?’ We look forward to implementing, along with our stakeholders, these proposals to manage the phenomenal demand growth we are experiencing.”
PJM’s plan also includes changes to the way that the grid operator forecasts energy demand. Concerns had been raised that PJM’s projections were inflated, because companies looking to build data centers could be shopping the same data center proposal in more than one jurisdiction.
According to a news release from PJM, some of the items will require approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, while others can take place immediately.
Environmental groups argued Friday that PJM’s data center plan favors fossil fuels.
The Natural Resources Defense Council said in a statement that PJM’s decision protects “everyday families from blackouts” caused by data centers, but it falls short when it comes to new power generation.
PJM has created a “fast-track process that effectively excludes clean energy projects and gives special treatment to fossil fuel power plants built for data centers, allowing them to cut ahead of low-cost clean resources that have been waiting years to connect to the grid,” wrote Claire Lang-Ree, advocate for the Sustainable FERC Project at NRDC.
Maryland Del. Lorig Charkoudian (D- Montgomery) also chimed in, adding that PJM’s decision doesn’t provide sufficient protections for ratepayers.
“The primary fast-tracking of energy PJM is doing is biased towards fossil gas,” wrote Charkoudian, vice chair of the House Economic Matters Committee. “Given that solar and batteries are the fastest, cheapest way to provide new generation, this is another example of PJM serving for-profit energy companies and not families who can’t afford their energy bill.”

A Trump spokesperson called the administration’s plan with the governors an “unprecedented bi-partisan effort urging PJM to fix the energy subtraction failures of the past, prevent price increases, and reduce the risk of blackouts.”
“Ensuring the American people have reliable and affordable electricity is one of President Trump’s top priorities, and this would deliver much-needed, long-term relief to the Mid-Atlantic region,” wrote White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers in a statement.
The governors’ proposal would also have extended a cap on PJM’s energy capacity auction, which has lowered the price charged to ratepayers from the last several auctions, during which PJM procures energy supply to feed the grid in the future.
But PJM decided to request additional feedback about the cap before making a final decision.
Meanwhile, PJM executive director Jason Stanek was in Annapolis on Friday, speaking to a panel of legislators from Maryland, Pennsylvania and New Jersey, convened by Maryland’s conservative Freedom Caucus.
Stanek, a former Maryland utility regulator, argued that PJM has pursued multiple reforms to approve new energy projects more quickly.
“Despite what you may have heard, our interconnection queue is open, and PJM has been processing the connection of new, and mostly renewable, resources to connect to the grid at record pace,” Stanek said. “We soon hope to turn around requests in a period of one to two years, or possibly sooner.”
During his remarks, Stanek said that states own part of the blame for energy supply worries — and high electric bills, citing state-level energy policies and permitting procedures. He urged the legislators in the room to look inward as they aim to reduce prices.
“We would implore all of our states in the PJM region not to retire any more [power] resources until you have a sufficient amount of resources to backfill those retirements,” Stanek said.
Del. Mark Fisher (R-Calvert) speaks following a panel on energy affordability, convened by the Maryland Freedom Caucus with Republicans from other states in the PJM network. (Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)
“We would also ask that you look at your state permitting laws on the books to determine whether or not we can actually build energy infrastructure in your states in a timely manner.”
The Republicans in attendance were insistent that Maryland has contributed to its own power woes, by passing legislation to push the state away from fossil fuels — and toward a grid fueled by solar, wind and nuclear power. By law, Maryland has until 2031 to cut its carbon emissions 60% from 2006 levels.
“Why would politicians push to force the economy onto electricity while simultaneously shutting down the very power plants needed to generate it? It’s simple. Virtue signaling, green dreams over common sense,” said Del. Mark Fisher (R-Calvert).
Senate Minority Leader Steve Hershey (R-Upper Shore) said Friday that he was initially encouraged by the PJM governors’ announcement, because he agrees that data centers should pay for new power. But he remains concerned that Moore will focus on renewable sources, such as wind and solar, to supply that new power to the grid.
“Gov. Moore needs to embrace natural gas,” Hershey said. “He hasn’t done it yet. He’s trying to talk about nuclear, because it’s clean, but nuclear is 12 or 15 years out. As we heard today in this hearing, the quickest way to get reliable energy back on grid is to open up these retired fossil fuel generation facilities.”

This year, they are back with proposals, many of which are aimed at protecting their constituents from immigration raids that have put entire communities on edge.","A protester holds up a sign during a rally last month in support of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Maryland resident whose detention and deportation became a national proxy for the debate over Trump administration immigration policy. (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)One recent morning, Del. Gabriel Acevero (D-Montgomery) opened his computer to an email from a desperate family:  “Please help us locate our elderly family friend who has been detained,” it read.
“This is the moment we are in right now,” says Acevero, who serves as vice chair of the Maryland Latino Legislative Caucus. “We serve as the voice of the Latino and immigrant community to assure that we are reflecting their concerns and aspirations with legislation and a budget that is fair, equitable and meets the moment.”
Acevero says the caucus can use its 91 members – the largest caucus in Annapolis – to leverage its priorities to address fears like those in that short note.
In 2025, caucus members voted to support 55 pieces of legislation. Included in the 20 that were ultimately signed into law were inclusive policies for returning citizens, anti-poverty and housing policies, health care access, child welfare and transportation safety. Some that did not succeed last year have already been reintroduced this year and pushed to the top of the caucus’ agenda.
According to a Brookings Institution report, Maryland’s Latino community had a growth spurt in 2025 attracting 32,646 new residents, adding to the approximately 800,000 already living across the state, but largely in Montgomery and Prince George’s counties.
Barring police agreements with ICE
Acevero says in 2026 the caucus is resolute in its mission to combat federal government measures that target Latinos. That focus is on immigrant protection with three key bills. One would prohibit 287(g) agreements,  the collaborative agreements between local law enforcement agencies and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). That provision was stripped from the 2025 Maryland Values Act on the last day of the 2o25 session.
More than 3,300 Marylanders were detained by ICE in 2025, twice the number of preceding years

Del. Nicole Williams (D-Prince Georges), who sponsored the Values Act, says she will reintroduce the 287(g) measure as a standalone bill.  “I am very optimistic that it will pass because we have really great partners in the Senate who are committed to ensuring that this bill passes this session,” she said.
Among those partners is Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City). Another is House Speaker Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George’s), who told Maryland Matters, that she also supports the measure.
“I think it’s important, especially given the climate that we have presently in this country,” said Peña-Melnyk, a native of the Dominican Republic. “The states have to act. This is a way for us to tell our immigrant community, ‘We love you. You’re part of us. We see you. We hear you, and we want to give you protection,’ and that’s why this is important.”
Williams anticipates opposition from the Maryland counties that have signed 287(g) cooperative agreements, eight in total. Arguing for their termination, she says the stand-alone bill promotes greater trust and better relations with the police in the long run.
“We want to make sure that people feel comfortable reporting crimes to the police, engaging with our local officers, and that our officers are engaging in community policing, where the community feels as though they are part of it,” Williams said.
Other priority protection bills
Two other bills among caucus priorities include House Bill 155, also drafted by Williams, which would bar on-duty law enforcement officers from wearing masks or disguises when interacting with the public. Senate Bill 1 is the companion measure in the Senate.
The other from Del. Vaughn Stewart (D-Montgomery) would bar ICE arrests in courthouses. The measure would build on the sensitive location guidelines of the Maryland Values Act that restricts federal enforcement agents from schools, churches, libraries, places of worship, hospitals, clinics and community shelters.
Among the caucus members seven are of Latino heritage – the other 84 associate members support caucus priorities.  They have crafted dozens of bills, which at their core are immigrant related, but have a broader reach. “I’m coming into this session with a pretty comprehensive agenda around affordability and workers’ rights,” said Del. Joe Vogel (D-Montgomery), whose parents brought him to the United States from Uruguay at age 3 in 2000.

Elected to the House in 2022, he is now the caucus secretary. “I spent the last nine months, both here in my district – Gaithersburg and Rockville – and then in other parts of the state hearing directly from Marylanders, from immigrants, who are really hurting now, fearful of the federal government and struggling to keep up with the rising cost of living,” he said.
Caucus Treasurer Del. Deni Taveras, a Dominican American, also has several prospective bills with immigrants in mind, ranging from developmental disability service for Latino families, an anti-price gouging housing bill, and legislation around teen pregnancy, chronic truancy and drug addiction among Latinos.
‘We cannot afford to be silent’
Caucus delegate Teresa Woorman (D-Montgomery) immigrated from Puebla, Mexico, as a child, became a naturalized citizen in college and served as a long-term staffer in the General Assembly before she began her first term as a legislator in 2025.
This year she strongly supports the Latino Caucus agenda, with bills of her own that include working with Peña-Melnyk to tweak a law that would put in-state tuition for undocumented students on parity with neighboring states.
She says while her constituents live in Bethesda and Potomac, areas with much less threatened by ICE,  “When I go door-knocking, people are worried about what they see on their TVs, what’s happening across the whole country,” she said.  “And I tell them I feel like we are [in Annapolis] as the first line of defense to protect what we can at the state level.”
Acevedo is ready for the fight.
“What we are seeing is a federal government that is targeting hard working Marylanders and immigrants who have come to this country and who have called this country home for decades,” he said.  “We are going to continue to push legislation, raise our voices. We are going to be in the streets shoulder to shoulder with our partners and our allies to call out this administration.  We cannot afford to be silent.”

Sandy Bartlett (D-Anne Arundel) has reason to smile after being elevated from vice chair of the House Judiciary Committee last year to chair this year, the first woman and first person of color to hold the seat. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)The Department of Legislative Services is the keeper of all legislative arcana, among other things. So it was able to respond relatively quickly this week to a request for information about House Judiciary Committee leadership, spitting out a list of chairs — or, more strictly, chairmen — dating back to 1828.
They might want to put an asterisk next to this year’s entry.
Del. J. Sandy Bartlett (D-Anne Arundel), recently elevated from vice chair of Judiciary, is not just the first woman to make that 198-year list of committee chairs, she is also the first person of color to chair the committee. She was appointed by new House Speaker Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel), who made former Judiciary Chair Del. Luke Clippinger (D-Baltimore City) her speaker pro tem.
Del. Debra Davis (D-Charles) was named vice chair, making the Judiciary Committee the only standing committee this year chaired by two Black women.
“We have quite a team. We have the dream team here, I hope. I think we do,” Bartlett said during an organizational hearing for the committee this week.
“We do,” Davis replied.
In an interview Friday, Bartlett said she was grateful for the chance to serve as chair, which she said comes with a “strong sense of responsibility.” She said she thinks about her ancestors when serving in the legislature, including her great-grandfather Bryant William Thorpe, one of four Black state legislators in North Carolina in 1885.
Peña-Melnyk unveils House leadership shake-up, expands standing committees

“I am just so grateful. It hasn’t even really completely hit me yet because I stand on the shoulders of other people, but I know it’s special,” Bartlett said. “I know it’s historic, and I appreciate it.”
It’s not the first committee to be led by two Black women: Last year, the House Ways and Means Committee was chaired by Del. Vanessa Atterbeary (D-Howard) and the vice chair was Del. Jheanelle Wilkins (D-Montgomery). When Atterbeary stepped down this year to focus on her race for Howard County executive, Wilkins was made chair. Her vice chair is Del. Jessica Feldmark (D-Howard).
The only other standing committee led by two Black legislators is Senate Executive Nominations chaired by Sen. Benjamins Brooks (D-Baltimore County) and Sen. C. Anthony Muse (D-Prince George’s) as the vice chair.
Burning the candle at both ends
The Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee got its nickname, “JPR after dark,” for its habit of holding hearings well into the night to handle its significant workload during previous legislative sessions.
Now, it appears the committee has started burning the candle at both ends.
Committee Manager Sandy Popp informed the committee during an organizational meeting Thursday that the committee had already scheduled 58 prefiled bills to be heard this month, a little more than a fifth of the 273 bills that had been submitted to the full Senate as of Friday. Popp said that’s down from the 75 prefiled bills the committee started with last year.
Hearings will begin Tuesday and be packed in over the next 10 days. (The Senate Education, Energy and the Environment Committee is keeping pace with 65 bill hearings scheduled, but those start Wednesday and are currently scheduled through mid-February.)
“The work that we do here is, I think, most directly connected to how people move about their everyday lives, and you’ll see that through testimony,” said Sen. William C. Smith Jr. (D-Montgomery), chair of the committee.
And the committee has not packed the calendar with softball bills. About 31 bills will be reviewed next week on topics that include estates and trusts, family law and criminal law. But there is also a potentially a high-octane hearing Thursday when the committee hears Senate Bill 1, prohibiting face coverings for law enforcement officers in the state, including U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers; and SB 245, prohibiting a county sheriff, local police or any “agent of the state” from entering into an agreement with the federal government to enforce civil immigration law.

Put simply, SB 245 would ban 287(g) agreements with ICE. That language was stripped out of larger bill on the last day of the 2025 session, original sponsor Sen. Karen Lewis Young (D-Frederick) reintroduced it this year with two heavyweight co-sponsors: Smith, the committee chair, and Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City).
SB 1, sponsored by Sen. Malcolm Augustine (D-Prince George’s),follows months of aggressive immigration raids by ICE agents who are typically masked. The scrutiny intensified after Renee Good, 37, was shot and killed by an ICE agent in Minneapolis this month. Augustine’s bill would prohibit officers from wearing items such as a balaclava, ski mask or neck gaiter on duty. It wouldn’t apply to an individual “actively engaged in an undercover operation.”
Ferguson and Pena-Melnyk have both expressed support for the measure.
“I think all of us can sit back and imagine if you’re sitting in your car and somebody runs up to you, even as a law enforcement agent that quickly shows us a badge and has their face covered, I know I would be terrified,” Ferguson said Wednesday to reporter. “It’s just not how you build trust in policing.”
But Sen. William G. Folden (R-Frederick), a Judicial Proceedings member who recently retired from the Frederick Police Department, said law enforcement officers in the state usually do not wear face coverings unless it’s due to inclement weather. He said masked federal officers “are trying to actually find a way to protect themselves and their families from being doxed by certain activists who make it their mission to cause disruption … in the performance of their duties.”
“I find it interesting that the state of Maryland wants to legislate a policy for federal law enforcement officers,” Folden said.
Bartlett could not say when the House version of the masking bill, sponsored by Del. Nicole Williams (D-Prince George’s), might be heard in the Judiciary Committee.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)A federal judge gave a significant victory to Minnesota protesters and observers of federal officers Friday, granting a preliminary injunction preventing the officers from retaliating against demonstrators.
The ruling by U.S. District Judge Kate Menendez prevents the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement from arresting or detaining people who are engaging in peaceful and unobstructive protest including observing Operation Metro Surge, which is the feds’ name for the incursion of 3,000 immigration officers and agents here. The Reformer talked to a protester who was detained for hours on Sunday and never charged.
The federal agents can no longer use pepper spray or other nonlethal munitions against people engaged in peaceful protest. They cannot stop or detain drivers where there is no “reasonable, articulable suspicion” that they are interfering.
ICE observers are frequently following cars they suspect are being driven by federal officers, tracking them, entering vehicle descriptions into a database and discouraging them from making immigrant arrests. The judge declared this legal and a protected activity: “The act of safely following (federal agents) at an appropriate distance does not, by itself, create reasonable suspicion to justify a vehicle stop.”
The ruling comes out of a December lawsuit filed by six plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU.
The six named plaintiffs were all observing ICE last year as the agency ramped up raids in Minnesota, especially in the state’s large Somali community.
Susan Tincher, one of the named plaintiffs, pulled up to the scene of a reported ICE raid in north Minneapolis on Dec. 9 and exited her car. According to the lawsuit, she stood on the sidewalk six feet away from the nearest officer and asked the agents on the scene if they were ICE. The officers moved towards her, ordered her to “get back,” then pulled her to the ground. Officers handcuffed Tincher while she was face-down in the snow, according to video of the event reviewed by the Reformer. 
“I was genuinely afraid I was being kidnapped,” Tincher said at a press conference Wednesday.
The agents took Tincher to the Whipple Federal Building at Fort Snelling; shackled her legs; cut off her wedding ring, bra and boot laces; and held her in a cell for five hours before releasing her.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/NN260107_661-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-16 22:57:57.238603

Pete Ricketts said he encouraged Tyson to keep the plant open and help affected people find jobs.,"A Lexington water tower on Dec. 9, 2025. (Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA  — U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., wrote to Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, asking her federal department to “block” the closure of the Tyson beef plant in Lexington, Nebraska. 
Schumer, in the letter, pointed to the Packers and Stockyards Act, saying the upcoming closure in Lexington is a “textbook violation” of the century-old federal law. The New York Democrat said the closure will send “shockwaves through America’s cattle market.”

“[USDA] publicly stated it is ‘closely monitoring’ the planned closure of large processors like Tyson’s Lexington plant, yet has offered little clarity on whether that monitoring includes active investigation, enforcement, or any concrete steps to protect producers and competition … I urge you to act swiftly to preserve competition, help bring prices down for families and farmers, and save jobs,” Schumer’s letter reads. 
The Packers and Stockyards Act, passed in 1921, was meant to promote competitiveness and fair practices in the livestock, meat and poultry industries — and to ensure payment protection.

The law prohibits deception and fraud in those markets. Some have questioned whether the feds have the authority to do so. The Packers and Stockyards Act does give the Agriculture Department the authority to force Tyson to sell the plant.  
Ricketts, during a campaign event Friday in Omaha, told the Examiner he had talked to Tyson to “encourage them to quickly make a decision about the plant and to keep it open.” He said he also is working to connect people affected by the closure with help finding jobs. 
“I think about the disaster that’s going on in Lexington … like a natural disaster,” Ricketts said, “so it’s locally executed, state supported or state managed, federally supported [and] we’re supporting the state of Nebraska.” 
Lexington is likely see 3,200 workers lose their jobs. The statewide economic loss, including both direct and ripple effects, has been estimated at $3.28 billion a year, according to a University of Nebraska-Lincoln Bureau of Business Research analysis. 
The west-central Nebraska city is home to more than 10,000 people.

State agencies have partnered with Lexington nonprofits and other groups to support the affected workers. Gov. Jim Pillen told the press after his State of the State address that he is “pushing at every meeting” with Tyson to decide the future of the plant “sooner than later.”  
Tyson has not scheduled any shifts at the Lexington facility this week, according to Farm Journal.
The letter from Schumer comes after Ricketts’ Senate race opponent this fall, registered nonpartisan Dan Osborn, used a campaign appearance in Lexington to highlight the plant’s loss. He accused the company of breaking the century-old law. Tyson also is reducing its operations in a plant in Amarillo, in the Texas panhandle.
The Ricketts campaign said Schumer is “amplifying Osborn’s political grandstanding.”  
“Dan Osborn will be a consistent yes vote for Schumer’s far-left agenda. … It’s why Schumer spent $3.85 million on Osborn’s last campaign,” said Will Coup, a Ricketts campaign spokesperson. “Nebraskans will see through these political games.” 
Dan Osborn said the interest from Washington is “too little and too late.”

“The workers and their families in Lexington are the latest to have the rug pulled out from under them by corporate greed. … Where has Pete Ricketts been on all this?” Osborn asked. 
Nebraska also lost a Tyson plant in 2006 in Norfolk. U.S. Rep. Mike Flood, a Republican from Norfolk representing the 1st Congressional District, has said Tyson “stripped the plant bare” and the property couldn’t be used as a beef processing facility. Flood said the plant still sits empty today. 
Tyson’s Lexington plant is set to close next week.

,Mississippi Today,2026-01-17 02:51:34+00:00,Mississippi Today,Ole Miss QB Trinidad Chambliss sues NCAA to seek extra year of eligibility,"Mark Pratt, Associated Press",,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/16/trinidad-chambliss-sues-ncaa/,"Mississippi quarterback Trinidad Chambliss throws during the first half of the Fiesta Bowl NCAA college football playoff semifinal game against Miami, Thursday, Jan. 8, 2026, in Glendale, Ariz.","Mississippi quarterback Trinidad Chambliss sued the NCAA in state court on Friday for an additional year of eligibility so he can play for the Rebels next season.
The suit filed in Lafayette County came a week after the NCAA denied Ole Miss’ request for an extra year, saying the university and Chambliss’ previous school — Ferris State — failed to provide adequate medical documentation to back up the request.
The lawsuit filed Friday called the NCAA’s denial in “bad-faith, unreasonable and arbitrary,” and detailed Chambliss’ history of illness and included letters from physicians.
“Despite the duty of good faith and fair dealing it owes to Trinidad, the NCAA insists on considering the evidence in Trinidad’s case in an isolated, rather than comprehensive manner; interpreting its rules to impose requirements not contained therein; taking unreasonable if not irrational positions; and acting in an arbitrary and capricious manner in its decision-making and ruling,” the suit says.
Ole Miss’ arguments revolve around the fact that the 23-year-old Chambliss, although he has been in college for five years, has only played three years of college football because of that medical history.
“Trinidad first enrolled in Ferris State in the fall of 2021, but medical and physical incapacity prevented his ability to adequately train and condition and develop athletically,” the suit says.
After taking a redshirt his first season at Ferris State in 2021-22, Chambliss was held out in his second season for medical reasons.
“Obviously, Trinidad’s medical conditions, which rendered him incapable of competing in any game during these years, were beyond his or Ferris State’s control,” the suit says.
He played two more seasons at the Division II school in Michigan, leading the Bulldogs to a national championship before transferring to Ole Miss before the start of this season.
Chambliss completed 294 of 445 passes (66.1%) for 3,937 yards with 22 touchdowns and three interceptions for Ole Miss (13-2), which set a school record for wins, including two after making the College Football Playoff for the first time. He ran for 527 yards and eight more TDs.
The Rebels lost 31-27 to Miami in the College Football Playoff semifinals on Jan. 8.
The NCAA, when contacted Friday, did not have a new statement, but referred to its statement from a week ago saying “This decision aligns with consistent application of NCAA rules.”
The NCAA said in that week-old statement that approval of such waivers requires schools to submit medical documentation from a treating physician at the time of a student’s incapacitating injury or illness.
“The documents provided by Ole Miss and the student’s prior school include a physician’s note from a December 2022 visit, which stated the student-athlete was ‘doing very well’ since he was seen in August 2022,” the NCAA said. “Additionally, the student-athlete’s prior school indicated it had no documentation on medical treatment, injury reports or medical conditions involving the student-athlete during that time frame and cited ‘developmental needs and our team’s competitive circumstances’ as its reason the student-athlete did not play in the 2022-23 season.”

Kyrsten Sinema was asked to describe the world’s current chapter in history during a Salt Lake City event, the question was almost unintelligible, obstructed by the yells of a heckler and the quick movement of security officers dragging him outside.
“Disruptive,” Sinema said, “and I promise I didn’t plan for that.”
A few minutes later, a second heckler appeared interrupting the session as well. Both of them yelled they were having affairs with Sinema, a nod to the news of a lawsuit filed against her for “alienation of affection” after being accused of having an affair with a former member of her security team.
Sinema, currently an adviser for a law and lobbying firm and for cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, was visiting Salt Lake City on Friday to speak on a panel about policy and partnerships with Gov. Spencer Cox and Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute Director Natalie Gochnour, part of the Utah Chamber and Gardner Institute’s Utah Economic Outlook and Public Policy Summit.

After the interruptions, Sinema continued her thoughts on what she described as “a period of incredible disruption,” especially with the emergence of artificial intelligence technologies.

“So AI is changing the way that we work and the way that we interact with each other. It will also change the way that we consider jobs,” she said. “Jobs will look different in the future, and there’s always a period of disruption. This has been true since the invention of electricity, right? Since the invention of the internet, right?”
The discussion followed the presentation of the annual Economic Report to the Governor from the Gardner Institute, which made projections of moderate economic expansion for the state throughout 2026. 
The institute also projected 1.3% population growth in Utah from 2026 to 2027 — the same population growth calculated in 2025. That would outpace the national average, but at the same time, represents a slower rate than the state’s historical trend. 
And while the state remains the youngest in the country, the population is aging, reports from the Gardner Institute say.

One of Cox’s concerns, he said on Friday, is to be prepared “when that silver tsunami hits us,” but also, he worries about the decline of the state’s fertility rate.
“Our society is a pyramid scheme. It is, and it always has been, and that’s a very positive thing,” he said, prompting some laughs. “We need those next generations. Now that doesn’t even touch on our social safety nets and what happens when you don’t have the workers who are paying the taxes to deliver the social security that people are relying on to retire, we are screwed if we don’t have that.”
Sinema agreed with Cox, saying that if nothing changes at the federal level, by the time she and the governor reach retirement age, “there will be no social security.”
Cox had mostly kind words for business representatives who attended the summit. But, he finished his remarks warning that he was about to be blunt with them.
“You’ve abandoned us. You have. We do not see the business community on Capitol Hill like we did when I started this 10 years ago. It’s not even close,” he said. “Everybody just kind of does their thing, and they’ll complain about legislation, but they don’t show up.”
He urged them to also find other people to be at the Legislature if they are unhappy with its results.
“Some of you need to run for the Legislature, we need you. We desperately need you,” he said.
Sinema had a similar message, but for everyone in the country.
“If you don’t like the tone, if you don’t like the ugliness, if you think, ‘Gosh, this is distasteful,’ the thing we’ve got to remember is that we as Americans, we built this. This is us,” she said. “We created it, so we choose who we put in these positions. We choose who to reward, we choose who to punish.”
When asked about Utah’s culture and social cohesion, Sinema said that having spent a significant portion of her life in the state, she knows it’s “a very special place.”
“Utahns, with two notable exceptions today,” she said, “are just very generous, kind.”
