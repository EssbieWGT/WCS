Dana Stein (D-Baltimore County) looks on. (Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)Baltimore area officials still want to create some kind of regional body to oversee the area’s water system — just don’t call it a regional water authority.
During the introductory meeting Wednesday of a new work group discussing the matter, Baltimore Comptroller Bill Henry (D), the work group’s chairman, said that a regional water authority is officially off the table.
“That path has since proved prohibitive from several financial and legal perspectives,” Henry said. “Instead, our focus here over the course of the next year will be much more practical, and — hopefully — more achievable.”
During a previous task force convened to discuss the water system — which is largely owned by Baltimore City but serves Baltimore County and other neighboring jurisdictions — officials looked closely at a water authority.
But they discovered several problems that would arise from creating a new, regional entity to handle day-to-day operations for the system, as opposed to Baltimore’s Department of Public Works, which largely runs the system today.
For one thing, the existing debt incurred by the city to run the system would have to be transferred to that new entity, and because much of that debt was incurred when interest rates were substantially lower, doing so would come at an immense cost.

Creating a new entity would also impact employees, who would essentially transfer to a new employer, even if their jobs remained the same. And it would force pension obligations to be relocated as well.
So, Henry says he envisions a new governance structure whereby the city agency would still handle the operations of the system, but it would ultimately answer to a board of officials from around the region, instead of simply Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott (D).
“Right now, DPW just works for the mayor of Baltimore, right? And the director of DPW does what the mayor says,” Henry said in an interview. “What is on the table to change is: The director would do what this regional entity says they should do.”
It remains to be seen precisely what form the new body could take. The new work group is specifically tasked with evaluating whether a “Rate Board,” tasked only with setting utility bills for water, sewer and stormwater, would be a good fit for the region. Currently, much of that power sits with Baltimore’s Board of Estimates.
There is also likely to be significant political grappling over how such a board might be composed, and how many representatives would come from the city, versus the surrounding counties or other entities.
Per a recently released schedule, the new work group plans to release its final report by the end of this year.
The 13-member Baltimore Regional Water Governance Model Work Group is the second cohort to consider Baltimore’s water system over the past several years. Under a 2024 state law, Scott selects five of the 13 members, with three appointed by the Baltimore County executive, two by the governor, one each by the Maryland Senate president and House speaker, and one from Anne Arundel, Carroll, Harford or Howard counties.
The work group’s decision could cap years of tension between city and county about the control of the water system. Infrastructure woes and billing issues have stirred the pot in recent years, but demographic change also lies at the heart of the matter.
The system was constructed by a far larger Baltimore City, which agreed to expand it outward to service Baltimore County as that jurisdiction grew, and to serve other counties, though to a lesser extent. Today, the size of the county far surpasses that of the city, but the city maintains much of the control.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Environmental and ratepayer advocacy groups have previously expressed concern that, even though the city and counties have cost-sharing agreements, city residents bear too much of the cost, and expressed worry that a regional water authority could seize assets from the city, leaving it worse off financially.
So Jorge Aguilar, southern region director at Food and Water Watch, said he was heartened to learn Wednesday that a regional water authority wasn’t in the cards for Baltimore.
“Based on those findings for the first task force on this issue, it was estimated that the creation of the new authority could result in more than $2 billion in transaction costs and could lead to large water bill hikes, water shut offs, privatization, loss of potential unionized positions within the city and within the county government. So again, really glad that is off the table,” Aguilar said.
“We really do hope that the outcome of your deliberations will be to ensure more equity in the cost allocations between the city and the county, while protecting and expanding local control, union jobs and water affordability,” Aguilar said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DSC09916-1024x622.jpeg,,,2026-01-08 19:00:01.891722

Marian Matthews (D-Albuquerque) introduced three medical compact bills ahead of the legislative session, saying the state’s healthcare worker shortage requires the Legislature to enter more than just compacts for doctors and social workers. (Courtesy NM Legislature) After weeks of bipartisan negotiations, state lawmakers this week unveiled legislation intended to make it easier for doctors to practice in New Mexico by entering a multistate medical compact for physicians.
Advocates have lobbied for years that entering the compact — which would allow doctors licensed in other states to practice in New Mexico — will help address the state’s physician shortage, but have faced pushback from some Democratic lawmakers. 
Now one lawmaker from the working group on the issue, Rep. Marian Matthews (D-Albuquerque), said the proposals intended for this session don’t go far enough.
This week, she introduced three bills that would enter the state into three additional health care compacts and is urging her colleagues to at least consider them.
New Mexico Senate majority leader says medical compact legislation ‘close’ ahead of session

“Our health system is in really bad shape right now,” she told Source NM. “I can’t think of a higher priority for us in the coming session but to address solutions to the problem, and compacts are a part of that.” 
Unlike 44 jurisdictions, including New Mexico’s five border states, New Mexico is neither a member of the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact for physicians, nor part of eight other major compacts for paramedics, audiologists, dentists and other specialties, according to Think New Mexico, a nonpartisan advocacy group. 
In response to ongoing pressure from advocates and state Republican lawmakers to allow medical compact legislation a full hearing at the Roundhouse, Senate Majority Leader Peter Wirth (D-Santa Fe) in November convened a six-lawmaker working group composed of Democrats and Republicans in both chambers. 
Members were tasked with crafting legislation that would enter the state into health care licensure compacts amid public outcry over growing wait lists and long drives to access health care across the state. The state lost close to 250 doctors between 2019 and 2024.
Wirth told Source New Mexico that the group, after multiple meetings, succeeded in crafting licensure compact legislation for doctors and social workers, but that other potential compacts need more work and remain “in the pipeline.” Lawmakers are expected to introduce the social worker compact legislation soon.
Wirth has previously described joining compacts as a complex process that requires lawmakers to work closely with managers of each of the licensure organizations individually to ensure legislation meets their requirements but also ensures the state maintains its autonomy. 
But Matthews said she emerged from the working group convinced that joining the compacts is relatively easy and that reconciling the state’s legislation with compact requirements is often a matter of “stylistic” versus “substantive” changes. 
She also is increasingly persuaded the compacts work. She provided Source a list of studies that show immediate increases in health care workers for states that join compacts.
NM Senate Dems unlikely to move on medical compacts for special session

Matthews said she faced pushback in the working group about introducing additional compact bills, but decided, “We need to move forward on this.”
Her legislation would enter New Mexico into compacts for paramedics, counselors and psychologists. 
She told Source she is actively working with managers for each of those compacts, sharing the legislation and seeking assurances that the language meets their requirements. She expects to amend each bill soon after the session starts with any additional notes they provide, she told Source.
Still, Sen. Linda Trujillo (D-Santa Fe), one of the sponsors for the physician compact bill, told Source this week that she doesn’t think the Legislature will have enough time to carefully consider each of Matthews’ compacts.
As evidence, she pointed to the amount of work the doctor compact took, saying the lawmakers and compact managers had to toil over language about, for example, liability for compact board members; the state Medical Board’s subpoena power; and protection of health records, particularly for women and transgender people. Doing that for three other compacts during a 30-day session would be impossible, she said. 
“They’re not ready,” she said of Matthews’ compacts. “We have not had any comprehensive meetings with the organizations on that to make sure that any changes that we make will be accepted.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/matthewsroundhouse-1024x512.png,,,2026-01-08 19:00:01.891722

“Our wealth divide has done nothing but grown,” said Rep. Emilie Kornheiser, who expressed particular concern at some corporate taxes loosening.

That’s what Rep. Emilie Kornheiser, D-Brattleboro, wants the Vermont tax system to be, she said Thursday morning. But following the passage of federal tax law changes in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, she said, that lofty goal may have become harder to ensure. And she worries the changes could threaten the state’s tax revenue, too.
The House Committee on Ways and Means, which Kornheiser chairs, has lost no time this week diving into the weeds of new federal tax law as it weighs what state-level changes might be necessary or feasible. In lieu of regaling each other with news from the summer, Kornheiser asked lawmakers to name their favorite thing about working on tax policy while introducing themselves on Tuesday.  
“This year marks the 50th year I’ve been married to a CPA,” offered Rep. Carolyn Branagan, R-Georgia.
A number of the federal changes, particularly to corporate taxes, will flow through to Vermont’s tax calculation processes. Like many other states, Vermont uses parts of the federal tax system as a baseline for levying its own fees on taxpayers. 
Patrick Titterton, an analyst in the state’s Legislative Joint Fiscal Office, told the committee Tuesday that changes to tax policy in the new federal budget are complex, with some likely to decrease revenue and some expected to increase it. In summary, small $1.3 million and $4.9 million decreases are projected in each of the next two fiscal years, Titterton said, while other impacts will be less immediate as some new measures take effect over the course of up to 10 years.
Corporate income tax, a notably fickle revenue source, Titterton said Thursday, is projected to provide roughly 10% of Vermont’s General Fund revenue in the 2026 fiscal year.
State lawmakers have decided before that federal tax changes are not in Vermont’s interest. In a 2018 special session, lawmakers “uncoupled” Vermont’s tax code from certain federal provisions around personal income tax. For now, Kornheiser said the state remains much more bound to Washington, D.C., when it comes to corporate taxes.
For Kornheiser, it’s potentially an equity issue.
“Our wealth divide has done nothing but grown,” she said. “The Trump administration’s tax work just did even more to exacerbate that.”

In the know
Flanked by a real who’s-who of health care advocates today, State Treasurer Mike Pieciak held a press conference championing H.577, a bill that his office has steered that aims to bring down the price of prescription drugs.
The bill, sponsored by House Health Care Committee chair Rep. Alyssa Black, D-Essex Town, and Rep. Daisy Berbeco, D-Winooski, proposes Vermont join a coalition of states — Oregon, Washington, Arizona, Nevada and Connecticut — to pool drug purchasing power, negotiate lower costs and secure bulk discounts. Joining the group would come at no cost to the state, but the bill would allocate $50,000 for the Treasurer’s Office to develop and promote the program.
If the state were to join, anyone in Vermont could receive a free drug discount card and use it instead of insurance when buying a medication. Pieciak said he especially hopes this helps those whose prescriptions may not be covered by Medicare, individuals who have dropped their commercial insurance or those who opted for a less-comprehensive plan. 
Still to come as the bill works its way through the House Health Care Committee: more discussion on whether paying out-of-pocket can count toward one’s deductible.

On the move
The Senate voted to send a bill that would require disclosures on certain AI-generated media back to its Government Operations Committee on Thursday. The committee will review the changes the House made to the bill, S.23, before that chamber passed the measure last year. The Senate never took up the House’s changes before adjourning for 2025. 
Sen. Brian Collamore, R-Rutland, the gov ops chair, said in an interview his committee would take testimony on the House’s revisions next week. He said he did not expect the changes would be controversial and that the bill would likely make it back to the floor.
Both the House and Senate versions of S.23 would require certain publishers of images created using AI — and that depict political candidates — to also attach a message stating that the content is fake. The disclosure requirement would apply to these “deepfakes,” as they’re often called, only when they are published within 90 days of an election.

Too hot to handle
Statehouse regulars who opt to bring their own lunch have probably noticed a change in the building this week — there is no longer a microwave available for public use in the cafeteria. Safe to say, the appliance’s sudden disappearance has been a cause of consternation, if not at least several cold meals of leftover takeout.
Sitting in its place is a rather ominous sign from the Sergeant-at-Arms’ Office:
“The microwave in this location was destroyed,” it reads. “At this time, there are no plans to replace the microwave due to continued maintenance and fire-related issues. Thank you.”
Turns out, “fire-related issues” is a polite way of saying that food-reheaters have been responsible for two of the three total fires in the Statehouse over the past year, Sergeant-at-Arms Agatha Kessler said Thursday. The latter of those two conflagrations, she said, caused the appliance’s untimely demise.
Kessler said the fires had taken up a significant amount of emergency responders’ time and resources, which for her outweighed the benefits of keeping the microwave in use. She noted, too, that there are other microwaves located around the building that people can use.
The extent to which those other microwaves are publicly accessible is, sort of, a matter of perspective. It is The People’s House, after all. My advice: Use the one a short walk from the cafeteria in the alcove past the House Commerce and House Corrections rooms.
But maybe follow the advice on the appliance’s door: Use a lid!

Pennie enrollment drops as Congress wrestles with health insurance subsidy vote,Whitney Downard,,,,,https://penncapital-star.com/health-care/pa-pennie-enrollment-drops-as-congress-wrestles-with-health-insurance-subsidy-vote/,"So far, an estimated 70,000 Pennsylvanians have ended their coverage, with between 465,000 and 472,000 enrolled as of this week.","A Pennie sign seen at the 2026 Pennsylvania Farm Show on Jan. 8, 2026. (Photo by Whitney Downard/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)Thousands of Pennsylvanians have left the state’s only Affordable Care Act marketplace, Pennie, following sharp increases in monthly premiums due to expiring enhanced federal subsidies. 
Pennie numbers continue to fluctuate as the U.S. House voted Thursday to extend benefits for moderate-income enrollees for three more years. The measure moves to the Senate and, if approved, would need to be signed by President Donald Trump before the subsidies take effect. At least 70,000 Pennsylvania residents have left the exchange so far. 
For those still enrolled, rising costs means cutting expenses elsewhere. 
Andrew Gehman, who lives in Franklin County, told the Capital-Star that he’d ended a $12,000 contract with a salesperson after his premium jumped from $70 to $240. Gehman, 40, owns and operates a video production company, 2085 Productions, based in Waynesboro, pitching projects from Washington, D.C. to Philadelphia. 
“It’s essential. I had to go to the emergency room six, seven years ago when I didn’t have health insurance … and I think the hospital bill was $6,000 or $7,000,” Gehman said. “I was out of work at the time, so it was 100% (covered by) financial assistance.”
“But the reality is, this is why you need health insurance,” he continued. “Because the whoopsies, the mistakes, the accidents happen.”










We’re just hearing a lot of anxiety and concern from people around the trade-offs that they’re going to have to make financially and the risk that they have to take with their health if they end up going uninsured.


– Pennie Director Devon Trolley


Gehman said he started his company in 2019, paying “basically nothing” at first for Pennie. Last year, his business made $75,000, which doesn’t include expenses. 
While he has found a way to balance his checkbook, others aren’t so fortunate. Some have reported paying nearly $1,800 a month for their Pennie coverage. 
“You should be able to work full time and afford health insurance,” Gehman said. “… It’s so high now for a lot of people and they have to choose between, ‘Well, do I want to make my mortgage payment or my health insurance?’ Obviously, they’re going to get rid of health insurance.”
 Falling Pennie enrollment

In 2025, 497,000 Pennsylvanians were enrolled in Pennie — a record-breaking amount. During the enrollment period from Nov. 1, 2024 and Jan. 15, 2025, 90,000 people signed up.
But, more than halfway through this cycle’s enrollment period, overall enrollment numbers are down by 20,000 people and nearly 1,000 terminate their coverage each day, according to Pennie Director Devon Trolley. As of this week, between 465,000 and 472,000 Pennsylvanians are enrolled in Pennie.  The open enrollment period for this year was extended to Feb. 1.
“We don’t have a lot of insight into where people ended up,” Trolley said. “Anecdotally, from our call center … we’ve been hearing pretty consistently that cost has been a major factor this year.”

The most significant premium increases hit those over the age of 55, Trolley said, especially those earning above the enhanced subsidy cutoff — roughly $62,600 for a single person or $84,600 for a family of two. 
“Take a 60-year-old couple, for example. In 2025, they were paying about $500 or $600 a month and now, in 2026, their bill is $2,000 to $3,000 a month,” said Trolley. “In some cases, we’re seeing the monthly premiums for that population comprise upwards of 50% of their income.”
Preventative care for this age group can be critical to identifying chronic conditions and is a core part of the services covered by the Affordable Care Act, as detailed by health policy group KFF.
“Without health coverage, you’re not catching those early, you’re not managing chronic conditions,” said Trolley. “And by the time they do hit Medicare at age 65, the population is going to be sicker and more costly (to cover).”
To 61-year-old Scott Cannon, of Luzerne County, insurance is “a necessity” at his age.
“I can’t not have it, but I know some people younger than me who are gambling and not having it,” said Cannon. “I’m worried for them because if something were to happen, it’d be a tough situation.”

Cannon is a videographer whose wife works part time at the local library. Together, their monthly bill used to be $83 — which was “very affordable” — and now costs $283. 
“It’s tough because the price of everything is going up … I do a lot of videos, television commercials and social media videos for businesses and AI is being used by those businesses instead,” said Cannon. “So business is getting harder and harder to find.” 
After 30 years of using the same landline for his business, Cannon opted to cancel that contract to make up the cost difference. 
While renewing the policy for him and his wife was fairly straightforward, getting coverage for their youngest daughter has been a challenge. 
After turning 19 in November, she no longer qualifies for the Children’s Health Insurance Program, but might get her own policy through Medicaid. However, a paperwork mixup seems to have closed that pathway, so the Cannons are looking at adding her to the family plan.
“We’re already paying more than we did last year, so now we’re going to add my daughter’s insurance on top of that,” said Cannon. “In the meantime, I don’t think my daughter’s covered.”
 Over in Congress

Though the credits are designed to make coverage more affordable, it comes with a $1 trillion price tag for the federal government, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Extending the subsidies for those making about the threshold makes up roughly $35 billion of that estimate. 
The enhanced benefit is a recent development — part of a 2021 COVID-19 relief package that passed under former President Joe Biden and expired at the end of 2025. Extending the subsidies is popular across the country, according to KFF polling, but Republicans point to mounting costs for taxpayers. 
US House backs extension of health insurance subsidies after Dems force vote

In the House, votes fell largely along partisan lines, though three swing district Pennsylvanian representatives joined Democrats to advance the bill: Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick (1st District), Ryan Mackenzie (7th District) and Rob Bresnahan (8th District).
The commonwealth’s seven other Republican lawmakers voted against the measure. 
The U.S. Senate has been working on its own health care package over the interim, and may not take up the House’s effort. 
Not knowing where Congress will land complicates Pennie’s work, Trolley said. A “straight extension” would be the quickest to implement, she added, but “any changes beyond that would take more time to understand.”
“If congressional action does occur, we would make sure to provide some opportunity for people to come back in and change their mind,” said Trolley. “What that looks like really depends on when exactly an extension would occur and what that extension looks like.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_8191-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-08 19:00:01.891722

Jared Polis.
Lawmakers, workers and union members crammed into the space outside the governor’s office in the state Capitol on Thursday to announce the return of the so-called Worker Protection Act. The legislative session begins next week.
“We’re back here because the problem did not go away,” Rep. Javier Mabrey, a Denver Democrat who will once again run the bill, said. “You hear politician after politician saying ‘Affordability, affordability, affordability.’ Well, we are here with an actual, real solution to increase worker power and to increase wages.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Alongside Mabrey, the bill will be backed by Rep. Jennifer Bacon, a Denver Democrat and Sen. Jessie Danielson, a Wheat Ridge Democrat.
The bill, like last year’s version, would get rid of a second union election rule, unique to Colorado, to form what’s known as a strong union. After a majority of workers vote to form a union, as outlined in federal law, there is a second election with a 75% threshold for workers to negotiate which employees need to pay dues. The second election does not compel union membership, but it opens the door to discuss whether all employees should pay into the union representation they benefit from.
“That second election just gives employers more time to intimidate workers and shut down organizing efforts before workers ever get a real seat at the table,” Danielson said.










Service workers are the backbone of our communities, but too many of us can't afford to even live where we work. We should not be punished and our vote should not be delayed.


– Josh Reitze, a cook at the Alamo Drafthouse movie theater


Colorado is the only state to have a second election requirement, and workers say it can be an arduous process. Josh Reitze, a cook at the Alamo Drafthouse movie theater in Denver’s Sloan’s Lake neighborhood, said his union voted to form in 2024 and began negotiations in September of that year. Members are just now waiting for the results of that second election, 15 months since the union was created.
“Service workers are the backbone of our communities, but too many of us can’t afford to even live where we work. We should not be punished and our vote should not be delayed,” Reitze said. “The Worker Protection Act matters because it would stop companies from dragging out the process and using fear to silence its workers.”
Business groups generally support the second election requirement, which has been Colorado law since the 1940s.
Last year, the Worker Protection Act languished in the Legislature as business groups, legislators and unions tried to reach a compromise at the behest of Polis, who said he would not sign a bill that both sides didn’t agree to. Negotiations collapsed, and the bill passed unchanged with every Democrat in support. Polis, also a Democrat, then vetoed it. His office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the bill’s resurgence.
Mabrey told reporters on Thursday that Polis had “not explicitly” said he would veto this year’s bill, but there has not been discussion with the business community in the legislative interim.
“We do not need a task force to figure this out,” Mabrey said. “We need a governor who has the courage to stand with workers.”
This will be the final regular legislative session with Polis as governor. Sen. Michael Bennet and Attorney General Phil Weiser are the Democrats running to replace him, though neither have said whether they support the legislation.
“Maybe if we fail this year, we can get it done next year,” Mabrey said.
The 120-day legislative session begins on Jan. 14. Democrats hold wide majorities in both chambers.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)Overcrowded buses. Longer waits. And missed weekend trips.
This is the new reality most bus riders have faced since the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA) enacted the most significant service reductions in its 59-year history last September, according to a report released Thursday by a coalition of public transit advocates.
The 14-page report looks at the impact of those cuts on both riders and bus operators as the cash-strapped agency closed a multimillion dollar funding gap that originated with Gov. Dan McKee’s fiscal 2026 budget. When the 2025 legislative session ended last June, RIPTA was still $18 million in the red.
A week before McKee is expected to drop his proposed fiscal 2027 budget, Save RIPTA coalition members joined lawmakers in the State House library to go over their new findings and present a laundry list of bills they want introduced in the 2026 General Assembly to get more Rhode Islanders on the bus.
The report found that 75% of RIPTA’s routes lost ridership since September when the cuts took effect.
“We told y’all what would happen,” Liza Burkin, an organizer with Save RIPTA, told the crowd. 
Save RIPTA’s report notes the agency started the second half of 2024 with the appointment of a permanent CEO while being kept afloat by the last of the state’s pandemic aid granted by the federal government.
“Things were looking up — temporarily,” the report states.
But 2025 did not see the same relief given to RIPTA, resulting in reductions on 46 of its 67 bus lines — the most significant cuts in the agency’s 59-year history. That’s because McKee initially declined to fill a $32.6 million deficit for the agency as he and other state leaders awaited an overdue efficiency study to find ways to cut costs and “right size” operations.
The General Assembly eventually propped up RIPTA with nearly $15 million in annual revenue. RIPTA administrators working with McKee’s office found other savings, but it still was not enough to avoid the service reductions.
The report found RIPTA has been less efficient as an agency since the cuts were made last fall. 
In fiscal year 2025, RIPTA spent $183 per service hour on operations. Now it costs the agency over $236 per service hour — a 29% increase.
At the same time, the report found 21 of RIPTA’s routes operate at least once an hour every day — a statistic referred to as a “lowest minimum frequency standard.” Before service cuts were enacted, the coalition’s report found 33 bus lines operated on at least an hourly basis.
“And we wonder why we can’t grow ridership,” Burkin said. “Frequency is the core — you need to go to the bus stop and know another one will come.”
Chrys Santos, a sophomore at the Blackstone Academy Charter School in Pawtucket, told the crowd she was recently an hour-and-a-half late for class after watching two full buses skip by her stop.
“I missed two of my morning classes and my grades in algebra and Spanish went down by five points,” Santos said.
RIPTA’s cuts haven’t been easy on drivers either. Jorge Alves, who has worked as a bus driver for the last 13 years, said he’s had little break time after trips. He said passengers are becoming more agitated as the less frequent buses start to get more crammed.
“It’s become very stressful to work,” Alves said. “The pressure’s always on you to go faster and get more done in the same amount of time.”

Happy new year with a $14 million deficit
RIPTA’s board of directors in December approved a fiscal 2027 budget request that has a nearly $14 million deficit to send to McKee’s office — with hopes it would be filled by the governor and lawmakers.
Olivia DaRocha, a spokesperson for McKee’s office, said the governor intends to plug RIPTA’s gap in his budget recommendation set to be unveiled next week. She did not state how he would like to see the state plug the agency’s deficit.
But even that funding commitment is still not enough to restore service to what it was before last fall.
RIPTA once again counts on Gov. McKee to fill its budget gap

“The $13.8 million is required to run service as it currently exists today,” Sara Furbush, a RIPTA spokesperson, said in an email to Rhode Island Current.
To regain lost service, advocates say the state would need to allocate an additional $5 million — something advocates hope the state will provide to RIPTA through a supplemental budget allocation.
Sen. Mark McKenney, a Warwick Democrat, and Rep. Karen Alzate, a Pawtucket Democrat, attended the event in the State House library. They intend to sponsor the legislation that will allocate the additional funding.
“Properly funding RIPTA isn’t a drain on our budgets,” Alzate said. “It is an investment in prosperity in an equitable and sustainable Rhode Island.”
Advocates want to see bus service grow, which is why their biggest priority is to get RIPTA an additional $10 million in annual revenue by upping the agency’s share of the state’s Highway Maintenance Account to 20%.
In the state’s most recent budget, lawmakers had granted RIPTA 15% of the account funded by vehicle registration fees.
Legislation to up RIPTA’s share will be sponsored in the House by Rep. Terri Cortvriend, a Portsmouth Democrat. A Senate sponsor has not yet been identified, Burkin told reporters.
“We need to pass these bills to stabilize finances and start to grow and expand RIPTA, not just save it,” Burkin said. “And that starts today.”



6 ways to better bus service in Rhode Island
Advocates outlined a half dozen additional policy priorities to enhance bus service in Rhode Island. They include bills that Save RIPTA hopes will be introduced in the General Assembly soon, organizer Liza Burkin said.

Shift the state’s existing 7% sales tax on rideshare trips toward RIPTA’s paratransit programs. Save RIPTA’s report projects $10 million to $15 million in annual revenue from the tax. Legislation would be sponsored in the Senate by Robert Britto, an East Providence Democrat, and in the House by Jennifer Stewart, a Pawtucket Democrat.
Require companies with 500 or more employees to provide transit passes via RIPTA Wave to Work program. Revenue has not yet been calculated. Legislation would be sponsored in the Senate by Jake Bissailion, a Providence Democrat, and in the House by Deputy Speaker Raymond Hull, a Providence Democrat.
Put a $100 million bond referendum on this year’s ballot. RIPTA would use proceeds toward capital projects such as new bus shelters, creating dedicated bus lanes, and updating fare technology. Legislation will be sponsored in the Senate by Lamis Vargas, a Cranston Democrat, and in the House by Rep. Teresa Tanzi, a South Kingstown Democrat.
Raise car inspection fees. Proceeds would go into the Highway Maintenance Account. Legislation would be sponsored in the Senate by Vargas. A primary House sponsor has not been identified.
Restructure RIPTA’s board of directors. The coalition wants to see Rhode Island Department of Transportation Director Peter Alviti Jr. ousted as RIPTA’s board chairman. Lawmakers in 2023 adopted a plan to reorganize the board with the state’s transportation chief heading the board to broaden oversight of the bus agency. Legislation to undo that shakeup would be sponsored in the Senate by Tiara Mack, a Providence Democrat, and in the House by Tanzi.
Adjust the gas tax to account for inflation every two years. Projections only consider inflation from the previous year. Legislation would be sponsored in the Senate by Sam Zurier, a Providence Democrat, and in the House by Stewart.

At left is PSC chair Randy Christmann. (Photo by Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)Two power companies are asking the North Dakota Public Service Commission to make a determination that some local zoning ordinances along a proposed powerline are overly restrictive, which would trigger a new law that says state zoning rules trump local ordinances for transmission lines. 
An attorney representing Otter Tail Power and Montana-Dakota Utilities announced the request Thursday at the start of a hearing on the Jamestown to Ellendale high-voltage powerline project, also known as JETx.
Jason Weiers, manager of transmission policy and contracts for Otter Tail Power, testified that overly restrictive ordinances in townships along the proposed route threaten to make the project unfeasible. 
Otter Tail Power and Montana-Dakota Utilities would jointly construct, own and operate the 92-mile powerline. The companies asked the three-person PSC to find the setback ordinances of some townships overly restrictive, making the state’s 500-foot setback from occupied residences the standard. 
Weiers said Homer and Corwin townships in Stutsman County and Willowbank Township in LaMoure County have passed ordinances requiring that high-voltage powerlines be 2,640 feet, or half a mile, away from an occupied residence. 
Weiers said in Homer Township the setback is essentially a “ban on the development of high-voltage power lines.” In Corwin and Willowbank, the setback makes routing the powerline  “nearly impossible.” 
Three townships in LaMoure County — Russell, Wano and Willowbank — also have passed moratoriums on high-voltage power lines. Weiers said the moratoriums “appear to target the project directly.”
North Dakota using new split hearing option on controversial power line

The Legislature passed a bill in 2025 specifying that state zoning rules can supersede local ordinances. The law took effect Aug. 1. The JETx project was referenced in testimony about the bill. 
The companies say the project is needed to improve grid reliability in the Jamestown area, which has been hit by both winter and summer storms in recent years, forcing power use to be curtailed. 
Rob Frank, director of electric transmission engineering for MDU, said the line connecting to two other high-voltage lines offers “significant reliability benefits” and also would improve transmission into South Dakota. 
The companies hope to start construction later this year with completion in 2028. 
Weiers said the project is estimated to cost $406 million. He said routing around townships with restrictive ordinances could add $24 million to the cost. 
The project would use 502 single pole supports that would be 120 feet to 180 feet tall. 
The PSC set aside two days for a technical hearing on the project, with Otter Tail and MDU officials providing detailed information. 
Next week, the PSC will hold hearings in Ellendale, Edgeley and Jamestown to gather public input. It is the first time the PSC has used a newly established process for holding separate technical and public hearings. 
Weiers said 134 of 173 landowners — 77% — along the route have signed agreements to allow the powerline to run through their property. He said that equates to 76% of the length of the 92 mile line.  
The Public Service Commission previously approved a certificate of need for the project but still needs to approve a route permit.

Commission Chairman Randy Christmann voted against the project last year and Thursday asked more questions. 
“Is it about hooking up to renewables or is it about reliability?” he asked Weiers, referring to wind power in the area. 
Weiers said that the project benefits improved transmission from wind turbines west of Ellendale and grid reliability. 
Christmann asked Frank why easement signings seemed to be low and resistance from townships is unusually high. 
Frank cited “landowner fatigue” to new projects of all kinds but said easement signings were typical for a powerline project. 
“Some landowners are unwilling to sign over property rights for anything,” he said.

Andy Ogles of Tennessee's 5th Congressional District responded by calling for Nashville's mayor to be arrested. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)On Tuesday, after 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good was shot in Minneapolis at close range by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer, U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles of Tennessee’s 5th District didn’t wait too long to weigh in with his opinions. 
If you’ve been following Ogles, who was first elected to Congress in 2022, you won’t be surprised to hear he didn’t offer sympathy. 
No, he posted first on social media that Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell should be arrested. 
“Minneapolis Mayor (Jacob) Frey and Nashville Mayor O’Connell are cut from the same cloth. It’s deeper than rhetoric, its (sic) political decisions intended to betray ICE and Federal partners. ICE agents are in danger because of them. Illegal aliens are NOT our friends. They should be arrested immediately,” wrote Ogles on X and Facebook. 
The reference to Mayor Frey came after he said, in a press conference following the shooting, that ICE needs to “get the f- – – out of Minneapolis.” 
Four hours later, he posted, “Send the (National) Guard to Nashville!” and said that the shooting of Good was justified. 
There’s a lot to unpack here but what stands out — beyond the obviously heinous and inhumane support for the killing of an innocent woman by federal agents — is a sitting congressman’s apparent willingness to call out the military in his own district, for what appears to be no reason other than to mess with the mayor of the largest city in that district. 
Besides the fact that O’Connell has done nothing more than say about May ICE raids in Nashville that “these people don’t share our values,” Ogles’ call for arresting him shines a dangerous spotlight on O’Connell in a period in which political violence is a clear and present danger. 

Pray for our ICE patriots. Democrats continue to demonize the men and women doing everything in their power to make our country safe.
If you put an ICE agent in mortal danger, self-defense is JUSTIFIED. https://t.co/iIALKYhzFz
— Rep. Andy Ogles (@RepOgles) January 7, 2026

Less than a year ago, a man dressed as a police officer murdered Minnesota lawmaker Melissa Hortman and her husband after shooting a state senator and his wife. 
Surely, I thought to myself — surely — some members of our federal delegation will respond to the shooting in a more dignified and compassionate way. 
U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen of the Memphis-based 9th Congressional District and the only Democrat in the delegation, issued a statement.
“Today’s incident is just what I feared: out-of-control, masked ICE agents fatally misusing their authority and inflaming our communities. Today, it happened in Minneapolis, but it could be Memphis, which also has an outsized and aggressive ICE presence,” the statement read. 
I decided to check the social media feeds of the other members of Tennessee’s federal delegation, including U.S. Sens. Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty, and found little. 
U.S. Rep. Tim Burchett of Knoxville’s 2nd Congressional District, used the somber day to call for investigation into the immigration records of his Democratic colleague, U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Minnesota congresswoman who was born in Somalia but emigrated to the U.S. with her family when she was 13. 
To initiate such proceedings at all, but especially on the day an American citizen was gunned down in the district Omar represents, is beyond petty: It’s callous, repugnant and hateful.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security initially deployed thousands of ICE agents to Minneapolis as part of a Trump administration operation targeting Somalian immigrants, all because an article claimed — with little evidence to support it — that Somalian residents are defrauding public programs in the state and using the money gained to fund terrorist organizations. 
It may be a new low for Burchett, but at least we know where he stands. 
Finding nothing on Wednesday’s social media feeds of Tennessee’s other six U.S. representatives and two senators reflecting on the Minnesota tragedy, I emailed their press secretaries. 
I heard back from only 6th District Rep. John Rose, a candidate for the Republican gubernatorial nomination. 
In a statement, Rose said, “What happened in Minneapolis is tragic. No one wants to see a young woman lose her life or children lose their mother. It’s awful.
“But, we must acknowledge the facts. Multiple law enforcement officials were attempting to communicate with Ms. Good who, rather than responding in a reasonable manner, steered her car and accelerated toward a federal law enforcement official,” read the statement.  Life-saving action was taken to prevent the death of that officer.”
I give him credit for responding, although the videos viewed by my colleagues at the Minnesota Reformer do not support this version of events;  from the other members of the delegation, I received nothing: not a “no comment,” much less a tepid “thoughts and prayers” comment of the type our elected officials usually offer. 
Again, I checked their social media accounts on Thursday. 
Blackburn, also running in the Republican gubernatorial primary, called for the denaturalization of anyone “who comes to the United States to steal from the American people” by committing fraud. 
A few months ago, Charlie Kirk, a right wing podcaster, was shot and killed by a private citizen at a speaking event and these same representatives didn’t hesitate to post that they were “devastated” by his murder — which is fine and appropriate. Kirk’s murder was horrendous and lawmakers of both major political persuasions should have, and did, speak out against it and political violence in general. 
Yet, most of the same Tennessee lawmakers that expressed sadness and rage over one killing, expressed not an ounce of empathy for Good’s family or offered solace to their own constituents feeling fear, hurt and sadness.
Know that most, if not all, of these representatives will be reelected in November, and unless electoral trends experience a cataclysmic reversal in the next eight months, Rose or Blackburn will be Tennessee’s next governor.
It’s important to assess their reactions to the killing of a citizen by government agents, because while I hope this is the last such incident, I am fearful it will not be.

(Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)A legislative task force on hazing on Louisiana’s college campuses is recommending increased required training for all students — not just those in Greek organizations — and greater penalties for universities that shirk their obligations. 
The task force, named in honor of Southern University student Caleb Wilson, who died in a hazing incident last year, is composed of legislators, public higher education officials and college students. Five people have been indicted in connection with Wilson’s February death during a pledge initiation for the Omega Psi Phi fraternity. The chapter has been removed from Southern’s campus though it has the option to appeal and return.
Members of the task force, created last year by Southern alumnus Rep. Jason Hughes, D-New Orleans, met for the final time Thursday. They voted to recommend legislation that would require annual anti-hazing training for public college and university students and advisers to student organizations, who are typically school faculty or staff members. The legislative panel also emphasized the need to require the training for “external advisers” who are not university employees such as those who work with Greek organizations. 
The task force considered a proposal to require training for all faculty and staff, but LSU Vice President and General Counsel Trey Jones, a task force member, raised concerns that a mandate for thousands of employees was overbroad. The task force settled on expanding the requirement to more faculty and staff members, though the legislature will have to determine which employees will be required to take part in the training. 
The group also recommended adopting amnesty policies that would allow students to report hazing without fear of repercussions for violating other university policies. 
The panel also agreed it was key to roll back a 2024 law, Act 416 by Rep. Dixon McMakin, R-Baton Rouge, that dramatically increased the standard of evidence required to prove a hazing charge in campus disciplinary proceedings from “preponderance of evidence” to “clear and convincing.” 
Under the old standard, administrators could hold a student responsible if the evidence points to it being at least slightly more likely than not the student is responsible. Even if there is conflicting testimony, a student whistleblower could be punished if the evidence tipped the scale just past a 50% likelihood. 
Now universities need clear and convincing evidence, a standard used in some court cases such as proving fraud or terminating parental rights. The threshold requires evidence that points to the student’s guilt being substantially more probable than not, and it might require multiple witnesses, photos or other reports to firmly convince administrators.
Clearing that bar can be difficult because, unlike in courtroom proceedings, administrators don’t have as much power to gather evidence. 
University officials on the panel said the new standard of evidence makes it nearly impossible to hold students accountable for hazing and could eventually lead to schools not attempting to discipline students for offenses because it could open them up to legal liability. 
The task force also recommended universities include a section on hazing in the annual power-based violence reports they make to the legislature, and that the information is also posted to universities’ websites. Under current law, schools that fail to submit the reports are prohibited from going before the state Bond Commission for two years, effectively limiting them from any of major infrastructure or building projects during that period. The same penalty was  recommended for failure to submit a hazing report. 
The group also highlighted the need to identify dedicated dollars to support hazing prevention, training and reporting. 
Their priorities are likely to be addressed in the upcoming legislative session, which begins March 9. Rep. Vanessa LaFleur, D-Baton Rouge, said lawmakers will meet soon to decide who will sponsor the bills. 
Sen. Gerald Boudreaux, D-Lafayette, said he would also sponsor legislation to clarify the difference between suspending and expelling a student organization.

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)An investigation of unlawful computer use and computer-generated pornography sharing by a former employee of the state Division of Motor Vehicles has turned up at least 50 victims, South Dakota Attorney General Marty Jackley announced Thursday.
Mark Rathbun, 68, of Aberdeen, was initially indicted in November for solicitation of rape, possession of child pornography and unauthorized use of computer systems. Those charges related to two victims, one of whom he’d been involved in a “domestic relationship” with, according to court documents.
At the time, Jackley said investigators following up on a tip about child pornography found driver’s license images on some of the 30 electronic devices in Rathbun’s home. Jackley’s office declined to outline any connections there may be between the victims of driver’s license data theft and computer-generated pornography, citing the ongoing investigation.
The investigation was likely to turn up more victims, Jackley said at a November press conference.
Attorney general charges former state employee with computer misuse, child porn, rape solicitation

This week, Rathbun was named in an 85-count indictment that references 50 victims. One of the indictment’s 26 counts of child porn possession relates to a video of an unnamed minor engaged in a sex act; the other 25 are tied to “computer-generated” pornographic images of real children, identified by initials. Some of the children’s initials are tied to multiple images.
Eighteen counts involve the alleged dissemination or sale of computer-generated pornography, again involving imagery of real people identified by initials, some of whom were younger than 17. 
The remaining 40 charges are for unlawful use of computer systems. The indictment lists 10 counts for accessing “confidential driver’s license data or material pertaining to” victims without specifying exactly what information may have been taken. The rest relate to Rathbun’s alleged copying or obtaining of driver’s license image files.
Based on the initials listed in the indictment, two of the alleged victims of driver’s license data theft were also depicted in computer-generated pornography. One victim whose photo was allegedly lifted from the driver’s license system was depicted in 10 separate computer-generated images.
“We continue to review images found on his electronic devices and will reach out to potential victims for notification,” Jackley said in his Thursday news release.
If convicted on all counts, Rathbun faces up to 395 years in prison.
Rathbun is one of numerous former state employees charged with crimes over the past two years. One former Department of Social Services employee named Lonna Carroll was sentenced to seven years in prison for the theft of $1.8 million from the state across multiple years. Other former state employees have been accused or found guilty of forging food service inspections, falsifying child abuse reports, creating false vehicle titles and issuing themselves a medical marijuana card.

(Photo by Jacob Orledge/North Dakota Monitor)The North Dakota Legislature is taking steps to improve security for its members, including removing requirements in state law for home addresses to be publicly disclosed and initiating security training for all lawmakers. 
Lawmakers on Thursday directed legislative staff to prepare a memo describing how both initiatives can be accomplished following a confidential security briefing from the North Dakota Highway Patrol. 
“We live in a different world than we lived in 10 years ago,” said Sen. Kathy Hogan, D-Fargo, during a discussion following the confidential briefing. 
The briefing, which presented a threat assessment of the Capitol complex and guidance to legislators who receive threats, prompted both concerns and shrugs from some lawmakers. 
North Dakota lawmakers to hold hearing on security concerns after Minnesota attacks

Reps. Robin Weisz, R-Hurdsfield, and Anna Novak, R-Hazen, live in rural communities. They said there is a limit to the security precautions they can take when most of their community can recognize their vehicles or homes on sight. 
“The reality is, especially for those of us in rural areas, everybody knows where we live,” Weisz said. “It’s not like you can have any security sitting out on your farmstead.”
At the same time, they said they appreciated the briefing from law enforcement, which was prompted in part by the shootings of two Minnesota lawmakers last June. Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman, and her husband Mark, were killed in their Brooklyn Park home.
“She was attacked in her home,” Novak said. “That’s the scary part. But I live in a small town, very much pro Second Amendment, and so I feel pretty safe because of that.”
Minnesota Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, were also wounded in a shooting at their home, and investigators found a list of other Democratic lawmakers in the vehicle of Vance Boelter, who has been charged with the crimes.
The Highway Patrol did not make any policy recommendations during the confidential session, but the information prompted two proposals from lawmakers. 
In addition to the security training sessions for all legislators and staff at the start of every legislative session, there was also a lot of concern that state law requires lawmakers to include their home addresses on several filings that executive branch agencies are in turn required to make available to the public. 
“They are required to disclose our home address,” said. Rep. Kristin Roers, R-Fargo. “We need to think about where else in code, where else on the web, are we disclosing addresses?”
The committee directed Legislative Council to prepare a list of places in state law that need to be amended in order to change that. John Bjornson, director of Legislative Council, encouraged legislators to begin using post office boxes when they have to provide contact information.

The Capitol threat assessment identifies potential vulnerabilities in the building and will not be disclosed to the public. Weisz said the Highway Patrol may ask for additional funding for security during the next regular legislative session but no specifics of the threat assessment were provided. North Dakota installed metal detectors at the public entrance of the Capitol in 2017, a response to Dakota Access Pipeline protests, which also included some demonstrations in Bismarck. The security measure was made permanent after that legislative session. 
While there has not been a notable long-term increase in threats reported by lawmakers to the Highway Patrol, North Dakota is not insulated against potential threats crossing state lines, Lt. Jenna Clawson Huibregtse said. 
“North Dakota isn’t immune from people coming from other states as well,” Clawson Huibregtse said. “Threats that come in to political officials aren’t necessarily always people that are from North Dakota.”
Weisz is one of the lawmakers who has received multiple threats against himself and his family over time. It’s not pleasant, but there isn’t much he can do but take common sense precautions, Weisz said. 
“I’m not gonna live my life in fear,” he said. 
Security costs
Personal security, especially while at home, has been a prominent concern among lawmakers since the Minnesota attacks. Legislative Council removed legislators’ home addresses from the website shortly afterwards. 
Yet while the Highway Patrol provides security at the Capitol complex and can provide assistance at official events elsewhere in the state, there are few options for legislators who desire more protection in their districts or at their homes. The Highway Patrol, authorized to employ 171 officers, does not have the staffing to provide regular assistance to all 141 state lawmakers. 
State lawmakers reconsider costs, purpose of serving after Minnesota assassination

The North Dakota Ethics Commission, a few weeks after the shooting in the neighboring state, issued an advisory opinion interpreting state law as allowing campaign funds to be used on security expenditures in certain situations. Attorney General Drew Wrigley overruled that in a legal opinion of his own late last year, declaring the advisory opinion void. 
Some states like Minnesota offer stipends to lawmakers for security costs. North Dakota is not one of them. But the National Conference of State Legislatures is planning to launch a new $1.5 million Security Fund next month that may fill some of the gap. 
Bryan Thomas, chief communications officer, said every state legislature will receive funding based on its membership count. The legislatures will have the flexibility to spend the dollars as they see fit, whether on group training sessions or stipends to individuals for small purchases like doorbell cameras, as long as it is broadly available and not limited to a select few lawmakers. 
“There’ll be really flexible dollars that legislatures will have access to, to support their members to help a little bit in their security for themselves and their families,” Thomas said. 
He said there is sufficient funding to provide an average of $200 per legislator across the country. That’s far less than stipends offered by some states, such as Minnesota, which provides a stipend up to $4,500 for home security. But if the program is successful and the organization can identify additional funding, it could continue in future years. 
“$200 doesn’t go a long way, but it certainly helps,” Thomas said.

“Her commitment to public service and her ability to navigate complex policy issues make her uniquely qualified to help navigate important decisions and support increased transparency and accountability for key public investment approved by the Board of Public Works. I am thrilled to welcome her to Team Comptroller,” Lierman’s statement said.
Jones stepped down from the rostrum in December. Lambert, along with Jones’ Chief of Staff Matt Jackson and Communications Director Marty McGowan, were replaced as new House Speaker Joseline Peña Melnyk moved staff from her legislative and committee offices into those senior positions.
Earlier this week, Senate President Bill Ferguson announced Jackson has joined his office.
Also on Wednesday, Lierman announced Thomas Brennan III, a five-year veteran of the office, was promoted to serve as her liaison to the Board of Public Works — a deputy to Lambert.
“It is a pleasure to have Thomas Brennan as our Board of Public Works Liaison. He is an invaluable member of our team whose diligence, expertise, and commitment are invaluable to our approach to board business,” Lierman said in her statement. “I look forward to seeing Thomas grow into his new role and the strong partnership he and Director Lambert will form in the coming year.”

Jan. 8, 2026. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Calling affordable child care vital to Nebraska’s workforce, business leaders joined other advocates Thursday in championing a proposed state law to extend current income eligibility levels for a child care subsidy.
Hunter Traynor, executive vice president of the Nebraska Chamber of Commerce & Industry was among dozens gathered at the State Capitol in support of Legislative Bill 304, which would make permanent the income eligibility caps enacted into law in 2021.

Now set to expire in October, income eligibility for the state child care subsidy program was raised from 130% to 185% of the federal poverty level. For a family of four, that meant household earnings could be $59,000 instead of $42,000.
State Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Omaha, who was part of a bipartisan group of about 20 lawmakers supporting the bill, said she has named LB 304 her priority legislation for the 2026 session.
The bill stalled last year in a committee, as state officials estimated the annual financial impact at about $14 million in general funds. The state’s latest shortfall is estimated at $471 million. DeBoer said Thursday she was working with the Department of Health and Human Services to find the additional funding to support the bill.
“While there is a cost to this child care assistance, the cost to the state of doing nothing is much larger,” she said. “So we will find a fiscal solution.”
Said Traynor: “Passing this legislation would help nearly 3,000 families remain eligible for child care assistance and help employers remain fully staffed in an extremely tight labor market.”
Child care providers and advocacy agencies said that was a conservative number.

Traynor pointed to a recent report estimating the annual state impact of inadequate child care at $1.7 billion in lost business output and $1.6 billion in lost labor income, including both direct and multiplier effects. He said that leads to a loss of nearly $64 million in state income tax revenue and 6,843 jobs. 
The report was prepared for the Nebraska Chamber Foundation in partnership with First Five Nebraska and the Bureau of Business Research at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. It says that the median annual cost for child care services ranges between $9,000 and $15,000 per child for center-based care.
DeBoer said the state was at a “crisis point” in 2021 when it changed the child care subsidy eligibility levels to help parents remain in the workplace. She said assistance came in other ways as well, including streamlining the process for background checks of child care workers.
“The work isn’t done,” she said.
If the bill does not pass, child care representatives said Nebraska would fall to No. 48 in the nation for access to child care subsidies based on income eligibility. Currently, Nebraska ranks at 38, said First Five Nebraska, a child care advocacy agency. 
Nebraska’s child care assistance program is funded by a mix of federal and state funds for a total of about $110 million a year, First Five said. 
Former Nebraska football player Derek Branch also spoke, urging former Husker defensive back Gov. Jim Pillen to stand by “working families and their children” by supporting the bill.
“Now is not the time to drop the ball,” Branch said.

 ‘My lifeline’

Haley Overman, a widowed mom of three children, said she would be among the families that would lose a child care subsidy if the eligibility income levels were to return to previous levels in October.
“It’s basically my lifeline,” she said, noting that she lost a second income when her husband died. 
Overman, who works in the medical billing industry, said she has a house and car payment and is uncertain of how her family life would change further if she lost the child care subsidy. She said she might have to sell their home. 
State Sen. Bob Hallstrom of Syracuse, also among the speakers, also turned to Nebraska’s workforce concerns in voicing support for the bill. 
“This is a practical, Nebraska-focused investment, one that supports work, strengthens families and keeps businesses competitive in both rural and urban communities,” he said.

Melanie Stansbury celebrated the U.S. House of Representatives’ passage of a measure to renew health insurance subsidies Thursday.,"U.S. Rep. Melanie Stansbury (D-N.M.) addresses attendees at an Oct. 20, 2025 Rio Rancho town hall. Stansbury called the Jan. 8, 2026 passage of a proposal to renew and extend health insurance subsidies ‘a huge deal.’ (Danielle Prokop/Source NM)U.S. Rep. Melanie Stansbury (D-New Mexico) on Thursday called the U.S. House of Representatives’ passage of a measure to renew health insurance subsidies that expired at the end of 2025 “a huge deal,” in a call with news media.
“These subsidies help to massively expand the number of uninsured individuals to actually have access to health care,” said Stansbury, who represents the state’s 1st Congressional District. The bill advanced on a 230-196 vote, with 17 Republicans joining House Democrats to send it to the Senate.
The expiration of subsidies created by Congress in 2021 for the Affordable Care Act was the main factor in prompting the longest ever federal government shutdown late last year.
Republicans wouldn’t agree to extend subsidies for the cost of health care insurance in state marketplaces, so millions of Americans as of January face increases for the costs of copays, deductibles, and premiums.
Just before the holiday recess, four Republican members joined House Democrats in forcing the vote, defying Republican leadership. On Wednesday — in a new session of Congress — nine Republicans joined Democrats on the procedural action to take up the issue.
Stansbury said the current version of the bill, which extends tax subsidies for the next three years, will likely see changes in the Senate, where similar measures failed to advance in December.
“But it does create a new political pathway and pressure in the Senate and with the White House, especially with Republican support, to get some sort of extension, hopefully, in the coming weeks,” Stansbury said.

While the sticker shock is driving declines for enrollment in other states, New Mexico earlier this week reported a third enrollment increase.
Prior to the subsidies’ expiration, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and state lawmakers in a special legislative session in October, approved $17.3 million to offset the costs of tax credits, covering the portion the federal government paid for 6,000 New Mexicans whose income is more than 400% of the federal poverty level.
Stansbury on Thursday praised the state government’s “very proactive” actions during the special session, but said Congressional action for the extension would be needed to ensure the approximately 27,000 New Mexicans currently requiring state assistance can access health insurance coverage.
In her budget request for the 2027 fiscal year, Lujan Grisham proposed the Legislature allot more than $81 million during the upcoming 2026 Legislative session to “to keep health insurance affordable for New Mexicans.” The Legislative Finance Committee’s version of the budget proposal recommends earmarking $126.6 million to the state’s Health Care Affordability Fund to lower the costs for health care.
In addition to the health care subsidies, Stansbury expressed condolences during the call with news outlets for the family of 37-year-old Renee Good, who was killed Wednesday by a federal immigration agent in Minneapolis.

“Many across the United States, including in New Mexico, are feeling afraid,” Stansbury said. “We’re receiving literally hundreds of calls from New Mexicans right now, who are scared about what might happen next, what the administration might do next, whether or not they’re going to come and invade our community.”
She said she and U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly (D-Illinois) will bring articles of impeachment against U.S. Department of Homeland Secretary Kristi Noem, saying the department has “has abused its authority, as committed acts of violence,” and also cited the reports of Noem’s alleged self-dealing in violation of ethics rules.
She told members of the news media that she was not necessarily concerned about an increased presence of immigration authorities in New Mexico. “The risk is there, but we are doing all of the things that we can as both the members of Congress, state officials and local officials to make sure the New Mexicans are safe and that the legal rights of New Mexicans are protected,” she said.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa House Democrats said Thursday they plan to propose a constitutional amendment during the upcoming legislative session to prevent future changes to the Iowa Public Employees’ Retirement System.
Concerns about potential changes arose during discussions by a task force appointed by Gov. Kim Reynolds aimed at saving taxpayer dollars.
Rep. Sean Bagniewski, House minority whip, and Senate Majority Leader Janice Weiner answered questions from reporters about their plans and expectations for the 2026 legislative session at the Iowa Capitol Press Association legislative preview forum Thursday. Republican leaders, House Speaker Pat Grassley, Senate Majority Leader Mike Klimesh and Reynolds, were invited but declined to attend.
The discussion of retirement plans was started by the Iowa DOGE task force, which suggested in August the state might move the public employees’ retirement system from a defined benefits program to a defined contribution program, where both the employee and employer would contribute to the retirement fund.
This proposal was met with significant backlash from public employees and advocates who said the change could endanger IPERS’ solvency. In the task force’s final list of  recommendations submitted to Reynolds, the proposal was changed to suggest Iowa conducts an ongoing study of of public employees’ benefits — which would include examining the viability of a defined contribution plan. If feasible, the task force suggested public employees be allowed to decide if they want to stay on IPERS in its current form or move to a defined contribution plan, while not making changes to IPERS for current public employees.
Several Republican lawmakers have stated there is currently no interest in making changes to IPERS. But Democrats said Thursday that does not mean Iowans should stop paying attention to the issue.
“I keep hearing from Republican colleagues, ‘They don’t have the appetite for it this year,'” Weiner said. “… So my question is, does that mean they’ll have the appetite for it next year, or the year after that? IPERS is a well-run system. It is essential for recruiting and retaining employees for the state of Iowa, for our correctional system, for our law enforcement, our teachers, and we should not meddle with it, period.”
Bagniewski said House Democrats have similar concerns. He pointed to Republicans’ approach in 2017 to changing public sector collective bargaining law and the 2023 Education Savings Account program as examples of policy where Republicans said, “there’s just a proposal, we’re just talking about it, we’re not going to do it. And then all of a sudden, they’re doing it.”
Because Democrats are concerned about Republicans deciding to later move forward with a proposal to change IPERS, Bagniewski said the House minority party plans to introduce a constitutional amendment to “protect IPERS.”
“We’re going to make Iowa Republican put their money where their mouth is,” Bagniewski said. “If they really want to preserve IPERS, then they’re going to have to do it.”
Bagniewski said the proposed constitutional amendment would bar the Legislature from making major changes to the current set-up of IPERS — particularly preventing future changes like the task force’s proposed opt-in or opt-out from the defined benefits program structure. He said this proposal is necessary in order to prevent the Legislature from taking actions that could threaten IPERS stability for both future and current employees.
“The whole system is built on the people who are currently in, paying for the people who retire,” Bagniewski said. So once you take that out, and then you have a deficit, the whole system explodes. So we want to preserve it in its current form by the Constitution.”
Amendments to the state Constitution must be passed by the Iowa Legislature in two consecutive general assemblies, and then go before voters on the next general election ballot. If approved by a simple majority as a ballot measure, the amendment will be adopted.

U.S. District Court Judge Stefan R. Underhill, who is the presiding judge for Diamantis’ upcoming federal trial on corruption charges, suggested that Pattis continue to represent Diamantis at a public defender’s rate.
“If you are asking, then I will do it,” Pattis told the judge during the hearing, which took place Thursday evening on Zoom.
Underhill then said he was going to delay the trial until at least April.
Jury selection for Diamantis’ second corruption trial was supposed to begin on Jan. 30, but Pattis told prosecutors and Underhill that a murder trial that he started this week in New London would not be done by then, and prosecutors said they are preparing for another trial scheduled for March.
Diamantis was found guilty by a jury in October of 21 counts of bribery, extortion, conspiracy and lying to federal investigators in his role as head of the state school construction grants office. He remains free on a $500,000 bond.
Diamantis, Connecticut’s former deputy budget director and a former state legislator, was convicted of using his position overseeing the state’s school construction office to enrich himself and his family by accepting bribes from contractors on school projects in Hartford and Tolland.
Underhill delayed sentencing on that case until after the second trial, where he faces charges related to a Medicaid fraud scheme. Diamantis faces up to 12 years in prison for his October convictions.
Pattis had asked to be removed as Diamantis’ attorney last month, claiming that his client owed him at least $65,000, according to court records. Pattis and Diamantis appeared at a closed-door hearing before the U.S. Magistrate S. Dave Vatti last month to present their cases.
Vatti issued an eight-page ruling late Thursday afternoon just minutes before Underhill’s scheduled status conference with Pattis and federal prosecutors. 
“Diamantis’ failure to fulfill the $65,000 payment obligation is substantial under the circumstances,” Vatti wrote.
“He (Diamantis) objects that he has already paid nearly 75% of the total $250,000 fee and he argues that it is not uncommon for courts to deny requests to withdraw as criminal defense counsel where significant fees have already been paid, the client appears unable to make further payments, and substitute counsel would need time to catch up.”
But Vatti ruled Pattis was “not an indentured servant,” and forcing him to in effect represent Diamantis at a second trial for free was unfair.
Diamantis is facing bribery, extortion and filing false statement charges in the next trial, which centers around a $600,000 payment that Diamantis helped hand-deliver to another state agency to get a Medicaid audit of a Bristol eye doctor canceled.
It was during the height of COVID, in May 2020, when Diamantis and Christopher Ziogas, also a former state representative, hand-delivered a check for nearly $600,000 to the state Department of Social Services in order to reimburse the state Medicaid program for services that the eye doctor Helen Zervas — Ziogas’ fiancée — improperly billed.

After that check was delivered to the Department of Social Services office in Hartford, the audit into Zervas’ optometry practice was dropped, which prevented state auditors from combing through her records and potentially clawing back even more money for the state.
The CT Mirror reported that the audit of Bristol Eye Care was the only one that DSS canceled over a five-year period.
Diamantis and Ziogas previously told the CT Mirror that there was nothing illegal about the $600,000 payment, and they said their involvement had nothing to do with the agency ending the scheduled audit of Zervas’ practice.
But in November, Ziogas pleaded guilty to extortion and bribery charges for his part in pressuring state employees to cancel the audit. He admitted in court that he helped Zervas pay Diamantis $100,000 to help stifle the audit.

Ziogas is scheduled to be sentenced on Feb. 18. Under the plea agreement, he is facing 70 to 87 months in prison. Zervas also pleaded guilty, although a sentencing date has not yet been set.
While their plea agreements do not indicate that they must testify against Diamantis at his trial, Pattis has said he expects both of them will be witnesses for the government.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025_0228_SR_FederalCourtKosta_046-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-08 19:00:01.891722

Delaware officials have released an updated 2025 Climate Action Plan, outlining new long-term strategies to address climate and environmental concerns — even as state and federal data show Delaware already meets or exceeds most existing environmental standards.
The plan, finalized in early 2026, identifies transportation, industrial activity, and electrical power generation as the largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions in the state. It sets a goal of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 and builds on Delaware’s first Climate Action Plan, released in 2021.
State leaders say the update is necessary to address long-term risks such as sea-level rise, rising temperatures, and more frequent severe storms. However, critics and policy observers question whether the new plan responds to regulatory necessity or advances broader policy objectives at a time when Delaware remains in full environmental compliance.
Air Quality Already Meets Federal Standards
According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control, Delaware currently meets all federal air-quality standards under the National Ambient Air Quality Standards.
The state’s EPA-approved air-monitoring network tracks pollutants including ozone, particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, and lead. While particulate readings rose briefly in 2023 due to Canadian wildfire smoke, those incidents were classified as “exceptional events” and did not count against compliance.
Long-term emissions of major air pollutants continue to trend downward, consistent with national reductions driven by cleaner fuels, vehicle standards, and industrial controls.
Water Quality in Compliance, With Ongoing Restoration Efforts
Delaware’s water-quality standards are governed by the federal Clean Water Act and must be reviewed and approved by the EPA every three years. The state’s most recent update took effect Jan. 1, 2023.
DNREC reports Delaware meets federal monitoring and reporting requirements, though it continues long-term restoration efforts in specific watersheds, including the Inland Bays. These efforts operate under EPA-approved Total Maximum Daily Load plans and reflect ongoing improvement work rather than regulatory failure.
Climate Policy Already Exceeds Federal Requirements
Over the past five years, Delaware has adopted climate policies that exceed baseline federal requirements. The 2021 Climate Action Plan and the 2023 Climate Change Solutions Act established binding targets of a 50 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, compared with 2005 levels, and net-zero emissions by 2050.
The state publishes annual implementation reports tracking progress on energy-efficiency programs, electric-vehicle incentives, and building standards. Federal law does not require states to adopt statutory emissions targets or formal climate-action plans.
“Climate change is real, and it is affecting Delaware and Delawareans in serious ways,” said Greg Patterson, secretary of DNREC. He said the updated plan focuses on practical outcomes such as cleaner air, reduced flooding, and improved land-use planning — benefits he said can deliver value regardless of one’s views on climate science.
“We are talking about strategies for cleaner air, more walkable communities, less flooding, more trees and forests, productive farmland, and higher-quality wetlands,” Patterson said.
Aligning With Progressive States — Not High-Growth States
Delaware’s net-zero strategy places the state alongside California, Colorado, Illinois, and Maryland, which have adopted similar long-term emissions mandates.
However, Jane Brady, chairperson of A Better Delaware, has noted that most of the nation’s fastest-growing states — including Florida, Texas, Tennessee, North Carolina, and Arizona — are not pursuing net-zero mandates. Colorado is the lone exception among high-growth states.
Brady has argued that the contrast raises questions about whether net-zero strategies are driven more by political alignment than by demonstrated economic or population-growth outcomes.
“The states experiencing the strongest job and population growth are largely not pursuing net-zero mandates,” Brady has said, pointing out that Delaware already meets federal environmental standards and questioning whether additional climate policies will deliver measurable benefits relative to their costs.
Academic Skepticism on Local Climate Impacts
Some critics also point to statements from former University of Delaware climatologist David Legates, who has questioned whether current global-warming trends pose an immediate or existential threat to life in Delaware.
Legates, who served for decades as Delaware’s state climatologist, has argued that while climate conditions do change over time, there is limited evidence that recent warming trends are endangering human life in the First State. He has noted that challenges such as storms and coastal flooding are longstanding issues that have historically been addressed through infrastructure investment, land-use planning, and emergency preparedness rather than emissions mandates.
Legates has cautioned against framing climate change as a crisis requiring sweeping regulatory or economic action, emphasizing instead adaptation, resilience, and cost-benefit analysis — particularly in states like Delaware that already meet federal environmental standards.
Debate Shifts From Compliance to Policy Direction
Governor Matt Meyer said the updated plan is intended to protect residents while supporting job creation and long-term economic stability. He cited flooding, extreme rainfall, and urban heat as challenges already affecting communities.
Patterson emphasized that the Climate Action Plan is not a fixed mandate but a flexible framework, with scheduled updates in 2027 and 2029 ahead of the next full plan in 2030.
“Actions may change over time based on increased understanding of climate impacts, technology advancements, and stakeholder input,” he said.
With Delaware already meeting federal air and water standards — and exceeding baseline climate-planning expectations — the debate now centers less on environmental compliance and more on how aggressively the state should pursue additional climate policies, at what cost, and with what measurable return for taxpayers, businesses, and families.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/01-TheMostPopularBeachesinCoastalDelaware.webp,,,2026-01-08 18:11:49.589037

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)In the wake of an ICE-related shooting death, a Memphis lawmaker is proposing legislation that would make schools and churches safe havens from Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers.
Democratic Rep. Gabby Salinas filed House Bill 1482 a day after a Minneapolis woman was shot by an ICE agent in her vehicle. The Trump administration said the shooting was justified because the agent was protecting himself and other ICE personnel.
Bystanders’ video posted online shows an officer standing in front of the Honda Pilot fire at the vehicle as it pulls forward after another agent approaches it and orders the driver to open the door and grabs the handle, according to an Associated Press report. The woman, 37-year-old Renee Good, was in Minneapolis as a neutral observer of ICE actions during protests of immigration enforcement following a mass deployment of ICE agents in the city.
Salinas’ bill would prohibit ICE personnel from going onto public school grounds and church properties without notice.
“No child or person should fear being abducted or risk having their family ripped apart when they leave their home,” Salinas said in a statement. “We are losing friends, neighbors, caretakers, and community members daily.”
Federal, state and local agencies, as well as the Tennessee National Guard, have been operating a Memphis Safe Task Force since September.
A researcher at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, Salinas moved to America from Bolivia with her family when she was 7, and she has often spoken about the welcome they received while obtaining citizenship through a bipartisan bill sponsored by U.S. Sen. Fred Thompson, a Tennessee Republican.
Salinas pointed out incidents such as the Minneapolis shooting death show “how lawless and dangerous” ICE interactions with the public have become.
“Now is the time that we as Tennesseans come together and to reject fear and violence and recognize our shared humanity. We are all children of God,” she said.
Salinas is likely to run into hurdles from the Republican supermajority as she tries to pass this legislation.
House Republican leaders are considering whether to bring back a bill that would allow public schools to check the citizenship status of all students and either block enrollment or charge tuition.
House Speaker Cameron Sexton said he plans to roll out a package of immigration-related bills.
Asked about the safe haven bill from ICE, Sexton called it “a terrible idea.”

Phil Murphy speaking at Ramsey High School on Jan. 8, 2026, before signing a bill that will ban cellphones in K-12 classrooms beginning next school year. (Photo by Jake Hirsch/Governor’s Office.)
New Jersey public school districts will be required to bar their students from using cellphones and other smart devices during school hours under a bill signed into law by Gov. Phil Murphy Thursday.
Murphy, a Democrat whose second term ends on Jan. 20, had made banning phones during class a priority of his final year in office. He signed the bill during a ceremony in Ramsey High School, where classrooms have been phone-free for a year already.
Murphy said that within four months of Ramsey High School’s cellphone ban, nearly 80% of teachers reported increased engagement in class and a majority of the faculty observed greater student-to-student interaction, fewer classroom distractions, and more attentive students.
“When you talk to educators and parents in school districts that have enacted similar cellphone bans, you will often hear the same thing. Students are more focused, they’re less anxious, and they are socializing and laughing with each other, not through a screen, but in the hallways and classrooms. So with the legislation I’m signing today, we’re going to fundamentally improve the learning environment for every K-through-12 student by requiring every school district to follow the lead of campuses just like this one,” he said.
Under the new law, the state’s education commission will be required to develop guidelines on restricting the use of cellphones and other internet-enabled devices during regular school hours, on a bus, or during certain school-sanctioned events. Boards of education will then be required to adopt policies consistent with the state guidelines.
The state guidelines will be required to be written within 90 days so the new policies can go into place by the start of the 2026-27 school year.
Students will be able to use their phones in case of an emergency, for translation services, and in cases where the school receives documentation from a health care professional indicating that access to a phone is necessary.
Principals and administrators will also be allowed to make reasonable accommodations for students to use phones for educational purposes.
Bill sponsor Assemblywoman Rosy Bagolie (D-Essex) is the school superintendent in East Newark, where students have had to surrender their cellphones during the school day for the last five years.
“I’ve heard it from students about the state, that even though it’s hard to let go of the device, that they are thankful for the time that they have in school that they don’t have to worry about it anymore. That they don’t have to compete for the attention. That they don’t have to compete with news of what’s happening in the moment,” Bagolie said.
About 16 states have approved “bell-to-bell” cellphone bans in classrooms.
Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill, who takes office at noon on Jan. 20, commended Murphy for signing the bill. During her campaign for governor, Sherrill also said she wanted to limit phones in schools.
“Our young people are facing a mental health crisis — but, we all know that when children put the screens down, their mental health and academic results improve,” Sherrill said in a statement. “I look forward to implementing this important legislation and continuing to make progress on kids’ online safety and holding Big Tech accountable for the content they push toward our kids.”

(Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nonpartisan U.S. Senate candidate Dan Osborn raised $762,000 in the last quarter of 2025, bringing his campaign total for last year to more than $2 million, his team told the Examiner. 
While fundraising reports are still being finalized with the Federal Election Commission, Osborn had 11,857 individual donors in the last quarter, with an average contribution of roughly $37, the campaign says. The Osborn camp says the numbers show the former labor leader is running a “stronger campaign” than his closer-than-expected loss to U.S. Sen Deb Fischer, R-Neb., in 2024. 
Osborn, who has said he is not accepting donations from corporate political action committees but not from union PACs, said his campaign is being “backed by working-class people.” 
Osborn is currently in a heated campaign against Nebraska Republican U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts. Osborn gained national attention for his 2024 bid against Fischer, who beat him by six percentage points in a state where Republicans outnumber Democrats roughly 2 to 1, and nonpartisans make up a growing share of the electorate.

“Pete Ricketts is a billionaire whose war chest will be bankrolled by deep-pocketed corporate interests,” Osborn said. “We have always known that. We have the people behind us, we will always outwork him, and that’s why we will win this U.S. Senate seat.”

Ricketts and his team are trying to paint Osborn as a “fake independent,” pointing to his having received donations and support from Democrats and using fundraising infrastructure often used by Democrats. They’ve also criticized him for paying himself and his wife using campaign funds, which is legal but often comes at a political price.
Will Coup, Ricketts campaign spokesperson, said Osborn is releasing his topline numbers to “avoid scrutiny of what’s actually in his report.”
“Did Osborn continue self-dealing by paying thousands of dollars to a shell company owned by his wife? Did he accept even more funding from Elizabeth Warren and members of the Soros family?” Coup said. “Once again, Fake Dan Osborn is trying to hide his self-dealing, his donors, and his liberal policies from Nebraskans.”

(Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Mike Foley is seeking another four-year term as Nebraska auditor of public accounts, embracing a job designed to help root out fraud, inefficiency and misuse of government resources.
At 71, Foley’s political career in Nebraska has spanned a quarter century, starting as a state senator representing south Lincoln in 2001. In the Legislature, he was a social conservative who often emphasized his opposition to abortion. He was also criticized by some for pressing his faith into public positions.
Nebraska State Auditor’s Office. (Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)
After six years making laws, the Republican won back-to-back terms as state auditor. He ran for governor in the 2014 election and lost in the primary to Pete Ricketts, who later named Foley as his running mate, which led to an eight-year stint as lieutenant governor.
Foley then chose to take another shot at the auditor’s post and voters returned him to the office in 2023. After filing paperwork this week for what would be a fourth term as auditor, though not all consecutive, Foley told the Nebraska Examiner he hadn’t seriously considered any other job.
“I enjoy this work. It’s a good fit for me,” he said. “We have a great team and I think we’re making a difference.”
The auditor provides independent investigations of financial activities of state and local governments. Oversight extends to about 2,700 entities and agencies, Foley said. Findings go to policymakers and taxpayers via reports and Internet-based budget and audit databases.
Foley earned his undergraduate degree from State University of New York at Brockport and a master’s degree from Michigan State University.
Before moving to Nebraska, Foley lived two decades in Washington D.C., where he was director of financial analysis for the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners. He and his wife Susan have six children and four grandchildren.
Foley said he aims to be impartial and “calls it as I see it,” regardless of who is involved.
“I wasn’t hired to look the other way when I find problems,” he said.

Luckert is retiring from the state's highest court. (Photo by Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas Supreme Court Justice Eric Rosen formally stepped into the job of chief justice Thursday by framing the delicate work of the state’s highest court as a crucial public service and proclaiming the citizenry’s diversity of perspective strengthened the rule of law rather than challenged it.
Rosen, who joined the Supreme Court in 2005 after serving a dozen years as a Shawnee County District Court judge, said the rule of law endured not because it was rigid but because its principles could be applied fairly in response to the blended reality of people.
“Over the last 20 years, I have learned that the role of this court is both modest and profound,” he said. “We do not make public policy nor do we do we chase public approval. The oath I swore to you today commands our duty is to interpret and apply the law faithfully, to safeguard constitutional privileges and principles and ensure that justice is administered without fear or favor.”
Rosen said the Supreme Court had to be mindful that the court’s decisions impact the lives of 3 million Kansans and shaped public trust in the judicial branch.
“It is a lived reality that people who come before our courts seek fairness and justice,” Rosen said. “It is complemented by a broader richness of viewpoints and backgrounds that strengthens public trust and deepens our understanding of the law’s impact.”
Rosen was the first Jewish person appointed a district court judge in Kansas and the first in state history to serve on the Supreme Court. He also became Kansas’ first Jewish chief justice. He said he was mindful that being Jewish set him apart in ways that at times were isolating and limiting, but reaching each personal legal milestone wasn’t about distinction for its own sake.
“Equal justice under the law is not self-executed. It requires vigilance. It requires humility and a continued commitment to ensuring that our institutions truly belong to everyone they serve,” Rosen said.
Rosen transitioned to acting chief justice in October after Chief Justice Marla Luckert suffered a stroke. On Jan. 1, Rosen assumed the role of chief justice upon Luckert’s resignation from the position. Rosen moved into the job because of a provision of the Kansas Constitution reserving that role for the justice with the most continuous years of service to the court.
Rosen praised Luckert’s tenure as chief justice and told an audience of about 225 people in the Kansas Judicial Center that he appreciated her steady leadership, integrity and commitment to fairness.
He said the Supreme Court had a duty to honor Luckert’s adherence to principles of thoughtful deliberation, respect for different views and an understanding that justice wasn’t static but something that must be tended with care.
“It’s a bittersweet moment for me to embrace my new charge while preparing to wish a close professional colleague and friend a wonderful, well-earned retirement,” Rosen said.
Luckert, who plans to soon retire from the Supreme Court, said she had worked with Rosen for three decades in the district and appellate courts and recognized he “guarded the principles of fair and equal justice for all litigants.” She said people appearing before Rosen were treated with dignity and assured their disputes would be resolved impartially.
Libby Rosen, the chief justice’s wife, introduced her husband and recalled his pursuit of a dream to leave a career as a school social worker to become a lawyer. He went to law school part-time while raising a family, which offered him important lessons in the precision of words. She recalled Rosen asked his 3-year-old son, who was eating an apple, if he could have a bite.
“Eric paused for a second and went over and bit his father,” she said.
Libby Rosen said that after more than 50 years together the state’s chief justice had shown he was a “calm, fair and reasoned partner as long as it didn’t concern technology.”
She said the couple recently began a daily habit of playing Wordle. She said her skills as a nurse led her to finish faster than her husband. The chief justice, however, was deliberative and considered all angles before advancing in each stage of the game, she said.
“He takes much longer to do it, but he gets it right in fewer tries,” Libby Rosen said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Luckert-and-Rosen-4-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-08 18:00:38.792468

A key Senate committee on Thursday advanced four bills that would give communities more leeway to soften the blow of sudden tax increases. Two of the bills are authored by senators representing Boston who have drawn Wu’s ire for not backing her approach.
The bills are set for a vote on Thursday, January 15, according to a Senate official, as is another measure that would require ballot question committees to more frequently disclose their fundraising and spending.
The sudden movement of the tax bills sets the stage for another round of finger-pointing and political elbowing about the growing burden of residential property taxes in the state’s capital.
As homeowners faced a series of steep increases, Wu tried on several occasions to secure permission from Beacon Hill to temporarily shift some of the burden to businesses. Her plan had buy-in from the House, but it never gained traction in the Senate and then became a vector for renewed cross-branch tension.
After Wu made her latest ill-fated pitch in December, Senate leaders instead began to move a pair of bills from Sen. Nick Collins of South Boston and Sen. Will Brownsberger of Belmont, whose district also includes part of Boston, taking aim at local property-tax issues.
One of those bills that earned the Senate Ways and Means Committee’s approval Thursday would allow communities to create a “tax shock credit,” designed to ease the impact when a residential property tax levy is set to increase more than 10 percent in a single year. Officials say the relief would be targeted to “the most vulnerable taxpayers,” including taxpayers who have a child 6 years old or younger residing at the home in question, people 65 years or older who own and occupy their homes, and households where a member is enrolled in MassHealth.
The other bill would launch an opt-in rebate program providing an added credit to taxpayers who received the residential tax exemption in the prior year for an owner-occupied property.
Senate President Karen Spilka said the slate ready for action, which also includes two others bills that deal with senior property tax deferrals and exemptions, “puts more tools into the toolboxes of municipalities across the state to give a break to the taxpayers most in need.”
Fueled in large part by a post-pandemic shift to remote work, commercial property values in Boston have plummeted in recent years. That in turn has forced more of the city’s property tax burden onto homeowners, who are alreadystaring down major increases to tax bills that arrive in January.
Even with a Senate vote set for next week, it’s unclear when or even whether the new relief measures will become law. House leaders remain frustrated with the approach the Senate took to Wu’s plan, and they appear skeptical about the Brownsberger-Collins alternatives.
Asked last month if the House had any interest in taking up those Senate’s bills, House Speaker Ron Mariano — who at the time was perched near a third-floor ledge in the State House — quipped, “This may cause me to jump.”
The Senate was “critical of the mayor not giving out enough notice” ahead of her latest tax-shift proposal, Mariano said, according to State House News Service. “These guys pulled these bills right out of their back pocket. So I think that we need to understand what their bills do.”
The dust-up is still producing political fallout. Wu last month called out Collins for not supporting her prior version of the tax-shift plan. Meanwhile, Daniel Lander, a senior policy adviser to Wu, in December launched a Democratic primary challenge against Brownsberger.
While Wu has not weighed in on the race, Lander cited Brownsberger’s opposition to the mayor’s tax plan as a reason he decided to run, according to the Dorchester Reporter.
The 2026 elections are also a key theme in the other major bill the Senate teed up for a vote next week.
That proposal, originally filed by Sen. Sal DiDomenico of Everett, would require campaigns pushing statewide ballot questions to submit reports at least once per month, with a bit more frequency closer to the election.
Current law is notoriously lax when it comes to financial disclosures for ballot questions, whose backers and opponents regularly spend millions or tens of millions of dollars trying to sway voters on impactful policy changes.
In 2026, ballot question campaigns do not need to file their next reports until September, allowing influential and well-funded groups to obscure how much money they are pumping into their efforts — and who their backers are — until just a couple of months before the election.
Lawmakers are growing increasingly skeptical of the ballot question process, which is often used by advocates as political leverage on issues that the Legislature does not want to touch.
As many as 12 statewide questions remain in the running to appear before voters this fall, which would smash the previous record of nine questions in a single election. They cover a wide range of thorny topics, such as whether to cut the state’s income tax rate, impose a strict cap on rents across Massachusetts, and repeal the decade-old voter authorization for recreational marijuana.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/12-03_transit_worker_bill_signing_2-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-08 18:00:38.792468

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Republican legislative leaders agreed to pay former Emporia State University president Ken Hush $50,000 to spearhead their efforts to slash spending at public universities.
The five Republican members of the Legislative Coordinating Council, over objections from the panel’s two Democrats, approved a contract Thursday to pay Hush $10,000 per month for five months to be a consultant to the Legislature on higher education budgets. The committee members didn’t mention Hush by name while discussing the deal, but Senate President Ty Masterson, R-Andover, confirmed it was Hush after the meeting.
House Speaker Dan Hawkins, R-Wichita, said Hush would be tasked with finding “efficiencies” in university budgets while the Legislature works to cut annual state spending by $200 million.
Hush retired last month after leading ESU for more than three years. As president, he fired tenured professors without due process and eliminated and added programs without explanation. The so-called “ESU model” cratered student enrollment and required a pair of $9 million bailouts from the Legislature. An investigation by the American Association of University Professors concluded he was unfit to lead.
Hawkins — Hush’s fraternity brother in the early 1980s at ESU — praised Hush’s leadership at ESU during the Thursday meeting.
“He has intimate insight into the higher ed budget arena, and certainly, as everybody knows, we have to be very careful and prudent with the dollars in our budget,” Hawkins said.
The Kansas Board of Regents already initiated plans to evaluate programs and faculty members at the state’s six public universities, and dismiss those who fail to meet expectations. In a brief exchange with reporters, Masterson said the effort was “helpful,” but that he wasn’t sure if it would go far enough. He supported the contract with Hush.
“It’s just valuable to have somebody who’s run a university be able to consult you on some of that, because those are vast budgets with multiple revenue sources,” Masterson said. “It’s gonna be well worth a few dollars spent. And” — he paused to bump this reporter’s shoulder — “we didn’t have a special session this year.”
The comment was in reference to GOP leaders’ failed plans to hold a special session in November 2025 to try to gerrymander U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, a Democrat, out of office. The LCC had allotted $460,000 to fund the special session.
Rep. Blake Carpenter, right, says he has found $100 million in questionable spending by state universities. House Minority Leader Brandon Woodard listens during a Jan. 8, 2026, meeting of the Legislative Coordinating Council. (Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)
Rep. Blake Carpenter, R-Derby, said he supported the move to hire Hush because he and his staff already identified $100 million in what he considered to be “questionable spending” by universities. He said their findings included $75,000 “in travel reimbursements to a vanilla bean manufacturing tour guide in Africa,” $96,000 “to a nutritionist guru specializing in vegan cookbooks,” and $111,000 “to a social justice head-hunting firm specializing in placing executives into leadership positions and nonprofits.”
“So I think that if we’re able to find about $100 million just on our own over the interim with my staff and I looking through these line items, then I think it makes a lot of sense for us to hire an executive that has run one of these universities,” Carpenter said. “They know how they operate, and they can give specific details as to where and how we can be more efficient with these higher education systems. And I think the $100 million at this point is scratching the surface, and we need to continue to dig.”
Senate Minority Leader Dinah Sykes and House Minority Leader Brandon Woodard, both Lenexa Democrats, questioned whether Hush’s work would duplicate the work of the Legislature’s existing budget analysts and research staff.
Sykes also questioned the transparency of handing a costly, no-bid contract to an unnamed consultant without making the plan public in advance of Thursday’s meeting.
“I find it interesting with all the talk we have about finding efficiency in government, and I think we keep growing government, honestly,” she said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/P1080325-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-08 18:00:38.792468

But those flights are about to end anyway: Avelo this week announced that it was suspending its contract with the federal government and would end its charter flights later this month for immigrants targeted for deportation. The contract was worth an estimated $150 million.
“The program provided short-term benefits but ultimately did not deliver enough consistent and predictable revenue to overcome its operational complexity and costs,” Courtney Goff, an Avelo Airlines spokesperson told AZFamily, an Arizona website that broke the news about the suspension of deportation flights.
Customs and Border Protection increases hiring incentives, amid record DHS recruiting year

The airline’s decision to end the immigration charters was part of a broader financial restructuring that the company unveiled earlier in the week.
Activists in Maryland last summer and fall pressured the state government to end its contract with Avelo at BWI, in protest of the ICE deportation flights taking place across the country and President Donald Trump’s immigration policies more generally. Maryland groups targeting Avelo collected thousands of petition signatures, urging Gov. Wes Moore (D) to cancel the state’s contract with the airline.
Similar protests have been taking place all over the country, in cities where Avelo runs flights.
But the Moore administration, which has criticized Trump’s immigration policies, asserted that the state had no power over any ICE flights out of BWI and did not seek to end its contract with Avelo.
Avelo and Maryland signed a deal in 2022 for the carrier to run a limited number of flights to and from other U.S. cities in and out of BWI, the state-owned airport. The contract enables the state or the airline to walk away with 30 days’ notice.
Even if Maryland had ended its arrangement with Avelo for commercial flights at BWI, that would not have prevented Avelo or other carriers from running detainee flights out of the airport.

The data, released by the Oklahoma State Department of Health on Thursday, shows a drop of over 7% in positive influenza cases and 40 fewer hospitalizations during the week of Dec. 28, which is the most recently available data.
The drop followed a spike in positive flu cases and hospitalizations over the Christmas holiday week. 
Positive cases hit a peak of nearly 22% positivity during the week of Dec. 21, according to a flu data dashboard operated by the Oklahoma State Department of Health. Hospitalizations also peaked that week, reaching 165, according to the dashboard. 
Erica Rankin, a spokesperson for the Health Department, said one week of fluctuation is too early to say if cases are truly decreasing. 
Rankin said this week’s dip could be due to a shift in the number of people visiting the doctor or a change in provider reporting with offices having altered hours during the holidays. 
“We have observed an increase in the influenza percent positivity rate in many areas of the state, along with many states across the country,” Rankin said. “This is what we would expect to see this time of year, being in the middle of respiratory season.”
Nationally, the most recent CDC data shows flu cases are elevated and the number of cases continues to increase in most states.
A majority of Oklahoma’s confirmed positive flu cases are a subset of Influenza A strain. Known as the H3N2 subtype, health officials have said the strain is more resistant to the flu shot. 
Rankin said it isn’t too late to get the flu shot. 
“We would encourage individuals to speak with their trusted health care provider to determine if the flu shot is right for them and to bring any concerns or questions they may have to them,” she said in a statement. “Even if the flu shot is not a perfect match to the strain circulating, it can still help to reduce the severity of illness someone may get from the flu.”
The flu dashboard is updated every Thursday, excluding state holidays, using data from the previous Sunday through Saturday.

Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/08/advocates-federal-cutbacks-could-cost-ct-nearly-1-billion/,"Connecticut Voices for Children projects the impending financial hit at nearly $1 billion, more than double the $500 million emergency fund.","For the first time since Congress and President Donald Trump slashed health care and nutrition assistance last July, Connecticut legislators heard a projection of how much the state stands to lose next fiscal year.
It wasn’t pretty.
Connecticut Voices for Children, a New Haven-based policy group, used its 25th annual Tax and Budget Forum Thursday to project the impending financial hit at nearly $1 billion, more than double the $500 million emergency fund legislators created in special session to offset vanishing aid from Washington.
The progressive research organization also offered numerous options to mitigate forces it says are pushing thousands of Connecticut residents into poverty or farther below subsistence levels.
The General Assembly could pump hundreds of millions into health care and food assistance by boosting taxes on the wealthy households that are chief beneficiaries of new federal tax cuts financed with human service program cuts, the organization reported.
But, given 2026 is a state election year and tax hikes are unpopular, lawmakers and Gov. Ned Lamont also could achieve similar results by curbing aggressive state savings policies and by working harder to collect the nearly $4 billion in unpaid taxes Connecticut misses out on annually.
“The income and wealth divides are widening by the day, and it’s on full display when some of the most powerful people and corporations are profiting … while many of our neighbors have no choice but to visit a food pantry to feed their families,” Emily Byrne, executive director of Connecticut Voices, said to open the online forum.
General Assembly must solve next CT budget in February
Since Trump and the GOP-led Congress ordered more than $1 trillion in cuts to various human service programs over the next decade to finance $4.5 trillion in tax relief, Connecticut officials have been waiting to learn how big the local hit would be.
Lamont’s budget staff was supposed to issue projections this fall but did not do so, saying it should wait until after Congress resolves the next federal budget — something that still hasn’t happened.
But the General Assembly must begin revising state finances for the 2026-27 fiscal year when its next regular session starts on Feb. 4. State lawmakers have been bracing for the worst.
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, who has pressed the Lamont administration repeatedly for its analysis of the congressional fiscal mega-bill, said the Connecticut Voices’ tally seems on the mark.
That $1 billion gap reflects not only cuts to Medicaid and to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, but also vanishing federal tax assistance to families that purchase health insurance offered through the state exchange.
Connecticut Voices’ analysts assume about 150,000 state residents would lose health insurance, either because policies on the exchange have become unaffordable or due to cuts in federal Medicaid funding.
And though the state Department of Social Services estimated as many as 36,000 residents here would become ineligible for SNAP benefits by March 31 because of new work requirements and other rules changes Congress ordered in July, other changes will continue to tighten the program over the coming decade. By the early 2030s, Connecticut Voices estimates those removed from the program here will approach 58,000.
Considering both cuts to human service programs and federal tax relief, the poorest 20% of households are estimated to lose more than $1,600, on average, in annual resources, while the richest 10% are projected to gain more than $9,200, Connecticut Voices’ analysts project.
The General Assembly this fall set aside $500 million from last fiscal year’s $2.5 billion surplus to backfill vanishing federal aid in certain human service programs. Lamont already has directed $168 million from that fund to assist food pantries, Planned Parenthood and programs to combat homelessness. The administration also dedicated another $70 million to mitigate cutbacks in federal assistance for health insurance premiums.
Lamont’s direct control over the $500 million ends when the General Assembly reconvenes Feb. 4, but Ritter said he expects lawmakers will continue working with the governor to spend the rest of those funds, and possibly more, to soften the harshest cuts to human service programs.
“We have, I think, a responsibility to do the best we can to help our residents,” the speaker said, adding he remains hopeful that if Democrats gain control of at least one chamber of Congress during the November 2026 elections, some of the federal budget policies can be reversed.
Report: Poverty was growing in CT before federal cuts
Connecticut Voices argues in its report that Connecticut’s middle class had been slipping closer to poverty — and its poor falling even further — well before last July.
Over the past three years, the share of Connecticut residents living in or near poverty ticked up from 21.8% to 22.8%, according to the Supplemental Poverty Measure, a metric that considers not only household income and expenses but also public assistance benefits.
That is aligned with findings reported last September by the United Way of Connecticut, which found a record-high 581,000 Connecticut households, about 40%, couldn’t afford a basic “survival” budget in 2023.
“If the state does not act, and holding all other factors constant, the new federal policies will lead to even more low- and middle-income households struggling to make ends meet and higher poverty rates,” Connecticut Voices’ research and policy director, Patrick O’Brien, wrote in his report for the forum.
Connecticut is home to some of the most extreme income and wealth inequality in the country.
The top 1% of households nationally, or those who earn more than $730,000 per year according to CNBC, have an average income of $2.27 million per year, about 127 times the average earnings of the poorest 20%, which is $17,870, O’Brien said.  
But in Connecticut the top 1% enjoy a much wider gap, averaging $3.66 million in yearly income or almost 183 times that of the $20,050 earned by the poorest 20%. 
CT could tax the rich – or save less – to help poor and middle class
Given that taxpayers with incomes topping $500,000 per year are slated to receive one-third of the entire federal tax break — which is paid for, in part, with deep cuts to assistance programs — Connecticut Voices’ officials repeated recommendations they’ve made in several recent forums for state tax hikes on some the highest earners.
Adding or adjusting business tax surcharges could raise as much as $110 million per year.
Similarly, placing a surcharge on the capital gains-related earnings of households with overall income that exceeds $500,000 per year would generate $235 million.
Raising the effective tax rate on Connecticut’s largest estates could collect up to an extra $70 million.
And if state officials don’t want to talk tax hikes while running for reelection this year, there are other ways to raise funds, O’Brien noted.
The state has used an aggressive series of budget caps to force unprecedented surpluses since 2017. Unspent dollars have averaged more than $1.8 billion annually over the last eight years, a huge total that represents 8% to 9% of the General Fund. One cap alone that restricts legislators’ ability to spend certain income and business tax receipts has captured an average of $1.5 billion per year.
Connecticut has used those dollars to bolster its reserves and whittle down its pension debt, which still exceeds $33 billion, according to Lamont’s budget office.
Many Democrats in the legislature have criticized the caps in recent years, arguing they force excessive surpluses and draw needed funds from health care, education, municipal aid and other core programs.
Connecticut Voices’ analysts say moving between $925 million or more from this savings program and into the budget would eliminate the need for any tax hikes.
They also note the state projects a $3.7 billion annual “tax gap” that reflects the difference between what is owed and collected. If Connecticut were to increase auditing staff sufficient to reduce that gap by even 10%, it would provide almost $400 million extra annually to mitigate losses in federal aid.
But minority Republicans in the General Assembly, as well as many moderate Democrats, are expected to fight many of these proposals.
House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, said Thursday that his caucus still favors a major state income tax cut aimed solely at Connecticut’s middle class. The House GOP in October pitched increasing an income tax credit that offsets local property tax bills by as much as $700 per filer.
But Candelora said Republicans aren’t looking to boost taxes on any households or businesses at this time and added Connecticut officials should try to find efficiencies in the existing state budget if they want to identify money to offset federal cutbacks to human service programs.
Lamont, a moderate Democrat, has steadfastly opposed increasing taxes on Connecticut’s wealthy, including finance investments in social programs, arguing that doing so would prompt higher earners to flee the state.
The governor also has been wary about changing any of Connecticut’s budget caps, despite complaints from his fellow Democrats in the legislature.
Lamont did sign the first major state income tax rate cut into law three years ago, which gave middle class families about $300 per year. And his budget spokesman, Chris Collibee, noted the governor recently secured legislative approval for a new endowment to dramatically expand affordable child care, largely by using state surplus dollars.
Collibee didn’t comment on specific proposals from Connecticut Voices but added that “Gov. Lamont is eager to hear any thoughtful ideas that can help make life more affordable for Connecticut families.”
Byrne said that “affordability” is a popular buzz word “that politicians feel compelled to say,” adding that it’s unclear which households’ budgets leaders are trying to assist.
“While the state may not have created the chaos we’re experiencing, it owns it now,” Byrne added. “And so the choices made by elected [state officials] will determine whether federal harms are made worse or mitigated.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025_0203_SR_HousingPolicy051-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-08 18:00:38.792468
,DC,2026-01-08 22:19:47+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,US House backs extension of health insurance subsidies after Dems force vote,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-backs-extension-health-insurance-subsidies-after-dems-force-vote,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. House approved a bipartisan bill Thursday to resurrect the enhanced tax credits that expired at the end of last year for people who purchase their health insurance from the Affordable Care Act marketplace.The 230-196 vote sends the legislation to the Senate, where Republican leadership is unlikely to put it on the floor without considerable changes, which a bipartisan group of senators appears close to finalizing. Seventeen Republicans voted with every Democrat to pass the bill. House GOP leaders didn’t want to bring the bill up in their chamber, but a handful of their own members signed a discharge petition in December, forcing the vote amid rising health care costs. Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Jim McGovern said during floor debate on Wednesday evening “it’s about damn time” the chamber took up a bill to address the now-expired tax credits, arguing lawmakers have a “moral obligation to act” to help people afford health insurance.“This Congress musters up the will to spend trillions of dollars on tax breaks for billionaires and to send the Pentagon billions of dollars more than they even asked for. And the administration came up with tens of billions of dollars to bail out Argentina, for God’s sake,” McGovern said. “But somehow helping moms and dads, grandparents and kids afford trips to the doctor is a step too far for this Republican leadership.”New York GOP Rep. Mike Lawler said he only backed the bill after Republican leaders declined to bring up a bipartisan two-year compromise bill he helped negotiate last year. “I am voting in favor of this discharge and of this legislation to send it to the Senate so that the Senate will have the opportunity to put forth a reform package that can pass Congress and become law,” Lawler said. Republicans and Democrats, he said, agree that the country’s health care system is in need of a serious overhaul. He called on his colleagues to find solutions to the bigger, more structural issues. “Enough of the blame game on both sides,” Lawler said. “Let’s focus on actually delivering affordable health care for Americans.”Prolonged fight over ACA tax credits Democrats originally established the enhanced ACA marketplace tax credits during the coronavirus pandemic in an attempt to get more people health insurance coverage. They set the subsidies to expire at the end of 2025.The debate over the sunset date simmered in the background for much of last year but surged to the forefront in October after Democrats shut down the government and repeatedly demanded GOP leaders negotiate an extension to the expiring enhanced tax credits.The shutdown ended in mid-November after Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., agreed to give Democrats a vote on a health care bill of their choosing in December. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., ultimately decided to bring up a three-year extension of the enhanced tax credits without any changes, but it failed to get the 60 votes needed to advance.A proposal from Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy and Idaho Sen. Mike Crapo, both Republicans, that would have provided funding through Health Savings Accounts for some ACA marketplace enrollees during 2026 and 2027 also failed to move toward final passage. A House Republican health care bill passed that chamber last month, but doesn’t have the bipartisan support to move through the Senate and become law. Senate problemsThune said Tuesday any renewal of the enhanced ACA marketplace subsidies would need reforms to move through that chamber.The bill, he said, would need to set income limits on who qualifies for the enhanced tax credit and eliminate ACA health insurance plans that have $0 premiums, a feature Republicans allege allowed insurance companies to enroll people without their knowledge to receive the subsidy. “And then the second component would be some sort of a bridge to (Health Savings Accounts). An expansion of HSAs so that you're getting more money into the pockets of the American people, the patients, if you will, the consumers, as opposed to insurance companies,” Thune said. “And then finally you've got to deal with the Hyde issue.”The Hyde Amendment has been a feature of government spending bills for decades, preventing federal dollars from going to abortions unless the pregnancy is the result of rape, or incest, or threatens the woman’s life. Republicans want the prohibition to apply to all ACA marketplace health insurance plans without any way for Americans to pay for the coverage themselves, the way they do now. Democrats have rejected the change as a non-starter that would restrict abortion access in blue states. ‘Be a little flexible on Hyde,’ says TrumpPresident Donald Trump waded into that debate this week, telling House Republicans during a policy retreat at the Kennedy Center they must be “flexible” about the Hyde Amendment in order to broker a health care deal that can reach his desk. ""You have to be a little flexible on Hyde. You know that. You’ve got to be a little flexible,” Trump said. “You’ve got to work something. You’ve got to use ingenuity. You’ve got to work. We’re all big fans of everything, but you’ve got to have flexibility.""Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America President Marjorie Dannenfelser rebuked Trump for the comment, writing in a statement that to “suggest Republicans should be ‘flexible’ is an abandonment of this decades-long commitment. If Republicans abandon Hyde, they are sure to lose this November.”States have a patchwork of laws addressing abortion coverage in ACA  marketplace health insurance plans, with 25 prohibiting coverage with certain exceptions and 12 requiring abortion coverage, according to analysis from the nonpartisan health research organization KFF.“In states that do not bar coverage of abortions on plans available through the Marketplace, insurers may offer a plan that covers abortions beyond the permissible Hyde amendment situations when the pregnancy is a result of rape, or incest or the pregnant person’s life is endangered, but this coverage cannot be paid with federal dollars.”Any ACA marketplace health insurance plan that offers abortion coverage in circumstances outside those three exceptions must charge each enrollee $1 for that coverage, according to KFF.Behind the scenes in the SenateA bipartisan group of senators has been talking behind the scenes for months about how to extend the ACA marketplace subsidies with changes. Ohio Republican Sen. Bernie Moreno said Thursday he expects the group, which has agreed on a “framework,” to release a bill next week, though he cautioned that’s just one small step. “We have agreement that we think we have a skeleton of a deal. But it's all fun and games until you have it on paper in a bill form,” Moreno said. “So we have to do that. And then we have to go sell the heck out of it to our conference. And again, look, this is politics. There's people on both sides that want this to fail. So we have to get past that massive mountain.”

Moreno said the tentative plan is to revive the enhanced ACA marketplace tax credit for another two years with modifications.The bill would also: Extend open enrollment for this year until March 1.Cap the enhanced subsidy for people making under 700% of the federal poverty level, or about $109,550 in annual income for one person, according to the guidelines for 2025.Require people eligible for the enhanced tax credit to pay at least $5 per month or $60 per year for their health insurance to ensure the enrollee knows about their coverage.Fine insurance companies $1,000 for “deliberately causing fraud, meaning signing someone up without their consent.”ACA marketplace enrollees eligible for the enhanced tax credit would have a choice in 2027 to either keep the lower premium that stems from the health insurance company receiving the subsidy, or move to a Health Savings Account where they would receive the money from the government. “The final piece, which I think is the biggest sweetener to the whole deal, is putting back in place cost-sharing reduction payments, which, according to (the Congressional Budget Office), reduce premiums for everybody in the exchange by 11% and save the federal government money,” Moreno said, later clarifying that would happen in 2027.  There is not yet a final proposal regarding how ACA marketplace plans handle abortion coverage in states where it's allowed, he said. The handshake agreement, Moreno said, is intended to give Congress time to overhaul the bigger issues facing the country’s health insurance and health care systems in a way that reduces costs.Gang of negotiatorsMoreno said the core group of negotiators, which he nicknamed the EPTCOG gang on his text chain, includes six Democrats and five of his Republican Senate colleagues. There are 24 senators total in the “extended OG” gang. Moreno believes one of his advantages in the negotiations is that he hasn’t been around the Senate that long, having just been elected in 2024. He said senators are also handling the details themselves, instead of deferring much of the work to staff. “This has been principals only. We don't even allow staff in meetings,” Moreno said. “And the idea is if we can't work it out, there's really no point in tasking this with staff.”New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, one of the negotiators, said Wednesday she wasn’t aware of a deadline for the negotiators to release a bill. She also brushed aside the possibility of changes to how the ACA handles abortion coverage. “There is no need to come to a compromise because it's already been dealt with in the Affordable Care Act,” Shaheen said. “There is very specific language on how it is dealt with. And I think that applies to whatever happens with the Affordable Care Act.”Shaheen said Thursday the House vote “provides momentum” for Senate negotiators.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2026-01-08 18:00:38.792468

The No. 2 Republican in the Vermont House, Rep. Casey Toof of St. Albans Town, will resign his seat next week. Toof has served as assistant minority leader since 2023 and has represented his Franklin County town in the chamber since 2019.
The 40-year-old said he’s leaving the House after starting a new job in November as town manager of St. Albans Town. He and his wife also had a third child last July, he said; the combination of the job’s workload, and a larger family, has meant he’s had less time to devote to legislating.
“Working five minutes from home is a lot easier for me to justify than driving to Montpelier every day,” he said Thursday.

Toof has spent his entire tenure assigned to the House Education Committee. Last year, he was one of the voices pushing Republican Gov. Phil Scott’s priorities during the fierce debate over lawmakers’ sweeping education reform plan, Act 73. Toof said the fact that many of the law’s key provisions are still to be hashed out made his decision to leave the Statehouse this year more difficult.
Toof’s resignation does not take effect until Jan. 16, but House Speaker Jill Krowinski, D-Burlington, has already moved him off the education committee. She replaced him with another representative, Milton GOP Rep. Leland Morgan, on Tuesday. Toof was moved, somewhat ceremonially, to the House Agriculture, Food Resiliency, and Forestry Committee.
Toof said the shuffling, which he supported, would allow Morgan to participate in some of the education panel’s introductory hearings this week focused on Act 73 and its next steps.
Scott has not yet named Toof’s replacement. Toof’s House leadership role has already been filled, however, by Rep. Mark Higley, R-Lowell, who previously served as second assistant minority leader, Higley said Thursday.
Rep. Tom Burditt, R-Rutland, now has Higley’s old job, Higley said.
In addition to serving in the House, Toof managed Republican Lt. Gov. John Rodgers’ winning campaign for that office in 2024.
Toof is set to be the fourth House member to resign since the end of the 2025 session in June. Jim Harrison, a Chittenden Republican, stepped down Tuesday; Heather Surprenant, a Barnard Democrat, resigned in September; and Mari Cordes, a Bristol Democrat, resigned in June.

Kelly Ayotte speaks at the Executive Council meeting on Jan. 7, 2026. (Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)New Hampshire child care providers are being urged not to panic by state officials and lawmakers as news spreads that the Trump administration froze federal child care subsidies in five Democratic states earlier this week. 
At an Executive Council meeting on Wednesday, Councilor Joseph Kenney of Wakefield questioned Lori Weaver, commissioner for the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services, for an update on the status of the state’s federal funding for child care, despite it not being on the agenda. 
“We have not had any of our child care [funding] cut,” Weaver said. “There’s a lot of media out there to do about Minnesota, and there’s been talk of that, but we are still doing business as usual right now. We have no official word, no notice.” 
On Monday, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services also announced a rule-change proposal for the Child Care Development Fund, the primary source of federal child care funding in New Hampshire. 
If approved, the proposal would allow states to change how payments to child care programs are calculated, from the number of children enrolled to the number of children in attendance each day or week. It would also remove the requirement for states to pay child care providers upfront for care subsidies and reinstate parent-directed vouchers. 
Karen Hebert, director of the division of economic stability, told the council that the department “hasn’t had any changes” to its payment processes and that the proposal could take “weeks or months” to be approved. 
She said if the proposal gets approved, the state Department of Health and Human Services “would then take whatever steps we need to comply with those changes.” 
Providers have said that a change in how payments are distributed could be costly for programs and the families they serve. 
Gov. Kelly Ayotte reaffirmed the importance of the Child Care Scholarship Program, which is funded by the Child Care Development Fund, after the council meeting. 
“I can tell you, the Child Care Scholarship Program is really important to me,” Ayotte said. “We have federal money, but also often have some state portion. So we tend to look at things very carefully.” 
Ayotte also said she and Weaver discuss fraud “all the time,” and that New Hampshire “is not Minnesota.” 
Providers were also briefed directly about what is going on at the federal level.
In a meeting with child care providers on Thursday, Jotham Spreeman, administrator of operators at the Bureau of Child Development and Head Start, aimed to clear up “panic” and “concern.” 
“The three main things to keep track of is to continue to maintain those accurate records like you probably already are, comply with any documentation requests with licensing or from [the department], and then prepare in case we [need] extra information,” Spreeman said.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/P1075254-Ayotte-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-08 18:00:38.792468

(Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)Six victim advocacy groups announced Thursday a new initiative to help the public better protect kids in response to several high-profile cases of child abuse and sex trafficking that dominated headlines in 2025.
Advocates said the new organization, called the North Dakota HOPE Project, was prompted by events like the criminal conviction of former state Sen. Ray Holmberg, who last March was sentenced to 10 years in prison for a child sex crime.
“For many survivors, 2025 felt like a year of nonstop retraumatization,” Stacy Schaffer, executive director of the 31:8 Project, said in a statement announcing the project. “This initiative is about reminding survivors that help exists — and reminding communities that exploitation is preventable.”

The acronym HOPE stands for healing, outreach, prevention and empowerment.
Greg Kasowski, executive director of the Children’s Advocacy Centers of North Dakota, said his organization served more than 3,000 children and families in 2025. About 1,000 children were “suspected of being abused or interviewed by a forensic interviewer,” he said at a Thursday press conference.
“Each one of those cases could have — should have — been prevented,” he said.
Kasowski called on North Dakotans to learn the signs of sex trafficking and how to respond appropriately.
“We have some opportunities today to make 2026 a year where we stop being reactive, and start being proactive,” he said.
To help educate the public, HOPE Project is hosting a six-part free webinar series that focuses on human trafficking awareness and child online safety.
The first webinar takes place Jan. 13 at 1 p.m. To register, visit the North Dakota HOPE Project’s website.
During the press conference, advocates also called attention to the help available to survivors of abuse, including medical services, shelters and other support. A list of resources is also available on the group’s website.

“I want people to understand that human trafficking is not rare,” she said during the press conference. “I am just one survivor among many.”
Nikki asked to be identified only by first name. The Monitor does not identify victims of sex crimes.
Nikki said survivors like her need “safety, support and understanding.”
“By learning the signs, starting conversations and supporting prevention and survivor centered services we can help ensure that no one has to face exploitation alone,” she said.
Nikki said she’s been able to heal thanks to resources offered by organizations like the ones involved in the North Dakota HOPE Project. She’s now pursuing her bachelor’s degree in social work, she said.
Advocates on Thursday applauded a new law adopted by the 2025 Legislature that requires all sixth, 10th and 12th graders in public schools to undergo education about human trafficking awareness and prevention.
“It is meant to complement, not replace, the broader accountability that we are talking about today,” said Mark Heinert, executive director of Youthworks. 
He noted the need for more training geared toward adults.
 “Youth education is strongest when it’s paired with adults who are paying attention,” Heinert said.
The six organizations working together on the North Dakota HOPE Project are the 31:8 Project, Central Dakota Forensic Nurse Examiners, Children’s Advocacy Centers of North Dakota, North Dakota Domestic & Sexual Violence Coalition, Families Flourish ND and Youthworks.
Sen. Dick Dever, a Bismarck Republican who serves on the Legislature’s Protection and Victim Services Committee, attended the event. The committee this interim session is studying topics including state laws related to crimes against children and human trafficking, and current services available to survivors.
Dever said he’d “like to do whatever we can” to further support organizations like the North Dakota HOPE Project. He noted that in recent years the Legislature has taken steps including establishing the Human Trafficking Commission under the Attorney General’s Office in 2015.

The attorney for a Rutland County man facing a murder charge in a fatal crash that killed an officer is asking a judge to reconsider an order holding his client without bail, citing an internal affairs report that strongly criticizes the actions of police leading to the deadly chase.
David Sleigh, a lawyer for 22-year-old Tate Rheaume, in recent court filings based his request largely on an internal affairs report made public in November. The report noted policy violations by Rutland City officers in the pursuit that led to the death of a fellow officer, 19-year-old Jessica Ebbighausen.
The internal affairs report became public through a court filing by Sleigh in the case against Rheaume, who is facing an aggravated murder charge in the death of Ebbighausen during the high-speed Rutland chase in July 2023.

Sleigh wrote in filings that he learned of the internal affairs investigation conducted by a city police commander through depositions of officers in the case and then subpoenaed it from the city police department.
The internal report stated that Ebbighausen’s death was “preventable” if officers had followed the proper procedures. The policy violations, according to the report, ranged from not having the proper authority to initiate the pursuit to not following procedures while the chase was underway.
“(I)t is now beyond dispute that the initiation and conduct of the pursuit leading to the fatal crash was unlawful and conducted in violation of applicable statutes, rules, and policies,” Sleigh wrote in his recent filings. 
“Disturbingly,” the attorney added, “the findings of the internal investigation were purposefully
withheld from the defense in a deliberate attempt to deprive him of a fair trial.”
Sleigh wrote in the filings in Rutland County Superior criminal court that Rutland City police leadership kept silent about the report’s findings for months.
He cited a Brady letter Rutland County State’s Attorney Ian Sullivan, the lead prosecutor in the case, issued against retiring Rutland City Police Chief Brian Kilcullen, as well as retired Rutland City Police Commander Sam Delpha, who conducted and authored the report. 
A Brady letter, which gets its name from a national court case, is filed when an officer’s credibility is called into question.
Sullivan wrote in that letter that Kilcullen and Delpha had improperly failed to disclose the findings of the internal affairs report that criticized police officers for their roles in the vehicle pursuit to “shape” the case against Rheaume. However, Sullivan said in a recent court filing that any possible police department policy violations do not negate Rheaume’s criminal responsibility in the case.
“The IA report is replete with evidence that will illuminate the RCPD’s bias and motivation to obscure the truth relating to the fatal crash,” Sleigh wrote in his recent filings. “All of that will be introduced to challenge the credibility of the State’s critical witnesses.”
Kilcullen announced his retirement last month, and has not responded to requests for comment about what prompted that decision to leave.
The pursuit leading to the murder charge against Rheaume, according to police, ended on Woodstock Avenue in Rutland when he slammed nearly head-on into a cruiser driven by Ebbighausen.
Ebbighausen had been with the Rutland City Police Department as a part-time officer and was set to begin training the following month to get her full-time certification. 
Rheaume, 22, was also injured in the crash. He was charged shortly after the incident with grossly negligent operation of a motor vehicle with a resulting death and attempting to elude police leading to a fatal crash.
Several months later, Rheaume was arraigned on the upgraded charges, including the aggravated murder count, and has been held without bail since then. 
The charges were upgraded following additional investigation into the crash by both Vermont and New York state police. According to that investigation, Rheaume engaged in dangerous driving at high speeds on the heavily traveled Woodstock Avenue, also known as Route 4, before the crash.
Rheaume, through an earlier attorney who was representing him at that time, challenged the court order holding him without bail. However, the Vermont Supreme Court ruled in August 2024 that Rheaume would remain behind bars while the case against him remained pending. 
Sleigh argued in his filings that the most recent revelations in the internal affairs report “substantially” weakened the state’s case against his client, warranting a striking of the order that Rheaume be held without bail.
In a 16-page response he wrote along with Rutland County Deputy State’s Attorney Daron Raleigh, Sullivan said he opposed Sleigh’s request to the court. According to the prosecutors, the findings of the internal affairs report do not change that it was Rheaume who was driving the truck that struck and killed Ebbighausen.
“Mr. Rheaume was the one who pressed his accelerator until he was traveling at an extremely high rate of speed; Mr. Rheaume was the one who chose to turn into Officer Ebbighausen’s lane of travel; Mr. Rheaume is the one who took no evasive action before hitting Officer Ebbighausen; and Mr. Rheaume is the one who did not brake,” the prosecutors wrote.
“Those actions and inactions by Mr. Rheaume are the natural and continuous sequence of events that killed Officer Ebbighausen,” the prosecutors added. “That sequence of events did not require any actions by another person to come into being.”
Sleigh said Thursday that, should the judge hold a hearing on his request seeking his client’s release, one of the people he would want to testify would be Kilcullen.
Sleigh has called on state and federal authorities to investigate Kilcullen for criminal charges, including obstruction of justice, for his handling of the internal affairs matter and failure to disclose its findings. 
Sullivan declined to comment Thursday.
Rheaume is currently held at the Springfield prison. If convicted of the aggravated murder charge — the most serious state criminal charge — he faces up to life behind bars without the possibility of parole.

“American was born in Pennsylvania, and this identity is deeply rooted in agriculture,” said state Agriculture Secretary Russell Redding at Thursday’s unveiling. “It’s on all of us to stand here … (and) take time to look around, think about all of these farms and planting across the commonwealth who, every day, allow us to enjoy the life that we live.”
Made with 1,000 pounds of butter, this year’s sculpture includes the likeness of the nation’s founding fathers signing the Declaration of Independence at Independence Hall in Philadelphia alongside the Liberty Bell and Betsy Ross.

Tilted, “A Toast to Our Nation’s 250th Anniversary: Inspired by Founders. Grown by Farmers,” the work was designed and crafted by Jim Victor and Marie Pelton of Conshohocken, who have made 24 butter sculptures for the annual event. 
“It’s an honor to be part of the tradition every year,” said Victor. “Especially for this commemorative year, the 110th Farm show and the 250th anniversary of our nation.”
The butter was donated by Land O’Lakes in Cumberland County. When the Farm Show wraps up, it will be recycled at Reinford Farms in Juniata County, which will convert it into renewable energy in a methane digester. 
Nearly 600,000 Pennsylvanians work in the agricultural industry, which contributes $132.5 billion to the state’s economy annually, according to the state ag department.

Santiago/Getty Images)Despite vows to restrict immigration authorities’ access to Washington state Department of Licensing information, the data sharing continued in a new form, researchers revealed Thursday.
The University of Washington Center for Human Rights reports that federal immigration agents searched Department of Licensing data before stopping drivers at least nine times between August and November.
State officials say they cut off U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement access to this data in mid-November.
In a joint statement, the licensing department and Washington State Patrol said Gov. Bob Ferguson “stands prepared to take further action” in the face of the Trump administration’s escalating immigration enforcement tactics.
“But he will do so with reason and care,” the agencies said. “Governor Ferguson is committed to complying with applicable laws and finding the right balance in protecting individuals’ data without compromising legitimate law-enforcement investigations of criminal acts that are necessary to preserve public safety.”
The researchers say U.S. Customs and Border Protection still has access to the data, but the state argues that’s necessary for the agency’s work at the Canadian border and airports.
The state’s Keep Washington Working Act, passed in 2019, prevents state data from being shared with federal authorities for civil immigration purposes. Washington is one of 19 states that offer driver’s licenses regardless of immigration status.
Concerns over federal access to this state data date back to at least 2018. But the worries have ramped up in the past year as President Donald Trump has pushed for drastic increases in immigration enforcement and deportations. The Trump administration has focused on accessing various troves of state data to apparently fuel its immigration operations. 
Over the summer, KING 5 revealed continued data sharing through the Department of Licensing’s driver and plate database, known as DAPS. The investigation found hundreds of searches of Washington records after Trump retook office, prompting outcries from immigration advocates.
After this, state officials announced they’d stop ICE from accessing Washington’s driver license data through this avenue.
Malou Chávez, executive director of the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, said it’s “clear that there are cracks in systems here in Washington state that need fixing to truly protect our communities.”
“Washington, as a welcoming state, cannot and should not aid the federal government in its goal of mass detention, mass deportation by providing access to information, allowing our data to be used for civil immigration enforcement when we have laws specifically prohibiting this from happening,” she told reporters.
How it works
The form of data sharing revealed Thursday forces federal agencies to use a different route than the one that drew scrutiny last year. 
It’s facilitated by a nonprofit that police agencies use to share driver’s license data across states. This allows them to easily search through a platform known as Nlets for information on drivers from out of state that officers pull over. 
A Washington State Patrol platform called ACCESS allows users into the state’s data held by Nlets. The Department of Licensing data shared through this platform includes drivers’ license numbers and photos, home addresses and vehicles’ registered owners, according to the UW researchers.
So, for example, agents could stake out a business, run the license plates of all the cars parked there to get the owners’ names, then look up their immigration statuses and arrest them. 
The UW center’s report includes instances where the licensing department information has been used. 
In one case in November, ICE agents saw a Washington resident in Oregon leaving a Latino grocer. They ran his license plate through the Washington State Patrol system, then searched his name through their own database and found he wasn’t authorized to be in the country, according to the report.
Federal authorities pulled over his vehicle and arrested him, according to researchers.
“These folks are real Washingtonians who have been affected,” said Angelina Godoy, director of the UW Center for Human Rights. “They are people with lives and families and communities and rights, and they have been harmed by the fact that the DOL allows these agencies to access its data for civil and not criminal immigration enforcement.”
Call for action
In November, Democrats in Congress alerted many states that they were unknowingly sharing information with ICE.
In letters to the states’ governors, they noted Washington, along with Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota and New York, had blocked ICE access to their driver’s license data. They wrote that Washington made the move after “engaging with Congressional Democrats.”
Washington state officials said “thousands of attempted queries from ICE have been denied” since shutting off access to Nlets data on Nov. 19.
But this still leaves the door open for U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Homeland Security Investigations, an ICE subagency, to continue searching Washington’s data, the UW researchers believe. 
Customs and Border Protection conducted the data searches in eight of the nine arrests the center documented. Almost all of the arrests were for civil immigration enforcement, not criminal matters. Though when searching the data, the federal agencies don’t need to note if it’s for a criminal or civil investigation. 
“The state is granting them that access on the good faith assumption that they’re only going to use it for criminal investigations, and the data that we’ve presented here shows that that is not the case,” Godoy said. “They are using it in ways that are contrary to state law.”
The researchers called on the state to block all federal immigration authorities from accessing Washington’s Nlets data. 
“We are reviewing CBP’s use of Nlets, what actions other states have taken, and are looking at all options to protect Washingtonians while also protecting public safety,” reads the statement from the Department of Licensing and state patrol.

SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 
In an executive order in September, Ferguson ordered state agencies to “continue to review their data collection, sharing, and retention policies to ensure they are treating the protection of residents’ personal and private information as a matter of public interest and safety.”
The letters to governors, led by Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, said that in the year preceding Oct. 1, federal immigration authorities searched driver’s license databases roughly 900,000 times across the country. 
The center expected to receive records Thursday on other arrests tied to the state data. Godoy said the nine cases documented so far “likely represent the tip of the iceberg.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ice-officer-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-08 17:12:36.355412
,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-08 21:57:57+00:00,CT Mirror,CT minimum wage increases to $16.94. Gov. Lamont celebrates impact,P.R. Lockhart,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/08/minimum-wage-increase-ct/,"The state’s most recent increase, announced in the fall, has pushed CT to one of highest statewide minimum wages in the country.","For more than a decade, business owner Rory Gale has run Hartford Prints!, using her downtown Hartford storefront to sell cards, state-themed apparel and home goods. The business, which recently expanded its longtime location on Pratt Street, has become a popular destination in Hartford, serving as a shining example of the city’s efforts to revitalize downtown. 
Gale said the business’s success is the result of factors ranging from strong community support to local grant funding. At a press conference Thursday morning, Gale said state policy has helped her, too — particularly Connecticut’s indexed minimum wage, which rose to $16.94 on Jan. 1. 
“I have hired so many employees over the years, and feel so proud to be in a state that has a minimum wage like Connecticut,” she said.
Since the state legislature passed a schedule of increases in 2019, Connecticut’s minimum wage has increased annually. In recent years, those increases have been tied to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ federal Employment Cost Index, which measures the changes in the cost of labor for businesses. 
The state’s most recent increase, announced in the fall, has pushed Connecticut to one of highest statewide minimum wages in the country, surpassed only by Washington, which has a wage of $17.13 an hour.
Connecticut state officials said that at a time of increased economic strain across the state and the country, a higher minimum wage helps workers get a foothold they desperately need. 
“You hear about affordability, and a lot of that is bringing down costs, and that’s also about paying people a wage that helps them survive,” Gov. Ned Lamont said Thursday. “That’s what we’re trying to do with this wage right now.”
‘This is not just something for teenagers‘
The minimum wage increase was an early priority during Lamont first term. He’s now campaigning for a third term and seeking the support of labor organizations and workers. The governor said his work to raise the minimum wage has helped many, particularly workers of color who are overrepresented in the state’s minimum wage workforce.
According to state officials, more than 60% of minimum wage workers in Connecticut are women or people of color, with women of color representing a large portion of this group.
“This is not just something for teenagers. This is not just an after school job,” said state labor commissioner Danté Bartolomeo. “This is how they support themselves and how they support their families, and when they’re not making a fair wage, they have to work more and have less quality of life, which leads to all kinds of other complications, stress and health and all of those kinds of things”
Still, the minimum wage increase has long been a source of political division, with state Democrats largely arguing that the increase is a necessary economic justice issue intended to address disparities and help narrow income gaps. State Republicans, meanwhile, have argued that the wage increases will stifle economic growth, harming small business owners who are unable to manage constantly increasing wages.
The minimum wage increase has also been criticized by groups like the Connecticut Business and Industry Association, which has argued that the annual rise will negatively affect businesses already dealing with economic uncertainty and rising expenses, potentially encouraging business owners to move to states with friendlier policies.

Lamont however, challenged those arguments. “Going back to 2019, a lot of folks said, ‘If you raise the minimum wage, it’s going to be a parade of horribles,” he said. “‘You’re going to shut down the economy. Unemployment is going to surge. The economy is going to drag to a halt.’” 
Pointing to the state’s recent GDP growth, which rose 4.6% in the second quarter of 2025 and an unemployment rate that continues to be below the national average, Lamont argued that those fears have not come to pass. 
“It’s just the opposite,” he said. “Paying people a decent wage is a show of respect for them.”
There’s still room for new legislation on the issue
Still, even with the state’s improved minimum wage, there is still some unfinished business on the topic. The state’s tipped minimum wage, which covers tipped workers like restaurant and hotel workers as well as a different tipped wage for bartenders, has remained at $6.38 and $8.23 respectively,  for several years.
While there have been efforts to increase those wages to match the indexed minimum wage, including through the growing national One Fair Wage movement, Connecticut has yet to eliminate the tipped minimum wage, with bills in 2023 and 2024 clearing committee but failing to come to the floor of either chamber for a vote.
The current tipped minimum wage has been supported by groups like the Connecticut Restaurant Association, which argues that the current wage structure, which allows for workers to make the tipped minimum wage and add their tips on top, works well for restaurants in the state and allows workers to make far more than the current indexed minimum wage.
Asked about state leaders’ support for changing the tipped minimum wage on Thursday, Bartolomeo noted that the issue is up to state lawmakers to address. “We’ll have to see what the Legislature feels about that this year,” she said.
And while minimum wage increases have helped some of the state’s lowest paid workers, officials acknowledged that the minimum wage is still not enough for one person to truly live on. According to the MIT Living Wage calculator, a “living wage”, defined as a wage that allows a person to meet all of their basic needs, is over $25 an hour for a single adult with no children.
Lamont noted that helping people address those needs, as well as decreasing the state’s rising costs of living remain a priority for his administration. Still, he argued that the new minimum wage is a sign of progress. 
“When we came into office in 2019, this state and this country had been waging what they call a”Fight for $15″—a $15 minimum wage—for many years,” he said. “Connecticut won that fight.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_2812-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-08 16:59:19.823122

(Photo by Getty Images)The Wabanaki Nations will now have exclusive rights to operate internet gaming in Maine.
Gov. Janet Mills announced Thursday that she would allow legislation passed by both chambers last session to become law, despite her administration’s initial opposition to the proposal. 
Mills met with the elected chiefs of Mi’kmaq Nation, Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, Penobscot Nation and Passamaquoddy Tribes at Indian Township and Sipayik this fall, “who each spoke passionately about the importance of this bill in offering life-changing revenue for Tribal communities, as well as providing a form of economic sovereignty for their Nations,” she said in a statement.
She said while she has concerns about the impact of gambling on public health, she believes online gambling should be regulated, “and I am confident that Maine’s Gambling Control Unit will develop responsible rules and standards to hold providers of this new form of gambling accountable while ensuring that Maine’s tribes benefit from its operations.”
The Wabanaki chiefs applauded the law in statements provided by the governor’s office, thanking Mills and underscoring the economic boon it would provide to their Tribes as well as neighboring rural communities.
Wabanaki leaders reflect on gains as Legislature poised to revisit sovereignty proposals

Penobscot Chief Kirk Francis applauded Mills for working with the Tribes on this issue. “This cooperative approach and open-mindedness have led to passage of a historic Tribal economic bill that will benefit not just the Wabanaki people but all of Maine,” Francis said. “It represents a recognition of and support for economic Tribal self-governance and self-determination.” 
Mi’kmaq Chief Sheila McCormack said, “This bill will provide new and sustainable revenue that will deliver needed resources to invest in our community and provide for the health, welfare, and safety of our citizens.”
Clarissa Sabattis, chief of the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, called the new law “an incredible step for all of us.”
“For too long black-market websites have hosted illegal iGaming, with no protection for our youth and vulnerable adults,” Sabattis said. “LD 1164 will create a closely regulated iGaming market with strict controls and will ensure much needed revenues remain in Maine.”
The federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 codified that tribes have the exclusive right to regulate gaming on their lands, unless the state in which it operates prohibits such gaming under its criminal laws. 
However, the 1980 Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act has made it so the Wabanaki Nations are treated more akin to municipalities than independent nations, one way being that the Tribes are unable to benefit from any federal law passed after 1980, unless they are specifically mentioned in the law.
In 2022, the Maine Legislature amended the Settlement Act to permit Tribes to handle sports betting, so the new law would build off of that earlier expansion signed by Mills. 
In a nod to this history, McCormack said, “For almost 20 years, our Nation struggled to gain the ear of Maine’s governors, but under the leadership of Governor Mills, and her commitment to respectful and open communication, our jurisdiction has been reestablished.”
Mills has not supported every effort to expand sovereignty, opposing sweeping reforms in favor of taking a piecemeal approach to changing the Settlement Act. In June, the governor vetoed legislation that sought to prevent the state from being able to seize tribal land for public use. 
Nearly half of the candidates vying to replace Mills have pledged to back full sovereignty if they win the gubernatorial election in November.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/internet-gambling-2048x1363-4-1024x682.jpeg,,,2026-01-08 16:59:19.823122

Free.,Defiant Vance scolds reporters over descriptions of Minneapolis ICE shooting,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/defiant-vance-scolds-reporters-over-descriptions-minneapolis-ice-shooting,,"WASHINGTON — Vice President JD Vance said Thursday the Trump administration would stand by the federal immigration officer who shot and killed a woman in Minneapolis the day prior. Vance defended the immigration officer’s actions as “self-defense” and berated journalists for covering the story, including by reporting that on-the-scene videos contradicted claims from the Trump administration that 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good used her vehicle to harm the immigration officer who fired three shots into her windshield. “I would appreciate everybody saying a prayer for that agent,” Vance said. “I think the media prejudging and talking about this guy as if he's a murderer is one of the most disgraceful things I've ever seen from the American media.”An analysis from The New York Times of videos from three different angles show Good turning her SUV away from Ross and that he was not in the path of her vehicle when he fired three shots at close range into her windshield. The Minnesota Star Tribune identified the federal immigration officer as Jonathan Ross, who Vance said was hit by a vehicle during an immigration operation six months ago.“That ICE officer nearly had his life ended, dragged by a car six months ago, 33 stitches in his leg so you think maybe he's a little bit sensitive about somebody ramming him with an automobile,” Vance said. Vance also accused Good of impeding a law enforcement operation.“I'm not happy that this woman was there at a protest violating the law by interfering with the law enforcement action,” he said. “I think that we can all recognize that the best way to turn down the temperature is to tell people to take their concerns about immigration policy to the ballot box, stop assaulting and stop inciting violence against our law enforcement officers.”DHS operation to continueHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem also defended the immigration agent during a Thursday press conference.“This is an experienced officer who followed his training,” she said.The federal immigration operation in Minneapolis began last month but intensified this week after a right-wing influencer reported day care centers run by members of the Somali community as fraudulent. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during the briefing that the aggressive immigration enforcement in Minnesota would continue. “The Department of Homeland Security will continue to operate on the ground in Minnesota, not only to remove criminal illegal aliens, but also to continue conducting door-to-door investigations of the rampant fraud that has taken place in the state under the failed and corrupt leadership of Democrat Gov. Tim Walz,” Leavitt said. ‘Absolute immunity’The FBI has refused to allow the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension from the investigation to have access to evidence or other case materials in order to investigate the shooting.  When reporters in the White House briefing room pressed Vance on why the FBI is refusing to cooperate with local law enforcement officials, Vance said it was a federal issue.“The idea that Tim Walz and a bunch of radicals in Minneapolis are going to go after and make this guy's life miserable because he was doing the job that he was asked to do is preposterous,” Vance said. “The unprecedented thing is the idea that a local official can actually prosecute a federal official with absolute immunity.”A federal officer can be prosecuted by local and state authorities if a federal official violates state criminal laws. Absolute immunity is applied to civil liability, and extended to certain positions such as the president, judges and legislatures acting in their official duty.

Jonathan Steinberg, the Democratic co-chair of the General Assembly’s Energy and Technology Committee, will not seek a ninth term.","Rep. Jonathan Steinberg, the Democratic co-chair of the General Assembly’s Energy and Technology Committee, said Thursday he will not seek a ninth term representing the 136th House District of Westport. 
Steinberg, 69, who said he has held the seat longer than any predecessor, had shared his plans months ago with political allies in Westport, a reliably Democratic shoreline community in Fairfield County.
“I have, up till at this moment, been able to avoid it being broadcast across the globe,” he said.
The moment no longer could be avoided once Matthew Mandell, 65, the executive director of the Westport-Wilton Chamber of Commerce and a member of Westport’s representative town meeting, registered as a candidate for the seat.
“He knew this was my last term, like year ago. So it’s not exactly news. There was, like, a 1% chance that there would become a reason for me to run again,” Steinberg said.
Mandell registered as a candidate Wednesday.
The committee Steinberg leads has become a battleground in recent years over the state’s aggressive regulatory posture towards Eversource and Avangrid and the utilities’ animosity towards Marissa P. Gillett during her tenure as the top regulator.
Gillett resigned in September as chair of the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority amid industry and some legislative complaints over her transparency, veracity and leadership style.
One issue was what role she had in producing an opinion piece harshly critical of the utilities that was published by the Connecticut Mirror under the bylines of Steinberg and his co-chair, Sen. Norm Needleman, D-Essex.
Gillett later admitted deleting an exchange of text messages with Steinberg, though both maintained that she did not help write the piece. Needleman and Steinberg both were defenders of Gillett.
Steinberg said Thursday the controversity played no role in his decision to retire after his current two-year term ends in January 2027.
“It’s been a long time. It’ll be 16 years when this year’s done. I think I’ve had a good run between,” Steinberg said. “My wife retired in October. She’s happily retired at home. I’ll be 70 in a few weeks. Seems like the right time.”
Steinberg is no stranger to legislative controversies. He previously was the co-chair of the Public Health Committee as it drafted and eventually passed legislation repealing the religious exemption on school-age vaccinations.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025_0108_SR_SessionFirstDay_180-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-08 16:59:19.823122

Former wildlife officials warn Trump-appointed team they can’t haphazardly dispose of refuge land, though many support a review of the embattled national system.
The post Wyoming’s Coursey leads National Wildlife Refuge System audit that’s igniting sell-off worries appeared first on WyoFile .","A Wyoming mule deer advocate is leading a Trump administration review of the National Wildlife Refuge System as former agency officials worry the effort is being rushed and may lead to divesting of federal land owned by all Americans. 
Josh Coursey, a Donald Trump-appointed senior advisor to U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Director Brian Nesvik, will undertake a “programmatic comprehensive review” of the 573-unit refuge system, according to Nesvik’s Dec. 16 order. The review also will inventory five marine national monuments, 71 national fish hatcheries and more.
Coursey is the co-founder of Wyoming’s Muley Fanatic Foundation. WyoFile was unable to reach him for an interview before this story published. Nesvik is the former director of the Wyoming Game and Fish Department.

The review of hatcheries, marine monuments and 96 million acres of national refuge land — an area larger than Montana — is being rushed and may not account for the purposes for which various refuges were established, seven former career refuge system officials wrote to Nesvik in a Jan. 5 email obtained by WyoFile.
The retirees, who have hundreds of years of combined experience, warned Coursey that the Fish and Wildlife Service “does not have broad authority to dispose of lands” in the refuge system. 
“With certain limited exceptions, [refuge] lands can be disposed of only by act of Congress,” the retirees wrote. 
The seven retirees, who reached the upper echelon of the Fish and Wildlife Service, signed the email to Nesvik, Coursey and Dave Miko, the agency’s acting deputy director for operations. They include four former deputy directors: Marshall Jones, Gary Frazer, James Kurth and Greg Siekaniec. The other three signers are: retired National Wildlife Refuge System Chief Geoffrey Haskett, Division of Migratory Bird Management Chief Brad Bortner and Megan Durham, a former deputy assistant director of external affairs at Fish and Wildlife.

The ad-hoc group also appears worried that Nesvik’s order signals some refuges or hatcheries might be eliminated. Nesvik asked field managers to “look for refuges or hatcheries established for a purpose that no longer aligns with the [U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service] mission.”
Nesvik’s directive calls for “an initial summary of organizational change recommendations” due by Monday with final recommendations due Feb. 15. That’s a rushed timeline, the former officials contend. 
“Such a large and important analysis should certainly be given more time and resources to develop a thoughtful and useful product,” their email reads.
Nesvik responded immediately, according to Jones, one of the deputy directors who signed the email.
“Brian stays on top of his email,” Jones told WyoFile in a Wednesday telephone interview. “I’m very impressed.”
Nesvik wrote, “I appreciate you and the other co-signers’ efforts to provide your initial thoughts and offer your assistance in our review,” according to Jones, who didn’t share the email but read it to WyoFile.
Nesvik sent the email to Durham, one of the retirees.
“You can expect to hear from someone on the team in the coming weeks as we conduct this important work,” Nesvik wrote.
Room for improvement
The ad-hoc group of retirees supports the overall review.
“We think it’s a good idea,” Jones said. “I’m sure there’s always improvements that can be made.”
The National Wildlife Refuge Association’s president is also cautiously standing behind the Coursey-led assessment. 
“It is a good and necessary thing to understand the complexity of the situation,” President Desiree Sorenson-Groves told WyoFile. 
The audit comes on the heels of long-term declines in staffing and funding that have left the whole system “at risk,” with not a single refuge possessing the resources it requires, according to a recent U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service inventory. Since 2010, national wildlife refuges have hemorrhaged more than 30% of their employees, mainly as a result of losing funding, Sorenson-Groves said.
“Before the second Trump administration, the refuge system was already in a dire place,” she said.

Trump’s “Department of Government Efficiency” exacerbated the situation, further trimming staff at refuges and hatcheries in Wyoming and beyond. Last month, 20 Democratic U.S. senators wrote Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to “sound the alarm” on the service’s “staffing crisis.”
“A startling amount of staff and expertise needed to manage the refuge system and protect America’s wildlife have been lost due to the administration’s firings, early retirement programs, and other efforts to push staff out of FWS,” the senators wrote in a Dec. 18 letter. “We ask that you provide Congress with your plan to address FWS’s staffing crisis…”
Meanwhile, Sorenson-Groves is holding out hope that the audit now underway won’t result in recommendations that further whittle away at wildlife refuges, or proposals that would sell them off. 
“If that is the case, then we will deal with that,” she said. “You don’t just divest refuges, as they [the retirees] pointed out in that letter. There’s a process, most of them are public processes, and there would have to be a really good reason.”

Another underpinning to the retirees’ worries is the distinction between the refuge system and the Fish and Wildlife Service itself. That difference appears lost in Nesvik’s order.
“The refuge system has its own organic act that lays out the purposes of the system — the way the system should operate,” Jones said. “It’s not just a subsidiary part of the Fish and Wildlife Service.”
(Fish and Wildlife Service’s mission is “working with others to conserve, protect, and enhance fish, wildlife, plants, and their habitats for the continuing benefit of the American people,” according to the agency website.)
The retiree’s email to Nesvik states that federal laws establish specific purposes for individual refuges, “and any review should use these as a guideline, not the overall mission of the FWS.” Federal laws say refuge units should be managed for “the specific purposes for which each refuge was established,” the email says.
The Migratory Bird Treaty Act also obligates the U.S. to conserve cross-border avian migrants, the retirees stated. 
‘Things that concern me’
Jones wouldn’t characterize his former colleagues’ views about what’s been called Trump’s anti-environmental agenda, but he has worries.
“It’s not about the political party — it is about the mindset and what people think is important,” Jones said. “There are things that concern me about the current administration. The concerns are very significant now.”
Migratory birds are declining, and even mule deer are another species “in trouble,” Jones said. It’s “a fight” to educate people about the needs of wildlife and make sure those needs are taken into account amid development pressure and pollution that weighs on the natural world, he said.
“The worries don’t magically disappear, depending on what administration is in power in Washington D.C. or state capitols,” he said. “We are passionate advocates of the refuge system [and marine sanctuaries]. These areas are important to the American people for the long-term health of our country’s resources, and they make large financial contributions to the communities involved.”
According to Nesvik’s order, the National Wildlife Refuge System review is to be completed along with “a list of actionable recommendations” no later than Feb. 15. The agency is not soliciting comments from the general public, but it did establish a system so that refuge system staff could anonymously provide feedback. 
The National Wildlife Refuge Association will be weighing in too, using the same approach the retirees did — sending an email.  
“Josh [Coursey] and Dave [Miko], I know that they’re actually interested in hearing feedback,” Sorenson-Groves said. “I’m not jumping to any conclusions because I want to see where they go with this.”

(Screenshot from Zoom)A lawsuit that says the Trump administration violated Colorado’s state sovereignty has been updated to cite additional federal actions the state says are unconstitutional, according to Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser.
The Trump administration has “ramped up a widespread campaign of retribution to punish Colorado” in recent weeks, Weiser, a Democrat running for Colorado governor, said in a press call Thursday.
An October lawsuit says President Donald Trump’s decision to move U.S. Space Command from Colorado to Alabama is an unconstitutional violation of state sovereignty, since he said he based that decision on how Colorado runs its elections.

Trump’s moves to terminate transportation funding for Colorado, close the National Center for Atmospheric Research, require updated eligibility interviews for people receiving federal food assistance, and deny Federal Emergency Management Agency relief for areas affected by wildfires and flooding also violate state sovereignty, the amended lawsuit says.
“This series of events and the timing, demonstrate and reflect an unmistakable campaign of punishment and threats directed at Colorado to respond to what is the lawful exercise of our sovereign authority,” Weiser said. “And sadly, indications are more might be coming.”
Trump has targeted Colorado because of its use of mail ballots in its elections and because the state has refused to release Tina Peters, the former Republican Mesa County clerk serving a nine-year sentence in state prison for her role in a breach of her office’s election systems, according to Weiser. The president threatened “harsh measures” if she isn’t released. 










This series of events and the timing, demonstrate and reflect an unmistakable campaign of punishment and threats directed at Colorado to respond to what is the lawful exercise of our sovereign authority.


– Phil Weiser, Colorado attorney general


“Our Constitution’s clear. States have the power to manage elections and administer our criminal justice systems,” Weiser said. “No administration has sought to take away this power and to try to force states to bend to its will.  This administration cannot be allowed to do so either.”
The amended lawsuit does not include the Trump administration’s recent move to block Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and child care funding, but Weiser said to “stay tuned,” indicating a separate lawsuit could be coming.
Weiser’s lawsuit asks the U.S. District Court of Colorado to declare Trump’s “vindictive” actions specifically targeting Colorado unconstitutional and to bar federal agencies from enforcing the actions. 
“I recognize this is a novel request, and that’s because this is an unprecedented administration. We’ve never seen an administration act in a way that is so flatly violating the Constitution and disrespecting state sovereign authority,” Weiser said. “We have to protect our authority, defend the principles we believe in. That’s why we’re going forward in court.”

,California,2026-01-08 21:40:00+00:00,CalMatters,"Newsom touts his successes, swipes at Trump in final State of the State speech",Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2026/01/newsom-successes-swipes-state-speech/,Newsom denounced Trump's cutbacks in federal child care funds and his refusal to send relief funds after the wildfires in Los Angeles County.,"California’s constitution requires the governor to “report to the Legislature each calendar year on the condition of the state and may make recommendations.”
For the past seven years, Gavin Newsom has reluctantly and minimally honored that command, usually eschewing the traditional January address to a joint legislative session in the Capitol.
But today, entering the final year of his governorship, he delivered a 64-minute, no-script paean to legislators that catalogued his achievements and portrayed the state as a model for the world, while interspersing harsh criticism of President Donald Trump as an autocrat who is undermining democracy.
Thus it was not only a celebratory swan song but a platform of sorts for Newsom’s all-but-certain campaign to succeed Trump in 2028 — implying that a prosperous, inclusive and generous California could become a model for the nation should he occupy the White House.
Newsom only mentioned Trump by name twice, once while denouncing cutbacks in federal child care funds and near the end, excoriating his refusal to send billions of dollars in relief for the deadly wildfires that swept through Los Angeles County exactly a year ago.
Newsom termed it “a complete failure to act” and added, “It’s time for the president of the United States to act like the president of the United States.”
During the speech, Newsom also dropped a few hints about what he wants to happen during his final year as governor — particularly about putting the state’s finances in order. Ever since Newsom erroneously proclaimed in 2022 that the state had a $97.5 billion surplus and he and the Legislature ramped up spending, the budget has been plagued with multibillion-dollar deficits that have been papered over with accounting gimmicks, off-the-books loans and transfers from emergency reserves.
The Legislature’s budget advisor, Gabe Petek, has projected another $18 billion deficit for 2026-27, perhaps growing to $35 billion thereafter.
Newsom told legislators that his proposed budget, which will be unveiled Friday, anticipates an additional $42.3 billion in revenues, based on recent increases in tax payments. It will, he said, close the gap and provide money to restore reserves, pay down the state’s pension debt and finance increases in some programs, including a jump in education support.
Were the Legislature to embrace Newsom’s rosy fiscal scenario, it would allow him to end his governorship a year hence with a budget that, at least on paper, would be in the black.
However, recent history implies that Newsom’s projected revenue windfall should be viewed with skepticism. His Department of Finance quietly acknowledged later that his 2022 claim of a $97.5 billion surplus was based on a $165 billion overstatement of revenues over four years.
All in all, it was arguably the most cogent address that Newsom has delivered as governor, even if it ignored, downplayed or rationalized some of California’s most vexing issues, such as the nation’s highest rates of homelessness, unemployment, poverty and living costs, not to mention the budget deficit.
It was clearly aimed, Newsom suggested, at refuting a “California derangement syndrome” that sees the state as a hellhole of crime and squalor, with taxes and regulations that suffocate business and drive people to other states.
It’s a clever play on the “Trump derangement syndrome” that those on the political right often tout. Wordplay notwithstanding, if and when Newsom makes his presidential ambitions official his most daunting factor will be simply that he’s from California.
Reality lies somewhere between the exalted view of California that Newsom peddles, claiming “we simply have no peer,” and the dystopian image that dominates right wing media.

Elissa Slotkin (D-Holly) put forth a plan on Thursday to utilize the full force of the federal government to address the nation’s housing crisis, following up on a previous call to declare a national emergency on housing. 
“There is nothing more fundamental to the American Dream than owning your own home, and it has become increasingly difficult for middle class Americans to do this,” Slotkin said in a statement. “The United States is in a housing crisis, and we need to act now. That’s why my bill declares a national housing emergency, cuts regulations that get in the way and uses the full weight of the U.S. government to increase our housing supply by 4 million homes.”
To meet that goal, Slotkin’s National Housing Emergency Act would instruct domestic industries to boost production of lumber, steel, and manufactured housing to speed up construction and rehabilitation.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The bill sets a minimum residential code standard to ensure the emergency declaration does not support the proliferation of poor-quality housing. It also includes a “pro-growth requirement” for communities seeking federal block grants from the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Department of Transportation. 
Additionally, the act pushes states and localities to cut red tape by compelling them to change laws to allow commercial properties to be turned into housing, eliminate single-family zoning and allow for accessory dwelling units, sometimes referred to as “in-law suites” or “granny flats.”
It also bars states and localities from passing laws, rules or regulations that would impair the build out or rehab of housing during the emergency, which is set to end when either 4 million units of housing are built or rehabilitated, or in October 2031.
The bill does not currently have bipartisan support, making it unlikely to gain ground in the GOP-controlled U.S. Senate.

(File photo provided by Clemson University)COLUMBIA — A Clemson University professor fired over a Facebook post about Charlie Kirk’s death will get paid through the end of the semester, though he can’t return to any classroom at the college, according to a legal settlement.
Joshua Bregy, an assistant professor in the Department of Environmental Engineering and Earth Sciences, sued the university in October, about a month after getting fired. A lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union argued Bregy’s firing violated his First Amendment right to free speech.

PUBLIC Bregy Mediated Settlement 260103 
Along with dropping his lawsuit, Bregy agreed to resign effective May 15, the end of his original contract. Until then, the university will continue to pay him and supply benefits, according to the agreement. During the 2024-2025 school year, Bregy made $91,190, according to Clemson’s salary database.
Bregy, who has worked at Clemson since January 2023, can’t teach, conduct research or interact with students this semester. If he applies for grants, he can list Clemson as his place of employment, and university leadership will give him positive recommendations as he searches for another job, according to the settlement.
“We were honored to represent Dr. Bregy and to reach an agreement that restores his employment, allows him to continue to pursue research funding, and deters the university from violating the First Amendment rights of its faculty in the future,” ACLU attorney Allen Chaney said in a statement. “Politicians and university administrators come and go, but years from now we will still be here. So will the U.S. Constitution.”
In a statement, Clemson spokesman Joe Galbraith confirmed that Bregy will not work in a classroom or with students this semester and noted that both sides of the lawsuit must follow through on their ends of the agreement to make it official.
Another professor and a faculty member were also fired over social media posts criticizing Kirk, a conservative activist, in the days after a gunman fatally shot him in the neck as he debated students during an outdoor event at a Utah university. The other two employees have not sued.
Bregy did not write the Facebook post that lost him his job. The post that Bregy shared but later deleted condemned violence while also pointing to a comment Kirk made about gun violence, calling it “worth it to have the cost of, unfortunately, some gun deaths every single year” to maintain constitutional gun rights.
“I’ll never advocate for violence in any form, but it sounds to me like karma is sometimes swift and ironic,” read the Facebook post, included in full in the lawsuit. “As Kirk said, ‘play certain games, win certain prizes.’”
The Clemson College Republicans shared the Facebook post on X, formerly Twitter, alongside other photographs of Bregy holding signs saying Black Lives Matter and climate change was real. From there, the post gained traction, including among state and federal legislators, who called for Bregy’s firing.
The university initially put out a statement saying it disagreed with the sentiments but recognized faculty members’ rights to free speech under the First Amendment, prompting outcry from some who didn’t consider that enough. Republican legislators from both Statehouse chambers, including the lead budget writers, called on the Clemson Board of Trustees to “take immediate and appropriate action,” without clarifying what that meant.
The board suspended Bregy and the other professor on Sept. 15, five days after the Facebook post. Bregy received a letter of termination the next day, saying he “did not show due restraint or respect” and did not clarify that his views did not represent those of Clemson, according to the lawsuit.
Bregy’s firing was part of a nationwide wave of people losing their jobs because of posts criticizing Kirk or celebrating his death.
Some, like Bregy, reached settlements with their former employers, winning back their jobs. Most recently, a tenured professor at Austin Peay State University in Tennessee who was briefly fired because of a post about Kirk received a $500,000 settlement, as well as his job back.

,CommonWealth Beacon,2026-01-08 21:20:28+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,Healey unveils $250 million health insurance relief plan,Alison Kuznitz | State House News Service,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/health-care/healey-unveils-250-million-health-insurance-relief-plan/,"Federal enhanced premium tax credits expired at the end of December, creating turmoil for residents whose subsidies had protected them from steep premium hikes.","THE STATE PLANS to pump an additional $250 million into heavily subsidized insurance offered through the Massachusetts Health Connector, in an attempt to staunch skyrocketing costs for middle-class Bay Staters, Gov. Maura Healey’s office announced Thursday.
Federal enhanced premium tax credits expired at the end of December, creating turmoil for residents whose subsidies had protected them from steep premium hikes. Healey’s relief plan brings ConnectorCare funding to a total of $600 million, which the governor’s office called the “largest state investment in the country.”
The extra state aid is intended to ensure that about 270,000 residents enrolled in ConnectorCare and making below 400 percent of the federal poverty level “will see little to no premium increases because of the expiring federal credits, while also lowering other out-of-pocket costs like co-pays and deductibles,” Healey’s office said. That threshold applies to individuals earning up to $62,600 and families of four earning up to $128,600.
“This continued commitment means hundreds of thousands of Massachusetts residents can continue to afford coverage that’s there for them when they need it, keeping them healthy and financially secure,” Connector Executive Director Audrey Morse Gasteier said. “This commitment reinforces Massachusetts’s standing as the state with the most significant investment in affordable coverage through the Affordable Care Act Marketplace.”
While showcasing her plan for the state to step in, Healey on Thursday continued to call on the federal government to “extend these federal credits so that people can afford the health insurance that they need.” 
The $250 million will come from the Commonwealth Care Trust Fund, Healey’s office said. It’s not clear how much money is currently in that fund. 
State law says that money “credited to the fund shall be expended without further appropriation for programs administered by the commonwealth health insurance connector authority.”  The governor’s office described her proposal as a “plan” and said she had “directed the Health Connector to sustain this increased investment.” 
The fund receives money from employer contributions, transfers from the currently overburdened Health Safety Net Trust Fund, and revenue tied to penalties paid by residents who don’t meet the state’s health insurance mandate. Bay Staters must have insurance coverage that meets certain standards or face a penalty.
The infusion offers an “additional subsidy” for people enrolled in ConnectorCare plans designed for residents earning between 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level, Connector spokesperson Jason Lefferts said.
Healey said she directed the Connector to explore other populations that can benefit from heavily subsidized ConnectorCare. The Connector and MassHealth are also exploring other options to prevent coverage losses stemming from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which analysts warn could double the state’s uninsured rate.
To highlight the impact of the $250 million plan, Healey’s office used the example of a 45-year-old couple in Fall River who have two kids and make $75,000. They previously paid $166 monthly for the “lowest cost coverage,” though that figure would have more than doubled to $452 with the expiring subsidies. With the new ConnectorCare boost, the couple will now pay $206 monthly.
Under a federal policy change not linked to the expiring tax credits, residents with legal status who earned below 100 percent of the federal poverty level lost their eligibility for ConnectorCare on January 1. Healey’s plan does not restore this ConnectorCare plan type, Lefferts said.
Due to the expiring tax credits, the Health Connector has said subsidized coverage would not be available in 2026 for households earning between 400 percent and 500 percent of the federal poverty level. 
Open enrollment at the Health Connector wraps up on January 23. As of last week, nearly 23,000 Bay Staters had terminated their coverage through the Connector this cycle, and 23,596 people newly signed up for plans.
The Connector’s open enrollment dashboard notes that individuals who qualify for unsubsidized coverage in 2026 — either because of a loss of federal subsidies or they were already unsubsidized in 2025 — “are more likely to have canceled their 2026 coverage than other types of current enrollees.”
As of Jauary. 4, the Connector counted 368,436 enrollments — with 273,909 people signed up for ConnectorCare, according to the dashboard.

Updated 4:51 p.m.
MONTPELIER—Vermont school districts could see their spending capped beginning in 2028 if the Legislature passes a bill introduced Thursday by Senate Pro Tempore Phil Baruth, D/P-Chittenden Central.
The bill, S.220, is meant to contain the growing cost of public education in Vermont while lawmakers get back to work on the education reform that began last session.
“We have to take the moment in our hands and try to do something about this ed fund growing by leaps and bounds,” Baruth said in an interview Wednesday. “It’s just a situation where, with everybody acting in good intentions, it’s producing a nightmare for the budget.”

The legislation would limit the growth in each school district’s per pupil education spending in fiscal years 2028 and 2029.
Julia Richter, a principal fiscal analyst with the Legislative Joint Fiscal Office, said during a Senate Finance Committee meeting Thursday that if the bill was implemented in fiscal year 2027 — the budget year starting July 1 — the state would save an estimated $67 million. That projection is based on preliminary local school budget data, as school districts are actively crafting their budgets for the next school year. 
Under the language of the bill, the cap on a school district’s spending would be tied to district’s per student spending in the prior fiscal year.
“So, if you were a high spending district, you’d be able to spend less. If you’re a low spending district, you’d be able to spend more,” Baruth said in an interview Wednesday. “The idea is to try to reach equity.”
In Vermont, where school districts are granted wide latitude to set their budgets, the lowest spending districts sometimes spend half the amount per student that the highest spenders approve. 
Baruth’s bill was referred to the Senate Committee on Finance after its introduction on the Senate floor Thursday.
The legislation mirrors a similar concept proposed during the 2024 legislative session that would have created “allowable spending percentages,” specific annual growth rates each school district would have had to stay within during subsequent budget cycles.
Under that legislation, lower-spending districts would have been able to increase spending more than their higher-spending counterparts. But the legislation ultimately did not come to pass.
Baruth’s legislation comes as Republican Gov. Phil Scott said he plans on using about $75 million in excess revenue to dampen an expected 12% average property tax increase. That spike is driven in part by a projected $115 million increase in education spending next year.
“While it goes against the grain and doesn’t actually fix the problem we’re trying to solve, I’ll be asking you to provide some property tax relief with another band-aid,” Scott said on Wednesday during his State of the State address.
Even as similar property tax buy-downs have become common in recent years, average education property taxes have risen more than 40% across the state in the last five years, according to the Vermont Tax Department.
Baruth said he generally supports Scott’s use of General Fund dollars to buy down education costs, but said it must be contingent on efforts to cap school districts’ spending.
“I can follow him on that move,” he said, “as long as we have some kind of more immediate cost containment.”
Scott, for his part, “believes addressing spending is an important pillar of education transformation in addition to addressing quality and is encouraged by Senator Baruth introducing legislation to curb spending,” his press secretary, Amanda Wheeler, said in an email.
The legislation already has detractors. Darren Allen, communications director with the Vermont-National Education Association, the statewide teachers’ union, called the bill a “non-starter.”
“We have long opposed Montpelier-based spending caps, and we’re flummoxed, frankly, at the lack of imagination coming out of Montpelier right now,” Allen said.
Allen said lawmakers should scrap the property tax as the means to pay for education and instead institute an income tax “that ensures everybody pays their fair share.”
“We know this is popular, we know this will simplify and make the way we pay for schools more transparent,” he said.
House Speaker Jill Krowinski, D-Burlington, on Thursday said she had concerns about Baruth’s bill. She pointed out that the state already has a version of a spending cap via the excess spending threshold, which financially penalizes districts for spending above certain amounts.
“So the question is, is that not working the way that we intended it to?” she said. “Committees in past years have taken lots and lots of testimony on cap versus excess spending threshold.”
She also questioned what impact the cap would have on school programming.
“If we’re asking people to cut more, what does that mean for our kids?” she said. “And what programs are being slashed? So, there’s a lot of questions.”

(Photo courtesy of UWF)University of West Florida trustees have approved Manny Diaz to serve as its president, the second-to-last step before moving the former education commissioner from interim to permanent leader at the Pensacola institution. 
The board’s approval is subject to confirmation by the state Board of Governors, which is expected to take up a vote later this month. 
“We cannot have an attitude that we’re just a small, sleepy institution and that we’re just good enough. There’s always room for improvement in every organization and I think we’re poised and have the opportunity to do that. And my vision is we’re aggressively going to pursue that, and we’re aggressively going to brand this university, and there’s going to be substance behind it, it’s not just flashy branding. We know we have the substance on the campus,” Diaz told trustees during a board meeting Thursday in Pensacola.

Compared to former President Martha Saunders’ final contract, Diaz is making the same auto stipend of $14,000 and $36,000 more than Saunders’ $24,000 housing stipend. Saunders’ performance bonus, as measured by a percentage of base salary, was 4% higher. Her base salary, however, was $536,273 in her last year.

The former Hialeah state lawmaker is set to take home approximately $950,000 in his first year as president, including a $674,000 base salary, up to 16% performance bonus, or $107,840, $89,000 annually for a supplemental retirement benefit, and another approximately $75,000 for car, housing, and phone stipends.
The contract provides a retention incentive. After completing his third year, he would receive $375,000. After completing his fifth year, he would receive $150,000. Those timelines started when he began his interim role, July 14, so he’s already halfway through his first year for retention bonus calculation purposes.
Makeover
UWF has been subject of a conservative makeover. Last year and at the end of 2024, Gov. Ron DeSantis and the board of governors appointed several new members to the board of trustees. In May, President Martha Saunders resigned before her contract expired. DeSantis’ office, when asked by the Phoenix if the governor played a role in Saunders’ resignation, responded, “Buckle up, you’re going to see a lot of changes [at UWF] for the better.”
The new slate of trustees made headlines last legislative session. Those candidates, many politically connected, faced extensive questions from senators during confirmation hearings. Two of the eight resigned before being confirmed; another, the Senate rejected. He was Adam Kissel of West Virginia and the Heritage Foundation and has since been reappointed — again, subject to Senate confirmation.
One of the trustees, Ashley Ross, worked for Diaz when he was a state senator. She said during the meeting that their work together did not necessitate her recusal.
Last month, UWF trustees approved a statement of institutional neutrality. That declares, in part, “UWF facilitates freedom of academic inquiry and of expression on any subject, which may challenge prevailing social norms, public policies, and institutional practices; however, as an institution devoted to the intellectual pursuit and communication of truth, the university itself takes no official position on public controversies outside its regular activities so as not to undermine the freedom of thought and expression necessary for that Endeavor.”
“I think from Day One, I‘ve declared clearly that we are interested, and this board has declared by passing a statement of neutrality, that we want to spur intellectual debate and conversation in a civil manner, that we want to have perspectives and ideas that are different, but that we have it respectfully,” Diaz said Thursday, adding that he expects “that one voice doesn’t get to be louder than the other.”
Diaz also focused on the importance of the university connecting with military installations in the area, athletics, listening to student input, and investment in academic programs and student life.

Fundraising
With Diaz’s experience in the Legislature, he emphasized how relationships he built in Tallahassee will be useful for fundraising for the university. He served in the Florida House from 2012-2018 and the Florida Senate 2018-2022 before DeSantis appointed him education commissioner, a role he held from 2022 until 2025. 
Diaz said that, following his time in the Legislature, he no longer fears fundraising. “I have no problem asking for money.”
“We haven’t really even scratched the surface with corporate donors,” Diaz said, calling corporations “the next layer” in fundraising. 
Opposition
UWF trustees named Diaz the sole finalist. Had they not, Thursday’s meeting would’ve included a rotating interview of the finalists, with the board making a final vote. Thursday’s meeting outcome was to little surprise.
Faculty Senate President and university Trustee Heather Riddell read into the record a prewritten statement and voted no on the measure that made Diaz the president-elect.
“Faculty have expressed concerns to me about the process in detail in the past several weeks, as a part of the committee I have some as well,” Riddell said, going on the say that she is focused on the process and not on Diaz himself. 
“The hiring of the president should be public and transparent as a public institution, we are accountable to taxpayers and our community,” Riddell said, citing the BOG regulation that requires at least three finalists to be presented to the board of trustees unless there are “exceptional circumstances.”
“There doesn’t appear to be one,” Riddell said.
During public comment, Amy Cook, vice president of the Faculty Senate, made known her concerns about the search, too. 
“Based on standard practices, this appears to be a failed search. I have served on and/or chaired several academic searches. If the committee in any of those searches thought that only one candidate was qualified, the search would’ve been reopened and expanded. If the search truly produced only one worthy candidate to bring on campus, then this should be considered a failed search,” Cook said. “If, however, there were other worthy candidates, then the perception is that this search was predetermined or flawed.”
Cook called on the university to “reconvene the committee to bring additional candidates and to bring this search to a legal, valid, and transparent conclusion.”
“This statement is not about any one candidate’s qualifications, it is about failing to go through the proper process. Not only did this committee deny the final candidate their opportunity to prove his abilities, it also denied other candidates the right to show theirs,” Cook said.
In a news release following the meeting, the university insisted it had followed the laws and regulations governing presidential searches.
More
The contract provides 20 weeks of severance pay and it requires two-thirds of the trustees to agree to terminate the agreement. 
Diaz’s contract term is five years, starting Feb. 1 and running until Feb. 1, 2031.
“Five years flies by and we hit the ground running but we want to continue that momentum and energy. This is not about sitting back, I would say if the Cabinet members thought it was going fast, they better buckle up now, because we’re going to put it into hyper drive, so none of us may be sleeping,” Diaz said. 
Chair of the Board of Governors Alan Levine congratulated Diaz on social media.
“@PresMannyDiazJr earned this. He has done a great job as the interim president, and he had strong local support for this appointment,” Levine posted to X. “I look forward to supporting his appointment when it comes to the Board of Governors, and I hope my colleagues will as well.

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Most Rhode Islanders no longer think much about the signature fraud scandal that dominated news coverage during the 2023 1st Congressional District district special election.
Secretary of State Gregg Amore does. 
Amore is still on a mission to scrub the stain left by the criminal forgery of voters’ signatures — including dead residents — on Lt. Gov. Sabina Matos’ congressional nomination papers two years ago.
Matos, once considered the frontrunner in the 11-way Democratic primary, finished a distant fourth despite repeatedly proclaiming her innocence. Two contractors hired to help collect signatures for Matos’ campaign were charged with multiple criminal felonies for the forgeries.
“When the Congressional District 1 signature scandal occurred, we heard many people say we should be asking for IDs when they are collecting signatures,” Amore told the Rhode Island Board of Elections during its Tuesday meeting. “No one is going to give their ID to someone knocking on their door. But we know people are willing to give their IDs through our secure portal.”
The Rhode Island Department of State’s online voter registration system, which debuted in 2016, requires residents to share some form of personal identification — typically a driver’s license or the last four digits of their Social Security number — to register or change their voter information. Since 2023, voters have used the same system, with the same identity requirements, to apply for mail ballots.
So why not extend that technology to the signature collection process required for local, state and federal candidates to appear on the ballot? Amore pitched his first-in-the-nation online nomination paper portal to lawmakers during the 2025 legislative session. The bill passed by a decisive 53-16 margin in the House, but failed to advance out of committee in the Senate amid time constraints and questions.
Amore, a former state senator, hopes getting an early start this year will persuade his former colleagues on the merits of technological advancement. He also sought support from the Rhode Island Board of Elections at its first meeting of the year.
“This is a really good and secure way to make sure the signature is accurate,” he said in an interview with Rhode Island Current. “This way, this person is who they say they are, they live in the right district, and are alive.”










This is a really good and secure way to make sure the signature is accurate. This way, this person is who they say they are, they live in the right district, and are alive.

Other states and cities temporarily allowed online signature submissions for nomination papers during the pandemic lockdowns that complicated the 2020 elections. Arizona and New Mexico developed separate websites or mobile applications for permanent e-signature use, separate from existing voter registration databases.
The electronic portal would supplement — not supplant— physical pen and ink signature collections.

Expanding access 
Amore saw the benefit of increasing access for voting groups often left behind: people with disabilities, who might struggle to answer the door when a candidate comes knocking, along with military and overseas voters.
Candidates are likely to have an easier time meeting the minimum signature requirements to gain ballot placement: 1,000 verified signatures for U.S. senators and gubernatorial candidates, and 500 for U.S. representatives. State senators need to collect at least 100 signatures from district voters, while state representatives need 50. Municipal clerks or voting moderators must collect 10.
It would also ease pressure on local election administrators charged with sorting through and verifying thousands of paper scribbles collected by hundreds of candidates during the two-week nomination period, Amore said.
And it could help the state elections board settle questions over signatures flagged as potentially fraudulent — offering a more objective verification process than matching a hasty John Hancock with a second signature from the same voter in the state’s database.
“I love this,” Marcela Betancur, a state elections board member, said in response to Amore’s presentation Tuesday.










I love this. 


– Marcela Betancur, Rhode Island Board of Elections member


Betancur recalled her dismay at the board’s decision to reject roughly 200 signatures on candidates’ nomination papers in 2022 because the signatories did not live in the same district as the candidate.
“I almost cried sitting here,” Betancur said.
The elections board deferred making a recommendation on Amore’s draft legislation along with other election-related bills presented Tuesday. Also yet to formally signal its approval: the Rhode Island Town and City Clerks’ Association, which is slated to vote at the end of the month, Nick Lima, association chair, said in an interview Wednesday.
But Lima, who also works as elections director for the city of Cranston, expected local election clerks would be supportive.
“It makes common sense,” Lima said.

The race to verify
The two-week period, typically in July, when municipal elections teams are charged with verifying nomination signatures for local, state and federal candidates, is among the busiest and most stressful.
“We come in early, we stay late, we work through lunch,” Lima said of his four-person elections team in Cranston. “There could be over 10,000 signatures we’re looking at, on top of our regular work.”
While speed is essential, so is accuracy. Any signatures tossed, or accepted, by local elections administrators could later be challenged in front of the state elections board.
“We want to be able to stand behind our work, so we need the time to do it right,” Lima said. “It’s a bit of a sprint and a marathon combined in that whole two-week operation.”
Can Amore persuade state lawmakers? Concerns that electronic signatures collections might make it too easy for unserious candidates to get on the ballot were one reason why the Senate Committee on Judiciary failed to advance the legislation last year.
“I would think it would be harder to get 50 wet signatures than 50 electronic ones,” said John Marion, executive director of Common Cause Rhode Island. Common Cause supports the proposal anyway. 
Amore dismissed concerns over the ease of access to the ballot.
“There still has to be outreach,” he said. “If you just put this on Facebook, it’s not going to do much.”
Face to face 
Amore still envisions candidates going door to door or staking out shopping center parking lots to seek voters’ support. 
Sen. Matt LaMountain, a Warwick Democrat who sponsored the bill on Amore’s behalf in 2025, agreed face-to-face conversations with district voters were still important.
“I like going door-to-door,” LaMountain said in an interview Thursday. “It’s important for them to know who you are. And it’s good exercise.”
But rather than shoving a clipboard into their hands, expecting a signature on the spot, candidates could explain to voters how to go online at home, on their own time, and submit a signature.
Or, perhaps, bring an iPad along with them. Which presents its own potential security risks.
“If someone comes to your house with an iPad, please don’t put your personal identification information in there,” said Randy Jackvony, a state elections board member who also works in information technology. “There would need to be something that prevents that from happening.”
The draft legislation empowers the Secretary of State’s office to create additional rules and regulations governing the electronic signature submission process. One rule could address Jackvony’s concerns around security, Board of Elections Chairperson Jennie Johnson said.
Amore acknowledged the system is not risk-free. But the Department of State’s voter registration portal already undergoes regular and vigorous security reviews beyond what’s required by law, Amore said. 
The cost of the upgrade to the existing infrastructure is still undetermined, though Amore said it could be covered under federal funding for elections administration.
Legislation is expected to be introduced in both chambers of the Rhode Island General Assembly “very very soon,” said Rob Rock, deputy secretary of state. Sponsors have not been determined, though LaMountain said he’d be interested in backing the bill on Amore’s behalf again this year.
“Hopefully we’ll get it over the finish line this year,” LaMountain said. “It’s a good thing to lead the nation in.”
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi and Senate President Valarie Lawson remained noncommittal in separate responses, though Shekarchi noted its strong support in the House last year. 
If approved and signed into law, the change would take effect in January 2027, with plans to implement in the 2028 midterm elections.
David Folcarelli, a spokesperson for Matos, said in an email that she supports Amore’s efforts to improve election security and accessibility but declined to comment further.

(Micah Drew/Daily Montanan)The two groups that sought to enshrine nonpartisan court races are now united behind a single ballot initiative, CI-132, put forward by Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts.
The ballot initiative was one of two nearly identical constitutional initiatives launched to counter a push by Republican leadership, including Gov. Greg Gianforte, throughout the 2025 Legislature to make changes to the state’s judicial system, including allowing judges to run with partisan affiliation.
According to a Thursday press release, Montanans for Fair and Impartial Judges, the group started by Ted Dick and Pepper Peterson that sponsored CI-131, announced their endorsement of CI-132.
The consolidation “signals a united effort to protect Montana voters’ 90-year right to nonpartisan judicial elections,” Dick said in a press release. “Montanans for Fair and Impartial Judges believes Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts has a strong policy and the resources to ensure the initiative qualifies for the ballot, which is why we have chosen to formally endorse CI-132.”
Dick has formally requested to withdraw CI-131 with the Montana Secretary of State.
Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts is a coalition comprising multiple advocacy groups throughout the state including Montana Federation of Public Employees, Big Sky 55+, ACLU of Montana, Forward Montana, and Catalyst Montanan.
The group gained endorsements from retired Montana Supreme Court Justices Mike McGrath and Pat Cotter, and lists more than 1,000 individual supporters on its website.
The text of CI-132 proposes to amend Article VII of the state’s Constitution by adding “Section 12. Nonpartisan Judicial Elections. Judicial elections shall remain nonpartisan.”
“We know that Montanans want to protect their right to judicial elections free from the influence of political parties and politicians,” Caitie Butler, spokesperson for Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts, said in a statement. “We are proud to stand with those who have endorsed CI-131 and CI-132 and begin the work of qualifying this critical initiative for the November ballot.”
The process to get the ballot initiative before voters has already hit some bumps, including a brief legal challenge against Attorney General Austin Knudsen, whose office initially approved the ballot measure as legally sufficient, but rewrote the language of the proposed ballot statement, arguing it did not inform voters what “nonpartisan” meant.
Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts appealed to the Montana Supreme Court, which rejected the AG’s language with the majority saying it injected politics into a “straightforward proposition.”
Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts launched signature gathering efforts for CI-132 in December and will spend the next five months talking with voters across the state about the importance of nonpartisan judicial elections.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Old_Supco2-1024x717.jpg,,,2026-01-08 16:12:19.378623

Both votes were 248-177.Just before New Year’s, Trump vetoed two bills Congress passed without any recorded opposition in either chamber last year. They were the first vetoes of his second term.One bill would reduce interest payments that Coloradans in the Arkansas River Valley must pay for the construction of a water pipeline to Pueblo communities.The other would require the Interior Department to protect structures within Florida’s Osceola Camp from flooding.Trump said both would be too costly for federal taxpayers.Colorado members call for overrideThe House sponsor of the Colorado bill, Colorado Republican Lauren Boebert, urged her colleagues in a Thursday floor speech to override the veto.“Contrary to what the veto message states, my bill does not authorize any additional federal funding,” Boebert said Thursday. “It simply modifies the repayment terms for small, rural communities in my district, so they are able to afford their 35% cost-share of the project that they are statutorily obligated to repay.”The bill extends Obama-era repayment terms for the local cost-share of a project the federal government approved in 1962.The Dec. 29 White House veto message said the measure “would continue the failed policies of the past by forcing Federal taxpayers to bear even more of the massive costs of a local water project — a local water project that, as initially conceived, was supposed to be paid for by the localities using it.”Members claim political retributionRep. Joe Neguse, a Colorado Democrat, endorsed Boebert’s argument, but added stronger words opposing Trump’s veto.“This bill will cost taxpayers virtually nothing, as was referenced, and it makes good on a promise to the people of rural Colorado,” he said. “We are here because … the president has declared war on our state.”Neguse, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Florida Democrat, and House Natural Resources Committee ranking Democrat Jared Huffman of California all said the vetoes were part of political payback by the White House, though they did not offer additional context.“No one voted against this bill,” Wasserman Schultz said. “This bill is entirely non-controversial, and it is so narrowly focused that it makes absolutely no sense, other than the interest in vengeance that seems to have emanated in this result.”Trump avoids another rebukeThe mid-afternoon vote was poised to be Congress’ second rejection of Trump on Thursday, after five Senate Republicans joined Democrats to advance a measure to rein in the administration’s military activity in Venezuela. House Natural Resources Chairman Bruce Westerman, an Arkansas Republican, said he supported sustaining the veto because he trusted the administration.“I respect the administration’s views on this legislation and its commitment to fiscal responsibility,” Westerman said of the Colorado bill.

Filed Thursday in Franklin Circuit Court, Coleman’s lawsuit asks the court to bar Character Technologies “from future false, misleading, deceptive, and/or unfair acts or practices in relation to their creation, design, promotion, and distribution of Character.AI in the Commonwealth.”

Coleman accuses the company’s technology of encouraging “suicide, self-injury, isolation and psychological manipulation.” The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 988. 
The attorney general also says the artificial intelligence “exposes minors to sexual conduct and/or exploitation, violence, drug, substance, and/or alcohol use, and other grave harms.” 
Coleman says “tens of thousands” of Kentuckians “actively log on to Character.AI, including thousands under the age of 18.” 
“The United States must be a leader in the development of AI, but it can’t come at the expense of our kids’ lives,” Coleman said in a statement. “Too many children – including in Kentucky – have fallen prey to this manipulative technology. Our Office is going to hold these companies accountable before we lose one more loved one to this tragedy.”
The complaint asserts that the company’s chatbots have posed as mental health professionals and “are providing minors with mental health advice without any professional degree.” It also accuses the technology of inappropriate “discussion of sexually explicit content, pedophilia, suicide and self-harm, eating disorders, bullying/harassment and illegal drug use and substance and/or alcohol use.”
The Kentucky General Assembly, which gaveled in Tuesday for the 2026 legislative session, has expressed interest in regulating AI. The Kentucky Artificial Intelligence Task Force has met over the last two interim sessions to look at ways to protect minors and address concerns around data centers, among other issues. 
Recommendations to come out of the 2025 task force include: 

Acknowledge that AI technology may be harmful to minors and consider legislative policies for the protection of minors on social media platforms.
Acknowledge that AI may impact careers regulated by professional standards, and consider legislative policies in coordination with professional standards boards to discuss when and how AI should be used within their profession.
Consider legislative policies for data centers’ need for large amounts of water and power requiring more baseload power to ensure grid sufficiency, including consultation with the Public Service Commission.

(Photo courtesy of West Virginia Legislative Photography)West Virginia State Sen. Donna Boley, R-Pleasants, who is the longest continuously serving senator in state history, resigned from the Legislature on Thursday citing a need to focus more on her family and health, according to a news release from the state Senate.
Boley, who turned 90 years old in December, was first appointed to the state Senate in 1985 by former Gov. Arch Moore. She’s served continuously since then, winning every election she ran in for her seat.
In a resignation letter sent to Senate President Randy Smith on Thursday, Boley said she was stepping away with “a heavy, but grateful, heart.” Her resignation is effective immediately.
“It has been the honor of my life to represent Pleasants County and the Third Senatorial District for more than 40 years. I would not have been able to do that without the support of my constituents who chose to elect me 11 times,” Boley wrote in her resignation letter. “To all of you, the words ‘thank you’ are not enough. I will be forever grateful and proud to have been your voice in Charleston, and I enjoyed my time in service to you.”
Boley held numerous leadership positions during her decades in the Legislature. From 1991 to 1997, she served as the minority leader in the Senate when Democrats controlled the body. For two of those years — 1991 and 1992 — she was the lone Republican in the 34-member body. Those years, she worked as the minority chair for every single Senate committee.
Since 2015, she’s served as president pro tempore for the body. 
In statements Thursday, Smith said it was “hard to find the words to honor” Boley’s years of service, where she brought an “energy that few could ever match.”
“She stood as a strong conservative voice in the Senate, even when she was the only conservative voice. Her institutional knowledge and her ability to work with all people — no matter their politics — is an inspiration to us all,” Smith said. “She’s truly one of a kind. I’m blessed to not only call her my fellow Senator, but my friend. We will miss her every day, but I am so happy to know my friend Donna will be enjoying her retirement surrounded by her children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren she loves so much.”
During a call with reporters on Thursday, U.S. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., said she could not say “enough great things” about Boley, who was first appointed to the Legislature by Capito’s father. Capito called Boley a “great mentor” and a “strong woman” who served her constituents “honorably and bravely.”
“I think [Boley’s service] tells everybody, men and women, that a strong woman can do anything when she sets her mind to it, because that’s what Donna Boley did,” Capito said. “I hope that she is OK. I’m concerned about her and I certainly will follow up with her and her family, but I wish her good wishes, and thank her for the many, many years of service and the many conversations and fun times that we’ve had together.”
Gov. Patrick Morrisey commended Boley’s dedication to her constituents, calling it “unparalleled.”
“Through the decades, she earned the trust of West Virginians and served with integrity,” Morrisey said. “I thank Sen. Boley for her extraordinary service. West Virginia is stronger thanks to her contributions.”
As Boley represents a multi-county district — made up of Wood, Ritchie, Pleasants and Wirt counties — a committee will be formed by one man and one woman from each county, who will be responsible for submitting three names to Morrisey for people to fill the now-vacant seat. The committee has until Jan. 23 to submit those names and Morrisey will then have five days after they are submitted to choose a successor for Senate District 3.
The 2026 regular legislative session will begin on Jan. 14.

(Photo courtesy of U.S. Army National Guard/Sgt. Ian Doyle)COLUMBIA — Gov. Henry McMaster overstepped his bounds in sending National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., a Navy veteran and nonprofit watchdog agency claimed in a lawsuit filed in state court.
The lawsuit announced Thursday asks the state Supreme Court to reverse McMaster’s deployment last month of 300 troops to Washington and stop him from sending any more National Guard members to the capital or any other state under the initiative launched by President Donald Trump to combat what he called a “crime emergency.”
Soldiers left in early December for a 90-day deployment. It was the second time in six months that McMaster sent National Guard soldiers to the nation’s capital. Following a request from the Pentagon, a first cohort of 200 service members left for the capital in August and returned in September. Maj. Gen. Robin Stilwell is also named in the lawsuit. As adjutant general, he leads the state’s military force and reports to the governor.
A similar lawsuit filed in West Virginia regarding that state’s National Guard deployment was dismissed in November. A circuit court judge ruled Gov. Patrick Morrisey acted lawfully under West Virginia law.
McMaster’s office contends the South Carolina governor also has broad authority to deploy state National Guard troops.
Decades-old South Carolina law says the governor can do so to counteract “war, insurrection, rebellion, invasion, tumult, riot or a mob,” whenever a large violent group is working together to break state or U.S. laws, if there’s imminent threat of that happening, or in response to a public disaster.
The lawsuit, however, contends none of those situations is happening in Washington.
Instead, “Operation D.C. Safe and Beautiful,” as the president coined the deployment, has National Guard members acting as routine law enforcement officers, according to attorneys for the state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union and nonprofit Democracy Forward Foundation.

Complaint -- Final (1) 
South Carolina soldiers’ “primary mission is to provide critical support to law enforcement agencies, reinforcing safety and security for residents, workers, and visitors in the nation’s capital,” the adjutant general’s office said in a statement ahead of the December deployment. During the August deployment, troops patrolled transit stations, events and popular tourist destinations, the office said last month.
The capital city didn’t need the help, and the mayor didn’t ask for it, attorneys for the ACLU argue.
Total violent crime in Washington throughout 2024 fell 35% from the prior year, marking a 30-year low, the U.S. Department of Justice reported ahead of Trump’s inauguration.
Skye Perryman, president of Democracy Forward, accuses McMaster of using National Guard troops “as pawns in a harmful political gambit brought about by the President’s desire to militarize the nation’s cities.”
Sending South Carolina’s troops to another state means less help if a disaster happens at home, the lawsuit argues. That’s a problem for people like Navy veteran James Weninger, a plaintiff in the lawsuit and a resident of coastal Berkeley County, according to the lawsuit.
“South Carolina’s National Guardsmen should not be asked to undertake illegal deployments or be used to score political points by our government,” Weninger said in a statement.
SC sends 300 National Guard troops to DC in second deployment rotation

Trump asked governors to activate troops under what is known as a Title 32 agreement, which means the federal government pays for the costs of deployment, but the governor keeps control over the guardsmen.
In response to criticism last summer about sending the troops amid hurricane season, McMaster said he’d bring them back if a hurricane or other natural disaster threatened the state.
The guard also said the mission does not diminish its ability to respond to in-state emergencies. The National Guard in South Carolina includes about 9,200 Army National Guard and 1,300 Air National Guard members, according to the guard.
Brandon Charochak, McMaster’s spokesman, said South Carolina governors have “unambiguous authority to utilize and deploy the state’s National Guard to save and protect American lives, defend the homeland, and assist in enforcing the rule of law.
“To suggest otherwise demonstrates either a remarkable ignorance of constitutional and statutory law, or a terminal case of Trump Derangement Syndrome,” he said in a statement.
South Carolina’s troops joined around 1,500 more from nine other states, along with local National Guard members, to patrol Washington, D.C., starting last August.
Attorneys in the South Carolina case want to skip the lower courts entirely. The ACLU and Democracy Forward asked the state Supreme Court to take up the case directly, citing its public importance and immediacy. Attorneys also asked for a speedy hearing.

(Photo by Carmen Forman/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A popular pandemic-era subsidy program that has helped offset the cost of child care for families and providers will end in April, the Oklahoma Department of Human Services announced.  
The state agency said the COVID-era program, which provides a $5 per child, per day subsidy to child care providers, will end April 6. 
“This temporary enhancement was funded through time-limited federal pandemic resources that are no longer available,”a DHS spokesperson said in a statement. “Sharing this update now is meant to give families and providers time to plan ahead.”
The Licensed Child Care Association of Oklahoma, which represents providers, said in a statement that the industry relies on these subsidies and that the cuts “will directly impact families and the availability of child care statewide.”
A spokesperson said in a statement that providers rely on the $5 subsidy to cover “rising wages, utilities, food and insurance.” 
“These changes return child care funding to pre-COVID levels, despite the fact that operating costs are dramatically higher than they were before the pandemic,” the spokesperson said. “Providers are already operating on razor-thin margins, and many say these cuts will force closures, reduce enrollment, or push families out of care entirely.”
The announcement that the program will end entirely comes after DHS last year said that one-time federal relief funding had been exhausted, and that the agency could no longer afford to fund the full program. New applications and renewals for many school-age children ended Nov. 1. 
The Licensed Child Care Association in December sued DHS in Oklahoma County District Court, seeking an emergency injunction that would require the agency to continue to pay the $5 per day subsidy for school-age children. A judge declined to immediately order DHS to fully restore the pandemic-era subsidy program, but litigation in the case continues. 
DHS said this week that the receipt of partial federal funding will allow it to resume paying the subsidies for children ages 6 to 8 until the program ends in April, but the pause on the subsidy remains in place for children 9 and up. Exceptions remain for children in foster care, adoptions, children with disabilities, experiencing homelessness or whose families are receiving emergency financial assistance through Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, according to the news release. 
In July, further changes will be made to subsidy eligibility for Oklahoma families. Income eligibility will be 55% of the state median income, down from 85%. This is a return to pre-pandemic guidelines, according to the release. 
“Together, these updates help strengthen the child care subsidy program by expanding support where funding allows and making thoughtful adjustments over time,” a spokesperson for DHS said in a statement. “Our goal is a more stable, predictable program that families and providers can rely on today and in the years ahead.”
Child care providers have expressed concern that losing these subsidies will cause facilities to close, which could harm rural communities where child care deserts are more prominent.

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderA Democratic Fulton County commissioner who blocked Republican election board nominees in defiance of a judge’s order is running to become Georgia’s next secretary of state.
Commissioner Dana Barrett announced her candidacy Thursday. Georgia’s secretary of state has a number of duties, including overseeing elections and granting business licenses.
Barrett won her seat representing the Buckhead, Sandy Springs and Midtown areas in 2022 after defeating a longtime Republican incumbent. Prior to her election, she worked as a tech executive, radio host and small business owner.
In August, Barrett and another commissioner defied a judge’s order and refused to approve two Republican nominees to the county election board that the Democratic commissioners called extremists and election deniers. A judge levied a daily $10,000 fine against the board of commissioners, but the fines are on hold while an appeal is being considered.
Speaking at an Atlanta independent bookstore Thursday, Barrett characterized herself as the best candidate to stand up against the Trump administration.
“This past summer, I was threatened with jail time when I said no to the MAGA extremists trying to stack the board with election deniers,” she said. “We’ve stopped them for now, but the fight is not over. I said then that I cannot and I will not hand our elections over to extremists and election deniers who think that their voices are more important than yours.”
The Georgia secretary of state’s office entered the spotlight after the 2020 election when  Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, refused President Donald Trump’s request to “find” enough missing votes to overturn his loss in the state.
Barrett characterized that refusal as “the bare minimum” and criticized Raffensperger’s support for Georgia’s 2021 election overhaul.
She said her experience as a businesswoman has prepared her to serve small business owners and her tech background will help her protect Georgia’s election system from cyber threats and protect Georgians from scams.
Raffenspreger is running for Georgia governor this year, and the lack of an incumbent has attracted a number of candidates from both parties who have also declared plans to replace Raffensperger.
In the Democratic primary in May, Barrett is set to square off against rivals including former TV judge and Biden administration official Penny Brown Reynolds and voting rights advocate Adrian Consonery Jr. The winner will return to face the victor in the Republican primary in November.
On the GOP side, state Rep. Tim Fleming; former state Rep. Vernon Jones, Kelvin King, a businessman and husband to state election board member Janelle King, as well as former state election official Gabriel Sterling, a top Raffensperger aide, have all announced their candidacies.

Ole Miss avenged that loss a week ago in the Sugar Bowl.
Rick Cleveland
Frankly, I thought the Fiesta Bowl betting line would be the other way around with the Rebels a slight favorite over the Hurricanes.
Of course, the oddsmakers set the betting line in an attempt to attract equal money bet on both teams – not because they believe Miami is 3.5 points better than Ole Miss. Georgia, by the way, was a 6.5 point pick over Ole Miss last week. Miami was an underdog in both of its playoff games. Underdogs have won four of six playoff games thus far. Power conference underdogs are a perfect 4-0.
There is a recency bias at work here with the Miami-Ole Miss betting line. Miami is a white-hot football team, having closed the regular season with four consecutive convincing victories, followed by two impressive playoffs victories. The Hurricanes won at Texas A&M in the opening round slugfest and then stunned defending national champ and second-ranked Ohio State 24-14 in the Cotton Bowl. That was the biggest upset in playoff history with Miami a 9.5-point underdog.
Miami dominated Ohio State for most of the game, leading 14-0 at halftime. When Ohio State looked to be mounting a second half comeback, the Hurricanes just mauled the Buckeyes at the line of scrimmage offensively, much the way they had Texas A&M in the opening round. Color me surprised if the Hurricanes don’t try and do the same to Ole Miss. The Miami offensive line is as massive as it is effective. Miami running back Mark Fletcher is a 225-pound bruiser who pushes the pile and breaks tackles. He is a load.

This isn’t exactly breaking news here, but Ole Miss must first stop the run to have a chance to stop Miami. Accomplish that, and then the Rebels have to deal with quarterback Carson Beck’s passing. Beck, a multi-million dollar transfer portal acquisition, is a classic drop-back, pro-style passer who is quite accurate when he has a clean pocket. As with 99% of quarterbacks, Beck becomes much more average when he has defenders in his face.
And that was the case on Nov. 9, 2024, when Pete Golding’s Ole Miss defense sacked him five times in the Rebels’ 28-10 victory over Georgia. Beck was limited to 181 yards passing and zero touchdowns, and he threw one interception.
The Ole Miss defensive staff believes Beck has better weapons around him and a better line in front of him at Miami than he had last season at Georgia. Still, it can’t be over-emphasized that the Rebels’ first task is to stop Fletcher and the powerful Miami running game.
Now then, let’s look at the matchup when Ole Miss is on offense. Miami’s defensive front might be the nation’s best. Defensive ends Rueben Bain Jr. and Akheem Mesidor have been racing one another to get to the quarterback. The Hurricanes totaled seven sacks against A&M and then five against Ohio State. Miami leads the nation with 46 sacks on the season.
Contrast that with this: Trinidad Chambliss has not been sacked a single time in two playoffs games. Part of that is due to good protection, but much of it is due to this: Chasing Chambliss is one thing, catching him is another. On many of his drop backs against Georgia, he made like Houdini, escaping the rush when there did not seem an escape available.
You ask me, Chambliss is the X-factor in this game. He makes plays when no plays seem available. He will have to make some of those kinds of plays Thursday night for Ole Miss to advance to the national championship game.
But guess what: Chambliss has been doing it week, after week, after week. His consistency has been astounding, as his 21 passing touchdowns compared to just three pass interceptions attest. This will be his toughest task to date. The Miami defense ranks in the top 10 in every major statistical category. The Hurricanes can smother you.
Both teams are sound in the kicking game. Both have excellent placekicker, although give Ole Miss the edge in field goal range. Lucas Carneiro makes 50-yard-plus field goals look easy.
Kickoff is at 6:30 p.m. CST on ESPN.
A prediction: Ole Miss 34, Miami 31. Chambliss makes a game-changing play and Carneiro makes a game-winning kick.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/28184542/AP25332676333925.jpg,,,2026-01-08 15:57:53.711924

Andy Beshear told reporters the shooting of a woman by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in Minneapolis was “foreseeable,” “preventable” and “tragic.” 
The governor also called the Trump administration’s response to the shooting “grossly irresponsible,” when asked about the incident in a Thursday press conference.

Other Kentucky politicians, including U.S. Senate candidates, also reacted to reports of the shooting — either condemning the officer or criticizing the victim for not following orders from law enforcement. 
The Lantern’s sister outlet, the Minnesota Reformer, reported that an ICE officer fatally shot a 37-year-old woman, Renee Nicole Good, who was driving an SUV through her car window in south Minneapolis on Wednesday morning. She was later pronounced dead at a local hospital. 
A witness told Minnesota Public Radio that ICE agents gave conflicting instructions to Good, who was driving a maroon SUV, with one agent telling her to move out of the way. Video obtained by the Reformer shows an ICE officer demanding that Good get out of the vehicle. As the vehicle begins to pull away, an officer fires three shots through the windshield and driver-side window. The video shows no apparent harm to the officer, who walked away from the vehicle shortly after the shooting.
Beshear criticized the Trump administration on Thursday for “encouraging ICE to act aggressively across the nation” by celebrating raids via social media and videos. 
“I’ve never seen a government agency push a group of law enforcement to be as aggressive and use the words of aggressiveness that I have with what is being pushed out there on ICE,” Beshear said. 
Beshear said typically in shootings that involve officers “we say we need to make sure we get through this investigation because each one has to be investigated by law enforcement.” He criticized U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem for calling Good a “‘domestic terrorist’ without getting the results from law enforcement” and President Donald Trump for his false statements on social media, including that Good had “violently, willfully, and viciously” run over an ICE agent.“This is a U.S. citizen. That’s supposed to be her president,” Beshear said. 
The Reformer reported Thursday that the FBI ousted the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension from the investigation, according to the official leading the Minnesota agency. 
Beshear also had a message for ICE officers, saying that they “take oaths of office” and are “required to follow the law.” 
“I’d encourage them to do their job the right way,” he said. “They’re not a member of the military. They are a member of a form of law enforcement inside the United States.” 
The governor called Good’s death “tragic.” Good was a 37-year-old mother of three who had recently moved to Minnesota, the Associated Press reported. 
“We’ve got to go about this entirely different than we are right now,” Beshear said. “Yes, we need secure borders, but how we enforce our laws show our humanity or lack of it.” 
U.S. Senate candidates’ responses
Kentucky candidates for U.S. Senate also weighed in. 
On the Republican side, U.S. Rep. Andy Barr said on X that “ICE agents are enforcing America’s laws and delivering exactly what Kentuckians voted for: a secure border and the deportation of dangerous illegal criminals.” 
“Targeting ICE agents will never end well for anyone who tries,” he added. 
Lexington businessman Nate Morris said on X that he “saw an ICE agent acting in self defense after being attacked by a leftwing agitator.” 
“Leftist radicals do not get a free pass to assault officers, obstruct deportations, or ignore lawful orders just because they’re upset that our immigration laws are finally being enforced,” Morris said. 
Former Attorney General Daniel Cameron wrote on X that police officers “take on difficult and dangerous work every day. There was a time when this was universally understood and law enforcement universally respected.” 
“We must return to a standard where following lawful orders is viewed as a civic duty rather than an option. When we do, everyone is safer,” he said. 
On the Democratic side, Charles Booker, who previously worked in the Beshear administration, made a public call to “abolish and prosecute ICE” online. 
“This is ridiculous,” he said. 
Amy McGrath, former Marine fighter pilot, said on X it was “pretty clear” the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Noem had “been lying about this horrific killing from the start.” 
“DHS labeled the victim, a 37 year old mom, as a ‘domestic terrorist’ almost immediately after the incident! I mean, just think about that,” she said.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/img_7009-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-08 15:57:53.711924

The regents were set to meet at 3 p.m. Friday. They will now meet at 9 a.m. next Thursday. Thirty-one state lawmakers also sent a letter Thursday urging the regents to “tap the brakes” and delay the vote.
“We have an obligation to understand that at a higher level out of just good stewardship for taxpayers,” said State Sen. Brad von Gillern of the Elkhorn area, who led the letter.

The Thursday letter says the public and the Legislature have had “very limited visibility” to understand the full implications of the deal, which was made public less than a week ago. 
Von Gillern said NU is a creation of the state with a large portion of state funding. Yet, many senators don’t yet “clearly understand” the deal.
“Even some of us who have dug into it deeply don’t yet have a clear understanding of the potential impact to taxpayers,” said von Gillern, chair of the Legislature’s Revenue Committee.
Specifics of the deal
The deal would authorize NU President Jeffrey Gold to proceed with a plan to buy out Clarkson’s $500 million share of the NU-Clarkson Nebraska Medicine partnership. Another $300 million would be used to purchase Clarkson properties near the University of Nebraska Medical Center campus in midtown Omaha. Gold has described the deal as an “amicable separation and divorce,” and said it’s now up to deciding custody.

Nebraska Medicine is the hospital and clinical and medical services partner of UNMC. The Nebraska Medicine board opposes the transaction.
Related, Clarkson has pledged to give NU $200 million after the sale for the “Project Health” innovation project, and NU would also commit to operating Clarkson College for five years.
NU had no immediate comment on the lawmakers’ letter.
Joining von Gillern in the letter were State Sens. Bob Andersen, Beau Ballard, Eliot Bostar, Machaela Cavanaugh, John Cavanaugh, Stan Clouse, Wendy DeBoer, Barry DeKay, George Dungan, John Fredrickson, Dunixi Guereca, Bob Hallstrom, Rick Holdcroft, Megan Hunt, Teresa Ibach, Mike Jacobson, Margo Juarez, Kathleen Kauth, Loren Lippincott, Dan Lonowski, Terrell McKinney, Mike Moser, Dan Quick, Jane Raybould, Victor Rountree, Tony Sorrentino, Ashlei Spivey, Tanya Storer, Paul Strommen and Dave Wordekemper.
The vote is expected to occur now without Regent Elizabeth O’Connor, who faces a formal article of impeachment in the Legislature. The Omaha regent announced Dec. 30 she would resign after Friday.

Gov. Jim Pillen would appoint her temporary replacement. His office confirmed it was not yet in possession of a resignation letter by 1:45 p.m. Thursday. Pillen supports the Clarkson transaction and could make an appointment to cinch another vote.
Von Gillern said he’s not taking a long-term positive or negative position on the vote but said more time might be more prudent to flesh out the issue.
The State of Nebraska currently faces a projected $471 million shortfall this budget cycle. Lawmakers control the state’s purse strings.
Negotiation complications
Gold, speaking at a faculty, staff and student forum Tuesday at UNMC, said the deal has been in the works since a few days after he became president in July 2024. However, because of “extremely rigid” nondisclosure agreements, the discussion couldn’t be public until last week.
“There will not be a single dollar of state appropriation, tuition, et cetera, or research funding or indirect cost recovery that goes into doing this,” Gold said Tuesday.
Gold said there is “not contemplation” by regents to financially micromanage the new system, noting certain powers already exist today. Regents also don’t plan to micromanage clinical care.
Regents are barreling ahead partly because if they don’t, Gold said the “exclusivity of negotiations” with the regents would lapse, and Clarkson would likely begin negotiating with out-of-state entities to pursue the deal.

Gold and Pillen, a former regent of 10 years, have said that’s a bad deal for Nebraska. Gold said Clarkson is “hellbent” on moving forward.
“They did not present this as a multiple-choice question,” Gold said. “It wasn’t a discussion about what could we do to stabilize this and retain the dual membership organizational structure, but that it was an inevitability.”
Gold said “we need to put this to rest as quickly as we possibly can and move on,” in part for the health of relationships among NU, Clarkson and Nebraska Medicine.
Von Gillern said he understands the nondisclosure agreements but estimated the negotiations could be a “low risk.” He said he’s not taking a position on the vote, which he said could end up being the “best” or “worst” deal NU makes, “but we don’t know yet.”
The Thursday letter ends: “We would urge you to postpone action on the $800 million proposed transaction to ensure all viable alternatives have been considered and until all stakeholders understand the impact of the proposal for the state and these two great institutions.”

The proposal would reduce the bench from five justices to three. Ultimately, lawmakers did not take any action. 
The post Lawmakers met privately about shrinking Wyoming Supreme Court following abortion ruling appeared first on WyoFile .","Hours after the Wyoming Supreme Court published its long-awaited ruling on two abortion bans — striking them down on account of the state’s constitution — lawmakers held a closed-door meeting Tuesday to discuss next steps. Up for consideration, WyoFile has learned, was a dramatic change to the composition of the state’s highest court.
In Cheyenne, the Joint Appropriations Committee was gathered for the week to continue the budget hearings it began in December. It’s the committee’s responsibility to craft a budget bill ahead of next month’s legislative session. 
Tuesday afternoon, Rep. Abby Angelos, R-Gillette, requested an executive session — a private meeting that the public cannot watch. Another lawmaker offered an explanation. 
“And that executive session is to discuss the possible action … toward the judiciary in the budget,” House Appropriations Chairman John Bear, R-Gillette, said. 
Rep. Jeremy Haroldson, R-Wheatland, seconded the motion and a majority of the committee voted “aye.”
“Somebody be ready to throw a bean bag at anybody that comes in the door,” Bear said. 
Behind closed doors
The committee then privately discussed but did not take action on a proposal to reduce the Wyoming Supreme Court’s bench from five justices to three, multiple sources with direct knowledge of the meeting told WyoFile. 
Sources also told WyoFile the discussion was in direct response to some members’ disapproval of the high court’s ruling that Wyoming’s two abortion bans are unconstitutional.  
One of the bans was a first in the nation. Sponsored by Senate Appropriations Chairman Tim Salazar, R-Riverton, the 2023 law prohibited the use of pills for abortion. The second ban, sponsored by Rep. Rachel Rodriguez-Williams, a Cody Republican who now leads the Wyoming Freedom Caucus, prohibited abortion but included an exception for pregnancies that were the result of incest or sexual assault.

The state’s high court ruled 4-1 that the two laws conflict with the Wyoming Constitution, which protects individuals’ rights to make their own health care decisions. 
Many of the committee’s members, including Angelos, Bear and Haroldson, are allies and members of the Wyoming Freedom Caucus, a group of conservative Republican lawmakers that won control of the House in 2024. Last year, the caucus sharpened its critiques of the judiciary branch, alleging that the state’s process for selecting judges is shaped by “political insiders” and “left-wing institutional capture.”  
Upon Tuesday’s ruling, the caucus quickly took aim at the Wyoming Supreme Court, calling the ruling “a stain on the Wyoming judicial branch” in a statement. 
“After decades of liberal leadership in the governor’s office, the State Supreme Court has been filled with jurists who reject basic biology and human dignity,” the statement said. 
Lawmakers respond
WyoFile reached out to Angelos, Bear, Haroldson and Salazar about the decision to discuss behind closed doors whether to reduce the number of the state’s supreme court justices. It did not receive a response from Bear, Haroldson or Salazar before publication. 
When asked if she expected lawmakers to pursue cutting the high court’s bench and if she planned to support it, Rep. Angelos told WyoFile in an email that she “would never try to guess what 93 lawmakers choose to pursue.”
“They all represent vastly different people across the state and assuming my colleague’s intent would be akin to looking into a crystal ball,” she wrote. 
“However, outside of this issue there have been discussion over the last couple of years among several legislators who do not sit on this committee about judicial reform,” Angelos wrote. “This is a broad discussion that we as representatives are hearing frequently from constituents across the state.” 
As to why the discussion needed to take place in an executive session, Angelos pointed to state law. 
“As stated in Wyoming Open meeting laws, when we as a committee seek legal counsel executive session is permitted,” she wrote in an email. 
Lawmakers could, in theory, change the number of justices on the Wyoming Supreme Court. That decision would require approval in both the House and Senate — a tall order, particularly during a budget session when bills must clear an initial two-thirds vote. But among the lawmakers who discussed the idea are some of the more notable members of the Legislature, and the Freedom Caucus controls the lower chamber.
State law currently specifies that “the supreme court of Wyoming shall consist of five (5) justices,” while the Wyoming Constitution requires that the high court “consist of not less than three nor more than five justices as may be determined by the legislature.”
Out of step or on target?
While some lawmakers have suggested the judiciary is out of step with the public, polling suggests otherwise.
In 2024, the University of Wyoming surveyed residents ahead of that year’s general election. Among other things, it found that 41.5% of the state’s adults either strongly approve or approve of the way that Wyoming judges are handling their job. Another 45.1% neither approve nor disapprove, while 13.4% said they disapprove or strongly disapprove. 
The Wyoming Legislature, meanwhile, received a lower approval rating and a higher disapproval rating. 
More specifically, the survey found that 34.1% of the state’s adults either approve or strongly approve of the Wyoming Legislature’s handling of its job. Another 33.3% neither approve nor disapprove, while 32.7% said they disapprove or strongly disapprove. 
The same survey found a wide range of views on abortion restrictions among Wyomingites. About 31% approved of the kind of ban struck down by the high court, with another 10.5% supporting a total ban. Nearly 39% supported a woman always having the right to an abortion, with the remainder supporting abortion “after the need … has been clearly established.”
A spokesperson for the judiciary branch declined to comment. 
The 2026 budget session begins Feb. 9 in Cheyenne.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-08 20:25:34+00:00,CT Mirror,"Save the Sound, Brookfield move to block pipeline expansion approval",John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/08/iriquois-gas-pipeline-permit-block-deep/,Opponents filed a legal appeal to block CT Department of Energy and Environmental Protection from issuing a final permit to Iroquois Gas.,"Opponents of a proposed natural gas expansion project in the town of Brookfield filed a legal appeal on Wednesday to block the state’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection from issuing a final permit to the project’s developers, the Iroquois Gas Transmission System.
The move came in a lawsuit alleging procedural errors by DEEP regarding the type of hearing that was scheduled this week for opponents to raise concerns about the project. 
It was also part of a larger campaign to stop Iroquois from expanding its existing compressor station in Brookfield, which will in turn allow the company to push more gas through its 414-mile pipeline. In July, DEEP issued draft permits indicating its support for the project.
In response to that decision, the town of Brookfield and the environmental group Save the Sound requested that DEEP hold an adjudicatory hearing that would give both parties an opportunity to challenge the permits under Connecticut’s Environmental Protection Act. Chiefly, they presented concerns that the new gas-fired compressors would release large amounts of pollutants and greenhouse gases, worsening local air quality. 
While the agency did agree to hold an public informational hearing, DEEP rejected the request for a more robust adjudicatory hearing, citing issues with the town and Save the Sound’s applications. Without such a hearing, opponents argue, they will be left without means to appeal the agency’s final decision.
The public hearing is scheduled to take place virtually on Thursday evening, starting at 5 p.m. 
“An informational public hearing is still important, and we still encourage everyone with concerns to show up,” said Jessica Roberts, an attorney for Save the Sound. “That being said, it does not provide the same rights that an adjudicatory hearing provides.”
While the lawsuit remains pending, the plaintiffs filed a motion on Wednesday for an injunction that would temporarily halt DEEP’s review of the permits for the new compressors. The New Britain Superior Court judge overseeing the case, Matthew Budzik, had not ruled on the motion as of Thursday morning.
A DEEP spokesman declined to comment directly on the group’s request for an injunction this week.
Following Thursday’s hearing, the agency will continue to accept written comments regarding the permits for the compressor station until Jan. 15, according to the spokesman, Bill Flood. After that, he said the agency will review all comments and make a final decision on whether to issue or revise the permits.
The Iroquois Pipeline runs from upstate New York, across Connecticut and Long Island Sound before terminating in New York City. The proposed expansion, which involves upgrades to several compressor stations, would increase the capacity of the pipeline by 8.3%, or 125 million cubic feet a day. The project does not involve adding new sections of pipeline.
Ruth Parkins, a spokeswoman for Iroquois, said DEEP’s review of the the Brookfield compressor station is the last major permitting hurdle before work can get underway on the $272 million project. The project has already received the necessary permits from New York and federal regulators, she said. 
“We look forward to presenting the project at a public Informational Hearing that the DEEP has scheduled,” Parkins said in a statement. “This hearing, along with a public comment period that closes on January 15th,  concludes the many opportunities that the public has had to provide comment on the project over the years.”
The project has elicited intense local opposition in Brookfield — where the compressor station is located less than half a mile from a local middle school — as well as from environmental advocates who argue that the expansion of natural gas infrastructure conflicts with Connecticut’s long-term pledge to lower greenhouse gas emissions.
Daniel Myers, a member of a local community group opposing the project, accused DEEP of hiding behind “procedural nonsense” to avoid public scrutiny of its permits. If the agency does decide to approve the project, he said it should require Iroquois to use electric compressors and other equipment that release fewer gasses into the air. (Myers’ group is not a party to the lawsuit brought by Brookfield and Save the Sound.)
“Our air quality in Fairfield County is some of the worst in the eastern seaboard, and [DEEP] has an obligation to avoid making it worse,” Myers said. “They’re permitting a thing that only makes it worse.” 
In November, nine activists were arrested after staging a sit-down protest in Gov. Ned Lamont’s office, urging his administration to reject the permits for the project.
Lamont, while not weighing in directly on Iroquois’ proposal, has been generally supportive of expanding pipelines as a way of increasing the supply of natural gas flowing into New England and alleviating winter price spikes. The Iroquois pipeline is connected to another proposed project, the Constitution Pipeline, that would carry natural gas from Pennsylvania to upstate New York.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025_1117_SR_SunriseProtest_123-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-08 15:57:53.711924

Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., said Thursday she looks forward to an investigation into the shooting death of a Minnesota woman by an immigration enforcement agent this week.
Capito told West Virginia reporters Thursday morning she had seen video of a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer fatally shooting Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis. Good was shot through the window of her vehicle. Good, 37, has been described as a “legal observer” to the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in the city. 
“First of all, I think it’s tough being an ICE agent, it’s tough carrying out our immigration laws, particularly in communities where they were in Minnesota where there’s a large immigrant community and broad pushback and fomented sort of protest to them,” Capito said. “Any loss of life is a tragedy. I think we see from the video there’s questions as to how all this happened and why it happened. 
“I look forward to the investigation that I believe President Trump has called for,” Capito said. “And I think that we’ll find the answers here. So I think that it’s tough to watch. It’s tough to watch.”
Capito made the comments in response to a question from West Virginia MetroNews during a press briefing with West Virginia reporters Thursday morning. 
Capito and the rest of West Virginia’s congressional delegation all voted in support of the Big Beautiful Bill Act, which increased funding for anti-immigrant enforcement, detention and deportation to $170 billion over four years. Trump signed the bill into law July 4. 
The shooting and videos of it has sparked division between people like Minneapolis city officials who see Good as a victim and Trump administration officials who claim the officer was acting in self defense. Congressional Democrats have demanded an investigation into the shooting.

(U.S. Air Force photo by Airman 1st Class Dylan Maher)The Trump administration on Thursday announced Indiana as one of two new national drone test sites — a designation that could attract jobs and spending from the industry.
Sen. Todd Young, who spearheaded the effort to land the site, applauded the move.
“It means that we have the ability and the private companies and universities and military will have ability to fly drones in Indiana’s airspace, which in turn will lead to more research and development, military exercises, more commercial development of drones in the state of Indiana and ultimately more manufacturing of advanced drones in the state,” he told the Indiana Capital Chronicle.
“From an economic development standpoint, it burnishes our reputation … as a cutting-edge state for excellence and innovation,” he added.
Oklahoma was chosen as the second new site, according to the Federal Aviation Administration’s website.
“From delivering lifesaving medicine to surveying pipelines, drones are already reshaping industries and changing how people and products interact. It’s our job to make sure the United States safely leads the way with this exciting technology – not China,” U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a news release. “We’ve added these new test sites to help us gather critical data and test new systems so we can safely unleash innovation in our skies.”
Young and the entire Hoosier congressional delegation expressed support for a bid from the Indiana Economic Development Corp. and the Applied Research Institute as the FAA expands its Unmanned Aircraft System Test Site program.
The federal agency currently designates seven drone test sites in Alaska, New Mexico, Nevada, New York, North Dakota, Texas and Virginia.

Young said the site will also mean more training opportunities for the Indiana National Guard and other military who come here to train, plus spillover economic benefits to communities that host them — and, high-paying jobs for Hoosiers.
“This sort of work is high-tech, precise and the demand signal is very strong for these best-in-class drones right now,” the senator said. “But not so high-tech that regular Hoosiers who are high school graduates with a certificate from community college couldn’t land them.”
He said it will take about six months to establish the site’s boundaries. It will be a wide swath encompassing Purdue University and southern Indiana.
Universities and military assets were emphasized in Indiana’s application.
The December letter of support pointed to Purdue University, which lawmakers noted has “the first university-owned airport in the country, the largest indoor motion capture facility in the world, and a faculty dedicated to addressing the challenges of safely integrating UAS into the national airspace.”
Indiana’s congressional delegation unites behind FAA drone test site bid

Highlighted, too, was Indiana’s Technology Readiness and Experimentation initiative at Camp Atterbury, which in August “demonstrated the ability to neutralize a 49-drone swarm with a single electromagnetic pulse,” as well as testing space at the Muscatatuck Urban Training Center and counter-UAS work at Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane.
Young said he was not concerned that Indiana’s failed redistricting effort would stall federal benefits to the state.
“I just continued to look forward and do my work, having confidence that President (Donald) Trump and the administration would be professional in their selection process and I’m glad they have been,” he said.
Young first pushed the site designation when meeting when then-FAA administrator nominee Bryan Bedford in June.
State-level coordination is additionally part of the argument.
The letter referenced Gov. Mike Braun’s Oct. 29 executive order establishing a statewide drone task force.
The new “Indiana Initiative for Drone Dominance Task Force” will coordinate work across government, universities and private industry to support federal efforts to strengthen U.S. leadership in drone technology and airspace security. The task force must deliver a strategic plan and recommendations to the governor by July 31.
Young, who serves on the Senate Commerce Committee and has worked on drone policy at the federal level, helped Braun craft the executive order.

The two awards are part of $256 million in Education Innovation and Research grant funding announced by the U.S. Department of Education in December. More than 65% of the awards, totaling more than $167 million, will support projects in rural areas, according to a news release from the federal agency.
Arkansas receives $1 million grant to support high-impact tutoring

Ten of the 24 awards went to state education agencies, the largest number of such state-led literacy grants awarded. Arkansas was the only state receiving multiple awards, according to a news release from the state agency. 
“These federal investments affirm the work Arkansas has undertaken to build strong literacy foundations for every student,” Education Secretary Jacob Oliva said in the release. “Through the LEARNS Act and targeted statewide initiatives, we have focused on early literacy, high-quality instruction, and support for students who need it most. These grants allow us to expand and deepen that work, particularly in rural communities.”
The LEARNS Act is a 2023 law that made sweeping changes to the state’s K-12 education system. Efforts to support literacy-related elements of the law include high-impact tutoring grants, increased literacy tutoring support of up to $1,500 for K-3 students who need additional assistance, literacy coaches for struggling schools and a policy prohibiting students who don’t meet the state’s third-grade reading standard from being promoted to fourth grade.
One of the federal grants awarded to Arkansas, worth nearly $15 million, will be used to evaluate high-impact tutoring initiatives at rural schools. The project will be used in partnership with Air Reading, a California-based company that provides virtual tutoring, and include an independent evaluation by Stanford University. 
The second grant, worth nearly $10 million, will be used to study a program that teaches early literacy skills in partnership with the University of Florida Literacy Institute.

,DC,2026-01-08 20:10:47+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Maybe, just maybe, there’s not another shutdown looming at the end of January",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/maybe-just-maybe-theres-not-another-shutdown-looming-end-january,,"WASHINGTON — Republicans and Democrats in Congress are cautiously optimistic they can enact the remaining government funding bills before their deadline at the end of the month, avoiding another shutdown. The milestone would represent an accomplishment for the typically gridlocked Congress, though it comes months after lawmakers’ original October deadline and the longest shutdown in history that reverberated throughout the country.  Senate Appropriations Chairwoman Susan Collins, R-Maine, said recently negotiators are making “progress” toward agreement on the unresolved bills, which include funding for the departments of Defense, Health and Human Services and Homeland Security.Those three bills are the most complicated to resolve and this year will be no exception given President Donald Trump’s actions on immigration, deportation and military intervention in Venezuela. Washington Democratic Sen. Patty Murray, ranking member on the committee, was somewhat less optimistic than her colleague about the likelihood all of the bills become law. But she didn’t rule it out. “It's up to the Republican leadership,” Murray said. “We're working hard to get our end of it done.”House approves some spendingCongress approved three of the dozen annual spending bills in the package that ended the shutdown in November, providing funding for their own offices and operations; military construction projects; the Agriculture Department; and the Department of Veterans Affairs. The package provided stopgap spending for the remaining federal programs in the other nine bills. The House voted Thursday to approve the Energy-Water, Commerce-Justice-Science and Interior-Environment spending bills, sending them to the Senate, where Collins expects that chamber will take a procedural vote Monday. Collins said the remaining six unresolved bills will likely move through Congress in two separate packages — one funding financial services, homeland security, the State Department and foreign operations as well as one funding defense, education, health care, housing and transportation programs. If Congress finishes work on the full slate of bills, which will likely account for about $1.8 trillion in spending, it would mark the end of the first annual appropriations process of Trump’s second term in office.Minnesota ICE shooting jolts processThe biggest hurdle to completing work on all of the bills will be reaching consensus on funding for the Homeland Security Department, especially after an immigration agent shot and killed a woman in Minnesota. Collins said a day after the Jan. 7 incident that members of both political parties in both chambers continue to work on the bill and praised subcommittee Chairwoman Katie Britt of Alabama for “doing a really good job.”Connecticut Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy, ranking member on the subcommittee, however, said there must be “constraints” on how immigration agents are operating. Murphy said the sharp increase in hiring at Immigration and Customs Enforcement as well as Customs and Border Protection, spurred by billions in additional funding included in Republicans’ big, beautiful bill, “likely resulted in people being out there on our streets who don't have the necessary training.”“Now I'm not saying that's part of the story yesterday, but we know that they are not applying the same standards and the same training that they have in the past,” Murphy said. “There's a broader question about whether CBP is qualified to operate in the interior at all. From my understanding, CBP was part of that deployment yesterday that resulted in the murder of this young woman.""Murphy said he has a “handful of ideas” about how to address his and other Democrats' concerns about how the Trump administration has approached immigration enforcement, while acknowledging any final agreement will need Republican support to move through Congress. “I won't be asking for the moon. We're not going to fix all of these issues. And I'm not looking for comprehensive immigration reform at all,” Murphy said. “But some targeted improvements in the way that ICE and CBP are operating, I think, are going to be necessary.”Murphy said he believes there is time to work out a bipartisan solution on that spending bill before the Jan. 30 shutdown deadline. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said during a press conference that the leaders on the Appropriations Committee and the subcommittee are having an “important and serious discussion” about the funding bill after the shooting. Congress could pass a stopgap spending bill for programs within the Homeland Security Department, which includes the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to keep everything up and running for the rest of the fiscal year. The fall-back option can be used when consensus on a full-year bill isn’t possible. That type of funding bill, known as a continuing resolution, would keep DHS’ funding mostly flat and avoid the need for it to shut down after the current funding law expires at the end of the month. It would leave in place the types of policies that DHS has been operating under all year. Negotiations continueHouse Appropriations Committee ranking member Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., said Wednesday talks on the unsettled bills are “going well” and that she expects lawmakers to meet their Jan. 30 deadline.House Appropriations Chairman Tom Cole, R-Okla., said his “goal” is to approve the leftover bills before the end of the month, avoiding the need for Congress to use another stopgap measure to keep the government up and running or face a shutdown. While the groupings Collins outlined may seem random, Cole said appropriators spent a good bit of time contemplating how to package the remaining bills. “There was a lot of thought given to how to work these things together and what would maximize support on each side,” Cole said. “Obviously, those discussions were had not just amongst Republicans but our colleagues on the other side of the aisle and in the other chamber. So we think that's the best package to move forward.” Congress rarely approves the final versions of the government funding bills one-by-one and used to approve all 12 in one omnibus package, though Republican opposition to that has led to smaller “minibuses.”Cole said negotiations between Republicans and Democrats on final versions of the full-year spending bills are being undertaken by subcommittee leaders. “If you can solve these problems at the subcommittee level, you've got the most knowledgeable people, the people that care the most on both sides of the aisle,” Cole said. “The further up the food chain it goes — whether to my colleagues in the four corners (of the Appropriations Committee) or to leadership — the more political decisions come, and the less knowledgeable the people making the decision are about the topic.”Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin, the top Democrat on the Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations Subcommittee, said that “great progress” had been made so far toward final agreement on that bill.“I'm very hopeful and encouraged, given the work that's been done so far, that we can do that,” Baldwin said. Louisiana Republican Sen. John Kennedy cast doubt on his colleagues’ ability to reach consensus on the last six bills, saying it will be “difficult” to work out final agreements in the time left. “I wouldn't bet my house on it,” Kennedy said. “And if I were betting your house, it would be just a maybe.”Kennedy said he isn’t involved in the negotiations on those bills but expects negotiators are “fighting over something.” Kennedy is chairman of the Energy-Water Appropriations Subcommittee, which already completed work on its bill. Ariana Figueroa contributed to this report.",,,,2026-01-08 15:12:14.901300

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)The Alaska Court System is preparing to finalize new ethics guidelines that will determine whether state judges must opt out from hearing cases due to personal conflicts.
An extensive new ethics code, modeled on a national standard drafted by the American Bar Association, is open for public comment through Jan. 23. 
The changes, which stretch for dozens of dense, jargon-filled pages, prescribe things like what a judge can ethically do during an election, how to respond if someone’s life might be endangered by secrecy and even what happens if an attorney is drunk in the courtroom.
“The primary purpose in my mind … is so a judge can look at it to determine whether what the judge is thinking about doing or is being asked to do is ethical,” said former Alaska Chief Justice Daniel Winfree, a key member of the committee that has been working on the redraft since 2018.
That predates recent concerns over the ethical standards used by the U.S. Supreme Court, whose members have been accused of accepting excessive gifts from people with issues in front of the court.
Alaska’s existing code of ethics dates to 1998 and was based on a model released in 1990 by the American Bar Association.
The association released a new model code in 2007, but Alaska didn’t adopt it. In 2018, as the court system dealt with a rising number of Alaskans representing themselves in court, judges were struggling with what they could and couldn’t do to help, Winfree said.
He suggested adopting part of the new model code to help with the issue.
“And all of a sudden, it got morphed into, ‘Well, we haven’t looked at the entire (code) since the whole thing changed. And so, would you like to chair a committee?’”
Winfree’s been working on the new code since then, continuing even after his retirement from the Alaska Supreme Court in 2023.
“It took a lot longer than I would have expected,” he said.
The code was supposed to become effective in April, but Winfree and others in the court system wanted a longer public comment period. It’s now scheduled for October 2026, time enough to make changes and fix any issues raised through public comments, according to Winfree.
The code applies to members of the Alaska Supreme Court, district court judges and superior court judges, but not magistrates, who are covered by the Alaska Commission on Judicial Conduct.
Federal U.S. District Court Judge Joshua Kindred resigned from Alaska’s federal courts in 2024 after an investigation found significant misconduct. He was later disbarred by the Alaska Supreme Court.
Kindred was a federal judge, not a state one, but the new draft gives a nod to his misconduct.
As Winfree explained, the new code “makes clear that judges are supervisors and that they have other obligations as supervisors than just an obligation to not be a bad person.”
Winfree said that as public comments arrive, the drafting committee will examine each one to consider whether changes need to be made to the existing draft code. 
“Depending on how many comments there are, we’ll probably have a couple of meetings with the Supreme Court to go over each of these things, make final changes, and then go to print,” he said.
“It’s a huge project. We’ll be so happy when it’s done, I bet.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/DSC01376-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-08 15:12:14.901300

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas Senate Minority Leader Dinah Sykes will run for state insurance commissioner, vowing to decline any campaign contributions from the insurance industry.
Sykes, a Lenexa Democrat, announced her intention Thursday to challenge House Speaker Dan Hawkins, a previously uncontested Republican from Wichita with decades of experience in insurance.
She described a platform focused on lowering costs, consumer protection and holding “big insurance companies accountable.”
“It’s simple: The cost of health insurance in Kansas is simply out of control,” Sykes said in the announcement. “Families and consumers can’t afford to keep up with the rise in premiums — on health care, auto, property or any other kind of insurance for that matter.”
She said she will not “take a single dime from the insurance industry.”
Sykes was elected to the Senate in 2016 as a Republican, switching parties during her first term. She was elected minority leader in 2020 and has held the position since. Before her tenure in the Legislature, Sykes ran her own business as a personal chef and a PTA president. She is a mother to two boys and married.
Hawkins announced his candidacy in May, rooting it in conservative values and deregulating the state’s insurance marketplace, which he speculated could lower costs and make insurance easier to navigate.
The insurance commissioner oversees the Kansas Insurance Department, which regulates insurance companies operating in the state. The current commissioner, Vicki Schmidt, is running for the Republican nomination for governor.
Hawkins said in a statement he and Sykes have a good working relationship, and he welcomed a spirited campaign. But, he said, “we arrive at things from a very different perspective politically and quite frankly, fiscally.” He said his focus is on increasing competition, easing marketplace navigation issues and ensuring people are not wrongly denied coverage.
He liked Sykes’ policy focus to “Zohran Mamdani-like woke politics,” referencing the newly elected Democratic mayor of New York City.
Former insurance commissioner and Democratic Gov. Kathleen Sebelius and former insurance commissioner Sandy Praeger, a Republican, threw their support behind Sykes.
“As long as I’ve known Dinah, she’s stood up for what’s right and fought for Kansas families,” Sebelius said in the announcement.
Praeger said Sykes is a practical leader, focused on garnering results over partisanship.
“Kansans want leaders who will listen to them and fight against unfair and discriminatory practices by the industry,” she said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/PC022559-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-08 15:12:14.901300

Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham appointed Wilson to a vacant state Senate seat on Jan. 8, 2026. (Courtesy Chaves County Commission)New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham on Thursday appointed Rex Wilson, a former healthcare administrator and longtime rancher, to assume a vacant state Senate seat ahead of the upcoming legislative session.
Wilson will represent Senate District 33, following the resignation of Alamogordo Republican Nicholas Paul last fall due to health issues. Wilson will serve the remainder of the term until the Nov. 3, 2026 general election.
Because Senate District 33 covers part of Chaves, Lincoln and Otero counties, all three commissions met to consider and submit nominees to the governor. 
Wilson was one of three candidates county commissions put forward for the governor’s consideration.Chaves County’s commission nominated Wilson; Lincoln County commissioners nominated their commission chair, Mark Fischer; and Otero County picked current state Rep. John Block (R-Alamogordo).
Southeastern NM counties submit three names to fill vacant NM Senate seat

Wilson told Source New Mexico on Thursday that he is eager to get to work, namely on healthcare and agricultural issues, though he did not have any plans as of Thursday to introduce legislation or co-sponsor any particular bills. 
“I don’t come with a loaded agenda,” he said. “More than anything is, just get acquainted and build the right relationships in this session and make a difference.”
He also said he is eager to work with Republicans and Democrats in the majority, particularly on health care issues. “I’m a conservative, but also a realist,” he said. 
Wilson was the Southern region healthcare administrator at Presbyterian Medical Service until 2024 and touts 18 years of healthcare experience, according to a cover letter he presented to county commissions. He is also a multigenerational rancher in Lincoln County who was the New Mexico Cattle Growers’ Association Cattleman of the Year in 2017. 
Citing health, NM GOP senator resigns after less than a year in office

He also founded Camp Sierra Blanca at Fort Stanton, a “nationally recognized alternative education model” that gives troubled young people a “second chance through non-traditional pathways,” he said in his cover letter.
Wilson’s arrival at the Senate maintains Republicans’ 16 seats in the chamber. Democrats currently hold 26 seats.
Sen. Bill Sharer, the Senate minority leader, said in a statement that Wilson’s “contributions in the Legislature will benefit every New Mexican and he will make a great addition to our New Mexico Senate Republican Caucus.”
The state Republican Party earlier this week criticized Lujan Grisham for not having filled the seat following Paul’s mid-October resignation. In a news release, the party noted the upcoming Jan. 12 deadline for capital outlay requests and said the delayed appointment created a disadvantage for whomever the governor chose “in their efforts to represent their constituents in southern New Mexico.”
Wilson told Source that he did not think the governor unnecessarily delayed his appointment. 
“I do know they did their homework. I’ll just say that,” he said of the governor’s office. “I don’t think there was any strategy behind it other than just doing their homework.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screen-Shot-2025-11-14-at-12.20.13-PM-1024x586.png,,,2026-01-08 15:12:14.901300

The governor just announced Elon Musks’s company, xAI, is investing over $20 billion in the state to build a new data center and power plant in Southaven. This is the largest single investment in the state’s history, Reeves said, and is the fifth data center complex in the state.
“This is an exciting day for Mississippi’s kids and for Mississippi’s workforce and for Mississippi’s economy,” Gov. Tate Reeves said at an announcement live streamed from Southaven on X, formerly known as Twitter, owned by Musk.
The data center in De Soto County is the company’s third in the Memphis metropolitan area. This summer, xAI purchased an old power plant in Southaven where it is running 18 temporary gas turbines and plans to erect permanent turbines. 
Sen. Michael McClendon, a Republican who represents Southaven, said he welcomes the influx of investment to his district, but also has concerns about the impact such a project would have on natural resources in the area. 
“I’d say it’s a good thing,” McClendon said. “My only concern is the aquifers up there, how much water will be used, how much water gets replenished in those aquifers, is there any way that those will be damaged?” 
On Dec. 30, Musk posted on X that xAI had bought a warehouse in Southaven and planned to increase the company’s computing power.
The company will have 2 gigawatts of computing power in the Memphis area. 
“We’re going to do more,” said Anthony Armstrong, chief financial officer of xAI on Thursday during the announcement with Reeves. “It’s in large part because of the responsiveness and cooperation, governor, from your administration.
 Armstrong added that xAI wants its Memphis data center cluster to be the world’s largest supercomputer.
The artificial-intelligence boom has brought tens of billions of new investment to Mississippi. Local and state officials have welcomed these projects, citing benefits such as tens of millions of dollars in tax revenue and new jobs. The state also passed a data center tax incentive in 2024 that exempts companies from sales, use, corporate income and franchise taxes which xAI will be utilizing. 
“I’m not aware of any other state that even comes close to Mississippi in the scope of those subsidies,” said John Mozena, president of the Center for Economic Accountability. 
The Compass data center campus in Meridian was named the worst economic development deal of 2025. The Center who gave out the moniker cited extensive state tax breaks, little local economic impact and lack of transparency as some of the factors contributing to its decision. 
On Tuesday during a board of aldermen meeting, Southaven Mayor Darren Musselwhite confirmed xAI’s plans to build a data center citing conversations he’d had with the company. Musselwhite called the project “game changing,” adding that the new project would bring around 100 jobs to Southaven and increase the city’s tax revenue. 
Reeves said the center would bring thousands more indirect jobs.
The company has already faced pushback from some residents about the temporary gas turbines it is currently using and potential air pollution. The temporary turbines are less than a mile from a Southaven neighborhood and residents have reported the noise from the turbines has been disruptive. A petition by a local group, the Safe and Sound Coalition calls for the power plant to be shut down and has over 900 signatures.
“It feels like a slap in the face to every resident who’s been fighting for transparency around xAI’s power plant in Southaven,” said Shannon Samsa, a lifelong Southaven resident and cofounder of the Safe and Sound Coalition, “While the community has been kept in the dark for months, xAI is already expanding. Once again, the public wasn’t informed or given any say.”
Elon Musk was not in attendance for the announcement Thursday.
Other news: Eggs, the start of the legislative session and Open AI

Mississippi poultry company Cal Maine, the nation’s largest producer of eggs, reported sales in the second quarter of FY 2026 were down 19.4% compared to FY 2025. Net sales were $769.5 million, compared to $954.7 million in the second quarter of 2025. The company saw record sales last year due to an egg shortage.
On Wednesday, Open AI and Future Caucus held a workshop with Mississippi legislators about artificial intelligence and ways they could use it in their work. According to the company, 24% of Mississippi Chat GPT users are between the ages of 18 and 24. Open AI demonstrated potential uses of AI including responding to constituents’ letters and creating a custom chatbot. Legislators who attended had a wide range of questions from AI safety and how to spot fakes to the future of state regulation of AI.
The Mississippi Legislature is back in session. Ahead of the session, Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann spoke about the ongoing challenges the agriculture industry faces at the Stennis Institute of Government Capitol Press forum. Hosemann proposed eliminating the 1.5% sales tax on agriculture equipment and said that he’s looking into alternative markets for soybeans.

(Photo courtesy of the West Virginia Office of Inspector General)West Virginia has a new foster care ombudsman tasked with reviewing concerns and complaints in the state’s overburdened child welfare system. 
Jessica Bryant, a former Child Protective Services worker, will serve as director of the Foster Care Ombudsman Division. 
“The Foster Care Ombudsman exists to ensure concerns are heard, reviewed fairly, and addressed independently,” Bryant said in a news release Thursday from the state’s Office of Inspector. “I am honored to serve in this role and committed to listening carefully to children, families, and caregivers, while identifying meaningful opportunities for improvement that strengthen the system as a whole.”
There are around 6,000 children in West Virginia’s foster care system. 
Bryant plans to focus on clear communication, objective review of concerns and collaboration with child welfare partners while maintaining the independence and impartiality in the ombudsman’s role.
State lawmakers created the foster care ombudsman role in 2019 in an effort to bolster accountability in the troubled foster care system that has struggled with high CPS case loads, a lack of safe homes for children and communication to those involved in a child’s case.
Along with investigating complaints from foster parents and children, the ombudsman was tasked with advocating for the rights of children and families. 
In 2024, lawmakers passed a bill clarifying that the foster care ombudsman would work impartially under the state’s Office of Inspector General. There had been concerns that the role wasn’t able to work independently without interference from foster care officials.
Bryant previously worked in oversight roles within CPS focused on reviewing complaints, assessing compliance and identifying systemic issues.
She is also a kinship caregiver to a child involved in the foster care system, which “shaped her commitment to transparency, timely responses and respectful engagement with families navigating complex systems,” the news release said.
“Jessica Bryant brings exactly the right blend of experience, judgment, and compassion to this role,” said Inspector General Ann Urling. “Her understanding of child welfare from both frontline and oversight perspectives, combined with her commitment to independence and accountability, will strengthen the Foster  Care Ombudsman Division and enhance trust for the children, families, and caregivers it serves.”
The previous ombudsman, Elizabeth Hardy, resigned in September to become commissioner at the state’s Bureau for Behavioral Health.
Gov. Patrick Morrisey has announced several foster care reform efforts since taking office, including an effort to bring 380 foster children in out-of-state institutions back to West Virginia. Foster children are in facilities in states including California, Texas, Utah and Washington, according to DoHS data. 
Morrisey also plans to expand a school-based program for at-risk children to reduce the number of children coming into foster care. He’ll use $8 million in unspent federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families dollars to pay for the project.

(Photo by Molly Rains/New Hampshire Bulletin)New Hampshire legislators are one step closer to loosening regulations on the state’s meat industry.
House Bill 396, which would permit the in-state sale of certain meat products processed at non-U.S. Department of Agriculture facilities, including cuts of beef and pork, passed the House, 214-119, on Wednesday.
Such sales would go against federal law, which calls for meat sold commercially in the United States to be inspected and approved by the USDA, or by a state agency partnered with the department. In New Hampshire, which does not have a state inspection program, meat for commercial sale must be processed at a USDA-approved facility with a federal inspector present during the slaughter.
There are four such USDA facilities in the state, but proponents of the bill said wait times for slaughter appointments are long and difficult to secure for small farmers. This bill, they said, was an important step to help those farms compete in the state’s meat market.
“We need to be cognizant that our consumers and our farmers want this. They don’t have to do it, but they want it, and it gives more security to our state by giving more options,” said Rep. Barbara Comtois, a Barnstead Republican and the bill’s prime sponsor.
Critics raised concerns about food safety, associated with the lack of oversight during processing, and liability that participating farmers could incur by violating federal law.
Rep. Peter Bixby, a Dover Democrat, said he agreed the problem the bill attempted to solve was legitimate. But the bill is problematic because it conflicts with federal law, he said. 
At a hearing in November, Commissioner Shawn Jasper of the New Hampshire Department of Agriculture, Markets, and Food said the department would not take steps in violation of federal law. Bixby said this meant the state could not enforce the provisions of the bill, including some of its cold storage, labeling, and humane slaughter requirements. He also questioned whether farmers would take advantage of the program knowing they could incur liability or face legal consequences.
The bill still needs to win Senate approval before it reaches the governor’s desk.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/beef1-1024x694.jpeg,,,2026-01-08 14:58:59.245460

(Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY  – The head of a statewide Islamic advocacy group Wednesday questioned whether Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond’s decision to investigate a proposed mosque was a proper use of his office and taxpayer dollars.
Veronica Laizure, Council on American-Islamic Relations Oklahoma executive director, called the attorney general’s plans to use state resources to investigate a proposed mosque in Broken Arrow a “publicity stunt” and “witch hunt” by Drummond, who is running for the Republican nomination for governor.
Drummond on Wednesday issued a press release saying his office would investigate whether the proposed mosque and retail development in Broken Arrow complies with state and federal law and its funding.
“Given the realities of global terrorism, there can be no compromise on public safety and security,” Drummond said. “In our state, we have already seen a radical Islamist sentenced for plotting mass murder. Several 9/11 hijackers had attended an Oklahoma flight school. It is only appropriate to act with caution when the project in question might have connections to the Muslim Brotherhood.”
The Islamic Society of Tulsa is seeking permission from Broken Arrow city leaders to open a 42,000-square-foot community center. It would include a worship area, public medical clinic and retail space.
The mosque is to be built on 15 acres south of the Creek Turnpike along Olive Avenue. 
The  Broken Arrow Planning Commission approved a rezoning request. The Broken Arrow City Council is set to take up the issue next week. The land was purchased in 2014 by the North American Islamic Trust.
Drummond said the North American Islamic Trust “reportedly has ties to the radical Muslim Brotherhood.” The Muslim Brotherhood, founded in Egypt in 1928, is an Islamic political movement. President Donald Trump last year created a process to designate certain chapters as foreign terrorist organizations.
Drummond did not provide proof of the Oklahoma group’s ties to the Muslim Brotherhood in his press release, but also said there are questions about the project’s ownership structure, governance and financing.
Drummond’s decision to invest the proposed mosque “mirrors a broader pattern of anti-Muslim initiatives we are seeing from public officials in multiple states,” Laizure said.
Laizure questioned whether Drummond had launched any similar investigations into other places of worship in Broken Arrow or elsewhere in the state.
“If not, that would seem like a pretty targeted attack on the Muslim community of Tulsa,” Laizure said.
She said there are many other concerns Drummond could address rather than the construction of an above-board and transparent house of worship for a minority  faith community.
The Council on American Islamic Relations is the nation’s largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization.
Unrelated anti-Islamic remarks Drummond made in June drew pushback from a variety of sectors.
Drummond said Afghan evacuees that have resettled in Oklahoma should be sent back.
Tens of thousands of Afghan refugees were resettled in the United States after military forces pulled out of the country. Many of those relocated had assisted the U.S. military.
Drummond, a pilot, served in the Gulf War and participated in the first combat mission of Operation Desert Storm.

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, one of four candidates seeking the Democratic nomination to be the next governor, is ringing the election year with a plan she says will ensure health care in the state is affordable, accessible and fair. 
“I’ve been traveling Michigan throughout the last year as a candidate to be the next Governor of Michigan and no exaggeration, every stop, from Iron River in the Upper Peninsula to here in Detroit, to Flint to Muskegon, every stop, Michiganders have shared heart wrenching stories about a broken, unfair, inaccessible and increasingly unaffordable health care system,” Benson told reporters during a Thursday.
Also seeking the Democratic gubernatorial nomination is Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist, Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson and former Cape Coral, Fla. Mayor Marni Sawicki. While a report from the Detroit News said Gilchrist could end his campaign to run for secretary of state instead, the lieutenant governor’s campaign has not commented. 
With Benson and her campaign have touting her work in reshaping Michigan’s Department of State – taking Michigan from 31st in the nation to 2nd in election administration and implementing several voter-initiated reforms including same day voter registration and no-reason absentee voting – Benson pledged to similarly transform the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, the state’s largest department. SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“As Secretary of State, I transformed our state’s second largest agency to be service driven, saving residents time and money and making their lives easier,” Benson said. “Now I want to make all of state government work that well.” 
At present, the state health department is too complicated, outdated and disconnected from the people it serves, Benson said, later telling reporters that a revamp of the department would be a centerpiece of her health care agenda. 
With many changes from Congressional Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act set to take effect during the next governor’s tenure, Benson said she would ensure the department works with residents to provide easy and seamless access to their medical coverage and other supports.
“That means also building an internal infrastructure that will use all the data that we already have as a state to ensure eligible Michiganders can keep their Medicaid or SNAP access without having to jump through additional hoops, fill out additional duplicative forms, and overall engage in an inefficient process,” Benson said.

Benson said her administration would also fund navigators and community health workers to reach out to individuals to help individuals stay enrolled in their benefits. 
“We’re going to be a helping hand, not an obstacle course,” Benson said. 
In addressing affordability, Benson also promised to establish a prescription drug affordability board within her first 100 days as governor. The board would have the authority to review drug manufacturing practices, approve price increases and hold pharmaceutical companies accountable for price gouging. 
Creating a prescription drug affordability was a key priority for Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer during the previous legislative session, when Democrats controlled both the House and Senate. However legislation to establish the board never made it out of the House Representatives after passing through the Michigan Senate. 
Benson said she would use every tool in her toolbox as governor to pursue her health care agenda, and that she would be looking at legislative action as well as executive action in order to accomplish priorities like establishing the prescription drug affordability board.
To address medical debt, Benson said she would empower the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services to implement medical debt forgiveness programs, increase access to financial counseling and partner with hospitals to limit aggressive collection. 
Benson also said she would expand access by investing into more mobile health care units, which will provide low or no-cost medical services to residents of rural and underserved communities. 
Under Benson’s plan, the state would continue to invest in its health care workforce by expanding career technical education programs and scholarships for students pursuing medical careers, alongside creating tax and loan forgiveness programs.
She would also work to address the maternal health crisis within the state, particularly among Black Mothers who are more than twice as likely to die from causes related to pregnancy than non-Hispanic white women. 
According to her health care plan, Benson would direct state investments into culturally competent care, Medicaid-covered doula and midwife services, mandatory bias training for maternal healthcare providers and better access to life-saving prenatal and postpartum care to ensure all Michigan mothers can access the care they need. 
She also promised to take steps to make sure Michiganders have fair access to health care. 
“We need to ensure that medical decisions are based on transparent data and presented in ways that people can actually understand,” Benson said. “That means we’ve got to use technology to help people also appeal unfair health care coverage determinations made by insurance agencies.”
As governor, Benson would require hospitals to show patients their costs upfront and create an online portal where residents can report hospitals that do not comply, working with the Department of Attorney General to hold them accountable.
Her administration would also crack down on insurance companies who deny care to patients prescribed by doctors, by equipping the state health department to help patients file complaints when their insurers reject coverage for treatments. 
Benson also noted Michigan’s aging population as another area in need of action, with nearly 25% of the state’s population enrolled in Medicare, the nation’s insurance program for individuals 65 and older.
To help care for the state’s aging population, Benson pointed to another one of Whitmer’s priorities: the creation of a caregiver tax credit. 
In addition to expanding counseling services for seniors, Benson said she would work to pass a $5,000 tax credit for caregivers to help alleviate the financial burden of caring for an aging loved one.
“The bottom line for me is this: the next governor of Michigan must be prepared on day one to leverage every tool in the toolbox to ensure health care is affordable, accessible and fair in our state,” Benson said. “And I not only have a plan to do that, I have the experience necessary to transform state government to get this done.”

Mike Dunleavy have issued disaster declarations. (Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)After enduring weeks of record-breaking cold and snowfall that buried Alaska’s capital city, taxing local infrastructure and services, residents of Juneau are now bracing for an abrupt change to rain that will bring new hazards.
The City and Borough of Juneau and the Central Council of Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska issued a joint disaster declaration late Tuesday in advance of an incoming atmospheric river that is expected to create flooding, avalanche risks and possibly landslide risks. Gov. Mike Dunleavy followed that with a verbal disaster declaration that Juneau officials say will provide quicker access to state help to prepare for and respond to impacts of the coming atmospheric river.
Atmospheric rivers are elongated bands of heat and moisture that move north from more southern latitudes. They can dump vast amounts of rain and sometimes snow, and they have triggered deadly landslides in Southeast Alaska and other mountainous areas.
The coming atmospheric river is expected to bring more snow to Juneau at first, but that is expected to change to rain by early Friday, said Nicole Ferrin, a National Weather Service meteorologist.
Ferrin and other officials spoke at a Juneau news conference held late Wednesday by local and tribal officials.
The expected rains will come on top of snow levels that have already strained building roofs, made roadways impassable and caused other disruptions. Officials warned they could trigger lower-elevation floods from clogged waterways and storm drains and various types of slides at higher elevations.
“This storm and the atmospheric river that’s headed our way on top of this historic, unprecedented amount of snowfall that we’ve had does come with an increased chance for landslides and avalanches,” Ryan O’Shaughnessy, emergency programs manager for the City and Borough of Juneau, said at the news conference.
The city may issue evacuation notices if they are needed in certain parts of town, he said.
Dunleavy’s verbal disaster declaration adds to a series of other recent state disaster declarations. On Monday, he issued a declaration for a December power outage in the Yukon-Kuskokwim village of Napaskiak. On Dec. 10, he issued a disaster declaration for a wind storm that caused widespread damage in the Matanuska-Susitna Borough. And he and the federal government issued disaster declarations in October for the damages caused to Western Alaska by the remnants of Typhoon Halong.
The new state, local and tribal disaster declarations are currently only for the City and Borough of Juneau. However, almost all of Southeast Alaska is under a flood watch from early Friday to late Saturday, with additional high wind watches also applicable in some areas, according to the National Weather Service.
Ferrin said the deep snowpack in the mountains around Juneau will likely absorb whatever rain is dumped by the atmospheric river.
That is not the case in more southern parts of the Southeast Alaska panhandle, where there is little to no snow on the ground, she said.
Those areas face some different types of flood dangers, including the possibility of landslides, she said.
The atmospheric river heading to Alaska will bring a little bit of snow to the more southern parts of the panhandle, but that will change to rain more quickly than in Juneau, she said. Rainfall in those areas is expected to total 2 to 4 inches or possibly more, she said.
Combined with expected high winds and flooding, there are landslide risks in the southern part of Southeast Alaska that have been noted by the National Weather Service, Ferrin said.
“We will continue to monitor any potentials for other impacts throughout the event and coordinate with the emergency managers in the southern Panhandle for what needs or any impacts that they’re seeing on the ground in real time,” she said.

(Photo courtesy of Layne Griffith)Florida businesses that purposely ignore whether employees are legally in the United States could face hefty fines or even criminal charges if they hire more than 50 undocumented immigrants, according to a sweeping new immigration package.
Filed Wednesday by Republican Sen. Jonathan Martin, the 34-page bill would presume certain non-citizens are at fault in car accidents, severely restrict their employment, and prevent state banks from loaning them money.
It’s the most wide-ranging immigration bundle proposed so far ahead of the 2026 session, and would extend a 2025 crackdown that removed in-state tuition for undocumented students, imposed state-level penalties for illegally entering Florida, and required all counties to partner with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
The nationwide push to quash all avenues for undocumented immigration has been exemplified in Florida, the first state to create a state-run migrant detention center. Since President Donald Trump’s inauguration last January, Sunshine State officials have mirrored his anti-illegal immigration agenda.
This includes deputizing hundreds of state and local officials to act as immigration officers; Florida is the only state to have all of its (67) counties entering into 287(g) agreements, which are partnerships with ICE.
Martin didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
E-Verify penalties
SB 1380 would create civil penalties for employers who fail to properly use E-Verify, a federal database that checks whether new hires are legally authorized to work in the country. This builds off of another Martin bill, which would require all businesses to use E-Verify.
Employers who fail to check workers’ immigration status through E-Verify before submitting workers’ compensation claims would be personally liable for any costs, expenses, or benefits for undocumented employees.
Purposely not checking their status, however, would result in suspension of business licenses for one year and fines up to $10,000. Doing it again would result in a five-year license suspension alongside a $100,000 fine, and a third violation would mean permanent license revocation and a $250,000 fine.
If the employer purposely flouts this section and the undocumented worker then ends up injuring another person, the employer’s license would be suspended for five years with a $100,000 fine. If the worker kills another person, the licenses would be permanently revoked with a $500,000 fine.
In a similar vein, the bill would impose a third-degree felony charge for an employer who knowingly hires more than 50 undocumented workers. The business would permanently lose its license. The bill would create a cause of action against the employer for any person injured or the next of kin of a person killed by the actions of an undocumented worker.
These provisions evoke a recently closed, two-year federal investigation into Archer Western, a road-building company hired by the state that employed undocumented immigrants for years, as the Tampa Bay Times has reported.
Officials opened the investigation after an undocumented Archer Western employee driving heavy machinery in 2022 hit and killed a Pinellas County deputy. At least 18 of his coworkers on that state-funded construction site were also undocumented.
Car accidents, foreign remittances, and licensing
SB 1380 would create a rebuttable presumption of fault in car accidents involving undocumented immigrants from other states. This means if an out-of-state driver who is undocumented is involved in a car accident in Florida, authorities could presume he or she was at fault — as long as the other motorist wasn’t driving recklessly, under the influence, or clearly at fault.
Insurers could not pay benefits or settle claims with an unauthorized out-of-state driver, the bill says.
Additionally, the bill requires law enforcement officers investigating car accidents to verify whether the parties are legally in the country.
Other provisions would ban the state Division of Risk Management from approving a claim submitted by an adult undocumented immigrant. Unauthorized immigrants would be barred from sending money to other countries and state banks could not accept IDs traditionally used by undocumented immigrants or those illegally in the state with down payments or loans.
All licensing procedures, relicensing instruction, and licensing testing must be conducted in English, the bill says. Interpreters, translators, or alternate language accommodations would be banned.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Kevin Nance)A new Kentucky law that stands to put many peer support specialists out of work should be declared “void and unenforceable,” says a lawsuit filed in Fayette Circuit Court that seeks an expedited hearing.
The law, which took effect Jan. 1, sets new licensing standards for peer support specialists to be employed in many drug and alcohol treatment settings. It triggered the apparently unintended cut-off of Medicaid payments to support the work of the vast majority of Kentucky’s peer support workforce who have yet to obtain the new credential.
Peer support is considered an essential ingredient in recovery. Peer support specialists, who earn $15-$18 an hour in Kentucky, share their first-hand experiences of addiction and hope with those new to recovery. Their duties range from providing transportation to medical appointments and court dates to teaching problem-solving skills.
Mary Helen Shashy is executive director of Grin Grant Inc.
The lawsuit was filed on behalf of peer support specialists Wes Hagenbuch and Adrianna Kenley and Grin Grant Inc., a Lexington-based nonprofit that employs and trains peer support workers.
The defendants are the Kentucky Board of Alcohol and Drug Counselors; the Cabinet for Health and Family Services and its secretary, Dr. Steven Stack, and the state Department for Behavioral Health, Developmental and Intellectual Disabilities.
The suit, filed Dec. 27 by attorney Frank Miller, alleges that no regulations for implementing the new law have been enacted by the Board of Alcohol and Drug Counselors, creating uncertainty and making it impossible to comply with the law’s new requirements.
Hagenbuch says in an affidavit that state government agencies have put out “inconsistent and shifting compliance expectations, enforcement standards, and timelines applicable to my work.”
As of Jan. 8, only 74 people had been licensed under the new law as registered alcohol and drug peer support specialists, compared with 16,883 who were certified under the previous standards.
The legislation, House Bill 505 enacted in 2024, includes a provision to allow Medicaid reimbursements to continue for peer support workers who obtain a temporary credential under the new standards, but the Beshear administration has said that Kentucky Medicaid rules, approved by the federal government, do not allow Medicaid reimbursement for services provided by someone with only a temporary credential.
The Board of Alcohol and Drug Counselors has approved 755 temporary credentials for alcohol and drug peer support specialists.
Kentucky set to pull funding from peer support for recovery, is asked to reconsider

The lawsuit asks Fayette Circuit Judge Thomas L. Travis for expedited consideration and to issue a restraining order and injunction. 
In response to the lawsuit, Kendra Steele, spokesperson for the Cabinet for Health and Family Services, said via email, “Team Kentucky is committed to ensuring those suffering from addiction have access to the support services they need.  
“CHFS would support any changes the General Assembly would take to update HB 505 to allow more peer support specialists to provide services and expand what Medicaid can cover for those services.   
“However, as it is currently written, the law passed by the General Assembly required these changes to go into effect January 1st, impacting what Kentucky Medicaid can legally reimburse for peer support specialist services — which this lawsuit seems to ignore.”
The Lantern is awaiting a response from the Public Protection Cabinet, which oversees the Board of Alcohol and Drug Counselors.
Last month before the law took effect, peer support specialist Chris Sudduth of Georgetown told the Lantern his work hours had already been cut because employers “don’t know how to navigate the new laws.”
Sudduth, 43, a peer support specialist for three years, said, “I’m afraid I’m going to lose my apartment, everything I’ve worked for these three years. Even more I’m afraid I’m going to lose my sobriety over it.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Peer-support_DxO-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-08 13:59:22.184639

(Getty Images)State health officials won’t change their recommendations for childhood vaccines, endorsing the guidance of the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Wisconsin Department of Health Services announced Thursday.
The announcement comes three days after the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Monday scaled back its list of recommended childhood vaccines — cutting its list of diseases for which childhood vaccines were recommended to 11 from 17.
The change has alarmed public health organizations and providers across the country.
“No new clinical data on either safety or effectiveness were presented that would justify these changes,” wrote Dr. Ryan Westergaard, the DHS chief medical officer and state epidemiologist for communicable disease, in a memo sent Thursday to providers and organizations that offer vaccination services in Wisconsin.
Ryan Westergaard, M.D., Wisconsin Dept. of Health Services
“The Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS) stands by our current clinical guidance regarding vaccines in Wisconsin, and will not be making any changes to Wisconsin’s school or child care recommendations,” Westergaard wrote.
“We have not seen any new scientific evidence that would justify changes to the childhood vaccine schedule, which is widely understood to have prevented millions of infections and continues to protect the health of children in the United States,” Westergaard said Thursday.
The department is following the childhood vaccine recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics.
“Wisconsin providers should continue to follow evidence-based vaccine recommendations from AAP and other professional medical organizations, and parents should talk to trusted health care providers about timely vaccination,” said Dr. Stephanie Schauer, the DHS immunization program manager. “This is our best way to prevent the spread of diseases that can cause life-long health impacts for children, families, and entire communities.”
The CDC’s decision followed a directive in December from President Donald Trump to look to other developed countries, including Denmark, in revising its vaccine schedule. Federal officials said the change was based on that review and called the U.S. a “global outlier” for the number of diseases and vaccine doses in its recommendations.  
“The CDC’s new recommendations were based on a brief review of other countries’ practices and not based on data or evidence regarding disease risks to children in the United States,” DHS Secretary-designee Kirsten Johnson said Thursday. “This upends our longstanding, evidence-based approach of protecting our children from the viruses that pose a risk in our country.”
She said the CDC change ignored other factors.
“Copying another country’s schedule without its health and social infrastructure will not produce the same health outcomes,” Johnson said. “It creates chaos and confusion and risks the health of Wisconsin’s youngest and most vulnerable citizens.”
DHS administers Wisconsin’s Medicaid programs and said the health insurance program for people with low incomes will cover all the recommended vaccines, including for newborns. They will also remain covered under the Vaccines for Children program.
The Office of the Commissioner of Insurance issued a reminder Thursday that state law requires individual, small group and self-funded health plans to cover immunizations for patients and their dependents from birth without a copayment.

To check on a child’s vaccine status and recommended vaccines see the  Wisconsin Immunization Registry.

Newsom will tout a 9% reduction in unsheltered homelessness, cheaper insulin and increased clean energy use in California as among his accomplishments, in a speech delivered with an eye toward higher office. 


Gov. Gavin Newsom will promote California as an antidote to the Trump agenda on Thursday, telling lawmakers during a wide-ranging State of the State address that California still leads in a host of critical areas such as manufacturing, technology and agriculture. 
“Every year, the declinists, the pundits and critics suffering from California derangement syndrome look at this state and try to tear down our progress,” he said in prepared remarks released ahead of delivery. “California’s success is not by chance — it’s by design.”
He will tout a 9% reduction in unsheltered homelessness, cheaper insulin and increased clean energy use in California as among his accomplishments, in a speech delivered with an eye toward higher office. 
The address is his first State of the State before the Legislature since 2020. He will use it as an opportunity to highlight progress on some of his most ambitious promises, some of which haven’t been met, while positioning California and its leader as worthy of national leadership. 
He targeted the Trump administration on a range of issues, including excessive policing and immigration raids, saying the state “faces an assault on our values unlike anything I have seen in my lifetime.” And in a common talking point for Newsom recently, he criticized the president for deprioritizing clean energy as China surges forward in electric vehicle production.
“In California, we are not silent. We are not hunkering down. We are not retreating. We are a beacon. This state is providing a different narrative,” he said in the prepared remarks. 
On homelessness, the announced reduction in 2025 of unsheltered people, or the number of people who sleep outside, in cars or anywhere else not meant for habitation, is an important figure for the governor as he seeks to show improvement on one of California’s most stubborn challenges in his final year in office. 
A humanitarian and public health crisis and the most visible consequence of California’s housing shortage, homelessness is sure to be an issue on which Newsom faces national criticism should he make an expected presidential run in 2028. 
But the reduction came after years of increases in homelessness despite Newsom’s campaign promises to address the issue and his administration pouring over $24 billion into it during his two terms. In 2024, the year before the announced reduction, homelessness in California hit a record high: 123,974 were unsheltered while 63,110 were sheltered. That year, homelessness also spiked nationally.
Newsom on Thursday will not announce the number who were homeless overall in 2025. He will tout his administration’s focus on sweeping street encampments and building new mental health facilities paid for with Prop. 1, a bond he promoted and which voters approved in 2024.
He will also speak about making the state more affordable, an issue over which Democrats and Republicans nationally are jockeying for credit after the 2024 presidential election showed voters were heavily motivated by the high cost of living. 
He plans to seek out policies in his final year in office to crack down on large-scale investors buying up houses, forcing would-be homebuyers to compete — a day after Trump also announced a similar effort. It’s a new area for him in housing policy, after years seeking to boost construction. Newsom ran on a promise of building 3.5 million new housing units; the state has fallen far short of that. 
Newsom also ran on a promise of a universal public health care system; he has since shifted to expanding access to Medi-Cal, the state health program for low-income residents that faces punishing federal cuts under Trump. On Thursday, he will tout the state’s production of $11 insulin as one way his administration has tackled health care costs. 
Projecting a rosier budget outlook
The address was also a preview of Newsom’s last budget proposal, to be released Friday. 
Though the state began the year facing an estimated $18 billion deficit and remains threatened by federal cuts, Newsom said revenues have come in $42 billion higher than expected — a “windfall” officials mostly attribute to stock market gains and the artificial intelligence boom. 
That could allow him to avoid difficult fights with Democratic lawmakers over major cuts to programs in his final year in office, while maintaining funding for banner Newsom administration priorities like expanding public school to include all four-year-olds and providing more funding for community colleges. 
With a rosier-than-expected financial picture, Democrats will be sure to jockey for additional funding for their favored programs or to reverse scheduled cuts to Medi-Cal coverage for low-income undocumented immigrant adults they made last year. But Newsom will propose instead to put $7 billion into reserves and $11 billion toward pension obligations. 
And as Democrats debate a proposal to tax the wealthiest Californians to generate more revenue (an idea Newsom opposes), the governor instead will propose to renew a business development tax credit that has been often used by the technology and manufacturing sectors.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/011024_Newsom-Jan-Budget_MG_CM_03.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-08 13:59:22.184639

Joe Sweeney speaks at a press conference to outline House Republican priorities for 2026 on Oct. 30, 2025. (Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)The New Hampshire House abruptly killed a Republican bill to impose budget caps on school districts Thursday, after some Republicans joined Democrats to dramatically alter the bill. 
The chamber also voted against reconsidering the bill, a parliamentary move that prevents the proposal from returning to the House floor this year, in a major setback for the Republican priority. 
After a chaotic series of votes, the chamber voted, 346-9, to strike down the bill, House Bill 675. But that vote came after Democrats teamed up with 22 Republicans to pass a floor amendment to override most of the original bill and limit the cap only to school district administrative expenses. 
That change, which passed, 182-173, proved to be a dealbreaker for the Republican supporters of the original bill. After the alteration, the bail failed an ought-to-pass nearly unanimously, and then was killed by voice vote. 
Rep. Joe Sweeney, a Salem Republican, accused Democrats of deploying a “poison pill,” in which lawmakers alter a bill solely to make it unpalatable to pass.
“So weird how all the Democrats who voted to replace the bill entirely with the poison pill amendment then voted against the bill — comprised entirely of their poison pill amendment they supported minutes before,” Sweeney wrote on the social media platform X.
The idea of a mandatory cap on public school spending increases has become a major pillar of New Hampshire Republicans’ response to high property taxes. The original HB 675 would have restricted the annual budgets of school districts to increase from the year before only by inflation. In order to override that universal budget cap and pass a budget with spending increases, residents in those school districts would need a two-thirds supermajority vote, the bill stipulated.
Republicans have framed the bill as a necessary correction to years of increasing school budgets and rising local property taxes. They’ve said the caps would force school boards to be more thoughtful with any proposed budget increases given the need to convince a supermajority of voters to approve them.
“The number one issue I hear from voters and residents and neighbors is that our property taxes are just getting out of control,” said Sweeney in a speech on the floor. “It’s pricing seniors out of their homes. It’s making it harder for young families to buy into the New Hampshire market.”
Sweeney said residents have not seen relief. “They just go into the school districts where they just continue to propose higher budgets, because they take the money that the state sends them, they lightly increase their tax rate as much as they can before people really start to revolt, and the spending keeps going up and up and up,” he said. “Something has to give.”
But Democrats have slammed the idea as anti-democratic and a threat to local control. They’ve noted that all recent school district budget increases were approved by majorities of voters at annual meetings, and that voters already have the ability to adopt tax caps in their individual school districts if they want. Instead, Democrats have called for the state to contribute more funding to local schools, arguing that could help reduce property tax burdens. 
“The real harm done by this bill will be felt in the overcrowded public school classrooms by … the 90% of Granite State kids who are there, where they have fewer educational opportunities despite their community’s desires,” said Rep. Mary Hakken-Phillips, a Hanover Democrat, speaking on the House floor. 
The House added a number of last-minute floor amendments to the bill Thursday.
But the final — and crucial — amendment changed the bill from a broad cap on new spending in future school district budgets to a state requirement that school boards devote no more than 6% of their budgets to administrators. That amendment was sponsored by three Republican representatives: Lorie Ball of Salem, Ralph Boehm of Litchfield, and Joseph Barton of Littleton. 
Speaking in favor of that amendment, Rep. Kristine Perez, a Londonderry Republican, noted that she and other residents in her conservative town had recently advocated for a local tax cap. But voters ultimately decided to direct the school board to study the issue first, and the resulting study convinced Perez that a tax cap is not an ideal way to restrain spending. 
“We all agree that property taxes are rising too fast and school budgets are the largest driver. The real question before us now is how do we apply restraint without harming classrooms or stripping away local control,” Perez said.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0690-1024x560.jpg,,,2026-01-08 13:59:22.184639

“I want to make sure that I clearly state that the Oneida Business Committee (OBC, the agency that runs the tribe when the tribal governing board is not in session) was not aware of this joint venture or the signing of the contract,” said Hill. “I also stand strong in my words and conviction that the business venture does not align with the nation’s values, our culture and who we are as Haudenosaunee People, and it is something the committee would have never entertained had it been made aware of this.”
Jeff House, chief executive officer (CEO) of OESC, took full responsibility for the contracts, adding  that his motives were to provide a service to ensure the ICE facilities were habitable for residents and also as a business venture to sustain the operation of the LLC’s 500 employees.
“I deeply apologize,” House said. “The decision did come to me and I green-lighted the proposals to go forward, and I know it was a huge mistake.”
House said when he made the decision he wanted  to ensure the facilities would be “up to code, making sure they meet human standards, making sure that it’s properly engineered.” And, he added, “while I don’t approve and am appalled by the ICE activities, these people are being detained and put in a facility somewhere, and what had gone through my mind was, ‘Who’s taking care of them? Who’s looking out for their best interest?’ As much as I have disdain for the ICE activities going on, that’s where my mind went, and I was flabbergasted that I didn’t reach out further and get more information.”
House said he was aware of the recent controversy involving the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation in Kansas to terminate a subsidiary contract with ICE for designing large-scale migrant detention centers, and he applauded the Potawatomi Chairman for noting how Indian people had been treated by the federal government by being placed on reservations and drew parallels to ICE activities.
House said he hadn’t considered the history of tribes and detention when he pursued the ICE contracts, but was more focused on ensuring the ICE facilities would be humane facilities.
According to the Federal Procurement Data System for Oneida-Stantec JV LLC, the recent ICE contract signed on Dec. 26 is for $3.777 million, and another contract signed on Sept. 19 is for $2.601 million.
House said the immediate goal is to begin the process of terminating the Dec. 26 contract, but he noted that the Sept. 19 contract, initiated under the administration of former President Joe Biden, would be more complicated to terminate because work had already begun under that contract.
House emphasized the LLC  would sustain any loss or liability as it pursued the terminations.
To avoid potential liability to the tribe, Chairman Hill noted that the tribe doesn’t directly operate OESC or participate in day-to-day operations to maintain a “corporate veil.”
In a press release, the tribe explained the “corporate veil” is “a legal concept that recognizes a company as a separate legal entity distinct from its shareholders, and it protects shareholders from personal liability for the company’s debts and obligations (meaning the company itself is responsible for its own liabilities).”
However, the OBC does appoint members to the corporate board of OESC, and there are regular reports from the LLC to the OBC.
“It is important to reiterate that the Oneida Business Committee does not approve, negotiate or manage individual contracts of its subsidiaries,” said Hill, “and only provides high-level oversight.”
Hill read a recently passed OBC resolution that directs business decisions to reflect the Oneida Nation values and specifically states that “any employee or representative of Oneida Nation and its tribal corporations to disengage with all grant agreements and contracts that involve Immigration and Customs Enforcement.”
In the future, House said, he will keep the OBC informed of any gray areas of concern.
In 2025, House said, OESC processed $177 million in revenue and made $12 million in profit, most of which was reinvested in the LLC, with a small amount given to the tribe’s general fund. He estimated the valuation of the LLC as somewhere between $80-100 million.
House said one of his primary concerns in securing contracts, most of which are for engineering services, is keeping the LLC’s 500 employees on the job.

Free.,'We must respect and love one another': Steny Hoyer tells the US House he’s retiring,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/we-must-respect-and-love-one-another-steny-hoyer-tells-us-house-hes-retiring,,"WASHINGTON — Maryland Democratic Rep. Steny Hoyer announced Thursday he will retire from Congress at the end of this year, telling colleagues from both political parties in a floor speech he made the decision with “mixed emotion and reluctant conviction.” Hoyer, who was first elected in 1981 and later became majority leader, joins the dozens of members who have announced they will not seek reelection this November. Hoyer said there is still considerable work he wants to accomplish during the remainder of his term, while cautioning lawmakers against heightened partisanship. “I am deeply concerned that this House is not living up to the founder's goal,” Hoyer said. “I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to examine their conscience, renew their courage and carry out the responsibilities that the first article of the Constitution demands.”Hoyer, 86, expressed concern the U.S. reputation among allied nations has eroded, in part because lawmakers and political leaders have stepped back from core ideals. “I fear that America is heading not toward greatness but towards smallness, pettiness, divisiveness, loneliness and disdainfulness,” Hoyer said. “We must respect and love one another. We must remember that we are not great or unique because we say we are great, but because we are just, generous and fair.”Standing ovation, hugs, handshakesThe House chamber is normally empty at the start of the day, when lawmakers are able to give floor speeches on any topic they wish, before members move on to debate and pass legislation. That was not the case for Hoyer’s speech. About 75 lawmakers rose to give him a standing ovation before he began speaking and embraced him with hugs and handshakes after he formally announced his upcoming retirement. House Democratic leaders, Republican Leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana, Republican Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota, former Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic members of Maryland’s congressional delegation and former Maryland Sen. Ben Cardin all gathered to listen to Hoyer.A couple dozen members of Hoyer’s family, including his wife, children and grandchildren, watched from the gallery overlooking the House floor. Terp, lawyer, state senator, congressman, leaderHoyer graduated from the University of Maryland in 1963 before receiving his law degree from Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., in 1966. He went into private practice but also ran and was elected to the Maryland state Senate in 1966. He was the chamber’s president from 1975 through 1979. Hoyer served as a member of the Maryland state board for higher education from 1978 through 1981. He was elected to the 97th Congress by special election in 1981 and represents Maryland’s 5th Congressional District, which covers part or all of several counties in the southern region of the state, including Anne Arundel, Calvert, Charles, Prince George's and St. Mary's.Hoyer took on several leadership roles throughout the 45 years he’s been in the chamber. He was chairman of the House Democratic Caucus before becoming the party’s whip and ultimately the majority leader. He stepped back from leadership three years ago at the same time Pelosi stepped aside. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York succeeded Pelosi as the top Democrat in the chamber, while Massachusetts Rep. Katherine Clark became the whip, following Hoyer as the second-highest-ranking Democrat. The two watched as Hoyer reflected on his career during the nine-minute speech, telling those gathered in the chamber they are “extraordinary, decent people” who are only members of Congress because people from their communities thought they were up to the job. “The only way you got here was your neighbors said they wanted you to represent them,” Hoyer said. “With tremendous gratitude, I yield back.”",,,,2026-01-08 13:12:30.300069

When asked for a copy of the settlement, the community college directed the Iowa Capital Dispatch to submit a public records request, which was completed and no response was received by the time of publication. Drake University did not respond to requests for the agreement or comment.
Drake filed suit in federal court against DMACC in July 2024 after the community college launched a rebranding effort, claiming federal trademark infringement, unfair competition, injury to business reputation and unjust enrichment. DMACC was temporarily blocked from using the new designs. The community college filed a counterclaim for defamation, which was rejected.
According to the releases, DMACC tops the list of where students transfer from to attend Drake and the private college is “among the top five schools to which DMACC graduates transfer.” Both institutions belong to the Iowa Private Transfer Collaborative and participate in “cross-enrollment advising” to allow DMACC students guaranteed enrollment to Drake.
“Both parties look forward to continuing their long-standing partnership and shared programs in service to current and future generations of students,” both of the press releases stated.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents deployed tear gas at Roosevelt High School in Minneapolis Wednesday afternoon as students were being dismissed, hours after an ICE agent shot and killed a woman a few miles away, according to the teachers’ union.
The incident occurred hours after an ICE agent shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Good in the Powderhorn neighborhood of Minneapolis, sparking protests and a vigil that attracted thousands. 
Roosevelt High School is home to the Spanish immersion program for Minneapolis Public Schools. The student population is around one-third African American and one-third Hispanic American, according to the district. 
The Minneapolis Federation of Educators Local 59 said in a statement a union member was detained by ICE at the school but later released. 
“We will not tolerate ICE inhibiting our city’s youth from their constitutional right to attend school safely or inhibiting educators from doing their job,” the union’s executive board said in the statement.

Henifin also questioned the Mississippi Department of Health's recent results regarding the quality of the city's water. (AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis)","After another hours-long hearing Wednesday, U.S. District Court Judge Henry Wingate said he would “deal with” his decision of whether to allow a water rate increase to move forward on Monday. The judge will have a phone call with the parties to hear their closing arguments, he said.
JXN Water manager Ted Henifin and his team of attorneys were visibly frustrated as the judge once again delayed the decision. The utility first introduced the idea of a 12% rate increase, which it says is necessary to keep Jackson’s water and sewer systems running, last February, nearly a year ago. JXN Water’s revenue for daily operations last year was about $30 million short of its need, the utility said. 
Wednesday’s hearing, the latest in a series of court sessions Wingate has held over the last few months to discuss the proposed increase, mostly saw attorneys question an expert the city of Jackson hired to review the utility’s financial records.
Michael Thomas, a former chief financial officer for both Jackson Public Schools as well as Jackson State University, testified that, if JXN Water improved its collections, it would see revenue growth “comparable” to what a rate increase would provide.
Numbers displayed in court showed the utility had greatly improved revenue collections since taking over the billing systems in October 2023. In that time, monthly revenue from water bills has nearly doubled, increasing from $4 million to about $8 million. Over the past year, the utility has stepped up collection efforts, shutting off water to thousands of accounts that were behind on payments.

Yet still, the rate of customers paying their bills stayed between 60% and 69% in recent months, records show. The improved revenue likely represents the utility collecting more payments from previously owed bills, Thomas said. 
Paul Calamita, an attorney for JXN Water, explained that collection efforts can take a while because the utility needs to ensure it can quickly turn a connection back on before shutting it off. That means the utility can only focus collections on certain neighborhoods at a time so that workers are physically present to restore connections, he said. 
Drew Martin, the Jackson city attorney, said it’s unfair for 60% of customers to bear 100% of the financial burden of the water and sewer systems. It’s also unfair for the utility to spend more than it can reasonably expect to recover from ratepayers, he argued. For example, JXN Water had already obligated over $7.5 million in monthly contacting expenses in October 2023, back when it only collected about $4 million a month from customers’ bills.

Calamita pushed back, arguing JXN Water is operating as efficiently and affordably as possible. He also disputed Martin’s point about contracting expenses, saying the utility had funds from the federal government it could use to supplement its revenue. Thomas, though, argued a company shouldn’t spend more than its “foreseeable” revenue. Last spring, the utility ran out of the $150 million of federal funds meant for daily operations, although it will soon see another $54 million originally intended for large projects. 
At the end of Wednesday’s proceedings, Jackson Mayor John Horhn said he mainly disagreed with a rate increase as the “only” solution. Horhn reiterated other avenues for relief, such as working with the state Legislature, “belt-tightening” around the utility’s expenses, and improving collections. He also said JXN Water needs a hardship process for those struggling to afford their bills. 
After the session, utility spokesperson Aisha Carson said the funding shortfalls are mostly impacting sewer service. Specifically, JXN Water is still delaying repairs to two large overflows in the city, one on Mill Street and another along I-55.  
City Council sends Wingate list of requests
The Jackson City Council on Tuesday approved a resolution sending a list of requests to Wingate. Council members Tina Clay, Kevin Parkinson and Lashia Brown-Thomas were in attendance at Wednesday’s hearing.
The requests included:

To extend Wingate’s order allowing amnesty from late penalties for customers who tell JXN Water they’re not being billed from Dec. 31, 2025, to April 30.
To order JXN Water to have in-person customer service available during business hours, from Monday to Saturday, without requiring an appointment.
To direct the utility and city to designate personnel to address billing challenges.
To require an affordability study around water rates.
To order JXN Water to send all sanitation revenue to the city and to do so on a quarterly basis moving forward. (The utuility has been withholding sanitation fees residents already paid on their water bills because the city owes about $6.4 million in upaid water bills, mostly stemming from leaks at the Jackson Zoo.)
To order JXN Water to offer a credit to the city in exchange for making bond payments JXN Water was responsible for. 
To prohibit Henifin from publicly commenting on the city’s attempts to secure alternative funding, “as such comments undermine public trust.”
To require equitable billing for customers in Byram and others outside the city limits.
To review “comparative contracting options” and “increase transparency regarding operational costs.”

Thomas, the city’s financial adviser, in his testimony said more customers would feel comfortable paying if they could more easily discuss their bill with someone in person.
Wingate said he would give JXN Water until Jan. 20 to respond to the council’s requests.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/06074532/AP24012739993750-scaled.jpg,,,2026-01-08 12:59:07.823532

Jeremy Dean, a Springfield Democrat, speaks in February in the Missouri House (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).The Missouri House should order a Democratic lawmaker who sent a “vulgar and sexual” message to a colleague during the September special session to stay at least 50 feet away from her, the Ethics Committee recommended Wednesday.
The committee, with a unanimous vote of its five Republican and five Democratic members during an Oct. 29 hearing, also recommended that state Rep. Jeremy Dean, a Democrat from Springfield, lose his committee seats, undergo sexual harassment prevention training and have his seat on the House floor and his parking spot moved.
The committee’s report and recommendations were made public for the first time after they were published Wednesday in the journal for the opening day of this year’s session. 
Ethics Committee Chairman Lane Roberts, a Republican from Joplin, said the recommended punishment is in line with punishments recommended during past actions of the committee. The ethics committee can recommend a range of punishments, including censure and expulsion from the House.
“Our goal here is to make sure that what we do is balanced, and part of that balance is looking back through our history, how we handled such things in the past,” Roberts said.
Dean was given 15 days to object to the sanctions and did not.
In an interview with The Independent, Dean said he did not object because he accepts that the texts were inappropriate. But he added that he thinks the ethics complaint was motivated by politics.
“It seems more to me that the Republicans saw this as an opportunity to bash a Democrat in the news while they knew that they were continuing to get bad press and losing elections across the country,” Dean said. “And so this is an opportunity for them to continue to try and hold on to the state of Missouri when they know things are going downhill for them.”
On Sept. 4, while Dean was engaged in a sit-in on the House floor, he sent a text message to state Reps. Cecelie Wiliams, a Republican from Dittmer, while she was participating in a hearing of the House Elections Committee.
Lawmakers were in special session in response to a call from President Donald Trump to gerrymander Missouri’s congressional districts to make it likely a Republican could win the 5th District seat held by U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, a Kansas City Democrat.
At the time of the text, the Elections Committee was taking testimony on a proposal to change how majorities are counted for constitutional amendments proposed by initiative petition.
In the text, Dean included a description of an oral sex act with the president and questioned how Republicans could talk while engaged in it. The text message became public when a screenshot of it was shared on social media by former Republican state Rep. Adam Schwadron.
Dean was watching the committee meeting on an online livestream and sent another text after seeing Williams’ reaction, the report states. The report does not describe the content of the second message.
Williams “was shocked by these messages, which were unprofessional and disruptive to the legislative process,” the report states.
House Minority Leader Ashley Aune, a Democrat from Kansas City, removed Dean from his committee assignments and has not placed him on any committees for this year’s session.
Both Dean and Williams testified during the Oct. 29 hearing and Dean admitted sending the text, the report states.
Dean “stated that he recognized that the messages were inappropriate and unprofessional, and that he regretted sending them,” the report states. Dean “denied any intent to disrupt the legislative process, intimidate (Williams), or improperly influence her participation in the committee hearing.”
The Ethics Committee is the only House committee with equal numbers of Republicans and Democrats and a minority member vice chairman. The 10 members all approved the sanctions.
The committee’s unanimous vote shows members thought “the conduct was significantly egregious and that we needed to address it,” Roberts said. “Very serious consequences needed to be commensurate with the conduct, but again, it needed to be balanced with what we’ve historically done, so that we’re not guilty of treating one person differently than another.”
In the interview with The Independent, Dean said he sent the text to Williams because he thought he could joke with her. The are both serving their first terms in the House.
“Since the freshman bus tour, Rep. Williams and I had what I would consider a very good working friendship, and I obviously crossed the line with that text message,” he said. “I totally accept that.”
The biggest lesson learned is “that you’ve got to watch your back,” Dean said. “There are people in this city that you think are your friends, people that you can joke around with, but at the end of the day, a lot of people are here for their own political gain.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Jeremy-Dean-021125-scaled-e1758025686404-1024x614.jpeg,,,2026-01-08 12:59:07.823532

(Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska lawmakers voted 43-0 Thursday to suspend legislative rules to speed up the process of possibly expelling a fellow senator.
Lawmakers suspended a rule requiring seven days of notice before a hearing is scheduled. This allows the Legislature’s Executive Board to hold a hearing on Legislative Resolution 282 on Jan. 12 after the board introduced the measure Wednesday.
The Executive Board, a group of legislative leaders that serve as the human resources arm of Nebraska’s officially nonpartisan Legislature, filed the resolution pursuing the expulsion of State Sen. Dan McKeon of Amherst.
The board unanimously recommended expelling McKeon following allegations he inappropriately touched a legislative staffer, allegations he denies. The board also noted what it described as a “demonstrated pattern of behavior.”
State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, Exec Board chair, said Thursday that the rule requiring seven days of notice serves an important function in informing the public of matters they might want to weigh in. However, he argued that LR 282 was not a policy matter, but a personnel issue.
Hansen said McKeon was given seven days notice of the Jan. 12 hearing in a letter Hansen sent him Jan. 5, outlining the process he planned to follow once the legislative session began. Only invited testimony will be allowed at the hearing, Hansen said, including from McKeon or his lawyer, and outside counsel Tara Paulson, who conducted the Legislature’s internal investigation.
Motion filed to expel McKeon from Nebraska Legislature

The alleged incident with the staffer prompted the Legislature’s investigation separate from a Nebraska State Patrol criminal investigation that led to McKeon being cited for misdemeanor public indecency in September.
The criminal allegation against him has since been downgraded to a misdemeanor disturbing the peace charge, to which McKeon pleaded not guilty after initially attempting to plead no contest and changing his mind.
The incident took place at an end-of-session party last spring, according to the Legislature’s internal investigation conducted by Paulson, an attorney serving as outside counsel. The staffer claimed McKeon made a joke about going to Hawaii to “get laid” and smacked her rear end after delivering the joke, according to Paulson’s report.
McKeon disputes this version of events and has previously claimed the incident was “exaggerated and mischaracterized.” In a written response to the Exec Board, McKeon argued that the board’s assertions include “material inaccuracies and unsupported characterizations.”
There was little debate Thursday on Hansen’s motion to suspend the rules. All present senators voted yes on the motion, save for State Sens. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha, Danielle Conrad of Lincoln, Wendy DeBoer of Bennington and McKeon, who were present-not-voting.
DeBoer said she abstained from voting out of principle, as she is generally cautious about suspending any legislative rule. However, she said she understood why Hansen was pursuing the motion.
“It is a very close one for me,” DeBoer said.



How the expulsion process works
To expel a member of the Nebraska Legislature, first a senator must introduce a legislative resolution presenting the motion. That resolution is then referred to a committee for a public hearing.
Per the Legislature’s rules, there must be seven days between the notice of a public hearing and the date of the legislative hearing (In McKeon’s case, the Legislature is considering suspending this rule). It’s up to the committee to determine whether the public hearing will include only invited testimony, or open it up to public comment.
Following the hearing, the committee must vote to advance the resolution to floor debate. If the resolution advances, it can be scheduled for floor debate the next day.
An expulsion motion requires just one round of floor debate and needs 33 votes to remove a sitting senator. If successful, the motion would take effect immediately and the legislative seat would become vacant until the governor appoints a replacement.

(Cassie Stricker for The Texas Tribune)Faculty at Texas A&M University were told this week that roughly 200 courses in the College of Arts and Sciences could be affected by a new system policy restricting classroom discussions of race and gender, the implementation of which has already led administrators to direct a philosophy professor to remove Plato readings from a core course.
The changes are being made days before the semester begins and after some students have registered to attend.
The Texas Tribune obtained emails sent by college administrators showing the policy has already led to courses being cancelled or renumbered to remove them from core curriculum credit, with professors directed to alter course content or teach different classes.
The A&M System Board of Regents approved a policy in November requiring campus presidents to sign off on courses that could be seen as advocating “race and gender ideology” or topics related to sexual orientation or gender identity. The move followed a student’s secret recording of a professor discussing gender identity in a children’s literature class that went viral on social media, sparking conservative backlash.
Regents revised the policy in December, barring most discussion of those topics in introductory or core curriculum courses unless administrators determine the material serves a “necessary educational purpose” and approve it in writing. This set off a rapid review of courses ahead of the spring semester’s Jan. 12 start.
Emails sent by college administrators Tuesday show that an introductory sociology course on race and ethnicity was canceled, a communications course on religion and the arts was renumbered and stripped of core curriculum credit, and a philosophy professor was told to remove Plato readings and other material related to race and gender from a core course or be reassigned.
In an email to students who had enrolled in SOCI 217, Introduction to Race and Ethnicity, administrators said they “carefully considered” whether the course could comply with the revised policy and “concluded that we cannot teach this course in its present form.” The message acknowledged that students enrolled in the class for a variety of reasons and said those with a “demonstrable need” to complete the course for a degree or career goals could pursue it instead through an independent study course.
Introduction to Race and Ethnicity had drawn scrutiny in the past. Texas Scorecard, a conservative website that is widely read by elected Texas Republicans and A&M regents, published stories in September and October criticizing the course and its assigned readings and identifying the professor who taught it.
In another case, Professor Martin Peterson submitted his syllabus for PHIL 111, Contemporary Moral Issues, for review Dec. 22. On Tuesday, his department head told him he had two options: remove the modules on race ideology and gender ideology, including readings from Plato, or be reassigned to teach a noncore philosophy course. The email, obtained by the Tribune, gave Peterson until the close of business Wednesday to decide.
Peterson responded that he would revise the syllabus, saying he plans to replace the Plato readings with lectures on free speech and academic freedom.
In a statement to the Tribune, A&M said the decision did not amount to a ban on teaching Plato and that other sections of the same course that include Plato – but do not include modules on race and gender ideology – had been approved.
The course changes described in those emails followed a broader review process that College of Arts and Sciences Interim Dean Simon North discussed Monday during a regularly scheduled meeting with a group of about a half-dozen faculty members.
Three faculty members in attendance told the Tribune that when asked, North said the college had identified roughly 200 courses as potentially affected by policy restrictions.
Andrew Klein, another faculty member who attended the meeting but could not recall the specific number of affected courses, said he understood the number to be preliminary because departments across the college were working under different deadlines to submit syllabi for review.
Faculty were told some departments were in the process of renumbering courses to take them out of the core curriculum, even classes that already had students enrolled for this semester. Others would need to remove readings or discussion topics, according to Sally Robinson, a professor who attended the meeting.
Faculty can ask for an exemption if they demonstrate that topics of race and gender are core to the curricula. Robinson said North told faculty members he estimated the college would request about 30 courses to be exempt from the policy, which the university will need to accept or deny in the coming weeks.
“Everyone is worried about students and about what’s going to happen next week,” said Robinson, who is asking for an exemption for two of her courses. “It’s unclear to us, and I think it’s unclear to the college as well, how those decisions are going to get made and who actually is going to make them.”
The Tribune left a voicemail for North and emailed detailed questions but did not receive a response. Two associate deans who were also contacted did not respond.
Peterson told the Tribune that the directive he received undermines the purpose of a university as a place for open inquiry and debate.
“Plato founded the Academy, the very first university,” Peterson said. “If we cannot freely discuss Plato, we no longer have a university.”
The Texas A&M Chapter of the American Association of University Professors and the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression also criticized the move.
“This is what happens when the board of regents gives university bureaucrats veto power over academic content,” said Lindsie Rank, director of campus rights advocacy at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression. “The board didn’t just invite censorship, they unleashed it with immediate and predictable consequences.”
The College of Arts and Sciences is one of 17 colleges and schools at Texas A&M University in College Station, the flagship campus that includes 11 other universities subject to the same policy.
Other public university systems are taking similar steps. The Texas Tech University System now prohibits certain race- or sex-related course content except if it is required for licensing, certification or patient care, and Texas State University administrators have urged professors to revise course descriptions and titles they consider ideological.

The BCA is the investigative arm of the state Department of Public Safety and typically investigates officer shootings.
The FBI did not immediately return a request for comment.
BCA Superintendent Drew Evans, in a statement Thursday, said the agency consulted with the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office, the U.S. Attorney’s Office and the FBI, and the BCA’s Force Investigations Unit began conducting a joint investigation with the FBI.
But on Wednesday afternoon, the FBI told the BCA that the U.S. Attorney’s Office had “reversed course,” according to the BCA statement. That means the BCA will no longer have access to the case materials or the ability to conduct interviews to complete a thorough investigation.
“Without complete access to the evidence, witnesses and information collected, we cannot meet the investigative standards that Minnesota law and the public demands,” Evans said. “As a result, the BCA has reluctantly withdrawn from the investigation.”
Expelling the BCA is the latest maneuver in an ongoing conflict between the Trump administration and the state of Minnesota and has already drawn sharp criticism from local officials.
“This move from the federal government to remove our state BCA from the investigation of yesterday’s homicide in South Minneapolis is deeply concerning,” said Hennepin County Sheriff Dawanna Witt, on X. “This investigation needs to be carried out with transparency, fairness, and without political influence.”

(Photo courtesy of Rose Rohrer UNM BBER)As state environment agencies remediate legacy pollution from uranium mines, one New Mexico lawmaker is seeking $50 million more to clean up a variety of abandoned sites on state land that could contaminate the state’s land, water and air.
Those sites include decades-old defunct dry cleaners, oil and gas operations and the abandoned uranium mines.
Sen. Jeff Steinborn (D-Las Cruces) prefiled a bill, which, if passed in the upcoming 30-day legislative session, would give state agencies additional one-time funding to address such sites.
Lax regulations and impermanent companies in decades past often mean state officials cannot determine the party responsible for cleanup leaving New Mexicans “holding the bag,” Steinborn told Source NM during a phone interview this week.
Steinborn called uranium mines and other polluted areas “ticking time bombs” for the state’s water and soil. In a presentation last year, the  New Mexico Environment Department found people living around abandoned uranium mines could be exposed to the equivalent of more than a decade of radiation exposure in just one year.
“People are being exposed to environmental threats that they shouldn’t have to live with, and it has been this way for decades,” Steinborn said. “Leadership is sorely needed to clean up these areas and make them safe for people, but also to bring environmental justice to local and Indigenous communities.”
Direct state intervention to reckon with the legacy of abandoned uranium mines is in the nascent stages.
Previously, the federal government was charged with cleaning up all sites related to the decades of uranium mining. In 2022, the Legislature passed the 2022 Uranium Mine Cleanup Act, which gave state agencies the power to plan for and address environmental risks.
In the 2025 session, the Legislature approved $20 million for cleaning up pollution. Environmental agencies allotted $12 million to clean up four uranium mine sites, $6 million for cleaning up two areas contaminated with petroleum and $2 million to hire attorneys to track down past owners.
Last month, the New Mexico Environment Department announced the start of cleanup operations at four McKinley County mines. The four mines stand among an estimated 1,100 scattered along New Mexico’s western edge, many on or near the Navajo Nation or Zuni, Acoma and Laguna Pueblos, the result of decades of unregulated uranium mining driven by the federal government’s demands for nuclear weapons and power.
Anti-nuclear advocates expressed optimism about the prospect of additional funding.
“It’s really a very positive move for the state to be providing some leadership at this point and hopefully for the legislature to continue to fund this effort in the future,” Susan Gordon, the retired coordinator of the Multicultural Alliance for a Safe Environment, told Source NM.
Leona Morgan, a longtime Diné anti-nuclear activist, told Source New Mexico in a phone call that cleanup is “better late than never,” but emphasized that the state should approach cleanup in a culturally-sensitive manner and establish permanent monitoring.
“The necessary work of cleaning up uranium contamination is going to be a long-term, maybe permanent process,” Morgan said. “So spending $50 million, $20 million is really not much, but I see it as a path forward, to what we really need: dedicated funding in perpetuity.”
State financial analysts conservatively project that addressing legacy uranium mines will cost hundreds of millions of dollars. A 2020 University of New Mexico study estimated the price tag could be “infinite,” due to the extent of possible contamination.
Additional funds would unlock further cleanups, NMED Uranium Mine Reclamation Coordinator Miori Harms told Source NM, noting that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency “technically has the jurisdiction, but they tend to prioritize their sites and these are the smaller ones that fall out the bottom. But they certainly present physical safety hazards and environmental hazards that we don’t want in our state.”
Steinborn said it was “incumbent” on the federal government to pitch in further.
“It’s great that we’re appropriating money to clean up some sites and help people out. But it’s a much bigger cost than what our state can afford,” he said.

The measure (SB 1160) is sponsored in the Senate by Ana Maria Rodriguez, who represents Monroe and a part of Miami-Dade County, and in the House (HB 889) by Susan Valdés, R-Tampa. The idea has been pushed for several years by criminal justice reform advocates. The bill says the legislation is necessary “to create an independent entity as a unit of the legislative branch of state government in order to restore public trust in the department.”
The bills come a month after an investigation into a Panhandle state prison by the Southern Poverty Law Center found that overcrowding and overstaffing resulted in a high concentration of complaints by inmates about excessive force and staff misconduct.
And they come more than five years after the U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division and the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the Middle District of Florida issued a report regarding Florida’s Lowell Correctional Institution, the state’s largest and oldest women’s prison. The report found reasonable cause to believe that Lowell failed to protect prisoners from sexual abuse by staff.
Nine states have created corrections ombudsman positions since 2018, while another two have created quasi-oversight bodies, according to Michele Deitch, director of the Prison and Jail Innovation Lab at the University of Texas, which runs the National Resource Center for Correctional Oversight.
“It’s greater recognition of deaths in custody, of the violence going on inside, of poor conditions,” Deitch said.
“A lot of those are coming to light through journalistic accounts and through advocates’ reports and from people who have been incarcerated, but it’s also the fact that legislators are recognizing that what we’re doing now isn’t working. There are high recidivism rates, and we’re spending a lot of money on prisons and not knowing if they’re getting anything of real value from it, given the high recidivism rates and the poor conditions.”
The Federal Prison Oversight Act in 2024 established an independent ombudsman office to investigate complaints from incarcerated people, their families, and prison staff.
The office would:

Receive, track, investigate, and attempt to resolve complaints concerning correctional facilities made by or on behalf of incarcerated persons, supporters of incarcerated persons, and the public.
Monitor and evaluate conditions of confinement and treatment of incarcerated persons in correctional facilities.
Collect and analyze data relating to serious incidents, violence, and deaths in correctional facilities.
Recommend solutions to systemic problems as well as policy changes and corrective actions necessary to “protect the health, safety, welfare, and rights of incarcerated persons.”
Provide information to incarcerated individuals, supporters of the incarcerated, and the public about the rights of those individuals.

The Legislature would create a Corrections Oversight Committee of 15 voting members to meet quarterly to advise the ombudsman. They would include four members of the Legislature and 11 members of the public representing various constituencies, including a man and woman who have previously served a prison sentence of at least three within the 10 years preceding their appointment.
The Legislature would appoint an ombudsman to a 5-year term, and he or she could be reappointed for an additional five years. The Legislature would be required to allocate $250,000 to fund the office.
Accompany legislation (HB 891/SB 1162) would create a public records exemption for correspondence and communications with the Office of the Corrections Ombudsman and the Corrections Oversight Committee.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/877e557ce702-tower.jpg,,,2026-01-08 12:12:56.156231

Editor’s note: Below is an excerpt, permission of the Beacon Press, from “When It’s Darkness on the Delta: How America’s Richest Soil Became Its Poorest Land” by Mississippi author W. Ralph Eubanks, copyright 2026. The book will be released Tuesday. At 5:30 p.m. on that day, Square Books in Oxford  will host a conversation for the public by Eubanks and another Mississippi writer, Wright Thompson, about the book and the Delta. Mississippi Today Ideas also recorded a separate conversation between the two Mississippi writers you can watch at the link above.

In places of great poverty, hunger is a disease. When Jack Geiger and John Hatch began their work at the Delta Health Clinic, it didn’t take them long to recognize the depths of the Mississippi Delta’s malnutrition crisis. Hunger seemed to manifest itself like a fast-spreading virus. Public health nurses who made home visits often observed that people had little more than grits and beans to eat. One wrote that many children “live on a diet of cornbread, grits, and Kool-Aid” and that “the effects of malnutrition are staggering.” The inadequate diet of Delta residents materialized on the skin of children who were suffering from rashes, boils, dryness, and a protein deficiency that caused many of their bodies to consume their own protein tissue.
To combat rampant hunger, the two men decided to do something radical: they began to write prescriptions for food. These prescriptions for food – meat, eggs, vegetables, and milk – could be filled by a network of grocery stores in the Black community of Bolivar County, where the clinic was located, and the bill was sent to what was then called the Tufts-Delta Health Center for reimbursement. It was something Geiger learned from his time in South Africa, where dried skim milk was provided to starving children. In the South African townships where Geiger once worked, powdered milk came to be classified as medicine since – like a strong antibiotic used to fight an infection – it saved children’s lives.
Geiger and Hatch’s approach did not sit well with officials at the Office of Economic Opportunity, the agency that helped fund the clinic. They saw a doctor’s prescription only as a note authorizing the dispensing of pharmaceuticals for the treatment of an actual disease, not as a directive to put food in the mouths of poor people. But Geiger didn’t budge. “If mothers and babies don’t eat, all the medicine in the world won’t work,” Geiger responded. What Geiger realized was that people in the Delta were hungry both out of extreme poverty and failed government policies regarding food. In the Mississippi Delta’s past and in its present, hunger is still a disease.
As Robert Kennedy’s 1967 trip to the Delta revealed, as farming in the region became mechanized, people were left without work and were hungry – some of them displaced from the plantations where they once worked, but all without any real economic future. Ignoring this change in economic conditions was a failure of public policy. Yet the bigger lesson of what Kennedy witnessed is not just what happened to the people of the Delta when farm mechanization took over. As historian Greta de Jong has written, “The black plantation workers who were pushed off the land by the modernization of southern agriculture were not to join the industrial working class in the post-civil rights era. Instead, they were the first to experience the transition from free labor to displaced persons that awaited millions of other workers in this new era of economic restructuring.” Kennedy may have been focused on the Delta, but he was also thinking about similar situations in other parts of the country. He witnessed how the economic restructuring of the Delta and the hunger that came with it would spread to other regions where economic shifts were also occurring, whether it was in the coal mines of Appalachia, or later in the industrial belt of the Midwest, or even in New York City’s Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood, a place that as US senator from New York he had personally observed as experiencing similar patterns of poverty.
Robert Kennedy believed in government action to confront mass unemployment, poverty and hunger, but that political ideology died with him when he was assassinated during his run for president in 1968. What replaced Kennedy’s idea of government intervention was belief in unfettered free enterprise. In the end, a blind belief in the power of market forces replaced Jim Crow laws as a way for whites to maintain economic power. Politicians like Ronald Reagan linked government social programs with economic decline rather than social justice. Government action to combat hunger and poverty came to be thought of as wasteful, and anti-poverty policies as creating an indolent class of people who would not work. Yet in the Delta and places like it, the reality was that there was little work and the work that existed could not sustain a family. The idea that people in places like the Delta were not hungry and just lazy is rooted in a myth of American individualism that only perpetuates poverty and hunger. Consequently, a new Jim Crow was born, but one that was visible only to those affected by it.

Over time, as the country moved from agricultural and industrial capitalism to financial capitalism in the late twentieth century and into the twenty first, the push toward market forces expanded from places like the Delta and spurred massive layoffs in other rural communities as well as places like the midwestern Rust Belt. Understanding what happened in the Delta helps us understand other economic developments in the post-civil rights era: the region’s economic circumstances may be particularly entwined with its long history of racial oppression, but what followed across the country links the circumstances there with structural economic changes on a national level. This happened without regard to the race of the people affected. As Delta civil rights activist Fannie Lou Hamer told novelist Paule Marshall in 1970, “hunger has no color line.” Hamer worked tirelessly to develop her Freedom Farm Cooperative to feed poor people in the Delta through grassroots participation. “All the qualifications that you have to have to become part of the co-op is to be poor,” Hamer proclaimed. Hamer knew the emphasis on market forces and the movement away from government intervention also knew no color line with respect to the people on whom it had an impact.
Although much has changed in the Mississippi Delta since Kennedy’s visit and the Delta Health Center’s prescriptions for food, food insecurity continues to be an issue, and food is still a political weapon. The people of the Delta may have more political power, but that power is diminished since they cannot use it to put food on their tables. Political power is concentrated at the local level, not the state or national level. Food and agricultural policies are set at the national level, and much of that power is in the hands of those who use the Delta’s rich farmland for the industrial farming of corn, cotton, and soybeans. Those with power have little interest or incentive to grow food to feed the region’s residents. The children and grandchildren of many of the families Kennedy visited continue to struggle to get food on the table – and the food that they can get is largely processed and high in fat.
In the years since the beginning of farm automation in the mid-1960s, the communities of the Mississippi Delta have experienced health inequities intertwined with discrimination, poverty and racial exclusion. In three Mississippi Delta counties that Kennedy visited = Bolivar, Washington, and Sunflower, whose aggregate population is roughly a hundred thousand = over 65 percent of residents identify as Black or African American and about 30 percent live at or below the poverty level, more than 50 percent of women and 40 percent of men living in these counties have obesity, and the rate of diabetes is 13.5 percent. All eighteen of the counties that comprise the Mississippi Delta are characterized by high levels of poverty, high prevalence of chronic disease, and mortality rates that significantly exceed the national average. In addition, mortality rates in the Delta have increased over the past 40 years while the national rate has decreased. In 2017 the death rate in the Delta from heart disease was the highest in the country, and it remains one of the highest today.
President Lyndon Johnson’s War on Poverty promised to end hunger in America by making issues related to poverty and hunger the “urgent business of all men and women of every race and every religion and every region.” But in the Mississippi Delta, with its legacy of a plantation economy rooted in white supremacy, the eradication of hunger threatened the region’s politics. What the Delta reveals is not the failure of Johnson’s War on Poverty, but the ways farm policy – particularly farm subsidies – undermined those War on Poverty policies that could have had a long-term impact on the health of Delta residents and all poor Americans.
Where the War on Poverty did fail was in its architects’ and planners’ inability to predict changes in the economy that lowered employment and distributed economic growth unevenly. If economic growth had continued from the 1970s on, poverty rates would be much lower today. Consequently, there would have been fewer hungry people in the Delta. The failure narrative that blamed poverty on the poor in Mississippi – and across the United States – only reflects the success of politicians at rewriting history. Had more programs been allowed to begin and flourish in the Delta, the War on Poverty might have rattled some of the structures that created the region’s poverty and kept its citizens poor and hungry. Resistance was in the air, and that was exactly why Mississippi did not want the programs in place. White Mississippians did not want to disrupt the status quo. Once again, the Delta was left behind, along with poor people across America. And the mythology that some of the neediest people in the nation were lazy and just needed to get to work began to take shape and flourish. Ronald Reagan famously noted that America “fought a war on poverty and poverty won.” But a close look at the history of the enactment of Great Society programs in the Delta reveals that the Mississippi political power structure fought against the very changes those programs sought to confront.
The War on Poverty is often thought of as a program that tripled federal expenditures on health, education, employment and training, and economic security programs, all important to the Delta and other impoverished regions of the country. What is less well known is that the War on Poverty was also linked with the 1964 Civil Rights Act and leveraged federal funds to push for desegregation. This gave the government the ability to pressure local governments to reduce racial discrimination and segregation, turning them into pocketbook issues rather than social ones. That is why Mississippi’s congressional delegation fought so hard against the War on Poverty, including access to food.
Three powerful Mississippi legislators—John Stennis, James Eastland and Jamie Whitten—manipulated policies and programs at the intersection of agriculture, food, health, and welfare to maintain white supremacy and to thwart any efforts toward Black advancement in the Delta. The intense desire these men had to maintain white supremacy in the Delta led to policies that affected people far beyond it. But it is through the actions of Congressman Jamie Whitten that this desire to imprint white supremacy on public policy can be seen most profoundly.
Even before the Civil Rights Movement, Whitten had worked against the progress of Black Mississippians, particularly Delta residents. Beginning in the 1940s, Congressman Whitten used his legislative power to block several U.S. Department of Agriculture studies that attempted to identify economic problems facing Black army veterans returning from World War II to the South. The impact of Whitten’s legislative maneuvers also helped keep Department of Agriculture farm policy from considering the impact of its programs on sharecroppers or farmworkers. In the 1960s, Whitten used his power to ensure his district received $23.5 million in individual farm subsidies to reduce cotton production. These subsidies went to 0.3 percent of the population, yet in the same district, the 59 percent of the population living in poverty received only $4 million in federal food relief. This imbalance perpetuated poverty, food insecurity, and hunger.
Whitten also killed a federal program designed to teach displaced Black sharecroppers and farmworkers how to drive tractors and use the tools of farm automation that were displacing them. Rather than training people for the jobs that were part of the new agricultural economy of the Delta, Whitten effectively barred an entire group of people from those jobs. When Mississippi was placed on a Department of Agriculture list in 1967 that would have surveyed hunger in the state, particularly in the Delta, he got Mississippi removed from the list, which prevented millions of dollars of food aid from coming to the state and, thus, made living conditions in the Delta worse. The domination of politicians like Whitten supported the protection of wealthy white rural farmers in the South and fueled the resistance to civil rights and anti-poverty projects that could have changed the fortunes of the poor in the Delta and across the country. He was critical of programs like food stamps and opposed lowering their cost – on the basis of their income, recipients of food stamps purchased a monthly allotment sufficient to feed their family – arguing that “when you start giving people something for nothing . . . I wonder if you don’t destroy character more than you might improve nutrition.”  Never did Whitten acknowledge that farm subsidy checks for Delta planters were their own form of welfare, but only for the rich. Whitten’s legacy was to inextricably link federal farm, food, and welfare policy in ways that harmed poor people everywhere and not just in the Mississippi Delta.
Whitten’s power to control food policy persisted into the 1970s, which meant that Mississippi was excluded from any government-based intervention plans related to hunger and food insecurity even after Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society programs were being dismantled. Whitten’s drive to control national and state food policy contributed to the failure of the War on Poverty in the Delta. It also reveals the overlooked connections between food, white supremacy, hunger and poverty during the Civil Rights era. The logic of politicians like Whitten seems to have been that the only way to stop Black progress was to starve Black people.
Today, in the poorest state in the union, just under 1,600 families receive cash payments, even though over 100,000 families live under the federal poverty line. Cash assistance reaches only 4% of poor families in Mississippi who qualify for aid. Through a historical lens, the story of the Mississippi Delta begins to come into focus as a story of how we as a nation have failed the poor and allowed them to descend even deeper into poverty. The Mississippi Delta is not the poorest place in Mississippi or perhaps the entire nation because of the failures of its residents. It is poor by the design of its political leaders at the state and national level.

Former Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin is back in court making another effort to keep his estranged, adopted son from intervening in his divorce case.
In a pleading filed Wednesday with the Kentucky Court of Appeals, Bevin’s lawyers are asking the court to vacate a ruling from Jefferson Family Court Judge Angela Johnson that Jonah Bevin, now 19, may intervene in any settlement reached by the wealthy ex-governor and his former wife, Glenna.
The appeals court in October had rejected an appeal of the matter by the Bevins, saying such an appeal could not be pursued until the case was resolved in family court.
While the Bevins’ divorce was finalized in March 2025, a proposed settlement remains pending while Jonah seeks to be a party, arguing he was neglected, deprived of an education  and sent to an abusive child residential center in Jamaica at 17.
Jonah is among four children the Bevins adopted from Ethiopia. They also have five biological children; all but one are adults.

Matt Bevin’s pleading argues that the family court’s ruling permitting Jonah to intervene — seeking educational services and child support — is clearly erroneous.
“Simply stated, there is no law in Kentucky that allows a child to intervene in his parents’ divorce case,” said the pleading styled as a petition for a writ of mandamus seeking emergency relief from a lower court.
But lawyers for Jonah said the action filed by the one-term Republican ex-governor is yet another delaying tactic.
“This is another attempt by this disgraced governor . . .to leverage the court system to conceal his conduct or delay access to justice and accountability,” said a statement from Jonah’s lawyers, John Helmers and Melina Hettiaratchi. “This is not the act of a family-focused man.”
It added that Bevin is using “extremist talking points” to deprive Jonah of resources, stating “Jonah simply seeks the support he is entitled to under Kentucky law and in the eyes of any caring parent.”
Bevin, a conservative Christian, ran for governor in 2015 on a campaign of promoting adoption and foster care, often citing his own family’s experience.
The Bevins’ lawyers did not respond to requests for comment.
Matt Bevin’s pleading states that unless the appeals court intervenes, allowing Jonah to intervene in the divorce settlement would cause “great injustice and irreparable injury” to the Bevins. It also “would create a dangerous precedent in Kentucky divorce cases going forward,” it said.
But Dawn J. Post, a New York lawyer and child advocate who first intervened to help Jonah after he was removed from the Jamaican facility, said the only danger is to Jonah if he is excluded from the case.
“Jonah continues to struggle today as a direct result of years of abuse, coercive control, institutionalization, abandonment, and effective disappearance during his childhood,” Post said in an email. “If irreparable harm exists here, it is not the product of judicial deliberation. It is the result of years in which a child’s needs were subordinated, his welfare marginalized, and his existence treated as an obstacle rather than an obligation.”
Post has said in a court filing that she spent three weeks in Jamaica in 2024 working on behalf of the youths removed from a brutally violent facility, including Jonah, and said the Bevins were the only parents who did not “engage” with the U.S. embassy or Jamaican child welfare authorities to assist in the care and return of their child to the United States. The case attracted international media attention after hotel heiress and celebrity Paris Hilton — an advocate for children in the so-called “troubled teen” industry — flew to Jamaica to aid the youths.
Bevin’s pleading also asks the court to rule before a family court case scheduled for March 27, saying it would cause “unwarranted public scrutiny regarding private family issues.” 
It added: “The divorce case has already garnered substantial attention from the media and general public, and that attention will only intensify if there is a public hearing pitting the former governor of Kentucky and his ex-wife against their adult son.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/BEVIN-IN-COURT-1024x727.jpg,,,2026-01-08 12:12:56.156231

State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of Omaha, as promised, introduced two resolutions Wednesday — Legislative Resolutions 294 and 295. The first is a “notice of intent” for the impeachment article, while the second is the formal article. 
The push for her resignation stems from a Douglas County criminal case against O’Connor, 35. She is charged with one Class IIIA felony, driving drunk and causing serious bodily injury, related to a May 21 crash in east-central Omaha. That’s the same allegation outlined in the impeachment article. She was charged July 30.
O’Connor on Dec. 30 announced that she would resign effective 11:59 p.m. Friday. Spokespersons for the University of Nebraska system and Nebraska Governor’s Office said just before 10 a.m. Thursday that they had not yet received O’Connor’s resignation letter.
If O’Connor resigns, the impeachment process will end. If not, Kauth said she will proceed.
“As long as she actually resigns, Monday I will pull the LRs,” Kauth told the Examiner by text message.

Nine senators had already co-signed Kauth’s article of impeachment: Bob Andersen of north-central Sarpy County, Eliot Bostar of Lincoln, Stan Clouse of Kearney, Barry DeKay of Niobrara, Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue, Loren Lippincott of Central City, Dan Lonowski of Hastings, Glen Meyer of Pender and Dave Murman of Glenvil.
Impeachment would require at least 25 votes. The case would then move to the Nebraska Supreme Court, which would decide whether to remove her from office. The Nebraska Constitution already bars convicted felons from holding office.
Neither O’Connor nor her attorney responded Wednesday to requests for comment. 
On Friday, NU regents will meet to decide whether to authorize the university to proceed with an $800 million deal to buy out Clarkson Regional Health Services’ share of the NU-Clarkson Nebraska Medicine partnership and related Clarkson-area properties. It’s unclear if O’Connor will attend or if her vote will decide that vote, which the Nebraska Medicine board opposes. Nebraska Medicine is the hospital and clinical and medical services partner of the University of Nebraska Medical Center.
Prosecutors say O’Connor crossed into incoming traffic in a Benson neighborhood in east-central Omaha around 8:30 p.m. May 21. A passenger in the other car sustained a broken back and pelvis, according to police reports. 
Police say O’Connor tested with a 0.321% blood alcohol level, four times the legal limit. The criminal case continues in Douglas County District Court. She is next scheduled in court Jan. 22, and her case appears headed to trial.
If O’Connor leaves office, Gov. Jim Pillen would appoint her temporary replacement, and the state would hold a special election for the remaining four years of her six-year term in November, through 2030. She was reelected to a second term in November.

But what if you swapped out the person in the bucket truck for a helicopter carrying a giant row of saws?
For the next two weeks, Eversource is chartering a low-flying helicopter that’s giving a new meaning to the nickname “chopper.”
Outfitted with a long aluminum wire, this helicopter carries a dizzying (and somewhat alarming) array of eight rotating saw blades. The blades dangle under the helicopter, cutting trees along a transmission corridor stretching 12 miles from East Haddam to Middletown.
“It’s pretty impressive and cool to see,” said Daelon Carnelli, a climbing foreman, who cuts down trees close to residential homes.
Unlike Carnelli and his colleagues, helicopters can access remote, hard-to-reach areas where utility companies build transmission wires. The lines carry 115,000 volts of electricity from power plants to substations and, eventually, homes.
“This is the backbone of our system,” said Kathy Ferrier, Eversource’s supervisor of vegetation management. “If a problem happens on the transmission, it can affect the distribution system.”

Cue the chopper 
On a cold, recent morning, Carnelli stood by Eversource’s giant transmission lines in Middletown, waiting for a helicopter.
“Here he comes,” Carnelli said. The helicopter emerged in the distance, flying low and slowly, the saw blades suspended below it.
“I’ve seen it tons of times. It still makes me smile every time I see it,” he said.
The saw beam is carefully maneuvered by a pilot who sticks his head out the helicopter, moving it back and forth, slicing off tree branches that are within 25 feet of the transmission lines.
The actual saw consists of a beam with eight circular blades all oriented to create vertical cuts. The contraption is suspended on an aluminum wire. Credit: Tyler Russell / Connecticut Public
“These are young [trees] so that means they’re easy to cut through,” Ferrier said.
The helicopter makes quick work of cutting down the limbs, saving climbing foreman like Carnelli and his colleagues time and trouble.
“What he’s done this morning, we’d be here a couple days, close to a week,” Carnelli said.
Helicopters are also helpful in icy, slippery conditions that can make trees and access roads leading up to the transmission lines hard for crews to navigate.
“We’re eliminating risk to our climbers and our tree workers so they don’t have to climb every tree and work in these harsh conditions,” Ferrier said. “Cold and icy weather puts a lot of stress on the worker.”
Eversource has been using helicopters at various spots around the state to cut tree branches near remote transmission lines since 2020.
While the helicopters aren’t used in heavily populated areas, Ferrier said there is some concern from people who live near the transmission lines.
“We do a lot of outreach. We let people know about the project, we send letters, we go door to door, we let them know,” Ferrier said.
“They want to just make sure that it’s safe, and when it’s occurring. I think people just like to know what’s happening.”
Carnelli joked that the helicopters might one day put him out of a job.
“Times are changing. There’s cheaper, safer ways to do things now, I guess,” Carnelli said. “I’m sure we cost a little less than jet fuel.”

Kevin Steele, the wealthiest member of the Florida Legislature, is putting $5 million of his own personal funds into his campaign for Florida chief financial officer.
“Florida families deserve leaders who are personally invested in delivering results, not just talking about them,” Steele said in a written statement released Thursday. “Floridians are paying too much in property taxes and property insurance, while government continues to grow and waste taxpayer dollars. That has to change.”
Steele is running against sitting Republican Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Blaise Ingoglia for the seat, in what is for now the most competitive statewide primary in Florida politics. Ingoglia was appointed by Gov. Ron DeSantis to the position last summer, and was endorsed by the governor for the seat last month.
Ingoglia been gaining significant media attention since his appointment by traveling to some of the state’s biggest media markets with his FAFO (Florida Agency for Fiscal Oversight) team. They’ve been auditing counties and municipalities, alleging that they have been wildly overspending over the past five years. It’s part of a campaign to push for a (yet to be written) constitutional amendment that would substantially reduce or eliminate property taxes for homesteaded properties.
Steele says that his campaign is also centered on lowering property taxes, along with addressing high property insurance costs and enforcing stronger oversight of state agencies to ensure transparency and accountability.
He is sponsoring a proposal (HJR 201) that would eliminate property taxes on homesteaded property. That resolution has advanced through two committees and has one more stop before getting to the House floor. It does not have a Senate companion at this point.
Steele, a retired tech executive, reported his net worth at more than $307 million in his 2024 financial disclosure forms. He said Thursday that his personal financial investment into his campaign “reinforces his independence and willingness to challenge the status quo in Tallahassee.”
“This campaign is about fighting for Floridians, not special interests,” Steele said. “I’m all in because Florida’s future is worth it.”
Meanwhile, Ingoglia said Wednesday that he intends to take his FAFO team back on the road to begin auditing the spending of local school boards.
“School boards should not be given a ‘free pass’ for their excessive and wasteful spending of your tax dollars,” Ingoglia wrote on his X account. “They should be held accountable also. Taxpayer dollars should be invested in kids and good teachers, not administrative bloat. Which school board should we FAFO first?”
While Ingoglia has the backing of Gov. DeSantis in the race, Steele is being supported by U.S. Sen. Rick Scott.
President Donald Trump has endorsed the incumbent Republicans running in the other two Florida Cabinet races on the ballot this year (AG James Uthmeier and Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson), but has yet to weigh in on the CFO race. The Republican primary between Ingoglia and Steele takes place on Aug. 18.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas leaders approved a $12,000 payment for a former prison employee, settling a case accusing the state corrections department of disability discrimination and retaliatory termination.
Brady Greeve worked at three state correctional facilities in a seven-year span. Months after a motorcycle accident in July 2022, he was injured at work at the Kansas Juvenile Correctional Complex in Topeka, according to Greeve’s federal lawsuit against the Kansas Department of Corrections, which oversees state prisons, the juvenile complex and corrections employees.
His motorcycle accident resulted in mental and physical injuries, including post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety diagnoses. The work injury exacerbated those injuries, said the lawsuit, which was filed in federal court in March 2025.
Greeve missed several days of work in the months that followed the incident, but his supervisors — none of whom informed him of his rights under federal and state disability, workers compensation and medical laws — negatively docked him for his attendance, the lawsuit said.
In March 2023, Greeve asked his supervisors to allow him one day off per week. His request appeared to have been approved, but less than a month later, he received a formal letter reprimanding him for his absences, the lawsuit said. Greeve was surprised, and he confronted his supervisor.
The supervisor said, “It’s not my problem,” according to the lawsuit.
Coworkers “began treating (Greeve) differently by interfering with (his) work duties, being more critical of (his) work, and refusing to adequately communicate with (him),” the lawsuit said.
The “retaliatory behavior,” the lawsuit said, “intensified and increased in frequency” after Greeve requested leave and accommodations in March 2023.
Greeve was suspended for missing work. Upon returning, he filed another request, which he understood to have been approved based on conversations with human resources staff. But in July, the corrections department notified Greeve he was being fired for attendance policy violations.
The lawsuit said the corrections department repeatedly ignored or misled Greeve, forcing him to work and, in turn, exacerbating his medical conditions and pain.
Before the lawsuit, Greeve filed complaints in December 2023 against the juvenile complex with the Kansas Human Rights Commission and the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. One year later, the employment commission notified Greeve he could sue.
Greeve alleged violations of state and federal laws related to discrimination on the basis of disability status and retaliation. Greeve initially asked for $300,000 in compensatory damages for emotional duress, lost wages, pain and suffering, and medical bills related to the duress or injury caused by the corrections department’s alleged retaliation.
Members of the State Finance Council, which includes the governor and legislative leadership, approved paying Greeve $12,000 to settle the case after a closed-door meeting. The council voted unanimously to approve the payment without revealing any of its discussion.

,CommonWealth Beacon,2026-01-08 15:49:07+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,Inclusionary zoning in the legal firing line as Senate tries to boost policy,Jennifer Smith,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/housing/inclusionary-zoning-in-the-legal-firing-line-as-senate-tries-to-boost-policy/,The legal and legislative moves set up a clash over rules governing housing development at a time when there’s broad consensus that the state needs to build more units across communities.,"JUST AS AN end-of-year lawsuit launched a broadside against a decades-old policy to boost affordable development, state lawmakers moved to make it easier for cities and towns to roll out their version of that same policy. 
A Cambridge developer is arguing that the city’s so-called inclusionary zoning program, which requires developers to set aside a number of units for lower- and middle-income people, is unconstitutional at its core. The suit aims to crack the foundations of inclusionary zoning in Massachusetts, adopted by communities like Boston, Cambridge, and Somerville.  
Meanwhile, senators struggling to make headway on a housing crunch across affordability levels are looking to pull all the levers they can, including lowering the difficulty of implementing inclusionary zoning locally.  
The legal and legislative moves set up a clash over rules governing housing development at a time when there’s broad consensus that the state needs to build more units across communities.  
Inclusionary zoning rules condition getting permits to build residential projects of a certain size on making a percentage of the units affordable. Cambridge credits its inclusionary zoning policy with creating over 1,600 units of affordable housing, and Somerville in 2023 described its policy as the “primary pipeline adding to the City’s permanent affordable housing stock.” 
But a lawsuit filed last month in Land Court by Cambridge zoning attorney and developer Patrick Barrett and the conservative Pioneer Legal Foundation claims that the Cambridge policy is unconstitutionally forcing developers to “surrender fundamental property rights” by selling their units at lower than market rate. 
Cambridge first passed its inclusionary housing policy in 1998. As the Greater Boston housing market surged in the mid 2010s, the Cambridge City Council ushered in one of the highest inclusionary zoning rates in the country — a 20 percent set aside for low- and moderate-income renters and homebuyers for new construction with 10 or more units.  
Somerville’s program has been in place since 1990, expanded in recent years to require 20 percent of low- and middle-income units in buildings of four or more units. Boston has managed an inclusionary development program since the Mayor Thomas Menino era in 2000. The city strengthened its requirements in 2024, lowering the number of units needed to trigger the policy and increasing the required number of affordable units.  
Housing production has slowed, even in historically strong markets like Greater Boston, which city officials attribute mostly to macroeconomic trends like the COVID-19 pandemic affecting supply chains and labor costs, and spiking inflation. 
In a statement when the suit was filed, Cambridge spokesperson Jeremy Warnick said the city’s Inclusionary Housing Zoning Ordinance “has become a model for other communities looking to create affordable housing for low- and moderate-income residents and ensure the socioeconomic diversity of the community is reflected in new housing.” 
The lawsuit could take two years or more before a trial even starts. Yet over the course of the challenge, which targets the very nature of inclusionary development, lawmakers may kick open the gates for more communities to consider an array of inclusionary policies of their own. 
A showpiece bit of pro-housing legislation, shorthanded as the “YIMBY” bill, got the green light from the Senate’s housing committee in December. The bill would establish a statewide housing production goal, reduce the minimum lot size for new construction, and do away with parking minimums. But the version approved by the committee also includes new language that would allow municipalities to create inclusionary zoning policies by a simple majority vote of their legislative bodies rather than the two-thirds support often required in local codes. An earlier version of the bill, filed by Sen. Brendan Crighton of Lynn, did not include any provisions about inclusionary zoning. 
Crighton said inclusionary zoning is an important tool for unlocking affordable housing, and allowing the policy to be adopted by majority vote, not two-thirds support, would bring it in line with recent reforms allowing other zoning decisions to be made by simple majority. 
“It’s really difficult to make any of these pro-growth zoning changes with that super majority threshold, which is really not typically how democratic bodies should function,” he said. 
Some of the loudest pro-housing voices in progressive Massachusetts cities, however – proponents of “Yes In My Back Yard” building, or YIMBYs  – are notably cool to inclusionary zoning policies, which some say can slow growth by driving up developers’ costs.  
YIMBYs advocate for robust housing development at all affordability levels, but they embrace the supply-and-demand argument that significantly boosting production is the key to ensuring more lower-cost housing. They tend to oppose or at least voice skepticism of policies like inclusionary zoning that could in any way slow production of new units. 
The Somerville YIMBY group, comparing the downside risks of inclusionary development to a game of musical chairs, notes that San Francisco recently rolled back fees and inclusionary zoning rules as its housing market stagnated.  
“Inclusionary zoning helps lower-income people get chairs, and that’s great,” the group wrote, “But it also risks stopping the creation of enough chairs for everyone, which would only exacerbate the housing crisis.” 
Abundant Housing Massachusetts, the state’s major YIMBY organization, considers the sprawling pro-housing bill a priority because of other provisions. But the new language on inclusionary zoning caught YIMBYs off guard. 
“Inclusionary zoning at the right level can be an important tool for creating diverse communities,” said the group’s executive director, Jesse Kanson-Benanav. “But it has to be at the right level, and even in the strongest market we have in Greater Boston – Cambridge – inclusionary zoning without funding or benefits to developers is not working and producing the affordable housing that we would expect.” 
A standalone inclusionary development bill more in line with the YIMBY pitch was filed by Sen. Lydia Edwards of East Boston, Senate co-chair of the housing committee.  
Under Edwards’s bill, a community could by simple majority vote approve an inclusionary zoning ordinance or by-law that requires that up to 13 percent of units be affordable, so long as it will not “unduly constrain the production of housing in the area impacted.”  
Both Crighton’s broader YIMBY bill and the standalone legislation from Edwards were reported out favorably from the Senate housing committee and sent to the Senate Ways and Means Committee. 
“I understand there are concerns around unintended consequences from our partners in the YIMBY world,” Crighton. “And I certainly don’t want anything to be signed into law that could actually limit housing or have unintended consequences. So we’re certainly open to different ways that we could prevent this from being misused.” 
While the lawsuit plays out that challenges the constitutionality of inclusionary zoning policies, Crighton suggested there is support for expanding inclusionary zoning even if details need fine-tuning. 
“I think there’s still a lot of interest there,” he said.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_6282-edited-scaled.jpeg?fit=1024%2C767&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-08 10:59:46.523638

Josh Stein, left, and Leslie Cooley Dismukes, NC Secretary of Adult Corrections. (Photo: Greg Childress/NC Newsline)Gov. Josh Stein on Wednesday called on state lawmakers to do more to provide mental and behavioral health care for individuals who pose a risk to the public. Stein made a similar plea a day ago during a press conference after a  Council of State meeting.
Stein said the “horrific” murder of Zoe Welsh, a long-time science teacher at the private Ravenscroft School in Raleigh, underscores the importance of support for formerly incarcerated people.
“My heart goes out to the family, the students for the traumatic loss they have suffered,” Stein said. “The courts, of course, need to do their job to get as much justice as possible for Ms. Welsh, her family, as is possible.”
Welsh was killed Saturday in her home by an intruder. Police have arrested Ryan Camacho, 36, in connection with Welsh’s death.  Camacho has a history of schizophrenia and an extensive criminal record, local media reported, and court records show he’s been found incompetent to stand trial at least twice.
The state must make substantial investments in its mental and behavioral health systems, Stein said. 
“This includes more behavioral health, urgent care centers and better outpatient treatment and involuntary commitment options when other interventions are unsuccessful,” Stein said.
U.S. Rep. Mark Harris, R-NC8, criticized the Democratic governor’s remarks on social media, intimating that Stein doesn’t think the alleged perpetrator belongs in jail.
“Get this … Governor Stein believes that jail is not the place for a 20 TIME REPEAT CRIMINAL and alleged MURDERER!,” Harris posted on X. 
The governor’s remarks Wednesday were made during a NC Joint Reentry Council meeting. The council was launched by former Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper to coordinate state agencies to improve support and services for people returning from prison.
Stein noted that 90% of the people who are incarcerated in state prisons will eventually get out. 
“Approximately 18,000 people will leave incarceration this year alone,” Stein said. “Equipping folks with the tools that they need to succeed with their second chance, of course, it’s great for them, it’s great for their families. But it also helps all of us. Everyone benefits when every person meets his or her fullest potential.”
Stein said people leaving prison face tough choices, and state policymakers do, too.
“I believe we must do what we can do to reduce the barriers to successful reentry,” Stein said. “We must choose to support people when they reenter society so that they have the best possible chance at rebuilding their lives.”
The council’s Reentry 2030 initiative lays out several broad goals:

Improve economic mobility for previously incarcerated people.
Expand access to education, employment, health care and behavioral health services.
Ensure Medicaid coverage upon release.
Reduce the number of people returning to homelessness.

With the position of Jackson mayor now held by a former colleague, many state lawmakers say they’re more eager than ever to help the metro area. But their ideas this session of how to do so might not be cutting-edge.
“We’re focusing on what we think are achievable, nonpartisan issues that don’t come with a big-dollar ask,” said Sen. David Blount, a Democrat from Jackson.

Help for Jacksonians with unpaid water bills, revitalizing the downtown economy and boosting the Capitol Police budget appear to be on the table.
Before the 2025 session, the House created a special committee on revitalizing Jackson, which ushered in legislation aimed at aiding the capital city, including laws to ban public camping, limit panhandling, hasten squatter removals and streamline developer efforts to eliminate blight. The Senate followed suit later, creating the Senate Study Committee on Jackson in October.
In 2026, Blount said the Senate’s goal will be to build on the House’s momentum through apolitical, inexpensive legislation.
To that end, Blount will be reintroducing a bill to move state agencies that rent property outside the capital city into vacant offices in downtown Jackson. Last year, his bill passed the Senate but died in the House. 
It’s not the most exciting concept, but Blount said the move will save state money and help revitalize the sleepy downtown surrounding the state Capitol building. 
“There are opportunities for consolidation and rents are cheaper in downtown Jackson,” he said. 
Also on the agenda are public safety, economic development and assistance for the city’s homeless population, said Sen. Walter Michel of Ridgeland, a Republican who represents parts of northeast Jackson and chairs the study committee. 
Michel said he is excited for the first legislative session that Jackson Mayor John Horhn will experience as a non-senator since the 1990s. Before becoming mayor in July, Horhn served for more than 30 years in the Senate, where he represented much of northwest Jackson.
“He knows the process, he’ll be nice to work with, and now people are going to want to help Jackson,” Michel said. 
Michel’s colleagues in the House feel similarly. In 2025, Horhn made his first appearance before the House Capital City Revitalization Select Committee.
Horhn raised several actions the state could take: provide funding for blight elimination in Jackson, approve a casino along the Pearl River and expand tax credits to developers. 
Former state Rep. Willie Bozeman, the city’s chief of staff, said Jackson will continue to push for legislative solutions to its thousands of blighted properties. But he won’t be satisfied with laws that lead to empty lots.
“Economic development also includes removing dilapidated properties, but replacing them with something,” Bozeman said. “We’re still trying to figure out the best way to do that instead of just tearing them down.”
The Legislature is likely to look at increasing funding to help the Capitol Police, which currently employs 150 officers, reach its goal of 180 officers, and the Capitol Complex Improvement District court, Michel said. He said his Jackson constituents are happy with the increased police presence and that he would be open to proposals to expand the patrol area for the state-run force once it is adequately staffed. 
Last year, lawmakers expanded the Capitol Police’s boundaries northeastward, encompassing several schools, the Kroger off of I-55, and Parham Bridges Park.

“Some of the senators and House members who represent areas (around the city) didn’t want anything to do with it, so I benefited,” Michel said. “I said my folks want more police protection, so that’s why we’ve been growing to the north.” 
As Capitol Police make more arrests, Michel said he will also be inclined to support funding for an additional prosecutor and public offender for the CCID court. He’s also interested in the possibility of funding a new booking facility in downtown Jackson to reduce the time officers in his district spend driving arrestees to the Hinds County Detention Center in Raymond. 
Further legislation to address Jackson’s homeless population is also on the table. 
Liz Brister, president of Downtown Jackson Partners, said at a meeting of Michel’s committee in November that Jackson receives homeless people from across central Mississippi because it is a transportation hub. 
“We’re really dealing with the state’s homeless population,” she said. “We see people get transported to Jackson from other cities, from other counties and even from the state’s Department of Corrections.” 
The homeless population is an example of how Jackson shoulders problems on behalf of its region, so Blount said it is only right for the state to help the city. 
But in a Legislature dominated by rural lawmakers, requesting more funding for one city, even if it is the state capital and the largest, can be a challenge. 
“It’s hard when you’ve got 48 people who don’t represent Jackson,” Michel said of the Senate.

On the House side, Rep. Chris Bell, a Democrat from Jackson, said he will reintroduce several pieces of legislation from previous sessions, including a successful law from 2021 that he says could help Jacksonians with unpaid water bills negotiate the amount they owe. 
In 2024, the third-party utility that oversees the city’s water system, JXN Water, began issuing disconnection notices to accounts with unpaid water bills and shutoffs at apartment complexes in 2025 caused some residents to be displaced.
But under existing state law, the utility is not empowered to forgive or wipe out existing debt, Aisha Carson, JXN Water’s spokesperson, wrote in an email. 
“Absent that authority, balances may only be classified as uncollectible for administrative purposes and cannot be written off or erased,” she wrote. 
That’s where Bell’s bill comes in. Enacted into law in 2021, it gave municipalities with more than 150,000 residents the ability to reach a “compromise” with customers who have unpaid water bills they cannot afford because of a billing failure. If the customer agreed to pay a prescribed portion of their unpaid bill, the municipality could place them on a payment plan and deem the remainder “uncollectible.” 
But the law automatically repealed in 2022 without actually being used, he said, because the city of Jackson and the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff were unable to create rules and procedures for the program. 
Were lawmakers to reup the legislation this year, Carson said JXN Water would like it to be “tightly scoped, one-time in nature, and paired with clear eligibility standards and accountability measures to avoid recreating the conditions the utility is working to move beyond.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/27125015/3X0A3609.jpg,,,2026-01-08 10:11:58.340329
,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-08 15:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Former New Haven police chief stole $10K. Who was keeping track?,Paul Bass | New Haven Independent and Mona Mahadevan | New Haven Independent,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/08/karl-jacobson-new-haven-police-chief-stole-10k-audit/,The scandal goes back six years. City officials were unable to say whether annual financial reports were filed or who was minding the store.,"The timeline of the police department’s confidential informant cash scandal potentially has stretched to six years — with officials unable to say whether annual financial reports were filed or who was minding the store.
That was the latest development Wednesday in the fallout from Monday’s revelation that now-retired Police Chief Karl Jacobson reportedly admitted to stealing $10,000 money from the department’s fund for paying cash to confidential informants (CI).
Jacobson resigned, put in for retirement, and admitted stealing the $10,000 as assistant chiefs and Mayor Justin Elicker confronted him about the allegation, Elicker said at a Wednesday afternoon press conference. Elicker appointed Assistant Chief David Zannelli (who was technically responsible for the fund under department guidelines) to serve as acting chief as both an internal investigation and a state criminal investigation take place.
Click here to watch Wednesday’s presser, at which the mayor and acting chief updated the press on the scandal. They said it’s unclear whether or not $10,000 was the extent of the missing money, out of a CI bank account that typically receives $75,000 a year from the general fund.
Jacobson has controlled the CI fund, including cash flow and reporting responsibilities, since 2019, according to Zannelli, even though Jacobson was supposed to hand down those responsibilities to the relevant assistant chief when he became chief in 2022. Zannelli said both he and his predecessor as assistant chief in charge of investigations, Bertram Ettienne, repeatedly asked Jacobson to hand over the CI money and the distribution responsibilities; he said Jacobson said they needed training first, then didn’t arrange for the training. (Jacobson has not responded to requests for comment.)
Do audit reports exist? Who watched?
Zannelli told the Independent Wednesday that so far officials have not seen any evidence of required CI fund annual cash audits since Jacobson took control of the fund in 2019 (when he became assistant chief of investigations). That search will be part of the investigation into the missing money.
“We don’t know. We have no reason to think so,” Zannelli said when asked if those six years of reports exist.
Under department rules, the assistant chief, not the chief, was responsible for preparing those audits.
At the request of the state’s attorney’s office, the city has sealed off the chief’s office in order to preserve evidence. That delays the department’s ability to search for documents like the audits, according to Zannelli.
Zannelli was asked in an interview Wednesday why he never submitted the annual report as assistant chief. (Zannelli, who previously was the assistant chief in charge of patrol, stepped into the role of assistant chief of investigations in January 2025, after switching roles with Ettienne.)
Zannelli said that was because the chief was controlling the fund — and because of what he called ambiguity in the city’s general orders.
“We had no reason at the time to believe the chief of police had any integrity issues,” Zannelli said.
Elicker was asked at Wednesday’s press conference whether anyone in government should have noticed over six years (the time Elicker has been mayor) whether or not CI financial audits were ever prepared.
“It’s a good question,” Elicker responded. “We are looking into this. Clearly this result is something that is not desirable. We want to make sure it never happens.”
Elicker was asked if he should have appointed Zannelli as acting chief before an investigation is complete into the CI fund, since Zannelli had technical authority of the fund according to the general orders. In the past Elicker has appointed the city’s chief administrative officer, who oversees the police department, as acting police chief after the departure of the chief. 
Elicker didn’t address the issue about Zannelli’s legal responsibility for the fund. Instead he responded, “I considered a lot of options. I’m confident in my choice. I’ve gotten to know and watch Chief Zannelli. He’s a strong leader. In every experience I have had with him, he has strong integrity. He and the two other assistant chiefs came forward under what any of us would imagine is a difficult situation [to challenge] someone who was their mentor, who promoted them to their positions.”
Elicker said that, over the course of 2025, funds were regularly withdrawn each month from the CI bank account in $5,000 increments by Chief Jacobson. “The only exceptions” to that, Elicker noted, are that Jacobson withdrew a total of $10,000 — in two separate $5,000 increments — in both November and December.
There is currently a total of $50,766.09 in the CI fund bank account. The city has frozen the account pending the ongoing investigation, which is being led by the New Britain state’s attorney’s office.
Who was responsible for audits?
The general order for the running of the CI program specifies that the assistant chief of investigations — not the chief — shall “keep a case account log reflecting all case expenditures.” That assistant chief — not the chief — is also directed to conduct “an annual audit” of expenditures.
The general orders do give both the chief and the assistant chief power to prepare a separate annual audit — not of cash expenditures, but of “confidential informant files.” It also gives both the assistant chief and the chief the power to approve reactivating inactive confidential informants.
Because the chief is given those powers in the general orders, that created ambiguity about whether the chief in fact had control over and responsibility for all required reports, Zannelli claimed.
“I don’t know how you can do one without the other,” he said of the conflicting language about handling CI files and handling CI cash.
Just to be clear, Zannelli referred to two separate parts of the CI general order delineating two separate responsibilities:

Section 4.04.04 has a section entitled “CONFIDENTAL INFORMANT MANAGEMENT.” That refers to an audit specifically related to handling of CI files: “An annual audit of the Department’s confidential informant files shall be conducted by the Chief of Police or his/her designee to ensure that they are being properly maintained, and that they contain all the necessary documentation.”
A separate section is entitled “MANAGEMENT OF CONFIDENTIAL FUNDS” with a subsection, 4.04.07, entitled “ACCOUNTING PROCEDURES.” It reads in part: “The Assistant Chief of Investigations will establish an accounting system for the Confidential Funds Account.  … An annual audit will be performed by the Assistant Chief of Investigations.”

The police chief is not mentioned in the second part. By design. In order to build safeguards into the system.
Would policy tweaks help?
Mayor Elicker said at Wednesday’s presser that the city plans to engage outside experts to help explore updating CI program guidelines. He said it’s too early to specify what changes would take place. “We’re committed to making sure this doesn’t happen again,” he said.
Acting Chief Zannelli said he plans to recommend to the Board of Police Commissioners that it make language in the general order more specific, to spell out which official has which responsibility.
It’s an important question: New Haven crafted its current CI policy in response to scandals over top cops stealing CI cash. (Click here for a previous Independent story about that.) National criminal justice experts in 2008 helped New Haven craft that policy, which was updated in 2016. A central tenet is that control over the CI cash and files should not rest with a single person without safeguards and multiple responsibilities. The intention was to prevent top cops from doing what Chief Jacobson allegedly admitted to doing.
University of New Haven criminal justice Professor John DeCarlo said that policy “reflects pretty much standard practice in the industry” with a reliance on “internal trust and annual audits.”
Studies from federal research agencies like the National Institute of Justice have shown that even with those policies, “cash-based funds are vulnerable when senior leadership of the department has authority that is concentrated and oversight is just internal,” DeCarlo said, without speaking specifically about what happened in New Haven.
New best practices include adding “independent audits, segregation of financial duties and surprise cash counts” to the mix, DeCarlo said.
“Without those, well-written policies like the one New Haven has in place could fail,” he said. As just happened.

DemasFour of Michigan’s Democratic representatives joined with Republicans from New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia on Tuesday in introducing a bill they say would close major regulatory gaps and strengthen government oversight on PFAS air pollution. 
U.S. Reps. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham), Debbie Dingell (D-Ann Arbor), Rashida Tlaib (D-Detroit) and Hillary Scholten (D-Grand Rapids) introduced the Prevent Release of Toxic Emissions, Contamination, and Transfer – or PROTECT – Act alongside Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.), Mike Lawler (R-N.Y.), and Jen Kiggans (R-Va.). 
If passed into law, the Protect Act would require the Environmental Protection Agency to classify PFAS, or Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances, as hazardous pollutants under the Clean Air Act.
It would also require the agency to identify industries and facilities that release PFAS into the air, begin setting enforceable limits on PFAS air pollution from major sources and strengthen cleanup responsibility and public reporting when these chemicals are released into the environment.
PFAS, sometimes referred to as forever chemicals, are a group of man-made substances found in our water, soil, air and food, and break down very slowly, accumulating in people, animals and the environment. 
These chemicals have been linked to a number of negative health effects, including increased cholesterol levels, reduced immune system responses, interference with the body’s natural hormones, increased risks of multiple types of cancer and reproductive harms including decreased fertility and high blood pressure in pregnant women.
Michigan is one of the states most heavily impacted by PFAS pollution, with more than 300 confirmed contaminated sites and more areas where contamination is suspected.
“Michigan communities have lived with PFAS contamination for too long. The PROTECT Act closes dangerous loopholes in how these toxic chemicals are regulated, strengthens oversight of PFAS air pollution, and holds polluters accountable,” Stevens said in a statement. “This is about protecting the public health and safety of every Michigander and delivering real results for Michigan families.”
Fitzpatrick, who chairs the Congressional PFAS task force alongside Kiggans, Dingell and U.S. Rep. Kristen McDonald Rivet (D-Bay City), said the country’s clean air protections should reflect how pollution actually occurs. 
“PFAS ‘forever chemicals’ are released into the air and spread beyond their point of origin, yet they are not fully regulated as hazardous air pollutants,” He said noting that the bipartisan PROTECT Act corrects that failure by and strengthens the EPA’s ability to prevent exposure and protect public health.

(Photo by Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)TOPEKA — The third full year of Kansas’ 988 suicide and crisis hotline revealed growing demand for intervention services available at five regional call centers, resulting in a recommendation to the Kansas Legislature for a significant increase in state funding.
The hotline was implemented nationally and in Kansas in July 2022, and monthly call volume went from a high of 2,287 in 2023 to 3,231 in 2024 and 3,796 in 2025.
In 2025, the latest annual report shows, monthly volume in terms of people reaching out for help ranged from a low of 2,487 in February to the high of 3,796 in October.
The annual report mandated by the Legislature, which was developed by the state’s 988 Coordinating Council, indicated the in-state answer rate of hotline calls remained above the 90% goal during five months of 2025. The low in 2025 was 83.7% in February, but the rate didn’t fall below 89.1% after March.
“The 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline is a critical resource for Kansans in moments of distress,” said Andrew Brown, deputy secretary of the Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services. “Whether someone is facing a mental health crisis, struggling with substance use or simply needs someone to talk to, 988 provides immediate, confidential support anytime, anywhere in Kansas.”
In the report to the Legislature, the state council recommended the budget cap for the 988 fund should be raised to $13 million from the current maximum of $10 million.
The council urged state lawmakers to identify alternative revenue sources, including the possibility of earmarking a percentage of state lottery or sports gambling revenue to the fund. The council raised potential of the Legislature adopting a dedicated telecommunications fee to provide stable funding for the Kansas network. Thirteen states and territories fund their programs with a telecommunications fee.
In addition, the council proposed the Legislature extend life of the state advisory panel beyond June 30, 2026.
The 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline in Kansas offers around-the-clock access to trained crisis counselors who work to help people experiencing distress, including thoughts of suicide, mental health complexities or substance use abuse.
The call centers in Kansas have been operated by HeadQuarters Kansas in Lawrence, Johnson County Mental Health Center, Wyandot Behavioral Health Network, COMCARE of Sedgwick County and HealthSource Integrated Solutions in Topeka.
The centers all reported challenges recruiting and retaining qualified staff, especially for 12-hour clinical shifts.

(Photo courtesy of Ørsted)Rhode Island and Connecticut attorneys general and the Revolution Wind developers are now taking on the Trump administration under one lawsuit rather than two.
Senior Judge Royce C. Lamberth of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on Wednesday granted the request made two days earlier by Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha and Connecticut Attorney General William Tong to consolidate their joint complaint with a similar case led by the developers of Rhode Island’s signature offshore wind project.
Neronha’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Thursday.
The decision cements a united front between the two state prosecutors and the international companies — including Danish renewable energy giant Orsted A/S — developing the 704-megawatt wind behemoth south of Rhode Island’s coastline. Despite being fully federally permitted in late 2023 and 87% complete, the 65-turbine project has been at a standstill since Dec. 22, when federal regulators issued a suspension order. 
The stop work order, which also applied to four other offshore wind projects along the East Coast, was met with swift backlash by state and federal officials, environmental advocates and labor leaders who decried the economic and environmental consequences for Rhode Island. Outrage mounted even more because it was the second time Trump’s anti-wind sentiment had forced work to stop on the project. Construction was already halted for a monthlong period starting in August when federal regulators attempted to pause the project under the guise of national security concerns. 
The initial stop work order prompted the two separate lawsuits — one from the AGs, and one from the developers who had already invested $5 billion into the project. Both complaints argued the Trump administration violated constitutional separation of powers, seeking court intervention to allow time-sensitive construction to resume.
On Sept. 22, Lamberth granted the developers’ request for a preliminary injunction, barring the Trump administration from intervening in the project, at least temporarily. Meanwhile, the AGs case has languished, first in Rhode Island and later, in D.C. where it was transferred on Dec. 11.
After the second stop work order, the project developers turned again to the courts, seeking a second preliminary injunction to continue the final stages of on- and offshore building ahead of a mid-2026 operational date. Rather than continue on separate paths, the AGs asked Lamberth to let them join forces with the developers, consolidating the two cases into one.
The combined legal fight will play out in a hearing scheduled in Lamberth’s D.C. courtroom on Monday afternoon. Much like the initial complaint, the new legal filings argue that federal regulators have overstepped their power while emphasizing the consequences of the 90-day suspension order.
The developers estimate they are losing $1.44 million each day of the pause, with a $6 billion fallout and potential contract breaches if they cannot resume work by Monday, Jan. 12. Meanwhile, 200 union workers — out of 2,000 total employed through the project — are on standby. 
Rhode Island’s ability to meet mandated emissions reductions is at risk without resumption and completion of the project, which is also crucial to reliable and predictable energy supply for the regional grid.
The U.S. Department of Justice, which is representing the Trump administration, did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment Thursday morning. The Justice Department has until the end of the day to file its written response to the developers’ complaint. 
Also affected by the suspension order are Sunrise Wind and Empire Wind, both off New York’s coastline; Vineyard Wind 1, south of Martha’s Vineyard; and Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind. Developers for Sunrise Wind, Empire Wind and the Virginia project have also filed separate federal lawsuits against the Trump administration seeking to resume their projects.

This story was originally reported by Ebony JJ Curry of The 19th.  Meet Ebony and read more of their reporting on gender, politics and policy.
Detroit entered a new year with the same winter math: fixed incomes that don’t stretch, heat that costs more than many seniors can safely afford and food in their homes that runs out before the month does. For older adults, particularly older women, who are living alone, one delayed benefit, one utility notice or one missed ride can turn a hard week into a crisis — quietly, behind a closed door, without the public naming it as an emergency.
“You feel sad because you don’t want your parents to go through that lonely moment, a cold moment, a hunger moment,” said Joanne Crawley, a retiree who sees these crises unfolding every week through her volunteer work. “And it’s like, what can I do moving forward to help them?”
Older women are more likely to be on their own in late life, and that changes what winter looks like when money, mobility or family support runs thin. The Administration for Community Living, a federal agency that funds and coordinates services so older adults and people with disabilities can live independently in their communities, estimates that in 2023, 33 percent of older women living outside institutional settings lived alone, compared with 22 percent of older men. ACL also reported that 29 percent of older women are widows.
Anne Holmes Davis, vice president of planning and program development at the Detroit Area Agency on Aging, described who shows up when older women reach out for food help. “Most older women who come to the Detroit Area Agency on Aging for food assistance are often widowed, divorced or never married and living on Social Security or [Supplemental Security Income] SSI,” Davis said.
Davis said many are “unable to proactively plan for their basic needs while dealing with loneliness, poor social support and limited financial resources. They are more likely unable to navigate obtaining benefits and services on their own.”
The income gap that these women struggle with makes that isolation harder to survive.
A federal indicators report on older Americans puts the poverty rate for women 65 and older at 11.2 percent, compared with 9 percent for men. Black women are even more vulnerable — the poverty rate for non-Hispanic Black adults 65 and older sits at 17.6 percent. The Treasury Department has long documented how women’s earnings and savings often take hits from career disadvantages tied to the overrepresentation of women of color in lower-wage occupations and the underrepresentation of Black women in higher-paying jobs.
Crawley is 69 and a senior herself.
She has spent years volunteering with Focus: HOPE, the Detroit nonprofit founded in 1968 after the 1967 Detroit civil unrest, with a mission that names what it is up against: “Recognizing the dignity and beauty of every person, we pledge intelligent and practical action to overcome racism, poverty, and injustice.”
Her route has run through Focus: HOPE’s Food for Seniors program, which provides monthly food boxes to participants 60 and older across Wayne, Oakland, Macomb, Washtenaw, Lapeer, Tuscola, Huron, Sanilac, and St. Clair Counties.
Detroit often talks about homelessness as something you can see — a person outside in winter, a person sleeping in a car, a person carrying everything they own. Crawley keeps running into a different reality: older adults who still have a roof and still live through the same crisis conditions — hunger, unsafe cold, isolation — without the public ever calling it homelessness.
It can look like staying inside because transportation is unreliable. It can look like stretching medication and meals at the same time. It can look like living alone with a landlord who doesn’t fix what winter exposes.
Seniors don’t always say it plainly on day one. Crawley says they talk when they trust you.
“When the pandemic hit my daughter was telling me about this program,” she said. “I was just open and interested to be a help because a lot of seniors are home and they don’t have anyone to talk to. So, we were the people that they talked to.”
USDA’s Economic Research Service reported that in 2023, 9.3 percent of U.S. households with an adult age 65 or older were food insecure at some point during the year. For households where an adult 65 or older lived alone, the food insecurity rate was 11 percent. In Michigan, Forgotten Harvest reports 291,000 seniors 60 and older are affected by food insecurity.
Nearly half of them are in the Metro Detroit area.
“Living alone is not just a personal detail — it changes access. Solo agers are more at risk of food insecurity and they are more likely to be women over the age of 50,” Davis said. “Since they are more likely to live alone, they don’t hear about community resources and services available through faith-based organizations, non-profits and other organizations.
Struggles with utility costs show up in the same households. A Center for American Progress analysis found that in 2023, nearly 1 in 3 older adults — 14.8 million people — were “energy insecure,” meaning they cut back on basics like medicine or food to pay energy bills, kept homes at unsafe temperatures, or couldn’t pay an energy bill in the prior 12 months.
“The winter months in Michigan and Metro Detroit can be a particularly difficult time as utility bills rise,” Davis said. “The increased cost can make it difficult for food to last for the entire month, leading to skipped meals or even utility shut-offs.”
Davis also pointed to how hunger sits alongside other barriers: Her agency’s community needs assessment survey found that 20 percent of respondents did not have access to a vehicle and that more than 90 percent of caregivers — most of them older women — had not been to the doctor in the last year.
Frank Kubik, director of Focus: HOPE’s food program, says many seniors won’t voluntarily share how bad things are for them. He described what staff and volunteers do to understand the need without forcing someone to say it out loud.
“What we ask people to do sometimes when you’re delivering food is to ask if you can put it away for the senior,” Kubik said. “You don’t want to intrude, people sometimes don’t want to tell you their situations, and I get that.”
He explained the questions that could follow.
“Can I put it in your cupboard? Can I put it away in your refrigerator?” he said. “And then it gives you a chance to open up a cupboard or open a refrigerator and see what’s actually in there.”
Kubik described one home that has not left him, “A person had very little. And when I say very little, I’m talking about like a can of applesauce or something, and that was it.”
“How are seniors in this country living off a can of applesauce or something like that?… It’s just not right. It’s got to be a better way.”
The Social Security Administration estimated the average monthly retirement benefit for January 2025 was $1,976. For seniors on SSIe, the agency reported that in December 2024 the average monthly federally administered SSI payment for recipients age 65 or older was $576. All of which is supposed to cover rent, utilities, transportation, co-pays, prescriptions, food and the small costs that pile up quietly, including toiletries.
“It kind of just reminds you of how fragile things are and any disruption to whatever is already happening, whether it’s SNAP, whether it’s our program, whether it’s your Social Security check, it all has a huge impact,” he said.
Focus: HOPE’s Food for Seniors program exists because that stack of problems is real, and because someone has to meet people where they are, not where the system assumes they should be, Kubik said. Crawley has learned the same lesson from doorsteps.
The help that matters is the help people can actually reach, keep and use without losing their dignity in the process. Sometimes it looks like a warm meal. Sometimes it looks like groceries put away in a clean cupboard. Sometimes it looks like a conversation long enough for the truth to come out.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/detroit_seniors_weather.jpg,,,2026-01-08 09:58:08.035160

(Photo from video by Joaqlin Estus/ICT)Alaska’s annual population estimate will be delayed almost a month due to last year’s federal government shutdown.
State demographer David Howell said on Wednesday that the state estimate isn’t expected until at least Jan. 28 due to the lack of required data from the U.S. Census Bureau.
The estimate is typically published in the first full week of January by the Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development and reflects information as of July the previous year.
While the department uses Permanent Fund Dividend data to hone its guess, it also incorporates Census data published annually. That data, normally available by the start of the year, isn’t expected until Jan. 27, Howell said. That means the state’s estimate can’t be finalized. 
The estimate is a barometer of the state’s economic and social health: When the state’s economy is booming and the Lower 48’s economy is stagnant, in-migration surges. When the opposite is true, more people leave the state than arrive.
Last year’s estimate showed 741,147 residents, the highest population since 2017, in part due to an unexpected surge in the estimated number of people moving to Alaska from outside the United States. 
If the new estimate is on par or above last year’s figure, it could be a sign that the state’s decade-long economic malaise is ebbing. 
This year’s estimate is also expected to incorporate an increase in military residents in and near Fairbanks, which could boost the Golden Heart’s population. 
In the long run, Alaska’s population is expected to drop because a lack of new arrivals has caused the state’s average age to rise.
That leads to a drop in the number of new births and a rise in the number of elderly Alaskans. By 2050, the agency expects the state’s population to drop by about 2%.

The UNC Board of Governors voted in May 2024 to formally repeal the system’s policy on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) in favor of “principled neutrality.”
Still, equity has remained in the political crosshairs, with Republicans lawmakers filing multiple bills in the 2025 session to  prohibit the support, funding or implementation of DEI programs in state government and education.

Bart Goodson, the UNC System’s senior vice president for government affairs, told members of the House Select Committee on Government Efficiency that by the time President Trump’s executive orders on discrimination and DEI rolled out in January 2025, the system was ahead of the curve.
Goodson said each campus was advised on the remaining steps necessary to bring campuses into full compliance with the Trump administration’s orders.
“The guidance emphasizes the policies refocus on student success and reminds campuses of the constant, ongoing vigilance campuses must use,” said Goodson.
A memo from the system also mandated that all general education requirements that included completion of course credits related to diversity, equity and inclusion be suspended.
The system further mandated an annual campus reporting requirement with the chancellor’s signature to verify compliance.
To date, 59 positions tied to DEI have been eliminated and 131 have been realigned. The system estimates that the implementation of the equality policy across the University of North Carolina system has saved $17.1 million. The savings have been redirected to student mental health, military and veteran student services and academic advising, according to Goodson.
But efforts to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion from higher education in North Carolina have not been quick or easy.
“We’re turning over every stone,” Goodson told committee members.
The campuses have manually reviewed more than 4,756 web pages, revised 1,270 web pages, and reviewed over 8,000 gifts, including scholarships and grants. Of those gift funds, 345 were flagged, 29 amended, with some spending paused. Funding from 85 foundations required working with individual donors to bring agreements into compliance.
“It takes a lot of manpower and a lot of man hours to review this information,” Goodson told the committee. “It’s a time-consuming area.”
Rep. Mark Brody (R-Union) (Photo: NCGA livestream)
Rep. Mark Brody (R-Union) said he’d heard from upset constituents whose sons or daughters were not accepted at their school of choice in the UNC system.
“If there are foreign students in these programs, that means that there are slots available for U.S. citizens that should have those slots,” Brody said.
“Our in-state students come first, not out-of-state, not international,” Goodson assured Brody.
Chairman Rep. John Torbett (R-Gaston) worried about the expense of the effort to root out DEI.
“My concern is, how much money do we have to expend annually to try to ensure that people aren’t trying to skirt the law?” Torbett asked.
Goodson said the UNC System is not requesting additional funding for the scrutiny. “But this wasn’t a one-time exercise,” he cautioned. “This is now an annual process that our board trustees have to be involved in, our chancellors have to sign off on.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/UNC-CH_Photo_ClaytonHenkel_-1024x737.jpg,,,2026-01-08 09:11:41.415123

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)Another Democratic hopeful, Kalispell-based former firearms executive Ryan Busse, has joined the primary race for the chance to unseat incumbent U.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke. 
Busse, who ran an unsuccessful campaign to oust Gov. Greg Gianforte in 2024, announced today he is re-entering the political sphere with high confidence he can emerge victorious, in both a crowded primary field and in the general election. 
“We need to run somebody who’s run a big-time campaign, who’s done the work, and who’s proven they can raise the money,” Busse told the Daily Montanan. “I think I’m the best candidate for the primary, but, for me, this is about winning the general, and it’s about taking back the state.”
Busse’s first foray into politics was his gubernatorial race, but he had previously earned national attention from a book published in 2021 where he made the case that the firearms industry and the NRA are at the heart of the country’s political divide.
Republicans hold one of the slimmest margins in the House of Representatives in history, and recent vacancies due to resignations and deaths have further narrowed their advantage. 
That makes the 2026 elections even more crucial to both parties, as it will take just a handful of victories for Democrats to wrest control of the lower house, while Republicans need to shore up every advantage they have. 
In Montana, the state’s more competitive western district, rated a +5 Likely Republican election by the Cook Political Report, is drawing a lot of attention. (The state’s eastern district, represented by Rep. Troy Downing, is rated a +15 “Solid Republican.”)
Zinke won two elections in Montana as the state’s sole at-large representative before joining Trump’s cabinet in 2017. When the state split into two Congressional districts, Zinke ran for the western seat in 2022, winning by 3.5 percentage points. His re-election margin more than doubled 2024.
But that shift of voters towards the GOP — and the fact that a Democrat has not represented Montana in the House since 1997 — hasn’t stopped four Democrats from announcing bids for the western seat. 
On Monday, Missoula smokejumper and union leader Sam Forstag announced his candidacy for Zinke’s seat. 
The race already had two candidates who announced in 2025 — Matt Rains, of Simms, and Russ Cleveland, of St. Regis, who bring similar backgrounds as veterans and in agriculture to their campaigns. 
Busse said his decision to run came after polling data released by Tulchin Research, a California-based Democratic pollster, in recent weeks showed him with an early lead against Zinke.
While Busse said he did not pay for the polling, it was conducted to test the viability of a head-to-head matchup with Zinke and showed Busse with a 47-43 lead — within a margin of error of 4.76%— which goes up to an eight-point lead “after respondents were presented with balanced information about both candidates,” according to the poll summary. 
The poll, conducted among 424 likely voters in the district from Nov. 22-25, 2025, also showed Zinke has a net favorability rating of -7.
Notably, the poll did not ask respondents about a matchup between Zinke and a generic Democrat. 
“I can’t overemphasize how much this poll floored me — this is what we always hoped for in the gubernatorial race but never got,” Busse said. “I think this shows voters are ready for a change.”
In 2024, Busse earned just under 39% of the vote statewide in his loss to Gianforte, but earned roughly 43% of the vote in counties comprising the more moderate western district. However, in almost every western district county, Busse received fewer votes than Zinke’s 2024 challenger, Monica Tranel, who lost by eight points.
Despite the loss, Busse said he believes his campaign for governor gave him the name recognition and on-the-ground experience to reach voters, but that he understands it’s going to be a competitive race just to get through the primary. 
“I salute anybody who wants to put themselves on the line to take out Zinke and win the election,” Busse said. The crowded primary field “is what we anticipated, it’s how you know it’s a competitive seat.”
Similar to his gubernatorial campaign, Busse said affordability and public lands are two areas he wants to focus on.
The latter, especially, is likely to be a hot topic in the Congressional race, with Zinke’s background as a former Interior Secretary during President Donald Trump’s first term offering numerous policy stances for opponents to push against. 
Zinke has been a staunch champion for public land access over the last year, bucking his party to hold the line against federal land sales and co-founding the bipartisan Public Lands Caucus. 
“First off, I’m glad Zinke saw fit to finally vote for public lands,” Busse said. “But that’s pretty much showing up to work for Montanans. That should be the lowest of all bars to clear, but I do appreciate him doing it.”
In the last two races for the western district, a third-party candidate has received just over 3% of the vote.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/dems-govt-helena-110424-19-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-08 09:11:41.415123

(Photo by Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)A South Dakota board has approved the issuance of up to $200 million in bonds for Rapid City-based Monument Health to support expansions and upgrades, as its rival Sanford Health builds a new hospital in Rapid City.
The South Dakota Health and Educational Facilities Authority voted in December to authorize the bond package for Monument. 
The authority is governed by a seven-member board appointed by the governor. The state created the authority in 1972 to issue tax-exempt bonds that help nonprofit hospitals and public universities borrow money at lower cost. Investors buy the bonds and earn interest as the borrower pays back the debt. The aim is to give South Dakota residents greater access to education and health care.
Sanford Health plans to build Rapid City medical center with $300 million gift

The tax-exempt status means the investors don’t have to pay taxes on the interest their bonds earn. That makes the bonds more attractive, in this instance helping Monument borrow the money at a lower interest rate.
Dustin Christopherson, assistant director of the authority, explained to South Dakota Searchlight in June that the board’s bond approvals do not involve public tax dollars, and the state has no financial responsibility for repaying the debt. The authority does not lend the state’s credit to borrowers. Instead, it acts as a conduit, allowing hospitals and universities to access the lower, tax-exempt interest rates.
Monument Health plans to use the bond proceeds for acquiring, constructing, renovating, expanding and equipping various health care facilities in the Black Hills region, according to a public notice of the bonding package. 
That includes up to $100 million for renovations, expansions and equipment at Monument Health’s Rapid City Hospital, where Monument plans to renovate and expand obstetrics, pediatrics, cardiovascular and clinical spaces. 
Up to $75 million is listed for the Monument Health Spearfish Hospital and clinic, including the construction of additional space for perioperative services, expansion of the existing emergency services and inpatient services space, and expansion of existing medical offices to include additional physician clinic space.

Other bigger items include up to $30 million for a new emergency hospital at 1911 E. Mall Drive in Rapid City, and up to $30 million for the Orthopedic & Specialty Hospital in Rapid City, including the construction and renovation of inpatient and outpatient spaces within the existing hospital and clinic facilities. 
The public notice for the bonding package lists $275 million worth of projects, but the total amount of bonding cannot exceed $200 million. 
“That provides the borrower with flexibility to finance more or less of a particular project but still limits the total amount of the borrowing,” Christopherson said in an emailed statement. 
The authority approved a $1 billion bonding package in June for numerous Sanford Health projects in South Dakota, North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Wyoming. In November, Sanford Health announced that it had received a $300 million gift from its namesake philanthropist, Denny Sanford, to support the construction of a 168-bed medical center in Rapid City.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_5999-scaled-e1717896387737-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-08 09:11:41.415123

The move is intended to simplify California’s convoluted education governance, which policy analysts have said can be inefficient, redundant and sometimes at cross purposes.


Gov. Gavin Newsom on Thursday proposed paring down the responsibilities of California’s elected State Superintendent of Public Instruction and shifting more power to the State Board of Education.
“California can no longer postpone reforms that have been recommended regularly for a century,” Newsom said, referring to numerous reports over the years that have suggested streamlining the state’s system of K-12 school governance. 
“These critical reforms will bring greater accountability, clarity and coherence to how we serve our students and schools,” Newsom said.
The move is intended to simplify California’s convoluted education governance, which policy analysts have said can be inefficient, redundant and sometimes at cross purposes. 
Under his proposal, the State Board of Education, an 11-member body appointed by the governor, would take over the California Department of Education. The State Superintendent of Public Instruction would have broader responsibility to “foster coordination and alignment of state education policies from early childhood through post secondary education.” The proposal didn’t offer further details.
For more than a century, the state’s public K-12 schools have been governed by a web of authorities, both locally and at the state level. In Sacramento, the governor, state superintendent, State Board of Education and the Legislature all share policy-making duties, which may shift every few years depending on the political winds. The Department of Education, under the direction of the state superintendent, is supposed to carry out those policies.
Locally, school boards and county offices of education also hold power over schools, especially since the state switched to a funding system about a decade ago that gives more flexibility to school districts. County offices, among other duties, are charged with overseeing school district budgets.
California has a somewhat unique system of school governance. It’s one of only nine states that elects a schools chief. In other states, the top schools officer is appointed by the governor or the board of education, according to research by Education Commission of the States.
Newsom’s proposal echoes a December report by Policy Analysis for California Education which called for an overhaul of the state’s school governance structure. 
“The need for stronger, more coherent governance has never been greater. Schools are grappling with fiscal challenges alongside deepening inequities, persistent opportunity gaps, and the lasting impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on student learning and well-being,” the report’s authors wrote.
The issue is especially urgent, they said, as the federal government reels back its involvement in K-12 schools. President Donald Trump is in the process of shuttering the federal Department of Education, spinning off its duties to the states and other federal agencies. Federal education funding is also increasingly precarious, giving states more direct responsibility for educating children.
The PACE authors suggested several solutions, including the proposal that Newsom put forth. Under the PACE recommendation, the Department of Education would be run by an administrator appointed by the State Board of Education, and the superintendent would act as an independent advocate, with an eye on accountability. Most of the power and responsibility for schools would lie with the governor.
Previous proposals
This is not the first time the issue has arisen. Several ballot measures over the years — none successful — have sought to change the role of the state superintendent. In 2023, ACA 9, by former Assemblyman Kevin McCarty, a Democrat from Sacramento, would have made the position appointed by the governor. McCarty withdrew it amid opposition from the California Teachers Association, the California School Boards Association and other groups.
In his proposal, Newsom cited other previous reports recommending changes to state schools governance, including one from 2002 and another from 1920.
The state’s current superintendent, Tony Thurmond, is winding down his second term. During his tenure, the department has expanded literacy efforts, community schools, student wellness programs and other initiatives. He’s also faced criticism for working side jobs and creating a “toxic workplace.”
Thurmond, who terms out in 2026, is running for governor.
Newsom’s proposal has backing from a wide array of education players, including the Association of California School Administrators, California Association of School Business Officials, Californians Together, which advocates for English learners, and EdTrust-West, a research and advocacy organization focused on equity.
”For far too long, California’s fractured education governance system has contributed to persistent inequities disproportionately impacting low-income students, students of color and multilingual learners,” said Christopher Nellum, executive director of EdTrust-West. “EdTrust-West commends Governor Newsom for championing these essential reforms.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/033122-San-Antonio-Elementary-School-DR-CM-01-1.jpg?fit=1024%2C705&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-08 09:11:41.415123

From CalMatters local news fellow Cayla Mihalovich:
California Democrats passed a batch of bills in 2025 to push back against President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown, and new ones are in the works at the start of this year.
On Tuesday Sen. Eloise Gómez Reyes, a Democrat from San Bernardino, introduced legislation to prevent federal immigration agents from making “unannounced and indiscriminate” arrests in courthouses, which have become a battleground for the Trump administration to carry out its aggressive deportation tactics.

Gómez Reyes, in a statement: “The issue is clear cut. One of the core responsibilities of government is to protect people — not to inflict terror on them. California is not going to let the federal government make political targets out of people trying to be good stewards of the law. Discouraging people from coming to court makes our community less safe.”

The proposed legislation comes nearly two weeks after a federal judge ordered that the U.S. Justice Department halt civil arrests in immigration courts across Northern California, ruling that its deportation policies hadn’t addressed the “chilling effects, safety risks, and impacts on hearing attendance.” 
More bills: Other legislators introduced new measures this week, including:

Political violence: Prompted by the separate killings of conservative activist Charlie Kirk and Democratic Minnesota lawmaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, a bill by Assemblymember Laurie Davies, an Oceanside Republican, would add political affiliation to the list of characteristics needed to classify a crime as a hate crime.


Data privacy: Backed by Consumer Reports and the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a bill by Assemblymember Chris Ward would prohibit data brokers from selling sensitive user information including immigration status, sexual orientation and genetic information. The proposal builds on two other data protection bills by the San Diego Democrat that’s currently before the Legislature.


Solar energy: A proposal by Democratic Sen. Scott Wiener of San Francisco would cut red tape for Californians who want to install plug-in solar energy systems — smaller, more portable systems that residents can position on their balconies, patios or other locations.

‘License to Kill’ investigation leads to legislation

A coalition of lawmakers is planning a series of bills this legislative session to fundamentally revamp how California handles dangerous drivers. 
The action comes in response to License to Kill, a CalMatters investigation that revealed how the state of California has routinely allowed dangerous drivers with horrifying histories to continue driving and killing.
Assemblymember Nick Schultz of Burbank, a Democrat who is the chairperson of the Assembly’s Public Safety Committee, proposed a law Monday that would increase penalties for repeat drunk drivers. 
He said the bill is intended to be the “tip of the spear” in a larger movement. 

Schultz, in an interview: “California has been behind the eight ball, quite frankly, compared to many other states in the country. We have got to do a better job.”

Details of other road safety bills are expected to be unveiled in the coming weeks.

State Senator Benjamin Allen, a Democrat from Santa Monica, is running for Insurance Commissioner


With the first anniversary of the devastating Southern California wildfires approaching, CalMatters asked candidates for the 2026 state Insurance Commissioner race to share thoughts on what the state can do to help victims and stabilize insurers. This is the second response. Read the other candidate response here.
The messages started flowing in: A fast-moving fire was tearing through the Palisades. Families I grew up with and had represented in the State Senate for more than a decade were told to evacuate with just minutes’ notice. We had just started the new legislative session up in Sacramento, but I knew I needed to get back home.
As I headed into town, the sky was lit up by the fire. The blaze was bright, red and hot. The smoke plume stretched for miles. We evacuated my mom, packed a go bag, and figured out contingency plans.
On the ground, it felt like a war zone. Ash coated the streets. The toxic smell of burned homes lingered everywhere. People stood outside evacuation centers staring at their phones, hoping for news that would tell them whether they still had a home to return to.
In the days that followed, my office was flooded with calls. Homeowners. Renters. Seniors on fixed incomes. People in mobile home parks who had lost everything and feared not only rebuilding costs, but losing their property rights altogether. 
Again and again, I heard the same questions: Will my insurance pay? How long will this take? What happens if it doesn’t? 
I got a front row seat to the dysfunction of our current insurance system. Our work went from helping people in the immediate aftermath of the fire to thinking about broader policy changes. This visceral experience of what so many of my friends, neighbors and constituents went through drove me to run for California Insurance Commissioner.
In the California State Senate, I’ve built a reputation for tackling difficult problems, and perhaps no problem in our state is as vexing as fixing our insurance system. It’s a system under severe strain, with the consequences falling hardest on those least able to absorb them.
Stabilizing the market, protecting ratepayers, and fixing the FAIR Plan are not abstract policy goals. They are essential if California is going to remain a place where people can live safely and securely. The current trajectory of the system threatens the future of our quality of life. And God forbid a disaster strikes, California must be a place where people can recover afterwards, rather than be forced out.
Stabilize the insurance market
Insurers need certainty to operate in California. Today, insurance companies wait years to get answers from the state, which creates instability that drives them to limit coverage or exit the market altogether.
We need to modernize how the state reviews insurance rates while preserving strong consumer protections. That means allowing responsible use of modern tools to predict wildfire risk and account for the actual cost of coverage, while dramatically speeding up state timelines so decisions are made in months, not years.
Faster does not mean weaker. It means clearer standards, better data and accountability on all sides. Stability also requires reducing real-world risk. Fireproofing works, but insurers price risk at the community level. 
As Insurance Commissioner, I would push for neighborhood-scale fire prevention and risk reduction programs that lower losses across entire communities and make it possible for insurers to responsibly write policies again. Many parts of the state are already implementing these programs, and they’re working. We need to scale these — and quickly.
Protect consumers
Californians are already facing unaffordable housing, utilities and insurance. They deserve confidence that every rate increase is justified and transparent. California law gives the Insurance Commissioner power to reject unfair rate hikes, and I will use that authority aggressively.
Protecting ratepayers also means standing up for people after disasters. After the Palisades Fire, I saw families forced to navigate slow and opaque claims systems while trying to rebuild their lives. That is why I wrote the law requiring insurers to provide significantly higher upfront payments for personal property when a home is a total loss, rather than forcing survivors to itemize every possession. 
We know we must do more. Among many things, we are currently looking into legislation that would create greater clarity and certainty with certain types of insurance coverage, including smoke damage post-fire.
Reform FAIR Plan
The FAIR Plan, the state’s backup insurer of last resort, was meant to be temporary but has tripled in size to now cover 450,000 residential policyholders. The program is driving up costs for all Californians who are being asked to bail it out.
In the short term, the FAIR Plan must be solvent and able to pay claims promptly, with improved governance and transparency. 
In the long term, it must shrink. Homeowners who invest in making their homes safer should have a real path back into the private market with assurances they can regain coverage if their communities become fire safe.  We also shouldn’t be building uninsurable new developments that are simply destined for the FAIR Plan and further public bailouts.
Standing in the Palisades, surrounded by smoke and uncertainty, it was clear what failure looks like. Insurance is not just a financial product; it is the foundation of recovery. Stabilizing the market, protecting ratepayers, and fixing the FAIR Plan are hard challenges, but they are solvable.

A tool called DROP lets California residents fill out a few forms to keep their personal data from being tracked or sold by data brokers.


The California Privacy Protection Agency kicked off 2026 by launching a tool that state residents can use to make data brokers delete and stop selling their personal information. 
The system, known as the Delete Request and Opt-out Platform, or DROP, has been in the works for years, mandated by a 2023 law known as the Delete Act. Under it and previous laws, data brokers must register with the state and enable consumers to tell brokers to stop tracking them and selling their information. 
Until now, those instructions had to be delivered to each data broker individually — not an easy feat, given that more than 500 brokers were registered in the state as of the end of last year. Making things even more difficult, some brokers obscured their opt-out forms from search results, as The Markup and CalMatters revealed in August. 
The new system delivers privacy instructions to every registered broker at once. Launched on January 1, it is open to all California residents. By law, the hundreds of data brokers registered with the state must begin processing those requests in August.
Here’s how to take advantage of it.
Finding your advertising IDs
DROP asks you to provide some basic information — your name, email address, phone number, and zip code — so data brokers can find you in their systems. You can submit the form with just this information, but if you’d like a more thorough deletion, you can also provide your mobile advertising IDs from your phones, smart TVs, and vehicles. Including these IDs can help brokers match more of your data, but you have to take the time to collect them. 
Click here to jump ahead if you want to provide basic information only, or continue reading for instructions on providing mobile advertising IDs for:

Android phones and tablets
Apple iPhones and iPads
Vehicle ID numbers and smart TVs
Personal computers

Android phones and tablets
The steps below may vary slightly depending on your device and operating system version, but the general process is the same:

Open Settings.
At the top of the Settings screen, select the menu option with your name, followed by “Google services and preferences.”
Select the All services tab.
Scroll to the Privacy & Security section, and select Ads. Scroll to the bottom of that screen to get your advertising ID, which will look like a string of random numbers and letters separated by four hyphens. Save that ID for the DROP form.

On the same screen, you can find options to reset or delete your advertising ID. The CCPA suggests resetting your ID “because it breaks the persistent tracking link that advertisers, data brokers, and apps use to build long-term behavioral profiles of your device.” Alternatively, deleting the ID should prevent ID-based data tracking from happening at all.

Apple iPhones and iPads
Apple doesn’t provide a way for iOS users to see their mobile advertising ID, which it calls the Identifier for Advertisers, or IDFA. But it does provide a way for users to prevent trackers from accessing these IDs.
To turn off tracking, first, adjust your Screen Time settings:

Open Settings. 
Scroll down and select Screen Time. 
Scroll down and select Content & Privacy Restrictions. 
Scroll down and select Allow Apps to Request to Track.
Select Don’t Allow Changes. 

Then, adjust your Tracking settings:

Open Settings. 
Scroll down and select Privacy & Security. 
Select Tracking.
Toggle OFF the option to Allow Apps to Request to Track.

Apple has its own ads system that doesn’t use an IDFA. To disable that: 

Open Settings. 
Scroll down and select Privacy & Security. 
Scroll down and select Apple Advertising.
Toggle OFF the Personalized Ads option.

A quick note for our technically savvy readers: If you’ve already turned tracking off, you might be tempted to turn it back on to look up your advertising ID using a third-party app, but it’s unnecessary. Re-enabling tracking will reset the ID, limiting its usefulness to data brokers — they can’t continue tracking data or delivering personalized ads using a device ID that no longer exists. 
Vehicle ID numbers and smart TVs
Vehicles can track their owners in surprisingly invasive ways, and you can provide a vehicle’s identification number, or VIN, in case data brokers have that information. Where your VIN is will depend on the vehicle, but common places include on the dash on the driver’s side, or on a sticker in the jamb of the front passenger door. Your vehicle registration documents should also have your VIN listed.
Smart TVs also use advertising IDs. Here’s a guide that provides some settings for common brands. If the guide doesn’t cover your smart TV, try checking under its privacy or advertising settings. But be aware that this is different from numbers like the model code and serial number.
Personal computers
Laptop and desktop computers use unique identifiers to share data, but these are harder to find than mobile advertising IDs. Instead, you can turn off tracking, which will delete those IDs. (Turning tracking on again will generally reset the IDs.)

On computers running Windows, you can turn off your advertising ID by going to Settings. Depending on your OS version, select Privacy or Privacy & security. Then select General, and adjust your settings there.
On Mac computers, navigate to System Settings > Privacy & Security > Apple Advertising. Then, toggle off Personalized Ads.

The California Privacy Protection Agency also provides some of its own guidance on finding advertising IDs. 
Verify your identity
Go to the DROP website. You’ll be asked to accept the terms of use and be directed to a page that asks you to prove you’re a California resident. There are two ways to do so, and you can’t change methods once you’ve selected one of them. 

The system allows you to verify your identity using personal information through a system called the California Identity Gateway. If you select this option, you’ll be asked to provide some basic personal information, like a phone number, email address, California address, or your social security number. The gateway will use this information to attempt to verify your residency directly with the state. This option should be quick if you have an email address and phone number.
Alternatively, you can verify your identity to DROP using login.gov, a system that some federal and state agencies in the United States have adopted to allow residents to interact with government services. To sign up for a login.gov account, you’ll be asked to provide an email address, create a password, and provide photos of government-issued identification. After signing up and verifying your identity, you should be able to move on to the next step. This option might take a little more effort than the first option, since ID is required, but might be faster if you’ve already signed up for an account for other purposes.

Fill out and submit the DROP form
After verifying your identity, you’ll get to a form where you can submit multiple versions of your name, up to three zip codes, up to three email addresses, up to three phone numbers, advertising IDs from your mobile devices and smart TVs, and VINs for your vehicles. You’ll be asked to verify your email addresses and phone numbers with single-use codes before submitting. (The agency notes there may be delays with some verification codes due to high volume.)
A form on California’s DROP website. CalMatters
Once you submit the form, you’ll get a unique DROP ID to check the status of your request.
What happens now?
Sit back and wait. While the window for making DROP requests has opened, data brokers registered with the state aren’t required to handle them just yet. On August 1, brokers will begin processing the requests.
Starting then, companies have 45 days to process requests and 90 days to report back on how they handled requests. If they fail to do so, the companies can face financial penalties. 
In the meantime, you can monitor the status of your request with your DROP ID. At some point later in the year, when you log in the system should tell you whether your data was successfully deleted, whether records on you weren’t found, or whether companies believed the data was exempt from deletion under the law, which provides some limited ways for brokers to hold on to data.  
If you find more information while you’re waiting for your request to be processed, like a new mobile advertising ID, you can update your request with that information, increasing the odds you’ll successfully get your data deleted.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DROP-SYSTEM-Illos010526-DROP-SYSTEM-CM-GH.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-08 08:58:44.286455

Faculty representation at Cal State is lagging far behind the growing number of Latino students. That burdens the small circles of Latino faculty who take on more mentorship tasks, many times in non-tenure positions and for lower pay.


In the last decade, Latinos in the California State University system have not made up more than 15% of all instructors, even as they made up nearly half of the student body in recent years.
Even at Cal State Los Angeles, where in 2024 a massive 75% of its student population were Latino, only about a quarter of its faculty were, according to Cal State data compiled by CalMatters.The number of Latino students has been growing at a faster pace, with all but one of the 22 Cal State campuses qualifying as Hispanic Serving Institutions — meaning at least 25% of full-time undergraduates are Latino, and a majority are low-income. Some Latino instructors say they carry additional weight where their small cadres are disproportionately sought out by Latino students for mentoring. This can also fall on the shoulders of part-time and full-time lecturers, who make up the bulk of Latino faculty, but are on a lower pay scale – even those who work full-time and take on extra duties.
“When you’re able to see Latinos that look like you, that maybe have the same starting point, lived experience as you, you’re able to see what is possible,” said Feliza Ortiz-Licon, who has long worked with first-generation college students and is now executive vice president of the Campaign for College Opportunity, a California nonprofit that advocates for equitable college access and completion.
Faculty say critical barriers into entering teaching include limited mentorship and lax promotion of programs that support them getting their doctoral degrees. Further, these programs offer limited spots. Underlying cultural norms have also dissuaded generations of Latinos from stepping into academia. Cal State campuses have continued their efforts to diversify the faculty, such as conducting cluster hires where groups of faculty are hired for their specific areas of expertise and backgrounds.
Still, these efforts have done little to increase the number of Latino faculty. 
As an example, in fall 2024, Cal State had 27,505 instructors but only 4,079 of them were Latino. To meet parity with the number of Latino students, the system would have needed 13,477 Latino educators.

Why are there so few Latinos in academia?
Amy Bentley-Smith, Cal State’s spokesperson, points to low national numbers of Latinos entering graduate programs. In 2023, Latinos represented only about 14% of graduate students nationwide, according to a Council of Graduate Schools report.
CalMatters attempted to speak with multiple officials at the Cal State Chancellor’s Office but the spokesperson said they were unavailable to be interviewed for this story. Instead, Bentley-Smith emailed the following response:“We have long been a leader in opening doors to opportunity and increasing access to higher education among all Californians, including historically under-represented populations,” Bentley-Smith wrote.She added that Cal State consistently exceeds the national percentage of Hispanic faculty — who made up about 6% of all full-timers in 2023, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.
Among the few Latinos with advanced degrees, 10% have earned a doctorate-level degree, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of 2021 American Community Survey data. A master’s is usually required to teach as a lecturer at a Cal State, and a doctorate is typically needed for a tenure-track professor position.In its research over the years, the Campaign for College Opportunity has attributed Latinos’ low educational attainment to high poverty rates, pressures to work and support family, and a lack of access to resources and information on navigating higher education.

And then there’s imposter syndrome. Since beginning her work as an academic advisor at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo’s business college, Yesenia Marquez-Beas has seen countless students walk through her door feeling unworthy of success in the classroom. She finds those doubts to be far more common among Latino students than others.
“Maybe our Latinidad is holding us back a little bit to go out and seek positions that we see so far away,” Marquez-Beas said. 
Progressing through academia into teaching is rarely a part of the conversation when it comes to pathways after graduation, said Marquez-Beas.
Many Latinos live by certain cultural norms, Ortiz-Licon of the Campaign for College Opportunity pointed out. ‘No quiero molestar’ is one, which translates to “I don’t want to bother.” The approach keeps students reluctant to seek help or mentors, Ortiz-Licon said, once a first-generation student herself.
Anthonio Reyes, the president of Cal State Bakersfield’s student government, agreed that many first-generation Latino students have a “bad habit” of not speaking up about their issues. After high school in Bakersfield, Reyes attended San Francisco State, where he felt isolated and unable to seek help from his professors.“That’s a huge thing in the community, you just don’t ask for help,” said Reyes.
Reyes’ second year at San Francisco State was interrupted by COVID, when he went home and started working instead. He worked for four years before enrolling at Cal State Bakersfield to study music, where he found a more supportive environment.
That’s why as student government president, Reyes often tells campus leaders that they have to be proactive about helping first-generation students.
Shortfall creates additional weight on Latino faculty
As students tend to seek out educators of similar backgrounds, the gap creates a larger workload for a small circle of these instructors of color to address. And lecturers might take that on despite it not being in their job description.
“There’s a lot of cultural taxation. That’s the biggest problem with a lack of diversity in higher education, the diverse faculty take on more work,” said Dirk Horn, a Latino political science lecturer at Cal State BakersfieldThat can also bottleneck support for some mentees, eager to find someone culturally relatable.

“I have like a total of two Latino mentors that I’ve ever had, and I’m trying to build a connection with another one but she’s just so busy,” said Isabella Cantu, a Latina doctoral student studying sociology at UC Davis in hopes of someday joining the Cal State faculty.
José Navarro, chair of the ethnic studies department at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, believed as a student that education could be transformative but that pursuing higher education was like “walking into a really, really, really dark room” that he could not navigate on his own. 
As a tenured faculty, Navarro serves as an academic advisor and mentor on top of teaching. While at times he works late nights or from home, Navarro sees it more an act of necessity than a burden.
“The last thing I want is for some student of color to come in, just like I was, into that completely dark room that is the university system,” Navarro said. 
‘El muerto entre muchos no pesa,’ Navarro said, translating to, “a dead man among many does not weigh heavily.” He said that’s how he feels at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, where Latino representation is limited, but the weight of service and mentorship is lighter when others are there to support.   
Latinos at Cal State are less likely to be in tenure-track positions, which are expected to be involved with academic advising and research. Latinos made up 12% of tenure-track faculty in fall 2024 while whites made up more than half. Yet, whites made up 20% of Cal State’s student population.
Tenure-track professors shape major university university decisions such as evaluating faculty hiring and promotion. They also have greater job security, Navarro said. Meanwhile, full-time lecturers are paid less and have a greater teaching workload.

But lecturers like Horn keep their doors open for their pupils voluntarily.
Horn assists the campus’ Academic Senate, serves on committees, and advises student clubs on campus, all without additional compensation. Without the possibility of tenure, Horn also feels uncertainty about his job security. He tracks state budgets and enrollment rates to assess the odds — in a fiscal deficit, would he be laid off first?
Getting more Latinos into academia
“I think more than anything, mentorship is important,” said Cantu, the UC Davis student. “Not just seeing the representation but feeling that support and having someone who understands your background, understands where you’re coming from.”
She credits mentorship she received from a national program, the Mellon Mays Undergraduate Fellowship, for giving her the push to become a professor. She is now a fellow with the Chancellor’s Doctoral Incentive Program, one of two Cal State programs that help aspiring faculty obtain advanced degrees.
Horn, the Cal State Bakersfield lecturer, was also in the doctoral incentive program. It provided him with funds to focus on school while pursuing his doctorate at UC Irvine.
His journey to earning a doctorate degree was a rocky one. His father expected Horn to contribute to the family financially, so rather than enroll in high school, he worked full time while attending continuation school to obtain his GED.Five years after receiving his GED, when his father’s health was declining, Horn realized that a college degree might bring him — and his family — more financial stability. He attended community college and then transferred to Cal State Bakersfield, where he found mentors who encouraged him to attend graduate school.

Horn postponed graduating to join the federally funded Ronald E. McNair Post-baccalaureate Achievement Program, which helps prepare first-generation and underrepresented students for graduate studies.
Out of the 35 students accepted into Cal State’s doctoral incentive program this academic year, 54% are Latino, 24% Asian, 19% white and 3% Black, according to Bentley-Smith. The program offers mentorship, access to grants and financial awards worth thousands of dollars and professional opportunities for students pursuing a doctorate. They can also receive an optional loan that is forgiven if the fellow is an instructor at Cal State. Of the past program fellows, 69% earned faculty positions at Cal State campuses after earning their doctorate degrees.
Cluster hires help boost diversity — when there’s funding
Some Cal State campuses, such as Bakersfield and San Luis Obispo, have practiced cluster hiring to boost diversity among faculty. The process involves recruiting whole pools of faculty with diverse expertise and backgrounds. Ortiz-Licon, the higher education researcher, argues that such hiring of diverse groups “in community” increases their sense of belonging to their respective campuses, as well as strengthens retention of these educators for the long haul.
In fall, Sacramento State implemented its first cluster hire directly aimed at supporting Latino students. That semester, 37% of students there were Latino while 10% of faculty were Latino, according to the university’s institutional research database.
Rebecca Cameron, interim vice provost for faculty success at Sacramento State, said the university sought out faculty who had backgrounds in mentoring, teaching and researching Latino populations.
While Sacramento State hired 10 faculty across various departments, Cameron said two of the new hires for tenure-track positions previously held lecturer positions at the university.
Cameron emphasized the need to retain new cluster hires as sometimes she’s observed that faculty who are the first of a particular group in a department might get burnt out.
“It also continues to be really important that we not leave the work of inclusion [solely] to people who’ve identified a specific interest in it,” Cameron said.

In short, is Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass doing enough to rebuild from the blazes?
To answer the question, it’s worth starting with one obvious but unusual fact: The Palisades and Eaton fires were, in one sense, identical, in that they erupted at the same moment, under the same weather conditions and just a few miles apart. 
But they are, in another important sense, opposite, in that the Palisades lie within the mayor’s jurisdiction and the Eaton fire outside it. That should help dispense with one critique of Bass, the argument that these fires could have been throttled in their earliest moments if only for swift action by city leaders, or that Los Angeles was singularly unprepared. 
If that were true, Altadena would still be standing, since it lies outside the orbit of LA’s leadership. The devastating damage to two areas with different political structures proves that political leadership was not to blame.
The same is true for the specious argument that a reservoir that was offline for repairs near the Palisades would have saved the area from disaster. The real problem with fighting the fires a year ago was high winds, which grounded planes and helicopters, not a lack of water supply — which was confirmed by a state analysis of the response and by firefighters on the ground. 
If the reservoir’s status at the time of the fire did not contribute to the actual damage, it did offer the mayor’s critics a political line of attack, which they grabbed even as the fires still smoldered. 
Rick Caruso, the developer whom Bass beat in 2022, latched onto the issue, but it was just a grasp for advantage and was — or should have been — beneath his intelligence. He continues his quest to be mentioned in stories about the campaigns for mayor and governor, considering each even as the political tide moves away from him.
Forces of nature
LA Times owner Patrick Soon-Shiong also tried to make hay of it, only to be contradicted by his own newspaper’s reporting on the issue. Soon-Shiong has since retreated from public commentary on the fires and their aftermath; his public pledge to create a Leadership Council disappeared without a trace. 
Wind and brush are forces of nature, not politics, and absolve Bass of responsibility for the fires. Karen Bass is no more responsible for the Palisades fire than former mayors Richard Riordan was for the Northridge Earthquake or Eugene Schmitz for the San Francisco earthquake and fire of 1906. They prove nothing more than that disasters are a fact of California history.
That said, mayors and other political leaders can and should be held accountable for how those under their direction respond in the aftermath of catastrophe. 
Again, comparing Altadena and the Palisades is illustrative:
A recent UCLA study concluded that 70% of homes badly damaged in the Eaton fire show no signs of moving toward reconstruction, and while about half of rebuilding permits filed so far had been approved, more than 25% were on hold. 
From the Palisades, meanwhile, the city has received more than 3,000 permit applications, has approved plans for more than 1,700 and issued permits for about 1,400. As with Altadena, that leaves many still under review, some 1,200 in the case of the city.

Broadly speaking, the city of Los Angeles is issuing permits in the Palisades somewhat faster than county officials are for Altadena, according to an analysis by the Los Angeles Times, which pegged the city’s average turnaround at 79 days and the county’s at 131 days. 
In other areas, the city’s response has failed to inspire much confidence. The city’s fire chief was quick to distance herself from the fire’s devastation, laying blame on others before being fired by Bass last year. 
And efforts to produce an after-action analysis of the event have been undermined by reports pointing to editing that softened some of the document’s language and conclusions. Some of the changes appear cosmetic, others more substantive. 
Despite the ultimate report being “watered down,” it presented a menu of reforms to better prepare the city for the next flareup. Some have already been implemented. 
For Bass, then, the political challenge ahead is twofold: to persuade voters that her early stumbles did not materially affect the city’s response and to demonstrate that the city has command of the process now. 
In that vein, her administration is attempting to present itself as transparent: The city has made public copies of the after-action report and the drafts that led up to it, and a city website charts progress toward rebuilding with regular, sometime hourly, updates. 
But reassurance is likely to be measured by optics as much as data. By fall, will the Palisades feel like a community regaining its strength, or will it remain hollowed out and empty? That, more than anything, may deliver the political verdict on this grave civic tragedy.
As for the judgments of history, they are mixed.
Mayor Riordan was widely praised for his response to the Northridge quake, and his steady resolve in those months helped fashion his image as a practical and, at least occasionally, effective problem solver. 
For Mayor Schmitz, the San Francisco quake left a different lasting impression. He ordered police to shoot looters on sight and reached outside the government for leadership in rebuilding the city. He was indicted the following year for corruption, and though ultimately acquitted, he never regained his former standing in the life of his city.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111225-Karen-Bass-Palisades-TS-AP-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-08 08:58:44.286455

The DUI bill is intended to be the “tip of the spear” in a movement to address how California allows dangerous drivers to stay on the roads. 



A coalition of lawmakers is planning a series of bills this Legislative session to fundamentally revamp how California handles dangerous drivers, Assemblymember Nick Schultz of Burbank said this week.
Schultz, a Democrat who chairs the Assembly’s Public Safety Committee, released the details of his opening effort on Monday, proposing a law that would increase penalties for repeat drunk drivers. 
He said the bill is intended to be the “tip of the spear” in a larger movement to address issues exposed by CalMatters’ License to Kill series. The investigation showed how, as roadway deaths spike, the state of California has routinely allowed dangerous drivers with horrifying histories to continue to operate on our roads.
“California has been behind the eight ball, quite frankly, compared to many other states in the country,” Schultz said in an interview. “We have got to do a better job.”
His new bill would make it easier for prosecutors to charge repeat DUI offenders with a felony, punish some of those drivers with longer license suspensions and lengthen their usage of ignition interlock devices, which are in-car breathalyzers that a driver must blow into for a vehicle to start. 
The proposed changes come after alcohol-related roadway deaths in California surged more than 50% over the past decade — an increase twice as steep as the rest of the country, federal estimates show. More than 1,300 people die each year statewide in drunken collisions.  CalMatters’ investigation revealed the state has some of the weakest DUI laws in the country and fails to enforce many of the statutes that are on the books.
Here, for example, a driver generally can’t be charged with a felony until their fourth DUI in 10 years. Schultz’s bill would let prosecutors charge a felony for a third DUI — a “paradigm shift” for sentencing, he said, that would bring California more in line with other states like Oregon, where he used to work as a prosecutor handling DUI cases.
The bill would also require any driver who gets a fifth DUI conviction within 10 years to have their license revoked for five years, and to install an in-car breathalyzer for four years. 
Schultz said the measure, and those expected to follow, would give the state a better system to identify dangerous drivers and intervene before it’s too late. His goal is to “bridge the gap” between the justice system and state regulators at the DMV. The effort was spurred, he added, by a combination of victims’ families calling for change and CalMatters’ reporting. 
“It’s grassroots, and I’m hearing about it in my community,” Schultz said. “The Capitol community is paying more attention to it because of the investigative reporting, and I think that’s a good thing.”

Other lawmakers are researching ways to keep reckless drivers off the road for longer, increase penalties for hit and runs and deadly DUIs, further expand breathalyzer requirements and modify the DMV’s point system. That system is set up to identify short-term clusters of dangerous behavior behind the wheel as opposed to long-term patterns. As a result, some drivers with egregious records are able to stay on the road.
Separately, Republican Assemblymember Tom Lackey of Palmdale plans on bringing at least three DUI reform bills in the upcoming session, according to his office.
Details of other road safety bills are expected to be announced in the coming weeks, staffers say, and will include a push for more DMV funding to address cost concerns. California was once a leader on these issues, but elected officials have proven reluctant to take on traffic deaths at a time when they’ve prioritized criminal justice reform and economic inequality, and the DMV has said it doesn’t have the resources to implement changes. 
The pendulum may be swinging. After recent high-profile crashes, officials and advocates across the state are amplifying calls to address dangerous driving. 
Last spring, high school tennis standout Braun Levi was killed by someone prosecutors say was a repeat drunk driver, just months after his family’s home burned in the Palisades fire. 
District Attorney Nathan Hochman last month filed murder charges against the driver and held a press conference calling on the Legislature, governor, DMV and judges to do more to avoid similar deaths.
Hochman highlighted many of the findings from the CalMatters series, noting that vehicular manslaughter isn’t considered a violent felony in California and referencing the fact that it’s one of the few states that don’t require first-time DUI offenders to install in-car breathalyzers.
“What other issue do we have where we actually have preventable deaths that we absolutely know will occur if we just keep doing the status quo?” Hochman said.
State Sen. Bob Archuleta, a Democrat from Norwalk and member of the Senate Transportation Committee, joined Hochman at the podium. Archuleta’s granddaughter was killed by an alleged drunk driver in 2024, and he has said he intends to put forward legislation to increase consequences for fatal DUI crashes.
“My colleagues in the state Senate, my colleagues in the Assembly, please work with us,” Archuleta said. “Because we’ve got to do some things that are gonna shake the trees a little bit.”
Braun’s mother, Jennifer Levi, made an appeal for more action at the press conference.
“California’s current DUI laws are broken and weak and fail to protect families like ours, and it’s devastating,” Levi said. “His death haunts my every breath, my every day.”
She said she’s committed to advancing legislation to restructure DUI sentencing and increase deterrence and punishment. Archuleta’s office said it’s finishing a draft of such a bill.
“This is not a political issue, this is a human issue,” Levi said. “I guarantee if any of you had to identify the body of your child or loved one in the manner that my husband and I did a few months ago, you would not be silent.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/111625-Traffic-Vigil-FG-CM-25.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-08 08:58:44.286455

Ash rained down and smoke blanketed Los Angeles during the 2025 wildfires, leaving behind a toxic legacy in soil and homes. Without a federal or California mandate, nonprofit, academic and local groups offer testing for homeowners. 


As the Palisades and Eaton fires burned last January, and for weeks afterward, clouds of ash blanketed the city. Contained in that ash were  microscopic bits of heavy metals and synthetic chemicals from the homes that were consumed in the megafires. The Los Angeles hazards aren’t unique: they’ve become part of the wildfire legacy in wildland-urban interfaces throughout California. 
Modern houses are full of synthetic chemicals found in everything from paints and finishes, to electronics and upholstered furniture, to cookware. After the Camp Fire, a California Air Resources Board analysis in 2021 traced heavy metals like arsenic and lead that traveled in smoke from Chico all the way to San Jose. Last year, both in Los Angeles County’s fire-scarred neighborhoods and downwind of them, people wondered what exactly was in their gardens, yards, sandboxes and playgrounds – and raised questions about how risky it is to interact with the environment after a major wildfire. 
Yet FEMA, the California Environmental Protection Agency, and L.A. County chose not to perform soil testing. FEMA instead ordered that the top few inches of soil be removed from burned properties. Local government and non-governmental organizations stepped in to provide testing and education, but no clear standard for testing soil or cleaning up homes safely exists. 
Here are the answers to questions frequently asked by fire survivors as well as those who’ve experienced their fallout. 
Why isn’t there a safe standard for testing soil or homes? 
No federal or California mandate establishes one. FEMA had a policy of collecting soil samples to test for hazardous chemicals, but in 2020 reversed its routine. The agency made an exception in Hawaii in 2023, where there was a lack of baseline data about what was in the soil. 

How to obtain testing
CAP.LA will come to a property to do testing when a homeowner fills out this form and they say they give results in about a month. 
Residents can mail or drop off soil samples they collect for USC Clean’s project after they register online for an identifying number.
Separately, Los Angeles County Department of Public Health offers a drop-off soil testing program too, prioritized for people within the burn footprints of the fires in Pacific Palisades and Altadena.

Without federally-sponsored testing, local government, nonprofit and academic groups have stepped in: LA County Public Health set aside up to $3 million from their Lead Paint Hazard Mitigation Program to fund free soil lead testing for residents living within and downwind of the Eaton and Palisades Fires burn areas. The R&S Kayne foundation funded CAP.LA – the Community Action Project of Los Angeles – which connects people with free soil and water testing, as well as offering targeted advice for individual homeowners. Another soil testing project, USC Clean, is funded by significant grants from FireAid, a non-profit, along with support from L.A. Care, a public, locally-operated Medi-Cal managed care plan. 
What exactly goes into soils after a fire? 
Lots of substances get released when houses and cars burn, including plastics, chemicals, and metals. Metals can drop out of the ash and settle on soil, grass and trees – hanging around the local environment after structures burn. Lead may become airborne during a fire as toxic lead vapor or settle in ash and soil. That’s a worry because no safe exposure level to lead exists. Exposure to lead and other heavy metals can pose serious health risks, especially to children, pregnant individuals, seniors, and those with existing health conditions. When people touch contaminated soil or surfaces, hand-to-mouth contact is a hazard. 
How much do people need to worry about what fire leaves behind? 
When scientists did precise studies of the soils after the devastating 2021 Marshall fire in Colorado, they found higher levels of metals like lead, chromium, copper and zinc in the burned areas than non-burned areas – but overall the levels were below the threshold for danger for human health. 
But the risk is different for every property – so getting your soil tested is important. In Los Angeles County, CAP.LA has helped, and so has the LA Department of Public Health – which prioritizes properties located in the Eaton and Palisades burn areas for free soil testing – as well as the USC Clean Project. CAP.LA’s map shows aggregated self-sampling results for lead testing in soil. 
In general, the risk depends on how your soil and outdoor spaces are used. Young children who play in the dirt often are more at risk than adults. People who eat often from their gardens are also at a slightly higher risk – though overall, food from gardens is safe (with precautions), even after fires. 
Experts advise taking into consideration the frequency of your exposure to build a profile of your risk – with greater concern for is this a children’s play area or garden where you go multiple times a day compared to a burned building which will eventually be covered by a new foundation of a future house. 
What contamination could be harmful? 
Many parts of California have long had a problem with lead: lead-based paint and leaded gasoline left their mark on the landscape. Even before the fires, a study of 600 soil samples from urban areas across Los Angeles County found an average of 180 ppm of lead in soils. 
The California Department of Toxic Substances Control uses a level of 80 parts per million in residential soil as a screening level cutoff, above which concentrations may be unsafe for young children, fetuses, and pregnant people. That’s more protective than the federal Environmental Protection Agency’s threshold for safety, which was 400 parts per million before the Biden Administration lowered it to 200 parts per million in 2024. 
If soils have more than this amount, children should not play in them and people should make sure to completely clean any root vegetables growing there. Even if there is a lot of lead in the soil, it doesn’t mean there’s a lot of lead in your body – for the lead to wind up inside you, it means you’re ingesting dust or food or interacting a lot with the soil. 
What can I do to reduce the risks? 
Straightforward solutions can help the situation. For soil you can’t move, the easiest is just to cover the bare dirt with something else – mulch, woodchips, or even grass. Using raised beds or containers with clean soil for gardening creates a barrier between the contaminated soil and the clean soil for plants to grow in. Adding compost to soil can also increase populations of microbes and fungi, which help break down some chemicals in soil. Soaking vegetables in a 10% vinegar solution can take any remaining soil particles. 
Take off your shoes when entering your home, and make sure you’re washing hands and your pet’s paws after they are touching the bare dirt. Wet mopping and cleaning areas around the front door can also go a long way in keeping lead particles out.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/010824_Eaton-Fire_JH_CM_25.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-08 08:58:44.286455

During Lance Shockley’s final moments in Missouri’s execution chamber in October 2025, he wanted his daughter, an ordained minister, by his side as his spiritual adviser. 
A few years earlier, the U.S. Supreme Court had expanded religious rights for the condemned, saying spiritual advisers could accompany them into the execution chamber and could touch them while praying aloud. 
But the Missouri Department of Corrections refused Shockley his chosen spiritual adviser, and he died alone.

It was the second time Missouri officials had denied someone their spiritual adviser in their dying moments. Yet, the state permitted eight other religious leaders to sit and pray within the death chamber during executions, an inconsistency that advocates said lacked compassion in the wake of the Supreme Court decision.
The presence of spiritual advisers at executions has been a question in several states. In recent years, the U.S. Supreme Court has favored religious freedoms inside and beyond prison walls. In its 2022 ruling in Ramirez v. Collier, the court said a condemned man in Texas could have a spiritual adviser who was allowed to lay hands on him and pray out loud while he was put to death. 
The court’s 8-1 decision was rooted in the First Amendment and the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, which provides religious protections for incarcerated individuals. The justices urged states to adopt policies streamlining the process for allowing spiritual advisers into execution chambers. 
The Missouri Department of Corrections ignored the court’s advice and has not updated its execution protocols, which were last adopted in 2013. 
A lack of clear policies enables the corrections department to deny advisers arbitrarily, said Megan Crane, co-director of the MacArthur Justice Center, a nonprofit civil rights organization.
“We’re talking about constitutional rights in someone’s dying moments,” she said. 
The Missouri Department of Corrections has allowed some people to have spiritual advisers. In 2022, the Rev. Darryl Gray placed his hand on Kevin Johnson’s shoulder and prayed while he was being executed. Gray, a St. Louis minister, was the first spiritual adviser in the state permitted to sit with someone being put to death. 
Gray later said Johnson’s last words were, “They didn’t take my dignity.” As the drug flowed, he felt Johnson grow cold. He prayed before corrections officers led him out of the chamber.
Thirteen states have carried out executions since the Ramirez v. Collier decision, according to data compiled by the Death Penalty Information Center, a nonprofit organization that tracks capital punishment in the U.S. But the way each state has handled spiritual advisers has varied. Some allowed an adviser even before the court’s decision. Others have updated their policies to spell out what spiritual advisers are allowed to do. Some, like Missouri, are vague. Theirs only says the person facing death can have up to two clergy members as witnesses. 

Questions have also surfaced as states adopt execution methods like nitrogen gas and firing squads. And what’s permitted on paper isn’t always what unfolds in the chamber.
Missouri uses lethal injection to carry out executions. Leonard “Raheem” Taylor, who was Muslim, wanted an imam by his side at his 2023 execution. The prison denied his request because he had previously signed a form saying he didn’t want witnesses. Taylor’s lawyers argued he had been told the form was for family members, and he did not want any relatives to witness his death. When the lawyers brought the issue up to the prison, they were informed it was too late. Court documents show officials gave conflicting deadlines for requesting a spiritual adviser. 
According to a letter from the warden, the imam had been cleared to visit Taylor on the morning of his execution, but he couldn’t be in the chamber “due to institutional security concerns related to changing the protocol at this late hour.”
Taylor died alone.
“I don’t think it’s very compassionate,” Kevin Schriener, one of Taylor’s attorneys, recently said. “I think arrangements could have been made.”
Shockley’s two daughters had previously been ordained and one of them is a full-time missionary. He wanted one of them to perform communion and anoint him with oil before the execution. He wanted the other to be in the chamber with him. 
The Department of Corrections has a policy allowing prisoners to request a spiritual adviser who’s also a family member, but said it does not apply to those under a death warrant. The prison denied Shockley’s request, saying that family members pose a danger because they could try to dislodge the IV line that delivers the fatal drug. 
Lawyers for Shockley, who was sentenced to death in 2009, noted that his daughters had been visiting him in prison since they were young girls without any issues. 
Department of Corrections spokesperson Karen Pojmann said a state statute prohibits relatives from serving as spiritual advisers to those facing execution. 
However, Joseph Welling, an attorney and professor at Saint Louis University’s law school, said the courts have never interpreted the statute to say that. 
Heidi Moore, executive director of Missourians to Abolish the Death Penalty, said the state’s failure to update its policy is a dereliction of duty.
The Rev. Jeff Hood, who has been a spiritual adviser to men on death rows in five states, said other states have a more defined process. But even when states allow an adviser, some have specific rules on physical contact. For example, in Oklahoma, the adviser is allowed to touch the person’s foot, according to Department of Corrections spokeswoman Kay Thompson. 
In 2024, Alabama introduced nitrogen hypoxia as an execution method. Louisiana followed suit the next year. Both states enacted policies allowing spiritual advisers in the chamber, and they must sign a form acknowledging the risks should the gas leak. Their policies also specify when a person facing execution has to request an adviser. 
In the weeks leading up to Jessie Hoffman Jr.’s execution in March in Louisiana, the Rev. Reimoku Gregory Smith, a novice Zen priest, became his spiritual adviser. They formed a relationship based on truth, authenticity and courage, Smith said.
In the chamber, Smith knew he was not allowed to touch Hoffman. Instead, he sat a couple of feet away in a square that had been taped off. He was allowed to chant for five minutes — not enough time to finish the prayer — after the gas had been turned on. 
Smith said that spiritual advisers are important because they serve as compassionate witnesses. For him, that meant seeing Hoffman for the man he had become and, in his final moments, facing impermanence with him without fear. Smith officiated Hoffman’s funeral, where he highlighted Hoffman’s spiritual transformation.
In 2025, South Carolina began using firing squads. It also uses lethal injection. The person facing death can pick two witnesses — an attorney, a spiritual adviser or a family member. Most have selected their lawyer as the first witness, with the second choice split between a relative and a spiritual adviser, according to Jeffrey Collins, an Associated Press reporter who has attended the past seven executions since the state restarted executing people in 2024. Spiritual advisers have not been in the chamber regardless of the method, he said. 
Even when there is a policy, what happens in practice may not be what an adviser expects. 
The Rev. Bri-anne Swan wrestled with becoming a spiritual adviser to her longtime friend Ramiro Gonzalez in Texas. She worried that by agreeing to be his adviser, she would become complicit in his execution, an act that she considered abhorrent. Ultimately, she wanted to be there so that he would feel love in his final moment. 
At Gonzalez’s execution in 2024, Swan thought she had permission from the prison to hold his right hand, but when they were in the chamber, his hand was tethered to the gurney with a bandage, and she wasn’t able to grasp it. Not being able to hold his hand was one of the most heartbreaking parts of the process, Swan said. 
Robert Dunham, an attorney and director of the Death Penalty Policy Project, said spiritual advisers in the context of executions are a matter of constitutional rights — and human decency.
“It’s the decent thing to do, to comply with these religious requests,” Dunham said. “It’s something that states shouldn’t be opposing.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/aeWZ1q6A-1024x536.jpeg,,,2026-01-08 08:12:53.245174

(Getty Images)In the wake of the federal government changing its guidance on childhood vaccine recommendations, Utah health officials are telling Utahns to “determine which vaccines are right for you and your family” while awaiting final recommendations from a federal panel. 
Under President Donald Trump’s administration, new federal guidelines no longer universally recommend children receive six vaccines (to prevent rotavirus, hepatitis A and hepatitis B, meningitis, RSV, COVID-19 and influenza).  
Now, the Trump administration says those vaccines should be based on “shared clinical decision-making.” 
“It is not always possible for public health authorities to clearly define who will benefit from an immunization, who has the relevant risk factors, or who is at risk for exposure,” say the new guidelines issued earlier this week. “Physicians and parents, who know the child, are then best equipped to decide based on individual characteristics.” 
Utah’s measles outbreak, among the largest in the country, is likely to get worse

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, however, continues to recommend that all children are vaccinated against diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis (whooping cough), Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib), Pneumococcal conjugate, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, human papillomavirus (HPV), and varicella (chickenpox).
Asked Wednesday about how Utah health officials are responding to the new federal guidance, the Utah Department of Health and Human Services issued a prepared statement saying it’s “aware of the changes to the vaccine schedules” recommended by the CDC, but that state officials are waiting for a final recommendation from a federal panel before implementing any changes. 
“We will await the final recommendations by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, (which) will meet at the end of February,” the DHHS statement said. 
Meanwhile, Utah state health officials recommended that Utahns consult with their doctors when making decisions about vaccines. 
“As is the case with all vaccines, DHHS recommends you work closely with your healthcare provider to determine which vaccines are right for you and your family,” the statement said. “Vaccines are a safe, proven, and effective tool for proactively safeguarding public health and preventing the devastating effects of vaccine-preventable disease.”
Colorado childhood vaccine recommendations stay the same despite federal changes

Medical groups including the American Academy of Pediatrics have opposed the federal guideline changes, calling them “dangerous and unnecessary.” 
“For decades, leading health experts, immunologists, and pediatricians have carefully reviewed new data and evidence as part of the immunization recommendation process, helping to keep newborns, infants, and children protected from diseases they could be exposed to in the United States as they develop and grow,” Andrew Racine, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics said in a statement issued Monday in reaction to the guideline changes. “Today’s decision, which was based on a brief review of other countries’ practices, upends this deliberate scientific process.
Utah’s neighboring state of Colorado, meanwhile, is keeping its childhood vaccine recommendations the same despite the federal changes.
The Colorado Board of Health, in accordance with a 2025 state law, updated state vaccine guidance so that it could rely on science-based recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics and other authorities, in addition to the federal government. Colorado legislators passed that law out of fear that the Trump administration would make recommendations for vaccinations that are inconsistent with scientific evidence.

“Those are both open investigations, and there will be an investigation and we will try to make a link between the flu and the death,” Stubblefield said.

The department’s tracking website is updated weekly, he said. As of Saturday, 7.54% of emergency department visits presented symptoms of a respiratory illness, a decrease from 10.76% the week prior. Of those, most tested positive for the flu, followed by RSV, then COVID.
As of Wednesday, about 763,600 Alabamians were vaccinated against the flu for the 2025-26 season, more than double the vaccinations reported in November, according to data from ADPH. The doses administered is about 9,000 less than the total administered in the 2024-25 season, according to data from ADPH.
“I was pleased that the numbers were at least similar,” Stubblefield said.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) track flu cases more intensively than the state department, Stubblefield said. According to the CDC’s FluView, there had been at least 17 influenza deaths in Alabama as of Dec. 27. 
There are many strains of the flu that circulate at different times throughout the season, Stubblefield said. According to the CDC’s FluView, all of Alabama’s reported flu cases have been of the A strain, which has multiple subtypes as well. 
“If people want the flu vaccine, we try to tell them that the flu vaccine contains multiple strains of flu. We do know that multiple strains are circulating the United States,” Stubblefield said. “It is possible to get the flu twice in a season.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Flu-and-COVID-shot-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-08 08:12:53.245174

Nevada Health Authority Director Stacie Weeks told state lawmakers on Tuesday that 1 in 5 people who have actively shopped for and enrolled in a health insurance plan using the state’s marketplace have chosen a public option plan. These public option plans, called Battle Born State Plans, are available for the first time this year.
 
Open enrollment is currently underway and runs through Jan. 15, 2026.

Public option plans cover the same essential health benefits required by the Affordable Care Act, but they are designed to cost less. They are accessible only through Nevada Health Link, the state’s ACA exchange, and their brokers and navigators.
The plans appear to be softening the blow of the overall skyrocketing insurance premium rates being experienced in Nevada and across the nation. For 2026 coverage, health insurance premiums on existing plans were approved for an average rate increase of 26%.
The public option plans “and the competitive pressures they bring are helping to temper the effects of those rate increases,” Nevada Health Authority Chief of Staff Allison Genco Herzik told the Nevada Current, “and data indicates that all rates are about 4.6% lower than they would be without the public option.”
For many Nevadans the public option plans are the cheapest available to them, though that isn’t universally true across the state, added Genco Herzik. One provider serving Washoe, Douglas, Lyon, Storey counties priced “very aggressively” and has plans less expensive than the public option plans.
That said, insurance plans aren’t expected to be cheaper this year than last year.
Weeks acknowledged to lawmakers that families may be forced into making tough decisions, like leaving their preferred providers or moving to a higher deductible plan.
Some health care advocates fear the rate of people going without health insurance will rise this year.
Weeks told lawmakers that 100,432 people were enrolled in a plan through Nevada Health Link as of Dec. 27. At the same point of open enrollment last year, 102,958 people were enrolled.
“We’re not that far off, surprisingly, given all the rate increases,” Weeks said.
But there’s a big caveat to those numbers. About half of those people were automatically re-enrolled into plans, said Weeks, “which means they haven’t quite gotten their bill.”
She continued, “When they get their first premium bill this month, we are likely to see… There’s going to be, probably, some fluctuation there.”
As of late December, Battle Born State Plans made up 8 to 9% of total Nevada Health Link enrollment, according to Weeks. That percentage is expected to rise through the end of the state’s open enrollment period, especially if people abandon their current plans with skyrocketing rates.
“I think we’re not going to have a good sense of where this all lands until we get through this month,” she said. “We could have people drop off.”
Open enrollment ends Jan. 15.
After that date, Nevadans will only be able to enroll if they have a “qualifying life event,” like losing existing health insurance or having a baby.
Weeks said the Nevada Health Authority is encouraging Nevadans to visit the Nevada Health Link website and shop for plans, or speak to a navigator who can help them compare options.
“Please encourage your constituents to not give up if they get a high bill,” Weeks told lawmakers. “We do have affordable products. They may not offer the same benefits but … We really want people to come in and shop and make sure before they decide that they are just going to disenroll and be uninsured.”
Weeks’ comments come roughly two weeks after Nevada Health Link declined to release enrollment numbers for the first month of open enrollment. The agency in previous years has directly released those numbers.
After publication, Nevada Health Link directed the Current to a Dec. 5 fact sheet published by the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which reported that 18,786 Nevadans had signed up for a plan and just under 81,000 Nevadans had been auto-enrolled.
The introduction of a public option in Nevada has been years in the making. Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro (D-Las Vegas) in 2021 sponsored legislation to establish the option. It passed on partylines.
The following year it became a campaign issue, with then-gubernatorial candidate Joe Lombardo calling it “bullshit.” In his inaugural state-of-the-state address in early 2022, now-Gov. Lombardo said the public option needed to be “substantially revised, or better yet repealed.”
Later, in fall of 2023, Lombardo announced Nevada’s public option plan would continue to move forward but include a reinsurance program that brings down premium rates for both the public option and private option plans available through Nevada Health Link.
Senate Minority Leader Robin Titus (R-Wellington) and the National Taxpayers Union challenged the constitutionality of the 2021 bill in similar lawsuits in 2024 and 2025. Both lawsuits were dismissed by a district court.

,Mississippi Today,2026-01-08 13:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Opening statements in welfare scandal trial paint former director as villain who doled out millions over infatuation,Anna Wolfe,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/08/opening-statements-welfare-scandal-trial-villain/,"Ted ""Teddy"" DiBiase Jr. appears in a 2019 internal Mississippi Department of Human Services video message to agency workers.","The audio version of this story is AI generated and is not human reviewed. It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
In the trial of former professional wrestler Ted “Teddy” DiBiase Jr. about his alleged role in a brazen welfare heist, the prosecution and defense agree on the identity of the true antagonist in the scheme. 
During opening statements for the federal government Wednesday, Assistant U.S. Attorney John Meynardie called the state’s former welfare director John Davis the “big villain in this case,” without whom, none of the crimes would have occurred. DiBiase’s defense attorney Scott Gilbert concurred, calling Davis a dictator.
DAY 1: 83 witnesses could enter the ring in Mississippi welfare scandal trialTRIAL PREVIEW: Ex-WWE wrestler faces feds in first – and potentially only – criminal trial in Mississippi welfare scandal
In 2018, in less than six weeks and in rapid succession, Davis helped secure four separate contracts for the wrestler’s companies totaling $2.5 million. The agreements pertained to services that Mississippi was supposed to carry out under the federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program and The Emergency Food Assistance Program. None of this is in dispute.
The prosecution and defense also agree on the context in which this occurred. The Mississippi Department of Human Services is an agency under the control of the governor, and the governor at the time, Republican Phil Bryant, was clear that  he wanted Davis “to shrink the footprint of this agency,” Gilbert said.
“His marching orders from Phil Bryant were to privatize services at DHS,” Meynardie said. 
This resulted in Davis pushing out a large portion of the state’s TANF fund – as much as $40 million in one year – to two nonprofits to run a statewide anti-poverty initiative called Families First for Mississippi. The organizations were given wide latitude to dole out the money as they wished, so long as they also funded Davis’ desires, the government contends. Meynardie said one of the nonprofit directors, Christie Webb, will testify that she only inked the deals with DiBiase under duress, and that when she finally pushed back, she was punished.
Separate from managing unstable budgets, the nonprofits possessed nowhere near the manpower to wrangle social services across the state and deliver results, Gilbert said.

“It was an absolute unmitigated disaster, but John Davis, the dictator, didn’t care because he wanted to keep the governor happy,” Gilbert said.
Here’s where the stories diverge: The federal government argues Davis was not just a villain but also a mark — manipulated by the handsome charm deployed by DiBiase and his brother Brett DiBiase.
Davis had worked his way up through the lower ranks of the Mississippi Department of Human Services for over two decades before Bryant appointed him director in 2016, giving him control of a roughly $1 billion purse.
The prosecutor described Davis as a single, middle-aged man without any friends, “lonely by his admission,” and the DiBiases as two good-looking articulate young men who offered companionship.
“These two men showered affection on him, and he showered money back on them,” Meynardie said.
The prosecutor periodically read text messages between the defendant and Davis, including one in which the welfare director quipped, “I bought your love.”
Gilbert rejected this narrative, contending that his client never asked Davis for a job or a dime, nor did he lie, cheat or steal anything. “When you see the texts, you’ll see who’s the one involved in the chicanery,” Gilbert said.
Davis first met the younger brother, Brett DiBiase, in 2017 when the former wrestler was working as a copier salesman. Brett DiBiase then introduced Davis to his brother and his father, Ted DiBiase Sr., the famed retired heel of the WWE known as the “Million Dollar Man.” The welfare agency quickly hired Brett DiBiase as a director’s assistant — and his role was essentially to “follow Davis around,” Meynardie said. The agency also began contracting with the older DiBiase’s ministry called Heart of David.
Eventually, Brett DiBiase was out, and the welfare director began recruiting Teddy DiBiase to fill the role. Only, the federal government alleges, Davis couldn’t pay enough.
“He wanted the money, more money, more money, more money,” Meynardie said.
Gilbert said his client intended to carry out the services in his agreements with the nonprofits, and that any failure to deliver was a result of the dysfunctional set-up of Families First and unresponsiveness from Davis and others.
The Mississippi welfare scandal largely occurred in broad daylight and was the result of a government program with few  checks and balances.
“Hollywood tends to convey conspiracies as crooks in a room planning out something,” Meynardie said.
Think “Oceans 11.” But that’s not usually how it plays out in real life, he added. Sometimes, the conduct starts out lawfully. The criminal conspiracy may just “creep in,” Meynardie said, with actors eventually making agreements to do things they know are wrong. This is how he described this case.
After opening statements, the federal government called its first witness, David Barton, former director of internal audit for the welfare department. He spent roughly two hours discussing the agency’s internal controls, and how they were previously lacking, and is scheduled to return to the witness stand Thursday.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/06143853/tuesday-turnaround.png,,,2026-01-08 08:12:53.245174

Californians can now easily follow what their state representatives say and do each week, as the Legislature considers about 5,000 bills before adjourning in August.


CalMatters is launching a free tool that helps Californians follow, engage and hold their Sacramento lawmakers accountable in a powerful new way.
Our new tool is a personalized, weekly newsletter called My Legislator, which delivers key updates about your California state assemblymember and senator straight to your email inbox.  We track everything lawmakers say, vote on, and introduce, and more, so that Californians can keep up with their elected leaders, and so elected leaders are accountable to their voters.
Sign up for My Legislator. And if you need help confirming who your state representatives are, don’t worry, our sign-up process has your back. 
This session, legislators will consider about 5,000 bills before adjourning in August. Those bills regulate so much of Californians’ quality of life, as state legislators make decisions on K-12 and college education, courts and prisons, health care, the environment, transportation, housing and homelessness and the cost of living in the world’s fourth largest economy. The state has an annual budget of more than $300 billion, and it distributes another $200 billion each year from the federal government.
That’s why each week during the legislative session, My Legislator tells you:

How your legislators cast their votes (or if they missed a vote)
What they said
Historical context around who’s funding and influencing them
The bills they authored as they make their way through the legislative process
How they’re measuring up to their colleagues on bills passed, missed votes, bipartisanship and more 
Announcements from their offices
What the numbers mean and how the lawmaking process works

Last fall, we test drove our My Legislator for one month and beta launched it with just under 3,000 readers. The feedback we received was incredible:

“The My Legislators newsletter provides useful information that is not available without a deep dive and significant time investment.” -Bill, Petaluma
“I get emails from both my state and federal representatives. But they only report what they want me to know. The CalMatters My Legislators newsletter succinctly tells me about what bills they write, what they are saying in the media, and especially, how they are voting. This is so helpful.” -Tracey, Oceanside
“The information about my representatives in the My Legislators newsletter is very revealing. I knew none of it, despite being deeply involved with civic groups for some time. Thank you, CalMatters.” -Susan, Los Angeles
“I am delighted to get this knowledge about my legislators in the CalMatters Digital Democracy newsletter! I wouldn’t have been aware of any of this information if it weren’t for this service.” -Jeff, Vallejo

(Andrea Tinker/Alabama Reflector)Democratic congressional candidates held a press conference Wednesday saying they feel confident in their prospects in the fall, despite running in districts that have tended to favor Republicans.  
Speaking at the Alabama Democratic Party’s headquarters in Montgomery, the candidates — including Clyde Jones for the 1st Congressional District in south Alabama;  Lee McInnis for the 3rd Congressional District in east Alabama; Amanda Puszcek for the 4th Congressional District running across north-central Alabama; Andrew Sneed in the 5th Congressional District in north Alabama; Keith Pilkington in the 6th Congressional District in central Alabama and U.S. Senate candidates Dakari Larriett and Mark Wheeler — said they would run on improving health care and what they called failures by Republican leaders in Washington.
“What we’re seeing is our Republican representatives in Washington are voting against the interest of their constituents, and their constituents are beginning to figure that out,” McInnis said. “So we are seeing a groundswell of discussion at this point that we’re all certain is going to turn into votes in November that will put Democrats in office where they haven’t been in a good long while.”

Democrats currently hold two of the state’s seven U.S. House seats: The 2nd district, represented by U.S. Rep. Shomari Figures, D-Mobile, and the 7th district, represented by U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell, D-Birmingham. But outside those districts, Democratic congressional candidates have struggled. 
Doug Jones, who represented Alabama in the U.S. Senate from 2017 to 2021 and now running for governor, is the only Alabama Democrat to serve in the Senate since 1994. 
The challenges for the candidates will be substantial, as many will be running against incumbent Republicans likely to have cash advantages in the general election. But those who attended the Wednesday event expressed hope for their prospects this year, the first since 2018 in which a Democrat will run in each seat. 
McInnis, who would face U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Saks if nominated, said he’s running to help his district obtain better access to health care services including access to trauma centers, mental health services and pediatricians.
“I began to see and realize that the 3rd Congressional District was not being appropriately represented in the US House representatives. We’re a rural district, so we face all the problems other rural counties face,” McInnis said.
Rural areas across Alabama have seen nine hospitals close with the most recent one happening last May.
Pusczek, a nurse, would face U.S. Rep. Robert Aderholt, R-Haleyville if nominated. She said she’s running to improve health care as well.
“There’s not a district in the state that is not devastated or been touched between the cuts and the rural hospitals are getting closed. Medicaid, ACA, we’re all affected,” she said.
Sneed, who would face U.S. Rep. Dale Strong, R-Madison if nominated, said his work in business led him to run for the U.S. House. 
“I worry about my guys. I worry about our company,” he said. “Everything costs too much. Everything’s getting a little too hard. We pay for their sick leave, and we pay for their paternity leave, and I pay for all their insurance, because nobody should be afraid to get hurt or be sick. I’ve lived that. But it’s not enough, and things are too hard.”
Larriett, running for Senate, said current leadership in the chamber isn’t adequate for Alabama.
“We deserve better leaders, leaders who know what the issues are and actually want to fix them,” Larriett said. “We deserve leaders that respect our First Amendment right and our way of worshiping. We deserve leaders that know the three branches of government and actually live in our state.”
Wheeler, also running for Senate, said after talking to Republican voters, many of them said they would vote for a Democrat.
“I can’t tell you how many Republicans stop and they want a deep, meaningful conversation, and they are so remarkably surprised that a Democrat is willing to stop, sit down, do something to draw them in,” he said. “And once you start having that meaningful connection, I would say one in 10 walk away saying they still couldn’t vote Democrat. The other nine 90% of those Republicans that walk up to me walk away saying, I believe in you. I can vote for you.”
Larriett said he’s focusing on engaging voter turnout in the state by meeting voters in areas they may frequent including churches.
Alabama’s voter turnout rate during the 2024 Presidential Election was the lowest in 30 years sitting at 58.5% of registered voters submitting ballots. The state has some of the lowest voter participation in the nation, due to a lack of early voting options and lack of competitive races.
Tabitha Isner, vice chair of the Alabama Democratic Party, said the organization is working to ensure voters understand the importance of voting in every election.
“I think it has never been more clear that having a balance in government is important, and people are seeing that at the federal level more clearly than ever, that when one party controls everything, things can get out of hand fast, especially if there are no if we’re not putting the brakes on ourselves,” she said. “We have to be working together and balancing one another out if we’re going to have a government that actually serves the people who have a variety of different interests, but we are dedicated and passionate and motivated and prepared to get folks out to the polls in November.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_8273-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-08 08:12:53.245174

The candidate, who is in a three-way race for the Democratic nomination against U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham) and state Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak), said Thursday that he would adopt those metrics if elected to ensure that the state’s large utility companies have some accountability to the public if data centers proliferate in Michigan.
A wave of more than 15 new data center proposals have come into communities across the state, El-Sayed’s campaign said in a policy rollout, including a 1.4-gigawatt facility planned by Oracle and OpenAI, which is being developed by Related Digital.

El-Sayed said he was concerned about DTE Energy and Consumers Energy requesting more rate hikes without improved grid reliability coming to the fore if key regulations weren’t in place, or if the community didn’t have equal ground to advocate for themselves.
“We’ve watched as data center projects have proliferated up and down our state, raising alarm and concern about the impacts on water resources, electric bills, and safety,” El-Sayed said in a statement. “That’s because our local utilities have bought off the politicians who are supposed to regulate them–and because there simply hasn’t been the leadership to take on powerful corporations. These terms of engagement represent the bare minimum that data center projects should be able to guarantee if they want to move into our communities.”
El-Sayed said the protections should include a guarantee for zero rate hikes, with data centers paying for their own energy demands and not passed down to ratepayers, with community transparency at the heart of any negotiations. The candidate said communities must have a meaningful say in the decision.
Reliability guarantees must be included in the conversation, as well as job guarantees and infrastructure that secures the environment. That includes facilities with closed-loop water systems to avoid polluting the environment or stressing local water resources.
Binding agreements for real community benefits must be reached with utility companies and the developers of new data centers, like tangible upgrades to the electrical grid, water treatment facilities, and piping.
There must also be no clean-energy loopholes to sidestep clean energy laws, and all of the agreements must be enforceable through what El-Sayed called actionable penalties.

(Photo by Hal Brown for New Jersey Monitor)New Jersey should create an inspector general under the attorney general’s oversight, pass additional safeguards against conflicts of interest, and make it easier for residents to refer complaints to New Jersey’s top law enforcement official, a state commission said in a new report released Wednesday.
The Transparency and Reliability Uniting to Secure Trust Commission’s report and its recommendations are meant to boost public confidence in government while tackling corruption in the Garden State.
“The recommendations contained in this report are not a panacea, but they offer pathways for progress as the Department of Law and Public Safety continues its efforts to root out corruption and ensure that our government responds to the needs of New Jersey’s residents,” Attorney General Matt Platkin said in a letter attached to the report.
Advocates urge NJ lawmakers to protect transgender health care

Platkin is in his final days as New Jersey’s attorney general. Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill takes office on Jan. 20, and she has tapped former prosecutor Jen Davenport as Platkin’s successor.
The report calls for an inspector general within the law and public safety division — which Platkin’s office oversees — who would probe non-criminal fraud and abuses by government employees in an attempt at deterrence.
Unlike a recently stalled legislative proposal to shift some powers of the state comptroller to the State Commission of Investigation, which is partly overseen by legislative officials, the inspector general called for by the commission would leave other watchdogs intact.
The inspector general’s mission would have limited overlap with existing oversight offices, the report says. While the comptroller focuses on misuse of public funds, the inspector general would primarily target civil fraud and ethics or legal violations by state officials or contractors.
The Legislature should create the office of inspector general and grant it subpoena power, but the inspector general should use their discretion when deciding whether to release their findings to the public, the report says.
“The work of the proposed Office of the Inspector General would expand the ability of the Department to ensure that the government is worthy of the public it serves, holding it to the highest standards and rooting out wrongdoing even when it does not rise to the level of criminality,” it says.
A spokesperson for Senate President Nicholas Scutari (D-Union), who sponsored the legislation to shift some oversight powers away from the comptroller, did not return a request for comment. Scutari had said that measure was intended in part to create a state inspector general position to field complaints about law enforcement.
New Jersey once had an inspector general’s office, but it was consolidated into the comptroller’s office nearly 20 years ago.

CJ Griffin, an attorney and transparency advocate, said New Jersey could always use more oversight but stopped short of endorsing the report’s proposal.
“In general, I think there should always be more watchdogs than we have,” she said. “Whether that means we need new, entirely different watchdogs or just expanding the staffing at our current watchdogs, I don’t know.”
Griffin has represented the New Jersey Monitor in multiple legal matters.
The report also calls for a compliance unit within the Attorney General’s Office that would ensure individuals or establishments licensed by the state — like police officers, health care workers, and liquor stores, among others — comply with state laws and regulations. The unit should report its findings to the public through an online portal that includes information about the requirements imposed on entities regulated by the state.
“Making the results of the Compliance Unit’s work readily accessible to the public will significantly improve transparency, showing the public that the government is holding itself to account on an ongoing basis, and improving the public’s trust in the government as a whole,” the report says.
The state should also boost funding for the public integrity and accountability office, an anti-corruption office that has been assailed by critics after some very public stumbles, and consider rolling that office back into the criminal justice division, the report says. Those offices were one until then-Attorney General Gurbir Grewal in 2018 split public corruption investigations into their own unit.
“OPIA frequently charges complex cases involving large amounts of data and documents, where defendants are often represented by well‐resourced defense counsel at high‐powered law firms. It is in the public’s interest for the only statewide criminal public corruption prosecutors to be well‐resourced and supported so that they can handle cases efficiently,” the report says.

The endorsed bills include SB 32, sponsored by Sen. Wes Kitchens, R-Arab, which would exempt households from paying solid waste collection fees if the sole income in the house comes from veterans’ benefits.
Alabama currently exempts households from paying such utility fees if the sole source of income comes from Social Security benefits.
The committee also endorsed HB 58 and HB 60, sponsored by Rep. Ontario Tillman, D-Bessemer, that would require courts in criminal and civil cases to grant continuance if someone who is connected to the case cannot attend the proceedings for reasons pertaining to military service.
State statute already allows the court to grant a continuance at the request of one of the parties in the case, but the two measures that Tillman introduced would require it.
It gives the same consideration to witnesses in the case provided that the witness is critical to the proceedings and if the individual is outside the state at the time of the proceedings.
The bill would also require that bail be set for defendants in such cases.
The committee also voted to support a package of still-to-be-filed bills backed by the Alabama Military Stability Foundation, a private, nonprofit organization that supports the state’s military installations, missions and families that was established in 2011.
Two of the proposals would expand scholarships to the children and spouses of military veterans. One lowers the disability rating for veterans from 40% to 30% to allow dependents to be eligible for the GI Dependent Scholarship Program. The program offers spouses and children of veterans with funding for college.
A disability rating is a measure of the severity of health issues that veterans experience while serving in the military. Reducing the disability expands the pool of veterans who are eligible.
The second measure expands the program to include medical degrees.
“There is a short list right now, this would expand the list,” Schmidbauer said. “This one, I think, is very important because, within the state of Alabama, we are short medical providers, we are short nurses, we are short doctors, so the more of our dependents and our children that we can get these degrees, it would not only benefit our military, it would also benefit our state because we would have more medical providers.”
Members of the committee also endorsed a proposal to provide a tax break on the first $5,000 of pay that members of the National Guard receive when they deploy for training. Another measure would extend a tax break for civilians who work for the military for their pay when they are deployed or mobilized.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Alabama-State-Capitol-Nov-14-2025-1024x682.jpg,,,2026-01-08 07:11:43.308142

(Photo courtesy of GE Vernova)While a natural gas power plant proposed for the site of a former coal plant in South Carolina’s Lowcountry has dominated recent headlines, there’s another gas-fired project in the works in the Palmetto State.
Duke Energy is in the process of seeking regulatory approval for a new, $3.2 billion plant in the Upstate.
“We’re at a critical juncture in preparing for South Carolina’s reliable energy future,” Duke’s regulatory chief, Heather Shirley Smith, wrote in an application making the company’s case to state utility regulators.
“Swiftly expanding our generation capacity is essential to keep pace with the state’s booming development and economic success,” Smith added.
The company is scheduled to go before the state Public Service Commission on Jan. 28 as it makes its pitch for the 1,400-megawatt plant that will employ 35 full-time workers just south of Anderson.
A final decision is expected near the end of April.
If the project receives all necessary approvals — which includes multiple permits from Anderson County, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the state environmental agency, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the State Historic Preservation Office, in addition to the Public Service Commission — construction could begin in mid-2027 with operations targeted for as early as January 2031.
A different plant
There are several differences between Duke’s proposal and the joint project on the banks of the Edisto River near Canadys that’s under pursuit by Dominion Energy and state-owned utility Santee Cooper.
For starters, it’s about 800 megawatts smaller than the joint build and is projected to cost nearly $2 billion less.
Dominion and Santee Cooper faced criticism after announcing the price tag for the Canady’s project had doubled — to $5 billion — from early estimates.
One of the major drivers behind the jump is increased demand for the gas-fired turbines that produce the power. As utilities worldwide race to build these plants, costs for parts have skyrocketed.
How a Greenville turbine factory earned a White House shoutout

“We are not the only utility building generation — states all around us are also experiencing growth and are meeting it by adding new natural gas generation capacity to the mix,” Smith wrote.
In the U.S., between 2024 and 2028, companies are expected to build 65 new natural gas generators, Duke executives wrote in their testimony. Surrounding states, including Georgia, Virginia, Florida, North Carolina and Tennessee, all have projects pending.
But Duke has already locked in a deal with GE Vernova in April to buy 11 turbines from the company’s Greenville factory. That’s on top of eight other turbines the utility said it had recently acquired.
The Duke project also won’t require construction of a new interstate pipeline to carry the gas needed to power the plant. The Transcontinental Gas Pipeline already runs through the Upstate less than a mile from the 193-acre power plant site.
Santee Cooper and Dominion’s proposed plant is contingent on approval of a $431 million dollar pipeline under development by Kinder Morgan to bring gas up from Georgia. Some environmental groups have raised concern about that pipeline’s proximity to the ACE Basin, a 350,000-acre undeveloped estuary named for the Ashepoo, Combahee, and Edisto rivers that feed it.
About the Duke site
Pipeline could impact 185 SC landowners on route to proposed new gas power plant

Duke’s plant will only take up about a quarter of the total land at the site. The nearly 4 acres of wetlands and 7,400 feet of streams there won’t be disturbed.
There are also existing power lines, though they’ll likely have to be upgraded to handle a heftier electric load.
Duke had considered building at its existing W.S. Lee power plant site, also in Anderson County, rather than using previously undeveloped pastureland. However, that would have required 5 miles of large new transmission lines.
And the plant will be largely air-cooled. Rather than the 9.5 million gallons of water per day needed to cool the power-making equipment in a traditional gas-fired plant, this one will use a little more than half a million per day.
While Duke will be the main owner of the plant, five of South Carolina’s Upstate electric cooperatives plan to take a 7% ownership in the facility, buying about 100 megawatts of the power it produces. Cooperatives in North Carolina are striking a similar deal.
In exchange for the investment, Duke plans to ask Anderson County officials for a break on its property tax bill. How much the incentive package will reduce taxes is unknown. But the company, in its regulatory filing, wrote it expects to pay $16.7 million on average in annual property taxes for the first 10 years of operation.
Duke, according to its website, will hold an open house from 4 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. on Jan. 26 at the Anderson Civic Center for residents seeking more information about the project.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ge_vernova_greenville-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-08 07:11:43.308142

Greg Goode, the E-Verify bill's author, speaks in committee on Thursday, April 3, 2025. (Photo by Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)A bill to close “loopholes” in Indiana’s employment eligibility verification law could bar employers who purposefully flout the requirements from taking part in public works projects for a year.
“The law of the state of Indiana currently allows for individuals who are in the United States of America illegally to work on taxpayer-funded projects,” Sen. Greg Goode told the Senate’s Pensions and Labor Committee on Wednesday. “Let that sink in for a moment.”
He said Indiana Code hasn’t “caught up with” construction delivery methods, “creating some loopholes” that he claimed divert jobs away from citizens or those on the path to citizenship.
Goode, R-Terre Haute, wants to tighten state requirements through his Senate Bill 87.
Public work project contracts entered into or renewed after June 30 would have to include a provision requiring the primary contractor and all tiers of subcontractors to enroll in E-Verify, an internet-based federal program that cross-checks a new hire’s eligibility to work in the U.S.
The system compares information from the mandatory employment eligibility Form I-9 to records maintained by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Social Security Administration.
Contractors and all tiers of subcontractors would have to submit an employee’s E-Verify case number to the agency overseeing a public works project before that person could begin work.

Under the legislation, employers that “knowingly or intentionally” fail to comply would be banned from public works contracts for a year.
“I had an instance in my own district — that’s how this whole issue came to my attention — where there was a public works project that hired individuals … here illegally,” Goode told the committee. “And I stopped to think, you know,  these are jobs that could have gone to people from Terre Haute or Brazil or Sullivan … I think that’s fundamentally wrong.”
Rob Henderson, the executive director of the Indiana State Building and Construction Trades Council, said the largest loophole “basically allows a construction manager on the project to self-perform” employment verification.
He said that provision applied only to state educational institutions at first, but was expanded and now is an option for “any” public works project.
Matt Bell, a lobbyist with the Associated Builders and Contractors of Indiana/Kentucky, acknowledged that’s a “glaring loophole” but said the legislation goes worrisomely further.
The group was most concerned the bill would make general contractors liable for what subcontractors — or the subcontractors of their subcontractors — do or don’t do.
“That’s a significant change in law, one that we’re very concerned about as we go forward,” Bell said.
He also characterized E-Verify as error-prone and argued the legislation wouldn’t protect employers from false negatives or positives despite the severe punishment prescribed.
“Employers acting in good faith should not be penalized,” Bell said. “I see no safe harbor in here.”

Indiana Department of Administration Commissioner Brandon Clifton threw his support behind the bill, noting it builds on an executive order from Gov. Mike Braun directing IDOA to update the state’s boilerplate contracting language with an E-Verify precondition.
“The one addition to the executive order presented in Senate Bill 87 is the verification,” Clifton said. “We are not currently verifying the use of E-Verify in our contracts. The contract itself is a self-attestation.”
But, he added, the fiscal impact remains unclear. An analysis by the nonpartisan Legislative Services Agency predicted the changes could be absorbed without additional spending.
“Are we going to verify every staff member, every employee of the contractor or subcontractor? Are we going to audit a few of those?” Clifton said. The first approach would cost more.
The legislation was up for testimony only on Wednesday, not a vote, with changes possible next week.
“I think there were some very important questions relating to the enforcement piece, and I really want to make sure that we’re projecting fairness,” Goode told the Capital Chronicle. “Yes, we are articulating our standards of accountability, but I think that there’s a way to do this, to work with our contractors and subcontractors, to make certain that we don’t have to be overly heavy-handed.”
Goode said he’s still hoping to get it across the finish line despite a shorter-than-usual legislative session. The idea is already further along than last year, he noted, when it didn’t get a hearing.
Lawmakers have less than eight weeks to wrap up business. The General Assembly can meet until mid-March during a non-budget year, but leaders plan to adjourn two weeks sooner to offset the cost of the two weeks they spent on an unsuccessful congressional redistricting push in December.

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)The fatal shooting of a Minneapolis woman by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer on Wednesday—after the agent fired through the window of her car—has renewed national scrutiny of ICE’s expanding role and the growing involvement of local law enforcement in federal immigration operations.
As federal immigration enforcement expands nationwide, a growing number of local law enforcement agencies, including in Michigan, are entering formal agreements with ICE, potentially reshaping the relationship between federal and local policing.
The Minneapolis shooting, reported as ICE officers were attempting to stop a vehicle, has intensified concerns among civil rights advocates about accountability, use of force, and the spillover effects of immigration enforcement into routine policing.

Since October 2025, when the Department of Homeland Security began offering financial incentives such as salary reimbursements and performance-based awards, participation in ICE’s 287(g) program has accelerated. 
In Michigan, where seven agencies have signed agreements under different enforcement models, police chiefs and sheriffs say the partnerships largely formalize long-standing cooperation with federal authorities—setting the stage for renewed scrutiny of a program with a long and contested history.
Separate federal offices used to administer immigration and naturalization in the United States. They were consolidated into the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, or INS, in 1933, initially under the Department of Labor, later transferred under the Department of Justice in 1940.
The INS rebranded as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and moved under the auspices of the newly established Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in 2003.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Section 287(g) was added to the United States Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1996, and outlined how state and local law enforcement agencies could establish agreements with INS/ICE. These agreements allow local law enforcement officers to “perform a function of an immigration officer in relation to the investigation, apprehension, or detention of aliens in the United States (including the transportation of such aliens across State lines to detention centers).”
Recent data released by ICE shows active agreements dating back to 2019, when law enforcement agencies in Florida began signing up, followed by Texas and other states later that year. To date, Florida and Texas law enforcement agencies comprise more than 60% of those with agreements in place.
As of December 30, 2025, ICE reported maintaining 1,274 agreements with 975 agencies in 46 states—some agencies maintain several agreements, as they take several forms, or models.

Models, training and certification
Existing agreements fall under three models: jail enforcement, warrant service officer and task force. A fourth model, tribal task force, was added in December 2025. All but 134 of the active agreements were signed after the Trump administration brought back the task force model, which had been discontinued in 2012 after the Department of Justice (in North Carolina and Arizona) and independent researchers found cases of racial profiling and patterns of constitutional violations.
More than half of agreements in place today are under the task force model.

The Jackson County Sheriff’s Office has the oldest active 287(g) agreement in Michigan, having signed in March 2025 under the warrant service officer model. The sheriff’s offices in Berrien and Calhoun counties later joined under the same model.
“The jail enforcement model requires deputies to attend training out of state and with current staffing levels we did not see this as a good option for us at this time,” said Berrien County Sheriff Chuck Heit. “The task force model also requires extensive training out of state and would then give us the authority to enforce immigration law ourselves, which is not an option I am interested in at this time.”
The warrant service model requires the least training.
“This program only pertains to individuals who are in our custody at the Berrien County Jail,” said Heit.
He said the program would streamline processes already in place to execute ICE administrative warrants.
“We have cooperated with ICE for over 20 years in holding inmates for up to 48 hours,” he said. “The safest way to deal with an immigration warrant is when the individual is already in custody.”
In late December, both Heit and Jackson County Sheriff Gary R. Schuette said they were still waiting for ICE to complete training for jail staff.
“It’s kind of on them,” said Schuette. “Ball’s in their court.”
“We are looking at getting six of our staff trained in the warrant service officer program,” said Heit. “We are looking for this training to occur in early 2026.”
Local immigration enforcement in theory and practice
Located south of Detroit, the City of Taylor Police Department signed the oldest active 287(g) memorandum of agreement in Michigan under the task force model, entering the MOA in late April 2025. Sheriffs in Roscommon and Crawford counties followed, while in nearby Ogemaw County, in November 2025, the City of West Branch became the most recent agency in Michigan to sign a 287(g) task force MOA.
The task force model requires the most training and the agreement language authorizes a number of immigration enforcement actions for a certified local law enforcement officer. These include arresting and interrogating suspected aliens without a warrant, serving and executing warrants of arrest for immigration violations, taking and maintaining custody of and transporting aliens arrested by ICE.
Police chiefs in West Branch and Taylor said the program has not impacted their operations.
“287(g) doesn’t change a thing,” said Taylor Police Chief John Blair. “If we come into contact with someone who’s in the country illegally, we’ll contact ICE.”
Blair’s career in law enforcement involved coordinating with Customs and Border Patrol before ICE was established. He said cooperation with federal agencies, which themselves support local law enforcement, is natural.
He also acknowledged that training and certification present a challenge.
“The training is free but they’re not paying your guys to go to the training,” he said. “Time away from the responsibilities was a problem.”
“It doesn’t change anything that we do now,” said West Branch Police Chief Ken Walters, responding to a local resident at a city council meeting. “If we come into contact with an illegal alien right now on a criminal complaint—traffic crimes, any of that—that individual has always been taken into custody. Then they’re lodged in the county jail and then border patrol or DHS [ICE] would come and get them from the jail. The only difference is in the cooperative agreement, we’d do the transport to their facility.”

Perspectives on the 287(g) program
The Genesee County Sheriff’s Office and City of Center Line Police Department had signed MOAs earlier in fall 2025 but quickly rescinded them, the former citing changes in staffing duties. In Center Line, the mayor and city council withdrew from the agreement after public pressure.
“After listening to the public comments and discussing the 287(g) MOU with City Council members and the Mayor of Center Line, the City Manager has determined that it is in the City’s best interest to withdraw its MOA with ICE,” said the city in a public statement.
Berrien County Sheriff Chuck Heit, like Taylor Police Chief John Blair, reported a healthy working relationship with federal agencies.
“We have cooperated with ICE for over 20 years in holding inmates for them who have a valid hold just like we do for other agencies and jurisdictions,” he said. “We have a great working relationship with our federal law enforcement partners and will continue to assist each of them.”
Berrien County Undersheriff Greg Sanders suggested local immigration enforcement within the confines of the jail is preferable, “as opposed to having agents come to town and try to locate individuals out in the community.”
But in Texas, where state legislators mandated that all sheriffs participate in the 287(g) program, federal agent presence has not decreased.
“We’ve seen the contrary,” said Osvaldo Grimaldi, a policy and advocacy strategist with the ACLU of Texas. “As we’ve seen an increase in 287(g) agreements with our county sheriffs, we’ve also seen an increase in federal immigration agents in areas where 287(g) agreements have been signed or are going to be signed.”
Grimaldi said many agencies are compelled to join under the task force model.
“When it comes to police departments and other agencies that don’t run their own jail, that’s the only model that’s available to them,” he said.
Guidance to law enforcement agencies from the Michigan ACLU, updated in September 2025, observes that “[w]hen noncitizens perceive that local law enforcement agencies are helping to enforce federal immigration law, rather than prioritizing public safety in their communities, they may be less likely to reach out to police or sheriff’s departments when they are witnesses to or victims of a crime, because they fear that they or their loved ones might end up detained and deported.”
The guidance document notes that the term noncitizen “includes individuals who are not (yet) U.S. citizens—such as those with temporary status, legal presence, or permanent residency.”
The latest information on the 287(g) program is available at www.ice.gov/identify-and-arrest/287g.

Recent failed attempts by Gov. Mike Braun and Indiana House Speaker Todd Huston to redistrict legislative boundaries via hyper-partisan gerrymandering are a testament to the exclusionist philosophy that only one party has the solutions to the complex demands and issues facing our diverse state.
Let me explain.
I was born in the industrial heartland of working Hoosiers whose father and mother were subject to horrific acts of discriminatory exclusion throughout their lives. Parents who, because of their lifelong experiences and education, would never entertain a thought of voting for “racist Democrats” that dominated the national segregationist political atmosphere of their Depression-born lives.
Being their youngest, who grew up in Fort Wayne, I was always reared to observe and analyze political developments from a lens of true empowerment which placed emphasis on truth which no one party could honestly claim exclusivity.
I graduated from quality private and public schooling which later enabled me to go to Indiana University in Bloomington with dual degrees in Political Science and Telecommunications.
In 1986, Gov. Robert D. Orr selected me among 150+ applicants to participate in a graduate fellowship program to serve Hoosiers
I was blessed to serve in this capacity at various state agencies including the Indiana State Police. I had the honor of ,eeting Jim Sears — the first Black male Indiana State Police Trooper to pass his class in 1964.
I mention these facts not to brag but to bring perspective to my own political viewpoints, which are politically Independent.
Civil rights win
Immediately after leaving the Office of the Indiana Governor, I was hired as a management level employee of the Indiana Civil Rights Commission, where I was tasked with shepherding the legislative agenda of this agency.
In 1988, the federal government passed the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 which mandated that ALL states and localities receiving federal funds for Civil Rights Enforcement Activities amend their state statutes to add legal protections for persons with disabilities and familial status from discrimination in housing.
Indiana, a state notorious for its lack of civil rights protections, stood to lose much but was saved by the bipartisan leadership and sponsorship efforts of two key Indiana Republicans — Sens. William “Bill” Soards and Richard Bray, of Indianapolis and Martinsville, respectively.
At that time, Republican officials acknowledged that they represented all Indiana citizens regardless of who chose, endorsed, supported and ultimately elected them to office.
Lacking
My, how times have changed.
Today’s political leaders claim to represent the interests of all Hoosiers but only if they vote Republican.
As WTHR recently reported, Republican Sen. Mike Young wants to give the Indiana State Police responsibility for policing downtown Indianapolis as well as providing for a special prosecutor appointed by the governor. This would usurp and undermine the powers and electoral accountability of both the current elected Democratic Mayor and County Prosecutor effective December31, 2026.
In 2024, Trump received 58.6% of the vote in Indiana compared to 39.6% for Harris. Leaders shouldn’t ignore the 1.1 million Hoosiers that voted for different policies and priorities.
How is enshrining political and racial division into Indiana law considered to be either fair or reasonable? When our so-called leaders justify horrendous public policy actions that exclude entire groups of voters from having their ballots counted we have reached a new low in Indiana.
Disregarding the political will of Indiana voters is neither democratic or wise, and illustrates why our state’s elected political leadership is held in such profound disregard.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Indiana-Capitol-2-GettyImages-1089342774-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-08 07:11:43.308142

As physicians and Missourians, we remain grounded in our work based on what we see in exam rooms every day: people making deeply personal decisions, supported by evidence-based care. Even with a constitutional right in effect for more than a year, restoring care while navigating the lingering impacts of political interference remains ongoing and challenges our ability to provide care our patients are entitled to.
On the eve of a two-week trial in Jackson County — the most significant legal moment yet to realize that right — we are reminded that the health, dignity and well-being of people receiving care must remain at the center of this work.
That constitutional amendment, the Right to Reproductive Freedom Initiative, was approved by Missourians just over a year ago. That vote affirmed a simple principle that guides good medicine: health care decisions belong to patients, made in consultation with their trusted providers.
Within just months of that vote, Planned Parenthood resumed abortion care in Missouri. From Columbia to Kansas City to St. Louis, we’ve welcomed and treated patients who are relieved to receive procedural abortion care closer to home.
The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services has confirmed that abortion care is being provided in hospitals. After years of laws and restrictions hollowing out Missouri’s reproductive health care system by limiting how, when and whether providers could care for patients, we can once again find hope as we rebuild safe, local abortion access in Missouri.
Abortion care takes many forms, and all options must be available to ensure providers can offer the full range of options based on a patient’s medical needs and circumstances.
Procedural abortion, which is currently available in Missouri, is a medically necessary and appropriate option for many patients. So is medication abortion. This form of care uses the same safe and effective medications prescribed for miscarriage care and accounts for the majority of abortions nationwide, which is why we are challenging the ban on its use.
Building meaningful abortion access for patients across the state will not be possible without this essential care.
When government policies restrict or stigmatize specific forms of care, they interfere with the doctor–patient relationship. Interference creates delays, confusion, and fear, all of which can worsen health outcomes. Additionally, when patients fear scrutiny or exposure around their health care decisions, they may avoid care altogether.
That risk extends beyond abortion to miscarriage management, prenatal care, and routine reproductive health services.
These concerns are especially acute in Missouri, where more than 55 counties already lack OB/GYN providers. Patients in rural and low-income communities often travel long distances for care, taking time off work, arranging childcare, and absorbing additional costs. Political interference in reproductive health care compounds these barriers and deepens existing inequities for already vulnerable patients and their families.
Reproductive freedom is not theoretical. It is lived every day in exam rooms, where patients make decisions about their own bodies, and clinicians provide care guided by professional standards of care, ethics, and trust.
These patients are our neighbors, our friends, our family—Missourians whose lives, health, and dignity are shaped by whether they can access care when they need it.
The legal process that has unfolded since Missourians demanded their right to reproductive freedom has been technical and deliberative, and the upcoming trial will be no different. As physicians who provide this care, our obligation, both in the clinic and the courtroom, is clear: we center our patients, always.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMG_5136-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-08 07:11:43.308142

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen, the GOP’s frontrunner for governor, has accomplished something truly remarkable: He managed to commit multiple ethical violations, be publicly admonished by the Montana Supreme Court in a unanimous decision, and then announce—without irony—that he won.
That’s talent.
The Montana Commission on Practice unanimously concluded Knudsen engaged in “unprecedented misconduct” and recommended suspending his law license for 90 days based on 41 alleged violations. The Supreme Court did not agree with the Commission on every alleged violation, but it did unanimously conclude Knudsen violated the ethical rules governing attorneys. It then issued a 149-page public admonition—an extraordinarily rare judicial equivalent of a megaphone—and dismissed the case, bringing the matter to a close.
Knudsen’s core defense throughout the case was that the ethical rules simply didn’t apply to him. This is roughly equivalent to insisting gravity is optional if you really believe in yourself.
The court disagreed. Firmly. Unanimously. 
In clear, unmistakable language, it concluded Knudsen violated multiple rules governing all attorneys. Among other findings, the court held Knudsen violated Rule 3.4(c) by disobeying a direct court order for months and violated Rule 5.1(c) by allowing his subordinates to do the same. The Attorney General of Montana ignored the Montana Supreme Court and let his staff help.
The court also noted Knudsen used “extraordinarily inflammatory language” toward the Court and individual justices, accused the court of personal conflicts, and repeatedly claimed he did not have to follow court orders he believed were issued “improperly.” That argument generally works about as well as telling a police officer you don’t recognize the concept of speed limits.
After all that, Knudsen declared victory.
It’s like celebrating the sinking of the Titanic because the band sounded great.
Yes, the court declined to impose the professional “death penalty” of suspending Knudsen’s law license—a punishment that would have removed him from office under Montana’s Constitution. That decision was proportional and appropriate under the circumstances. Public censure is not leniency; it is a serious sanction reserved for serious misconduct. It reflects both accountability and restraint—recognizing that discipline should correct behavior, not merely end careers. Calling this outcome a “win” misses the point entirely.
Which brings us to Knudsen’s response. Instead of acknowledging the ruling, expressing regret, or committing to change, his office dismissed the case as a “frivolous complaint” and a “political stunt.” Translation:  I did nothing wrong.
That response matters. Knudsen is not just another lawyer. He is Montana’s top prosecutor, supervises more attorneys than anyone else in the state, and sets the tone for ethical conduct in Montana’s legal system. His example tells every lawyer under him—and every Montanan watching—that accountability is optional if you complain loudly enough.
Only time will tell whether the Supreme Court’s public admonition was adequate to address Knudsen’s ethical failings and to deter similar conduct in the future. Based on his response to the court’s ruling, it may not have been. The court exercised restraint and extended grace—carefully, deliberately and in full view of the public. Knudsen responded not with reflection or humility, but with defiance and attack. Grace was met with grievance. Accountability was met with contempt. That is not just stupid; it is stupid with gusto.
There’s a cynical part of me that suspects Knudsen will wear this public admonition as a campaign badge of honor, proof that he “fought the system.” I hope I’m wrong. Montana deserves leaders who understand that ethics are not partisan, court orders are not suggestions, and losing a case does not magically become winning by press release.
The lesson here is simple: Ethics still matter in Montana—even when inconvenient, even when ignored, even when mocked. The Supreme Court said so. Loudly.

Hoy said that the Falcon Report focused on behavioral health, correctional practices, health care, employee wellness, leadership development, agency culture, recruitment of staff and problems in the restrictive housing unit, otherwise known as solitary confinement. The review lasted nearly a year, and highlighted a number of positive changes within DOC that Hoy listed, including: 

Developing an objective custody classification system in 2023;
Restructuring the Bureau of Health Services in 2024,
Expanding the earned release program,
Transitioning the Waupun Correctional Institution to having all single cells,
Reforming restrictive housing in 2024 by enhancing training and increasing security rounds, 
Implementing new systems to track the number and frequency of security rounds, 
Retraining medication distribution and documentation, 
Performing security audits,
Requiring supervisory meetings at Waupun at the beginning of each shift,
Implementing a new restrictive housing policy. 

It wasn’t an entirely rosy picture, however. “As noted in the report, our agency is at a period of transition,” said Hoy. “We are not alone in navigating this unique point in time following the operational disruptions of the pandemic and the related staffing shortages that followed.” 
Hoy urged people to view the report in that context as he went into the areas of improvement it suggested. High vacancy rates for staff at different institutions remains an issue, although the DOC has been able to fill more security positions due to pay raises approved by the state Legislature. This has created a “new and unique concern,” Hoy said, in that many staff are new and do not have much correctional experience. Additionally, many staff members were hired during the COVID-19 pandemic, and thus have skewed perceptions of what normal DOC procedures look like. The highly restrictive, atypical protocols intended to stifle the spread of COVID-19 became the formative experience of this new generation of DOC guards and staff. 
The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
Mental health needs among DOC residents was another area of concern. Hoy noted that “44% of male persons in our care and 91% of female persons in our care have a mental health condition.” As a result of the study, DOC is working towards updating its mental health classification system, creating specific mental health units, better monitoring and collecting mental health data, and improving conditions within the restrictive housing unit, otherwise known as solitary confinement, and increasing programming and recreation. 
“So while the results of this study are both informative and valuable, they represent only the starting point,” said Hoy. “The true measure of our agency’s success will be determined by how thoughtfully and effectively we act upon the recommendations that follow.” DOC is currently planning another contract with Falcon to develop a framework to review the report’s key findings, and implement its recommendations. Although many of the changes will need to cover the entire DOC, Hoy said the state agency will also look at specific institutions to “reimagine” their functions, and begin implementing changes at five “pilot sites” before expanding to other facilities. 
Hoy took questions from corrections committee members. Public comment in response to the secretary’s presentation was not allowed. Lawmakers pointed out that the DOC remains overcrowded, with over 23,000 people spread across various prisons. Some highlighted the need for more uniformity among DOC policies across facilities, as well as a need for increased and centralized data analysis. 
Hoy acknowledged that there are ongoing problems with placing people in appropriate facilities, such as people who should be in minimum or medium-security prisons being placed in maximum security institutions, or people with severe mental health needs not being cared for adequately. He also noted that because DOC is generally a paramilitary organization, staff are often “craving” direction and vision from their leadership. Hoy said that there is more work to be done to change the culture among DOC staff, emphasizing that “we need to treat everybody with dignity and respect, to treat people as human beings, and see that person no matter whether they have a cap and gown and they’re graduating and ready to walk out the door, or if they’re sitting at rock bottom in restrictive housing, that they are still a human being.”
Hygiene and feminine product access in prison
The Corrections Committee also heard testimony on three bills which were open to public comment. One Republican bill (AB 297) would provide pay bonuses to DOC probation and parole officers based on their ability to increase employment rates among their clients under supervision. Rep. Benjamin Franklin (R – De Pere), the bill’s author and a member of the corrections committee, said the bill would help reduce the recidivism rate. Franklin was questioned by fellow lawmakers about whether the bill would adversely affect people who have small children at home, or who need to prioritize substance abuse treatment and mental health care over finding immediate employment. 
There were also questions about how probation and parole officers might abuse the incentive structure such as by creating revolving doors where clients get and lose jobs, only to be hired somewhere else, earning another bonus for their probation agent. 
The bill was backed by Cicero Action, a policy advocacy group whose board of directors is chaired by Joe Lonsdale, a billionaire co-founder of the data and surveillance company Palentir. Lonsdale has called for the use of public hangings to demonstrate “masculine leadership.”
Members of the public who attended the hearing, including members of the criminal justice reform advocacy groups Dream.org, Ladies of SCI, Ex-Incarcerated People Organizing, and others testified that people on probation and parole already have lives dictated by the whims of their agents. One woman gave an example of a formerly incarcerated loved one who had to take time out of their day for a three hour bus ride to check in with a probation agent for just a few minutes. Others shared firsthand experiences of being placed in unfulfilling jobs for which they were ill suited by their probation agents, or being discouraged from applying for certain kinds of work.

Two Democratic bills (AB 736 and AB 741) focused on increasing hygiene products across DOC facilities and expanding access to menstrual products for incarcerated women. Reps. Shelia Stubbs (D-Madison), Robyn Vining (D-Wauwatosa) and Sen. LaTonya Johnson (D-Milwaukee) presented the bills to the committee. 
Stubbs said that “good hygiene is both a matter of health and dignity, especially for those incarcerated.” AB 741 would require the DOC to provide culturally sensitive products ranging from shampoos to shaving cream, bar soap, natural conditioners, and other products through the commissary at no more than 125% of the price at the highest-grossing retail chain in Wisconsin, or no more than 100% of the sales price, depending on the product. Incarcerated people would also be given a $25 monthly stipend to help purchase hygiene products. The bill would also require sheriffs overseeing jails to provide a stipend and products to people held within jails. 
During testimony, some formerly incarcerated people  shared experiences of witnessing fellow incarcerated people fight because of bad hygiene. Family members of incarcerated people said that the costs to purchase commissary items, make phone calls and other expenses amount to unsustainable drains on their household budgets.

AB 736 would expand access to safe and appropriate menstrual products to incarcerated women. Although some prisons and jails take it upon themselves to provide such products to their residents, not all of them do so consistently nor do they provide a range of appropriate products. In some cases, women can bleed through their clothing in prisons and jails, creating embarrassing and awkward situations in which correctional staff may or may not be sympathetic to their needs. 
“In this way, menstruation becomes a monthly cycle of humiliation solely borne by women simply because they are women,” said Johnson. “And that’s not fair.” Johnson called providing menstrual products to incarcerated women “a minimum standard of care in more than two dozen states,” adding that the federal prison system guarantees women access to tampons and pads in correctional facilities. “States that have implemented these policies report minimal cost and improved conditions including fewer medical complications, fewer grievances, and safer, more sanitized facility environments.”
Lawmakers, as well as members of the public, pushed the committee to consider providing menstruation cups as well as more common products like tampons, and to evaluate whether products are safe or if they come with a risk of exposing incarcerated women to toxins. Many in the committee pointed out that if public bathrooms — including those in the Capitol — provide women with menstrual products for free, then why can’t jails and prisons? 
“For far too long meaningful conversations about menstruation have been avoided due to stigma, and it is my hope that as leaders in the state of Wisconsin, we can change that,” Vining said in a statement. “We need to talk about this issue now because women are one of the fastest growing populations in the U.S. And over the last 25 years, the number of women in Wisconsin’s prisons and jails has quadrupled. Our state jails and prisons, and their policies and programs, were simply not designed to safely and humanely incarcerate women.”

(Photo by GracedBytheLight/Getty Images)Rather than taking steps to reign in the clout of the growing poultry industry and protect the public, Oklahoma lawmakers have chosen to further deregulate and shield it from legal attacks.
This has given Big Agriculture and its corporate lobbyists license to despoil our natural resources, wreak havoc on our region’s waterways and exploit our state farmers.
The inflection point was reached in 2005 when then-Attorney General Drew Edmonson sued several large agricultural producers, including Tyson, Cargill, and Simmons Foods, that commonly contract with Oklahoma’s poultry farms. The lawsuit sought to hold these major poultry companies accountable for polluting the Illinois River Watershed with phosphorus from spreading chicken waste.
A trial was held in 2009, but it took 14 more years before U.S. District Judge Gregory Frizzell ruled for the state, finding the companies financially responsible for decades of pollution, ordering them to fund cleanup efforts, and imposing strict limits on poultry waste application to prevent further damage.
Despite no farmers being named as defendants in the case, the response from supporters of the poultry companies has been to redirect blame and portray the litigation as an attack on agriculture.
The issue has put Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt and Attorney General Gentner Drummond at odds. Drummond  continued to pursue the lawsuit while serving as state attorney general in order to ensure the companies were held liable. Stitt has sided with the poultry industry, recently meeting with producers in Adair County and saying the suit is only lining the pockets of the trial attorneys.
Tyson Foods, for their part, stated that if a sensible solution is not reached, it would be compelled to phase out its contracts with producers in the watershed. AG Drummond has called Tyson’s threats “gamesmanship” and part of a coordinated misinformation campaign by Tyson Foods to intimidate Oklahomans and deflect accountability. He said reports show Tyson is seeking to increase its production capacity in the watershed which contradicts claims that it has been forced to scale back operations due to the lawsuit.
What were the factors that helped to create and maintain this clash between corporate interests and the safeguarding of our environment that has transformed life for rural residents?
As many as 99.5% of U.S. chickens are raised by contract farmers for major processors, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture.
A few large companies like Tyson control the majority of the market, giving them immense leverage over farmers.
Farmers invest heavily in barns and equipment but receive payment based on short-term contracts, often in what’s known as a “tournament system” that pits them against each other for bonuses.
The system traps farmers in debt and limits their ability to find other buyers, especially as large processors control the processing plants.
In essence, while farmers own the land and buildings, the large corporations own the birds, feed, and market, creating a heavily controlled environment where most farmers are dependent on Big Ag.
Yet this begs the question of why these operators are often granted protections to escape responsibility for the damages they cause.
The answer is that Oklahoma’s regulatory environment, shaped by powerful agricultural interests, has prioritized and shielded large-scale poultry production.
The 2024 Oklahoma Legislature created a new law, Senate Bill 1424, that forbids property owners in the Illinois River Watershed whose lands and surface waterways have been polluted by runoff from poultry litter from pursuing legal action against contracted poultry growers unless an enforcement action has been taken by the Oklahoma Department of Agriculture, Food, and Forestry.
The law also provides legal immunity to poultry corporations.
Additionally, there are regulatory loopholes that have eased the path for large-scale operations.
Oklahoma allows many large industrial chicken farms to register as Poultry Feeding Operations rather than the more strictly regulated Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations. Poultry Feeding Operations have less restrictive setback requirements and do not require the same public notice to neighbors before construction.
Successful lobbying by the poultry industry in the 1990s also led to a loophole where a permit isn’t required if a property owner claims the water is for “domestic use” rather than for commercial purposes. As reported in the Arkansas Advocate, water usage is essentially unlimited. The state Water Resources Board relies on an honor system for water reporting, and the agency has never revoked a permit or penalized anyone for exceeding their allowed water usage.
HB 2053, which was passed in 2023, limits opposition to industrial water permits. The legislation’s clear intent, to which even the bill’s author, Republican state Sen. Brent Howard admitted, was to make it harder for people to oppose large poultry operations.
And in 2024, Stitt vetoed a HB 3194 that would have required metering devices on all groundwater wells across the state — a move praised by the agriculture industry and the Oklahoma Farm Bureau.
As lawmakers prepare to convene for the upcoming session next month, they will undoubtedly face continuing pressure to acquiesce to Big Ag interests.
I hope they will bear in mind that it’s possible for the poultry industry and clean water to coexist.
But as AG Drummond cautioned “what we cannot accept is allowing massive corporations to pollute our waterways without consequence.”

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)Two constitutional amendment proposals that could be on Wisconsinites’ ballots in November received public hearings on Tuesday, including one to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs from state and local governments and one to bar the governor from issuing partial vetoes that increase taxes. 
Constitutional amendment proposals in Wisconsin must pass the state Legislature in two consecutive sessions and receive majority approval from voters to become law. Each proposal is on its second consideration, meaning if they pass the Senate and Assembly, each would appear on voters’ ballots in November alongside a slate of consequential races including for governor, Congress and the state Legislature.
One of the proposed constitutional amendments, SJR 94, takes aim at DEI programs throughout state and local government in Wisconsin. Republicans have been targeting DEI programs for years and have at times found success, including when they elicited concessions from the University of Wisconsin system in 2023. 
If the proposal passed the Senate and Assembly, voters will see on their ballots the question “Shall section 27 of article I of the constitution be created to prohibit governmental entities in the state from discriminating against, or granting preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in public employment, public education, public contracting, or public administration?”
Sen. Steve Nass (R-Whitewater) told the Senate Licensing, Regulatory Reform, State and Federal Affairs Committee that the proposal would “ensure that we hire, promote, select, and admit people to our unit, public universities, schools and government agencies the same way we choose people for our Olympic team, military and sports teams — through merit, character, ability and hard work without regard to race, sex color, ethnicity or other immutable characteristics.” 
Sen. Dora Drake (D-Milwaukee) asked the authors of the proposal how they define “preferential treatment” and whether they know about the types of programs the amendment would eliminate.
“I don’t know how deep it is in hiring, contracting… I would say if the criteria for making your choice deals with race or sex, then that’s not appropriate,” Rep. Dave Murphy (R-Hortonville) said.
Drake brought up the state’s Supplier Diversity Program, which was established in the 1980s and certifies minority-owned, service-disabled veteran-owned and woman-owned businesses to provide better opportunities for them to do business with the state of Wisconsin. 
“Everyone should have access to opportunity. The reality is that our state historically has not shown that. That [program] was created because we have minority-owned businesses that were seeking opportunities for state contracting and they weren’t getting them, and that was based on relationships, it was based on race… and so this was implemented as a protective measure to ensure that people weren’t being discriminated against,” Drake said. “We’re pushing this forward when we still haven’t addressed what’s happening. If we’re doing this based on merit, then I would argue that there’s plenty of different minority-owned businesses that would be more than qualified, but they don’t get them, and you have to ask why.”
“They may be qualified, but are they the most qualified?” asked Sen. Chris Kapenga (R-Delafield). “And what this does is it takes away… the sex, the gender all of those items that the U.S. Constitution lays out as this is something that you can’t discriminate against. If you discriminate against a male because he’s a male, that’s still discrimination.” 
Dan Lennington, the Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty’s managing vice president and deputy counsel, said the bill would help to ensure that Wisconsin is “color blind.”
Lennington leads the conservative legal organization “Equality Under the Law Program,” and spoke to the number of lawsuits they’ve engaged in on the issue.
“We sued [former President] Joe Biden 12 times. We have five lawsuits pending against President [Donald] Trump right now based on race discrimination. We have a lot of things in the pipeline against the state of Wisconsin… We’d love to sue over the Minority Supplier Program. We haven’t gotten to it yet” Lennington said. “A constitutional amendment would, especially a new attorney general, would wipe all this clean and enforce the law as it’s already written, and would really help bring this to an abrupt end. Otherwise, there’s going to be decades more of this litigation.” 
Colbey Decker, a WILL client who alleges her white son who struggles with dyslexia faced racial discrimination in the Green Bay Area School District, testified in favor of the proposed amendment. The Trump administration launched an investigation into the school district over the allegations last year. 
Decker told the committee that her son wasn’t able to receive reading services because he is white, saying that she found that the school’s “success plan” included a policy related to “prioritizing resources to First Nations, Black and Hispanic students.”
“When an educational system’s moral compass is calibrated by a child’s skin color, the system has fundamentally failed. Our family’s story has forever changed after witnessing firsthand the casual callousness of sorting my son, color-coding him and then deprioritizing him based on his race,” Decker said. “The brutal reality of DEI is that it robs all children of the dignity and respect of individuality.” 
Curtailing executive partial veto power
SJR 116 would limit the governor’s partial veto power by prohibiting any vetoes from “creating or increasing or authorizing the creation or increase of any tax or fee.”
Lawmakers introduced the proposal last session in response to Gov. Tony Evers’ partial veto on the last state budget that extended school revenue increases for an additional 400 years. He did so by striking two digits and a dash from the years to extend the annual increases through 2425. The action was upheld by the state Supreme Court in April 2025. 
Rep. Amanda Nedweski (R-Pleasant Prairie) said the school revenue increases that are resulting from the partial veto are “unaffordable” and “unsustainable” for Wisconsinites.
“No governor, Republican or Democrat, should be able to single-handedly raise taxes on Wisconsin families with the stroke of his pen. The governor is not a king,” Nedweski said. “This constitutional amendment reigns in that power, restores the proper balance between the branches of government and ensures taxpayers are protected from runaway tax increases in the future.”
A recent Wisconsin Policy Forum report found that Wisconsin property taxpayers’ December bills included the highest increase since 2018 and warned property taxpayers could see similar increases to their property taxes in the future.
“We did all get a kick in the pants with property taxes this year… we’re gonna get another wack in 2026 in December,” Nass said during the hearing. 
Drake said the bill appeared to be a “grab for power.” 
Kapenga, one of the proposal authors, pushed back on the comment, saying if he were governor, he would sign a bill from Drake eliminating the governor’s ability to levy such a veto. 
“I do not like the power that the governor has in this state, regardless of who it is,” Kapenga said. “The power of the people should be vested in the Legislature, not in the executive branch.”
The question voters would see is: “Shall section 10 (1) (c) of article V of the constitution be amended to prohibit the governor, in exercising his or her partial veto authority, from creating or increasing or authorizing the creation or increase of any tax or fee?”
Constitutional amendments have been used to limit the partial veto power in a couple other scenarios, including in 1990 when voters approved the prohibition of the “Vanna White” veto, or eliminating single letters within words, and in 2008, when voters approved, eliminating the “Frankenstein veto” — or the ability for governors to create new sentences by combining parts of two or more sentences.

(Photo by Tom Davies/Indiana Capital Chronicle)The bruising Statehouse fight over Indiana congressional redistricting is looming over the formal start of the legislative campaign season.
Indiana’s month-long candidate filing period opened Wednesday — with Republican senators who opposed redrawing the maps braced for primary challengers and Democrats believing the issue will boost their chances to break the GOP’s supermajority hold on the Legislature.
The first-day filers included Sen. Travis Holdman, one of the top Republican Senate leaders and among those who voted against the redistricting bill demanded by President Donald Trump.
Trump, Gov. Mike Braun and Trump-aligned groups have vowed to support Republican primary challengers to lawmakers who weren’t on board.
Holdman, R-Markle, told the Indiana Capital Chronicle he knew pro-redistricting groups were “looking for somebody” to oppose his bid for a fifth term.
When asked whether the eight Republican senators who opposed redistricting and are poised to seek reelection this year were taking the primary threats seriously, Holdman simply replied: “Oh, yeah.”
Democrats see political hope
Democrats expressed enthusiasm for their chances this election cycle, with about two dozen joining in a mass-filing effort at the Statehouse for legislative seats organized by the Indiana Rural Summit Coalition.
Michelle Higgs, the coalition founder and a Democrat who is seeking the seat now held by Republican Rep. Peggy Mayfield of Martinsville, said the candidates would share technology and research in order to help their campaigns.
“We showed up at the Statehouse to lend our voices that redistricting was a power grab to remove power from the people,” Higgs said. “It will be part of every candidate’s campaign to bring power back to the people.”
A top goal of Democrats in 2026 is to pick up the four Indiana House seats they need to break the Republican two-thirds supermajority that allows them to take action even without Democrats being present.
Republicans now hold a 70-30 House majority and have had supermajority control since the 2012 elections. The GOP has a 40-10 hold on the Senate, where its supermajority has been in place since the 2010 elections.
Democratic House Caucus Chair Carey Hamilton said candidate recruitment hasn’t been as difficult as it was in past election cycles — and that the redistricting fight helped her party.
“It made people more aware of what’s going on at the Statehouse, and even more people kind of coming out of the woodwork wanting to be involved,” Hamilton said. “I think there are some folks who maybe were considering running, where it really kind of sealed the deal.”

While Democrats are looking to have serious candidates in more legislative races around the state, the focus starts on about a half-dozen districts that had tight outcomes in the 2024 elections.
One of those is the Bloomington-area district where Democrat Amy Oliver, an attorney and Brown County School Board member, is looking to challenge Republican Rep. Dave Hall after he won with 51% of the vote in 2024.
Oliver said Wednesday she believed the supermajority control has led to the public being locked out of the Legislature’s decision making.
“One-party rule is not good for anybody, I think, in either direction,” Oliver said. “We want to flip all those districts because it’s really important that they debate in public.”
Republican Senate primaries expected
The first day of candidate filings saw redistricting opponent Sen. Greg Walker, R-Columbus, reverse his previous decision to retire from the Legislature and enter the race for a fifth term.
Walker will face at least one Republican primary challenger in Rep. Michelle Davis, R-Whiteland, who supported the redistricting bill.
Redistricting could also be a key issue in the reelection bid of Republican Sen. Jim Buck of Kokomo, who filed for a fifth term after voting against the proposed new map. Tipton County Commissioner Tracey Powell filed to challenge Buck.
Republican former Sen. John Ruckelshaus, meanwhile, is seeking a Statehouse return by filing for the seat now held by Democratic Sen. J.D. Ford of Indianapolis. Ruckelshaus previously served an adjoining district during 2017-21.

That could become an open seat as Ford told the Capital Chronicle he was considering a run for the 5th Congressional District seat now held by Republican Rep. Victoria Spartz.
Republican Sen. Greg Goode of Terre Haute, who voted against redistricting and plans to seek reelection this year, expressed hope that the map debate will fade away.
“I’m optimistic, from the standpoint of this is now ’26 and we’ve got a lot of work that we ought to be focused on during this legislative session,” Goode said in an interview. “I personally want to move forward.”
Goode was among the legislators to face intimidation threats over redistricting, with a swatting call that brought police to his home hours after Trump called him out by name as a “RINO,” or “Republican in name only,” in a social media post.
Goode said he wasn’t thinking about who might run against him in the May primary.
“It’s a free country,” he said. “Everybody should have the opportunity to run.”

Sen. Julian Bradley (R-New Berlin) told the Senate Licensing, Regulatory Reform, State and Federal Affair[...]","""What major purchase does anyone in this room make without knowing the cost before you make the purchase? It is inconceivable to me that we do not know what something is going to cost of that magnitude before we actually consent to the cost,” Sen. Mary Felzkowski said.  (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)A bill to implement state-level enforcement of federal hospital price transparency requirements in Wisconsin, with the goal of bringing down the cost of health care, received pushback from hospital representatives and support from employers on Wednesday.
Sen. Julian Bradley (R-New Berlin) told the Senate Licensing, Regulatory Reform, State and Federal Affairs Committee that ensuring that the cost of services provided would help with health care affordability.  
“When hospitals clearly share pricing information, patients can make informed decisions. Trust in the system grows and costs come down naturally,” Bradley said, adding that the bill would ensure Wisconsin “reaps the benefits” of changes made by the Trump administration. 
During his first term, President Donald Trump’s administration implemented rules to require hospitals to post pricing information online. The effects of the changes on patients’ costs have been mixed. At the start of his second term, Trump signed an executive order intended to bolster the effort and in December, the administration proposed a new rule that aims to simplify how price data is organized and shared with people. 
SB 383 would instruct the Wisconsin Department of Health Services to enforce federal price transparency requirements for hospitals. 
Bradley and Rep. Robert Wittke (R-Caledonia), the bill coauthors, said it is needed to help ensure that federal policies are being followed.
“Sometimes we need to take action to make sure that it goes all the way through the state and all of our residents have access to the things that are expected through federal law,” Wittke said. 
Bradley said the lawmakers aren’t trying to penalize hospitals, just ensure people have access to information. 
If a hospital is found to be out of compliance under the bill, Wisconsin DHS would be able to take several actions including providing a written notice to the hospital, requesting a corrective action plan or imposing a financial penalty. DHS would also need to keep a public list of any hospitals that have violated the requirements.
Hospitals would also need to be certified as being in compliance with the requirements when seeking judgment from a court against a patient who owes a debt for services.
Lawmakers introduced a similar bill in 2023, but it failed to receive a floor vote in the Senate and advance in the Assembly.
The current version of the bill includes a provision that says that if federal laws change and are eliminated, then provisions in the bill that establish state level requirements for publishing prices will take effect.
Under those provisions, each hospital would need to make a list of “shoppable services” — ones that can be scheduled in advance such as a knee replacement — available with the standard charge for each item that would be publicly available. A hospital’s list would need to include at least 300 “shoppable services,” and if a hospital doesn’t provide that many, it must list all of its shoppable services.
The change is meant to avoid overlapping and varying requirements, though hospital representatives expressed concerns that would happen anyway.
The Wisconsin Hospital Association (WHA) opposes the bill. Christian Moran, the WHA vice president of Medicaid and payer reimbursement policy, said during the hearing that the organization’s opposition to the bill is not opposition to price transparency.
“Our opposition is to the added regulatory complexity that is created by layering on state level enforcement and state level regulations and unlimited fines on Wisconsin hospitals when robust federal regulation and enforcement already exists,” Moran said.
Moran said no Wisconsin hospitals have been fined for noncompliance since the first federal regulations went into effect. 
“Personal experience, it’s somewhat inevitable: if you pass legislation on the state level that mirrors the federal level it will eventually not match up,” John Russell, president and CEO of Prairie Ridge Health, said. 
Hospital representatives also expressed concerns that not enough attention was being given to the role of health insurance companies. 
“The solution proposed to you in [SB] 383 is to double up on existing enforcement for hospitals while ignoring the state’s current responsibility to enforce and monitor insurance compliance,” Moran said.
Brian Stephens, CEO of the Door County Medical Center, said the state should be more focused on the “middlemen” including insurance providers, saying that bolstering the transparency of hospital costs has its limitations. He spoke to the work that his medical center has done over many years to improve transparency of prices.
“There’s a disconnect in this country between the concerted efforts of health care providers to provide reasonable and transparent prices and the costs that people are paying for health insurance. Unfortunately, hospital price transparency efforts have not put a dent in that dichotomy,” Stephens said. “Perhaps we need to be asking for more transparency from health insurance companies and other middlemen to understand the real drivers of health care costs in our country. Perhaps hospitals have just become a good punching bag for folks who need an effective sound bite. The reality is that, despite our wholehearted commitment to providing reasonable upfront prices, transparency has its limitations. What are the odds that a person waking up with pain will take the time to bring out his or her phone and search the most affordable hospital or clinic prior to seeking treatment.”
Sen. Steve Nass (R-Whitewater) said the testimony focused on the insurance companies’ role sounded like “a lot of finger-pointing.” 
Several other states have adopted laws or are in the process of advancing bills to bolster price transparency including Colorado, Washington State and Ohio. 
Patrick Neville, a former Republican state representative in Colorado who helped pass a similar law in his state, testified on the Wisconsin bill, saying provisions in his home state have already helped. He told the story of one patient who was charged nearly $80,000 for a hysterectomy, but didn’t have to pay the cost.
“Because we had the consumer protections in this bill in Colorado, and they weren’t compliant with price transparency. They couldn’t actually collect that $80,000,” Neville said. “That was really important and powerful for the actual consumer in this case, and so it’s actually working in Colorado.” 
Neville added that the Colorado legislation did not codify the federal rules, but he wishes it had. 
“Any president could get rid of those rules at any point and I think the way this bill is crafted… It’s hugely important,” Neville said. “That’s a clever way to craft it.” 
Several employers testified in favor of the legislation. 
Erik Sonju, president of Fitchburg-based Power System Engineering, described the unpredictable jumps in health care costs that his company has grappled with since 2018 when he started in his position. He said that 2023 was the year the “straw broke” as they dealt with a 20% increase in insurance rates and he wasn’t able to get clear answers about the rising cost. 
Sen. Mary Felzkowski (R-Tomahawk) told the committee that the cost of health care is too high. 
“This is common sense. What major purchase does anyone in this room make without knowing the cost before you make the purchase? It is inconceivable to me that we do not know what something is going to cost of that magnitude before we actually consent to the cost,” Felzkowski said.  
Felzkowski is the lead coauthor on two of the other bills the committee took up. SB 796 would require insurers to submit information about claims to the Wisconsin Health Information Organization (WHIO), a nonprofit organization that collects health care claims data, and SB 797 would provide a $600,000 grant for the WHIO to establish an online dashboard of health care claims information and to add new payer data.
The committee also took testimony on SB 703, coauthored by Wittke and Sen. Rob Hutton (R-Brookfield), which would establish that employers who sponsor group health insurance plans have a right to data relating to the employees and dependents covered under those plans, including claims data, utilization reports and other information necessary to understand and manage health care costs.
Wittke said the bill will maintain privacy protections by requiring employers to designate a HIPAA compliance privacy officer and ensure that the Office of the Commissioner of Insurance maintains oversight. The bill also includes a provision prohibiting data from being sold to any party without the permission of the plan sponsor and the person to whom the claims data relates.

Prism Logistics' state leases are not subject to county regulations, judge rules, and the company's request for lease extensions is remanded back to the state.
The post Judge sides with developer of controversial Casper Mountain gravel pit appeared first on WyoFile .","The developer of a controversial gravel mining operation at the base of Casper Mountain has won two major legal challenges and says he is ready to begin mining as soon as possible.
Wyoming 7th District Court Judge Joshua C. Eames ruled Tuesday that Prism Logistics’ state land leases are not subject to county land use regulations, including a recent zoning change that would have blocked the industrial operation proposed next to a rural neighborhood on the west side of Casper. 
The judge also remanded back to the state Prism’s request to extend some of its leases, which the Wyoming State Board of Land Commissioners had denied last year.
Eames issued two separate rulings: one regarding the state’s denial of Prism’s lease extensions, and one regarding Natrona County’s authority over leasing actions on state lands.

The rulings follow nearly two years of intense opposition and legal wrangling over a proposed gravel mining operation that nearby homeowners, as well as residents throughout Natrona County, rallied against as harming a popular recreation area and threatening public health and safety. Opponents, including the Casper Mountain Preservation Alliance, convinced the county to rezone the area to prevent the operation — an action that helped convince some state land commissioners to deny Prism’s lease extension requests.
“Prism is very pleased with the rulings,” Prism Manager Kyle True told WyoFile on Wednesday, adding, “gravel operations are not inconsistent with a high quality of life, multiple use of Wyoming’s resources, including hiking and uses for education.”
Opponents, particularly the Casper Mountain Preservation Alliance, argued that mining operations might plague neighboring homes with dust, noise and heavy truck traffic. They also worry about how mining might impact shallow aquifers that residents rely on for water.


What are state trust lands?
Upon granting statehood in 1890, the federal government bestowed some 4.2 million acres of “state trust lands” to Wyoming, and it now manages about 3.4 million acres of trust land. The Wyoming Constitution prescribes that the primary use of those lands, which are scattered throughout the state in a checkerboard pattern, is to generate revenue to support public schools.
The Office of State Lands and Investments commonly leases those lands — often referred to as “school sections” — for grazing and industrial development such as mining and oil and gas drilling.


Complicating the issue is the fact that Prism is targeting a block of state trust lands, or “school sections,” that are prioritized to generate revenue for public schools and educational purposes. Often, that revenue-generation priority results in grazing and mining leases. Those state land priorities sometimes conflict with local uses and county health and safety rules.
The court’s ruling is disappointing, Casper Mountain Preservation Alliance cofounder Carolyn Griffith told WyoFile. “But I don’t think this is done,” she added, noting potential legal appeals and the fact that the State Board of Land Commissioners still has an opportunity to again deny Prism’s lease extension requests.
“Ultimately, I don’t know how it will go,” Griffith said, calling it “ludicrous” to allow a potential threat to a vital water resource. “The community is concerned because it’s the face of their mountain. It helps draw in some tourism to this community. It helps to retain some youth to the area because they use it for recreation.”

County zoning wasn’t the only issue at play in the state board’s denial of lease extensions. In June, Auditor Kristi Racines made the motion to reject Prism’s request to renew six of eight leases on the basis that Prism did not move forward on time with licensing and permits from the Department of Environmental Quality and Office of State Lands and Investments. 
If Prism ultimately prevails and is allowed to commence mining, True said, the company is prepared to begin mining immediately. If his hopes come to fruition, he said, opponents will find that “it will not have a significant, negative impact on anything.
“We struggle to see that the community will be harmed,” True added, “and we don’t think anything we’re doing is contrary to the public interest.” 
The State Board of Land Commissioners is composed of Gov. Mark Gordon, Superintendent of Public Instruction Megan Degenfelder, Secretary of State Chuck Gray, Treasurer Curt Meier and Auditor Racines.
Gray, who voted against renewing Prism’s state leases, issued a statement Wednesday condemning the court’s ruling as “outrageously wrong.” 
“This activist decision by an appointed judge needs to be appealed,” continued Gray, who recently announced his bid for the U.S. House of Representatives. “The State Board of Land Commissioners, elected by the people of Wyoming, made the correct decision to deny renewal of these leases in 2025. But now an activist judge is trying to force renewal of the leases, in direct contradiction with the Board’s decision.”
True took issue with Gray’s comments.
“I think this shows why Chuck Gray is generally unfit for statewide office,” True told WyoFile, “because he didn’t seem to read Judge Eames’ decision and respond to anything [in what is] quite a substantive decision. Instead, he stated his case with no new facts, but plenty of passion.”

The right to an abortion is protected by Wyoming's constitution, for now, but a constitutional amendment is on the horizon, warns guest columnist Britt Boril. 
The post The Wyoming Supreme Court made the correct decision on abortion appeared first on WyoFile .","On Tuesday, the Equality State lived up to its title.

Opinion

I shrieked when I read the opinion, teared up a bit and then my phone started blowing up. Texts, emails and notifications began rolling in from friends across the state and the country expressing unified joy. A simple truth we have long advocated for has been affirmed and spelled out in plain language by our Wyoming Supreme Court: Abortion is health care.
Now, I recognize that not everyone reacted with unbridled joy and relief. Abortion is an emotionally charged subject, one that, in an ideal world, would be approached with compassion, respect and recognition of the fact that pregnancy can sometimes be dangerous and filled with unforeseen complications. 
That is not how some of our elected officials chose to respond, with many instead lambasting the ruling and even attacking the justices themselves. Secretary of State Chuck Gray attempted to paint the justices as “leftwing activists” whose decision was “totally out of touch with the Wyoming Constitution.”
Might I suggest it is he who is totally out of touch?
In 2012, Wyoming voters passed an amendment to the state constitution — Article 1, Section 38 — which guarantees each competent adult “the right to make his or her own health care decisions.” Article 1 of the constitution establishes the core freedoms we all enjoy as Wyoming citizens. We, the people, chose to enshrine the right to make our own health care decisions as one of these core freedoms.
Although Justice Gray issued the sole dissenting opinion in the ruling, all five justices on the high court agreed that “the decision whether to terminate or continue a pregnancy is a health care decision under Article 1, Section 38.”
I am not an attorney or a constitutional scholar, and I will not attempt to provide a more detailed explanation as to why the abortion bans pushed by the state are unconstitutional. The justices provided a thorough and thoughtful 65-page explanation. 
I am a uterus-owning woman of birthing age who has found it incredibly difficult to attain basic reproductive health care in Wyoming.
I live in Casper, which has some of the “best” health care access in the state. Still, when I needed to seek routine care — not concerning pregnancy or abortion — the only provider I could find to see me in a reasonable timeframe was the Wellspring Health Access clinic. Wellspring is the only clinic in Wyoming to provide procedural abortions.
We are unbelievably fortunate to have Wellspring as a resource in our community. Almost half of our counties lack a practicing OB-GYN. The pause in labor and delivery services at Banner Platte County Hospital last fall marked the fourth labor and delivery ward closure since 2022 due to “physician recruitment challenges.”
As a vast state with a small population, we face obvious hurdles in recruiting medical talent. Uncertainty caused by abortion bans has hampered our ability to recruit even further. OB-GYNs do not want to practice in states where they face criminal penalties for providing the full standard of care, which includes abortion.
We have seen this horrifying reality play out in Idaho, which lost more than a third of its OB-GYNs between 2022 and 2024 after passing one of the strictest abortion bans in the country.
The Wyoming Legislature and the governor’s office are aware that our maternity care deserts present a major challenge to the state’s economy and standard of living. They’ve even identified maternal care as a policy priority. 
Yet, despite their purported interest in addressing the problem, their actions have repeatedly exacerbated our crisis. The Freedom Caucus consistently targets Wellspring for closure, a clinic that provides not just abortion care, but a full array of necessary reproductive care to our communities. 
How can we hope to attract and keep young families in the state if we cannot provide basic health services?
Instead of increasing Medicaid reimbursement rates for obstetrics (a third of births in Wyoming are covered by Medicaid) in the 2025 interim sessions, members of the Joint Labor, Health & Social Services committee chose to advance legislation that shields fake clinics from oversight.
And now the governor has called on the Legislature to propose a constitutional amendment during this year’s time-constrained budget session to specifically carve out abortion from health care protections.
As abortion bans have rolled out across the US since 2022, we have seen pregnant women suffer and die, even in states with supposed “exceptions” in their bans. The reasons a woman may need to seek an abortion are endlessly varied and unique to her situation. But most of all, they are none of the government’s business. 
Wyomingites already voted to keep the government out of our health care decisions. If we must vote on another constitutional amendment, I have confidence that the people will again decide to protect our freedom to make the best decisions for ourselves.

If the judiciary can shift the meaning of major words, then constitutional government becomes less a balance of powers and more a rule by judicial interpretation, writes guest columnist Nathan Winters.
The post When a court redefines ‘health care’ to include abortion, it redefines self-government appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming received a hard lesson this week, not only about abortion, but about how the redefinition of a single word can quietly decide a moral debate and shift power away from voters.

Opinion

On Tuesday, the Wyoming Supreme Court affirmed a lower court ruling that contended that “the decision to have an abortion is a health care decision.” That statement is anything but a routine legal conclusion. It is a choice about meaning, one with consequences far beyond this case.
In politics, people often try to win arguments by changing the meaning of words. If you can rename something, you can make it sound safer, kinder and less controversial.
But a label does not change reality. Calling abortion “health care” is not just describing a medical procedure. It is also making a moral claim: that abortion belongs in the same category as care that heals and protects patients.
So, the essential question becomes painfully simple: Is it honest to treat a procedure that intentionally ends an unborn human life as ordinary “health care,” simply because it occurs in a medical setting?
Most average voters, whatever their party, know instinctively that not everything performed by a professional is automatically “care” in the moral sense. The white coat does not sanctify the act. “Medical” can describe who performs a procedure; “care” describes what it is for. In common-sense terms, care aims to heal and protect patients. Abortion, by its nature, ends a life.
That is why the high court’s definition matters. Once abortion is judicially placed inside “health care,” restrictions face the highest hurdles.
Natural law begins with a simple idea: Basic rights do not come from the strong. They are grounded in what a human being is.
If the unborn child is a living human being, then that child has at least one right that society must protect: the right not to be intentionally killed.
This straightforward truth doesn’t rely on having the same religious beliefs. It’s simply a matter of human rights. All the great struggles for justice come back to the same fundamental idea: Every person’s dignity is not about how big, strong, smart or independent they are, or whether others see that person as convenient.
That’s exactly why the law exists. The law protects people who cannot protect themselves.
So, when a court treats abortion as a protected “health care decision,” it is not protecting “choice.” It is deciding, implicitly, that the unborn child is not the sort of being the law must protect in the first place, or at least not enough to outweigh the mother’s claim. That’s a moral decision. It deserves public debate, not a quiet redefinition from unelected judges.
Yet there is also another issue at stake that should alarm even people who are conflicted about abortion: the separation of powers.
The founders of our constitutional order, state and federal, assumed something basic: Law in a self-governing republic is made by elected representatives. Courts interpret law; they do not rewrite it. Legislatures debate definitions precisely because definitions carry moral weight. That is why statutes contain words like “reasonable,” “necessary,” “public welfare” and “compelling interest.” These are not mere technicalities; they are the guardrails of representative government.
Wyoming’s Article 1, Section 38 includes an explicit legislative role: “The legislature may determine reasonable and necessary restrictions on the rights granted under this section to protect the health and general welfare of the people.”
Yet this ruling effectively places abortion restrictions under strict scrutiny, the most demanding constitutional standard, by treating abortion itself as a protected “health care decision.” This shifts the practical center of gravity away from the Legislature and toward the judiciary. When judges, rather than voters through their representatives, decide what constitutes “health care,” the judiciary begins to dominate the other branches.
To be clear: Courts must interpret constitutions. But there is a difference between interpretation and transformation. When broad language is used to constitutionalize an issue as morally explosive as abortion, it is fair to ask whether the court has created a new rule of political life without the consent of the governed.
Thankfully, one of the judges, Kari Gray, provided a powerful dissent to the ruling, arguing that the Legislature was operating within its constitutional authority when it, as the elected representatives of the people, placed “reasonable and necessary” restrictions on abortions. That dissent is not just legal quarreling. It is a warning about which branch gets the last word.
If the judiciary can expand or contract the meaning of major words, then constitutional government becomes less a balance of powers and more a rule by judicial interpretation. And the branch least accountable to voters becomes the branch most decisive in moral policy.
If Wyoming wants abortion protected as “health care,” let that be said plainly, debated openly, and, if necessary, resolved through the democratic process the constitution provides.
The answer is not to pretend that words settle moral reality. For a republic to survive, citizens must insist on two virtues: truthful language and separated powers. Lose either one, and self-government becomes nothing more than a slogan.

Brad Little gives his annual State of the State address on Jan. 6, 2025, on the House floor at the Statehouse in Boise. (Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)Idaho House Speaker Mike Moyle said he expects Idaho to conform to many of the federal tax changes championed by President Donald Trump, and he expects the Idaho Legislature to pass additional budget cuts during the upcoming 2026 legislative session to pay for the tax cuts and avoid a budget deficit.

The two related issues – whether to conform with federal tax cuts included in the federal One Big Beautiful Bill Act that Trump signed into law July 4 and how to avoid projected multimillion Idaho state budget deficits in fiscal years 2026 and 2027 – are expected to be two of the biggest issues shaping the annual Idaho legislative session that begins Monday at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise. 
Moyle, other legislators and officials in Gov. Brad Little’s office have all said Idaho will intervene during the 2026 legislative session to prevent the state from posting a budget deficit when the fiscal year ends June 30. And to avoid the shortfalls, legislators are going to propose new, additional budget cuts. 
“There’s going to be some reductions in the budget, and there’s plenty of room for reductions in budgets,” Moyle said in an interview Monday at the Idaho State Capitol. “If you don’t think so, ask any farmer out in the state of Idaho that’s dealing with lower commodity prices, right? Just go find the stuff that doesn’t matter, and you take it out. So I think it can be done easily if we work together. 
“But the part that is going to be the problem is that every budget has somebody that thinks it’s the best budget in the state and has to have everything, and that creates more of those conflicts and makes it harder to get out of here.”
Idaho House Speaker Mike Moyle, R-Star, answers a reporter’s question during a press conference on Jan. 6, 2025, at the Statehouse in Boise. (Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)
The latest state reports show that Idaho is projected to end the current fiscal year 2026 on June 30 with a state budget deficit of $40.3 million, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. But the projected budget and revenue shortfalls are not a short-term, one-year problem facing the Idaho Legislature. The Idaho Legislative Services Office reported in the fall that next year’s fiscal year 2027 state budget is projected to have a $555.2 million budget deficit. Longer range state reports also showed a projected gap between expenses and revenues continuing through fiscal year 2028.
Any projected budget deficit is a problem because the Idaho Constitution requires the state to pass a balanced budget every year and prohibits the state from running a budget deficit where expenses exceed state revenues. 
 Idaho’s speaker of the House said repealing Medicaid expansion is on the table this year

To pay for balancing the budget, Moyle said legislators will consider repealing Medicaid expansion, which more than 60% of Idaho voters approved at the polls in November 2018. Medicaid expansion provides health insurance to more than 85,000 Idahoans who did not qualify for traditional Medicaid, with the federal government paying 90% of the benefits and the state paying the remaining 10%, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported.
In December, the Idaho Legislature’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE Committee, issued a recommendation for Idaho to repeal Medicaid expansion. 
On Monday, Moyle said repeating Medicaid expansion is on the table for this year, but he is unsure how much money eliminating Medicaid expansion would save the state budget.
“Heck yeah (it’s on the table),” Moyle said Monday. “I don’t have a problem with that. Everything is on the table. I don’t have a problem with that at all.”
Even though Idaho voters approved Medicaid expansion via a ballot initiative in 2018, the Idaho Legislature still has the power to repeal Medicaid expansion, which is treated the same as any other law in Idaho that can be amended or repealed. 
Sen. Scott Grow, an Eagle Republican who serves as the co-chair of the Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, said he also expects additional budget cuts this year, although he did not predict where the cuts will come from. The Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, or JFAC for short, sets every budget for every state agency and department each year. 
“Obviously it will be a challenging session for JFAC,” Grow said in a phone interview. “With the tapering off of revenue increases that we have experienced over the last several years, we are now coming back to a more normal year. But, in fact, this particular year is a little less normal, in that we will have to look at cutting budgets rather than the increases that have been able to happen over the last few years.”
“We will wait and see what the governor’s budget (recommendation) is, obviously but I am confident that in accordance with 3% holdback (Little) has already done, we will have to deal with cuts and some of those cuts may need to be larger than 3% in order to balance the budget,” Grow added. 
House Minority Leader Ilana Rubel, D-Boise, said Idaho’s budget shortfall is an entirely self-inflicted crisis that was brought on by Republicans in the Idaho Legislature passing years worth of tax cuts the state could not afford and delaying setting revenue projections until after the Idaho Legislature passed several major budgets and tax cuts. 
Rubel opposes repealing Medicaid expansion and opposes additional new cuts to programs and services that Idahoans rely on. Instead of cutting services that benefit low income families, seniors and people with disabilities, Rubel said the Idaho Legislature should instead repeal the most recent income tax cuts and repeal a new $50 million education tax credit that reimburses families for expenses including tuition at private, religious schools.

But with Republicans controlling supermajorities in both chambers of the Idaho Legislature, Rubel worries more and deeper cuts to programs and services are on the way.
“The repercussions of the cuts will be felt far beyond the vulnerable communities who took the hit on the front end,” Rubel said in a December phone interview. “It’s going to hit regular people. It’s going to hit them a lot harder in the very near future, and they are going to want answers.” 
 

	Federal tax changes championed by Trump could cost Idaho hundreds of millions of dollars    

Importantly, Idaho’s projected $40.3 million deficit for fiscal year 2026 and projected $555.2 million deficit for next year do not include the cost of paying for tax changes in Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill. For individuals, some of those tax changes include no tax on workers’ overtime pay, no tax on workers’ tips, no tax on borrowers’ car loan interest and an expanded deduction for senior citizens. If Idaho adopts those changes at the state level, making the changes will reduce state revenue even more.
“First off, when we left last year (when the 2025 legislative session adjourned), we left $430 million on the bottom line,” Moyle said. “We didn’t have a problem until July 1, when the Big, Beautiful Bill passed. If you didn’t have the Big Beautiful Bill, we wouldn’t be having this conversation with concerns about a shortfall that was created by the actions of the federal side that we have no control of. Tax conformity is what’s driving the numbers down. There are 39 tax relief components in the Big Beautiful Bill that affect Idaho.”
It is not exactly clear how much conforming to Trump’s tax changes would cost Idaho. A report from the nonprofit Tax Foundation estimated it could cost $284 million annually to conform to the individual and business tax changes in Idaho. 
On Monday, Moyle told the Sun the cost of tax conformity could actually be closer to $400 million in Idaho. 
Either way, Moyle said he expects Idaho to conform to most of the federal tax changes. 
“How we address that will have a lot to do with the budget too,” Moyle said. “That means, if we conform, and I believe we conform to most, if not all of them – most of them, for sure –  if we conform to those, now we’ve got a revenue situation, right?”
Moyle said he does not think Idaho legislators will need to cut funding for the K-12 public school system because student enrollment in public schools has declined and costs will be less as a result. But Moyle said cuts in other areas are all on the table.
“We’ll figure it out,” Moyle said. 
Little will begin the 2026 legislative session Monday when he delivers the annual State of the State address and issues his budget recommendations at 1 p.m. Monday at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise. Little’s address, as well as legislative committee meetings and Idaho House and Idaho Senate floor sessions will again be streamed live online, for free, via the Idaho in Session streaming service.

Efforts to impose accountability for those responsible and those involved have largely ended — except in Wisconsin. This means that Wisconsin has the opportunity, and the responsibility, to re-assert the rule of law, to ensure justice, and to bolster the foundations on which American democracy has been built over the past 250 years.
As we assess the state of our democracy in light of this somber anniversary, let’s start with the bad news: 

The U.S. Supreme Court derailed efforts by states to enforce the 14th Amendment’s prohibition against insurrectionists serving in federal office, and then it invented an ahistorical and jaw-droppingly broad doctrine of presidential immunity to derail criminal prosecutions of Trump in state and federal courts alike. 
Federal prosecutions of the violent mob in the Capitol were upended by Trump’s Department of Justice, and Trump issued sweeping federal pardons to every individual connected with Jan. 6, effectively encouraging them to keep it up. 
State prosecutions of the fraudulent electors — those who executed an unprecedented effort to overturn the 2020 election by submitting to Congress (and other officials) paperwork that falsely declared Trump to have won seven key states that he in fact lost and thereby laying the groundwork for the Jan. 6 rioters to violently demand Pence validate their efforts — have faltered, often for reasons unrelated to the merits of those actions. 

But here in Wisconsin there are still grounds for hope. Hope that bad actors who deliberately took aim at our democracy will be held accountable. Hope that our institutions will stand up and protect our democracy from further meddling by those most directly responsible. And hope that those institutions will act promptly to prevent further damage. Every Wisconsinite should be watching the following accountability efforts — and urging our elected officials to use their authority to advance the rule of law and protect our democracy. 
First, the Wisconsin Supreme Court will soon determine the appropriate sanction for Michael Gableman’s ethical transgressions as he spearheaded a sham “investigation” of the 2020 election. Gableman, who once served on the Wisconsin Supreme Court, accepted this job despite his own assessment that he did not understand how elections work in Wisconsin. He wasted taxpayer funds, undermined government transparency laws, dealt dishonestly with his clients and the public, lied to and insulted courts, and tried to jail the elected mayors of Green Bay and Madison. In March 2023, Law Forward filed an omnibus ethics grievance, documenting Gableman’s myriad breaches of the ethics rules that bind all Wisconsin attorneys. Last summer, Gableman stipulated that he had no viable defense of his conduct and agreed with the Office of Lawyer Regulation to jointly recommend his law license be suspended for three years. (He is now trying to wriggle out of accountability by serially pushing justice after justice to recuse.) 
Wisconsin precedent is clear that, where a lawyer is charged with multiple ethical breaches, the proper sanction is determined by adding the sanctions for each breach together. The Court should apply established law, which demands revoking Gableman’s law license. Then the Office of Lawyer Regulation and the Court should act on our requests to hold Andrew Hitt (chairman of the Wisconsin fraudulent electors) and Jim Troupis (chief Wisconsin counsel to Trump’s 2020 campaign and ringleader of the fraudulent-elector scheme) accountable as well.
Second, the primary architects of the fraudulent-elector scheme, detailed in records  obtained through Law Forward’s groundbreaking civil suit, are also facing criminal prosecution in Dane County. Attorney General Josh Kaul’s case is narrowly focused only on three lawyers — two who were based here in Wisconsin, and one working for the Trump campaign in DC — who conceived and designed the scheme to overturn Wisconsin’s results and then convinced six other states to follow suit. Troupis, who himself was appointed to the Wisconsin bench by former-Gov. Scott Walker as a reward for his key role in the 2011 partisan gerrymander, has gone to great lengths to slow down this prosecution, which Kaul initiated in June 2024. He filed nine separate motions to dismiss the case. He accused the judge hearing preliminary motions of misconduct and insisted that the entire Dane County bench should be recused. And now he has appealed the denial of his misconduct allegations. This case, since assigned to a different Dane County judge, will proceed, and it is the best hope anywhere in the country to achieve accountability for the fraudulent-elector scheme. 
Third, on behalf of the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign and two individual voters, Law Forward is suing Elon Musk and two advocacy organizations he controls for their brazen scheme of million-dollar giveaways to influence the 2025 Wisconsin Supreme Court election. This case is about ensuring that Wisconsin elections are decided by Wisconsin voters, not by out-of-state efforts to buy the results they want for us. We’re waiting for the trial court to decide preliminary motions, but, with another Wisconsin Supreme Court election imminently approaching, there is urgency to clarify that Wisconsin law forbids the shenanigans we saw last year, which contributed to the most expensive judicial race in American history. 
Beginning in 2011, Wisconsin became the country’s primary testing ground for the most radical anti-democratic ideas. From Act 10 to one of the strictest voter ID laws in the country, from subverting the separation of powers and steamrolling local control over local issues to hobbling the regulatory state and starving our public schools, Wisconsin’s gerrymandered Legislature adopted idea after idea hostile to democracy. With the end of the nation’s most extreme and durable partisan gerrymander in 2023 and a change in the makeup of the state Supreme Court, however, the tide in Wisconsin has ebbed somewhat. 
Now, improbably, Wisconsin is the place that democracy can best hold the line. We can create accountability for those who have abused power, have undermined elections, and have diminished the ideals and institutions of our self-government. That, in conjunction with Law Forward’s broad docket of work to defend free elections and to strengthen our democracy, sustains my hope.

Colorado will not get money for its Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, Social Services Block Grant and Colorado Child Care and Development Fund programs while the federal government conducts a “thorough review of the State’s use of funding for compliance and alignment with statutory requirements,” according to letters sent Tuesday from the Administration for Children and Families, part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
Colorado is one of five Democratic-led states that are on a funding freeze totaling $10 billion for the three program.

Federal officials are concerned with the “potential for extensive and systemic fraud” in the programs that receive federal funding, and they claim to have evidence the state is illegally dispersing funds, according to the letters. They do not detail any specific incidents or allegations of fraud.
“These concerns have been heightened by recent federal prosecutions and additional allegations that substantial portions of federal resources were fraudulently diverted away from the American families they were intended to assist. Additionally, ACF has reason to believe that the State of Colorado is illicitly providing illegal aliens with (benefits) intended for American citizens
and lawful permanent residents,” the letter regarding SSBG benefits reads. The three letters, one for each program. are nearly identical.
The funding freeze follows a surge of fraud cases in Minnesota involving misuse of government funds for safety-net programs. There have not been comparable fraud charges or allegations in Colorado.
The federal government is requesting the “complete universe” of administrative data for recipients of TANF, known in the state as Colorado Works, and SSBG benefits since 2022, including recipient names, addresses, Social Security Numbers, dates of birth, A-numbers and any other state identification numbers. An A-number is a registration number that U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement assigns to immigrants for official records.
Officials are also asking Colorado to document how it verifies citizenship of beneficiaries according to federal eligibility rules. And they want information about which organizations received SSBG and TANF dollars since 2019 and how they used the money.
Alex J. Adams, the assistant secretary for the Administration for Children and Families, wrote in the letters that the administration wants this information by Jan. 20.
“These actions by the Trump administration will hurt vulnerable Coloradans across every part of this state,” Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement. “This important help for lower income families is administered by the counties and the sweeping data demands this request would place on counties — especially on short and impossible timelines — are unrealistic and risk disrupting services. No child should go without food, stability, or opportunity because of punitive federal action, and we are exploring all options to make sure Colorado children and families are supported.”
His office did not immediately respond to a question of whether the state would give information about A-numbers and its citizenship verification process.
Colorado receives about $136 million in TANF block grant funding annually, according to the Colorado Department of Human Services. Last December, over 14,000 families benefited.
For the child care funding, Colorado must immediately implement “additional fiscal accountability requirements” including submission of attendance documentation.
“CDHS is currently reviewing the requirements and assessing the potential impacts these will have on Coloradans,” CDHS spokesperson Haysel Hernandez wrote in an email. “The department remains committed to Colorado families and providing critical aid in their time of need.”
The letters do not indicate how long reviews by the federal government could take.

(Photo: Cassandra Stephenson)On the first day that Dan and Zita Elrod stepped foot on a plot of wooded land with a cabin overlooking the Duck River, they spotted an eagle in flight from the back porch.
They were in the market for a peaceful respite from city life, and they took the eagle as a sign. They were sold.
In 2025, nearly two decades later, the couple decided they wanted to preserve the property. They entered into a conservation easement, a voluntary legal agreement between a landowner and a land trust that conserves property by permanently restricting how that land can be used.
The Elrods’ roughly 42 acres overlooking the most biodiverse freshwater river in North America will remain just as they want it — a cabin surrounded by acres of forest — in perpetuity, even if the Elrods decide to sell or bequeath the land some day.
“This is one of the few opportunities you have in this world to do something that’s permanent,” Dan Elrod told the Lookout.
The Elrods’ land is among thousands of acres conserved in 2025 through sales and partnerships with land trusts, conservation organizations and state agencies. 
That protected land includes more than 7,400 acres of bottomland hardwood forest along the Hatchie River that is now a wildlife management area in West Tennessee — a property that multiple land trusts, nonprofits and state agencies worked for years to secure.
Land conserved by private citizens like the Elrods through conservation easements also makes up thousands of the total acres protected in the last year, according to The Land Trust for Tennessee and TennGreen Land Conservancy, nonprofits that work with landowners to preserve natural resources and farmland.










It feels bigger than you. That involves the whole community, that involves the whole state, and that’s something that anybody in the world can come visit and appreciate and realize, wow, this stuff is really worth protecting.


– Jon D. Bumpus, TennGreen


TennGreen Director of Communications Jon D. Bumpus said the organization preserved roughly 3,200 acres in 2025 through a combination of voluntary, landowner-driven conservation easements and land acquisitions. The Land Trust for Tennessee conserved just under 1,000 acres with private landowners last year, mostly in Middle Tennessee, the trust’s Senior Conservation Project Manager Jackson Lundy said.
These properties contain forests, rivers, pastures, a waterfall and habitats for rare, threatened and endangered species. They also have deep personal value to their owners, many of whom seek conservation easements to ensure their land retains its character for future generations, Bumpus and Lundy said.
Both organizations are hopeful that the Farmland Preservation Act — a law passed by the Tennessee General Assembly in 2025 that sets aside $25 million for grants for farmland and forest owners who place their land in conservation easements — will open the door for more landowners once the grant program is finalized this year.
A public rule-making hearing for the act is scheduled for Feb. 12.
“We’ve been overwhelmed with interest,” Lundy said.
How conservation easements work
The Elrods partnered with The Land Trust for Tennessee for their conservation easement, which took about six months to complete. 
Every conservation easement is different, with restrictions on the land created with the landowner “to fit their needs and their desires for how they want their property to be used in the future,” Lundy said.
Easements may restrict the land from being used for certain types of development, like subdivisions, but can still allow farm activity, agricultural buildings, and even timber harvesting, so long as it’s done in keeping with forest management best practices. Each agreement is specific to the land in question, the landowners’ future goals and the land trust’s conservation goals.
“I think a lot of landowners understandably have a visceral reluctance to do something that’s going to really affect (their) land, or that’s going to tie (them) up or take away options,” Dan Elrod said. “Well, you can maintain options as you want to in the process. There’s a lot more flexibility than folks realize.”
Lundy said The Land Trust for Tennessee wants to make as many things available to landowners as possible for future use, but if someone wants to build 20 houses on their farm, “that might not be a good fit for a conservation easement.”
Once the ink dries, the landowners retain ownership of their land.
“They can sell it, they can pass it to heirs, but the conservation easement stays with the deed of the property so that whoever owns it in the future still has to uphold the conservation values that we agreed on,” Amy Frankel, marketing and communications manager for The Land Trust, said.
Lundy works with landowners who are interested in conservation easements and helps them through the process. Last year, he received more than 400 inquiries. The organization uses a screening process that considers farmland use, climate change resilience, water quality, wildlife habitat, historic sites, scenic land and other attributes to determine which projects will best serve The Land Trust’s conservation goals.
After the easement is official, The Land Trust continues to work with landowners to ensure those terms are maintained. They visit each property every year to monitor conditions and keep a relationship with the landowner. In total, The Land Trust has conserved roughly 137,000 across more than 460 conservation easements since its inception in 1999.
If a land trust or conservation easement holder ceases to operate, easements can be legally transferred to another entity to continue stewardship.
Bumpus describes conservation easements as the closest to a “forever clause” a landowner can get.
“It’s not something that can be circumnavigated by state or federal institutions, through the government that we have in place now,” Bumpus said.
Conservation easements do come with costs for the land surveys, appraisals and attorney services needed to put them into place. Landowners who enter into conservation easements may be eligible for tax benefits, but up-front costs can be barriers for some who would otherwise be interested.
Bumpus said he’s looking forward to the release of grant funding from the Farmland Protection Act, which could cover those costs and allow farmers to protect their land for free. 
“That is one of the things that makes me emotional, getting to do this work, because so many of my friends that are in agriculture … they’re very land rich … but it’s so hard to run agriculture in Tennessee, and America in general, (that) you’re not able to save money on the side,” said Bumpus, who owns a small ranch in Goodlettsville where he raises cattle.
“We’ve helped with some funding for conservation easements on agricultural land before, and it’s an unreal feeling,” he said. “It gives me goosebumps every time I think about it, looking someone in the eyes who’s been on their land for 90 years, and it’s seven generations old, and telling them they’re not going to lose it, is, I think, the most powerful thing I’ve ever been a part of.”
Land purchases and state parks
Organizations like TennGreen, The Nature Conservancy in Tennessee and many others also work to conserve land through acquisitions, often pooling resources with each other to purchase land at risk of development.
Bumpus said TennGreen had a nearly even split of conservation easements and acquisitions last year, but the mix varies from year to year. The Nature Conservancy in Tennessee mostly conserves land through acquisitions — purchasing properties from willing sellers. 
The Nature Conservancy in Tennessee chooses tracts of land based on biological diversity and the land’s resistance to climate change, Director of Land Gabby Lynch said.
She cites the Hatchie Bottoms project in West Tennessee as 2025’s “major exciting, uplifting win.”
“It’s one of those lifetime projects that you want to live to see happen, and it happened in 2025,” she said.
Multiple partners, including The Nature Conservancy, TennGreen, The Conservation Fund, Hatchie River Conservancy, Heritage Conservation Trust Fund, and Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency worked on the Hatchie expansion. 
Land trusts and conservation organizations frequently work with state and federal agencies to acquire properties near parks, natural areas, wildlife refuges and management areas. Bumpus said conservation organizations are more nimble and can often purchase land and hold it so the state can turn it into a state park later, when it secures funds and clears red tape.
Tennessee opened its newest state park, Head of the Crow, in Franklin County in October 2025, made possible by more than a decade of work from conservation organizations and state agencies. 
The park is now one of three parks in an area formerly known as South Cumberland State Park, which grew to protect more than 30,000 acres. Fiery Gizzard State Park in Grundy and Marion counties was also recognized as a distinct park in 2025.
Bumpus said a highlight of his year was attending the parks’ dedications.
“It feels bigger than you,” he said. “That involves the whole community, that involves the whole state, and that’s something that anybody in the world can come visit and appreciate and realize, wow, this stuff is really worth protecting.”
The Nature Conservancy in Tennessee is working toward protecting 50,000 new acres from 2020 to 2030. After 2025, they have protected about 80% of that goal, meaning they’re “ahead of schedule,” Lynch noted.
The Nature Conservancy began in 1978, and the Tennessee chapter also aims to reach a grand total of 500,000 acres of protected land throughout the state by 2030. They are now nearing 470,000 acres.
While Tennessee continues to grow, Lynch said she has a personal hope going into 2026 for Tennesseans.
“I would love if all of us who walk on this beautiful state that we live in really knew how special Tennessee is, because Tennessee has a lot of superlatives when we talk about biological diversity and climate change resilient habitats,” she said. It’s important, “not just for within the borders of Tennessee, but we’re actually a regionally important conservation state.”

But in 2026, the job market will be tight – and for new graduates, there’s growing competition from artificial intelligence.
The National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) Job Outlook survey projects hiring levels for new grads will increase just 1.6% in 2026 after remaining flat in 2025. In that same survey, 45% of employers rated the job market as “fair.”

UPS, Target, and Amazon were among the high-profile companies that announced plans to shed thousands of jobs in the 4th quarter of last year.
And it’s unclear if those jobs will return any time soon.
“I think what you’re talking about there, with respect to some of these large companies making layoffs, it’s AI generated,” said North Carolina State University economist Mike Walden in an interview with NC Newsline.
“We are now seeing AI deployed more, at least planning to be deployed more, into a variety of enterprises,” Walden said.”I think they’re looking at their payroll, they’re looking at employment. And we’ve seen multi-thousands of employee cutback announcements already made.”
Walden believes this is going to be a challenge for prospective employees for the next couple of decades.
Careers that are projected to see major disruptions include: marketing and public relations, interpreters and translators, customer service representatives, and web developers.

“It’s going to bring great productivity. It’s going to probably bring great abilities for a lot of companies to do things they couldn’t have done before. But it may come at a price in terms of less employment or different kinds of employment,” said Walden.
A report by outplacement and executive coaching firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas found U.S. employers announced more than 71,000 job cuts in November. While restructuring was the top reason given for shedding jobs, AI was cited for 6,280 jobs cut in November and more than 54,000 layoffs last year.
Walden says AI is notably different from any technology we’ve seen over the last hundred years.
“Usually when you think about new technologies, it’s been technologies that replace what I call brawn with a machine. AI is different because it’s replacing cognitive ability, not strength. And in the 21st century, that’s the basis of a lot of jobs,” Walden told NC Newsline.“People get trained in colleges to think, to analyze, to do analysis, to do programming, et cetera. And we’re going to see a lot of that change with a lot of those tasks shifted to AI.”
Improving employability in an AI world 
The key to making a job more AI-resistant may lie in soft skills.
Sumana Northover, Northeastern University (Photo: Northeastern.edu)
Sumana Northover, director of Employer Engagement and Career Design at Northeastern University, believes recent grads and job-seekers who can demonstrate competencies such as critical thinking, clear communication, leadership and teamwork will find it easier to make the transition from college to career.
“What’s interesting is that nationally, students rate themselves higher on these competencies than actual employers rate students,” said Northover during a recent webinar sponsored by The Hunt Institute.
Chelle Travis, executive director of SkillsUSA, agrees that students really need to work on those skills to better understand their strengths and weaknesses.
“I was on a panel not long ago where one of our industry partners said that they are often hiring for technical skills, but they’re firing for soft skills,” said Travis.
Travis said by normalizing work-based learning opportunities, students are more likely to have a leg up on any competition.
“Across this country, we should see students that are participating in internships, apprenticeships, mentorships or other programs that develop graduates with higher confidence, clarity, and employability,” she said.
 Artificial intelligence shapes higher education  
UNC System President Peter Hans has also spent a great deal of time thinking about how artificial intelligence will shape today’s students and tomorrow’s workforce.
“I worry that for every promise AI holds for teaching and learning, it poses an equal threat to motivation and mental effort,” Hans told members of the UNC Board of Governors at their September meeting. “It’s one thing to make use of an AI tool when you’ve already had years of experience honing your mind and your work ethic. But having access to a mental shortcut from your earliest days as a student — an easy button you can press any time things get tough — is a tempting invitation to mediocrity.”
UNC System President Peter Hans says a new Chief AI Officer will oversee AI strategy for the 17-campus system. (Photo: UNC/PBSNC video stream)
Hans said a Chief AI Officer will oversee AI strategy for the 17-campus system. Earlier this month, UNC instructors were invited to help pilot new student AI literacy training modules created by a team of faculty, librarians, and instructional designers for use during the Spring 2026 semester.
“There are already indications that AI is eroding entry-level jobs in fields like computer programming, with more on the way. We have an obligation to deliver the most relevant, most valuable degree possible for our students, and that means closely monitoring the way emerging technology is changing our economy and our society,” said Hans.
That understanding is essential. A new NBC News poll finds nearly two-thirds of registered voters question whether getting a four-year college education was worth the cost given the large amount of debt many students incur. Only one-third agreed the cost was worth it to have a better chance of landing a good job and earning more over their lifetime.
Walden said some students are making that decision because they don’t know if the money and time they spend on a college degree is going to help them get a job in the future if AI is in the mix.
“And we really need to think about this fast, because if we need to retrain people who are laid off because of AI, we need to get those programs thought out and then implemented very quickly,” said Walden.
Leah Burton, SAS Institute (Photo: The Hunt Institute webinar)
The private sector is also closely watching how AI defines the employment outlook. Leah Burton works as a principal industry consultant for higher education at SAS Institute. Burton said the Cary-based company is working with states to integrate education and workforce data to project the job needs of the future. Continually reviewing that data and not letting it sit on a shelf will help states better understand if their education pipeline is meeting industry demand.
“As these changes in the workplace happen, we need to find ways to evaluate, analyze, and make important decisions so that while some jobs are going to become obsolete, workers themselves don’t become obsolete,” said Burton.
For those worried AI may one day eliminate their job, Northover offered some sobering advice.
“Certain jobs are getting phased out,” she said. “But I think that’s an opportunity for us to look at how we’re doing things and how we can use AI to help us do it better. It’s freeing up capacity, brain power, whatever you want to call it, to be able to think and perform on a higher level. Lifelong learning is critical in maintaining relevance.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-1359385182-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-08 06:12:54.792966

(Photo by Ronaldo Bolaños/The Texas Tribune)McALLEN, Texas — The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is beefing up its border security efforts along the Rio Grande, expanding on a controversial Texas strategy by placing large, floating buoys along more than 500 miles of the river.
U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced the deployment of the barriers Wednesday during a visit to the Rio Grande Valley that included a roundtable discussion with U.S. Customs and Border Protection personnel as well as ranchers whose property is often traversed by migrants moving north after crossing the border.
Standing before one of the buoys — large floating, cylindrical devices that can measure up to 15 feet long and four to five feet in diameter — Noem said 130 miles of the water barrier were already under contract and were beginning to be installed that day.
This water barrier is part of a push by President Donald Trump to build a “Smart Wall” made up of steel barriers, waterborne barriers, patrol roads, lights, cameras and detection technology. The projects are funded by the 2025 tax and spending megabill, which Trump named the One Big Beautiful Bill.
Noem touted the water barrier as a deterrent to people crossing the border illegally as well as drug smugglers and human traffickers.

Homeland Security and the Border Patrol are working with the U.S. International Boundary and Water Commission and the state of Texas to ensure proper installation of the buoys, Noem said.
The state of Texas is already familiar with using buoys to deter border crossings. Gov. Greg Abbott ordered the installation of a 1,000-foot water barrier along the Rio Grande near Eagle Pass in 2023 as part of his mission to tighten border security, and an additional 1,000 feet of buoys after Trump took office in January 2025.
“Texas finally has a partner in the White House,” Andrew Mahaleris, press secretary for Abbott, said in a statement Wednesday. “The floating marine barriers deployed by Texas have been a resounding success, and Governor Abbott is proud to work with the Trump Administration and Border Patrol to expand the program. ”
The buoys sparked protests from activists concerned about migrant safety and a complaint from the Mexican government alleging the buoys violated water treaties between the U.S. and Mexico. The U.S. Department of Justice under President Joe Biden sued Texas over the buoys, citing similar concerns. The U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has allowed the buoys to remain in place while the merits of the case move forward in a lower court. The state has argued it has the right to defend itself against an “invasion” of drug cartels.
Weeks after the buoy wall was installed in Eagle Pass, Mexican authorities reported a migrant had been found dead, caught on one of the floating spheres. On Wednesday, Noem argued that the water barrier would prevent migrant deaths by discouraging them from trying to cross the river.
“They’ll create a safer environment for agents on patrol, and securing our waterways not only protects Americans, it saves the lives of illegal aliens by deterring them from daring to attempt to cross through this treacherous water,” Noem said.

(Photo courtesy of the Idaho Supreme Court)The Gem State lost an accomplished public figure this year with the Nov. 7 death of Wayne Kidwell at age 87. He was born in Council, Idaho, on June 15, 1938, and raised in Boise, where he supported himself during his last high school years. He spent many years faithfully serving the public in local, state and federal offices.
Kidwell graduated from Boise High School in 1956, obtained a B.A. degree from the University of Idaho in 1960 and a law degree from the U of I in 1964. He interrupted his studies twice – first, to serve a year in the U.S. Marine Corps and, again, to serve two years as an officer in the U.S. Army Military Police Corps, including a tour on the DMZ in Korea. He attained the rank of captain.
Kidwell’s first elective office was as Ada County prosecutor. He then went on to be the second Idahoan elected to the top level of all three branches of state government. In 1968, he was elected to the state Senate, where his Republican colleagues chose him as majority leader. He was elected as Idaho attorney general in 1974, defeating the incumbent, Tony Park. In 1998, he was elected to the Idaho Supreme Court, retiring in January of 2005. He ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 1972 and 1980. He was expected to run for governor in 1978 but decided instead to spend time with family.
In 1980, Kidwell was appointed as the first attorney general of the Republic of the Marshall Islands. Two years later he was appointed associate deputy attorney general for the Reagan administration’s Department of Justice. His responsibilities included the department’s liaison with the White House. 
Kidwell’s tenure as Idaho’s attorney general was remarkable. He hired attorneys based on their qualifications, rather than political affiliation. He hired an excellent consumer protection chief, even after the candidate volunteered he’d voted for Kidwell’s opponent. He had courage, as evidenced by his fertilizer anti-trust lawsuit against the J.R. Simplot Company in 1975. When I was introduced to Jack Simplot in 1983 as Idaho’s new attorney general, he said, “I hope you don’t file a lawsuit against me like that knothead Kidwell.”
In a 1976 argument to the U.S. Supreme Court, Kidwell convinced the justices that Idaho should be allowed to sue Oregon and Washington for endangering salmon and steelhead by overfishing the runs. Both of his AG successors carried on with that lawsuit. In addition to providing competent legal advice and representation to the state, Kidwell steadfastly championed consumer protection, victims’ rights and scrupulous observance of the law, both by the public and by governmental entities at all levels.
I became acquainted with Wayne in 1974, when he attended a meeting of the Jerome County Republican Central Committee to gain support for his attorney general campaign. I was a member of the committee, but I had already committed to support his primary election opponent, Tim Hopkins of Idaho Falls. That may have gotten us off to a bad start. 
During his two campaigns for a position on the Supreme Court in the 1990s, I supported his opponent both times. He lost his 1994 race but won in 1998. It just so happened that I ran for the court in 2004 and took the position he was vacating. During the transition, we finally got to know each other and became good friends. 
We met for lunch frequently, and he soon invited me to join him and a former Ada County District Judge, Duff Mckee, for a weekly luncheon meeting at Eddie’s Restaurant on Overland Road in Boise. Our trio was dedicated to discussing and solving the problems of the state and nation. 
I learned that Wayne was vitally interested in the world around him. He studied the cosmos, ancient civilizations, scientific theories and natural phenomena. He was an armchair expert on coffee with at least three high quality espresso machines so as to make the very best brew. 
About four years ago, we invited Wayne’s 1974 opponent for the AG’s job, Tony Park, to make it a lunch foursome. The foursome got along famously, viewing most social and political issues in the same light. It’s interesting how the passage of time can wisen your views and break down barriers. Unfortunately, our group lost both Tony and Wayne in 2025. May they rest in peace.

(Andrew Fraieli/Colorado Newsline)A Colorado organization is leading two ballot measures that would restrict rights for transgender children in the state. 
Protect Kids Colorado, a coalition led by prominent anti-LGBTQ activist Erin Lee, is gathering signatures for ballot measures that would prevent transgender children from participating in school sports and receiving gender-affirming surgeries. Lee led several anti-LGBTQ initiatives that the Colorado Title Board rejected ahead of the 2024 election. 
The group has until Feb. 20 to submit 124,238 valid signatures from registered voters for each initiative to the Colorado secretary of state’s office. If that threshold is met, the measures would be placed on the November 2026 ballot.

Z Williams, co-director of the Denver nonprofit Bread and Roses Legal Center, said both of the issues the ballot measures seek to address are relatively minute. Williams said they have yet to see “actual validated science” that supports the need for the initiatives. 
“The number of trans athletes is incredibly small, and the number of gender-affirming surgeries done for transgender youth or minors is even smaller,” Williams said. “We have two ballot measures … that are going to require hundreds of thousands of dollars, waste a lot of time, create a lot of confusion during the election over two pretty much manufactured issues.”
Protect Kids Colorado did not respond to Newsline’s request for comment on the initiatives.










Coloradans value freedom, a freedom that belongs to everyone, including transgender youth and their families.


– Cal Solverson, spokesperson for One Colorado


There isn’t clear data on the number of transgender student athletes in Colorado, and the two major hospitals that provide gender-affirming care to minors do not offer surgeries to minors.
Cal Solverson, spokesperson for LGBTQ+ advocacy organization One Colorado, said the ballot measures are ill-informed and jeopardize individual freedom. They also put transgender people, their families and health care providers across the state at risk, Solverson said. 
“Coloradans value freedom, a freedom that belongs to everyone, including transgender youth and their families,” Solverson said in a statement. “The right to exist as we are extends beyond the exam room to the playing field, where every child deserves the opportunity to stay active, develop life skills, and experience the deep camaraderie of a team.”
If the measures make it to the ballot, Solverson said One Colorado trusts that Colorado voters will defend transgender youth and “ensure that freedom continues to exist for all Coloradans and not just some.”
Prohibit certain surgeries on minors
Ballot Initiative 110 would prohibit health care professionals from knowingly performing any surgery on a minor “for the purpose of altering biological sex characteristics.” 
The measure would also prohibit state and federal funding including Medicaid from being used to pay for gender-affirming procedures.  
Children’s Hospital Colorado and Denver Health have paused gender-affirming care for youth amid the Trump administration’s threats to pull Medicaid and Medicare funding entirely.   
A document on Protect Kids Colorado’s website says that Children’s Hospital Colorado performs gender-affirming surgeries on minors, but Children’s Hospital said in a statement that it has never provided gender-affirming surgical care to patients under 18, and it stopped offering such surgeries to adults in 2023. Denver Health stopped offering surgeries to minors in early 2025.
The document also says that while the ballot measure only targets gender-affirming surgeries, the organizations has “a multi-pronged plan to outlaw puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones for minors as well.”
The language in the initiative includes medical terms that aren’t necessarily related to surgery, such as prescriptions. It also applies to health care professionals such as podiatrists, dentists and chiropractors, who wouldn’t be performing gender-affirming surgeries in the first place. That adds concern about how the measure would affect other elements of gender-affirming care, according to Mardi Moore, CEO of LGBTQ+ advocacy group Rocky Mountain Equality. 
“It’s kind of like they’re throwing the spaghetti at the wall to see what’s going to stick,” Moore said. “There’s not a lot of people you can trust anymore, and I think Protect Kids Colorado is one of those groups that cannot be trusted to think they will keep all children safe.”
If the measure passes, it would lead to discriminatory practices in medical care, affecting all children, not just transgender children, Moore said. 
Male and female participation in school sports
Ballot Initiative 109 would create definitions in state statute aiming to define boys and girls based on physical anatomy, excluding transgender people. 
Sports teams sponsored by schools or athletic associations would be required to expressly designate those teams as for men, women or co-ed. Schools and their athletic departments would be required to adopt policies implementing the requirements of the initiative.
The measure would not affect any student’s ability to participate in co-ed sports. 
The state’s commissioner of education would be tasked with enforcing the measure, and would have discretion to determine how to “take appropriate remedial action” against any school not in compliance with its requirements. 
“It would mean a little 8-year-old who loves to play soccer and who happens to be trans couldn’t play anymore,” Moore said of Initiative 109. 
Colorado is known to be a safe place for LGBTQ+ people, Williams said, and families have moved to the state from around the country because they share those values. 
“When I was a kid, we were ‘the hate state,’ and Colorado has unequivocally disavowed that stance,” Williams said. “So I think we need to remember that these are folks that are trying to use a very marginalized community to rebuild a political ideology that’s been rejected for a very long time here.” 
Protect Kids Colorado is running a third ballot measure to increase penalties for people convicted of human trafficking of a minor.

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana’s Senate Republicans released a slim priority agenda Wednesday — targeting waste, fraud and abuse in Indiana’s food and health care benefit programs.
Senate Bill 1, authored by Sen. Chris Garten, R-Charlestown, focuses on ensuring that only U.S. citizens receive aid.
“Americans are outraged by the billions of dollars of welfare fraud in our nation — and the Minnesota scandal is Exhibit A,” a news release said. The bill is “Indiana’s latest effort to catch bad actors to preserve programs like SNAP and Medicaid for Hoosiers who need them most.”
Only one other bill was highlighted: Senate Joint Resolution 1, authored by Sen. Eric Koch, R-Bedford.
The resolution is the second prong of a three-part process to amend the Indiana Constitution. The founding document makes nearly everyone eligible for bail, but the proposal would allow judges to deny bail to anyone they deem a “substantial risk.”
The measure has already passed one Legislature and now must pass in 2026 to be added to the November ballot for a public vote.
The third priority noted was to continue prioritizing fiscal discipline “in the face of increased pressure from Democrats to prematurely spend taxpayer money” and by ending the 2026 legislative session “ahead of time and under budget.”

The legislative session is scheduled to run through the end of February.
The bulk of the Senate Republican agenda is tightening regulations for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and Medicaid. Garten said about half the bill is simply conforming to recent federal changes in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.
Garten’s legislation would increase eligibility checks for SNAP, prevent illegal immigrants from claiming benefits and update Indiana’s laws to comply with federal Medicaid reforms, including work requirements for able-bodied, working-age adults.
“The days of asking hardworking Hoosiers to subsidize lawlessness are over,” Garten said. “Our public safety net exists to support our most vulnerable citizens — not those who have broken our laws to enter the country. If you are here illegally, you are disqualified from receiving Hoosier tax dollars, and we will report you to federal authorities. It is that simple.”
The news releases offered no examples of fraud or waste in the systems.
Garten told the Indiana Capital Chronicle he doesn’t know the number of noncitizens receiving benefits.
“That’s part of the problem,” he said.
Senate Bill 1 would mandate verification of immigration status for all Medicaid and SNAP applicants. And it goes further: any applicant who cannot verify legal presence would be immediately referred to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for investigation and potential deportation proceedings.
Last year, Indiana lawmakers added work requirements for able-bodied Hoosiers on Indiana’s Healthy Indiana Plan. Months later, the federal government did the same; Garten’s bill will match the federal requirements and go into effect in 2027. Additionally, HIP enrollment will now be every six months instead of annually.
The state would also adopt the federal definition of medically frail. The language specifically says the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration can’t expand the definition administratively.
“That’s a limit switch for us as a Legislature. We don’t want the agency to expand Medicaid rolls,” Garten said. “It’s our fiscal lever.”

The swing district is set to be among the most high profile congressional races in the 2026 midterm elections as Democrats try for a third time to unseat incumbent Republican Rep. Derrick Van Orden. President Donald Trump won the district in 2024 with 53% of the vote. 
Since Trump’s inauguration, Van Orden has positioned himself as a vocal supporter of the president, often appearing at White House events and loudly defending Trump on social media. 
That defense extended to the Venezuelan raid, of which Van Orden, a former U.S. Navy SEAL, described on X as “perfect.”
“I would like to commend @realDonaldTrump, @SecWar, and the members of our glorious military that conducted the raid in Venezuela to capture the narcoterrorist Maduro,” Van Orden wrote on X shortly after the news of the action was announced. “Perfect operational security and execution.”
Despite regularly criticising American “forever wars,” Van Orden has praised the Venezuela attack as part of an effort to prevent the flow of drugs into the U.S. 
“This operation sends a clear message to America’s adversaries: harming U.S. citizens carries consequences,” Van Orden said in a statement. Nicolás Maduro operated as a narco-terrorist under the false cover of political authority. His criminal network helped fuel the drug trafficking that has killed thousands of Americans. He is now detained and no longer in a position to threaten American lives. President Trump’s decisive leadership made this possible. His administration has made it clear that America will no longer tolerate narco-terrorists who profit from the deaths of our citizens.”
While Van Orden’s defense of the president is expected, two of the Democrats running in the primary to succeed him have diverged on the issue. 
Rebecca Cooke, who ran against Van Orden in 2024 and is widely seen as the frontrunner, criticized the lack of a long term plan in Venezuela and the break from Trump’s campaign promise to stay out of foreign wars, but celebrated the unseating of Maduro despite the lack of congressional involvement in the decision to approve military action on a foreign country. 
“Donald Trump and I don’t agree on much, but one thing we used to agree on is ending American involvement in endless foreign wars,” Cooke said in a statement. “I applaud the excellent work of the CIA and Delta teams in capturing a ruthless dictator in Nicolas Maduro — but where is the concrete plan for stability in the region? We haven’t seen one yet. Without it, our nation involves itself in another foreign conflict. I am disappointed — as I’m sure many Wisconsinites are disappointed — to see this administration betray a central promise when communities across Western Wisconsin are struggling.”
Cooke also said she thinks the president should be more focused on domestic issues.
Emily Berge, the president of the Eau Claire City Council who is running against Cooke in the Democratic primary, criticized the military action without any laudatory comments about deposing Maduro. 
“Derrick Van Orden and Donald Trump promised to be ‘America First’ and to end the longstanding waste of our tax dollars bombing other countries based on fabricated stories all in the pursuit of foreign oil,” Berge said in a statement. “They are both breaking their promises to the American people.”
Across the country, criticism of the attack has focused on the president’s decision to go into Venezuela without approval from Congress — which under the U.S. Constitution retains the authority to approve the use of military force. 
On X, Van Orden supported the lack of congressional notification before the operation, agreeing with a post that stated telling Congress would have resulted in details being leaked to the press. 
However, U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin has co-sponsored legislation prohibiting the use of military force in Venezuela without authorization by Congress. 
“President Trump stormed into Venezuela and is drawing the U.S. into another forever war just to take Venezuela’s oil and enrich his big oil buddies,” Baldwin said in a statement. “Simply put, this is not what Wisconsin families signed up for. This puts all the men and women who don the uniform at risk, reeks of corruption, and just shows the President is focused on everything except lowering costs and the issues that keep Wisconsin families up at night. The President cannot just start wars at a whim; he needs to get the people’s approval – and that means Congress signing off.”

(Photo: Karen Pulfer Focht for the Tennessee Lookout)As we enter 2026, the United States is not simply polarized. We are disoriented. 
There is a widening crisis of faith in democracy, governance, the economy and religion. 
Institutions once trusted to anchor public life now feel distant, compromised or hollow. For many, especially in Black communities, the question is no longer whether the system is broken, but whether it still belongs to us at all.
This crisis is not merely emotional. It is structural. And it is deeply tied to the weakening relationship between our electoral process and the institutions historically responsible for shaping moral clarity, political literacy and prophetic imagination. For Black communities, those institutions have been consistent and indispensable: Black churches and Black educational institutions, particularly historically Black colleges and universities.
When these institutions are underfunded, marginalized, or reduced to symbolic relevance, democratic participation erodes. Civic education thins. Political engagement becomes reactive instead of intentional. Moral formation gives way to confusion, cynicism, and despair.
Nowhere will this reality matter more in 2026 than in Memphis and Shelby County.
Locally, we are navigating a public safety conundrum shaped by contradiction. Crime has declined and did so before the creation of the Memphis Safe Task Force in September. That fact deserves honesty. 
But it is not the full truth. Many residents still do not feel safe. Violence remains too present in too many neighborhoods. For law abiding Black and Hispanic Memphians — the majority in Memphis — law enforcement strategies often feel more like profiling than protection.
The contradiction has produced a fractured narrative. Local and federal entities point to data and demand celebration. Many Black Memphians point to lived experience and demand accountability. When our political and civic leaders refuse to hold both truths at once, trust erodes. Public safety becomes a political talking point rather than a shared moral responsibility.



				When these institutions are underfunded, marginalized, or reduced to symbolic relevance, democratic participation erodes. Civic education thins. Moral formation gives way to confusion, cynicism, and despair.			


This tension will be magnified by the electoral calendar. In 2026, Shelby County voters will face three elections: a county primary in May, a combined county general and state and federal primary in August and national midterm elections in November. These elections will test more than turnout. They will test whether people still believe democracy belongs to them.
If democracy is to mean anything tangible this year, we must be willing to name clear goals. One such goal should be a minimum 20 percent increase in voter turnout in each election compared to the previous cycle. Not as a symbolic aspiration, but as a measurable indicator of whether our institutions are educating, mobilizing and empowering the public.
That level of participation does not happen accidentally. It must be cultivated. Historically, Black churches and HBCUs have done this work by pairing civic education with theological grounding and political discernment.
In Memphis, that work is already happening, often without sufficient support. At Abyssinian Baptist Church, civic engagement is treated as a moral and theological obligation, not a seasonal activity. Through initiatives like UPTheVote901 — a civic organization designed to boost voter turnout, and one in which I am involved — we work to educate and mobilize voters while protecting their dignity without partisan alignment.
At LeMoyne-Owen College, an HBCU founded to educate and empower formerly enslaved people, civic formation remains central to its mission of producing critically conscious graduates equipped to serve and lead.
But voter participation alone is not enough.
Renewal of democratic values in Shelby County requires full funding of Black institutions
The second goal for 2026 must be the full and sustained funding of Black institutions, not merely Black-led organizations. There is a difference. Too often, white-controlled institutions place Black leadership at the forefront while maintaining extractive power structures behind the scenes. That is not empowerment. It is cover.
If Memphis and Shelby County are serious about democratic renewal, Black institutions accountable to Black communities must be resourced to operate with independence, integrity, and longevity. This includes churches, HBCUs, and grassroots civic organizations committed to long-term formation rather than short-term political gain.
This work must also be grounded in an expanded Memphis People’s Agenda, which was developed from more than 2,000 community surveys identifying core concerns around the City budget, labor and wages, housing and the environment, education, and public safety. The Agenda should function not as a static document, but as a living framework that aligns policy priorities with the lived realities of working people, young people, and those most impacted by violence, disinvestment, and political neglect.
This is not a call for partisan loyalty. It is a call for institutional integrity.
Black churches must reclaim their prophetic voice without becoming campaign machines. HBCUs must deepen civic engagement without fear of political retaliation. And the public must recognize that prophetic institutions require more than praise. They require participation, trust, and financial investment.
2026 is a make-or-break year for Memphis and Shelby County. Not because of any single election or task force, but because of what this moment demands collectively. Democracy is not self-sustaining. Freedom requires formation.
The future is not guaranteed. But it is still up for grabs.

It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
Keith Carter had a premium vantage point at the Sugar Bowl for arguably the biggest moment in Mississippi’s college football history, standing directly behind the goalposts as Lucas Carneiro’s 47-yard field goal split the uprights.
The Ole Miss athletic director scooped up the football and tucked it under both arms, hugging it tight like a fullback as he ran through the end zone in jubilation.
The 49-year-old Carter — who played basketball for the Rebels in the late 1990s — didn’t play a snap in Ole Miss’ 39-34 victory over Georgia in the College Football Playoff quarterfinals. But in some ways, he might be the most important person for a football program that hasn’t acheived this much success since the early 1960s.
He is also the man working to keep Ole Miss on top.
“We want to go win the whole thing this year, obviously,” Carter said. “But our hope is to be right back here next year and be a program that’s an every-year CFP contender with a chance to win national championships.”
Keith Carter, the University of Mississippi athletics director
Such talk would have sounded crazy less than a decade ago when Ole Miss was mostly an afterthought in the SEC, dealing with the fallout of an NCAA investigation into rules violations and a messy breakup with then-coach Hugh Freeze.
But as the No. 6 seed Rebels prepare to face No. 10 Miami in the Fiesta Bowl on Thursday with a spot in the national championship game on the line, it doesn’t feel nearly as far-fetched.
Thanks to a group of behind-the-scenes people that includes Carter and Walker Jones — who leads the Ole Miss NIL collective — the Rebels have thrived in the pay-for-play era, building a fundraising behemoth that’s given them resources to build a roster that includes quarterback Trinidad Chambliss, running back Kewan Lacy and a defense stacked with NFL-caliber talent.
Chambliss recently committed to return to the Rebels next season pending NCAA approval. He said Ole Miss has all of the resources it needs to compete at the highest level.
Mississippi quarterback Trinidad Chambliss holds the “Golden Egg” trophy his team won in their victory over Mississippi State at their annual NCAA college football game, Friday, Nov. 28, 2025, in Starkville, Miss. Credit: AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis
“I feel like college football’s changed throughout the years,” Chambliss said. “NIL changed that. The transfer portal changed that. The college football playoff changed that. I feel like Ole Miss, being in the SEC, the best conference in the nation, you’re going to get guys. You’re going to get good guys and coaches want to coach there. Ole Miss has done a good job transitioning with how college football is transitioning itself.”
Jones played football for the Rebels in the 1990s before a business career that included more than a decade with Under Armour. He came back to Ole Miss in 2022 to lead The Grove Collective, which is the athletic department’s fundraising arm.
Carter and Jones have known each other since their days playing Ole Miss sports and that connection was crucial.
“I always talk about the trust Keith had in me to come back in this capacity during a very confusing and complex time,” Jones said. “That probably wasn’t easy. I credit our history together and the experience of being student-athletes together.”
The Rebels were quick to adapt to the NIL era under coach Lane Kiffin, who iprovided the recruiting. Carter and Jones provided the money and a juggernaut was born.
Now Kiffin is gone — headed to LSU after an awkward breakup — but the money remains. Jones has cultivated a group of roughly 7,000 donors in The Grove Collective who range from millionaries to college students. It’s all impressive for a school that has a large following, but not the same kind of massive alumni base of schools like Ohio State or Texas.
“We may not have a T. Boone Pickens or a Phil Knight,” Carter said, referring to the well-heeled donors for Oklahoma State and Oregon. “But when you put us all together collectively, pull the rope in the same direction and people give not only what they can, but maybe even a little above what they should, we’ve been able to be really good.”
Ole Miss’ staying power has been evident over the past 12 months after last year’s disappointing ending to the season. The Rebels spent a boatload of money in 2024 for a roster that included quarterback Jaxson Dart, but they went 9-3 in the regular season and didn’t make the playoff.
Jones and Carter weren’t deterred and the donations kept pouring into the program. One year later, they’re exactly where they want to be. Even losing Kiffin hasn’t stopped the momentum; Carter quickly promoted Pete Golding and the Rebels keep chugging along.
“You’ve seen this before in sports,” Carter said. “There’s a team with all the expectations and you fall a little short. Then the very next year, you look up, and there’s a team that’s maybe not as heralded or doesn’t have as much preseason hype. But the pieces fit perfectly, the locker room is right, all these intangible things happen and it’s the best team in school history.”
It’s all new territory for an Ole Miss program that hasn’t been a powerhouse since the 1950s and ’60s, back before integration. The Rebels claim three national championships in football, though none since 1962.

There were a few good moments in the ensuing decades: Eli Manning was the team’s quarterback during a few heady years in the early 2000s, the Rebels won the Cotton Bowl in 2008 and Freeze had it rolling for a few years in the mid-2010s before NCAA troubles arose.
All those flashes of national relavance faded quickly.
Now because of Carter, Jones and a whole lot of cash, this version of Ole Miss might stick around for a while. Carter is soaking in the moment.
“It’s not just for me,” Carter said. “I’m the one who gets recognized and is the one out in front, but there are so many people who deserve this. I’m so happy for our fans, the ones who have been through some ups and downs.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/01232241/AP26002189253468.jpg,,,2026-01-08 06:12:54.792966

No chair. Even though your job could be done sitting. Sounds bad, right? Now imagine you’re sick. Sore back. Aching foot. Elderly. Same rules apply.

(Photo by Luis Alvarez/Getty Images)Imagine working somewhere that forces you to stand. No chair. Even though your job could be done sitting. Sounds bad, right? Now imagine you’re sick. Sore back. Aching foot. Elderly. Same rules apply. For tens of thousands of West Virginians, this is a daily reality. The topic is normalized. Ignored. Forgotten — except by those experiencing it. 
Here’s the deal: Clerks, cashiers and service workers should be allowed a chair or stool. It’s a real issue. And has nothing to do with efficiency. America confuses hardship with productivity. We embrace a culture of austerity that treats worker suffering as acceptable. 
Many folks stand for entire shifts. In one place. On unforgiving floors. The work does not require it. The rule does. And it prevents many from working. Those who are able just shoulder the pain. Before a body part gives out. Chairs would improve workforce participation, health and fairness. 
The other day I was using the self checkout at Walmart. A young worker stood monitoring a screen. I asked how her feet were holding up. She confided she was born with a spinal condition. Standing hurt. I asked if she was permitted to sit. She said she was allowed only if she was injured. Confused, I asked if she had asked her supervisor. She hadn’t. Feared being reprimanded. Or told no. She also added that she had no medical documentation.
Europeans do it differently. This issue first crossed my consciousness living in the Netherlands as a West Virginia Rotary Scholar. When I went to the store, cashiers had elevated stools. All of them. At register height. I’ve never seen an American cashier ringing up a product while seated in my life. 
In the Netherlands, seats are provided by law. A human right. And guess what? Work gets done. Lines move. No drama. And another note: Dutch cashiers are younger on average than West Virginia workers. It’s considered a job for youth there. 
Retail and service jobs are some of the most common employment options in West Virginia.  Walmart employees thousands. It has historically been our single largest private employer. For America, also. 
West Virginians are not so healthy. Standing in one place for hours makes it worse. Stresses aching bodies. According to West Virginia Public Broadcasting, in 2025, West Virginia remained the most overweight state in the country. Over 40%. And more than 15% report a disability that limits daily activities. Providing chairs is a low-cost intervention that prevents fatigue, pain and absenteeism. 
Here’s another kicker: To add insult to injury, service jobs often have lower wages. This can add extra stress. Many cannot afford a car. They rely on buses, rides from others or long walks. People are exhausted before they even get to work.
I’m a long-distance runner. I put my feet through pain by choice. One night of standing — one time as a restaurant hostess — left my feet aching. Standing in place felt more painful than running a race. 
And another point: A no-sitting rule does not impact all equally. It disproportionately harms older workers. Pregnant or disabled workers may not even apply. A stool costs pennies compared to turnover and workplace injury. This is not radical. It is common sense. Sitting does not harm business. It protects people. Europe figured this out decades ago. A simple truth: bodies matter. 
West Virginia should pass a law on this. It’s stupid not to. We can do better. Bottom line? The option to sit is not a perk. It’s a health necessity. Common sense. Safety, productivity and fairness demand it. The next time a politician talks about improving worker participation they should bring up stools. West Virginia bodies are not disposable.

(Photo courtesy of History Colorado)In 1876, Coloradans could travel by train between Denver and Boulder or Greeley or Colorado Springs. But this convenience, since lost, belied the Colorado Territory’s infancy.
The Eastern Plains were mostly empty. The Western Slope, where recent treaty terms reserved much of the region for the Ute people, was as yet bereft of such communities as Grand Junction, Glenwood Springs and Aspen. Just 250 people resided in the hamlet of Breckenridge.
Denver, where roughly 20,000 lived — about the same number of residents in Durango today — boasted one saloon for about every 400 people. Its commercial sector also included three gun shops, three music shops, nine banks and nine newspapers.
These and other revealing facts are reported by Chase Woodruff in a story published Jan. 1 to launch a special Newsline project. Called Colorado at 150, the project marks Colorado’s sesquicentennial — 150 years of Colorado statehood. Colorado entered the union as the Centennial State on Aug. 1, 1876, under President Ulysses S. Grant.

The project comprises several parts. One features stories like Woodruff’s and will offer a window on what life was like in Colorado 150 years ago. Called “Timeline 1876,”  this part will also note important events from that year. To do this, we’ll draw on historic newspapers and other archival resources, including those maintained by History Colorado.
Another part will explore the people and events that helped define Colorado, good and bad, over 150 years of statehood. Think of the Ludlow Massacre in 1914, the establishment of Rocky Mountain National Park in 1915, the last detainees leaving the Camp Amache Japanese incarceration site in 1945, Boulder County Clerk Clela Rorex issuing the nation’s first same-sex marriage license in 1975, John Elway leading the Denver Broncos to a Super Bowl victory in 1998. These and other consequential moments form the soul of Colorado.
We’ll also highlight sesquicentennial events that are planned throughout the year, such as “38th Star: Colorado Becomes the Centennial State,” an exhibit at the History Colorado Center in Denver that will run through Sept. 6. As Woodruff has reported, the America 250-Colorado 150 commission, established in Colorado law, has approved 12 “signature initiatives” related to the sesquicentennial. These include a documentary film series, a new historic marker program, a “digital passport” program to encourage Colorado tourism, and an oral history project. At least two events are planned for the Aug. 1 anniversary, including the Mile High 150 Expo at the Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport in Broomfield.
The celebration of 150 years of Colorado coincides with the celebration of 250 years of the United States of America — a milestone with its own awkward name, semiquincentennial. We have a special interest in Colorado, but we’ll also cover events in the state related to the country’s anniversary.
It’s a fraught time to ruminate on the country’s history. Many people in Colorado and beyond are aghast at the lawless behavior of a federal administration that so often disregards the founding laws and principles of the United States, and they wonder how much of the American promise is left to celebrate. Historian Jill Lepore, in the New Yorker, recently described the mood in ominous terms: “In a year that has already seen multiple political assassinations, the deployment of the National Guard to American cities, and masked agents of the federal government hauling people off the streets and into unmarked vans, the prospects for a peaceful anniversary appear remote.”
But a thorough and honest exploration of how we got here could only help the state and the country chart where to go. Colorado at 150 will highlight moments in the state’s history that are sure to inspire pride. It will also recall painful episodes. But an unflinching view aligns with the rest of our journalism, which assumes that truth is always the basis for an informed community that can act with clarity and confidence for its own interests.
We’re also interested in your perspective. Many Coloradans have a connection to people, events and communities that helped shape the state’s history. If that describes you, let us know. We want to hear your story.

(Courtesy of Dominion)The Virginia Clean Economy Act pushes the commonwealth towards a complete renewable energy portfolio in a few short decades. One challenge the law’s opponents often cite is that solar energy is not as easily dispatchable as gas power. 
With battery storage technology becoming more mainstream, VCEA proponents are aiming to ramp up the state’s investment in them and proposing bills to that effect to be debated in the 2026 legislative session, starting next week.
Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax, one of the original sponsors of the VCEA, announced Wednesday he’s bringing back his bill to revise the law to increase the amount of battery storage Virginia’s major utility companies will need to invest in by certain benchmark years laid out in the law. A dual bill will be filed in the Senate by Sen. Lamont Bagby, D-Richmond.
“In order to meet the challenges our commonwealth faces, we must do more. More than last year’s bill required. Virginia should be leading, not trailing,” said Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax.
Under the current law, Dominion Energy is required to petition the State Corporation Commission for 2,700 MW of battery storage by 2036, and Appalachian Power Company is required to petition for 400 MW. Sullivan said that the bill he is bringing this year will “significantly” increase that amount. At the time of the press conference on the bill on Wednesday, the final numbers had not been published.
The goal of the increase is to bring down costs through generating power during the cheaper times of day and dispatch the stored power when it is most needed. The bill will also have requirements for amounts of short-range storage and long-range storage batteries, which is usually separated by above and below six to eight hours of storage.
The cost to build the batteries, like any energy infrastructure, will be added to customer bills through riders. Sullivan stressed that the cost of these batteries is much less than the cost to build fossil fuel plants or even small nuclear reactors. He also pointed out that the batteries could be placed on the grid much faster than the alternatives.
“The numbers are clear,” Sullivan said. “… the levelized cost of storage is way below any other form of generation of power. So we will have to spend money on better storage? Yes. It will save us from spending more money on other forms of generation.”
The bill also directs the SCC to evaluate the projects to ensure the most cost effective methods as well as adjust safety measures to align with national standards.
Conservatives have bristled at the idea of mandating additional storage as the technology is still fairly new and expensive, while Democrats emphasized that costs have been reduced in recent years. 
Del. Terry Kilgore, R-Scott, said he supports more gas power plants as they are able to produce more megawatts than an average solar and storage project.
“I am for all of the above,” Kilgore said, echoing outgoing Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s energy generation plan for the state. “But we have to be realistic about the fact that in the commonwealth there is not enough solar capacity there to meet our needs over the next two to five years and that is what we need to be more concerned about.”
Dominion recently petitioned the SCC for its largest investment in solar and battery storage projects to date – with 11 projects totaling over $2.9 billion. Appalachian Power has had some challenges with storage facilities after they canceled one project in an outage-prone area due to hurricane damage.
Another bill that is being filed by Del. Phil Hernandez, D-Norfolk, directs the SCC to take stock of where existing transmission lines are not being fully utilized at power plants, such as gas peaker plants that don’t run at full capacity most of the year. Locations that are identified to have additional energy capacity space would allow for solar and battery storage to be placed at the power plants to put more renewable power on the grid.
“We can use the assets that we have, like the transmission system, much more efficiently. So we take advantage of what we’ve already spent as a society and we use it better (through) batteries,” said John Zahurancik with Fluence, an Arlington based battery storage company.
Each of the bills will be debated during the regular legislative session that begins on Jan. 14.

(Photo by Ben Cunningham/Allegheny-Blue Ridge Alliance)A controversial transfer of a trail project to Virginia’s passenger rail authority was pushed through by Transportation Secretary Shep Miller on Tuesday after a vote by the Commonwealth Transportation Board resulted in a 6-6 tie, drawing scrutiny of the board’s process and the project’s future. 
After the board’s vote of support, the project was transferred to the Virginia Passenger Rail Authority, which will oversee $35 million in grant funding for preservation and improvements by the Shenandoah Valley Battlefield Foundation.
Events leading up to the vote drew mixed reactions from lawmakers and the public. Many questioned the cost, transparency, and feasibility of a rail-with-trail versus a trail-only project for the dilapidated, 50-mile Shenandoah rail corridor, which has been inactive for 36 years.
After the board failed to reach consensus to delay the vote, the agency’s recommended plan moved forward. 
“At the end of the day, I stand by what I recommended to you, what the governor and administration recommend to you, because we think that’s in the best interest of the citizens of the commonwealth,” Miller said on Tuesday.
He said that further delay could jeopardize the project, including the planned merger between Norfolk Southern Corporation, which owns the rail line, and Union Pacific Corporation. Miller added that public input remains part of the plan.
Under the terms of the transfer, the Shenandoah Valley Battlefield Foundation would buy the rail line from Norfolk Southern. The remaining funds would be used to build the trail and meet state lawmakers’ criteria.
The agreement tasks the foundation with building the trail by certain deadlines, and gives it the authority to preserve the rail corridor for future passenger use, clarifying operational roles and risk responsibility.
For some, the vote was disappointing, as they hoped to boost the region’s economy and promote healthier lifestyles with a multi-use trail; others see more potential in restoring the Manassas Gap rail line and building a parallel trail.
During the meeting, about 17 speakers addressed the board. Some called for swift action, while others raised concerns specifically about the foundation, which is facing legal disputes over its authority to be involved in the project.
The foundation told the Mercury it will return to court in the spring to prove it did not exceed its authority in joining the rail trail project. 
VDOT projections indicate a recreational trail would cost $164 million, while restoring the rail line with an adjacent trail would cost $687 million, directly influencing project feasibility and choice. 
Rail supporters say those estimates are too high.
Before Miller’s decision, board member Laura Sellers had moved to delay board action until public input sessions were complete. This followed reports from board members and lawmakers that scheduled public hearings on the third and final assessment report did not occur.
“…the motion to delay and table is not to make a stand for one way or the other, is to provide time to ask these questions, to go through the study… and to allow the public comment period to take place,” Sellers said. “It’s not to choose one side or the other. It’s simply to give us more time.”
Board member Raymond Smoot Jr. supported the rail-with-trail plan and said it addresses those concerns by ensuring public input and requiring evaluation of proposals from interested groups.
“I believe that the project (can) be handled in such a way that will preserve the corridor for possible future rail use — that could be at a time that is probably unknowable today — but it would preserve that option going forward,” Smoot said. “I personally would hope that all of the groups that are interested in this project would come together and unite behind a proposal that may involve various groups, but one that will assure that this is developed as provided in the resolution.”
VPRA will be responsible for scheduling public meetings, according to the board’s resolution. No dates have been scheduled as of Wednesday morning. The agency will also be responsible for considering and evaluating any proposals submitted by “established organizations” by Feb. 15.
Proposals must include a trail alongside the rail while preserving the corridor/rail for potential future use. VPRA said it does not expect a potential rail line to be immediately developed. 
CTB will vet and review the agreement and any subsequent proposals and contract terms before work begins

Senate Bill 56 
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine signed a bill into law last month that made various changes to the state’s voter-passed marijuana law, including adding crimes such as making it illegal to bring legally purchased marijuana from another state back to Ohio. 
DeWine signed Ohio Senate Bill 56, which is set to take effect in March. The bill also bans intoxicating hemp products. 
On the marijuana side, it will reduce the THC levels in adult-use marijuana extracts from a maximum of 90% down to a maximum of 70%, cap THC levels in adult-use flower to 35%, and prohibit smoking in most public places. 
The bill gets rid of protections against discrimination for housing, employment, and organ donation. It also allows police to have probable cause during traffic stops if someone is a known user of marijuana. 
The bill prohibits possessing marijuana in anything outside of its original packaging and criminalizes bringing legal marijuana from another state back to Ohio. It also requires drivers to store marijuana in the trunk of their car while driving. 
Ohioans for Cannabis Choice recently launched a referendum effort in an attempt to stop the law from taking effect.

(Photo by Steve Crane/Maryland Matters)In another move away from federal health agencies under President Donald Trump (R), the Moore administration wants to authorize the state’s health secretary to recommend vaccine schedules for Marylanders.
Health Secretary Meena Seshamani said legislation that would grant her that authority is a direct response to “the endless changes at the federal level around vaccine policy,” including recent changes from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention surrounding childhood vaccinations.
“Vaccines remain one of the most powerful public health tools that we have to keep ourselves, our families and our communities healthy and safe from disease,” she told reporters in a virtual briefing Wednesday. “Now more than ever, with the swirl of uncertainty at the federal level, evidence-based data will continue to be our North Star.”
Earlier this week, President Donald Trump (R) issued a memorandum tasking U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the CDC to reevaluate childhood vaccines based off of “best practices from peer, developed countries.”
The CDC then announced it was reducing the number of vaccinations recommended for all children.
Health advocates worry feds’ new COVID vaccine guidelines will mean fewer vaccinations

Now, vaccinations protecting children against rotavirus, influenza, COVID-19 and hepatitis A and B are recommended only for those with severe health complications, or after consultation with a health care provider, rather than being broadly recommended for all children, as they had been.
Since Trump took office for his second term, various agencies in his administration have bucked decades of vaccination recommendations supported by top medical organizations and a majority of scientific research. That has led to public confusion over vaccine safety and best practices, say advocates and Maryland Health Department officials.
“As a pediatrician, the most important thing for me,” MDH Deputy Secretary of Public Health Meg Sullivan said, “is that parents have all of the information they need and have all of their questions answered.
“I do think right now that parents out there are confused. We are really committed to trying to provide clear recommendations for parents at the state level,” she said.
In the 2025 session, the General Assembly passed House Bill 1315, which locked in vaccine recommendations that were issued under the Biden administration. That law ensures that health insurers operating in the state continued to cover vaccines as recommended from that year regardless of federal guidance under the next administration.
The new legislation, referred to as the Vax Act of 2026, would allow the Maryland health secretary to issue vaccine recommendations without being tied to a federal agency, though the secretary would be able to consider federal guidance when issuing recommendations.
“Where the statute currently is, it says that insurance providers have to cover vaccines as of what the Advisory Committee of Immunization Practices recommended on Dec. 31, 2024,” Seshamani said. “So it was frozen in time.
“What this legislation would do, it would enable there to be a more dynamic determination of what are the recommended vaccines that insurance providers have to cover,” she said.
The bill is stil being drafted, according to state officials.
The Moore administration has already taken steps to preserve vaccine recommendations from a pre-Trump era.
Maryland advocates hope new multistate public health coalition will clarify vaccine ‘confusion’

In addition to HB 1315, lawmakers also approved legislation that expanded authority for  pharmacists to administer vaccinations without a prescription. And in November, Gov. Wes Moore (D) announced a new program to help uninsured and underinsured individuals get access to vaccines at local health departments in certain counties.
Maryland also joined the Northeast Public Health Collaborative, a coalition of states opposing the Trump administration’s approach to vaccine recommendations, but issuing their own vaccine recommendations based on guidance from medical societies such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians.
The Vax Act would prompt the health secretary to turn to those organizations for vaccine recommendations, while considering the guidance of federal agencies and entities as “elective,” according to a press release on the proposed legislation.
“The federal government has traditionally been a place for trusted information. I think that in the current environment, states are stepping up,” Seshamani said. “We are continuing to look at the guidelines from leading medical organization that have been using decades of science to help guide their recommendations.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_1768-cropped2-e1767867295635-1024x682.jpeg,,,2026-01-08 05:58:49.981541

Rick Ladd, a Haverhill Republican, speaking to the House, Jan. 7, 2026. (Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)Ever since two state courts directed the Legislature to increase state spending on public schools, Republicans have made clear they disagree.
In its July decision in Contoocook Valley v. State of New Hampshire, known as the ConVal case, the New Hampshire Supreme Court found that the amount of money the state sends to support public schools is unconstitutionally low. The court called on lawmakers to fix the funding formula, but did not direct how or when. 
“It is now incumbent upon the legislative and executive branches to remedy the constitutional deficiency that we have identified,” the 3-2 majority opinion states.
But as lawmakers returned to the State House Wednesday, deep splits emerged between Republicans and Democrats over how to respond to that decision. 
Democratic lawmakers have called on their colleagues to follow a 2023 ruling by Rockingham Superior Court Judge David Ruoff, in which Ruoff found that the state needed to provide at least $7,356.01 per student to fulfill its duty to provide an adequate education
On Wednesday, Democrats argued for a bill to do just that. House Bill 651 would have honored Ruoff’s decision and required an immediate increase in spending on schools. 
But Republicans have been critical of Ruoff’s decision — much of which was upheld by the state Supreme Court last year — and they voted down HB 651 along party lines, 190-155. They have questioned both the conclusions reached by the court about school funding adequacy and the court’s very authority to instruct the Legislature to spend more. 
Speaking on the House floor, Rep. Rick Ladd, a Haverhill Republican and chairman of the House Education Funding Committee, urged the court to “stay out of the legislative lane.” 
“Trains sometimes jump the tracks, causing disastrous wrecks, and that is exactly what will occur in New Hampshire if the cost to provide a K-12 student education is left to the judicial branch,” Ladd said.  
The comments reflected a widely expressed position among Republicans: that last year’s ConVal ruling is not legitimate and does not need to be immediately followed. Yet other Republicans have expressed more moderation. In his own speech opposing HB 651, Rep. Walter Spillsbury, a Charlestown Republican, said the House Education Funding Committee would spend 2026 exploring how to respond to the ConVal decision and find a solution ahead of the 2027 budget cycle.

Senate President Sharon Carson, meanwhile, suggested the Republican Senate majority might have an answer to the ConVal ruling even sooner.   
“I’m going to ask you to hold tight and watch,” Carson said at a press conference Wednesday morning. She said Senate Republicans would soon produce a late-filed bill that would address the court ruling, but did not elaborate. 
Democrats in both chambers say the Legislature must respond more quickly to the courts and follow their decisions. HB 651 would have raised the base per-pupil amount of funding the state sends to schools from the current $4,266 to $7,356.01, the exact minimum amount identified by Ruoff in his 2023 decision. The bill would have also raised the additional “differentiated aid” — sent by the state to students who are low income, are English language learners, or who receive special education services — by similar levels. 
A separate Democratic bill, House Bill 491, would have created a study committee to look into “alternative methods” for funding public education to reduce reliance on property taxes. House Republicans also voted that bill down Wednesday, 195-157, after arguing a study committee is unnecessary and any analysis should be done in the existing education committee.
Addressing the House, Rep. Richard Ames, a Jaffrey Democrat, said HB 651 should have passed, noting the Supreme Court’s ruling came after three years of litigation and a three-week evidentiary trial. Ames said the court had reached a key conclusion: that New Hampshire local property tax burdens vary widely from town to town because the state is not sending enough funding to public schools to cover basic costs. 
Adopting the increases in HB 651 would allow New Hampshire to “meet, at an admittedly minimum level, our state constitutional school funding obligations,” Ames said.

Meanwhile, Rep. David Luneau, a Hopkinton Democrat, pushed back at the arguments that the Supreme Court had overstepped its authority. “The nonsense … about the Legislature having sole authority is an attack on separate but equal branches of government and violates our oath to uphold and defend the constitution,” he said. 
To many Republicans, following Ruoff’s ruling would be cost-prohibitive, forcing the state to raise around $500 million more in revenue per year for the Education Trust Fund to cover the $7,300 payments. Ladd noted that the court is asking the state to increase its per-pupil spending amounts at a time when New Hampshire schools are steadily losing enrollment. 
Instead, argued Ladd, the state’s school funding concerns should be answered by local school districts reducing their own budgets by cutting back on administrative costs.
“There are a number of considerations beyond revenue that should also be taken to address education funding, such as increased fiscal accountability and monitoring,” he said. 
On Wednesday, House Republicans passed two bills to attempt to enforce that financial discipline. House Bill 121 would require school districts to commission annual audits of their finances and would empower the State Board of Education to place school districts under probation if they are deemed to have conducted financial mismanagement or violated the law. That probationary period could allow the State Board, whose members are appointed by the governor and Executive Council, to choose an outside administrator to run the school district for up to two years. The bill passed, 187-154; it will need Senate approval next.
And the House was set to vote on an amended version of House Bill 675 Thursday, which would prohibit school districts’ annual budgets to increase beyond inflation every year unless a two-thirds majority of voters chose to override the cap. 
That latter proposal, once a relatively fringe idea in the Republican party, has grown in popularity in the last year, rising to become a central policy plank for House and Senate Republicans. 
Democrats have fiercely opposed the proposal, arguing it tramples on local control and prevents simple majorities of residents from being heard when it comes to school funding decisions. 
But Carson argued mandatory tax caps would force school boards to be more realistic about the need to downsize in the face of declining enrollments. “They’re not looking five, 10, years down the road at what’s going on in education and preparing for that,” she said of school boards. “That’s not the state’s fault. They’re doing budgeting that’s not taking account the reality of what’s happening in our state.”
One key Republican has held back on endorsing the budget cap proposal. Asked about the legislation at a press conference Wednesday, Gov. Kelly Ayotte declined to take a position. But she did echo some of her party’s sentiments. 
“I will say this: I do think that there has to be accountability at every level to taxpayers,” she said.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/P1075260-Ladd-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-08 05:12:17.636766

At the same time, the administration is trying to consolidate the bits of personal data held across federal agencies, creating a single trove of information on people who live in the United States.
Many left-leaning states and cities are trying to protect their residents’ personal information amid the immigration crackdown. But a growing number of conservative lawmakers also want to curb the use of surveillance technologies, such as automated license plate readers, that can be used to identify and track people.
Conservative-led states such as Arkansas, Idaho and Montana enacted laws last year designed to protect the personal data collected through license plate readers and other means. They joined at least five left-leaning states — Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York and Washington — that specifically blocked U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement from accessing their driver’s license records.
In addition, Democratic-led cities in Colorado, Illinois, Massachusetts, New York, North Carolina, Texas and Washington last year terminated their contracts with Flock Safety, the largest provider of license plate readers in the U.S.
The Trump administration’s goal is to create a “surveillance dragnet across the country,” said William Owen, communications director at the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project, a nonprofit that advocates for stronger privacy laws.










We're entering an increasingly dystopian era of high-tech surveillance.


– William Owen, communications director at the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project


“We’re entering an increasingly dystopian era of high-tech surveillance,” Owen said. Intelligence sharing between various levels of government, he said, has “allowed ICE to sidestep sanctuary laws and co-opt local police databases and surveillance tools, including license plate readers, facial recognition and other technologies.”
A new Montana law bars government entities from accessing electronic communications and related material without a warrant. Republican state Sen. Daniel Emrich, the law’s author, said “the most important thing that our entire justice system is based on is the principle against unlawful search and seizure” — the right enshrined in the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
“It’s tough to find individuals who are constitutionally grounded and understand the necessity of keeping the Fourth Amendment rights intact at all times for all reasons — with minimal or zero exceptions,” Emrich said in an interview.
ICE did not respond to Stateline’s requests for comment.
Automated license plate readers
Recently, cities and states have grown particularly concerned over the use of automated license plate readers (ALPRs), which are high-speed camera and computer systems that capture license plate information on vehicles that drive by. These readers sit on top of police cars and streetlights or can be hidden within construction barrels and utility poles.
Despite widespread interest, only 3 states passed license plate reader laws this year

Some cameras collect data that gets stored in databases for years, raising concerns among privacy advocates. One report from the Brennan Center for Justice, a progressive think tank at New York University, found the data can be susceptible to hacking. Different agencies have varying policies on how long they keep the data, according to the International Association of Chiefs of Police, a law enforcement advocacy group.
Supporters of the technology, including many in law enforcement, say the technology is a powerful tool for tracking down criminal suspects.
Flock Safety says it has cameras in more than 5,000 communities and is connected to more than 4,800 law enforcement agencies across 49 states. The company claims its cameras conduct more than 20 billion license plate reads a month. It collects the data and gives it to police departments, which use the information to locate people.
Holly Beilin, a spokesperson for Flock Safety, told Stateline that while there are local police agencies that may be working with ICE, the company does not have a contractual relationship with the agency. Beilin also said that many liberal and even sanctuary cities continue to sign contracts with Flock Safety. She noted that the cameras have been used to solve some high-profile crimes, including identifying and leading police to the man who committed the Brown University shooting and killed an MIT professor at the end of last year.
“Agencies and cities are very much able to use this technology in a way that complies with their values. So they do not have to share data out of state,” Beilin said.
Pushback over data’s use
But critics, such as the American Civil Liberties Union, say that Flock Safety’s cameras are not only “giving even the smallest-town police chief access to an enormously powerful driver-surveillance tool,” but also that the data is being used by ICE. One news outlet, 404 Media, obtained records of these searches and found many were being carried out by local officers on behalf of ICE.
Last spring, the Denver City Council unanimously voted to terminate its contract with Flock Safety, but Democratic Mayor Mike Johnston unilaterally extended the contract in October, arguing that the technology was a useful crime-fighting tool.
The ACLU of Colorado has vehemently opposed the cameras, saying last August that audit logs from the Denver Police Department show more than 1,400 searches had been conducted for ICE since June 2024.
Trump’s DOJ wants states to turn over voter lists, election info

“The conversation has really gotten bigger because of the federal landscape and the focus, not only on immigrants and the functionality of ICE right now, but also on the side of really trying to reduce and or eliminate protections in regards to access to reproductive care and gender affirming care,” Anaya Robinson, public policy director at the ACLU of Colorado.
“When we erode rights and access for a particular community, it’s just a matter of time before that erosion starts to touch other communities.”
Jimmy Monto, a Democratic city councilor in Syracuse, New York, led the charge to eliminate Flock Safety’s contract in his city.
“Syracuse has a very large immigrant population, a very large new American population, refugees that have resettled and been resettled here. So it’s a very sensitive issue,” Monto said, adding that license plate readers allow anyone reviewing the data to determine someone’s immigration status without a warrant.
“When we sign a contract with someone who is collecting data on the citizens who live in a city, we have to be hyper-focused on exactly what they are doing while we’re also giving police departments the tools that they need to also solve homicides, right?” Monto said.
“Certainly, if license plate readers are helpful in that way, I think the scope is right. But we have to make sure that that’s what we’re using it for, and that the companies that we are contracting with are acting in good faith.”
Emrich, the Montana lawmaker, said everyone should be concerned about protecting constitutional privacy rights, regardless of their political views.
“If the government is obtaining data in violation of constitutional rights, they could be violating a whole slew of individuals’ constitutional rights in pursuit of the individuals who may or may not be protected under those same constitutional rights,” he said.

Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/08/ct-partnership-insurance-plan-lost-23-million-last-fiscal-year/,The health plan for municipal and other public-sector workers outside CT government paid more in claims than it received in premiums in FY25.,"The state-run health plan for municipal and other public-sector employees outside of state government paid almost $23 million more in claims than it collected in member premiums last fiscal year, according to a new report from Comptroller Sean Scanlon’s office.
But Scanlon said this week the Connecticut Partnership Plan remains fiscally sound and generally has performed in the black since member premiums were adjusted in 2019.
“The partnership plan, like every other health plan in the United States of America, had a tough time last year,” Scanlon said, referring to surging hospital service fees and medical inflation in general.
Since the early years of the coronavirus outbreak in 2020 and 2021, hospitals have been pressed to raise wages to avert staff shortages while federal Medicaid and Medicare payments failed to keep pace with medical inflation, according to the American Hospital Association. Patients also have been coming to facilities in greater numbers, and with more complex health problems, since the pandemic.
The plan paid out nearly $731.4 million in claims in the 2024-25 fiscal year, which wrapped last June 30, about $22.6 million more than the premiums it collected from the roughly 60,000 public-sector workers and their family members that it serves.
That data, included in Scanlon’s latest report on the program, sparked a sharp response from minority Republicans in the General Assembly.
Sen. Tony Hwang of Fairfield, ranking Senate Republican on the Insurance and Real Estate Committee, and Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding of Brookfield, called it “a precursor to universal, single-payer health care in Connecticut” in a joint statement.
The legislature voted in 2015 to establish the partnership to give municipal and other non-state public-sector workers another option for health coverage besides the plan offered by their municipality or regional governmental entity. Of Connecticut’s 169 cities and towns, 109 have a least a portion of their workers covered through the partnership.
The comptroller’s office administers the program and contracts with private companies to manage benefits.
In its first two fiscal years of operation, the plan paid out $31 million more for claims than it received in premiums.
The legislature responded by changing premium calculations, which triggered higher fees for many enrollees.
Hwang and Harding also noted state officials transferred nearly $40 million from an emergency federal COVID-relief grant into the partnership five years ago to keep the program balance healthy.
And, Republican lawmakers asked, if state officials will tamper with this public program to keep it afloat rather than rely on the private insurance industry to cover these public-sector workers, what other state-sponsored health coverage programs are coming? 
But Scanlon, a Guilford Democrat, said the partnership plan is healthy, despite last fiscal year’s numbers — and GOP posturing.
“I guess the clock struck 2026 and it’s campaign season, and the Senate Republicans are dusting off their playbook of old tropes and scare tactics,” he said.
Scanlon added that “I don’t view that [2025 performance] as a harbinger of impending doom and crisis,” he said. “I view that as what’s happening to everybody is happening to us.”
But programs like the partnership and insurance plans offered by private companies have to struggle with rising hospital and other medical costs — a problem that could get worse in future years as huge cuts in federal health care funding make it harder for more and more Americans to regularly visit a primary care physician.
The comptroller added that since lawmakers reformed the premium-setting process, premium collections have exceeded claim payments in four of the last six years. And over longer periods of time, most plans finish periodically in the red, he said.
Scanlon added that his office “is working always to find ways to save,” including trying to negotiate savings each year by steering participants to generic prescription drugs when possible.
“We’re not just accepting these increases as a fait accompli we can do nothing about,” he said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025_0910_SR_StudentLoanRoundtable_139-1024x682.jpg,,,2026-01-08 05:12:17.636766

The academic Society of Family Planning, a group who supports “equitable abortion and contraception informed by science,” released their most recent report on the number of abortions in the nation, and the way in which those services are provided and protected from state to state.
The new WeCount report noted provider-conducted abortions, both medication and surgical, that were completed by a licensed clinician in the U.S., via medical office, hospital or telehealth, between January and June 2025.
Nationwide, the report found more than 500,000 abortions were given in that time period, and 27% of abortions in the first half of 2025 were done through a telehealth service.
The use of telehealth services has increased since the WeCount surveys began in 2022, with usage up from 25% in 2024 and just 5% in 2022, researchers stated.
Most of the increases were in the 13 states with “shield laws,” that is protections for medical professionals who provide abortions in states where abortion is banned or restricted.
Nearly 15,000 abortions per month were provided under shield laws by June 2025, the study stated.
“Telehealth has become a lifeline for people accessing abortion care, especially those in states with abortion bans,” according to Ushma Upadhyay, a professor at the University of California, San Francisco, in a statement announcing the WeCount findings. “But this care is under assault by abortion opponents’ relentless attacks on mifepristone and telehealth.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXOhio has a constitutional amendment that protects abortion services, which passed with 57% of the vote in 2023. But legislation in the Ohio General Assembly has caused concern for physicians and pro-abortion advocates about how protected not only abortion itself will be in the future, but telehealth access specifically.
Ohio has also seen legal debate over telehealth, in a case in which a Hamilton County court has blocked a 2021 law prohibiting telehealth abortions three times.
Dr. Alison Norris, a public health professor at Ohio State University spoke out against a bill recently passed out of the Ohio House that would require an in-person exam and follow-up for any drug categorized as having severe adverse effects in more than 5% of users. She spoke in the House Health Committee in October, saying the level of scrutiny on reports of severe adverse effects needs to be higher than the bill allowed. She also said limiting the ability for Ohioans to use telehealth would impact many people on many medications, but would directly impact medication abortion access as well.
Norris is listed as a co-chair of the just-released WeCount study, and is also a co-principal investigator for the Ohio Policy Evaluation Network, a group of academics and medical professionals who research the state of contraception and abortion care in the state.
As legislation continues to make the rounds in the Ohio Statehouse that would directly and indirectly impact reproductive health care, Norris said even in a state with protections, diligence when it comes to measures holding abortion care providers to different standards is needed to make sure legislation doesn’t effectively create bans.
“Abortion bans don’t stop people from needing and pursuing essential abortion care,” said Norris, who is also co-chair for the Society of Family Planning’s WeCount study. “Telehealth is helping people in states with bans to access abortion care – and yet it isn’t the answer for everyone. Abortion bans are causing harm (in other states), and all too often, your access to health care depends on where you live and how much money you have.”
Despite a patchwork of coverage and protections from state to state, the U.S. has still seen an increase in abortions, from an average of 80,000 monthly abortions in 2022 to 99,000 per month from January and June of this year, according to the society’s study.

(Photo by Molly Rains/New Hampshire Bulletin)On its first day back in session, the New Hampshire Senate considered multiple bills held over from last session on waste regulation, continuing a long-running discussion on the topic and upholding the trend of Senate and House divergence on the matter.
On Wednesday, senators passed an amended version of House Bill 707, legislation retained from last session that proposes a new process for landfill site evaluation.
Under the bill, landfill proposals would be considered by a seven-member committee evaluating a set list of criteria. HB 707 also calls for state regulatory and policy interests to take precedence over “local regulations and restrictions” in the landfill siting process, citing “a compelling state interest in maintaining adequate, reasonably priced disposal capacity for solid waste generated in New Hampshire.”
Those provisions are contained in a replace-all amendment authored by Sen. Howard Pearl, a Loudon Republican; with Pearl’s amendment, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee recommended the bill, 5-0, in October.
At the time, some representatives who had sponsored the House bill reacted negatively to the Senate’s amendment, including prime sponsor Rep. Kelley Potenza, a Rochester Republican. As approved by the House, earlier versions of the bill also sought to reform the landfill siting process. But Potenza said in October the criteria in the Senate amendment were not stringent enough. The amendment sacrificed local control, she said, while giving concessions to the waste industry.
Sen. David Rochefort, a Littleton Republican, said Wednesday the amended bill was “targeted” at one project in particular: a landfill in Bethlehem owned by Vermont-based Casella Waste Systems. 
The town of Bethlehem has attempted to regulate the landfill at the local level, through town votes and a legal agreement with Casella. As amended, Rochefort said, the bill could take those decisions out of residents’ hands.
In a letter sent to lawmakers on Tuesday, the Bethlehem Select Board also expressed opposition to the amended bill.
“Local officials are best positioned to weigh competing interests, impose appropriate conditions, and respond to site-specific impacts. State-level preemption of these responsibilities sets a troubling precedent that extends well beyond landfill regulation,” the board wrote.
On Wednesday, Rochefort introduced a floor amendment he said would strengthen local control in the siting process outlined by the bill. He also rejected the argument that increased landfill capacity would be a significant public benefit, saying the state had enough capacity to dispose of its waste in its currently operational landfills. 
Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee members David Watters, a Dover Democrat, and Cindy Rosenwald, a Nashua Democrat, spoke in favor of the floor amendment. But Pearl spoke against it, saying its financial impact was unknown.
The amendment ultimately failed, 12-12; soon after, the Senate voted in favor of the amended version of HB 707. The amended bill will return to the House for further discussion this session.
Later on Wednesday, the Senate passed another bill aimed at regulating waste: House Bill 451, establishing a drop-off paint can recycling program, passed 13-11. 
Senators also considered two more waste-related bills held over from last year on the consent calendar: House Bill 171, establishing a moratorium on new landfills, was voted inexpedient to legislate, while Senate Bill 226, which also called for a moratorium on new landfills as well as the study of incineration as a disposal method, was referred for interim study.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/senate2-1.7.26-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-08 04:57:24.761367

Is that your experience?
Do Ohio politicians have an outstanding record of winning big for Ohio residents? Do you feel like they are looking out for you?
Have they turned Ohio into a destination among our 50 states? Making life affordable for Ohio families? Providing top-notch education? Access to health care? Access to opportunity? A thriving climate for both entrepreneurs and workers? The best roads, bridges, and transportation infrastructure? Public safety, quality of life?
Is Ohio a beacon of democracy for voters? Are voters respected? Are our elected officials accountable, mindful, and responsive to the needs and wishes of everyday Ohioans, and not beholden to narrow special interests or corporate influence?
What candidates are running for statewide office in Ohio in 2026?

Perhaps you think yes. Perhaps you think no.
You’re in luck either way.
This year, you will get to decide, Ohio voter.
You get to decide whether the Buckeye State is “on the right track” or “heading in the wrong direction,” as the pollsters love to put it.
Every single statewide executive office is up for open election: Ohio governor, attorney general, secretary of state, auditor, and treasurer.
We also have two Ohio Supreme Court races to decide, and another U.S. Senate election for the third congressional cycle in a row.
Ohio Republicans are trying to hold onto the control over all three branches of state government they’ve had since 2011.
Ohio Democrats are trying to win their first statewide executive branch offices since 2006.
It’s been eight years since we last had open races for these executive offices.
Each of the current incumbents won reelection in 2022, but all are term-limited out of seeking reelection again, though three are attempting to shuffle from their current position into a different statewide executive office.
So what are the big highlights in Ohio over the last seven years?
I’ll just get out of the way and share some significant headlines from the Ohio Capital Journal and other news outlets throughout Ohio, and you can decide for yourselves what you make of it, as you consider what you think ought to happen next.

Six years ago, it seemed like the Midwest was well on its way to building the first offshore wind farm in the Great Lakes. Then the project withered on the vine — and a civil lawsuit puts the blame on utility FirstEnergy’s bribery scheme in Ohio.


That corruption scandal is best known for leading to the 2019 passage of House Bill 6, a law that gutted the state’s clean energy standards and forced consumers to pay nearly half a billion dollars in subsidies for uneconomical coal plants.


But the bribes also led to a regulatory decision that effectively killed the Icebreaker wind farm proposed off Cleveland’s shore, claims the lawsuit filed in July by Lake Erie Energy Development Corp. — the nonprofit that spent more than a decade trying to launch the clean energy project.


The group, known as LEEDCo, zeroes in on FirstEnergy’s bribes to Sam Randazzo, who formerly headed both the state’s Power Siting Board and Public Utilities Commission. LEEDCo argues that those payments led to a 2020 ruling that imposed unworkable restrictions on when the Icebreaker project’s turbines could operate. By the time the restrictions were revoked, funding for Icebreaker had collapsed. The nonprofit is suing FirstEnergy for monetary damages that could top $10 million.


Icebreaker ​“represented a generational opportunity for the region,” said Jay Kelley, managing partner at Elk & Elk and one of the lawyers representing LEEDCo. ​“It would have positioned Cleveland as a national leader in offshore wind, created a new advanced-manufacturing supply chain, supported jobs, and strengthened the region’s climate-resilience and economic-development goals.”

The Icebreaker demonstration project called for six turbines to be built approximately 8 miles northwest of Cleveland. Although relatively small, its roughly 20 megawatts of clean electricity would have been enough to power thousands of homes. Just as important to LEEDCo was proving that offshore wind generation was feasible in the freshwater lake. If so, proponents in the public and private sectors hoped to leverage the region’s strengths in engineering, steelmaking, maritime, and other fields to help the sector take off.


“The big dream was to build an industry here,” recalled Lorry Wagner, who served as LEEDCo’s first executive director until he retired in late 2019.


By that time, the organization had spent millions of dollars on offshore wind studies, and it had lined up the developer Fred. Olsen Renewables to build Icebreaker once approvals came through. In 2018, the project cleared the federal government’s environmental review process. LEEDCo was also deep into discussions with several Ohio agencies and had applied for a permit from the Ohio Power Siting Board.


By May 2019, LEEDCo had agreed to various permit conditions supported by the Power Siting Board’s staff, two environmental groups, a trade association, and a carpenters’ union. After a hearing that autumn on the fairness of that settlement, the project’s only remaining hurdle was to get the board’s final approval.


When that ruling finally came in May 2020, the board, led by Randazzo, imposed a whole new condition: Every night from March through December of each year, Icebreaker’s turbines would have to ​“feather,” or shut down.


“When it came out, everybody was shocked,” Wagner said.


LEEDCo appealed to the Power Siting Board to remove the restrictions. A bipartisan group of 32 lawmakers urged Randazzo to reverse the ruling. Republican Gov. Mike DeWine’s office fielded similar complaints. The board finally removed the ​“poison pill” provision in October 2020, although Randazzo remained highly critical of Icebreaker.


By then, however, Fred. Olsen had withdrawn from the project. According to LEEDCo, that loss of both funding and technical expertise meant it could no longer meet its obligations for a grant from the U.S. Department of Energy. When the Ohio Supreme Court later upheld the permit without the ​“poison pill” in 2022, LEEDCo still didn’t have new funding. On Dec. 8, 2023, LEEDCo said it was freezing Icebreaker.


 What was FirstEnergy’s role?

Just a few days before LEEDCo paused Icebreaker, the federal government indicted Randazzo on criminal bribery, fraud, and conspiracy charges related to HB 6 and other matters. He also faced criminal charges from the state of Ohio and the prospect of losing his law license.

FirstEnergy admitted in 2021 that it paid $4.3 million to one of Randazzo’s companies shortly before Gov. DeWine nominated him to lead the Public Utilities Commission. According to that federal court filing, the payment was in return for Randazzo taking official action on HB 6, along with ​“other specific FirstEnergy Corp. legislative and regulatory priorities, as requested and as opportunities arose.”


LEEDCo claims that stopping the Icebreaker project fell into the general category of other opportunities in which Randazzo furthered FirstEnergy’s interests. The nonprofit alleges in its filings that FirstEnergy thought competition from the Icebreaker project would cost its subsidiaries more than $5 million in lost revenue per year.


LEEDCo wants the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas to make FirstEnergy pay monetary damages to make up for the alleged wrongdoings: interference in LEEDCo’s contracts and business relations, along with corruption and conspiracy in violation of Ohio law.


“Pursuing relief is not only justified — it is necessary to make LEEDCo whole for the years of investment, planning, and opportunity lost,” Kelley said, adding that when wrongful conduct delays or derails a project like this, it doesn’t just hurt one company. ​“It holds back an entire region’s ability to compete and innovate.”


FirstEnergy asked the court to dismiss the case in August, arguing that LEEDCo’s allegations are based on insufficient evidence and that too much time has passed since the alleged wrongdoing. FirstEnergy spokesperson Jennifer Young said the company has no further comment beyond its case filings.


LEEDCo filed its brief against the motion to dismiss in October. Judge Cassandra Collier-Williams has scheduled the next case conference for late January.


If the case moves ahead to pretrial fact-finding, called discovery, LEEDCo will gain access to various FirstEnergy documents, and the nonprofit’s lawyers will be able to question people under oath. But LEEDCo may need to make its case without testimony from some key witnesses.


Randazzo died in April 2024, so he can’t testify about his arrangements with FirstEnergy or any documents concerning Icebreaker. Randazzo forwarded at least one Icebreaker-related document to himself, using an email connected to one of his companies that received money from FirstEnergy.


The Fifth Amendment would likely protect former FirstEnergy executives Chuck Jones and Michael Dowling from making statements that could be used as evidence against them in criminal cases. FirstEnergy’s lawyers identified Jones and Dowling as people who paid the bribes in the HB 6 scandal. The two men still face charges in state and federal court.


Icebreaker, for its part, has changed hands.


Maryland-based developer Mighty Waves Energy, which is not part of the lawsuit against FirstEnergy, acquired the remaining permit rights for the project last year and is working on meeting the Power Siting Board’s preconstruction conditions. But even if it can do that and get enough people to agree to buy the project’s power, Mighty Waves may well face headwinds, including high interest rates and the Trump administration’s persistent attacks on renewable energy.

(Getty Images)I overlooked my flu shot this winter. Over the Christmas holiday, I paid the price.
My entire family was felled by the flu. I’m not talking about cold-like symptoms for a couple of days. I’m talking about total immobilization, hacking coughs and fevers above 102 F. It was misery. We had to cancel family celebrations on Dec. 25, reconvening a couple of days later.
Even after the worst of the illness had passed, we all spent a second week working through fatigue, coughing fits and brain fog.
Data from Kansas and across these United States shows that we were far from alone. Information from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the week ending Dec. 27 shows influenza at a “very high” level in the state. The Kansas Department of Health and Environment reports 424 deaths this flu season from respiratory viruses, after 1,482 deaths the previous season.
Nationally, at least 5,000 have died this flu season, with nine of those deaths among children, according to the CDC.
“There’s no doubt about it,” said Michael Phillips of the NYU Grossman School of Medicine to NBC’s Today. “It’s an unusual season. It’s been severe, with a rapid onset.”
The tidal wave of infection bore down even as I wrote this column. Wednesday evening, the University of Kansas Health System revealed that more than 100 patients had been hospitalized with both the flu and similar illnesses.
So yes, you can count this one as the real deal. After years of grappling with COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus (known as RSV), it might sound comforting to confront the familiar old flu. But this variant, identified as subclade K of the H3N2 variety, has torn through the world. Over in the United Kingdom, the ever-sedate press has dubbed it the “super flu.”
So we’ve established that it’s a problem. What should you do about it? What should my family and I have done?
First and most importantly, we should have been vaccinated. While this season’s vaccine doesn’t specifically protect against subclade K, evidence suggests it protects against severe illness. The more people get vaccinated, of course, the greater protection against illness across the community.
We couldn’t have elevated Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. at a worse time. He has overseen this week’s evisceration of the childhood vaccine schedule, in which officials no longer recommend protecting kids against hepatitis A, hepatitis B, influenza, meningitis, respiratory syncytial virus and rotavirus.
Children will die. They already have, this flu season. When ideology trumps public health or common sense, no one bothers much about the corpses of defenseless kids.
But I digress.
All the measures promoted by public health officials during the COVID-19 pandemic remain sensible. Wear a mask to protect both you and others. Wash your hands. Stay at home if you become sick. Don’t force yourself to work or otherwise exert yourself while feeling ill. Rest, drink plenty of fluids and contact health care professionals as needed.
“When you can test early, and if you find out that you have influenza, there is an antiviral that we use to treat that, will help reduce your chance of complications,” said the University of Kansas Medical Center’s Dana Hawkinson in an interview with KSHB-TV.
Back in the darkest days of the pandemic, many of us hoped for more.
Back then, folks who care about the well-being of other Kansans imagined that we might begin a new era, one in which officials supported public health and reliable science. Millions of lives could be saved over the years as we prioritized vaccinations and looked out for one another.
Instead, antiscience and antisocial ideologues exploited public fear for personal gain. They promoted snake oil cures instead of actual medicine. They spread conspiracy theories about lifesaving vaccines. They promoted the fallacious idea that individual liberty meant the right to infect and kill your loved ones.
They got the better of the argument. Scientists and politicians too often stumbled in those fast-moving early days, opening the door for Kennedy and his fellow charlatans to prance through merrily.
Now we all pay for that freedom. Those 5,000 Americans and nine children have paid for our right to cough in public, to turn up our noses at shots, to vote for a would-be autocrat who gives the best medical care to his friends while tossing millions off Medicaid. I’m sure they would all eagerly support that bargain if they could speak to us now.
Again, I digress. But not really.
Let this flu season serve as a reminder that respiratory viruses crash the party every winter, whether you acknowledge them or not. When a particularly virulent variant comes to town, it doesn’t care how tough you act or how much you hate doctors and nurses.
It will lay you out flat and make you beg for mercy.

Steny Hoyer (D-5th) will announce Thursday that he will not seek reelection this fall, capping a 60-year career in state and federal politics that saw him become a legendary figure in Maryland politics and the second-ranking Democrat in the U.S. House.
Hoyer’s office Wednesday night confirmed the news, first reported by Politico, that the congressman’s 22nd term in Congress will be his last, and that he would announce it on the House floor at 10 a.m. Thursday. Hoyer posted a simple statement on social media Wednesday night, saying only that he will speak on the House floor at that time.
Hoyer’s departure could open up a free-for-all among state Democrats who are now free to run for a seat that was considered Hoyer’s, a well-funded, well-liked and well-connected incumbent who proved impossible to unseat by the few Democrats, and decades of Republicans, who tried.
Some of the Democrats whose names have been mentioned as possible contenders for the now-open 5th District seat include Dels. Adrian Boafo and Nicole Williams, both from Prince George’s County, and former Bowie Mayor Tim Adams. Former Del. Jazz Lewis, a Prince George’s Democrat who once served as Hoyer’s campaign manager, was long considered a possible replacement, but his recent decision to step down from the legislature for a job as a lobbyist for the University of Maryland has put that in doubt.
In a brief interview Wednesday night, Williams said she’s giving “strong consideration” to seeking the seat. After confirmation was made that Hoyer would not seek reelection, Williams said she received text messages and phone calls from individuals throughout the state.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“I’m really flattered that people have seen the work that I have done over the years as an elected official, even before I was even serving as a state delegate,” she said. “I do have to think seriously about whether I’m going to formally put my name before the voters of the 5th Congressional District for consideration.”
But she stressed Wednesday it’s all about Hoyer and his legacy for now.
“First and foremost, I just want to thank Congressman Hoyer for all of his years of service to Prince George’s County, to the 5th Congressional District, to the state of Maryland and really to the nation,” she said. “He is going to leave big shoes for us to fill. This is big news for our state and our nation. I’m just happy to be a witness and a part of it. I have literally seen what he has done for the residents of the 5th Congressional District.”
According to the Maryland State Board of Elections, five Democrats had filed already — some as early as last March — to run for the seat that includes the three Southern Maryland counties of Charles, Calvert and St. Mary’s as well as portions of Prince George’s and Anne Arundel counties.
The will-he-or-won’t-he game has become a biennial exercise for Democrats as Hoyer aged. He will be 87 by the time of the fall election, but appears fit and capable and has been coy when asked directly in recent months, replying with variations of “we haven’t made a decision.” He even danced at his annual bull roast in June.
Hoyer, elected to the U.S. House in 1981, is currently the third-longest serving member of the chamber. He served as the No. 2 Democrat behind Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the California Democrat with Baltimore roots, from 2007 to 2023, when both Pelosi and Hoyer said they would step down from their leadership posts to make way for a younger generation of Democratic leaders.
But Hoyer’s career in politics began long before he was elected to Congress, when he served from 1962 to 1966 as a staffer in the office of U.S. Sen. Daniel Brewster (D-Md.) — where one of his fellow staffers was Pelosi, the daughter Baltimore Mayor Thomas D’Alesandro Jr. and sister of Thomas D’Alesandro III, who also served as mayor.

Hoyer won a seat in the Maryland Senate in 1966 at the age of 27, and became the body’s youngest president in 1975. He lost a primary bid for  lieutenant governor in 1978, as the running mate of then-Acting Gov. Blair Lee III. But Hoyer made his political comeback in 1981 when he won a special election to replace Rep. Gladys Noon Spellman (D), who became incapacitated after suffering a heart attack and subsequently lapsed into a coma.
He’s held the seat ever since. The 5th District then was largely a suburban Prince George’s County district when Hoyer first won it, but it was redrawn after the 1990 Census to include all of Southern Maryland. Still, Hoyer has rarely faced a significant challenge in either configuration of the district.
In the House, he was seen as a moderate counterbalance to the more-liberal Pelosi.
Hoyer’s years of service on the Appropriations Committee — which he returned to after stepping down from leadership — allowed him to look out for his district in terms of funding.
His years of service also made his endorsement a valuable one for Democrats in the state and in Prince George’s County, where a research facility at National Archives II is named for him.
His tenure has also allowed him to foster the careers of many rising Democrats — including freshman Rep. Sarah Elfreth (D-3rd), who was an intern in his office — some of whom are expected to be in the hunt to replace him now that he’s leaving.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DSC_0581-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-08 01:56:29.997427

(Photo courtesy of Kim Rexroat)This is such an exciting time of year for us Florida columnists! The 2026 legislative session begins next Tuesday, and we’re all waiting to see which piece of legislation will win the coveted title of the Worst Bill of the Year. I’ve already chosen my nominee.
There are sooooo many possibilities. There’s a bill to block the removal of Confederate monuments, because nobody deserves honor more than traitors who took up arms against the United States. I assume we’ll soon begin building monuments to the Jan. 6 insurrectionists, too.
Another bill would require teachers to take loyalty oaths, because it’s always a great idea to copy Sen. Joe McCarthy. In fact, why not require teachers to swear their loyalty to Mr. Red Scare, too?
There’s also a bill that would ban the display of Pride flags at any government office in the allegedly “Free” State of Florida. Sorry, “freedom” is available only to people who vote the government-approved way.
But my pick for the worst of the worst is House Bill 479. This bill would ban cities and counties from imposing “laws, regulations, rules, or policies” to protect wetlands and prevent water pollution.

How bad is it? “The impacts of it are incredibly broad,” said Matt Singer of the Florida League of Cities. “This is a world-ender.”
Local government needs to be involved in regulating these water and wetland issues because they’re better able to tailor their actions to fit local circumstances, said Gil Smart of VoteWater.org.
“This bill would just blow that up,” Smart told me.
Cragin Mosteller via Florida Association of Counties
The bill is titled “Land and Water Management,” but I think that’s misleading. In the interest of accuracy, it should be called “Lack of Any Land and Water Management.”
Cragin Mosteller of the Florida Association of Counties suggested an even better name: the “I Hate Water Bill.”
Do expect pollution
Mosteller pointed out that clean water “is very important to our quality of life in Florida. It should be protected.”
Instead, this bill orders local governments to leave the job of controlling pollution and saving wetlands to a state agency, the Florida Department of Environmental Pro –  HA HA HA HA HA!
Sorry, I can never get through that word “Protection” without cracking up.
Why do I react that way to the DEP? Because this is the agency that’s been dragging its feet since 2017 on cleaning up the state’s outstanding springs, despite clear orders from the Legislature.
Florida is ranked No. 1 in the U.S for polluted lakes — in fact, our largest, Lake Okeechobee, has been named the most polluted lake in the nation. Florida’s longest river, the St. Johns, is coping with steadily increasing pollution from septic waste.
Perhaps most telling of all is what happened when a pollution-fueled algae bloom killed off so much seagrass in the Indian River Lagoon that 2,000 manatees starved to death. A federal judge ruled that by failing to stop the pollution, the DEP had violated the Endangered Species Act.
As for wetlands, Florida developers tried for years to get the DEP to be put in charge of issuing federal wetland permits. They finally got their wish at the tail end of the first Trump administration, when the feds handed over their authority to the DEP.
Four years later, a federal judge ruled the DEP was so intent on cranking out wetlands destruction permits as fast as possible that it had done an illegal end run around the Endangered Species Act. The decision is being appealed, but his ruling calling out the DEP for failing to protect manatees is hard to ignore.
In other words, in Florida the initials “DEP” actually stand for “Do Expect Pollution.”
Passing this bill to put every bit of wetlands and pollution protection in the hands of the DEP would be about as smart as assigning the Cookie Monster to guard the Publix bakery.
The nest and the nephew

“This bill doesn’t make any sense,” Kim Dinkins of the smart-growth group 1000 Friends of Florida told me. “We stand to lose a lot more than we might gain if it passes.”
But the bill makes perfect sense if you know its origin story.
HB 479 is sponsored by Rep. Randy Maggard, who comes from a politically well-connected family in Pasco County. His brother is a business partner of state Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson and is married to the sister of a Pasco commissioner.
I mention this because this new bill is nearly identical to one that Maggard filed in 2023 after his nephew, Zach Maggard, had a problem with Pasco County.
State Rep. Randy Maggard vis Florida House

Soon after Zach Maggard bought a lot in a subdivision called Lake Jovita Golf & Country Club, his neighbors noticed something disturbing. As I reported at the time, a large eagle nest on that property, one that had been there for 27 years, suddenly disappeared — and no, it wasn’t knocked down by a storm. The tree was still there, but there was no trace of the nest.
Upset neighbors and outraged bird advocates called officials from Pasco County, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to figure out who illegally destroyed the nest.
The investigators were unable to pin the crime on anyone, but they noticed that the wetlands shown on Zach Maggard’s building plans did not match the wetlands on the ground.
A county building official ordered a new wetlands map and further scrutinized the situation. The big fight turned out to be over a 12-foot “walkway” down to the lake — one that clearly wasn’t going to be a walkway but a concrete driveway for a boat ramp.
The Pasco building official suggested making the “walkway” out of some permeable material, so water could continue to flow through it. Zach Maggard didn’t like the idea. 
I was told that Maggard went over the building official’s head. The project got approved — although not by the building official who’d actually been on the scene.
The bottom line: Rep. Maggard told me in 2023 that he filed this bill because his nephew did some things that Pasco officials objected to, yet paid no penalty for them. He seemed intent on punishing the regulators for trying to interfere with his nephew’s plans.
Maggard’s original bill crashed and burned, and the eagles rebuilt their Lake Jovita nest.
“This beautiful eagle pair is currently raising two very young eaglets,” Kim Rexroat, Audubon Florida’s eagle watch coordinator for Pasco, told me this week.
Maggard’s awful bill is back too, just like a bad penny.
The sponsor
I tried several times to talk to Rep. Maggard about him filing the worst bill of the 2026 session. Alas, he never called me back. Perhaps he was too busy dancing in delight after hearing about his nomination for Worst Bill.
But he did acknowledge to me in 2023 about how he had turned the Lake Jovita situation involving his nephew into a legislative attack on all 67 counties and 400 or so cities across the state.
That interview lingers in my memory as both the funniest and most painful conversation (I actually bit my tongue) I’ve ever had with a Florida politician.
At first, our discussion was confusing. Rep. Maggard kept saying the word “duplicitous” but after a while I figured out he was using it to mean something other than “deceptive.” When I finally asked him if he meant people were lying about his bill, he said no.
“To me, ‘duplicitous’ means you’re duplicating something,” he said, explaining he thought all the local water and wetland regulations were just duplicates of the state ones (they’re not).
Maggard also told me he was in favor of protecting our clean water from pollution, but “why do the customers, the consumers, the citizens have to go through all these hurdles?” He didn’t see the role that regulation plays in preventing pollution from tainting our water supply.
And now he’s trying to end all the non-DEP regulations.
Sprawl on steroids
Rep. Maggard is far from alone in this ill-considered pursuit.
Sen. Stan McClain via Florida House
There’s a companion bill in the other chamber, SB 718, just as there was in 2023. The 2023 bill was sponsored by Sen. Danny Burgess, whose law partner iswas another of Maggard’s nephews. This year, the Senate version of the bill this year is sponsored by Ocala’s Sen. Stan McClain.
If that name sounds familiar, it’s because he’s behind quite a few pro-development bills. One is the bill creating “Blue Ribbon” developments that don’t have to obey local zoning rules or pay attention to what the public wants.
Smart of the VoteWater organization suggested that that’s why McCain is supporting Maggard’s bill, too. By shutting local governments out of water pollution and wetlands regulation, he said, the public gets silenced as well. The DEP rarely holds public hearings on individual permits.
“A lot of this is to cut the public out of the process,” Smart said.
McClain, by the way, happens to be a homebuilder in Marion County. In fact, his legislative website says he’s executive officer of the Marion County Building Industry Association.
Environmental advocates dubbed the legislative session a couple of years back as “The Year of Sprawl.” Thanks to McClain, Smart said, “This is the Year of Sprawl on Steroids.”
Drink up
The Legislature has spent a lot of energy over the past few years trying to handcuff local governments to prevent them from doing things that upset major campaign contrib– er, I mean, fine, upstanding citizens who just happen to sit on very big wallets.
But this goes beyond that. This is a bill designed to let polluters run amok, even if the result threatens all our health.
If anyone tries to resist, Maggard’s bill contains a strong penalty to stop them. If any city or county persists in trying to protect its citizens from pollution, the DEP is ordered to notify the state’s chief financial officer. 
Then, per the bill, the CFO is supposed to withhold state funds from those local governments, effectively killing their ability to pay for police, fire departments, solid waste, libraries, and so forth.
Both have been referred to not one, not two, but THREE committees.
Perhaps, as happened in 2023, the process of wading through multiple committees will slow them down too much to pass.
I’d like to make sure Rep. Maggard really understands the importance of Florida water quality.
Here’s my plan: We hire a fancy calligrapher to draft a lovely invitation to notify Rep. Maggard that he’s been chosen for a major award.
We invite him to the Worst Bill awards ceremony at the Governor’s Inn in Tallahassee, which I hear is quite the hot venue for political shindigs in our state capital.
Then, when Rep. Maggard shows up, ready to accept his award, we hand him a large glass of ugly, nasty, polluted water and say, “You made that. It’s yours. Now drink it all.”",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Lake-Jovita-eagle-1-by-Kim-Rexroat-1024x819.jpg,,,2026-01-08 00:11:45.056421
,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-08 05:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,CT must invest in better rehabilitation,Caitlin Doherty,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/08/ct-must-invest-in-better-rehabilitation/,Connecticut spends millions of dollars on reincarcerating people. Yet it already has a solution to the problem within its own system.,"Some 50% of people who are incarcerated in Connecticut are back in prison within three years of release. 
People reentering their communities after being in prison often struggle. They have difficulties being hired, finding housing, and receiving the support that they need. Without stability, they fall back into the circumstances that led them to being incarcerated initially, and they are then rearrested. 
The cycle of recidivism cannot be blamed on the people caught within this system. Rather, we as taxpayers and voters must realize the prison system that we fund and enable is not fulfilling its supposed purpose. 



The CT Department of Correction’s stated mission is “to be a leader in progressive correctional practices and partnered re-entry initiatives to support responsive evidence-based practices geared toward supporting reintegration and reducing recidivism under the Department’s supervision.” Yet the state of Connecticut has one of the highest recidivism rates nationally. As community members, voters, and taxpayers, we have a duty to demand better of our state’s Department of Corrections so that people who are incarcerated will not be stuck in a lifelong cycle of recidivism. 
Fortunately, we already have a blueprint of how to do this.
Established in 2017, the T.R.U.E. (Truthfulness, Respectfulness, Understanding, and Elevating) unitat Cheshire Correctional Institution offers a potential pathway to lower recidivism. Modelled after the German prison system, this program pairs 18-25 year-olds serving shorter sentences with older mentors serving life sentences to help the younger men prepare to reenter their communities. Both mentors and mentees voluntarily apply to participate in the program, and mentors complete training in therapeutic practices before they are partnered with a mentee. 
They live in a unit of the prison together with specially trained correctional officers. Every morning, participants check in with each other about their goals for the day, and mentors have conversations with the younger men about the difficult realities they will face in reentering their communities. They have access to a library, a barber shop, and a room with chalkboards to share ideas and concerns. They also participate in classes and workshops on anything from slam poetry to crafting a resume and preparing for job interviews. Participants are given mock salaries, pay mock taxes and rent, and are fined if they violate a rule. 
In short, they actively work toward their successful reentry into society.

The mentoring relationship between the younger and older participants centers on healing, discipline, accountability, and growth. “The important thing about this program is we try and hold them accountable for everything they do,’” said one mentor in the program in an interview with the Council of State Governments Justice Center. Mentors and mentees work together to build emotional skills and plan for reentry to break the cycle of recidivism. 
Voters and policymakers need to prioritize expanding this model to other prisons throughout the state, so that others might benefit from this programming in the same ways T.R.U.E. participants have.
In T.R.U.E., interactions between participants and correctional officers are much less punitive than in the prison population more generally. Some may think that correctional officers would not want to participate in this program because it is different and less punitive than their normal approach. However, staff at Cheshire were excited to participate in this program. According to an interview with Scott Semple, a former Commissioner of the Connecticut Department of Corrections, over 100 staff members applied to work on the T.R.U.E. unit. 
Instead of sending someone to solitary confinement or taking away their commissary access, correctional officers who notice that a participant has violated a rule will bring this to the mentors. Often, there will be a group discussion between participants about how to address the violation and what consequence the person should have, which might include extra chores or paying a fine.
The impact of the T.R.U.E. program is evident. Only 21% of mentees have returned to prison,which is a steep drop from the state’s general reincarceration rate of 50%. Although the program has been successful since it was founded, Connecticut has not expanded this model to many of its other prisons across the state. Thus far, only one other prison, the York Correctional Institution for women, has adopted a similar program. 
Funding has been a significant barrier that prevents the broader expansion of the T.R.U.E. model. However, investing in expanding the program would lower the overall costs of incarceration considerably. There are significant costs associated with reincarcerating 50% of those released from prison within three years. The Council of State Governments Justice Center calculated that Connecticut spent over $100 million on reincarcerating people in 2022. T.R.U.E. reduces reincarceration from 50% to 20%, and adopting these types of units more widely in the state would help cut the high costs of continually reincarcerating people.
The model of the T.R.U .E. program offers a promising pathway to reduce the issue of recidivism in our state. In an interview, one T.R.U.E. mentor reflected on how he would convince skeptics that this program is worthwhile, saying “I would ask those people in society to please try to walk in someone’s shoes who watched their father get killed, who watched their brother get killed, who watched their mother do drugs. And think, what type of person would that child grow up to be?” He emphasized the T.R.U.E. program’s focus on accountability and discipline, saying “I’m not asking you to start paying taxpayer dollars to give people the world. Let them earn it. But see if it [programs like T.R.U.E.] works. We’ve tried everything else, haven’t we?”

Piscitelli,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/08/we-must-reclaim-the-values-of-the-greatest-generation/,Immigrants have always been part of America's renewal. To vilify them is to forget our own origin story.,"When we encounter challenging periods in the nation, we often refer to the Greatest Generation. Coined by Tom Brokaw, the “Greatest Generation,” is defined by those who survived the Great Depression, defeated fascism overseas, and went on to build a stable and prosperous country. 
Yet for all our references to their sacrifice and character, we have forgotten many of the values that made their era one of resilience and unity rather than division. Today, our politics are more toxic. As immigrant communities are increasingly targeted by a heartless administration, we would do well to remember the lessons of the Greatest Generation.
They faced hardship together rather than targeting the easiest group to blame. Their instinct was not to divide but to organize. On the other hand, the political rhetoric of the current administration, especially when they label immigrants as unwelcomed or existential threats, runs counter to the spirit of the ideals we held sacred. Fear-based messaging may win short-term political points, but it erodes the long-term cohesion a democracy needs to thrive.
America in the 1940s and 50’s was far from perfect; far from inclusive, yet they still recognized that strength came from a sense of something larger than themselves. Our ancestors fought alongside immigrants and the children of immigrants. They believed in building a country expansive enough to hold many identities. Today, we should be expanding that tradition, not shrinking it through suspicion, fear, and resentment.
Members of the Greatest Generation didn’t pretend to agree on everything. They had political divisions, but they placed civic responsibility above political tribalism. They accepted that this country is a work in progress, renewed by each generation’s willingness to improve it. Immigrants have always been part of that renewal. To vilify them is to forget our own origin story.
My grandfather, the son of Italian immigrants, served with the 12th Armored Division, 17th Armored Infantry Battalion, Company C in the European Theater. He was awarded the Purple Heart for giving his life to defeat fascism and to defend freedom. To truly honor the nearly 407,000 Americans who gave their lives in World War II, the more than 16 million who served, including over 350,000 women in uniform, and the six million-plus women who powered the nation’s workforce, we must reclaim the values they embodied: courage without cruelty, patriotism without exclusion, and determination without resentment.
Compare that with today’s climate, where partisan loyalty often triumphs over the common good, and where inflammatory narratives, often directed at the most vulnerable, replace honest policy debate. We cannot solve real problems with an administration preoccupied with imaginary enemies. We must reject politics that thrive on fear; whether aimed at immigrants, political opponents, or our own neighbors, and choosing instead to build a country as confident and generous as the one our parents, grandparents and great grandparents imagined.
In Truman’s broadcast to the Armed Forces on April 17, 1945, he said: “Our debt to the heroic men and valiant women in the service of our country can never be repaid. They have earned our undying gratitude. America will never forget their sacrifices. Because of these sacrifices, the dawn of justice and freedom throughout the world slowly casts its gleam across the horizon.”
When you look to the horizon, remember what the greatest bestowed upon us: a nation survives not by hardening its heart, but by widening its circle. That is the America they fought for. It can still be the America we build if we so choose.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)The deadly shooting of a Minneapolis woman by an ICE officer Wednesday is the ninth shooting by an immigration officer in just the past fourth months, and all of them involved firing at people in vehicles, according to a New York Times report. 
Video of the incident shared with the Reformer shows masked ICE officers approaching a Honda Pilot stopped in the middle of Portland Avenue near 34th Street. One officer tells the driver, 37-year-old Renee Good, to “get out of the f*cking car” and tries to open the door. Good then slowly backs up and then pulls forward, appearing to try to leave. An officer at the front of the vehicle fires three shots and the SUV travels a short distance before crashing into a parked car.
The deadly incident comes just days after the Trump administration began a massive deployment of 2,000 immigration enforcement officers to Minnesota, ramping up an immigration crackdown that has already caused massive disturbances in Minnesota’s immigrant communities — including the Somali Minnesotan community that is almost entirely citizens and legal residents.
In each of the recent ICE shootings, the government has claimed the officer was acting in self-defense.
Other reporting shows, however, that law enforcement experts have long warned against shooting into cars, and most of the nation’s major cities have banned the practice.

The budget is expected to be a challenge for behavioral health advocates again this year. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)Behavioral health advocates have ambitious priorities for the 2026 General Assembly that include improving the major shortage of behavioral health professionals, advocating for affordable housing options and protecting funds that support the behavioral health network.
But pushing those priorities may be a challenge as legislators grapple with a projected $1.6 billion budget deficit, with higher-than-anticipated use of behavioral health services under Medicaid considered a key driver in the shortfall, according to state analysts.
“That will be key during session, and central to any policy considerations, especially as we’re thinking about asking for increases. Especially as we’re looking at new initiatives,” Adrienne Breidenstine with the Behavioral Health System Baltimore said during a virtual discussion Wednesday.
“This budget gap means that were going to have to be navigating that,” she said.
In November, state analysts told lawmakers that the fiscal outlook for the upcoming fiscal 2027 fiscal year was “quite a bit worse” than what was predicted at the end of the previous legislative session. That’s partially because of funding changes from the Trump administration and the budget reconciliation bill HR 1, known as the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.”
Lawmakers cautioned on use of reserves to solve nearly $1.5 billion deficit

But another reason is that the state has spent about $778 million more than analysts forecast over the current fiscal year, with Medicaid behavioral health services contributing $217 million of that overspending.
In November, Department of Legislative Services Budget Analyst David Romans highlighted Medicaid spending on behavioral health as one of the “big items” contributing to higher-than-anticipated spending over fiscal 2026.
“We’ve seen over the last couple of years a fairly dramatic jump in utilization of behavioral health services by adults enrolled in Medicaid,” he said during a virtual Joint Spending Affordability Committee hearing in November. “I don’t know if we have a complete answer as to why that is.”
But Breidenstine stressed that overspending is “not necessarily a bad thing,” since it means that people who need behavioral health resources are getting them.
“There was a larger than anticipated services utilization of Medicaid services,” she said Wednesday. “Not necessarily a bad thing — it shows that people need care and they’re getting access. It just means that the state didn’t anticipate all of that need.”
In the 2025 session, Gov. Wes Moore (D) proposed cutting around $116 million from various behavioral health programs as the state worked to close a $3 billion budget shortfall it faced then. Advocates like Breidenstine mobilized against those cuts, and lawmakers were able to restore most of that funding.
But solving the upcoming budget deficit will be a key challenge for the 2026 General Assembly session that starts next week, aggravated by the fact that it’s an election year and there is little appetite for raising taxes. Several officials have said the budget may require tightening spending on state programs.
Meanwhile, advocates still want to push other initiatives during the upcoming session that they say are crucial in helping people get behavioral health services they need, which could require additional state funds to accomplish.
Dan Rabbitt of Behavioral Health System Baltimore said one of the organization’s newest priorities is to push for affordable housing options, especially as the Trump administration pulls federal funding to support what’s called permanent supportive housing.
Housing officials, advocates warn shift in HUD funding could unhouse thousands in Maryland

“We’ve also seen a lot of threats coming in from the federal government around permanent supportive housing,” he said. “The current federal administration doesn’t seem to believe in that model. And so, increasing and protecting affordable housing is going to be a priority of ours in the next two years.”
People facing chronic homelessness often struggle with mental health needs and drug addiction. Advocates say that permanent housing programs may address those challenges by pairing housing assistance with connections to mental health services and other resources.
Rabbitt also said that advocates will be pushing lawmakers to help solve the 34,000 behavioral health professional shortage in the state, which is forecasted to only get worse if no action is taken, according to a 2023 report. Ideally, that would involve improving reimbursement rates for providers of mental and behavioral health services, which would require additional state funds.
But advocates are not deterred by those challenges, and hope to work with lawmakers to boost behavioral health services during the 2026 session.
“We advocates have been here before, we know what’s ahead of us to work together to address these issues,” Breidenstine said.

No additional information was provided on the fatal pediatric case, including the date of death, the location or age of the child. Louisiana has reported five deaths related to the flu for the 2025-26 season, with the previous four cases involving adults. 
Louisiana is among 48 states with levels of flu cases the CDC has deemed “very high.” For the current flu season, the agency has estimates there have been 11 million flu cases, 120,000 related hospitalizations and 5,000 deaths attributed to the virus. 
Though the seasonal flu vaccine has turned out to be a poor match for the current prevalent influenza strain, A(H3N2), physicians still recommend obtaining the shot because it can reduce symptoms for those who contract the virus.
For the past two years, former state surgeon general Dr. Ralph Abraham has declined to promote the flu vaccine in Louisiana or have the state health department host events where the vaccine is made available. Abraham now holds the No. 2 position at the Centers for Disease Control.
Abraham followed the lead of U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in crafting policy that requires patients to consult with a doctor before receiving the flu vaccine, moving away from having the shots readily available at health clinics and pharmacies. 
“Maybe that’s a better thing,” Kennedy told CBS News in an interview Wednesday when told fewer people are likely to receive a flu vaccine. He cited research that claims the flu vaccine hasn’t prevented serious illness among children. 
Earlier this week, the Centers for Disease Control removed the vaccines for flu, COVID, rotavirus, meningitis, and hepatitis A and B from the recommended vaccination schedule for children. However, the CDC recommends that 6 months and older get an annual flu vaccine in its weekly flu surveillance update.
Flu cases have historically increased in the early weeks of winter following the holiday season, and CDC data show that trend holding firm to start 2026. National numbers for the final week of December showed patients ages 5 to 17 accounted for the largest share of emergency department flu diagnoses at 21%, followed by newborns to 4-year-olds at 18%. Case numbers were on the rise across all age ranges. 
More than 7% of roughly 3,500 emergency room visits in Louisiana for the week ending Dec. 13 were related to the flu, according to state health department data. Children ages 5 to 11 accounted for nearly 25% of those visits, followed by 2- to 4-year-olds (23%), ages 12 to 17 (15%), newborn  to 1-year-olds (15%), adults 18 to 64 (5%) and patients 65 and older (2%).
Flu vaccine rates generally are highest among senior citizens, followed by younger adults.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)To get in top shape for the 2034 Winter Games, state officials say the drying Great Salt Lake needs enough additional water each year to fill 400,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools – about one for every household in Salt Lake County. 
They acknowledge the goal is ambitious and say they hope to seize on greater public awareness and a mix of government and outside investment to help restore the lake. 



This article is published through the Great Salt Lake Collaborative, a solutions journalism initiative that partners news, education and media organizations to help inform people about the plight of the Great Salt Lake — and what can be done to make a difference before it is too late.


“Yes, our choices do matter when it comes to this lake, and those choices can actually increase recovery, and the speed of recovery,” Brian Steed, Utah’s Great Salt Lake commissioner, said Wednesday at an event focused on the lake’s long-term health and hosted by the University of Utah’s Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute. 
Steed and other members of the state’s “Great Salt Lake strike team” — a group of experts, state officials and others — released a report Wednesday highlighting recent milestones, data on water use and measures that may help. 
The lake has shrunk after years of drought, climate change and redirection of water for farming and other uses, reaching a record low in 2022. It made some recovery before dropping back down to end 2025 at its third-lowest level since 1903. Agriculture is the biggest consumer of water from the Great Salt Lake Basin, at 65%, the report says, followed by municipal and industrial uses at 26.8% and mineral extraction at 5.7%. 
The planned 2034 Olympics in Salt Lake City will draw greater attention to the lake’s health, noted Natalie Gochnour, director of the Gardner Institute. 
“We know that in 2034, the world’s eyes are going to be on this state. And we’ve made this commitment, we’ve signed this charter for the lake, to commit ourselves to be the place that rescues an inland sea,” Gochnour said. 
The state is receiving outside help to recover the lake, with $50 million from the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, which manages water in the West, $100 million from conservation nonprofit Ducks Unlimited, and another commitment for $100 million from a philanthropic campaign, Great Salt Lake Rising, the report notes. 
Timothy Hawkes with the Great Salt Lake Brine Shrimp Cooperative told Utah News Dispatch he felt encouraged by the increase in funding and public awareness. But he said a key question remains: “How are you actually going to get that much water to the lake?”
Hawkes said the process to answer that question “is complicated, it’s difficult, it’s slow, and that’s frustrating for advocates and everybody that cares about the lake.”

Kevin Perry, a professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Utah, said the state is installing more air quality monitors and has a new plan to track how frequent, severe and harmful dust storms are when they kick up toxins from the dry lakebed.  
“I was super excited about this, because this is the first time that the state has really taken the dust issue seriously,” said Perry, a member of the strike team. 
The team’s new report points to successes. Conservation measures over the last 25 years have increased annual average inflow to the lake by 1,665 acre feet — or more than 830 Olympic pools. 
That number is significant, and likely to grow, said Anna McEntire, managing director of Utah State University’s Janet Quinney Lawson Institute for Land, Water and Air. 
“I’m really confident this is a case of increasing returns,” McEntire told Utah News Dispatch. 
In terms of household water use, the vast majority goes outside to lawns and gardens, rather than inside for cooking and showering. The data shows that reducing overall outside use could go far in conserving more water, McEntire said. 
Joel Ferry, executive director of the Utah Department of Natural Resources, called 2026 a “watershed year.” He said he’s working with lawmakers and the Utah Department of Agriculture and Food to improve and expand a program that has begun paying farmers for water they don’t use when they fallow their fields for a time. 
“We’re going to see big movement on water use,” Ferry promised during a panel discussion at Wednesday’s event.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Thousands of people on Wednesday evening filled Portland Avenue near 34th Street in south Minneapolis, where just hours earlier an ICE officer shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good in her car.   
Candles, flowers and whistles filled the patch of snow where Good’s car crashed after she was shot. 
Good’s death has already become a rallying cry for the people working to disrupt President Donald Trump’s mass deportation campaign, which entails heavily armed, masked federal officers roaming the streets of select cities, including Minneapolis, Los Angeles, Chicago,  New Orleans and Memphis, Tennessee.
“No Trump, no troops, Twin Cities ain’t licking boots,” the crowd chanted. Several speakers called for the prosecution of the agent who shot Good.
Carly Morford, of northeast Minneapolis, said she was moved to come to the vigil after seeing a video of the killing and was appalled the Trump administration labeled Good a “domestic terrorist.”
“I’m not going to sit by while my fellow Minnesotans are shot and killed,” Morford said. “And so even though I’m just one person and it’s not going to do anything, a bunch of people coming out is.”

The killing has also reopened wounds from the 2020 Minneapolis police murder of George Floyd less than a mile away, which ignited widespread protests and riots in the city at the time, and a national reckoning over racism and police violence.
Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a press conference Wednesday that Good “weaponized her vehicle” and “attempted to run a law enforcement officer over.”
Video provided to the Reformer shows an officer positioning himself in front of the vehicle and firing three shots through the windshield as Good attempted to turn the car away from the officer.

“For them to sit there and lie, and try to paint a false narrative about Renee, is exactly what they have done for police abuse victims year after year after year,” said attorney and civil rights activist Nekima Levy Armstrong. 
Dani Replogle handed out fliers with information on joining an ICE watch group called Defend 612, which coordinates patrols of city neighborhoods and conducts trainings on observing enforcement actions. 
She said she’s been patrolling the Powderhorn Park area where she lives for about a month and a half. She saw a raid during which a person was handcuffed and people showed up to record and provide advice. 
“That person didn’t end up being abducted that day,” Replogle said. “It was really moving.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/MG_0473-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-07 21:57:56.281229

(Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — As Nebraska lawmakers consider possibly expelling a fellow lawmaker for the first time in state history, senators introduced more than 100 bills Wednesday, the first day of the 2026 legislative session.
The session will primarily focus on closing the state’s $471 million budget deficit, to which Gov. Jim Pillen will soon propose his answer. For now, lawmakers are introducing bills on different priorities, ranging from McCook and its new U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center for migrants to gender transition care, youth sports and new license plates.


Jan. 7, 2026, introduced bills
See the full list of legislation introduced Wednesday.


Legislative Bill 752, introduced by State Sen. Ashlei Spivey of Omaha, is an effort to ensure that state funding continues for reentry and reintegration programming for Nebraska inmates, despite the closure of the McCook Work Ethic Camp.
Under the Pillen administration’s direction, the Work Ethic Camp was recently converted to a holding facility for ICE. Inmates who had been in McCook before the conversion were relocated to other state prison facilities, paroled or released.

In the facility’s former life as a state prison, it had specialized in preparing low-risk male inmates for transition back to the community.
Spivey’s proposal calls for the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services to make sure that mission continues for the relocated inmates and others, directing $5 million in general funds for fiscal year 2026-27 toward tuition, fees and other direct costs for reentry and reintegration programming for committed offenders.
“It’s a way to ensure that programming doesn’t get cut and that we’re still offering those services, because those men still need them,” Spivey said Tuesday.
The feds now reimburse the state for use of the McCook property, which remains owned and staffed by the state. Pillen’s team has estimated the state-federal deal will net Nebraska $14.25 million. The Work Ethic Camp previously cost about $10.2 million in taxpayer dollars each year to operate.

State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of Omaha, as promised, again seeks to define school and state agency restrooms as “male” or “female,” based on 2025 definitions Kauth put in state law. The new bill, LB 730, is identical to the half of Kauth’s 2025 law that she had to carve out to unify her Republican colleagues and pass it with the minimum support needed to overcome a filibuster.
The legislation includes some exceptions, such as for emergencies, cleaning or for parents or caregivers of children or individuals with a disability of different sexes. Single-occupancy bathrooms would be allowed. Schools or universities would decide how to enforce the measure.
Last year, lawmakers also restricted student-athletes in K-12 schools and colleges to interscholastic sports matching their sex at birth, unless coed.
State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston, who supported Kauth’s narrowed 2025 bill but refused to back the bathroom changes, refused to endorse what he termed the “Nebraska State Potty Patrol.” Riepe, a former hospital administrator, reiterated Wednesday that he still worries about enforcement.
Kauth said she reached out to Riepe to address his concerns, including those he voiced on a radio show in November. She said he did not return her call. Riepe said Wednesday he remains opposed, jeopardizing Kauth’s path to 33 votes.
“If you can’t enforce it, you better get it off the books, or it’ll come back and bite you legally someplace,” Riepe said.

Kauth this year also seeks to fully outlaw prescribing cross-sex hormones or puberty blockers to youths experiencing gender dysphoria beginning next year, via LB 732. The bill would also prohibit gender care for Nebraska minors via out-of-state telehealth.
The Nebraska Attorney General’s Office would be empowered to enforce the act within 20 years of a violation. That would include each prescription of puberty blockers or hormones for gender transition.
A 2023 Kauth bill strictly regulated the medicine for transgender youths, as dictated by the state’s chief medical officer. It banned gender transition surgeries in the state.
LB 731, also from Kauth, would expand the window in which Nebraskans who are recommended or prescribed gender transition care but want to later sue for injury or damages to within 12 years after the last date of care.
“As the adults, we are supposed to help kids with what they need and help them through whatever difficulties they’re having, but that does not mean cutting of their body parts or putting completely altering drugs in their systems,” Kauth said.
Riepe said he would need to review the new bills but that he’s a bit “live and let live.”
“I can’t live somebody else’s life, and, quite frankly, it’s above my pay grade, by a long ways,” Riepe said. “I’m not really enthusiastic about trying to make life more difficult for any group of people.”

Michelle Jud, a founder of the nonprofit Rainbow Parents of Nebraska, a group of parents statewide whose children are LGBTQ, said parents have become “numb” to the repeated fights. She said advocates had expected the bathroom bill to be reintroduced but not the others.
“Once you’ve been stabbed in the back, it’s like twisting the knife,” Jud said. “Let’s just see what more harmful things we can do.”
Jud asked why politicians think they can better handle their children’s needs than their counselors, doctors or parents. She said Rainbow Parents see their kids as a “gift.”
“We just wish that everybody could see that they’re more than just a trans person,” Jud said. “They’re not just a demographic to come after. They’re human beings with amazing talents and perspectives.”
Separately, State Sen. Terrell McKinney of North Omaha introduced LB 742, which seeks to allow certain seventh and eighth-graders to participate in high school sports with the sign-off of the appropriate coach or athletic director, health care professional and parent.
McKinney said it’s important for youth development and a shift in the view of Nebraska athletes.
“I think it starts with developing them at a younger age and making sure they are prepared, so we start seeing in-state kids going to our state schools,” McKinney said.
Among other notable proposals introduced Wednesday:

LB 733, by State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston — Change the name of the Division of Developmental Disabilities in the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services to the Division of Disability and Aging within DHHS.
LB 738, by State Sen. Victor Rountree of Bellevue, and LB 769, by State Sen. Barry DeKay of Niobrara — Establish new custom license plates honoring women veterans (LB 738) and the University of Nebraska State Museum (LB 769).
LB 745, by State Sen. Margo Juarez of Omaha — Eliminate certain requirements for obtaining a diploma of high school equivalency, including that the individual must be at least 18, and have withdrawn from school for at least one year.
LB 751, by State Sen. Ashlei Spivey of Omaha — Require the Nebraska State Patrol, in partnership with the Commission on African American Affairs, to conduct a study on missing Black women and children in the state. The findings could lead to legislation and state resources to improve reporting and identification of those missing. 
LB 762, by State Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln; LB 780, by Dungan; and LB 805, by State Sen. Dan Lonowski of Hastings — Require insurance coverage for pediatric autoimmune disorders (LB 762), eating disorders (LB 780) and infant cranial helmets (LB 805). 
LB 734, by State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha — Restore previous work requirement exemptions for recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps. Nebraska changed its requirements after Congress passed the federal tax and spending law President Donald Trump sought.
LB 791, by State Sen. Jane Raybould of Lincoln — Restrict annual campaign contributions to candidates or ballot measures to no more than $3,500, beginning Jan. 1, 2027. The rate would be adjusted for inflation every two years.
LB 809, by State Sen. Rob Dover of Norfolk — Prevent cities and political subdivisions from passing local laws that prohibit landlords from refusing to rent a privately-owned home based on the applicant’s source of income, including government assistance.
LB812, by State Sen. Eliot Bostar of Lincoln — Set state requirements for DHHS regarding Medicaid eligibility redeterminations and community engagement to match more lenient federal standards.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Arden Barnes) FRANKFORT — Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear gave his annual State of the Commonwealth address Wednesday evening, but Republican lawmakers largely weren’t there to hear it. 
In his seventh annual address and final budget proposal, Beshear urged Kentuckians and Americans to keep faith in the American Dream even as he said Republican President Donald Trump’s policies make it seem unattainable. 
“Today, too many American families feel this dream is just a hallucination. The costs of groceries and health care are too high. The family vacation they took as kids just doesn’t fit in the budget,” Beshear said. “That first home for a young couple is simply unaffordable – maybe unattainable. As leaders, we have a responsibility to reignite and refuel the American Dream. For the sake of future generations, it must burn bright in the minds of our people.” 
The governor’s address is typically given to a joint session of the General Assembly in the House chambers, but the Capitol is closed amid a multi-year renovation. Lawmakers began meeting in temporary chambers with limited public access this week as they begin a 60-day session which will decide the next two-year state budget.

Beshear, seen by some as a possible candidate for president in 2028, recalled words by LaRue County-born President Abraham Lincoln in his first inaugural address: “We are not enemies, but friends. … Though passion may have strained it must not break our bonds of affection.”
“While the national media fixates on the rage, we focus on results. While social media lifts up the angry and judgmental, we must amplify kindness, acceptance and empathy,” Beshear told the crowd. “This polarized moment in our history won’t last forever. And, like Lincoln all those years ago, Kentucky can lead the way out of the darkness and into the light. It’s our job. It’s our duty. And we cannot leave a broken country to our children.”

Secretary of State Michael Adams was the lone GOP constitutional officer in the crowd. Speaking to reporters, Adams noted that the governor and the other officers have been sparring over executive branch budget cuts the governor has requested to cover revenue shortfalls in the current fiscal year.
“He’s an excellent speaker,” Adams said of Beshear. “Obviously, this speech was more about 2028 than 2026, but I respect that.”
The General Assembly’s top two Republicans — House Speaker David Osborne and Senate President Robert Stivers — told reporters Wednesday afternoon before the 5:30 p.m. speech that they planned to not attend. 
“I’ll be in my office, watching it on TV,” Osborne said, adding that the address wouldn’t be given in the House chambers, but instead across town at the Kentucky Historical Society’s Thomas D. Clark Center. 
Osborne added that “because of the access issues and the limited number of people that we can accommodate in the temporary space, (Beshear) elected to do it over there.” He later added that the speech would be “poised as a budget address, but we know its political theater.” 
Scottie Ellis, spokesperson for Beshear, told the Lantern that the Beshear administration had spoken to legislative leadership “about where to hold the State of the Commonwealth Address, and it was recommended we plan an alternate location noting that the temporary chambers – designed by the LRC – do not have any form of seating for guests or media.”
“The Thomas D. Clark Center for Kentucky History was selected based on its proximity to the Capitol and so that more people can attend,” she said. 
Osborne called it a “new version of normal in these temporary facilities.”
“Certainly, he could have done it here, but he chose not to, and so it will have the same impact,” he continued. “Hopefully, we will finally get to at least see some of the numbers that we’ve been asking for for months that have not been given to us.” 
In recent years, House Republicans have issued their budget ahead of Beshear’s proposals. However, it’s unlikely budget bills will be filed this week, Osborne said, as House members “haven’t gotten all the information that we needed despite multiple requests” made to the Beshear administration.

While it’s a tradition for Kentucky governors to deliver State of the Commonwealth addresses to joint sessions of the House and Senate, the Kentucky Constitution requires only that governors “from time to time, give to the General Assembly information of the state of the Commonwealth” and recommendations on expenditures.
‘American Dream’
In his address, Beshear reiterated budget proposals that he had discussed in an embargoed briefing with reporters earlier Wednesday. Among them, he is asking the GOP-controlled General Assembly to approve $500 million in one-time spending to ease families’ “rising cost pressures.” 
Beshear was critical of Trump’s policies, particularly the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, or as the governor calls it, the “big, ugly bill. Beshear raised concerns about the legislation’s cuts to Medicaid and how it will impact Kentuckians who rely on the assistance program. Beshear said the law could close 35 rural Kentucky hospitals and eliminate coverage for 200,000 Kentuckians. 
The governor’s budget proposal calls for more money for health care access statewide, including $100 million to lower the cost of coverage on kynect, Kentucky’s Affordable Care Act health insurance exchange, and a $125 million rural hospital fund.

“The combination of these federal failures threatens the American Dream with lost jobs, higher costs, shorter lives and longer drives just to see the same doctor,” Beshear said. That’s why my budget pushes back, investing in our people and our health care. My budget fully funds Medicaid, even with the increasing cost.” 
Beshear defined the American Dream, a theme he revisited throughout the speech, as “ if you work hard and play by the rules, you can get ahead. You can build a better life. You can leave your kids better off.”

Beshear said his family has lived the American Dream, as his grandfather could not afford to go to college, but saved money and ultimately bought a local funeral home and supported his kids through college, including former Gov. Steve Beshear, the current governor’s father. 
The governor said several guests at the event embody the American Dream, including representatives from GE Appliances, which announced a multi-million dollar business investment in Kentucky last year, and General Matter, which leased federal land in Paducah for a new uranium enrichment facility. Throughout his speech, Beshear heralded economic development in the state during his time in office. 
Beshear named other guests in the crowd, like Dr. Jason Smith, the CEO of UofL Health, and added he hoped Smith would see the governor’s budget “as a reflection that Kentucky believes in you and we believe in health care for all of our people.” 
Toward the end of the speech, Beshear spoke about what he views as the most important choice for lawmakers this legislative session: funding for universal preschool statewide. Beshear has led a coalition to garner support for what he calls “Pre-K for All” leading up to the session. 
“To members of the General Assembly: We were able to work together on medical marijuana, to make sports betting legal, to protect horse racing and gaming and our horse industry,” Beshear said. “Surely, we can come together for 4-year-olds.” 
Beshear also had a message for those who want to make universal pre-K political. 
“Let me remind you: 4-year-olds can’t vote. They aren’t registered,” he said. “So if you’re against this because you think it gives me a win, what you’re really doing is handing these kids a loss.” 
Stivers and Osborne have typically held a joint press conference before or after the governor’s speech. This year, they opted to issue a statement after the speech, saying that the remarks were received and they were “hopeful they will include the data and information we have requested of his administration for the last several months.” 
“Kentucky is well positioned because of the sound, fiscally responsible policies enacted by Republican supermajorities — often overriding gubernatorial vetoes to do so,” the GOP leaders said. “These policies have produced a record budget reserve trust fund and allowed us to responsibly lower the state income tax. Our legislative focus will remain on protecting core investments, ensuring responsible stewardship of taxpayer dollars, and avoiding commitments the Commonwealth cannot sustain. We will continue to prioritize measured growth, accountability, and long-term stability.”

While most Republican lawmakers stayed away from the speech Wednesday, some were among the crowd. 
Sen. Phillip Wheeler, R-Pikeville, told reporters after the speech that Trump’s tariffs led to some of the economic developments Beshear touted, like Apple’s expansion of a glass manufacturing facility in Harrodsburg. Wheeler added that lawmakers should make sure rural hospitals are stable and have the ability to support their communities, and that would likely come up as lawmakers continue their budget session. 
As for universal pre-K, Wheeler did not think lawmakers would act on the governor’s request. 
“While I don’t think it’s a bad thing by any measure, clearly the cost has to be weighed with the benefit, and I don’t think that the benefit of that is probably something you won’t see the General Assembly act on this session,” Wheeler said.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/260107SOTC708-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-07 20:57:20.185358

Joe Lombardo discussing housing ""attainability"" legislation in April. (Photo: April Corbin Girnus/Nevada Current)Legislative efforts to rein in corporate investors from purchasing excessive amounts of single family homes across Nevada has been consistently blocked by Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo. 
Republican President Donald Trump announced Wednesday he wants to see the industry regulated at the federal level, in an effort to tackle the housing and affordability crisis. 
“I am immediately taking steps to ban large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes, and I will be calling on Congress to codify it,” Trump wrote in a social media post Wednesday. “People live in homes, not corporations.”
Lombardo’s office didn’t respond to questions about the governor’s reaction to Trump’s announcement.
But in a statement issued late Wednesday, Lombardo said “while President Trump works to address corporate homeownership issues at the federal level, my administration continues to work on this complex issue at the state level.”
“Following the end of the 36th Special Session here in Nevada, we have been actively developing an interim stakeholder working group to develop a complete understanding of the issues surrounding corporate homeownership, and we’re working to identify consensus solutions we can quickly deploy in state to lower the cost of housing in Nevada.”
The existence of the “working group” had not been publicly announced prior to Trump’s social media post Wednesday.
Democratic state Sen. Dina Neal, who has backed bills in previous sessions to crack down on corporate homeownership, said in an email this was the first she had heard of Lombardo’s working group.
Neal while she disagreed with Trump on numerous issues, she was “happy that, on this single issue, he has reluctantly recognized the importance of homeownership.”
However, she would be “cautious about anything that is implemented by this administration regarding fairness and Americans’ well-being.”
She also decried previous efforts to stymie state action to regulate the industry. 
“I introduced a bill to curb the sale of homes to hedge funds and other corporate entities in the 2023 and 2025 sessions, and fought to include it in the most recent special session, but Gov. Lombardo has stopped my efforts every time,” she said. “Corporate greed has hollowed out our communities, putting the American dream out of reach for everyday Nevadans, and I hope that, with the President’s support, Gov. Lombardo will finally agree to put Nevadans first.” 
Democratic Attorney General Aaron Ford, who is running for governor, said in a statement that Trump’s announcement to crack down on corporate homeownership puts Lombardo at odds with the administration. 
Ford added that Lombardo has been the state’s “biggest roadblock to affordable housing.” 
“He vetoed and blocked similar plans to stop Wall Street firms from controlling our housing stock before refusing to include similar legislation in his special session proclamation,” Ford said.
“Joe Lombardo is now even more extreme than Donald Trump when it comes to helping families afford to buy a home,” said Hillary Barrett, executive director of the Nevada State Democratic Party. “As Nevadans struggle with housing costs, Lombardo has consistently fought to protect the profits of his Wall Street backers by blocking efforts to limit their ability to price people out of the housing market.” 
Housing organizers and legal aid groups have long warned about the rise of corporate entities purchasing large portions of housing stock amid a growing shortage of affordable and available housing. 
An analysis by Stateline found that nearly a quarter of all single-family homes sold in 2021 had been purchased by investors. In Nevada, the same analysis found, the share of investor purchases increased from 18% to 30% from 2020 to 2021.
The Lied Center for Real Estate at the University of Nevada Las Vegas estimated investors owned roughly 15% of homes in the City of Las Vegas. That percentage was expected to grow both in Nevada and across the nation.
Efforts to regulate the industry have repeatedly failed at the state Legislature. 
Neal introduced Senate Bill 395 in the 2023 session that sought to limit corporate investment to 1,000 housing units per year. 
The legislation passed in a mostly party line vote with Republican state Sen. Ira Hansen of Sparks joining Democrats. 
But the bill was vetoed by Lombardo, who wrote in veto message the bill would “arbitrarily limit the number of units a residential property lessor may acquire in one year.” 
“This bill would remove millions of dollars in commerce tax revenue from businesses engaged in the sale of real estate, detrimentally affect blue-collar trades by decreasing demand for new construction, and chill interest from Nevadan lessors during a period when renters are in desperate need of greater residential availability,” the governor wrote in his veto message.
Neal revived the failed bill in the 2025 regular session, this time reducing the number of homes corporate investors could purchase annually from 1,000 to 100.
The legislation needed to secure a two-thirds majority to pass since it imposed fees. Hansen voted against the bill, adding he was doing so “very reluctantly.” 
“For the first time this session, I have actually been asked by the executive branch to support a caucus ‘no’ position, which I have agreed to do,” Hansen said in a floor speech in May voting against the bill.
An effort to yet again rein in corporate investors was revived during the recent special session in November after Hansen, along with Assemblymember Alexis Hansen, his wife, signed a petition to have the bill considered. 
When a governor calls a special session in Nevada, lawmakers are limited to the topics included within the official proclamation. But legislators also have the ability to call themselves into a special session, if two-thirds of the members in both houses agree to it.
The legislation proposed a 1,000-unit cap on the total aggregate number of homes that could be purchased in a year by private investors. The Nevada Secretary of State’s Office would help monitor a new corporate homeowner registry and determine when the 1,000-unit limit was reached.
Despite supporting the petition to bring the topic to the special session, Alexis Hansen cast the deciding ‘no’ vote that killed the corporate home ownership bill.
In a social media post following Trump’s announcement Wednesday, Ira Hansen wrote he “couldn’t be more pleased with this action.” 
Neal is expected to once again bring back legislation to crack down on corporate ownership during the 2027 legislative session.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/PXL_20250401_202855196-1024x731.jpg,,,2026-01-07 20:57:20.185358

Tim Walz speaks at the State Emergency Operations Center in Blaine, MN after a woman is killed by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in Minneapolis on Wednesday Jan. 7, 2025. (Photo by Alyssa Chen/Minnesota Reformer)Gov. Tim Walz issued an order for the Minnesota National Guard to prepare to be deployed if necessary following the killing of a 37-year-old woman by a federal immigration agent Wednesday.
Dozens of members of the State Patrol’s response team have also been activated to respond to possible unrest, Walz said at a news conference at the State Emergency Operations Center.
Walz’s quick action is no doubt informed by his response to the uprising following the police murder of George Floyd in 2020, when critics said he was slow to marshal the state’s resources to restore order amid burning and looting, including of a Minneapolis police precinct.
An ICE officer fatally shot Renee Nicole Good, 37,  through her car window in south Minneapolis. Videos of the Wednesday incident show the woman beginning to drive away from the officer as he shot into the car. Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said they have yet to see information indicating that the shooting was justified, though the Trump administration is accusing the deceased driver of “domestic terrorism.”
Walz said at a press conference at the State Emergency Operations Center that his administration “will stop at nothing to seek accountability and justice.” The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension is jointly investigating the killing with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Walz urged the federal government to remove its presence from Minnesota: “To Donald Trump and Kristi Noem, you’ve done enough.”
Walz was asked whether the National Guard would ever be deployed against federal agents. He didn’t answer directly, saying the National Guard’s deployment would be for the protection of Minnesotans: “Whatever it is: if it’s an act of nature, if it’s a global pandemic, or in this case, if it is a rogue federal agent. I don’t know this time.”
Walz is already at the center of an explosive confrontation between state and federal authorities. A bevy of federal agencies are investigating Minnesota social service and other safety net programs for evidence of fraud in the wake of a right wing media frenzy kicked off in November.
Walz announced Monday he was ending his campaign for a third term in the face of withering attacks from the Trump administration and right-wing influencers.
Ready for civil unrest
The State Emergency Operations Center has been activated at level two out of three levels — meaning that state is monitoring the situation —  as when Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark were killed and Sen. John Hoffman and Yvette Hoffman badly injured by a gunman, as well as after the mass shooting at Annunciation Church.
The Minnesota National Guard leadership has connected with Minneapolis and St. Paul Police Departments, the Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office, the Department of Natural Resources and Minnesota’s Homeland Security Emergency Management, Walz said.
The preparation of state and local law enforcement agencies appears to be in anticipation of possible civil unrest, though Walz did not explicitly answer a question about what threshold of demonstrations it would take for him to deploy the Minnesota National Guard.
The shooting has already drawn outrage from thousands of protestors who gathered at the scene of the killing on Portland Avenue near 34th Street Wednesday.
Minnesota Commissioner of Public Safety Bob Jacobson offered examples of what protestors are legally allowed to do: gather peacefully in walking spaces; march or walk, not on roadways; chant and make signs.
He then listed a slew of examples of actions that would result in fines or arrests: demonstrating on freeways on foot; walking on highways; throwing objects; starting fires; damaging or vandalizing property; using illegal fireworks; displaying or using illegal weapons; and reckless or dangerous driving.
“Minnesotans, do not take the bait. Do not allow them to deploy federal troops in the air. Do not allow them to invoke the Insurrection Act. Do not allow them to declare martial law. Do not allow them to lie about the security and the decency of the state. And let this investigation play itself out,” Walz said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0976-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-07 19:58:45.027051

Sam Creekmore, the new chairman of the Mississippi House Public Health and Human Services Committee, speaks during a committee meeting at the State Capitol in Jackson, Miss., Wednesday, Feb. 7, 2024.","The state House Public Health and Human Services Committee approved the same certificate of need bill language from last year’s legislative session Wednesday, minus a provision that led Gov. Tate Reeves to veto the legislation. The bill, which will make it easier for medical facilities to make capital improvements, now goes to the full House for a vote.
The early vote will give the committee an opportunity to propose additional changes later in the session to the law, which requires medical facilities to apply for a “certificate of need” from the Mississippi State Department of Health before opening or adding new medical services, said committee Chairman Rep. Sam Creekmore, a Republican from New Albany, who authored the legislation in both years. 
“The goal was to get it to the governor as quickly as possible,” Creekmore told members of the State Board of Health during a Wednesday meeting following the vote. The group convened separately to consider possible changes to the certificate of need law. “I promised the committee today that there would be more (certificate of need legislation) coming,” he said. 
The bill would make it easier for medical facilities to make improvements to buildings and medical equipment and would require the University of Mississippi Medical Center to seek state approval before opening educational facilities outside a designated area in Jackson. It also directs the health department to study the feasibility of exempting small hospitals from approval requirements for dialysis and geriatric psychiatry services and requiring psychiatric facilities to treat a certain percentage of uninsured patients. 
It nixed a provision to grant a new certificate of need to Oceans Behavioral Hospital Jackson. The language, which was added during last year’s session as an amendment by Public Health and Welfare Chairman Sen. Hob Bryan, a Democrat from Amory, would have ended a legal dispute between Oceans and another local hospital over the amount of free or low-cost care Oceans must provide to patients in need. The addendum led Reeves to veto lawmakers’ certificate of need, or CON, bill.

“The proposed amendment smacks of both imprudent legislative favoritism towards the entity that will receive the CON, as well as bald prejudice to the other market participants,” Reeves wrote in his veto message. “In either case, awarding a CON by legislative fiat is bad public policy.”
Certificate of need law is a familiar target for legislative reform in Mississippi, but few substantial changes have been made to the law since 2016. The law aims to lower costs and improve the quality and accessibility of health care by preventing duplication of services, but stakeholders are divided on whether or not it accomplishes its goals.
Critics argue the law stifles competition and fails to decrease costs. Advocates say it ensures that communities have access to a range of health services, not only those that are profitable. In Mississippi, where more than half of rural hospitals are at risk of closure, some people argue the law harms rural hospitals by restricting the services they are allowed to offer. 
Proposed changes to the law shapeshifted over the course of last year’s session. The Senate removed several key provisions of the bill originally approved by the House of Representatives, including those that would have streamlined the law’s appeals process and freed certain in-demand health care services – including substance use treatment and outpatient hospital dialysis units – from being required to acquire a certificate of need from the state to open.
At Wednesday’s meeting of the Board of Health’s certificate of need subcommittee, members expressed an appetite for reviving some of last year’s proposed changes in its recommendation to the full Board of Health.
The group discussed exempting some services, including substance use treatment and psychiatric services, from being required to acquire a certificate of need from the state to open — recommendations the committee has made in the past. It also suggested excusing small rural hospitals with existing certificates from the requirement to seek approval before adding services or making capital expenditures that exceed statutory limits.

“I think what these rural hospitals need is they need options for cash flow and revenue streams,” said Board of Health Chairman Dr. Lucius Lampton. “…If we don’t let them figure out some new revenue streams, they’re all going to close.”
State Health Officer Dr. Dan Edney said that allowing rural hospitals to add new services helps keep patients in their communities instead of transferring them to distant facilities. 
“When we hear hospitals talk about expanding services, psych and dialysis are the two I hear them talk about most frequently,” he said. 
Dr. Thad Waites, a Hattiesburg cardiologist, said he is concerned that loosening restrictions that allow rural hospitals to open new clinics could scatter medical professionals in already understaffed areas and harm dialysis systems. 
“I fear that we’re going to be breaking something that ain’t broke,” he said.  
The subcommittee unanimously passed the recommendations, which will be refined before being presented to the full Board of Health at its next meeting on Jan. 14. Creekmore said the group’s proposals represent an initial step towards fine-tuning further changes to the state’s certificate of need law.
“I think what you’ve done is great, and that’s enough weight that we can at least get this process started being vetted in the Legislature.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/06073830/3X0A9202-scaled.jpg,,,2026-01-07 19:58:45.027051

The driver died, according to the Department of Homeland Security. (Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)As the Trump administration and its allies in the national Republican Party double down on their belief that an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent acted in self-defense Wednesday when he fatally shot an American woman in Minneapolis, who was observing their activity in the city, Michigan Democrats and Republicans sounded off on the tragedy that has the potential to boil over in the coming days.
Both President Donald Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem called the shooting an act of self-defense. But multiple eyewitnesses and videos taken from several different angles at the scene of the shooting showed conflicting views of the event. That has led to outrage from Democrats and anti-ICE advocates over the agency’s unchecked ability to raid, detain and use deadly force against immigrants, and now American citizens.
One of the key videos being shared was obtained by the Michigan Advance’s sister publication, the Minnesota Reformer.

In Michigan, that same dynamic played out as Democratic and Republican lawmakers and candidates took sides quickly.
Sen. Gary Peters (D-Bloomfield) called the event horrific, and said the Department of Homeland Security’s public statements on the fatal shooting were “not only reckless – they appear to be outright falsehoods. If this Administration can label anyone a domestic terrorist to deflect responsibility, then every American is at risk.”
“Video evidence indicates that this was an unacceptable use of deadly force, and I call on my Republican colleagues to immediately convene public oversight hearings on this and numerous other reports of excessive force, intimidation, and other egregious conduct by federal officers,” Peters wrote on social media. 
Peters also called on Noem and her department to change course, truthfully inform the public, and engage in the appropriate oversight.
“Without this accountability, I am concerned tensions will only continue to escalate,” Peters wrote.
Michigan’s Democratic congressional representatives from Detroit, U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib and U.S. Rep. Shri Thanedar, both decried the killing.
“ICE shot and killed a woman in Minneapolis today while she was trying to drive away from them,” Tlaib said. “Her killer must be held accountable and brought to justice. We need this rogue agency out of our neighborhoods.”
Dems demand investigation of fatal Minneapolis ICE shooting as Trump claims self-defense

Tlaib called to abolish ICE outright. Thanedar called for a full investigation and serious legal restraints on ICE, continuing his legislative push to end qualified immunity for the agency and its agents.
“It’s clear ICE is a group of untrained thugs, and they should not be above the law,” Thanedar said. “I will continue fighting to end qualified immunity to ensure ICE agents are held to the same legal standards as every other American.”
U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham), a candidate for the U.S. Senate, said the shooting death of the woman “unacceptable.”
“There needs to be a thorough and independent investigation into what happened, but what is clear is that the masked, armed, and untrained agents that Trump is lawlessly deploying to our cities are causing more harm, not protecting people,” Stevens said. “We cannot and should not allow the Trump administration to turn our communities into war zones.”
State Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak), also a candidate for the U.S. Senate, said: “There’s no sugarcoating this; the president’s security theater just cost someone their life.”
Abdul El-Sayed, the third candidate in the Democratic U.S. Senate primary race, said the outcome of the shooting was sadly the logical one when the federal government puts “untrained personnel who have been told that they are above the law on peaceful streets.”
“We pray for the victim and her family and we demand an end to lawlessness in the name of the law,” El-Sayed said.
State. Sen. Jeremy Moss (D-Bloomfield Township), a candidate for Michigan’s 11th Congressional District, said the nation “cannot empower masked vigilantes to wreak havoc on civil neighborhoods under the guise of law enforcement.”
“This does not make us safer and today it tragically cost a life in Minnesota,” Moss said. “In Michigan, I’m working to unmask ICE, restore due process, and protect the rights of our immigrant and refugee communities.”

Michigan GOP stands with ICE, Trump and Noem
 U.S. Rep. Lisa McClain (R-Bruce Township), in a series of posts on X, blamed Democrats for ICE’s actions.
“This is what happens when Democrats continue to DEMONIZE LAW ENFORCEMENT,” McClain wrote in one post. “Praying for all our brave ICE agents who are working to keep us safe.”
In another resharing of a statement from Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, who said ICE needed to “get the f*ck out” of his city, McClain called his rhetoric dangerous while also laying no blame for the killing on ICE.
“Why is the socialist mayor of Minneapolis putting a TARGET on the backs of law enforcement?” McClain also wrote, and said the same about Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz asking for any and all protests to remain peaceful as to not agitate an extreme federal response.
State Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt (R-Porter Township), a GOP candidate for governor, in a series X posts, also said he proudly stood with ICE and that the agency was not the problem.
“Trying to run over law enforcement, throwing rocks at them, and trying to impede them from doing their job isn’t “protesting”. It’s domestic terrorism,” Nesbitt wrote in one post. “Praying for the safety of all our ICE agents federal law enforcement.”
Former Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox, another contender in the GOP gubernatorial hunt, said, “supporting illegals, fraudsters and liberal extremism over federal law enforcement officers is something you will NEVER see in Michigan when I’m Governor.”
Cox noted that his wife, former Michigan Republican Party Co-Chair Laura Cox, was an undercover ICE agent for 13 years, where she had carried out “drug raids, and arresting dangerous illegals to protect our Nation. That’s what ICE does EVERY DAY.”
In another post on X resharing Frey’s statements, Cox said: “This guy is aiding and abetting violence and mayhem.”

(Christine Zhu/NC Newsline)North Carolina state House lawmakers were sharply critical Wednesday of DEI programs in Raleigh and Asheville, the latest Democratic-controlled cities to attract the ire of Republican legislative leaders.
The Republican-controlled legislature has passed several measures in the past two years banning “diversion, equity and inclusion” efforts in schools, public universities, and state government, saying they amount to racial preference.
At its meeting Wednesday, the North Carolina House Select Committee on Government Efficiency heard a lengthy presentation by Asheville attorney Ruth Smith, an unsuccessful 2024 legislative candidate, who alleged that Buncombe County and Asheville are using “equity” to allocate resources based on race. Smith says that violates the 14th Amendment, the North Carolina Constitution and federal anti-discrimination laws.
She cited examples including the 2021 Buncombe Racial Equity Plan as well as internships and scholarships that exclude white and Asian students.
Smith pointed to Buncombe County Justice Partners, a summer internship program for high school students in the area. It’s funded by the Buncombe County Bar and city of Asheville. The program exclusively excluded white and Asian students, Smith said, despite using state funds and taking place on state property at the Buncombe County Courthouse.
“I want to say clearly that I am not saying that race is not a problem in America, it’s not a problem in Buncombe County,” Smith said. “What I’m looking at is whether or not the remedies that Buncombe County and the city of Asheville are taking are constitutional or in violation of law.”
She also pointed to the City of Asheville Black Scholarship Fund. This program reallocated $500,000 from a class-action lawsuit over illegal water fees to establish scholarships for high school students and teachers. The funds were provided to a third party, the Asheville Schools Foundation, to administer.
“Every race was excluded, except for Black folks,” she said.
After a lawsuit, the scholarship was redrafted to include all high school students. A scholarship for Black teachers remains, Smith said.
No one representing the local governments of Asheville or Buncombe County offered testimony. It’s unclear whether they were invited to do so.
Rep. Brian Echevarria (R-Cabarrus) asked Smith how the city of Asheville and Buncombe County had justified their efforts.
Smith said they looked at disparities, applying resources based on race and assumptions about advantages.
“Again, I’m not saying that there aren’t disparities and that the goals aren’t what we should be doing, but you can’t discriminate on the basis of race,” she said. “The government cannot do that. It’s well established in the Supreme Court.”
Raleigh Mayor Janet Cowell and City Manager Marchell Adams-David appeared in front of the panel after legislators summoned them to testify due to allegations that the city was still engaging in DEI efforts.
In January 2025, President Donald Trump issued a flurry of executive orders banning DEI in programs that use federal funding. That led to discussions among Raleigh city leaders, who suspended initiatives like equity training and an equity action plan to be in compliance with the orders.
The accusations against the city came about after a conservative activist posed as someone applying for a job within the city and asked about its support for DEI, recording an undercover video.
Cowell said she wasn’t aware of the video until lawmakers asked her to testify.
“We became aware of it when y’all asked us to appear,” she said.
Throughout the year, the city made other changes to meet federal compliance requirements, such as realigning department functions.
Adams-David emphasized that the city of Raleigh does not have quotas — there is no preferential treatment for certain backgrounds.
The city’s inclusion efforts, she said, are focused on economic development, not race. She pointed to a recent small business expo as an example.
“We work really hard to ensure that everybody has an opportunity to thrive,” Adams-David said. “When we make decisions from a fiduciary perspective, it doesn’t matter what race you are, what nationality you are, what religion you participate in or not, and the same thing applies when we make hiring decisions.”
Cowell said the city has other initiatives to help support small businesses as well.
There’s a lot of baby boomers who own businesses and are retiring, she said, so the city is working on helping to educate them on selling their businesses to their employees. “It’s a way to keep those businesses local, keep the wealth local, and do a nice transfer,” Cowell said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_6334-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-07 19:58:45.027051

Gavin Newsom will propose regulating corporate landlords during his State of the State address Thursday, his office said. It’s a pivot toward populism for the governor.","In summary
Gov. Gavin Newsom will propose regulating corporate landlords during his State of the State address Thursday, his office said. It’s a pivot toward populism for the governor.


In his final year in office, Gov. Gavin Newsom plans to go after large investors buying and owning California housing — in the same week that President Donald Trump also took rhetorical aim at Big Landlord.
It’s an unlikely meeting of the minds of two political foes who, in a race to head off the electorate’s concerns about affordability, have landed upon the same populist message: Blame Wall Street.
Newsom plans to say during his State of the State address to lawmakers on Thursday that he wants to work with them to regulate the practice of investors buying up large stocks of housing to rent out, forcing California residents to compete with them to afford buying a home, according to the governor’s office.
Proposals could include “enhanced state oversight and enforcement and potential changes to the state tax code,” according to the governor’s office.
“When housing is treated primarily as a corporate investment strategy, Californians feel the impact,” a source in the office said. “Prices go up, rents rise, and fewer people have a chance to buy a home.”
That sounds similar to a proposal Trump made on his social media platform Truth Social on Wednesday. The two previously closely aligned on policy related to clearing of homeless encampments. 
“I am immediately taking steps to ban large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes,” the president wrote, sending stock prices of major publicly traded residential investment firms plummeting. He urged Congress to put the proposal into law and promised to unveil additional housing policy proposals at the World Economic Forum summit in Davos, Switzerland later this month.
Newsom is stopping short of calling for an outright ban on institutional investors’ ownership, though the source said he will seek to “curb” it with the goal of making home ownership more affordable for California residents. 
He hasn’t yet proposed anything concrete. Whatever Newsom seeks to do, he’ll need the approval of the state Legislature.
Trump, for his part, did not offer any details about his proposal, such as how institutional investors would be defined under the proposed law or why he targeted single-family homes in particular. The White House’s press office did not respond to an email with those questions. 
The twin announcements come after years of long-shot efforts by California progressives to address a surge in companies buying up single-family housing stock in the wake of the Great Recession. The issue has been the subject of renewed anxiety in post-fire Los Angeles, where a recent report by RedFin showed investors (loosely defined as any buyer with a name that includes “LLC,” “Inc” or “Corp”) have purchased 27 of 61 burned vacant lots that sold in Altadena — more than 40%. 
Asked about that report in an interview on MS Now this week, Newsom said he had signed an executive order last year seeking to protect homeowners who find it too expensive to rebuild from falling for “predatory” lowball offers for their properties. But he acknowledged “the broader market conditions are challenging.”
The proposals mark new territory for Newsom’s housing affordability platform. The governor, now in his final year in office, has spent most of the past seven years focused on boosting construction. It’s a pivot toward populism for the governor, who is widely expected to run for president in 2028.
Blaming deep-pocketed investors for the nation’s housing woes has become an increasingly ideological-spanning exercise in recent years, with politicians as diverse as New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Vice President J.D. Vance championing the cause.
Shortly after Trump’s post, Republican Sen. Bernie Moreno of Ohio, an enthusiastic supporter of the president, promised to introduce legislation in his own post on X.
Is this actually a problem in California?
Many housing industry professionals, economists and policy researchers are skeptical.
“It’s really hard to buy a house right now so people are looking for someone to blame for that, but I think (institutional investors) are more of a symptom of the affordability crisis than they are a perpetuator of it,” said Caitlin Gorback, a University of Texas at Austin economist who has studied investors’ effect on local real estate markets.
Research on the topic is mixed, though most analyses have found that by taking owner-occupied homes  and converting them into rentals, these companies tend to increase the supply of rentals. That puts downward pressure on rents, while taking away purchasable homes, leading to higher prices. 
That also takes away opportunities for would-be homeowners to buy a coveted single-family home. But even that comes with an under-appreciated upside, said Gorback: They provide more priced-out renters the opportunity to live in single-family homes — typically in wealthier, whiter and higher-resourced neighborhoods — something historically reserved for those who can afford to buy.
While apartment buildings are commonly owned and managed by large financial companies, single-family rentals weren’t seen as Wall Street-worthy money-making opportunities until the aftermath of the Great Recession. Since then, companies like Invitation Homes, Blackstone, Progress Residential and AMH Homes have typically focused on markets with relatively low prices and rapidly growing populations.
That doesn’t describe California. As a result, larger investors — however defined — make up a relatively small share of single-family landlords in the state. Fewer than 3% of all single-family homes in the state are owned by companies that own at least 10 properties, according to an analysis by the California Research Bureau, which conducts research for state lawmakers. A mere 20,066 are owned by firms with portfolios of 1,000 units or more. The largest of those owners is Invitation Homes, which owns over 11,000 homes in the state and reached a settlement with Attorney General Rob Bonta’s office last year over allegations it price-gouged tenants and illegally raised rents on more than 1,900 properties.
There are more than 16 million rental units across the state, according to Census data.
Though attacking big monied investors for the high cost of housing is a “huge distraction,” it has obvious political appeal, said Stan Oklobdzija, a UC Riverside public policy professor. “Attacking institutional investors is the latest iteration of appearing to do something without actually doing anything. …It’s just kind of archetypical cheap talk.”
For nearly a decade, Democrats in the state Legislature have proposed bills to track or ban the practice. Former Gov. Jerry Brown in 2018 vetoed a bill to create a registry of institutional investors that own 100 or more single-family homes, noting that “collecting the data would not stop the purchase of these homes by private investors.” 
In 2024, lawmakers proposed banning investors that own at least 1,000 single-family homes from buying more houses and renting them out, prohibiting institutional investors from buying single-family homes for any reason and banning developers from selling entire new single-family subdivisions to investors to rent. All three bills died in committees. 
Assemblymember Alex Lee, author of the first proposal, revived the bill last year. It passed the Assembly and awaits a hearing in a Senate committee. 
Lee, a Democratic Socialist who has long critiqued the role of big money in the state’s real estate market, said he was “flabbergasted” to find himself on the same page with Trump, whom he described as a “far-right fascist.” Though he expressed doubts that the Trump administration would follow through with the promises the president made in his social media post, he said that “Democrats need to wake up to this populist, but righteous, position.”
“We can’t let the far-right capture the housing positions that the people care about,” Lee said.

The conservative Republican and Casper businessman faces competition from Secretary of State Chuck Gray, and likely others, for Wyoming’s lone House seat.
The post Reid Rasner announces bid for U.S. House seat appeared first on WyoFile .","CHEYENNE—Casper-based businessman Reid Rasner has officially announced his candidacy for Wyoming’s sole seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, becoming the second entrant into the race following Secretary of State Chuck Gray’s announcement at the end of 2025.
Rasner, a conservative Republican who previously unsuccessfully challenged incumbent Sen. John Barrasso in 2024 in the Senate primaries, is entering the race with a personal commitment of $1 million to his campaign to spread his self-described “America First” platform to voters across the state.
According to a news release, Rasner is a fourth-generation Wyomingite who hopes to dismantle the status quo in Washington, D.C. He stated he hopes to work alongside President Donald Trump to “codify every piece of his agenda into law.”
“I am a proud and unapologetic America First conservative who will work with President Trump to deport criminal illegals, get fentanyl out of our communities, stop Democrat extremists and protect what makes Wyoming great,” Rasner wrote.
A staunch conservative
Rasner’s policy goals focus heavily on economic independence, border security and traditional conservative values, according to his website.
A central pillar of Rasner’s platform is domestic energy dominance. He advocates for Wyoming’s fossil fuel energy industry, specifically supporting Trump’s “Drill, Baby, Drill” policies for oil and gas, revitalizing the coal industry and investing in uranium mining in Wyoming. His vision for the state also includes transforming Wyoming into a national hub for financial technology, using the state’s business-friendly laws and lower taxes to attract global companies.
Rasner’s website outlines several other political views. This includes advocating for term limits to ensure citizen legislators over lifelong politicians, cutting federal government spending he sees as wasteful and defending the right to bear arms, including firearm safety education in schools.
He also maintains that life begins at conception. His social media post criticized Tuesday’s Wyoming Supreme Court decision upholding the legality of abortion in Wyoming.
2026 election and implications 
Rasner’s entry into the 2026 race comes at a time of significant transition for Wyoming’s federal delegation. The landscape shifted in December when Republican U.S. Sen. Cynthia Lummis announced that she would not seek a second six-year term. 
This prompted current Republican U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman to announce her intent to launch a bid for the Senate, a move that quickly garnered an endorsement from Trump.
The open seat in the House has already attracted other high-profile contenders. 
Secretary of State Gray announced his bid for the seat on Dec. 29, running as a “MAGA conservative.”
In his 2024 GOP bid for U.S. Senate, Rasner earned around 25,000 primary votes, or about 24%.
TikTok bid and defamation lawsuit
Rasner’s announcement follows a turbulent year in the headlines, defined by a high stakes business bid and an ongoing legal battle. In early 2025, Rasner garnered international attention for a reported $47.45 billion bid to purchase TikTok after the platform was ordered to divest from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance.
Rasner proposed moving the social media giant’s headquarters and data centers to Wyoming or South Dakota. 
However, by July, Rasner announced a “pause” on the acquisition, citing Chinese foreign policy and TikTok parent company ByteDance’s refusal to include the app’s core algorithm in the sale. Later, Rasner also cited comments made online that he said harmed his business reputation, ultimately leading to the failure of the deal.
This has resulted in an ongoing defamation lawsuit against former Wyoming State Sen. Anthony Bouchard. The lawsuit, filed in July, stems from social media posts in which Bouchard alleged that Rasner had a record of sexual misconduct while teaching at Casper College.
Rasner has vehemently denied the allegations, calling them a “malicious lie.” 
In late 2025, an affidavit from Casper College President Brandon Kosine revealed that an exhaustive search found no reports of sexual misconduct or investigations involving Rasner at the school. 
While the legal proceedings are ongoing, Rasner has indicated he will continue to seek legal action against those who shared those messages on social media.
“I’ve spent my career in the private sector getting things done, and I’m ready to take that know-how and the values of Wyomingites to Congress to Make America Great Again. I hope to earn your support as I crisscross the state,” Rasner wrote in his campaign news release.
At the time of publication, Rasner has yet to file for the race, and Gray is the only candidate to have officially filed so far.
In 2025, a campaign finance account emerged for Rasner under the office of governor. However, he never announced the run and confirmed he is not seeking to put together a bid for Wyoming governor in 2026.
(WyoFile editor’s note: In December, Bouchard filed a third party complaint against WyoFile, seeking to join the news outlet in the Rasner v. Bouchard litigation. WyoFile never alleged sexual misconduct on the part of Rasner.)

State agency director resigned under pressure in November and weeks later signed on to replace recently retired Doug Brimeyer.
The post Former Colorado wildlife boss Jeff Davis hired as Wyoming Game and Fish deputy director appeared first on WyoFile .","The Colorado Parks and Wildlife director who left his agency’s top job two months ago under pressure is weeks away from joining the Wyoming Game and Fish Department as a deputy director.
Jeff Davis, who was trained and worked as a biologist, will assume leadership of external operations at Game and Fish in early February, according to spokeswoman Amanda Fry. The hire drew a spate of headlines in Colorado partly because of the circumstances of Davis’ departure: He resigned in November instead of being terminated, according to documents acquired by 9News, the NBC affiliate in Denver.

The settlement agreement acquired by 9News did not specify why Davis was going to be fired, and a spokesman for the agency told the station he couldn’t comment on the matter. 
At the time of Colorado Parks and Wildlife’s late November announcement, Davis was said to be transitioning into a “senior policy advisor” role under Colorado Department of Natural Resources Executive Director Dan Gibbs. 
Less than a month later, however, Davis signed an employment offer from the Wyoming Game and Fish Department, according to additional documents acquired by 9News. 
Davis was hired by Colorado Gov. Jared Polis in the spring of 2023. Before that, he worked as the director of conservation for the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, capping a 22-year stint with that state agency.

For the last couple of years, Davis has helmed Parks and Wildlife through the high-profile and voter-initiated reintroduction of wolves to Colorado. 
Wolves have been a point of friction between Wyoming and Colorado even before reintroduction. The first Colorado wolf packs in 80 years resulted from natural dispersers who showed up on their own in 2019. In 2023, citing state statute, the Wyoming Game and Fish Department stopped informing the then-Davis-led Colorado Parks and Wildlife when members of another pack of dispersed wolves were killed by hunters north of the state line.
Subsequently, Brian Nesvik, a former Wyoming Game and Fish director, began challenging Colorado’s wolf reintroduction after his Trump administration appointment to direct the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 
On December 19, Nesvik sent Colorado Parks and Wildlife Acting Director Lauren Clellan a letter threatening to take over management of wolves in Colorado unless the state addressed compliance issues, according to reporting by the Fort Collins Coloradoan. 
Three days later, Davis, who’d already been ousted, signed the job offer with the Wyoming Game and Fish Department.

Davis steps into a post vacated by Doug Brimeyer, a Jackson-based wildlife biologist who rose through the ranks and retired after a 34-year career. 
“The wildlife and landscapes of western Wyoming provided an incredible backdrop for a career I’ve been truly grateful for,” Brimeyer wrote in an outgoing email to friends and colleagues. “I’ve had a fantastic career and have been fortunate to work with so many dedicated, talented wildlife professionals.”

Blake Tillery, the Vidalia Republican who chairs the Senate Special Committee on the Elimination of Georgia's Income Tax, unveiled the committee's recommendations at its final meeting on Jan. 7, 2026, in Atlanta. Alander Rocha/Georgia RecorderGeorgia GOP Senate leaders unveiled a plan Wednesday that would entirely eliminate the personal state income tax by 2032, shortly before House Speaker Jon Burns said the House would focus on cutting property taxes.
A special Senate committee voted 6-3, along party lines, to adopt its final legislative recommendations, which would waive income taxes for all Georgians on up to $50,000 a year for individuals and $100,000 for married couples starting in 2027.
Sen. Blake Tillery, the Vidalia Republican who chaired the committee, said the proposal is a “bottom-up” approach aimed at addressing rising costs for struggling Georgians. He pitched it as a solution to recent concerns about affordability, which Democrats successfully campaigned on in the 2025 off-year elections.
“The issue of affordability has been a buzzword since probably June or July,” said Tillery, who is also the Senate’s top budget writer. “This is the first vote that we are going to get to take to address affordability. I would urge you to think about that and think about how you can continue to say that that’s the number one issue, if you don’t support addressing it for Georgia families here.”

The plan would cost the state about $3 billion in the first year. To pay for it, Tillery pointed to nearly $1.9 billion surplus from the previous budget year as well as $1 billion in savings from a move to finance capital projects rather than using cash, and he said the rest could come from trimming roughly 10% of the state’s $30 billion in special-interest tax credits. The proposal is a priority for Lt. Gov. Burt Jones, who formed the committee and is running for governor in 2026. Tillery is a candidate for lieutenant governor.

In a press conference later on Wednesday, Burns, a Newington Republican, also acknowledged that affordability is a top issue going into the 2026 session. But he said the House will prioritize cutting property taxes on primary residences, saying that some Georgians have seen property tax increases of up to 185% over the previous year.
“That’s grossly unfair to Georgia homeowners, and probably just as importantly, maybe not quite as important, but it’s not sustainable,” Burns said.
But both Tillery and Burns said they would be open to considering each other’s proposals, with Tillery saying that he does “not view this as an either-or with the House.”
“The revenues go to completely different places, and the plan that we’ve drawn out with our state revenues to make this work are in no way impacted by anything they bring on property taxes,” Tillery said.
Burns said that “there’s nothing [the House and the Senate] can’t talk about,” but he was more critical of the Senate proposal, saying the math does not add up.
“We have to have the details, and it has to work, and we need to make sure we can continue to provide those services: health care, public safety, education, all the things we’ve talked about that continue to make Georgia the very best place to live and work,” Burns said.
Democrats on the Senate committee pushed back on the income tax cut proposal, saying that it would create a “$16 billion hole” in the state budget while ignoring critical needs in mental health, education and rural health care.
“This report recommends capping the budget and continuing to have our hands behind our back in terms of meeting the needs that we have,” said Atlanta Democratic Sen. Nan Orrock, adding that the state should instead focus on helping rural counties “that are so bereft of medical services,” increasing access to mental health services or fully funding pre-K for all Georgians.

Orrock also said that there is too much uncertainty around how Georgia will adapt to incoming federal funding cuts, which will reduce the state’s federal Medicaid funding by an estimated $5.4 billion over the next decade, according to a recent Georgia Health Initiative report.
“We heard no information in the course of this committee’s hearings on the impact of the cuts in Washington that are coming down that will hit our budget … We’re going to have needs that can be documented — should have been documented,” Orrock said.
Orrock also said that once fully implemented, the income tax cut would largely benefit people earning over $100,000, with $11.5 billion in tax cuts for the top 26% of income earners, compared to the $4 billion tax cut to the other three-quarters of Georgians.
“Is that what the citizenry is calling for? Helping the rich get richer? I don’t think so,” Orrock said after the meeting.
Danny Kanso, a senior fiscal analyst at the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute, also said that the proposal would largely benefit the wealthy. In a statement, he said that 74% of all benefits would go to households earning six-figures or more per year, adding that “this proposal would dramatically push Georgia’s budget out of balance in order to enrich those already at the top of the economic ladder, while working and middle-class families ultimately foot the bill.”
Without finding a new source of revenue to replace the $16 billion in personal income tax currently collected, most Georgians could see overall state taxes increase once the program is fully implemented, according to GBPI.
“The committee’s lack of specific recommendations to replace Georgia’s largest revenue source speaks volumes and points towards the most likely outcome: increasing Georgia’s sales tax and raising the cost of living,” Kanso said. “While most Georgians would see an average net tax increase of about $1,000 per year if the state shifts to a sales tax-based revenue system, those in the top 1% (earning more than $835,000 per year) would see average tax cuts of about $60,000 per year.”
Democratic Sen. Ed Harbison of Columbus called the proposed deductions “a hard thing to vote against,” but said the committee should be more fiscally conservative with the timeline. Instead of “taking one giant step and doing it all in one fell swoop,” Harbison suggested the committee should instead consider a more gradual income tax decrease.
“I hear your very logical and conservative budgeting, and I applaud you for that. We have been doing that, and I thought that we would continue down that road,” he said.

With only four weeks to sway voters, two Republican state Senate hopefuls are on the clock to prove who opposes a controversial Franklin County prison project more — or find another issue that resonates.

Wade Dunn, a retired businessman who has the endorsement of the late Sen. Gary Stubblefield’s family, and Brad Simon, a small business owner who vastly outspent the other Republicans in the race, advanced to a Feb. 6 runoff. The winner of that race will face independent Adam Watson in the March 3 special election.
Tuesday’s special primary for Senate District 26, which is comprised of parts of Franklin, Logan, Sebastian and Johnson counties, drew much higher than typical turnout.
The relatively short campaign period in the run-up to Tuesday’s primary was dominated by the candidates’ opposition to the 3,000-bed Franklin County prison project championed by Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders and her allies that has earned the ire of local officials and residents.
Sanders and prison supporters say it is a necessary solution to longstanding state prison capacity shortages. But opponents say locals were not given a say in locating the prison in their community, and argue the 815-acre site isn’t right for the facility.
Republican primary for Arkansas Senate seat at center of prison project debate headed to runoff

In Franklin and Logan counties, “the proximity to the prison issue drove turnout to be probably, what I would say, twice as high what you would see in an average special election primary,” Robert Coon, a Republican strategist and lobbyist, said. Comparatively, turnout in Sebastian and Johnson counties was much lower.
Franklin County and Logan County saw 16.7% and 19.1% of registered voters cast ballots in the election. In Sebastian and Johnson counties, 9.6% and 7.5% of voters went to the polls — numbers still much higher than turnout in the other special election for House District 70, which saw 3.8% of registered voters cast a vote.
Primaries generally have lower turnout compared to general elections, he said, and tend to consist of the most active voters. The higher turnout in some, but not all, counties was a sign of the prison project’s importance in the minds of the voters set to be most affected by the prison, he said.
One of the biggest challenges for the candidates will be getting people to keep paying attention since turnout likely won’t be as high in the runoff, Coon said. Since both Republicans vying for the nomination have largely similar platforms, he said, the candidates will need to find differentiators that matter to voters over the next four weeks.
Nationwide, affordability is shaping up to be a talking point in the 2026 midterms, and Arkansas is no exception, Coon said.
“If you ask people, ‘What’s the number one issue if I’m going to earn your vote,’ we know what they’re going to say,” he said. “But what are issues two and three, and can one of the candidates make some gains with that?”
Dunn touted his support Wednesday for eliminating property taxes on people over the age of 65 and veterans, and for creating an Arkansas equivalent to Elon Musk’s short-lived Department of Government Efficiency — known as DOGE — at the federal level.
“This thing comes down to trust,” Dunn said. Voters will have to decide a basic question when choosing between him and Simon, he said: “Are these men going to represent the people, or are they going to represent the government?”
Simon has said he wants to continue lowering income taxes and reduce state regulation. Wednesday, he also cited cutting taxes and easing inflation pressure as top issues.
“We need an effective voice for our district, not just the loudest voice in the room,” he said in a text message. “Someone that has proven they can get things done against all odds.”
Still, the prison issue dominates. In an interview with the Arkansas Advocate, Watson said that “nine times out of ten,” the first question he is asked when he’s knocking on doors and talking to voters is about his position on the prison.
Former state Rep. Mark Berry, who came in third in the unofficial results, told the Advocate he was endorsing Simon in the runoff, calling the primary’s runner up a “man of principle” while criticizing Dunn as someone who would “do and say anything to get elected.”
Stacie Smith and Ted Tritt, the other two Republican candidates who conceded, had not announced endorsements of either of their former opponents as of Wednesday afternoon.

The cut — issued just before the Legislature will reconvene as the state faces projected budget deficits  — sets the Attorney General’s Office apart from executive branch agencies managed by Gov. Brad Little. In 2020, Little issued an executive order requiring eight weeks of paid time off for executive branch agencies, and he encouraged the state’s other elected officials to follow suit. 
“The eight-week paid parental leave began in 2020 as a discretionary executive policy, not a legislative mandate,” the Attorney General Office’s General Counsel and latest Chief of Staff Yvonne Dunbar said in a statement Wednesday. “As public servants, we work for Idaho taxpayers, and this adjustment reflects our commitment to responsible stewardship of their resources while supporting our team.”
Staff in the Attorney General’s Office who need more time after the birth or adoption of a child, and who qualify for leave under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act, or FMLA, “may use accrued sick leave, as well as unpaid FMLA leave,” Skinner wrote in the email to staff. 
Labrador’s spokesperson Damon Sidur said Skinner was promoted to chief deputy attorney general on Monday.

Court backlog. 
The phrase has defined a malaise that’s permeated the Vermont Legislature’s work on public safety initiatives in recent years. When Covid-19 slowed down the judicial system, criminal cases piled up, leading defendants and victims to wait years for resolution.
Enter the Chittenden County accountability docket. Proposed by Gov. Phil Scott last fall, the pilot project dedicated court time and staff to expediting hearings for people with five or more pending criminal cases, sometimes called dockets. 
On Wednesday, some of the key leaders of the program reported the project had been a success. But its future — whether in Chittenden County or expanded across the state — is uncertain. 
Since October, the special court or “docket,” which focuses on lower-level offenses, has resolved almost 400 cases of the nearly 900 under its purview, according to data presented by Jaye Johnson, the governor’s counsel, to the House Committee on Corrections and Institutions. 
Having recently spent a day observing a Burlington courthouse, Rep. Brian Minier, D-South Burlington, summed up the special program’s effectiveness. In a “regular” courtroom, hearings were scheduled three months out. But in room 3B — the designated space for the accountability program — the judge met weekly with defendants. 
Tim Lueders-Dumont, who leads the Vermont Department of State’s Attorneys and Sheriffs, said the promise of the pilot hinged on the excellent collaboration between the special prosecutor, designated defense attorney, the judge and human services staff. 
It’s been “successful,” he said, but “we’re not going to say mission accomplished.”
The Burlington-based initiative is scheduled to phase out in the beginning of February. Rutland County is a possible location for a next version of the program, the leaders hinted, but they stressed that Chittenden County’s model won’t work everywhere. Conversations have begun to figure out how every county might create designated time for resolving cases involving defendants with numerous dockets. 
And that model makes sense, according to the data. Statewide, cases involving people with five or more pending dockets make up 28% of all dockets, according to Lueders-Dumont. Those with three or more make up about half.

In the know
Vermont Foodbank CEO John Sayles updated the House Committee on Agriculture, Food Resiliency, and Forestry on Wednesday morning about his organization’s Vermonters Feeding Vermonters program, which spent hundreds of thousands in public and philanthropic funds purchasing food from local farmers in 2025. But after Act 34 created a grant program for the initiative last year without guaranteed funding, state budget writers approved just a fraction of the backing Sayles — and the agriculture committee — sought.
“One of the key provisions of our food security roadmap is making sure our agriculture community is strong,” Sayles said in his testimony Wednesday.
In addition to a $1.5 million budget increase to this year’s $500,000 grant for Vermonters Feeding Vermonters, the Foodbank will request a total of $5 million for next year to fully fund the program again, and shore up the organization’s ability to meet emergency need in “natural and man-made disasters,” Sayles said.
Though food assistance is a priority for legislative leaders, many have said this session’s financial pressures — both from federal cuts and an apparent dip in state revenues — may make grants to individual organizations significantly more competitive.

On the move … or not?
“It’s pure bullshit.”
That’s what Senate President Pro Tem Phil Baruth, D/P-Chittenden Central, told reporters Wednesday about the notion that there isn’t enough support in the House this year to advance a charter change bill that would ban guns from bars in Burlington.
Baruth is the measure’s primary backer. Since the bill, S.131, passed the Senate last April, it got a lukewarm reception in the House Government Operations and Military Affairs Committee and stalled there. The proposal also has a powerful opponent: Republican Gov. Phil Scott, who has said repeatedly he’d veto it, should legislators send it to his desk. (Charter changes must get approval in Montpelier before they can take effect locally.)
Baruth, Burlington Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak and City Council President Ben Traverse held a press conference Wednesday at the Statehouse to drum up support for the measure and call on the House to pass it. During the presser, Baruth suggested that if the government operations committee wouldn’t move the bill, an individual House member should stand up on the floor and ask that gov ops be relieved of it. From there, the member could ask that it be directed to a different committee. (Such a procedural move would require majority support to succeed.)
House gov ops heard some testimony on the charter change Wednesday morning, though took no action on it. Rep. Matt Birong, D-Vergennes, the gov ops chair, said his panel planned to discuss the bill further in the coming weeks but was not sure yet whether he would bring it up for a committee vote.

Above the law
The Senate Judiciary Committee briefly discussed Wednesday some of their unique and ancient protections. State law prohibits legislators and many statewide elected officials from being arrested on their way to and from their work at the Statehouse, except for felonies, treason and breach of peace. That includes traffic tickets on the way to work, apparently, according to Sen. Chris Mattos, R-Chittenden North. But they can be sent those tickets later. Careful on 89.

The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
Riewestahl said the ICE agents were identified when they arrived at the courthouse and parked a vehicle in the parking lot.
The federal agents “entered on the ground floor and stood in the vestibule,” Riewestahl said. “Some were making phone calls, others were just on their phones and/or talking amongst themselves.”
He added that a “few went further into the courthouse,” probably to use the restrooms.
Concerning whether the ICE agents had contacted his office requesting help to detain people, Riewestahl said, “They have not, nor have we assisted with anything related to ICE.”
Riewestahl shared that the office’s policy manual for field services (patrol) and security services (jail) regarding immigration status directs patrol officers not to detain anyone accused of a “civil violation of federal immigration laws or a related civil warrant,” and the jail is only allowed to hold individuals who have “been charged with a federal crime,” or has been issued “a warrant, affidavit of probable cause or removal order.”

(Photo by Janine L. Weisman/Rhode Island Current)Two days into Rhode Island’s six-month 2026 legislative session, Providence Mayor Brett Smiley briefed reporters Wednesday afternoon on his legislative priorities.
Smiley told reporters at City Hall that his administration’s priorities “have remained pretty consistent” since he took office in 2023, and this year is more of the same, with his office seeking to stabilize city finances, address the housing market and take back Providence’s public schools from the state control they’ve been under since 2019.  
“There’s sure to be other pieces of legislation that individual legislators promote that we will throw our support behind,” Smiley said. “But these are our priorities and our package.”
One notable omission in light of the Dec. 13 mass shooting at Brown University is legislation on gun control. Smiley noted the state already has “relatively strict gun regulations” and Providence is not proposing any new ones. But he said “it’s entirely possible” the city could support such legislation if it appears at the State House this year.
The city has not yet tallied the total municipal cost of its response to the shooting which killed two teenaged Brown undergrads and injured nine other students. In the midst of the chaos, the city’s ledgers were not of great import, Smiley said. 
“There was never a decision that was made, or a choice that was deferred or denied, based upon what the overtime cost might have been from any of the public safety tools at our disposal.”
Cost resumes its usual relevance, however, in the city’s legislative priorities this session. Smiley could not specify which state legislators would sponsor the city’s bills, as his office is still hammering out sponsorship with General Assembly leadership. The mayor’s office estimated the bills will likely be submitted later this month. 
Providence Mayor Brett Smiley’s 2026 legislative wish list for his city includes an increase to the state’s Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILOT) base rate and a 25% payroll tax tied to new jobs at tax-exempt nonprofit institutions. (Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)
1: Increase the Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILOT) rate statewide
Smiley acknowledged that all signs point to “a tough budget year for the state,” but he’s hoping legislators will agree to shoulder a three-pillared support system for Providence’s own finances in the upcoming fiscal year. First on his wishlist is increasing the state’s Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILOT) base rate from 27% to 30% of foregone revenue.
Municipalities make PILOT agreements with nonprofits to generate revenue that is lost due to the organizations’ tax-exempt status. The state also doles out PILOT funds to municipalities via a calculation that combines the total assessed value of tax-exempt properties statewide, which is then divvied up and “gets sent back proportionally to cities and towns based upon the tax exempt property that they have in their respective communities,” Smiley explained.  
“What we’re saying is the pot should get bigger,” Smiley said.
He said the PILOT rate has not been increased since 1986.
The city hasn’t convened with other municipalities yet about the legislation, Smiley said, but the mayor expects other towns and cities will get on board as “anybody who receives PILOT funding will benefit from this.” 
PILOT payments are especially important in Providence, where nonprofits eat up an estimated 42% of the city’s real estate, leaving the city unable to reap benefits from the approximately $8 billion in assessed value these properties represent.    
Smiley’s administration helped broker the city’s PILOT deals with large nonprofits like Brown University and Brown University Health. But Smiley did not seek to further antagonize the nonprofits. The bargaining table, he said, often revolves around “not an impasse…just a slow negotiation.”
“I think the events of last month underscore a point that we’ve made for a long time, which is that all of our fates are tied together,” the mayor said. “I want the hospitals to be financially successful. They need to want the city to be financially stable.”

2: 25% payroll tax tied to new jobs at tax-exempt nonprofit institutions. 
Providence submitted this legislation two years ago, Smiley said, and it returns now as he still believes it a suitable way to procure more revenue from nontaxable nonprofits. The mayor clarified that while the proposal would not fatten the state’s current deficit, it would ultimately draw from the future state’s tax base, because Providence would receive a share of the state’s income tax.
Still, the arrangement could be beneficial for all involved, Smiley thought: “It’s in the state’s best interest that the city, instead of fighting the institutions’ growth, be encouraging the institutions’ growth, and that we be partners with the state in trying to get these places to add jobs and grow.”
3: Full funding of the Distressed Communities Relief Fund in the state budget
Providence got about $8 million last year from this funding source in the state budget last year. Smiley said he wants the state to keep the line item “held flat, to not be cut,” which would leave Providence’s share at roughly $8.1 million.
The preliminary version of Gov. Dan McKee’s budget is expected to arrive in the days after his Jan. 13 State of the State address. Lawmakers will then refine the budget throughout the legislative session.

4: Is this the year Providence gets its schools back?
Another legislative package wrapped in déjà vu is the city’s request to get back its public schools from the Rhode Island Department of Education. Smiley said he wants the schools to return to local control by July 2026, adding the legislation “should be no surprise.”
The protracted tug of war for power over the capital city’s historically underperforming schools began in 2019, when the education department assumed control via a little-used state law. In 2024, the state extended its control up to 2027. The same year, city and state concluded a funding dispute in court, with Providence on the hook for at least three years’ worth of boosted funding.
That settlement is still shaping the city’s fiscal commitments to its schools, with Smiley noting that about $147.5 million overall is earmarked for fiscal year 2027, plus whatever percentage increase in education aid appears in this year’s state budget.
The transition could happen through legislation or from direct action by state education commissioner Angélica Infante-Green. 
“We would be happy for her to make a commitment next week that the schools are coming back this summer,” Smiley said, and argued that the purely legislative route was still suboptimal. “Getting permission in June for a July takeback would be difficult and probably a bumpier transition than is in the best interest of students.” 
Providence submitted similar legislation last year, but this year, things are different because the city has “stayed at work since the end of the legislative session,” Smiley said. “Similarly, the school board has done exactly what they have been asked to do.”
Providence School Board President Ty’Relle Stephens submitted a letter to legislative leadership Wednesday afternoon in support of the still-to-come legislation.
5: Return of the housing bond
A $25 million general obligation housing bond could go before voters this November, if lawmakers approve Providence’s request for the ballot. Smiley said voters last approved a housing bond in 2021, and that the $29 million it allocated helped to “seed” the city’s Affordable Housing Trust Fund. But there’s now less than $1 million left to disperse from that bond, Smiley said.
The taxpayer money borrowed via bond issue would “be restricted to affordable housing projects here in Providence,” Smiley said, arguing a new bond would help the city seize competitive borrowing rates and maintain momentum on easing the housing shortage.
6: More enforcement of penalties for box blockers
More modest among Smiley’s proposals is a request to extend the city’s “Block the Box” pilot program to 2030. In 2024, lawmakers authorized municipalities to enforce violations at up to three intersections for motorists whose impatience causes them to clog intersections.   
The program will sunset in 2027, but Smiley said the city needs more time to test and analyze the data of its camera-driven enforcement to stop box-blocking. Providence’s pilot program remains so nascent that Smiley said the city has not yet found a suitable vendor for the needed technology, because “other communities in America are not doing this. The city is reviewing responses it received from a request for proposals that went out in fall 2025.
“All of our camera technology in Providence is not meant to be revenue-enhancing,” Smiley said. “It’s meant to be behavior-changing…We want people to follow the rules of the road and not enrage people by standing in the middle of an intersection when the light turns red.”

 7: Protecting a bridge to nowhere 
The Crook Point Bascule Bridge, also known in local tongue as the Ghost Bridge, sits at the perimeter of Providence’s Fox Point and stretches over the Seekonk River — well, only partially, as it’s been drawn up since 1976. Smiley wants the state to authorize a new quasi-public agency, the Crook Point Bridge Authority, to whom the Rhode Island Department of Transportation could transfer ownership.
Smiley admitted his imaginings for the iconic landmark don’t quite fit his reputation for exacting governance: “This is a little bit unlike me in that we don’t have a firm plan for this bridge.”
But Smiley thinks the much-graffitied but much-loved structure could be renewed in its importance if owned by a non-governmental entity, which would make it easier to fundraise and manage insurance and liability for what he called an “an asset that is admittedly old.”
“There’s a lot of foundations and such that have either actual restrictions or no interest in giving to government itself,” Smiley said. 
The mayor is opposed to demolishing the bridge — something RIDOT tried to do in 2019 — and noted the pedestrian bridge near South Water Street as proof the city can brainstorm first, blueprint later. 
The annual upkeep for Crook Point span is “de minimis,” Smiley said, limited to things like fixing fences or mowing brush in the area. The city has no desire to make the bridge operational, lower the span, or fix its rusty gears.
“We want to make sure that it remains safe and stable until such time as we have a full plan for it,” Smiley said.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Utah’s troubling rates of violence against women have driven me, over several years, to attempt to understand why this crisis persists and what it will take to meaningfully reverse it. I don’t claim to have every answer, but I have developed a deeper understanding of the interconnected factors that — often invisibly — contribute to this violence. One of these factors is the lack of appetite Utahns — both leaders and residents — have to break the silence and face this issue head on.
As you might imagine, the perpetuation of violence is a complex issue that is often ignored in many U.S. states and other counties around the world. Utah is no exception. Violence against women is an uncomfortable topic, and concerns are often swept under the rug. Even though this violence is widespread worldwide, it remains one of the most silenced social issues. Several interconnected forces drive that silence in Utah and beyond. I will highlight six:
First, it’s uncomfortable and socially taboo: The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) notes that gender‑based violence remains “shrouded in silence” because it is considered uncomfortable and stigmatized to discuss openly. People fear saying the wrong thing, being judged, or confronting painful realities. According to another source, silence becomes a form of self‑protection — both for individuals who don’t want to disrupt social harmony and for institutions that fear reputational consequences. In many communities, naming the problem feels like an accusation, so people default to avoiding it altogether. This avoidance doesn’t reduce the violence; it simply pushes it further underground.
Second, it challenges existing power structures: Violence against women is rooted in deep power imbalances. Naming the problem forces communities, institutions, and individuals to confront the ways power is misused or protected. That makes people defensive — especially those who benefit from the status quo. One global study highlighted how communities resist acknowledging violence, especially when it challenges cultural or patriarchal norms. When these norms are challenged, leaders and residents frequently deny or minimize the violence, and survivors who speak up face social retaliation for disrupting the expected order.
Third, it hits close to home. Most violence against women is committed by intimate partners or family members, not strangers lurking in dark alleys. Talking about it means acknowledging that the threat isn’t “out there” — it’s inside homes, families, churches, and communities. That proximity makes people shut down. It forces communities to confront the possibility that respected neighbors, leaders, or even relatives may be perpetrators. Research from a “Women in the States” report further shows that intimate partner violence cuts across every demographic group, reinforcing that no community is exempt. When the danger is this close, denial becomes a coping mechanism, and silence becomes a way to preserve the illusion of safety.
Fourth, people underestimate the scale of the problem. The UNDP highlights that even highly informed young people often don’t know basic facts about gender‑based violence or global campaigns to address it. This is true in Utah. When people don’t see the scope, they don’t feel urgency. This lack of awareness is reinforced by the fact that gender‑based violence is chronically under‑measured, making the true scale difficult for the public to grasp. A 2025 scholarly review on the topic found that inconsistent data collection and narrow definitions of gender‑based violence lead to widespread underestimation of its prevalence, especially in institutional and community settings. Without accurate data, communities underestimate both the magnitude and the urgency of the crisis.
Fifth, cultural norms discourage speaking up. In many places — including Utah — cultural expectations around modesty, obedience, forgiveness, or family unity can discourage women from reporting violence and discourage communities from acknowledging it. A research synthesis found that social norms — especially silence, stigma, and normalization of abuse — are among the strongest barriers to community recognition of violence. Violence is often treated as a private matter rather than a collective concern, which reinforces the idea that speaking up is disloyal or disruptive. These norms don’t just suppress reporting; they actively shape how communities respond, often prioritizing reputation, harmony, or religious ideals over women’s safety.
Sixth, systems are not designed to respond well — and that leaves people feeling powerless. When survivors see that institutions fail to protect them, they learn that speaking up is risky. When bystanders see that institutions fail to hold perpetrators accountable, they learn that speaking up is futile. Even when laws exist, social norms and community resistance make it difficult to enforce protections or talk openly about violence. Communities often ignore or circumvent these laws because of entrenched gender norms, leaving activists to fight uphill battles just to get authorities and leaders to take violence against women seriously. Faced with such systemic failure, many people feel powerless; they avoid the topic because they don’t know what to do or fear that nothing they do will matter. Silence becomes the default.
The bottom-line is this: We owe women and girls more than quiet concern — we owe them action. That means speaking honestly, challenging harmful norms, and insisting that our systems protect those they were built to serve. Utah can do better, but only if we decide that silence is no longer an option.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/102325_Domestic-Violence_05-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-07 18:59:33.401172

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)A federal government announcement this week dropping some vaccines from the list recommended for routine childhood immunization has drawn opposition from medical professionals nationwide and concern from the Wisconsin health department.
The Wisconsin Department of Health Services is reviewing information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about the change in vaccine recommendations “and is doing so with great concern for the health of children in our state,” Jennifer Miller, a DHS communications specialist, told the Wisconsin Examiner in an email message Tuesday.
“Health professionals and parents deserve accurate, credible information,” Miller wrote. “We have not yet seen new scientific evidence that would justify changes to longstanding recommendations that have and continue to protect the health of children in the United States.”
The decision to stop recommending certain vaccines is “dangerous and unnecessary,” the president of the American Academy of Pediatrics said in a statement posted Monday at the professional association’s website.
Among the diseases dropped from those recommended for routine immunization are hepatitis A and B, rotavirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), flu, and meningococcal disease.
“AAP continues to recommend that children be immunized against these diseases, and for good reason; thanks to widespread childhood immunizations, the United States has fewer pediatric hospitalizations and fewer children facing serious health challenges than we would without this community protection,” said Dr. Andrew Racine, AAP president, in the statement.
Miller said that DHS will continue its assessment of the CDC’s recommendation changes as well as those from “other trusted medical and public health agencies.” The department plans to issue more information on Thursday, she said.

October 10, 2023. (Photo by Claire Stremple/Alaska Beacon)A national support line for Native survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault has begun work to launch an Alaska-specific service. 
Strong Hearts Native Helpline is a Native-led nonprofit that offers 24-hour, seven-day-a-week support for anonymous and confidential calls from people who have experienced domestic violence or sexual assault. 
The line is staffed by Native advocates, but Strong Hearts Deputy Executive Officer Rachel Carr-Shunk said there are not yet any Alaska Native people answering phone calls.
That is set to change soon.

“Even though we’re a Native organization and all of our advocates are American Indian, we do recognize that there is a difference for our Alaska Native relatives who experience violence in that context, whether they live in a rural village or they just live in Alaska, which is a different experience,” she said.
Carr-Shunk expects the organization to launch the Alaska-specific line within the next calendar year, after building partnerships in the state. 
“When Alaska Native survivors reach out, we want them to trust that they’re going to have someone who understands their experience as an Alaska Native person, or who understands that identity,” she said.
To that end, the organization has hired Anchorage-based Minnie Sneddy, who is originally from Hooper Bay. Sneddy is tasked with explaining Alaska’s regional differences and specific needs to the organization, as well as helping create a database of Alaska resources. 
Sneddy has years of experience in behavioral health work and said that her career and life experience have shown her the lack of resources for people who face domestic violence and sexual assault — and how many of those people need mental health support.
“The years I lived in Hooper Bay, and here in Anchorage and Alaska, there’s so many (people) that need help and want help, but they feel like if they do come forward and get help, they get in trouble — not only with their families, but with OCS, Office of Children’s Services,” she said. “I feel like Strong Hearts Native Helpline can help at least allow a person to be heard, because the majority of time, people want to be heard. Everyone just wants to feel seen and be heard.”
Sneddy said she is reaching out to resources that already exist in the state, and Strong Hearts is working with the Alaska Native Women’s Resource Center to build out its state-specific service.
Alaska has the third-highest rate of intimate partner violence against women in the nation and men kill women in Alaska at a higher rate than anywhere else in the country. In a state where nearly half of women have experienced domestic violence in their lifetimes, Alaska Native women are particularly vulnerable.
“We don’t have a voice, really, in the villages,” Sneddy said, adding that when abuse happens: “There’s no help for an individual. And if a woman decides to do something about it, she’s seen as a bad person.”
The Strong Hearts Native Helpline is available now for Alaskans, even though there are not yet Alaska Native advocates on the other end of the line. A full list of Alaska shelters and victim’s services providers can be found in the state directory at law.alaska.gov.

Rep. Mike Nathe, R-Bismarck, confirmed he is working on a school meals bill draft for possible consideration in the session that begins Jan. 21. Lawmakers rejected proposals for free school meals last year, but proponents are working to put a ballot measure before voters this November. 
Nathe said Wednesday it was too early to provide details of his proposal.

“These things take time,” Nathe said. “Hopefully, we’ll have something by the special session.”
The Together for School Meals coalition is gathering signatures for a constitutional ballot measure. If approved in a statewide vote, it would mandate the state provide free school meals to North Dakota K-12 students. 
Lawmakers began planning for the potential fiscal impact of the program last month, even before proponents began collecting signatures. The Department of Public Instruction estimates a free school meals program in North Dakota would cost about $134 million for a two-year budget cycle, but the cost estimate could change as the potential program continues to be studied. Nathe and other lawmakers expressed concerns about the sustainability of funding the program, which could grow by $6 million to $7 million every two years under preliminary estimates. 
House Majority Leader Mike Lefor, R-Dickinson, who has talked with Nathe about the proposal, said he prefers that policy issues involving spending be handled through a statute rather than added to the state constitution.

“Constitutionally-mandated spending doesn’t take into account potential increases and decreases in revenue, and it just ties your hands,” Lefor said. He added it would be easier for lawmakers to make changes to a law than an article in the state constitution.
It’s not yet clear if the topic will be discussed in the special session. 
Gov. Kelly Armstrong called the special session to allocate $199 million in federal Rural Health Transformation Program funding. 
Any bill that would be considered during the session must be advanced through Legislative Management, a bipartisan committee of legislative leaders, before it reaches the full Legislature. 
Senate Majority Leader David Hogue, R-Minot, chair of Legislative Management, said Wednesday he feels the school meal issue was already addressed by state lawmakers.
“I’m not in favor of relitigating issues that were already heard and decided by the legislative assembly, in regular session, back in January through April,” Hogue said. 
If the bill comes before Legislative Management when the committee meets next Wednesday, Hogue said the committee will listen to the presentation and make a decision at that time.

Lefor, vice chair of Legislative Management, said he hopes to keep the session focused on the rural health funding.
“We’re going to want to be really tight with bills that get introduced simply because we have a three-day session,” he said. 
Lefor said he believes any bill that could be brought to the full Legislature outside of the rural health funding would need to be an emergency that can’t wait until the 2027 legislative session.
Legislative Council, the research arm of the Legislature, has received requests to prepare about 20 bill drafts for the special session, said Director John Bjornson. More information has not been made public. A bill draft request is not a public record unless a lawmaker chooses to disclose it. 
Lawmakers could choose to meet longer than three days. In October 2023, the most recent time the Legislature had a special session, lawmakers met for three days after the state Supreme Court invalidated the Office of Management and Budget bill approved earlier that year. Legislative Management chose to keep that session narrowly focused, rejecting many bill proposals except for a resolution of support for Israel.
Meanwhile, proponents of the ballot measure plan to continue to gather signatures, said Robin Nelson, chair of the ballot measure sponsoring committee.
“At this point, we are just forging forward,” she said. “It’s hard for us to comment on their plan without seeing the verbage.”
Nelson said funding school meals for students has widespread support across the state.
“I think it’s undeniable that our ballot initiative is motivating them to take action now,” she said.

Michelle Lujan Grisham's ask for what she says it will take to fund universal childcare. (Patrick Lohmann/Source NM).State legislative leaders on Wednesday released a budget proposal that fails to fully fund one of outgoing New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s signature policies: universal child care for families with young children. 
The governor announced last September that the state would eliminate income requirements for families to receive waivers for their portions — copayments — of child care costs. Previously, only families that earned less than 400% of the federal poverty level received copay waivers. 
In enacting that change, New Mexico became the first state in the nation to offer free universal childcare.
The state Early Childhood Education and Care Department officially launched the program in November. Last month, Lujan Grisham’s office released a budget proposal that includes $163.2 million from the state’s recurring general fund to keep the program running through July 2027. That represents a 54.1% increase from the previous year.
NM Governor’s office proposes $11.3B state budget and increased spending

 
But in a news conference Wednesday at the Roundhouse, legislative leaders released their own budget proposal, which only increases ECECD’s appropriations from the general fund by $13.7 million, or 4.5%. They also reiterated that while New Mexico is in healthy financial shape compared with other states, market conditions and other indicators point toward more fiscal restraint in the upcoming year. 
In detailed budget proposal documents from the Legislative Finance Committee, which drafted the proposal, analysts predict that universal free childcare will “create additional demand for Childcare Assistance without the necessary revenues to implement this policy decision should more people apply and qualify for subsidies.”
Sen. George Muñoz (D-Gallup), who chairs the Senate Finance Committee, also noted Lujan Grisham’s budget proposal includes spending that exceeds her second and final term in office, which ends Dec. 31 of this year. 
New Mexico governor announces free universal child care

“This governor is trying to spend into the next administration’s money,” Muñoz said at the news conference. 
An ECECD program analysis shows costs for universal child care increasing for several years — funding for which would mostly come from state coffers — from a little over $445 million this fiscal year to nearly $730 million by fiscal year 2029. 
LFC Chair Rep. Nathan Small (D-Las Cruces) told Source New Mexico on Wednesday that “all options are on the table” when it comes to reaching a compromise with the governor on one of her signature policies. 
He expects the Legislature and the governor to “work closely” in search of other funding sources or a “prioritization system” that ensures those who most need childcare get it as the program builds additional capacity and hires more childcare providers. 
“I want to emphasize that this is a start and that a great deal of the work is to come during the session,” he said.
He defended the Legislature’s funding proposal as prudent in the face of a worsening economy, while also maintaining funding for childcare subsidies for those “those who need it most.” 
“In a year where we have more pressures, more storm clouds, economically and otherwise on the horizon, and less money coming in…we have to be very focused on sustainability,” he said. “You know, two and three and four and more years from now, what this could look like.”
New Mexico lawmakers to tackle reduced spending in the new year’s budget

The governor’s Communications Director Michael Coleman told Source in an emailed statement that the governor was “disappointed” by the Legislature’s proposal.
“Governor Lujan Grisham is disappointed by the LFC’s early childhood budget proposal, but she is not surprised—and she is not deterred,” he said. “Executive and legislative budgets are rarely aligned initially. The Governor is confident the Legislature will fund universal childcare at levels that match the public’s strong support for this historic initiative.”
Small said at the news conference Wednesday changes contained in the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” President Donald Trump signed last year created “national headwinds,” along with other factors outside the state’s control, that spell the end of a multi-year streak of sharply growing state budgets. 
To that end, the LFC’s budget’s recommendation calls for spending $11.1 billion from the state’s general fund, a 2.5%, or $268 million, increase over FY26 planned spending.

(Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)This story was originally posted on IdahoEdNews.org on Jan. 7, 2026.
Idaho Superintendent of Public Instruction Debbie Critchfield on Wednesday announced she is running for a second term.
In a campaign launch video, the Republican says she is focused on getting education “back to the basics.” She touted the state’s gains in career readiness during her tenure and the highest graduation rate in 10 years. Elementary literacy has improved under a renewed push for phonics instruction. Critchfield has also helped ensure parents are key stakeholder in their kids’ education.
“I remain committed to clear, practical priorities, responsible use of taxpayer dollars and supporting local schools as they meet the unique needs of their communities,” Critchfield said in the video. “We’ve made real progress, but there’s still important work ahead.”
Critchfield was elected in 2022 to a four-year term as the state’s top public education official. She previously served as a Cassia County School District trustee for 10 years and seven years as a member of the Idaho State Board of Education. She lives in Oakley with her husband, where they raised four children.
In her first three years, Critchfield has shown mixed legislative results with success in some areas but no movement on updating the K-12 funding formula, which hasn’t changed since 1994.
In 2023, she helped pass three bills through the Idaho Legislature, including her signature initiative, the Idaho Career Ready Students Program. With an initial investment of $45 million, the program funds career and technical education in grades seven through 12.
“From reading proficiency to career pathways and real-world readiness, we are focused on results that matter to Idaho families,” Critchfield said in a news release. “Our students deserve an education that prepares them not just to graduate but to build a strong future.”
Also in her first year, she passed House Bill 92 to require high schools to teach a financial literacy class and House Bill 163 to reinforce parental rights in education. Another bill she supported that outlined training requirements for school trustees failed.
In 2024, Critchfield succeeded in one of three of her priorities. She helped secure $145 million for school districts to fill a hole left by a shift to attendance-based funding. But two bills — House Bill 595 and House Bill 718 — that would have changed Idaho’s school funding formula failed.
She faced more challenges on that front during the 2025 session.
Critchfield supported a funding formula with different weights for special education students, English language learners, economically disadvantaged students and kids who attend rural schools. Senate Bill 1096 passed in the Senate but was never heard in the House. Another bill that would have created a $3 million high-needs student fund to help kids with disabilities passed in the House but died in the Senate. 
Her staff last year also proposed changes to Idaho’s graduation requirements, but Legislators pared down the proposal and created a new high school digital literacy class requirement, which will go into effect in 2028.
For this year’s session, which begins Monday, Critchfield has already walked back her top legislative priority. She proposed in August a $50 million investment in special education but pulled the request last month due to the state’s budget shortfall.
“We want to be careful, we want to be deliberate in what we ask,” Critchfield told State Board of Education members in December. “The first priority for me is to maintain current budget levels.”
 No election challengers yet

Critchfield does not appear to have any challengers within her own party or from the Democrats. She’s the only state superintendent candidate to file financial forms with the secretary of state, which is a precursor to running. But Idaho Democrats are prioritizing a challenger. Party Chair Lauren Necochea told EdNews last month that getting a Democrat in the race by the end of January would give them “enough runway.” 
“It’s the statewide office we’ve held most recently as a party,” Necochea said. “It’s the race that we’ve come the closest to winning statewide in recent cycles.”
Critchfield’s campaign has raised $72,000 for the 2026 election cycle, including a $5,000 contribution from Micron Technology.
 The filing period to run for office in Idaho is Feb. 23-27. The primary election is May 19 and the general election is Nov. 3.

It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. – Back in early December, when Ole Miss had just promoted Pete Golding to head coach, I received a text message from a friend, a prominent Rebel alum, fan and donor. No, I won’t name him because he did not intend the message for public consumption.
But trust me, 99% of readers would recognize the name.
Rick Cleveland
My friend said he was “deeply troubled” by the hire. He called Golding “a scruffy-looking man with no head coaching experience who was let go as defensive coordinator by Nick Saban at Alabama.”
The writer said the Ole Miss defense had been average during the regular season against a relatively easy SEC schedule. Of Golding’s hire, he concluded: “I don’t like it a bit.”
Well, I did like the hire and wrote as much. This much I knew: Golding, a straight-shooting, down-to-earth guy, would be a refreshing change from his predecessor. But I also wrote that time would tell, that the biggest adjustment in sports was the promotion from assistant coach to head coach. There’s so much involved. Some can handle it, some can’t. 
Now then, here we are just over a month later at the Fiesta Bowl, the national championship semifinals. Granted, we are only one month into Golding’s head coaching career, but’s let’s assess. Here’s my Pete Golding report card:

Game management: A-plus. Ole Miss blew out Tulane, as expected, and then knocked off Georgia in the Sugar Bowl. The Rebels made offensive and defensive adjustments at halftime that were critical to victory.
Roster retention: A-plus-plus. Not only as Golding dealt with game preparation and hiring a staff, but in this insane era of college football, he has had to deal with the transfer portal and the potential loss of many of his best players. So far, he has lost only his back-up quarterback. Here lately, many of the Rebels’ best players (Trinidad Chambliss, Kewan Lacy, Lucas Carneiro, Suntarine Perkins, Will Echoles, Antonio Kite and others) have announced intentions to return. 
Dealing with the media: Another high A. Golding looks you in the eye and tells you what he thinks. He’s genuine. Yeah, he cusses some. So do I. So do most of us. As Golding has said, “Shit, I’m working on it.”
Gets along with others: A solid A. Ask his players, ask his coaches, ask his bosses, ask the equipment guys. They swear by him.
Recruiting: A. Nobody has ever questioned Golding’s recruiting ability. Besides retaining so many of the Rebels’ best players, Golding has Ole Miss easily in the top 10 nationally with the current transfer portal class. The Rebels have attracted players from LSU, Auburn, Florida and elsewhere.
Cussing: A big C. But, shit, he’s working on it.
Appearance: Another A. Amazing what a fresh haircut, a beard trim and new duds will do for you. Golding looked positively suave in his stylish navy blue suit Wednesday. He even wore a tie.

But don’t be fooled. A spiffed-up appearance has not changed who Golding is. “Pete’s Pete,” defensive coach Bryan Brown says. “He’s not gonna change. What you see is what you get.”
The following exchange from a Wednesday press conference will tell you much about Golding. 
Questioner: “What message do you have for Lane Kiffin and all those who maybe had given up or lost hope (after Kiffin left)?”
Golding: “I don’t have a message for anybody else. I think our team had a message. They had a message about how they prepared and how they play and that they weren’t tired of playing. I do think the message is: I’m replaceable. You’re replaceable. Our players are replaceable. I think you want to build a program to where it’s heading in the right direction. One person, one player, anything like that, that’s not going to derail that. There’s been too much invested in that; and it’s been aligned correctly, that one person is not going to impact something so drastically. If it is, it’s probably not built right, right? I
“If one coach in any sport can determine the outcome of it, he probably doesn’t have a very good staff, right? If one player can determine the outcome of it, we probably didn’t recruit and create the right depth. Or we didn’t prepare him to be ready for his opportunity. It’s a team game. There’s so many people that go into it. The timing of when it happened, in my opinion, couldn’t have happened at a better time for the players, because everything was already in place. Everything was on the track.
“It’s headed in the right direction. We have got really good players. There’s already a culture created. They knew the expectation. The only thing that was different is who is running them out of the tunnel. And to be honest with you, I don’t think the players give a damn who runs them out of the tunnel. Does that make sense? They care about their plan. They care about being held accountable and how they’re going to prepare. They care about people that care about them. I think that’s been the message our players have created. I don’t have shit to say to anybody else.”
Golding always deflects credit to his players and his staff – and even to the Ole Miss administration and supporters. If his predecessor was a narcissistic diva (and I wrote that he is), Golding is a polar opposite.

So, Wednesday morning, I reached back out to the prominent Ole Miss alum and donor who had been so troubled by Golding’s hiring just over a month ago.
What do you think now, I asked.
“Well, so far he’s proved me wrong,” he wrote back. “I don’t think anyone else could have put us in the advantageous spot we now find ourselves, what with excellent portal and high school recruiting, not to mention the national semifinals. And the players and the national press corps seem to love the man. Who am I to argue with success.”
Again, we are just over a month into Golding’s head coaching career. A lot could change. But, for Pete’s sake, the early returns are simply smashing.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/01212644/AP26002107624483.jpg,,,2026-01-07 18:59:33.401172

(Photo: Adobe file)The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services is not planning to change its 2015 list of recommended vaccinations for children up to 18.
On Jan. 5, the CDC announced changes to its recommendations for vaccines for children and adolescents, cutting the list from 17 to 11. Vaccines for RSV, hepatitis A and B, meningitis, COVID, rotavirus, and influenza are now recommended only for certain high-risk populations or after discussion with a doctor or nurse.
In its announcement, the CDC said the United States is a “global outlier” among developed countries for the number of vaccines it recommends.
“There is a need for more and better gold standard science, including placebo-controlled randomized trials and long-term observational studies to better characterize vaccine benefits, risks, and outcomes,” the agency said.
Speaking to reporters Wednesday, N.C. Division of Public Health director Dr. Kelly Kimple said the new CDC list is still similar to the state’s, including vaccines for measles, polio, chickenpox, tetanus, whooping cough and other diseases.
But Kimple said the state will follow the lead of the American Academy of Pediatrics, which is also declining to change its vaccine recommendations. She stressed that the AAP’s recommendations are “evidence-based.”
“I know that these changes are causing confusion, and we want to ensure people have clear, reliable information,” Kimple said. “The scientific evidence around the vaccines has not changed. These vaccines are safe and effective to prevent serious illness and death.”
“The important point to take away is that we continue to have vaccines available and covered by insurance to keep our kids, families and communities healthy and safe,” Kimple added.
State health officials also strongly urged North Carolinians to get a flu shot if they have not already, and to make sure their families’ MMR vaccines are up to date, especially if they’re traveling to an area with a known outbreak of measles.
Three siblings in Buncombe County have been diagnosed with measles after the family traveled to Spartanburg, South Carolina, where measles is currently spreading.
Dr. Erica Wilson with DHHS said the infected children had had one of their MMR series, but could not say if they were fully vaccinated. Another case of measles in Polk County is also believed to be connected to travel to South Carolina.
According to Kimple, a 2024 analysis found that childhood vaccines prevented around 508 million illnesses, 32 million hospitalizations, and more than 1.1 million premature deaths for U.S. children between 1994 and 2023. These estimates don’t include flu, COVID and RSV vaccines, she said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/AdobeStock-Vaccine-Equity.jpg,,,2026-01-07 18:12:23.464615

As Congress looks to create an alternative to the Affordable Care Act, or bow to pressure from constituents who will lose access to health care en masse by extending the premium tax credits that lapsed last month, U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib said she will continue the fight to do the latter.
Tlaib (D-Detroit) discussed the lapsed ACA tax credits in a press call hosted by Protect Our Care Michigan, which also featured Detroit City Councilwoman Mary Waters and Michigan League for Public Policy Senior Policy Analyst Amber Bellazaire.
The congresswoman continued to express her outrage at the U.S. House and Senate letting the subsidies lapse, and gave an update on how she and her Democratic colleagues are fighting back — which includes a forced floor vote set to take place on Thursday.
The federal subsidies in question were not renewed in President Donald Trump’s signature One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed last year. 
Tlaib said the act didn’t just tear away health care for tens of millions residents, but also cut Medicaid by nearly $1 trillion, which is a primary way that the nation helps pay for long-term care.
On the Michigan front, more than 531,000 Michiganders buy their health care through the ACA. 

The ACA open enrollment period to purchase health insurance closes on Jan. 15 for coverage starting Feb. 1, Protect Our Care Michigan has noted, and residents who buy health care through the ACA will be forced to pay $710 more each year on average for their health insurance. 
Roughly 390,000 Michiganders stand to lose their health care coverage due to premium increases in the bill that slashed $1.1 trillion from Medicaid. 
“Over 40% of births in Michigan are paid through Medicaid,” Tlaib said. “So as we’re fighting for Black maternal health to reduce infant mortality. We know how critically important it is to have access to health care coverage.”
She noted an anecdote from a constituent who told her that it wasn’t accurate to call America’s health system “health care” any longer, and that it was more akin to “sick care,” because the nation no longer prioritizes access to quality care. Tlaib said that was a basic right that has been shoved to the wayside in favor of Trump’s other priorities.
“I continue to remind people that if it was really about the money, Trump found money to bomb Venezuela, right? But he refuses to fund health care for Americans, many of which, again, are already sick,” she said. “The folks coming to testify at our press conferences here on the Hill and the Capitol steps talk about the fact that they have cancer now they can’t stop having cancer involved, and their care is interrupted because of the fact that we have not extended … the Affordable Care Act tax credits.”
Overall, Tlaib said she believes the American people do not want a bigger Pentagon budget, they want reasonable access to a doctor, and better yet, Medicare for all.

Tlaib said Democrats have zeroed in on one way to effectively fight back: a discharge petition that was jumpstarted in December, which forced a vote on the House floor expected Thursday.
Tlaib said it was a way to get around the Republican majority.
“If we can get 218 members of the House to sign it, then we can force a vote onto the floor,” Tlaib said. “Well, we got 218 signatures. We reached that, so now we’re going to be able to vote on it tomorrow. Democrats and at least four House Republicans will force a vote for a three-year tax credit extension for the Affordable Care Act.”
Tlaib asked constituents to continue to call their representatives to urge them to vote in favor of the extension, but said they didn’t need to call her, because she knows where she stands.
“I’m good to go. I signed that petition early on, but Republicans are breaking ranks right now because they are hearing directly from many of you and the constituents and what is at stake,” Tlaib said. “We must organize to pass this legislation tomorrow and put pressure on the Senate to take it up. Refuse to accept the status quo that treats health care as a privilege instead of a right. Lives are at stake right now.”
Waters and Bellazaire addressed the toll the lapsed credits may soon have on Michiganders if they aren’t extended this week or soon.
“No American should be forced to choose between getting the care they need to stay alive and losing their home and life savings to pay for cancer treatment,” said Waters, a cancer survivor. “President Trump and Republicans in Congress have a duty to put people’s health and safety first and foremost. Middle-class Michiganders will bear the burden of skyrocketing costs while billionaires get unfair tax breaks. Detroiters and all other Michiganders can’t afford higher costs on their health care premiums.”
Bellazaire said Congress has the opportunity to do the right thing this week.
“Renewing the enhanced premium tax credits would provide stability for the ACA marketplace, help families and small businesses manage rising costs, and ensure people can continue accessing the care they rely on,” Bellazaire said.

Free.,Dems demand investigation of fatal Minneapolis ICE shooting as Trump claims self-defense,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/dems-demand-investigation-fatal-minneapolis-ice-shooting-trump-claims-self-defense,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump defended a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer who fatally shot a woman in Minneapolis Wednesday, while congressional Democrats universally condemned the action.Video obtained by the Minnesota Reformer shows an ICE officer demanding the driver of a maroon SUV get out of the vehicle. As the vehicle begins to pull away, an officer fires three shots through the windshield and driver-side window. The video shows no apparent harm to the officer, who walked away from the vehicle shortly after the shooting. But Trump wrote on social media that “it is hard to believe he is alive.”“The woman driving the car was very disorderly, obstructing and resisting, who then violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self defense,” Trump wrote.Minnesota’s Democratic congressional delegation, and other Democrats in Washington, D.C., strongly condemned the incident and questioned the subsequent comments from the administration. “We need full transparency and an investigation of what happened, and I am deeply concerned that statements made by DHS do not appear to reflect video evidence and on-the-ground accounts,” Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar, the state’s senior senator, said in a statement.  Local officials have not identified the victim, but she was reportedly 37. A photo of the SUV shows several stuffed animals hanging out of the glove compartment.Trump, GOP back officerCongressional Republicans largely backed Trump’s version of events, calling the shooting self-defense and blaming Democrats for rhetoric they said inspired violence.Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said that the woman tried to run over the agent.“One of these violent rioters weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them—an act of domestic terrorism,” McLaughlin said. “An ICE officer, fearing for his life, the lives of his fellow law enforcement and the safety of the public, fired defensive shots.”Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem called the victim a “domestic terrorist.” House Republican Whip Tom Emmer gave his support to the ICE officer.“Our brave ICE agents put their lives on the line every day to protect our communities from dangerous criminals,” he said in a statement. “May God bless and protect them in their efforts. Shame on the elected officials who endanger these agents by spewing lies and hateful rhetoric.”Dems call for investigationDemocrats on Capitol Hill denounced the attack and the administration’s response.House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries called for the ICE officer who shot the woman to be criminally investigated. “There is no evidence that has been presented to justify this killing,” Jeffries, a New York Democrat, said in a statement. “Secretary Kristi Noem is a stone-cold liar and has zero credibility. The masked ICE agent who pulled the trigger should be criminally investigated to the full extent of the law for acting with depraved indifference to human life.”Minnesota Democrats said the ongoing immigration enforcement campaign in the Twin Cities had heightened tensions.“For weeks, Donald Trump has directed ICE and DHS agents to racially profile and arrest Minnesotans in their homes, their workplaces, and on our streets,” Minnesota Democratic Rep. Betty McCollum said in a statement, adding that more than 2,000 federal immigration agents are in the state. “Trump’s reckless and dangerous immigration policies do nothing to make us safer,” she continued. “Today in Minneapolis, these actions resulted in a masked federal agent fatally shooting a woman in the head.”Democratic Sen. Tina Smith said the woman fatally shot by an ICE officer was a U.S. citizen. She called for ICE to leave Minnesota. Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar, the first Somali-American woman elected to Congress and whose district includes the site of the shooting, said the woman was a legal observer, which is a neutral third party who attends protests or other public demonstrations to observe and record law enforcement actions towards protesters.“ICE’s actions today were unconscionable and reprehensible,” Omar said.DHS practices, budget questionedDHS received billions for immigration enforcement in last year's tax and spending cuts package passed by congressional Republicans. The funding can be used for hiring new ICE officers and detention and removal of immigrants. On Jan. 3, ICE announced it hired 12,000 new officers, doubling from 10,000 agents to 22,000.A top Senate Democratic appropriator, Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, wrote on social media that “Democrats cannot vote for a DHS budget that doesn’t restrain the growing lawlessness of this agency.” New Jersey Democratic Sen. Cory Booker said in a statement that he was concerned the aggressive DHS practices will lead to more tragedies. “All evidence indicates that hiring standards have been lowered, training is inadequate, and internal controls are insufficient,” he said. “These conditions have allowed agents to operate without proper oversight, and, in some cases, unlawfully.” Arizona Sen. Ruben Gallego also criticized the hiring practices of ICE, specifically calling out White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, a lead architect of the Trump administration's immigration policy.  “What happened is a disgrace and we need an investigation immediately,” Gallego said on social media. “It's clear that that agent didn't have the proper training, and that's because Stephen Miller is going full speed ahead to hire as many agents as possible.”Day care investigationThe federal immigration operation in Minneapolis began last month but intensified this week after a right-wing influencer reported day care centers run by members of the Somali community as fraudulent. In response, the Trump administration directed states to provide “justification” that federal child care funds they receive are spent on “legitimate” providers and Noem has zeroed in on the city, which has a large Somali community, for immigration enforcement. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee held a Wednesday hearing on the issue of fraud in Minnesota.",,,,2026-01-07 17:59:13.473300

(Foto de Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Un agente del ICE disparó mortalmente a una mujer que conducía un SUV a través de la ventanilla de su coche en el sur de Minneapolis el miércoles por la mañana.
El vídeo del incidente compartido con The Reformer muestra agentes enmascarados de ICE acercándose a un Honda Pilot detenido en medio de Portland Avenue, cerca de la calle 34. Un agente le dice al conductor que “salga del maldito coche” e intenta abrir la puerta. El conductor retrocede lentamente y avanza, pareciendo que intenta salir. Un agente que va delante del vehículo dispara tres veces y el SUV recorre una corta distancia antes de chocar contra un coche aparcado.
La mujer fue trasladada al Centro Médico del Condado de Hennepin, donde fue declarada muerta, según el jefe de policía de Minneapolis. La identidad de la mujer aún no ha sido revelada, solo que tenía 37 años, según el alcalde de Minneapolis.
Tricia McLaughlin, subsecretaria del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional, escribiendo en X, dio una versión diferente de lo ocurrido: “Uno de estos alborotadores violentos convirtió su vehículo en arma, intentando atropellar a nuestros agentes de la ley en un intento de matarlos: un acto de terrorismo doméstico. Un agente de ICE, temiendo por su vida, la de sus compañeros de policía y la seguridad del público, disparó tiros defensivos.”
La testigo que grabó el vídeo, Caitlin Callenson, dijo que estaba paseando cuando vio un vehículo de combustión interna atascado en la nieve. A medida que llegaban más vehículos de combustión interna, los transeúntes silbataban en señal de protesta y el conductor del SUV intentaba bloquear los vehículos de combustión interna.
Callenson dijo que no vio agentes de ICE intentando detener a nadie antes o después del tiroteo.
Después de que se dispararon los disparos, el conductor “quedó completamente desplomado dentro del vehículo”, dijo Emily Heller, otra testigo.
Los agentes federales no permitirían que un hombre que decía ser médico examinara al conductor, dijo Heller. Los técnicos de emergencia médica llegaron 15 minutos después, dijo. Los primeros intervinientes no pudieron acercarse al lugar porque los agentes de ICE no movieron sus coches para dejarles pasar.
“Hubo caos y ambulancias y camiones de bomberos no pudieron pasar”, dijo Callenson. “Tuvieron que recorrer todos los vehículos ICE a pie para intentar administrar primeros auxilios.”
El alcalde de Minneapolis, Jacob Frey, dijo que temía este momento desde que el Departamento de Seguridad Nacional comenzó a intensificar la aplicación de la ley migratoria en las Ciudades Gemelas en las últimas semanas, enviando miles de agentes al estado en lo que el Departamento de Seguridad Nacional califica como su “mayor operación hasta la fecha”.
Frey calificó el informe de ICE, que dijo que el tiroteo fue en defensa propia, de “tonterías” y criticó duramente la presencia de la agencia en la ciudad, afirmando que solo “están causando caos y desconfianza”.
“A ICE, lárgate de Minneapolis”, dijo Frey.
Instó a los residentes a mantener la paz y a no “caer en el anzuelo” del gobierno federal.
“Quieren que respondamos de una manera que cree una ocupación militar en nuestra ciudad”, dijo Frey. “No dejemos que lo hagan.”
Decenas de agentes federales de ICE y del FBI, así como agentes de policía de Minneapolis y agentes del sheriff del condado de Hennepin, acudieron al lugar.
Mientras los agentes de ICE abandonaban el lugar, el enfrentamiento entre las fuerzas del orden y los manifestantes continuaba.
Cuando algunos agentes federales intentaron marcharse, los manifestantes bloquearon sus vehículos. Los agentes dispararon un gas nocivo a corta distancia, causando angustia y vómitos en muchos manifestantes y periodistas
Los manifestantes lanzaron insultos a los agentes de policía de Minneapolis, que no deberían ayudar en la aplicación de la ley migratoria, pero que estaban en el lugar el miércoles por la mañana.
Después de que las fuerzas del orden desalojaran el lugar, los manifestantes colocaron rosas blancas donde la sangre manchaba la nieve.

Miembros del Ayuntamiento, entre ellos Robin Wonsley y Jamal Osman, se dirigieron a la multitud, diciendo que la zona era una escena activa del crimen y que la policía de MPD estaba presente para investigar.
El jefe de policía de Minneapolis, Brian O’Hara, dijo en una rueda de prensa el miércoles que aún no han visto información que indique que el tiroteo estuviera justificado y que no hay nada que indique que la mujer fuera objetivo de actividades de aplicación de la ley migratoria, según O’Hara.
Los agentes de policía de Minneapolis aseguraron la escena del crimen para preservar pruebas, dijo O’Hara. La Oficina Federal de Investigaciones está llevando a cabo conjuntamente una investigación sobre el uso de la fuerza letal con la Oficina de Detención Criminal de Minnesota.
La sheriff del condado de Hennepin, Dawanna Witt, subrayó la necesidad de la implicación local en la investigación para garantizar la transparencia: “Con todo respeto al nivel federal, debemos asegurarnos de que nuestras agencias locales estén implicadas.”
La fiscal del condado de Hennepin, Mary Moriarty, emitió un comunicado poco después del tiroteo diciendo: “Presionando con fuerza para una investigación local, que es la única forma de garantizar total transparencia y revisión por parte de nuestra oficina.”
La representante estadounidense Betty McCollum, demócrata de St. Paul, pidió a la secretaria de Seguridad Nacional, Kristi Noem, que se filmara observando las acciones de ICE en Minneapolis el martes, para que detuviera inmediatamente la operación de ICE “para restaurar el orden y prevenir más lesiones”.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_7010-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-07 17:59:13.473300

Many still fear future restrictions on access and are working with the Legislature to safeguard Vermont’s ability to buy and administer the vaccines to those who want and need them.

The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scaled back federal guidelines for childhood vaccines Monday, moving six immunizations out of the “recommended” category. Following the federal action, Vermont officials and health experts are reaffirming the state’s commitment to its existing childhood immunization schedule, which recommends many of the vaccines that the CDC had removed.
The vaccines for flu, RSV, meningococcal disease and hepatitis A and B were among the vaccines removed from the federal recommended category. In Vermont, they remain recommended or required for child care or school attendance.
The move is the latest in a series of efforts led by U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is an outspoken skeptic of vaccines, to move away from established medical science on immunization.

“In Vermont, vaccine policy will continue to be guided by scientific evidence and informed by trusted medical organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics,” state Health Commissioner Rick Hildebrant wrote in a statement Tuesday. 
“As always, we encourage families to consult trusted health care professionals when making decisions about their children’s health, including their pediatrician, school nurse, or local pharmacist. We also urge caution when sharing or acting on unverified or misleading health information,” his statement continued. 
On Tuesday, he appeared before the Vermont House of Representatives’ Committee on Human Services to address the federal change and to testify about a proposed state bill that aims to protect access to vaccines for those who want and need them in Vermont. 
Hildebrant confirmed to lawmakers that the cost of and access to childhood vaccines has not changed with the federal recommendation shift — insurers are still required to cover the costs of these vaccines. But the Health Department is still taking steps to prepare for a future where that is no longer the case as federal policy under President Donald Trump’s administration continues to change.
“We are very concerned about what this could look like in the future,” he said, adding that he worries this change is “setting the stage” for more drastic restrictions on access to vaccines. 
He said the Health Department is working to proactively safeguard vaccine access in Vermont. The proposed bill H.545 is one path it is taking to do so. 
Currently, the state buys vaccines from the CDC, which buys the vaccines from manufacturers in bulk and is able to offer lower prices. Yet, earlier in the fall, this reliance on the federal body led to delays in the state’s ability to procure the Covid-19 vaccines.
The bill also includes clearer guidelines for the state’s immunization recommendation processes, relying on a committee of local experts, not just federal vaccine panels. It adds details to ensure insurers will continue covering the cost of vaccination and to offer legal immunity for providers who administer the vaccines in good faith, following broadly agreed upon medical science. 
Tracy Tyson is a pediatrician and the president-elect of Vermont’s chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics. She told lawmakers in Tuesday’s hearing that her organization sees Vermont as setting an important example by solidifying its own state vaccine schedule separate from federal recommendations.
Those at American Academy of Pediatrics “see Vermont as a trailblazer in protecting the relationship between public health, its providers and its patients,” she said. 
She still worries there is serious harm in the current landscape of shifting federal guidelines. Even though children can still get the vaccines and insurance will cover them, the confusion that many parents face about what protections their child should receive and when is dangerous, she said. It hinders “true, informed consent,” Tyson told lawmakers. 
“It may seem like it’s giving more autonomy to families, but what it’s giving is more confusion, and that is going to lead to more lapses in care,” she said of the altered vaccine schedule.  
Many health care providers across the state have echoed the state Health Department in reaffirming the safety of the previous CDC vaccine schedule.
“This schedule is grounded in rigorous science and the expertise of immunologists, infectious disease specialists, and public health professionals,” Dartmouth Health Children’s chief physician Keith Loud wrote in a statement, referring to the previous guidelines. The children’s hospital will continue to root its recommendations in the American Academy of Pediatrics schedule. 
The Vermont Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, Vermont Academy of Family Physicians and the Vermont Medical Society issued a joint statement echoing the importance of these vaccines. 
They are important not only for children’s health, Hildebrandt added in his address to the House committee, but it is also a massive cost-saving tool for the health care system. 
“The reason we use vaccines is to prevent expensive and deadly illnesses,” he said, giving the example of a $10 flu shot that could prevent a child from landing in the emergency room or intensive care unit, wracking up hundreds of thousands of dollars in medical bills. 
“The data on vaccines is a slam dunk. These are cost saving, not cost generating,” he said.

Trump appointed Shepherd to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Arkansas, which includes 34 of Arkansas’ 75 counties and most of the 13th Judicial District with the exceptions of Cleveland and Dallas counties.
If confirmed by the U.S. Senate, Shepherd will succeed U.S. District Judge Susan Hickey, who has held the position since 2010.
“John brings a wealth of experience to his new role,” Trump wrote in a TruthSocial post. “He will be a bold Advocate for Law and Order, and a tireless Champion of our Great Constitution.”
Shepherd graduated from Rice University with a bachelor’s degree in political science in 2009 and received his law degree from the University of Arkansas School of Law in 2013, according to the website for the Shepherd & Shepherd law firm. He was a partner at the firm alongside his brother, former state House Speaker Rep. Matthew Shepherd, a Republican.
Their father is Judge Bobby Shepherd of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis. He was nominated to the court in 2006 by then-President George W. Bush.

Why his case shows new legal obstacles for immigrants,Wendy Fry,,,,,https://calmatters.org/justice/2026/01/san-diego-immigration-release-courts/,"An immigration judge granted Idris Demirtas' release from detention, but that wasn't enough to reunite him with his wife in San Diego.","In summary
An immigration judge granted Idris Demirtas’ release from detention, but that wasn’t enough to reunite him with his wife in San Diego. 


A Turkish immigrant who fled his country after being tortured is now home with his wife in San Diego after being held for about seven weeks by U.S. authorities. 
Idris Demirtas, 25, was released only after a federal judge in the Southern District of California granted a habeas corpus petition finding that his detention was unjustified. An immigration judge issued a decision in Demirtas’ favor a week earlier, but she made the ruling contingent on a federal court process. 
His arrest at a routine immigration check-in and his 48-day detention reflected some of the Trump administration’s hardline enforcement tactics since the Republican took office a year ago pledging to deport 1 million people per year.
“I did grow a lot through this process, but we lost a lot emotionally and mentally,” said Mae Bovenzi, Demirtas’ wife. “I hope both of our mental health goes back to normal. I feel like we’ve been so misinformed and I’ve seen the constitutional rights that are being stripped away right in front of my eyes.” 
The couple, who married in May, missed their first holiday season together because of the ordeal but they plan to “celebrate in their own way now,” his wife said. She added she was grateful for all the support her family received.
“My body didn’t want to go to sleep last night because I’m afraid I’ll dream I’m back there in jail,” Demirtas said about his first night home.  
Demirtas was arrested on Nov. 20 when he complied with an order to appear at a routine ICE check-in in San Diego at the downtown federal Edward Schwartz courthouse. 
He was among hundreds who were arrested in California last year while appearing at immigration check-ins or court hearings. His background would have made his detention improbable during the Biden administration. He is married to a U.S. citizen and has a pending green card application. He does not have any criminal history, a Department of Homeland Security attorney confirmed during a bond hearing last week. He’s from a country with a human rights record that the State Department has criticized and he arrived in the United States after fleeing religious persecution. He said in court filings he was tortured in Turkey because of his religious beliefs.
Despite that background, and an immigration judge ruling he could be released on bond on Dec. 30, Demirtas remained detained at the Otay Mesa Detention Center until the district judge granted his habeas petition and he was released Tuesday night. 
Attorneys are increasingly turning to federal courts to secure their clients’ release because of disruptions to the immigration court system. The Trump administration has fired more than 100 immigration judges nationwide, according to the National Association of Immigration Judges. 
In California, more than a quarter of federal immigration judges have been fired, retired or quit since Trump’s inauguration in January 2025.  In San Francisco, at least 12 immigration judges have been fired or left without clear explanations, exacerbating a 100,000-case backlog in the region it covers. 
A spokesperson for the Executive Office for Immigration Review, which oversees the courts, said her office declines to comment on personnel matters.
‘Unforgiving system’
In July 2025, the Trump administration issued a directive that required mandatory detention for almost all noncitizens who entered the United States without authorization. 
“Based on how unforgiving the immigration system is right now, great people are just giving up,” said Matthew Holt, Demirtas’ immigration attorney. “It’s sad to see it after the generational sacrifices they’ve made.”
Holt and other attorneys have said the new system of detaining more people, and not letting them out on bond or parole is like a “war of attrition,” a military strategy where one side wears the other down by exhausting their resources and morale.
In September, some 7,079 immigration court cases nationwide ended with a voluntary departure, which allows a person to leave the country within a certain time frame and usually carries less penalties than a deportation order. That’s the highest number ever recorded in a single month, according to data from Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, which holds information on cases going back to 1997. For cases in California, that total was 408. 
“I personally have experienced people with meritorious claims, or what could be meritorious claims, before the hearing, before their testimony, say, ‘I want an order of removal. I want to leave. I can’t take it anymore,'” said Jeremiah Johnson, a former immigration judge in San Francisco, who was fired on Nov. 21 by email without explanation. 
Federal judges rule against detention
A spokesperson for the Department of Justice declined to comment. Previously, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin stressed that Demirtas had entered the country illegally. 
“To be clear, having a pending application with USCIS or the possibility of being eligible for a green card does not grant anyone legal status,” McLaughlin said about the case. 
A Department of Homeland Security budget document from 2024 says it costs on average $217 per day for ICE to detain someone in San Diego, meaning U.S. taxpayers paid about $10,416 for Demirtas to be detained before the agency finally agreed to release him. 
Before President Donald Trump’s second term, the federal lawsuits known as “habeas corpus” were not regularly used in immigration cases. “Habeas corpus” is the constitutional right that ensures that people have a chance to challenge their imprisonment in front of a judge.
In 2025, hundreds of habeas cases were filed in the Southern District of California, and thousands were filed for detained immigrants across the country. So far in 2026, about a dozen such cases have already been filed in the Southern District of California, according to habeasdockets.org, a site that tracks such filings. 
Federal judges have been systematically rejecting Trump’s policy of mandatory detention. In one recent filing in the Southern District of New York, U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan noted noncitizens have won their habeas petitions in 350 of 362 cases in federal district courts. He wrote that “160 different judges sitting in about 50 different courts spread across the United States” handed down the rulings.
New postings for ‘deportation judges’
Immigration courts operate underneath the executive branch, not the independent judicial branch that oversees federal courts. The courts are housed under the Justice Department, which gives the Trump administration more authority over immigration judges. Unlike in criminal courts, attorneys are not appointed for those who cannot afford legal representation.
The Department of Justice recently began advertising open positions for “deportation judges,” particularly for employees located in San Francisco, Santa Ana, Sacramento and Los Angeles where applicants are invited to “combat fraud and ensure those seeking to exploit vulnerabilities in our immigration system are not successful.” 
A Department of Justice spokesperson said the effort was aimed at “restoring integrity to our immigration system.” 
“After four years of the Biden Administration forcing immigration courts to implement a de facto amnesty for hundreds of thousands of aliens, this Department of Justice is restoring integrity to our immigration system and encourages talented legal professionals to join in our mission to protect national security and public safety,” she wrote in an emailed statement. 
The Trump administration has also temporarily assigned military lawyers to act as judges in immigration cases, which some experts say could violate posse comitatus, the 19th Century law that defines what the military can do on U.S. soil.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/010525-Idris-Demirtas-CM-02.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-07 17:59:13.473300

Greg Walker is reversing his decision to retire from the Indiana Legislature, citing the political turmoil from the congressional redistricting debate.","Sen. Greg Walker, R-Columbus, speaks during an Indiana Senate session in April 2025 . (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Republican Sen. Greg Walker is reversing his decision to retire from the Indiana Legislature, citing the political turmoil from the congressional redistricting debate.
Walker, R-Columbus, had announced last summer that he wouldn’t seek reelection to the Senate seat he first won in 2006 but on Wednesday filed for another term on the first day of the candidacy filing period.
Walker told the Indiana Capital Chronicle that “circumstances are different” from when he previously decided to not run again.
“I felt like it was important for me to continue to stand for Indiana issues instead of Washington politics,” Walker said in an interview. “We’ve seen just a small taste of what federalization of Indiana elections could look like, and may eventually look more like than they do today, and I’m greatly concerned when I see Hoosier politics play a surrogate to those national battles.” 
Walker was a vocal Republican critic of the redistricting plan pushed by President Donald Trump — and was one of several lawmakers who faced swatting or other intimidation tactics ahead of the Senate’s vote last month against redrawing the congressional maps.
Rep. Michelle Davis, R-Whiteland, is among the Republicans who had announced bids to succeed Walker in Senate District 41, which includes all of Bartholomew County and much of Johnson County south of Indianapolis.
Davis, who voted in favor of the redistricting plan when it passed the House, said Wednesday she was continuing her Senate campaign.
Rep. Michelle Davis, R-Whiteland, speaks before the House Education Committee in 2025. (Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
“It does not affect me one bit,” Davis told the Capital Chronicle. “I’ve worked really hard, spent a lot of time in both Johnson County and Bartholomew County, gaining support, holding fundraisers and showing up at events. I am full-force steam ahead.”
Trump, Gov. Mike Braun and pro-redistricting groups have said they would support primary challengers to Republican legislators who didn’t support the proposed new maps that sought a 9-0 GOP Indiana congressional delegation by carving up the two districts now held by Democrats.
Walker said he didn’t know how redistricting supporters might try to insert themselves into his race.
“I’ve seen a lot of implied or explicit threats or implied or explicit rewards, but I don’t see a lot of evidence on follow through from outside forces,” Walker said.
Walker delivered more than 20 minutes of emotional remarks during a December committee hearing on the redistricting bill — at one point moved to tears — explaining why he could not support it.
“I fear for this institution … if we allow intimidation and threats to be the norm,” he said. “I refuse to be intimidated. I will not normalize that kind of behavior.”
Walker has broken from other Republican senators on some prominent issues in recent years, such as voting against the 2022 bill that revoked Indiana’s handgun permit requirement and last year’s bill allowing partisan school board elections.
He also voted against a 2022 bill sponsored by Davis that banned transgender youths from competing in girls school sports.
Davis supported all those bills and said “key differences” in their voting records would be a campaign issue.
“We’re opposite a lot on some voting issues that are core Republican values,” she said. “I will always vote for morals and for what the Hoosier families believe in.”
The 62-year-old Walker said his wife’s 2023 death had him reevaluating what to do, but that he now had a new resolve.
“I’m not too sure this isn’t to my own hurt to do this,” he said. “It’s just that I think that needs to be done.”",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/P4151345-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-07 17:59:13.473300

MONTPELIER—Vermont lawmakers in the early days of the 2026 legislative session are trying to keep the education reforms started last session on track.
But the efforts appear on shaky ground after the state’s school redistricting task force refused to deliver a map of proposed consolidated school districts in November. Without a map of consolidated school districts, uncertainty has only grown in the six months since Gov. Phil Scott signed Act 73, the law setting the state on a course to radically transform how public schools are paid for and governed.
“I think that it is going to be very hard to get broad agreement on mandated consolidation,” said Rep. Peter Conlon, D-Cornwall, the chair of the House Education Committee. “This is a pretty difficult situation.”

Scott devoted his State of the State address on Wednesday to rallying support for Act 73 and further education reforms, telling House and Senate members that the issue remains Vermont’s “most critical challenge.”
“Education transformation is not optional, it’s essential,” he said.
Legislative leaders, Conlon included, said they are intent on working toward reform. Other lawmakers say there is a path forward to create a new education finance formula, even if lawmakers cannot agree on consolidation.
Conlon’s counterpart in the Senate agrees. 
“We have a system now (where) really nobody’s responsible, and it’s resulting in people not being able to pay their property taxes,” said Sen. Seth Bongartz, D-Bennington, the chair of the Senate Education Committee. “We must fix the system.”
And while legislators try to push forward with long-term changes, Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Baruth, D/P-Chittenden Central, says he plans on introducing legislation Thursday to cap spending in Vermont’s school districts in the near term.
“If we’re going to get ourselves out of this situation where the General Fund is being eaten by the (Education) Fund, we have to have some hard stop on this kind of explosive growth,” Baruth said.
‘Everything’s on the table’
Lawmakers in the Senate and House education committees have spent their first two days brushing up on the intricacies of Act 73, as well as reviewing various reports from groups trying to map the future of public education.
“This is going to be a hard session for us,” Conlon told committee members Tuesday. “We are going to enter it with a philosophy of everything’s on the table.”
A joint meeting of the House and Senate education committees is scheduled for Thursday to discuss the redistricting task force’s final report.
Task force members called for lawmakers to instead create five cooperative education service regions, regional entities that would allow the 119 existing school districts to share resources for things such as special education and transportation.
Scott panned the task force’s proposal, and in his address Wednesday said their failure to produce a map proposal was “a political strategy to preserve the old system.”
Still, some lawmakers feel the task force’s proposal should be considered as lawmakers forge ahead in the coming weeks.
“They lay out a very different path forward, and it’s something that we’re going to need to take a very hard look at, given Vermonters’ very mixed reaction to the idea of mandated consolidation,” Conlon said in an interview.

‘This is a pretty difficult situation’
The heart of Act 73 is a planned shift to a foundation formula, a funding model used by most states in the country that would realign authority over school district budgets away from school districts and to the state.
Currently, school districts are allowed broad latitude in deciding how much to spend. With a foundation formula, the state would set a base funding amount per student and adjust for students requiring more support, shifting significant decision-making authority from local districts to the state. 
The new formula would help contain growing education costs, and consolidating districts is key to shifting to the new formula, Agency of Education officials have said previously.
But without a proposed map in front of them, lawmakers said consolidating school districts is a tall task.
“I think that it is going to be very hard to get broad agreement on mandated consolidation,” Conlon said. “This is a pretty difficult situation.”
During his speech, Scott said drawing new district lines “should be the first order of business for the committees of jurisdiction.”
Bongartz, meanwhile, said that while the task force “obviously set the process back,” lawmakers will have to find a new starting point.
“It’s just going to take letting the committee gel a little bit around this, taking a lot of testimony early, and trying to figure out the vehicle for getting to that repair or rewrite of the funding formula that we know has to happen,” Bongartz said.
In the meantime, lawmakers are at work figuring out how to keep rising property taxes under control.
Scott, in his initial budget proposal, said he plans on using $75 million in unused funds from this year’s state budget to dampen an expected 12% average property tax increase. That spike is driven in part by a projected $115 million increase in education spending next year.
“While it goes against the grain and doesn’t actually fix the problem we’re trying to solve, I’ll be asking you to provide some property tax relief with another band-aid,” Scott said during his State of the State address.
Buying down property taxes has become commonplace in recent years. Scott and lawmakers last year allocated more than $100 million to keep the average property tax bill nearly flat.
Even with the cash injections, average education property taxes have risen more than 40% across the state in the last five years, according to the Vermont Tax Department.
Baruth, the Senate’s leader, said he’s generally supportive of Scott’s plan to use money to buy down the education fund this year, but said it must be contingent on efforts to cap school districts’ spending.
To that end, Baruth said he plans on introducing legislation on Thursday that would set a cap on school districts budgets beginning in 2028 and 2029, based on a district’s previous year’s spending.
Scott has signalled some support for the idea. But other Democratic lawmakers have expressed skepticism over the plan.

After months of debate, public hearings and private negotiations, Mississippi House Speaker Jason White unveiled his massive bill to reshape public education and provide more school choice on Wednesday. 
The sprawling 553-page bill, titled the “Mississippi Education Freedom Act” or “House Bill 2,” includes a wide range of provisions. The legislation would direct some taxpayer funds to private schools, ease public school transfer regulations, make it easier to open charter schools statewide and expand the literacy act that helped lead Mississippi to nationally noted success in student literacy. 
READ MORE: Mississippi school-choice battle begins: House unveils omnibus plan. Senate wants teacher raise, opposes vouchers
The bill does not include a broad teacher pay raise, unlike a Senate bill passed earlier Wednesday. A teacher pay raise could emerge as a bargaining chip between the chambers. The House measure would raise assistant teacher minimum pay from $17,000 a year to $20,000.
The Senate is passing separate school bills rather than one large one like the House’s. The Senate’s approach focuses on loosening regulations around public school transfer and would not create a voucher system that allows parents to use taxpayer funds for private school tuition. 
In a social media post, White said the bill would build on recent gains in Mississippi’s education rankings and be a long-term investment in the state’s economy.
“HB 2 ensures that all Mississippi families, regardless of income or zip code, have real choices and the freedom to pursue what works best for their children, while prioritizing low- and middle-income families,” White said. “HB 2 also expands educational opportunities by removing barriers to high-quality public school options while fully preserving local school boards’ decision-making power to accept students who want to transfer from other districts.”
Here are some of the bill’s highlights:

Allows parents to use taxpayer funds to pay for private school tuition. This would be done by creating “Magnolia Student Accounts” (MSAs) for eligible students. Students would be eligible if they reside in Mississippi and are enrolled in the state’s K-12 education system. Schools that could participate include nonpublic schools that have been accredited and have educated students for at least four years. It would pay for these accounts by creating an “Education Freedom Fund” in the state Treasury, which would be funded by legislative appropriation. The MSAs would first be prioritized for students from families whose income is less than 100% of the area median income. Then it would extend to students whose household income is less than 200% of the area’s median income, followed by students from households with less than 300% of the area’s median income. After that, it would extend to all students regardless of income. In the program’s first year, the 2027-28 academic year, 12,500 scholarships would be available. By the program’s fourth year, that number would grow to 20,000. House leaders have not publicly provided a detailed estimate of the cost of the school choice and other proposals in the new bill, but House Education Chairman Rob Roberson said Wednesday that the vouchers would likely be about $7,000 each, the base cost the state now pays for public school students. Providing private school vouchers for 12,500 students, as the bill proposes, would cost $87.5 million.


Loosens regulations on public school transfers. The bill would remove the ability of school districts to stop a student from transferring to another public school district. Mississippi already has a limited version of this policy, commonly called “portability.” Under current law, the school board of a student’s home district must provide consent for the release of the student. House Bill 2 would change this, effectively shifting authority from the student’s home district to the receiving district. Transfers would be subject to the capacity of receiving districts to accept new students and are not to conflict with court desegregation orders. Student transfer requests must be approved by the receiving district’s school board in no more than 60 days. If transfers are denied because of lack of capacity, the bill requires districts to use lotteries and to maintain waitlists. The bill directs districts to publish capacity data, application timelines and the procedures used to choose transfer students in advance of the school year — a measure aimed at transparency, House leaders said. The Senate has passed its own portability plan to try to ease public school transfers.


Allow charter schools to open in any school district. The bill authorizes charter schools “within the geographical boundaries of any school district. Current state laws only allow charter schools to open without local school board approval in school districts with a D- or F-rating. Under the new bill, charter school applicants would no longer need a local school board’s endorsement in A-, B- or C-rated districts. The legislation would also alter the membership of the Mississippi Charter School Authorizer Board. Membership would increase from seven to nine members, and one appointment would be reserved for Accelerate Mississippi, a pro-school choice organization. 


Expand the literacy act that helped lead to Mississippi’s national success in reading. In 2013, lawmakers focused financial and classroom support to teaching students in kindergarten through third grade how to read. The state established a third-grade reading test that students are required to pass to advance to the next grade. Experts say that legislation contributed hugely to the state’s subsequent reading gains that garnered national attention. The House’s package expands targeted literacy initiatives to grades 4 through 8. The reading gains have been dubbed the “Mississippi Miracle” by state leaders and education policy pundits. 
School district consolidation. The bill would consolidate the Copiah County and Hazlehurst City school districts, abolishing the former districts and creating a single new district effective July 1, 2028. But Roberson, the House Education Chairman, told Mississippi Today this approach could be used as a model for future district consolidations. The potential for school closures as a result of district consolidation has been a fear cited by many parents in rural areas. House Bill 2 says it would not require school closures even if the districts that govern these schools are abolished.

Both chambers of the Mississippi Legislature are dominated by Republicans, but some GOP members from areas such as Rankin County near Jackson and DeSoto County in northwest Mississippi have previously rejected school choice, largely citing opposition to educating students whose families don’t pay property taxes in the districts they would attend school. Democrats mostly oppose school choice, arguing the policies would siphon funds from the public school system and particularly away from schools in low-income areas.
The House education package included numerous other provisions that lawmakers and Capitol observers were reviewing on Wednesday. The House Education Committee, which met Wednesday, did not take up the omnibus education bill. Instead, the panel of representatives invited a group of parents who were almost all in favor of school choice to speak at a hearing.

Spencer Cox speaks during a news conference introducing a bell-to-bell cellphone ban in public schools on Jan. 7, 2026. (Alixel Cabrera/Utah News Dispatch)Last fall Utah students had a taste of a statewide cellphone ban during classroom hours. But, the law that an overwhelming majority of the Legislature voted to pass last year doesn’t go far enough, Gov. Spencer Cox said. 
That effort, he said, won’t be finished until smart devices are prohibited during the whole school day, including lunch periods, transition times between classes, and recess. So, when the Utah Legislature convenes on Jan. 20, South Jordan Republican Sen. Lincoln Fillmore will be taking another look at the cellphone ban bill he passed last year and incorporating Cox’s feedback.
“We have an opportunity to fix what we got wrong last time and do it the right way this time. I am convinced more than ever that a bell-to-bell cellphone ban is the single most important thing that we can do for our students in our schools today,” Cox said during a news conference promoting Fillmore’s new bill on Wednesday.

Under the current law, public schools in Utah have a default cellphone ban policy for students during class time. However, administrators have the power to implement rules that can be either more flexible or stricter for devices. That’s something that Fillmore’s 2026 bill won’t change. 
“I am not aware of a single school district, even though they have the power to do so, who have gone less than what the state law requires them to do,” Fillmore said. “But I am aware of a lot of individual schools and school districts who have stepped farther.”
Some schools already have a bell-to-bell cellphone ban, including Granger High in West Valley City, which established the rule in 2024. According to Cox, a principal in one of those schools reported higher attendance rates, better test scores and fewer bullying incidents.
Cox applauds bills taking aim at ‘destructive’ apps and cellphones

It is up to schools to provide storage solutions for phones, Fillmore said. Some have invested in magnetic locking pouches, while others have required students to simply keep their devices in their backpacks. 
“There are all kinds of workable solutions here at various costs, and I think it’s appropriate to let those decisions be made at the local school district,” he said.
For Cox, who has campaigned to reduce social media usage and increase regulations on tech companies, this is “an easy call,” he said. Especially with the rise of artificial intelligence.  
“If we thought it wasn’t a fair fight with the social media companies, the fight is going to completely overwhelm us with AI chatbots and their ability to not just rewire our brains, but hijack everything that makes us human,” he said. “And we can’t allow that to happen in our schools.”



Let us know what you think...


 


Describing devices and social media as addictive, Cox added that it is a mistake to not understand “the destructive power of these devices.” School cellphone policies, he added, are tied to the conservative principle to collectively protect children “against these harms that are debasing them.” 
Avery Gonzales, who advocated for the 2025 law during her senior year in Cache County, was also at the news conference with representatives from The Policy Project, a nonprofit in the state that has backed the cellphone ban effort. 
While Gonzales remembers her peers being upset at her for standing by the rule, she said many had a change of heart when they realized the effects their phones had on their connections with classmates.
“Instead of scrolling alone, they are talking, laughing and finally building real friendships,” she said. “A bell-to-bell approach would strengthen the positive results we are already seeing today. This approach creates consistency and clarity. It allows students to fully disconnect from their screens and fully reconnect with learning and with each other.”

This story was originally reported by Orion Rummler of The 19th.  Meet Orion and read more of their reporting on gender, politics and policy.
Three children’s hospitals are under federal investigation for providing gender-affirming care to transgender youth, as the Trump administration continues to use all the levers it can to block such care.
Health and Human Services (HHS) General Counsel Mike Stuart has referred three children’s hospitals to the agency’s inspector general’s office: Seattle Children’s Hospital, Children’s Hospital Colorado, and Children’s Minnesota. Gender-affirming care for trans youth is legal in all three states. But HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. last month announced that medical practitioners who provide gender-affirming care to minors are out of compliance with federal health care standards. Now, the agency is enforcing that declaration.
In response, Children’s Hospital Colorado has reportedly paused gender-affirming care for trans youth. Children’s Minnesota did not respond to a request for comment, and its website states that “at this time, our gender health services remain unchanged.” Seattle Children’s hospital also did not respond.
Another hospital, Denver Health, has also paused gender-affirming care for trans youth since Kennedy’s declaration, although the hospital does not appear to be under investigation.
In earlier efforts by Trump administration officials to investigate and halt  gender-affirming care, both Children’s Hospital Colorado and Seattle Children’s Hospital successfully fought back against Justice Department subpoenas seeking trans patients’ medical information.
The administration previously pressured hospitals to halt gender-affirming care by threatening to revoke federal funding, which worked in many cases, but these HHS investigations mark a new escalation. They stem from Kennedy saying that, under his authority as health secretary, he can unilaterally decide that gender-affirming care — which  he calls “sex-rejecting procedures” — is not a safe and effective treatment for trans youth.
The response from states has been swift. Just before Christmas, 19 states — including Washington state, Colorado, and Minnesota — and Washington, D.C., sued Kennedy and the federal health agency over the announcement. The states’ lawsuit says the declaration harms their ability to administer state Medicaid plans in accordance with local laws protecting gender-affirming care.
“To me, the declaration is the extremely clear way they are trying to just shut down this care all across the country,” said Katie Keith, director of the center for health policy and the law at the O’Neill Institute at Georgetown Law. “They are trying to ban it nationwide for minors.”
On X, Stuart said that all three hospitals were referred to the agency’s inspector general’s office for failing to meet “recognized standards of health care,” citing Kennedy’s declaration.
The HHS has also proposed two new rules to restrict gender-affirming care for trans youth — both of which must still go through an approval process before they can be enforced. One rule would block hospitals from receiving Medicare and Medicaid funds if they provide gender-affirming care to trans youth. That care includes hormone replacement therapy for adolescents and puberty blockers for young kids who are experiencing dysphoria — intense discomfort or anxiety felt when someone’s physical gender is out of sync with their identity. It also includes surgery, which is very rarely performed on minors.
Another proposed rule would bar Medicaid from covering gender-affirming care for youth under 18 and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) from covering such care for youth under 19. This would disproportionately impact low-income trans youth. Technically, states could still use their own funds for coverage — but experts say that would be extremely burdensome and ultimately cause gaps in care.
The American Academy of Pediatrics, an organization of 67,000 primary care pediatricians and other specialists, strongly condemned these proposals, saying that they misrepresent current medical consensus and create uncertainty for patients.
“These rules are a baseless intrusion into the patient-physician relationship,” the group said in a statement. “Patients, their families, and their physicians — not politicians or government officials — should be the ones to make decisions together about what care is best for them.”The American Civil Liberties Union has said it will challenge these two restrictions in court if they are finalized.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/164A4473-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-07 17:59:13.473300

Andy Beshear announces plans for a housing development for flood victims, The Cottages at Thompson Branch in Marlowe. (Photo provided by governor's office)FRANKFORT — Democratic Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear is asking the GOP-controlled state legislature for $500 million in one-time spending to ease families’ “rising cost pressures,” fund his educational priority of “Pre-K for All” and pay for hundreds of millions in increased Medicaid costs. 
That’s according to a 12-page summary shared with reporters during a Wednesday morning budget briefing ahead of the governor’s State of the Commonwealth address later in the day. Beshear administration staff gave reporters the summary under embargo until the start of the 5:30 p.m. speech. 
Reporters did not receive the Beshear administration’s full budget proposal, usually constituting hundreds of pages detailing revenue and spending by individual government cabinets, agencies and programs.
The summary, however, does provide highlights of the governor’s policy priorities for the next two-year state budget, along with economic challenges the popular incumbent sees facing the state. High among those challenges is Congress’ passage of Republican President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, shifting costs for federal social safety net programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to states. 
Beshear’s earlier budget proposals have held little sway with the GOP-controlled General Assembly. Republican leaders often pass their own budget, disregarding much of what Beshear proposes, though occasional bipartisanship is found on specific issues. The legislature has easily overridden Beshear’s line-item vetoes of budget bills during past sessions. What’s adopted this year will be the last state budget before the two-term governor leaves office next year.
“With the modest revenue picture and hundreds of millions of dollars in expected pension obligations, increasing costs of health care, the need to invest in education, maintain public safety, and grow new jobs, the 2026-28 budget will be challenging,” the executive summary states. “Moreover Kentucky has to contend with federal actions that have pushed costs onto all states and have made it harder on families to afford health care or remain eligible for Medicaid. 
What is Beshear calling for? 
Some of Beshear’s proposals to address “affordability issues” echo past calls for action from advocates. 
Among the $500 million in Beshear’s proposed one-time spending:

$150 million for the Affordable Housing Trust Fund, a pool of money that the Kentucky Housing Corporation manages to subsidize housing projects. Affordable housing advocates across the state have made repeated calls for the Kentucky legislature to significantly bolster the fund.  
A $125 million fund for hospitals to bridge “financial risks” from federal One Big Beautiful Bill Act provisions that limit states’ use of provider taxes to support hospitals.
A $100 million fund to help cover the increase of health insurance costs from expiring tax credits for Affordable Care Act plans, called kynect in Kentucky.. 
Create a “Utility Assistance Fund” with $75 million to be distributed by community action agencies, to provide assistance for Kentuckians facing rising utility bills. Some advocates have called for a utility disconnection moratorium this winter.
$50 million to go to Feeding Kentucky, a network of seven food banks, to help with “rising food costs putting pressure on family budgets.” 

Beshear also calls for fully funding the state’s Medicaid program, requiring an additional $420 million from the General Fund for fiscal year 2028. The summary states the One Big Beautiful Act will remove an estimated 28,539 people from Medicaid due to tighter eligibility requirements added through the law. 
The budget proposal also calls for $101.5 million over two fiscal years to cover increased administrative costs shifted to states for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. 
Education funding continues to be a major component of Beshear’s budget proposal, calling for launching “Pre-K for All,” or universal preschool for 4-year-olds in Kentucky. His proposal would allocate $40.8 million, coming from the state’s sports wagering excise tax, for fiscal year 2028 to “support the initial phase of Pre-K for All.” 
Beshear’s is proposing an additional $158.8 million for schools — outside the Support Education Excellence in Kentucky, or SEEK, funding program — to give a 3% salary raise to full-time school personnel in fiscal year 2027. His proposal would allow teachers to retain a portion of their paycheck now going into a medical insurance trust fund. 
Along with fully funding teachers’ pensions and medical benefits for retirees, Beshear proposes a 2.5% increase in SEEK funding for school districts in each fiscal year of the biennium. 
State employees would also get a 2% salary raise each fiscal year while also fully funding pensions for government employees, according to the summary. 
Beshear wants to launch a $25 million Rural Economic Development Fund “to bring jobs to rural areas that have been close but have not had that big announcement yet.” He also wants to add another $70 million to develop sites for economic development projects. 
Beshear’s proposal calls for building two new female-only juvenile detention centers in Fayette County and Western Kentucky, an effort backed by a Republican state senator that failed to pass during the last budgetary session in 2024. 
The budget also details a proposed $42 million project to create a “reentry campus” in Morgan County where the Kentucky Community and Technical College System would provide vocational training to inmates in an effort to reduce recidivism.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/53012934592_479b702137_k-1024x577.jpg,,,2026-01-07 17:59:13.473300

Clerk ‘has committed several acts of misconduct or malfeasance,’ according to Gov. Mark Gordon. She doesn’t plan to resign.
The post Governor seeks Weston County clerk’s removal for 2024 election conduct, ignoring subpoena appeared first on WyoFile .","Gov. Mark Gordon has directed the Wyoming Attorney General’s office to seek the removal of Weston County Clerk Becky Hadlock, he announced Wednesday. 
“The Governor believes the Weston County Clerk has committed several acts of misconduct or malfeasance including her failure to appear for a legislative subpoena and her filing of a false audit report in conjunction with her duties as the Clerk of Weston County,” his office said in a statement. 
The issue dates back to the 2024 general election when Hadlock caused an initial ballot miscount in her county’s results after using the wrong ballots, resulting in a dramatic undercount in the vote for Speaker of the House Chip Neiman, who was running unopposed. Ultimately, a hand count sorted out the results, but the problem remained unresolved for many local voters who took issue with an initial post-election audit.
Additional issues arose: One pertained to allegations that Hadlock filed a false post-election audit. The second accused her of defying a legislative subpoena.
In October, Gordon received a verified complaint from four qualified electors of Weston County. That set off a process, as outlined in state law, that tasks the governor with determining whether to recommend the attorney general seek the removal of an elected official in district court. 
How we got here
This is the second time Gordon has been tasked with investigating Hadlock over her actions in the 2024 election. 
In the first investigation, Gordon decided that Hadlock “made many serious mistakes,” but “her actions do not rise to the level of misconduct or malfeasance, as I understand the meaning of those terms in this situation.” 
Since then, Hadlock failed to appear before a legislative body despite a subpoena to do so. The second complaint pointed to that decision, in addition to the post-election audit. 
After Hadlock was charged with a misdemeanor for defying the subpoena, her attorney asked the court to dismiss the case last month, contending that the subpoena is void because a legislative investigation was illegal to begin with. 
Ryan Semerad, Hadlock’s attorney, said in a Wednesday statement to WyoFile that his client “remains the elected county clerk for the people of Weston County.”
“She does not intend to resign. She looks forward to reviewing the Governor’s decision and findings as well as any legal filings to come regarding the Governor’s decision,” Semerad wrote. “In the meantime, she will continue to serve the people of Weston County to the very best of her ability.” 
Gordon’s decision
Hadlock’s first act of misconduct or malfeasance, according to Gordon’s findings letter, was “her failure to appear in response to the legislative subpoena.”
Rep. Chris Knapp of Gillette, co-chair of the Legislature’s Joint Management Audit Committee, sent a subpoena to Hadlock ahead of a September meeting of a subcommittee investigating her actions. But the clerk informed lawmakers via letter that she would not attend due to a scheduling conflict, and that others would appear on her behalf. 
“More pivotal in my determination here is her failure to confirm the adequacy of the arrangements and to take on faith, having heard nothing to the contrary, that those arrangements were satisfactory,” Gordon wrote. “It seems to me that any responsible public servant would make an effort to obtain some documentation or affirmation that their arrangements had been properly accepted before proceeding to miss such an obviously important summons from the legislature.”
Secondly, Gordon raised the issue of the post-election ballot, in which Hadlock “failed to discover twenty-one incorrect ballot entries,” he wrote, adding that that “could likely be construed as misconduct or malfeasance.”
The governor also wrote that based on the information he was provided, “there is no explanation from Clerk Hadlock or any other person as to how the audit could have indicated no problems when at least twenty-one ballots were not accounted for properly.”
As he found in his first investigation, Gordon wrote that he did “not believe that Clerk Hadlock displayed any malicious intent to the outcome of the election. However, her failure to properly perform the post-election audit adds to the governor’s previous findings of incompetence,” he wrote. 
“Taken together they contribute to the appearance of misconduct or malfeasance,” Gordon wrote. “These careless actions demonstrate at best an inattentiveness to detail and at worst a disregard for her responsibilities as County Clerk. Thus, it appears that Clerk’s Hadlock continued dereliction of duty on these pertinent matters aggregately amounts to misconduct or malfeasance.”
As such, Gordon directed Attorney General Keith Kautz to commence prosecution. 
In separate statements, the Wyoming Freedom Caucus and Secretary of State Chuck Gray lauded the decision to seek Hadlock’s removal. Both have been critical of how the governor has handled the matter in the past.

“The ownership of the Post-Gazette has been talking about how this day might come eventually, but it’s still shocking when the announcement actually goes out,” said Andrew Conte, the managing director of the center for media innovation at Point Park University. “It’s a blow to the media ecosystem, but also a blow to communities across southwestern Pennsylvania. We’ll have one fewer news organization telling the stories here, and the Post-Gazette was one of the major sources of information here.”

Conte said the Post-Gazette, founded in the 18th century as the Pittsburgh Gazette, is the oldest newspaper west of the Allegheny mountains.
“Going back to the pioneer days, this organization was the one telling stories of the lives of people who live here in southwestern Pennsylvania,” he said.
The paper had recently lost a legal battle with the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh, which represented Post-Gazette workers who’d been on strike between October 2022 and November 2025.
“Recent court decisions would require the Post-Gazette to operate under a 2014 labor contract that imposes on the Post-Gazette outdated and inflexible operational practices unsuited for today’s local journalism,” a press release said. “We deeply regret the impact this decision will have on Pittsburgh and the surrounding region.”
The press release said that Block Communications lost more than $350 million operating the paper over the last 20 years.
The announcement came the same day the U.S. Supreme Court denied a request from the paper to stay a lower court decision forcing them to reinstate the terms of a previous union contract.
“Rather than follow federal law, the Blocks, the owners of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, would rather destroy a very long-standing publication that serves the people of Pittsburgh,” said Jon Schleuss, president of the national NewsGuild-CWA. “They spent millions of dollars fighting journalists and refusing to follow federal labor law.”
Schleuss said the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh represents around 100 employees at the Post-Gazette.
Allan Block, who co-owns the paper with his brother John Robinson Block, hung up his phone after being reached by the Capital-Star.
Steve Mellon, a veteran reporter who’s spent more than 25 years at the Post-Gazette, said employees were called into an emergency meeting shortly after the Supreme Court announcement. Then, they learned in a pre-recorded video about Block Communications’ decision to close the paper.
“I thought, ‘You gotta be kidding me,’” Mellon said.”Especially thinking about my younger colleagues who are on their first or second jobs.”
The video, a recording of which was viewed by the Capital-Star, was roughly two-and-a-half minutes long. Employees were asked to work “under business as usual conditions” and “consider the legacy of the Post-Gazette” through the paper’s final day.
Union journalists at the Post-Gazette began an unfair labor practice strike in October, 2022 after working for years without a union contract.
The union alleged that the Blocks refused to negotiate in good faith and unilaterally changed reporters to a lower quality healthcare plan. 
They received several favorable decisions from the National Labor Review Board, an administrative law judge and the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals before returning to work in November, 2025 under the terms of their last collectively bargained contract. Before it ended, it was the longest ongoing strike in the country.
The paper, however, continued to publish during the strike. A number of journalists chose to remain on the job, and more employees were hired over the course of the three-year work stoppage.
Striking workers began an online publication of their own, the Pittsburgh Union Progress, which ceased operations when union journalists returned to the Post-Gazette.
“Post-Gazette journalists have done award-winning work for decades, and we’re going to pursue all options to make sure that Pittsburgh continues to have the caliber of journalism it deserves,” Andrew Goldstein, a Post-Gazette employee and president of the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh-CWA, said in a statement released Wednesday afternoon.
Schleuss said the Newsguild is willing to “pursue all options for the sake of the journalists and the Pittsburgh community.” That may include seeking potential buyers for the Post-Gazette or people interested in funding a new outlet.
“The Block Family should be ashamed of themselves,” said state Sen. Lindsey Williams (D-Allegheny), who supported striking workers by refusing interviews with the Post-Gazette during the three-year work stoppage. “They could have saved a ton of money if they just negotiated in good faith with the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh from the beginning. It is absurd that they repeatedly blame workers for their failure to manage their own business.
“My heart goes out to the Post-Gazette workers who have been through so much and have never deserved how they were treated. They are the only ones leaving that building with their dignity intact.”
The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette received Pulitzer Prizes, one of the highest honors in journalism, in 1938, 1998 and 2019. The most recent one was for  coverage of the deadly mass shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood.
Mellon, the veteran journalist, is still hopeful about the future for the Post-Gazettes employees and the Pittsburgh news ecosystem.
“Don’t count out the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh,” he said. “We’ve been up against gigantic odds in the past and we’ve come through. We know how to organize.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/PG-office-2-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-07 17:59:13.473300
,DC,2026-01-07 22:16:03+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Rubio to meet with Danish officials amid Greenland push by Trump administration,"Ariana Figueroa, Shauneen Miranda, Jennifer Shutt",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/rubio-meet-danish-officials-amid-greenland-push-trump-administration,,"WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Wednesday he will meet with Danish officials next week, following a recent push from the Trump administration to annex or even use the military against Greenland — a course of action questioned by several Republican senators.Senators sat through a closed, classified briefing Wednesday with Rubio about ongoing U.S. intervention in Venezuela launched over the weekend, and Democrats said afterward that he did not address their concerns about the operation. In addition, President Donald Trump is considering options to acquire Greenland, including possible military operations, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday.Danish officials have repeatedly stressed any move to take the sovereign nation by force would violate NATO bylaws, which bar members from acts of aggression against each other. Greenland, with a population of about 56,000, has its own local government but is also part of the Realm of Denmark.Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski told reporters she does not support Trump’s goals for Greenland. “I hate the rhetoric around either acquiring Greenland by purchase or by force. And you know I don't use the word hate very often. But I think that it is very, very unsettling,” Murkowski said. “And certainly concerning as one who has actually been to Greenland.”Rubio told reporters following the Venezuela briefing — open to all senators — that Energy Secretary Chris Wright will outline the Trump administration’s plans for that nation’s oil reserves later Wednesday. Trump said Saturday that the United States will “run the country” of Venezuela until “a proper transition can take place.”“We feel very positive that not only will that generate revenue that will be used for the benefit of the Venezuelan people ... but it also gives us an amount of leverage and influence and control over how this process plays out,” Rubio said. The Senate meeting with Rubio, which also included Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, followed days of escalation by the Trump administration abroad that included capturing Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and bringing him to the United States to face criminal charges, threatening to take Greenland by force from NATO member Denmark and seizing a Russian-flagged oil tanker in the North Atlantic sea as well as a second tanker tied to Venezuela.

Hegseth after the briefing defended the U.S. capture of the vessels, arguing the Trump administration was enforcing sanctions placed on Venezuelan oil. The episode with the oil tankers was disclosed early Wednesday when the U.S. military issued a social media statement that the Department of Defense and Department of Homeland Security apprehended a “stateless” ship in the Caribbean Sea and another in the North Atlantic. Leavitt said during an afternoon press briefing that Trump officials will meet with oil executives on Friday to discuss an ""immersive opportunity.”Hours after the Jan. 3 military operation to capture Maduro, Trump stressed that Venezuela’s oil reserves were a major factor in U.S. plans. Trump told reporters that major oil companies were notified before and after the operation in Venezuela. Senate GOP skepticalBesides Murkowski, a handful of other Senate Republicans also expressed concern about the White House statement leaving open the possibility of military action on Greenland.Oklahoma Republican Sen. James Lankford said “we need to not threaten a peaceful nation that's an ally where we have a military base already.” Maine GOP Sen. Susan Collins said she also disagreed with the Trump administration’s push to acquire Greenland and said she’s not sure if the Trump administration is serious about using military force.“It surprises me every time it comes up,” she said.GOP Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota said he doesn't “think military intervention is on the table” for Greenland. Louisiana’s Republican Sen. John Kennedy said “to invade Greenland would be weapons grade stupid, and I don't think President Trump is weapons grade stupid, nor is Marco Rubio.” He instead suggested possibly purchasing the territory, an offer that Denmark has already rejected.Kentucky Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell, chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, wrote in a critical statement that ""cooperation with Arctic allies from Canada to the Nordics already grants the United States sweeping access to positions of strategic importance.""  “Threats and intimidation by U.S. officials over American ownership of Greenland are as unseemly as they are counterproductive,"" McConnell wrote. ""And the use of force to seize the sovereign democratic territory of one of America’s most loyal and capable allies would be an especially catastrophic act of strategic self-harm to America and its global influence.""

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told reporters following his weekly press conference he couldn’t comment on hypotheticals about a military takeover of Greenland, including whether Congress must approve such an action. “No, I can’t because it depends on what that is. The Congress has a responsibility to declare war and I think there is no scenario where we’d be at war with Greenland,” Johnson said. “Under Article II, as we talked about in the room, the president has broad authority as commander-in-chief, as all previous presidents have. No one can forecast what is going to happen in Greenland. You’re asking a hypothetical that I cannot answer.”Johnson said during the press conference that he doesn’t believe anyone in the Trump administration is “seriously considering” military action in Greenland. “And in the Congress, we're certainly not.”Democrats move toward vote on war powersDemocratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut called the administration’s plan regarding Venezuelan oil “insane.” “They are talking about stealing the Venezuelan oil at gunpoint for a period of time undefined as leverage to micromanage the country,” he said. “The scope and insanity of that plan is absolutely stunning.” Though Murphy said he was glad administration officials held a briefing, he also said he envisioned a “very, very rough ride” ahead. Senate Democrats are gearing up to take another vote on a war powers resolution intended to curb Trump’s military actions abroad. An earlier attempt to pass a resolution was prompted by the administration’s multiple boat strikes in the Caribbean, which officials claimed were carrying drugs to the U.S., but backers failed to reach the 60-vote threshold in the Senate.The next vote, led by Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine, is expected to take place this week.Walking out of the briefing, Kaine said “it’s time to get this out of the (Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility) and get it in public hearings where senators can ask questions and the American public can learn what the hell is going on.” Such facilities are secure settings where classified information can be shared.Kaine said he could not get a clear answer from the briefing if the Trump administration’s actions in Venezuela will be replicated for other countries like Greenland or Cuba.Sen. Jacky Rosen questioned what the administration’s actions mean for the U.S., despite consensus Maduro is a “very brutal dictator” and satisfaction among many that he’s no longer governing Venezuela. While Maduro is no longer in charge, his vice president was sworn in, Delcy Rodríguez, effectively continuing the regime. “We have problems right here at home,” the Nevada Democrat said, pointing to the recent expiration of enhanced tax credits for people who purchase their health insurance on the Affordable Care Act marketplace. “Last time anybody checked, December 31st was just about a week ago, and how many people lost their health insurance because they couldn't afford it because Donald Trump's so busy, and Pete Hegseth’s so busy with the visuals of all these bombs going off all around the world that they're not paying attention to people who are going to lose their health care?” asked Rosen.Murphy, Kaine and Rosen all sit on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.Jacob Fischler contributed to this report.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2026-01-07 17:59:13.473300

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)For the past six years, anyone who places bets online in Rhode Island had just a single app available — one with some harsh reviews from users and lawmakers. But that could change later this year, the target date for the Rhode Island Lottery to select a second online sports betting vendor to join the state’s small digital sportsbook.
The Rhode Island Lottery intends to award a five-year contract to a company willing to “provide competitive sports wagering products and services” in the state’s market in November 2026,  according to a 55-page request for qualifications issued Dec. 2.
Potential bidders will have through noon on Feb. 19 to respond to the Lottery’s latest step in expanding Rhode Island’s small sportsbook market beyond the Sportsbook RI app run by International Game Technology (IGT).
“The intention is to seek one new app vendor (in addition to SportsbookRI) to begin offering online sports betting after November 2026,” Lottery spokesperson Paul Grimaldi said in an email to Rhode Island Current. “There would be an evaluation period, of unspecified length at the moment, to decide how well the new app is working, being accepted by bettors, and whether it’s adding to the state’s online sports betting revenue.”
Adding one more vendor still falls short of a recommendation in a Lottery-commissioned report published May 1 by Spectrum Gaming Group. The report called for the state to add four to six new online sports betting vendors to stay competitive with neighboring states. Massachusetts has seven vendors, while Connecticut allows three.
IGT, formerly headquartered in Providence before its 2024 acquisition by Las Vegas-based Apollo Global Management Inc., has managed the Sportsbook RI app since September 2019. The app has had mixed reviews from users even as it boasts a 4.4 star rating on Apple’s App Store and a 4.4 on Google Play. 
“Every time I win a PGA wager I have to call on Monday to try to collect my money,” one Google Play user wrote in August 2025. “It usually takes two days of calling for them to grade the wager.”
“They are lucky we only have one sportbook in RI or they would go out of business,” the same user added.
Another user wrote they would give the app zero stars if they could.
“I hate this app, customer service apologizes and says that they are expediting my case, but I never get a response from a supervisor, I don’t even think they have supervisors, because I’ve never spoken to one!” they wrote.
IGT will remain a part of the state’s market. The request for qualifications states IGT is contracted to provide equipment, technology, services and/or products related to both retail and online sports wagering through Nov. 25, 2028. The state’s most recent contract with the company signed in 2023, however, set a November 2026 expiration date but allowed three extensions: a three-year “first extension,” which was granted in 2023, followed by a two-year term, and a five-year.
Senate Majority Leader Frank Ciccone, a Providence Democrat who led the state’s push for additional sports betting vendors last year, said he was not aware of IGT’s extension.
“I was aware that it ends in 2026,” he told Rhode Island Current.
IGT confirmed the contract extension in a statement issued Wednesday afternoon following inquiry from Rhode Island Current.
“IGT is very pleased to continue our long-term relationship with the Rhode Island Lottery through 2028 and help generate important revenue for the State through its sports betting operations powered by PlaySports technology,” said Joe Bertolone, senior vice president of IGT Sports Betting, said in a statement. “IGT PlaySports continues to invest in the Sportsbook Rhode Island app to ensure the Lottery is offering a premier betting product that makes a positive impact on the State’s commitments to good causes.”
Lawmakers have tried to make sports betting more appealing in Rhode Island in recent years as a way to recapture bets that have since gone to neighboring states, including failed bills filed last year to expand the number of sports betting vendors to between three and five by July 2026.
An October 2025 report by the Rhode Island Office of the Auditor General found revenue generated by sports wagers declined by 3.2% in the most recent fiscal year that ended June 30, 2025 — with only $18.6 million transferred to the state’s general fund. In fiscal year 2024, the state received $19.2 million from sports betting.
Connecticut, which legalized sports betting in 2021, saw over $26 million in revenue from online bets in the most recent fiscal year, according to data from the state’s Department of Consumer Protection.
Massachusetts, which launched sports betting in 2023, saw over $157 million in online gaming revenue collected by the state in the most recent fiscal year, according to data from the commonwealth’s Gaming Commission.
Gaming companies had through Jan. 2 to email questions about the state’s solicitation to regulators by Jan. 2. Answers are expected to be emailed by Jan. 23 and posted on the state’s online bid portal afterward, according to the request for qualifications.
But just how much interest other companies have is being kept under wraps.
“RILOT has nothing to share at this time regarding submissions to the RFQ,” Grimaldi said.
R.I.’s sportsbook market may open up to competition next year. Here’s who’s waiting in the wings.

Eight firms responded to a preliminary call for interest issued over the summer, including IGT and Providence-based Bally’s Corp. Other respondents to that request included Fanatics, Kambi, DraftKings, BetMGM, OpenBet, and FanDuel. 
Rhode Island Current reached out to each company for comment on whether they plan to respond to the Lottery’s request for qualifications.
Patti Doyle, a spokesperson for Bally’s, said the company intends to submit a proposal to the state by its Feb. 19 deadline. As of 2026, the Providence-headquartered company runs online sports betting in 11 states, including Massachusetts.
Kambi spokesperson Peter Ranere told Rhode Island Current the Malta-based company “remains engaged in the process and continues to evaluate opportunities related to Rhode Island’s online sports betting market.”
The Rhode Island Lottery’s request asks that a potential vendor be able to get online wagering up and running by Nov. 30. No timeline has been set for a formal request for proposals.

Si bien pocas víctimas de los incendios del año pasado han regresado a sus hogares, eso no es inusual después de un desastre natural; cambios en el otorgamiento de permisos parecen estar ayudando. 


This article is also available in English. Read it here.
En los días posteriores al incendio de Los Ángeles en enero pasado, legisladores estatales y líderes cívicos prometieron impulsar la reconstrucción de las zonas afectadas. Para California, donde la tramitación de permisos y la construcción de viviendas son notoriamente lentas y costosas, la magnitud de la destrucción representó un desafío singular.
Un año después, las casas carbonizadas, los electrodomésticos derretidos y la ceniza tóxica han sido prácticamente retirados, la tierra subyacente raspada y luego retirada. Muchos de los residentes cuyas casas se salvaron han regresado. Se han solicitado permisos para la reconstrucción y se han contratado arquitectos y contratistas. Continúan las disputas con las compañías de seguros , los servicios públicos y los bancos; abundan los terrenos baldíos y los árboles ennegrecidos, pero si miras alrededor, aquí y allá encontrarás nuevas construcciones.
Hasta esta semana, se han emitido más de 2600 permisos residenciales entre Palisades y Altadena, aproximadamente uno por cada cinco de las casi 13,000 viviendas perdidas. Otros 3340 están en revisión.
Para muchos propietarios desplazados y traumatizados, esto representa un retorno insoportablemente lento a lo que era su vida antes del incendio. Pero, según los estándares históricos, la recuperación de Los Ángeles ha sido bastante rápida hasta ahora.
 En un comunicado de prensa conmemorativo del primer aniversario del desastre, el gobernador Gavin Newsom elogió las cifras de permisos como “históricas”.
 El año pasado, los gobiernos locales (la ciudad y el condado de Los Ángeles, así como Malibú y Pasadena) emitieron permisos para viviendas unifamiliares y unidades de vivienda auxiliares “tres veces más rápido” que en los cinco años previos al incendio, señaló la administración.
 Reconstruir después de un desastre es casi siempre un proceso lento y agotador. De las más de 22,500 viviendas destruidas en cinco de los incendios más destructivos de California entre 2017 y 2020, menos de cuatro de cada diez se habían reconstruido para 2025, según un análisis de Los Angeles Times de finales del verano pasado.
 Un año después de que grandes incendios arrasaron Maui, Paradise, Redding y las afueras de Boulder, Colorado, se había permitido la reconstrucción del 2%, 3%, 15% y 30% de las viviendas destruidas, respectivamente, según un análisis separado del Urban Institute.
 Según el ritmo de tramitación de permisos, la reconstrucción de Los Ángeles avanza con relativa rapidez. Pero los permisos recién obtenidos no son viviendas terminadas.
 “La gente puede obtener permisos, pero si no tienen los costos resueltos, hemos tenido gente que ha abandonado sus planes”, dijo Devang Shah, de Genesis Builders, empresa que vende reconstrucciones preaprobadas a precio fijo en Altadena. Usar los permisos como indicador de progreso podría ser prematuro, añadió.
 Parte del rápido progreso que ha experimentado Los Ángeles puede deberse a cambios regulatorios impuestos por decreto tras el incendio. A principios de 2025, tanto Newsom como la alcaldesa Karen Bass ordenaron una tramitación más rápida de permisos para reconstrucciones similares, es decir, construcciones que se ajustaran a las dimensiones aproximadas y las especificaciones de diseño de la vivienda anterior. El condado de Los Ángeles implementó un programa piloto de autocertificación de aprobación de planos de construcción para ciertos proyectos sencillos. Newsom eximió los requisitos del código de construcción para reducir el costo de la reconstrucción.
 “Obtuvimos la aprobación de planificación en tres días, algo que normalmente habría llevado tres meses”, dijo Tim Vordtriede, arquitecto que también perdió su casa en Altadena. El condado ha “realizado un trabajo extraordinario al optimizar al máximo la burocracia”.
 En las semanas posteriores al incendio, Vordtriede cofundó Altadena Collective, una red de diseñadores y arquitectos que ofrece servicios de diseño con descuento, asesoramiento sobre permisos y recomendaciones de contratistas a los sobrevivientes locales. Él y sus cofundadores Chris Driscoll y Chris Corbett también han creado una organización sin fines de lucro llamada Collective OR, cuyo objetivo es representar a propietarios inexpertos y ansiosos en las negociaciones con constructores y arquitectos.
 Es imposible decir: ‘Ya estaban aquí para esta fecha, así que nosotros también deberíamos estar allí’. El conjunto de datos es demasiado variable.Colette Curtis, directora de recuperación y desarrollo económico, Paradise
 El ritmo de la reconstrucción puede simplemente beneficiarse del hecho de que se lleva a cabo en el condado de Los Ángeles: un gigantesco centro económico repleto de recursos financieros y conexiones políticas.
 “Tenemos acceso a una cadena de suministro realmente buena, hay mucho capital, hay mucha infraestructura”, dijo Ben Stapleton, director del US Green Building Council California.
 Esto contrasta con una ciudad como Paradise.
Desde que la mayoría de las viviendas de la localidad fueron destruidas en un incendio en 2018, se han reconstruido menos de 1 de cada 5, dijo Colette Curtis, directora de recuperación y desarrollo económico de la ciudad del condado de Butte.
Curtis advirtió que no se debe comparar el ritmo de los esfuerzos de reconstrucción entre las comunidades afectadas por el desastre.
 “Es imposible decir: ‘Ya estaban aquí para esta fecha, así que nosotros también deberíamos estar allí'”, dijo. “El conjunto de datos es demasiado variable”.
Paradise, un pueblo remoto con ingresos relativamente bajos, carecía de los servicios locales y del atractivo filantrópico de lugares como Lahaina y Palisades, dijo. Pero la baja en el valor de los terrenos y el hecho de que los propietarios desplazados no hayan tenido que competir con los inversores que reservan nuevas unidades para alquileres turísticos fue un factor positivo.
 Otra cosa que puede darle una ventaja a Los Ángeles es que es una región que también tiene un gran nivel de experiencia.
 Casi al mismo tiempo que Vordtriede estaba creando el Altadena Collective, la pareja de arquitectos vecinos Cynthia Sigler y Alex Athenson lanzaron el Catálogo Foothill, un paquete de planos arquitectónicos y estructurales listos para usar que han sido aprobados previamente por el condado de Los Ángeles.
 Con aproximadamente 15 proyectos en construcción o preparándose para comenzar, Athenson dijo que el proceso de preaprobación puede reducir al menos un 10% el costo total de desarrollo de una casa unifamiliar personalizada.
 Esto se debe en parte a la simplificación del proceso de aprobación. Pero también a que, antes del incendio, una vivienda unifamiliar a medida en Altadena era un producto de lujo.
La industria local está “preparada para atender a ese cliente que construye la casa de sus sueños desde cero, con un presupuesto muy amplio, si no ilimitado”, dijo Athenson. Los propietarios de larga data desplazados por incendios, muchos de ellos con ingresos fijos, representan un tipo de cliente muy diferente.
 Mientras los constructores, diseñadores y formuladores de políticas se esfuerzan por reconstruir de formas más rápidas, más económicas y más resistentes al fuego, pueden tropezar con una solución que podría ser útil mucho después de que se reconstruya la última casa en Altadena, agregó.
 “En definitiva, estamos ofreciendo un sistema para un desarrollo de vivienda más eficiente y asequible”, dijo Athenson. “Me entusiasma probarlo en Altadena y ver qué sucederá más allá”.
 Hasta la fecha, el condado ha aprobado más de dos docenas de planos del catálogo. Athenson afirmó que están negociando con la ciudad de Los Ángeles la implementación de un lote similar para Palisades.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/083025-Palisades-Fire-Rebuild-GETTY-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-07 17:12:47.229597

(Photo by Lauren Sausser/KFF Health News)COLUMBIA — South Carolina’s measles outbreak is among the worst in the country as the number of cases in the Upstate continues to rise with no end in sight, health officials said Wednesday.
As of Tuesday, 211 people in the state were diagnosed with the highly contagious virus, according to the state health department. That’s more than any state but Texas, which reported more than 800 cases in 2025, according to the Texas health agency.
Four of the cases in South Carolina required hospital stays, said state epidemiologist Linda Bell. She did not disclose any more information on those people or their conditions, citing patient privacy concerns.
SC measles cases grow to 144, with more expected following holiday travel

South Carolina’s outbreak has begun to spread in neighboring states as well, with four North Carolina children who visited Spartanburg County testing positive for the disease, according to the neighboring health department.
“It is clear the virus is circulating in the community,” Bell told reporters Wednesday. “The question is who in the community, who is susceptible, will get infected.”
The only surefire way to stop the virus from spreading is vaccination, Bell said. Of the people infected during the ongoing outbreak, at least 93% were unvaccinated, according to the health department.
“The more people we get vaccinated, the faster we can slow the spread of the virus,” Bell said.
As of Wednesday, 144 people were in quarantine for exposure to the virus without previous immunity, such as vaccination or a previous infection.
That included nine students from two Spartanburg schools: Sugar Ridge Elementary and Boiling Springs Elementary.
Other cases came from exposures at Tabernacle of Salvation Church, Slavic Pentecostal Church of Spartanburg and Ark of Salvation Church. All three churches in Inman conduct services in the Russian language. Exposures also occurred at Unitarian Universalist Church in Spartanburg, according to the health department.
The health department has been working with leaders in the church and community to encourage people to get vaccinated while remaining respectful of cultural barriers, said Bell, who added they’re working with interpreters.
Officials aren’t expecting the rise in cases to stop anytime soon, Bell said. At least some of the people in quarantine, as well as their household members, are likely to develop symptoms of the highly contagious disease, she said.
Measles symptoms, which include a fever and rash, generally start between one and three weeks after infection.
Although the health department encourages people exposed to the virus to stay home and limit interactions with others, some who are unaware of their exposure may continue going in public, potentially passing the disease along, Bell said. Enclosed spaces with a lot of people interacting, such as churches and schools, can become hotbeds for the virus.
Until enough people are vaccinated to stop the virus’ spread, “this could go on for many, many more weeks,” Bell said.
The U.S. could lose its measles-free status this month, a designation meaning the virus is not freely circulating the country year-round. The country was first declared measles-free in 2000, 32 years after the vaccine became available.
Most people receive two doses of the measles vaccine, which also covers mumps and rubella, during childhood. Unvaccinated adults can still get both doses, which protects from the disease in about 97% of cases.
Getting a shot within 72 hours of exposure to the virus can help prevent illness, and anyone who does so can skip the 21-day quarantine, Bell said. Few people have taken that option, she added, without providing numbers.
South Carolina is also a hotspot for flu cases, according to the CDC.
As of Saturday, the most recent data available, 15,589 people tested positive for influenza since the flu season began in September, according to the Department of Public Health.
That’s more than double the number of cases reported last year, though it still falls far below the 45,000 influenza cases reported during the 2023-2024 season, according to the health agency’s data.
This season, 26 people have died from the flu. All but one were at least 50 years old. One was a child from the Upstate, though the health department did not release any more information about the child’s age or location.
“To prevent complications and deaths, it’s critical that everyone in South Carolina get their flu shots as well as updated vaccines for respiratory illnesses, including COVID and respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV,” Bell said in a statement.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MobileHealthUnit-measles-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-07 17:12:47.229597

Missing from the first day were the partisan fireworks that defined the end of last year’s session and a special session in September. Instead, both the House and Senate functioned normally on Wednesday, quickly running through motions of a first-day and adjourning with little fanfare. 
But the partisan schism simmered under the surface. 
Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe is pushing for elimination of the state’s income tax and is expecting to lay out his plan next week when he speaks to a joint session of the legislature for his annual State of the State address. 
Democrats — still smarting from last year’s GOP moves to cut off debate to pass bills repealing expanded paid sick leave, gerrymander the state congressional map, change the initiative petition process and reimpose an abortion ban — said they are withholding judgment until they see the details of Kehoe’s plan. 
But they note the income tax represents 65% of last year’s $13.4 billion in state revenue. 
Missouri faces budget crunch as capital gains tax cut hits harder than expected 

Democrats will not support raising taxes that disproportionately impact lower-income Missourians to pay to eliminate the income tax, said Senate Minority Leader Doug Beck, an Affton Democrat.
“People are already having a really hard time making ends meet in this state,” Beck said. “People are living paycheck to paycheck. So if anyone wants to raise taxes on those folks, that is unacceptable to us. As Democrats, we say there should be no new taxes.”
House Minority Leader Ashley Aune, a Kansas City Democrat, said that while the possible elimination of the income tax is “being sold as…getting rid of your taxes,” most Missourians will see little benefit.
“What they’re not telling you is how much more you’ll have to spend every time you swipe your card,” Aune said, adding: “The next time you have an expensive car repair or costly emergency visit from a plumber to fix a broken pipe, you’ll also be paying double digit sales taxes on that bill. Struggling to pay your rent? The struggle will get even harder when Republicans add a sales tax onto that.”
Democrats will lay out their own income tax proposal next week, Aune said, that will offer “targeted tax relief for those who need it most.”
State Rep. Mark Boyko, the Kirkwood Democrat who will sponsor the measure, said that while Missourians earning over $250,000 could end up paying more under the Democrats’ tax plan, it would generate much-needed revenue. 
The proposal, Boyko said, “will actually lower your costs.”
Senate President Cindy O’Laughlin, a Shelbina Republican, urged her colleagues in an opening day speech to work together to “find solutions that move Missouri forward.”
While tax cuts weren’t directly mentioned in her speech, O’Laughlin left little doubt where she stood.
“Taxes, regulations, red tape and bureaucracy do not make Missouri better,” she said. “In every case, they take from Missouri families, they also take from Missouri small businesses. And our job is to reduce that impact. We must make sure what we take is as limited as possible.”
Missouri families want results, O’Laughlin said. 
“They want better roads, better schools,” she said. “They want more private home ownership. They want safe streets and neighborhoods. They want better jobs and stronger job skills. They want thriving communities, and they want less dependence on the government at all levels.”
Hovering over the income tax debate is a state budget picture looking gloomier than it has in years. 
General revenue is projected to be $400 million below estimates made a year ago. Part of the reason is that a capital gains tax cut passed last year that was estimated to reduce revenue by $111 million annually is now believed to cost as much as $500 million the first year and $360 million a year moving forward. 
Beck said that while Democrats decided against using procedural maneuvers to gum up the Senate on the first day, the chamber will move much more slowly this year — not only in response to last year’s GOP moves quash Democratic filibusters, but also to avoid mistakes like the cost of the capital gains tax cut. 
“When you shut off debate or refuse to engage with the other side to just rush things through, mistakes happen,” he said. “We were screaming from the hilltop that the capital gains cuts were going to cost way more. But we went too fast, and senators weren’t allowed to do their jobs.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-512285042-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-07 17:12:47.229597

(Courtesy of Mayday Health)A dispute over abortion-rights advertising in South Dakota has spawned dueling state and federal lawsuits.
A New York-based nonprofit filed a federal lawsuit Tuesday against South Dakota Attorney General Marty Jackley. The lawsuit seeks to prevent Jackley from taking legal action against the nonprofit’s abortion-rights campaign at gas stations across the state.
Jackley asked a South Dakota judge last month to stop the campaign, which includes gas-pump placards asking “Pregnant? Don’t want to be?” and provides a link to Mayday Health’s website. The nonprofit educates people about the safety and effectiveness of abortion pills. It began its ad campaign in early December, and Jackley sent the group a cease-and-desist letter days later.
State seeks court order to stop abortion-pill ad campaign

In the new federal suit, filed in the Southern District of New York, Mayday claims Jackley’s actions are unconstitutional because the nonprofit’s website and advertising materials are protected.
“We’re not taking the signs down,” said Mayday’s Executive Director Liv Raisner in a December Instagram post. “It’s First Amendment-protected free speech, and information is not illegal.”
Mayday’s lawsuit says Jackley “may not punish Mayday for publishing truthful information on a public issue” such as “ information about legal abortion services in jurisdictions that have made abortion illegal.”
In his cease-and-desist letter, Jackley said abortion pills are illegal in the state, and that Mayday Health publishes incorrect and dangerous information.
“These ads are targeting women — including teenagers — encouraging them to take these pills while misleading them about the potential physical risks,” Jackley said in a December news release. “At the same time, they promote secrecy by urging women not to inform their doctors and children not to tell their parents.”
South Dakota lawmakers adopted an abortion trigger ban in 2005 that took effect in 2022, after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Abortions are prohibited in the state, unless the mother’s life is threatened by a pregnancy. State lawmakers also passed legislation in 2022 banning “medical abortion by telemedicine.”
In 2023, medication abortions accounted for 63% of abortions in the country, according to data from the Guttmacher Institute. The drugs mifepristone and misoprostol, commonly used in medication abortions, are also listed on the World Health Organizations’ list of essential medicines. In 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected an attempt by anti-abortion medical organizations to overturn the Food and Drug Administration’s prescribing guidelines for mifepristone.
Jackley has not yet filed a response to Mayday’s federal lawsuit.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-07 21:58:17+00:00,CT Mirror,Erin Stewart qualifies early for public campaign financing,Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/07/erin-stewart-qualifies-early-for-public-campaign-financing/,The GOP's Erin Stewart qualified for public financing from the Citizens’ Election Program earlier than any previous candidate for CT governor.,"The gubernatorial campaign of Republican Erin Stewart cleared a significant hurdle Wednesday by qualifying for public financing from the voluntary Citizens’ Election Program earlier than any previous candidate for governor.
The State Elections Enforcement Commission unanimously approved Stewart’s application, immediately providing her an $806,875 convention grant and the promise of at least another $15.4 million if she wins the GOP nomination.
To qualify, Stewart had to raise at least $250,000 in small-dollar donations that could range from $5 to $340 each, a task others have struggled to accomplish before June, leaving little time to staff up for an August primary.
“It’s a statement of credibility and broad public support,” said John Healey, the Stewart campaign’s general consultant and senior advisor.
Stewart is the beneficiary of revisions made after 2022, the last of two election cycles dominated by wealthy self-funders who could not only spend far more than publicly financed rivals but could start sooner. 
The grants were about $1.3 million for a primary and $6.5 million for a general election, and the earliest grant could not be paid until a candidate qualified for a primary at a nominating convention in May. 
As a result, Republican Bob Stefanowski, a self-funder new to politics, began spending in January on his campaign for governor in 2018, five months before two publicly financed rivals, Mark Boughton and Tim Herbst, got their grants.
Under the revisions, the grants more than doubled to about $3.2 million for a primary and $15.4 million for a general election. And for the first time, an $806,875 advance on the primary grant would be available immediately upon qualifying, as Stewart did Wednesday.
Her campaign immediately announced staffing hires.
“We’ve been running for the past year on ‘loyalty and love,’ as the mayor says,” Healey said. “This gives the campaign the ability to staff up and run a full-fledged field operation.”
Stewart, 38, the former mayor of New Britain, is competing for the nomination with state Sen. Ryan Fazio, 35, of Greenwich, who also plans to seek public financing. Betsy McCaughey, 77, a Newsmax host and former lieutenant governor of New York, has told Republicans she is likely to run.
Jim Conroy, a spokesman for the Fazio campaign, said the quarterly finance report due on Jan. 10 will show him also surpassing the $250,000 threshold — and doing so “faster than any other statewide campaign.”
Fazio began fundraising after opening his campaign in August. Stewart didn’t declare her candidacy until November, but she began raising qualifying contributions for public financing in January 2025 through an exploratory committee.
Stewart, who was mayor for 12 years, did not seek reelection in November, hewing to a plan and timetable drawn a year ago: raise money through an exploratory committee, declare her candidacy immediately after the municipal elections in November, and apply for public financing in December.
“She posted a very strong fundraising record throughout the course of the year,” Healey said. “She has ticked every box, despite the naysayers saying, ‘She’ll hit a wall at some point.’”
Stewart filed her application in late December. The approval Wednesday came after an audit ensuring that the qualifying contributions met the requirements of the law. Ultimately, she raised $287,153 in qualifying contributions.
Connecticut’s public financing system, a reform created in response to the bid-rigging scandal that forced Gov. John G. Rowland from office in 2004, is nearly universally used by state legislative candidates. 
Participants must abide by spending limits. One of the other reforms was a ban on contributions by state contractors to any candidate for state office, whether they sought public financing or not.
Gov. Dannel P. Malloy won the open seat for governor in 2010 as a publicly financed candidate, defeating self-funders in a Democratic primary and then in the general election. He was reelected in 2014, again with public financing.
The program has since become irrelevant in gubernatorial elections.
Democrat Ned Lamont and Stefanowski opted out of the voluntary program in 2018 and in their 2022 rematch. Lamont spent $25.7 million to win reelection to a second term; Stefanowski spent $14.5 million that year.
Lamont spent $8 million on television ads in the last five weeks of the campaign, more than the total spending Citizens’ Election Program would have allowed over the entirety of the campaign.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_6620-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-07 16:59:12.678536

(Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — In plain view of the public, progressive State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha tore down part of a Nebraska Capitol display distributed by the conservative nonprofit PragerU and the White House on the first day of the legislative session. 
Gov. Jim Pillen had said the purpose of hosting the display, sponsored by the state’s Semiquincentennial Commission, was to let the state “celebrate the country’s 250th anniversary.” The nonprofit behind the images has faced criticism for sharing content that historians consider misleading and inaccurate. The latest display is part of a push from the Trump administration’s White House Task Force 250, outreach designed to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the U.S.
Cavanaugh told the Examiner she removed the frames because “we are not allowed to adhere anything to walls in the hallway of the Capitol.”  She said generally any such display would be placed near the information desk and not in the Capitol’s hallways. 
“I have always been a stickler for the rules … so I removed the prohibited objects,” Cavanaugh said.

A Cavanaugh office aide said the removed portraits were “gone” when asked by the Examiner Wednesday morning, but they were in her office. Cavanaugh, a Democrat in the officially nonpartisan Legislature, said someone would pick up the paintings from her office. 
Speaker John Arch of La Vista confirmed that Cavanaugh told him that she had removed the portraits. Arch said the commission can display in the Capitol with approval, which he said the group had received from the Nebraska Capitol Commission.

State Sen. Brad von Gillern of the Elkhorn area shared photos of Cavanaugh pulling down the paintings. The posters were back up after 3 p.m. 
Pillen, in a social media post, shared Capitol security footage of the incident from the Nebraska State Patrol. In them, Cavanaugh can be seen removing the paintings.
“Celebrating America during our 250th year should be a moment of unity and patriotism, not divisiveness and destructive partisanship,” said Pillen, a Republican. “I am disappointed in this shameful and selfish bad example.”

President Donald Trump marked the new year by launching a military assault on Venezuela and abducting President Nicolás Maduro. Some 75 people in Venezuela were killed in the Saturday attack and 7 U.S. service members were injured, according to the Washington Post. Many Democrats and some Republicans have denounced the act as unconstitutional, while Trump has followed up by threatening more military action against Cuba, Mexico, Columbia and Greenland. 
This week also marks the fifth anniversary of the January 6th insurrection on the U.S. Capitol by a mob of Trump supporters who were attempting to overturn Trump’s loss in the 2020 presidential election. 
I spoke with Vermont Sen. Peter Welch about these escalating domestic and international crises under the Trump administration just before he returned to Washington. 
The following transcript has been edited for length and clarity.

David Goodman  
Let’s begin by getting your thoughts on the US actions against Venezuela this weekend.
Peter Welch  
It’s reckless and it’s wrong. I mean, let’s acknowledge the military did a very professional job, but the decision the President made to depose the leader of another country, authoritarian that he was, and then to say that this is about us running Venezuela, and then to say that he wants our big oil companies like Exxon to take over Venezuelan oil brings us back to gunboat diplomacy. It’s very, very dangerous. I’m adamantly opposed to what the President did.
David Goodman  
What did you as a United States senator know about this operation in advance?
Peter Welch  
Absolutely nothing. I’m a United States senator and the United States Senate is the institution that has the authority to authorize a military action. This was an act of war. We were never consulted. We were never involved. So we knew no more than any other citizen who woke up that morning. And what you’re seeing is that the President is completely acting beyond the authority of an executive. In my view, Congress has to stand up and resist that. But we don’t have Republican support, and we need that. I am a co sponsor of a resolution condemning this and I’m going to be urging my Republican colleagues that we not relinquish our authority and have a president who is exceeding the powers that the Constitution gives him.
David Goodman  
How is this supposed to work? For example, what happened when President George W. Bush invaded Iraq in 2003?
Peter Welch  
The President comes to Congress and asks for an authorization to use force, and in the case of President Bush, he did that before he went to Iraq. I was opposed to that and many members of Congress were, but a majority supported him. But the President did come to Congress. There’s a reason for that. When we’re going to put our men and women in harm’s way, that’s a major decision. Deciding to use military force is an easy decision for a president like Trump, but the consequences of it are paid for by our country and by men and women who are willing to serve at the call of the Commander in Chief. That decision should be deliberated. There should be a discussion, there should be a debate. There should be accountability by members of Congress that they said yes or they said no to this request by the President. What there shouldn’t ever be is the arbitrary capacity of an individual who happens to be president to plunge us into a war.
David Goodman  
President Trump said in his address to nation on Saturday that this is all going to be free. It’s going to be paid for by Venezuela. Do you believe that?
Peter Welch  
No, absolutely. He said that about the (border) wall too. Let’s just discuss this. There is a decision that only the President made. Number one, the decision was to take out Maduro. Number two, everybody in Maduro’s government is still in power. Number three, the President says we’re going to run the country. How are we going to do that? Number four, he says our oil companies like Exxon are going to take over the Venezuelan oil fields. None of those things can happen and none of them should happen. So the President is saying, “they’re going to pay for it.” This same president won’t lift a finger to extend the health care tax credits that have already expired and where we’re going to have about 25,000 Vermonters without health care as a result of that. No, this is bogus.
David Goodman  
Right now there are Vermonters in the Caribbean, the Vermont Air National Guard. What do we know about the role that they are playing in this operation?
Peter Welch  
First of all, we are all so impressed and appreciative of our Guard. They got 11 days notice right around the Christmas holidays and had to pick up and leave their families behind. There was no notice for them. What we do know is that none of them have been injured, and I am so pleased that that is the news that we have, and we are awaiting a report about what role they did play. But of course, we have the Air National Guard and they have air assets, and obviously those were a big part of this operation, so we’ll find out. But I don’t know exactly what they were requested to do.
David Goodman  
The President has described the strategic principle here as the “Donroe Doctrine,” his update of the 200 year old Monroe Doctrine. What do you understand Trump’s doctrine to be?
Peter Welch  
The Monroe Doctrine was an assertion by President James Monroe that European powers could not colonize countries in this hemisphere. What the “Donroe” Doctrine is is the United States can impose its will on countries in this hemisphere. Totally different. It’s more about gunboat diplomacy. It’s more about imperialism. These are the President’s words: “we’re going to run the country in Venezuela,” “we’re going to have our oil companies there.” That has absolutely nothing to do with the Monroe Doctrine. If the President is, in a kind of pathetic way, trying to make a new word of “Donroe,” the Don is more like a mob boss than it is a diplomat or a statesman.
David Goodman  
The United States does not have state-run oil companies, but President Trump is saying that private American oil companies are going to rebuild the infrastructure of Venezuela’s oil industry. Does that make sense to you?
Peter Welch  
No, absolutely not. I first started getting interested in Latin America during the President Kennedy administration. There had been a history of the United States companies essentially toppling governments to their own advantage. United Fruit in Nicaragua, of course, the United States toppling an elected government in Guatemala in 1954. What President Kennedy did was really started moving us to where we were promoting democracy. The Alliance for Progress, the Peace Corps — they became the United States engagement in Latin America and South America, which were more premised on the ideals of democratic participation and democratic rule. President Trump has repudiated that totally and completely. What he wants to do is have transactional engagements with these countries that benefit him or benefit American companies. The aspiration for democratic rule or facilitating the path to democracy is totally rejected by this President. It is completely the wrong way to go.
David Goodman  
In the first year of President Trump’s second term, the United States has taken military action against seven different countries, including three that we’ve never waged war against. After attacking Venezuela, Trump threatened action against Cuba, Mexico and Greenland. What can or will constrain him?
Peter Welch  
It has to be Congress and the American people. But right now, the biggest dilemma we have in Congress is that my Republican colleagues have abdicated the constitutional authority that we have as members of Congress in so many areas that the President is acting more like a king. Under Article One of the Constitution, Congress has to vote on war making and authorize it in Appropriations. It’s up to Congress, the power of the purse. The President is disregarding that. In area after area, my Republican colleagues have been willing to abdicate their authority and their responsibility and delegate it to the President. So you’re having this undemocratic concentration of power in a president who knows no limits and thinks that because he is president, he can do whatever he wants. That’s a real threat to our democratic governing system.
David Goodman  
This seems to have opened up some cracks in the MAGA coalition. We are hearing about opposition from Marjorie Taylor Greene and Representative Thomas Massie, also Senator Rand Paul, who have opposed this break with the idea of “America First.” Do you think this could cause other fractures within that coalition?
Peter Welch  
I do. Americans do not want us getting involved in foreign wars. They support our military, and we need our strong military to make certain that we’re defended. But this action in Venezuela is not to protect us from a threat to our country from Venezuela. His talk about taking over Greenland is not to protect us from a threat by Greenland or Denmark, and likewise, Colombia. Most Americans know that asking our citizen soldiers to go to war for presidential preferences is absolutely wrong. We’ve got to take care of things that are really tough for everyday working people in our country. Right now, Vermonters are losing health care. The President hasn’t lifted a single finger to extend those tax credits so that Vermonters and Americans won’t lose health care. The president ran as a person who was against these “forever wars” and now he’s embracing these wars, not just in Venezuela, but also the threats In Colombia, the threats in Greenland and in Cuba. Why?
David Goodman  
Why do you think he has pivoted in such a dramatic fashion from a core principle that he has run on?
Peter Welch  
The biggest support group he has is the billionaires. If Venezuelan oil is now suddenly run by American oil companies, they benefit. And I’m not even certain the oil companies want what he’s doing. The President is very, very good as a politician in stoking division, but his real loyalty where his policies have consistently been applied is when it comes to enhancing the wealth of the very wealthy. The tax cut bill, the One Big Beautiful Bill went largely to billionaires. When he talks about foreign policy, he talks about getting American companies in Venezuela in on the oil. When he meets with leaders from Middle Eastern countries, they talk about crypto deals or meme coin deals that involve his family. That’s an obvious motivator for the President. It’s really tough for Vermonters now with health care, with the cost of housing, and our small businesses that are contending with these tariffs that are really punishing their ability to sell their products and compete. They don’t have the telephone number of the Secretary of Treasury where they can call up and get an exemption like a lot of Trump friends can. Our job is to get us focused back on the well being of American citizens, of having a fair and square economy where people work hard, and if they do and they have a good product, they can get ahead and their success doesn’t depend on whether they’re connected to the President or whether they made a big fat campaign contribution.
David Goodman  
This week marks the fifth anniversary of the January 6 insurrection in which Trump supporters attacked the US Capitol. You were in the Capitol that day. How did that experience change you, and in your view, change the country?
Peter Welch  
I was shocked, as we all were. I was in the gallery in the House of Representatives about 30 feet from where the shot was fired. I was on the floor above, but it was right below me. I couldn’t believe it. And I was there when the mob was breaking the doors down. They were ultimately unsuccessful, but they broke the glass. I was seeing our security people with guns drawn. And what to this day still stuns me is that even though I was there, even though in real time I was hearing the shot, I was seeing the glass being broken, I didn’t believe it was happening. It couldn’t happen because this is the United States of America, and we’ve never had an insurrection to stop the peaceful transfer of power. We’ve been so blessed with this tradition where the winner is certified as the winner, and where violence is not used to change the outcome of an election. That changed that day. And what was also painful was to see these Capitol Police officers who I see every day, and they’re just wonderful people that work hard, and they then became vilified, as though they were the attackers and the people who attacked them, who kicked them, who spat on them, who bit them, who tried to rip their helmets off and nearly break their necks — those people were pardoned for attacking a police officer. That continues to be shocking to me. And you’ve got President Trump trying to rewrite history. We can’t on this fifth anniversary allow that to happen. And I’ll be with many of my colleagues who will be on the Senate floor describing what happened that day, what we experienced, and what the true history is of that event.
David Goodman  
That’s such a powerful image of you not believing your own eyes. For decades, you have believed in one kind of American story, and even though it was unraveling in front of you, you couldn’t believe it. Do you feel like you still respond that way to some of what you’re seeing?
Peter Welch  
It’s changing. Our democracy is under threat with what Trump is doing. There’s no question. But here’s what is now animating me. I think about those police officers who reported for duty, and then even through what they’ve been through, they keep coming back. I still look at the Capitol when I walk to work, and I just think about the incredible commitment this country has had in its constitution, in its declaration of independence to the aspiration of equality of all men and women, and how so much of our history has been about the effort to achieve that, to make it more real, to make it more encompassing for more people. That’s a worthy goal and it is under assault now. But I think about folks who came before me like John Lewis, and Martin Luther King, and how they devoted their lives to the perfection of our democracy. It’ll never be perfect. But isn’t it a worthy aspiration, even if it’s under assault?
David Goodman  
Do you think something like January 6 could happen again?
Peter Welch  
It could happen again. This a jump-ball situation. What’s going to be the outcome is not inevitable, and that’s why it takes all of us to do whatever it is we can. We’re in a very dangerous place in our democracy and what the outcome is going to be, I can’t predict. But I can tell you this, we in Vermont are going to do every single thing we can. What Vermont does is (have) fierce debate about how to solve this or that problem, but also a shared sense that we’re all in it together and that we have a shared obligation to the future of our state. We need more of that in Washington.

Doug Mastriano (R-Franklin) and his wife, Rebbie, announced Wednesday that the politician wouldn't seek the governor's seat this year. (Photo by Whitney Downard/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)State Sen. Doug Mastriano said Wednesday he won’t make another bid for governor in a livestreamed event with his wife, Rebbie.
“We remain in this fight with you and for you. We’ve prayed a lot, we’ve fasted, we’ve discussed it a lot. Many of you reached out to us, beseeching us and urging us to run,” said Mastriano during a Facebook livestream. 
“But we believe, with full peace in our hearts, that God has not called us to run for governor this year.”
The Franklin County Republican ran against now-Gov. Josh Shapiro in 2022 and was resoundingly defeated. He didn’t endorse state Treasurer Stacy Garrity, saying “we’ll talk about that down the road.” She won the party’s nomination in September. SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
But having a Republican governor would mean that “the grassroots is going to have to back the candidate,” Mastriano said, without naming Garrity.
The Mastrianos spent most of the announcement reminiscing, relitigating the COVID-19 pandemic and recounting tales from the 2022 campaign trail without explicitly saying whether or not he’d run again. Opponents of his 2022 campaign repeatedly highlighted Mastriano’s role in supporting President Donald Trump’s attempt to overturn the 2020 election, including his presence outside the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, when rioters stormed the building and drove Congress from its chambers to disrupt the vote certification. 
More than 500 people watched the hourlong video, which included 2022 campaign ads and roughly 25 minutes with the Mastrianos.
Doug Mastriano said he was still a state senator and is not up for reelection in 2026. His current term ends in 2028. 
Shapiro is expected to announce his reelection campaign on Thursday. Aside from Garrity, no other Republican has announced their intention to run for governor — nor has anyone yet indicated a plan to run for the party’s lieutenant governor nomination.

Senate wants teacher raise, opposes vouchers",Devna Bose,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/07/misissippi-school-choice-battle-house-senate-teacher-raise/,"Mississippi House Speaker Jason White, R-West, surveys the House floor on the first day of the 2026 regular session, Tuesday, Jan. 6, 2026, at the Mississippi Capitol in Jackson, Miss.","As the Senate passed a teacher raise and several other plans on Wednesday, the House unveiled its long-awaited omnibus education package aimed at greatly expanding school choice in Mississippi and reshaping the state’s education system.  
The fight over school choice, policies that often give families public dollars to pay for private schools or other alternatives to public education, has been brewing in Mississippi for years and reached a fever pitch in recent months.
The two chambers of the Legislature drew lines in the sand Wednesday, setting up a battle in the weeks or months ahead. While the Senate wants a tweak to allow more public-to-public school district transfers, the House is pushing for wide-ranging changes, including letting parents spend public money on private schools.
Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann and Education Chairman Dennis DeBar said vouchers or other means of spending tax dollars on private schools won’t fly in the Senate.
The House’s gargantuan 553-page bill is expansive, covering everything from curriculum changes to athletics eligibility for homeschooled students. 
Most notably, the bill would establish education savings accounts, called Magnolia Savings Accounts, that would give parents public dollars to pay for private-school tuition. Parents could also use the money to pay for therapy, homeschooling, or any alternative education services. 
House Republican leaders, including Speaker Jason White, have been pushing for an ESA program, the most expansive form of private school choice available. He said on social media Wednesday that the package “prioritizes freedom, results, and Mississippi’s future workforce.”
Republican Hosemann would not comment on the House bill but said that his chamber would not consider programs that would allow public money to pay for private school education. 
“We have pressed for public education for the last five, now six, years,” he said. “So this is not anything unusual about us continuing to fund education, to fund teachers (with) a pay raise, to ensure that children can go to a school that will give them the particular thing that they want, if it’s accepted by that school district.”

The Senate on Wednesday passed two of its three education bills without much fanfare during its second floor meeting of the session that began Tuesday. This included a $2,000 a year pay raise for teachers, teaching assistants and university and community college professors, estimated to cost $132 million a year.
The final measure, the Senate’s school-choice bill that would remove a home district’s power to veto public school student transfers, passed 33-19, mostly along party lines. Sen. Walter Michel, a Republican from Ridgeland, was the sole Republican dissenting vote.

All of the chamber’s 18 Democratic senators opposed the measures over concerns that only affluent families with the resources required to travel lengthy distances to school districts outside their own would benefit from the policies. They argued that looser enrollment rules would make poorer school districts even poorer while richer school districts continue to gain more resources because students’ state education allotment follows them from school to school. They also expressed fear that expanded school choice could bring a racial resegregation of schools. 
“When students leave, funding leaves soon,” Sen. Derrick Simmons, a Democrat from Greenville, said. “That loss of funding does not come from excess. It comes directly from classrooms. It comes directly from the teachers.” 
DeBar, a Republican from Leakesville, said the Democratic senators’ fears were built on exaggerations, and that the Senate leadership has a strong history of supporting public schools.

Credit: Richard Lake/Mississippi Today
House Education Chairman Rob Roberson, a Republican from Starkville, said he was encouraged by the Senate’s passage of its education measures and hopes it means the two chambers are “slowly but surely coming together on some key issues.”
When asked about the lieutenant governor declaring the Senate was not open to passing voucher legislation, Roberson said he’s seen legislators change their minds on policy positions later in a session.
“I’ve seen many times that the House side has been totally opposed to one thing, and after they’ve had some time to think on it … I’ve seen a total swap in terms of how we look at things,” Roberson said. ” I certainly don’t think anything is ever closed.” 
House leaders have not publicly provided a detailed estimate of the cost of the school choice and other proposals in the new bill, but Roberson said Wednesday that the vouchers would likely be about $7,000 each, the base cost the state now pays for public school students. Providing private school vouchers for 12,500 students, as the bill proposes, would cost $87.5 million.
The chambers do agree on a few points: The behemoth House bill includes much of the Senate’s proposals, including slackened public school transfer regulations and a provision to make it easier for retired state employees to teach without losing pension benefits. 
However, the House bill only includes raises for assistant teachers, and its portability plan for students to switch public schools requires more transparency from the receiving school district. Namely, the receiving districts must publish their admissions criteria and report acceptance data. While rejections must be justified, the Senate version does not require that criteria and data. 
READ MORE: FAQ: What is school choice? What are Mississippi lawmakers considering?
Another significant aspect of the House bill: It expands the literacy act that helped lead to Mississippi’s nationally noted public-school reading improvements. In 2013, lawmakers funneled money and support to the state’s public schools, focusing on kindergarten through the 3rd grade. It famously established a third-grade reading test that students are required to pass to graduate to the next grade, and created and funded a system of reading coaches and training for teachers. The impact was huge — the state’s reading rates shot up, leading national pundits to dub the gains a “Mississippi Miracle.” 
The House’s package expands targeted literacy initiatives to grades 4 through 8, a move for which the Mississippi Department of Education has been pressing. 
The package also advances charter-school expansion, previously shot down by the Senate Education Committee because of poor performance from the state’s existing charter schools. 
Currently, Mississippi law only allows charter schools to be established without board approval in areas with failing school districts. The House proposal widely expands that eligibility. Under the new bill, charter schools could be established in any area, regardless of the public schools’ performance. 
Additionally, the package makes changes to the charter school authorizing board. As it stands, the bill gives the board more authority over opening and closing charters and establishes more rules for the board. 
The package also includes math and financial literacy initiatives, fixes to the state public school funding formula and language encouraging prayer in school. 
The House Education Committee, which met Wednesday, did not take up the omnibus education bill. Instead, the panel of representatives invited a group of parents who were almost all in favor of school choice to speak at a hearing.
Next, the Senate’s education bills head to the House for consideration. The House’s massive education reform package must be considered by the chamber’s education committee before it can be taken up on the floor.

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderRepublicans will maintain their hold over a Cherokee County state House seat after Bill Fincher, a former district attorney, defeated Democrat Scott Sanders during a runoff election Tuesday.
Fincher, who now owns an RV park, received over 70% of the vote according to unofficial results from the secretary of state’s office. He will replace Republican state Rep. Mandi Ballinger of Canton, who died in October after a long battle with cancer. 
In an interview, Fincher said he was “absolutely humbled” by the support of the voters in his district.
Among his top priorities for the 2026 legislative session are capping property taxes, reducing traffic around metro Atlanta and lowering the cost of insurance premiums.
“I’m going to try to get the insurance companies to recognize that we passed tort reform and signed it into law, and we’ve not seen any reduction in our insurance [costs],” Fincher said, referencing two Gov. Brian Kemp-backed bills intended to limit damages Georgia juries can award that passed during the 2025 legislative session. “It should have been something that was a quid pro quo, and we haven’t seen any reduction.”
The district, which includes Canton, part of northern Holly Springs and the surrounding unincorporated areas, heavily favors a Republican. But Democrats hoped to capitalize on growing momentum across the state, having recently flipped two seats on Georgia’s Public Service Commission as well as a House seat in an Athens-area district once thought to be safely under Republican control.
Sanders, a business executive, said making it to the runoff was an accomplishment for a Democrat in such a ruby red district.  
“With every realistic and stretch political goal accomplished, I feel like this campaign was a massive success,” Sanders said in a statement. “And it was fantastic groundwork for the upcoming races in 2026. We made sure that every election will have to be contested and not a giveaway.”
The Legislature will reconvene for the start of the 2026 session on Monday, Jan. 12.

Meanwhile, CT may extend open enrollment past Jan. 31.","With uncertainty in Congress around reviving expired federal health care subsidies, Connecticut officials are considering another extension of open enrollment for 2026 Affordable Care Act plans.
Federal lawmakers are trying different avenues to bring back the enhanced premium subsidies in some form after they lapsed at the end of the year. But depending on what Congress may do over the coming weeks, the state’s marketplace, Access Health CT, said it is in discussions with carriers about potentially extending the final deadline beyond Jan. 31 for another month or two.
The pandemic-era subsidies had been in place since 2021, and because they lapsed, premiums will spike for many this year in Connecticut and across the U.S. The renewal of the Affordable Care Act tax credits had been at the heart of Democrats’ demand during last year’s government shutdown. But when lawmakers brokered a deal to reopen it, they only got a promise of a vote, not a guarantee of extending them.
Even without the enhanced subsidies, more Connecticut residents enrolled. As of Jan. 2, the total number was almost 150,000 enrollees for 2026 plans, which is about 3% to 5% higher than the same period last year, according to Access Health CT CEO James Michel.
“One of the potential changes out there is what the feds are doing. If they do something within the next week or two — in terms of extending the subsidies — then we may have to look at extending [open enrollment] beyond February and March,” Michel said at a Monday press conference alongside Gov. Ned Lamont and Interim Insurance Commissioner Josh Hershman. “We want our customers to come back in, shop, and maybe buy something with more coverage because they will have more subsidy available for them to repurchase.”
All three officials urged residents to enroll in health care and reach out to a broker to see if they qualify for assistance, especially since Connecticut is providing some relief.
The final deadline for open enrollment has already been extended a couple of weeks, until Jan. 31. If an individual or household enrolls in a health or dental plan by the end of the month, coverage will start Feb. 1.
Before the subsidies expired at the end of 2025, Lamont announced the state would step in to fill in some of the gaps through its $500 million emergency response fund set up during the special session to address federal cuts: an initial $70 million for this calendar year, with tens of millions of dollars more slated to cover some in 2027.
The plan will maintain CoveredCT through June 2027. That program provides no-cost plans to low-income families that earn slightly too much to qualify for Medicaid.
Nearly $51 million will go toward replacing the federal subsidy entirely for those who make between 100% and 200% of the Federal Poverty Level. And it will also cover half of the current financial assistance for people earning between 400% and 500% of FPL. The latter will lose all federal assistance now that the enhanced subsidies are gone.
“The consumers in Connecticut that are most vulnerable and in the lowest income class should be made entirely whole based on the gap that was created from the non-extension of the federal subsidies,” Hershman said.
Lamont reiterated that this won’t make up the difference for everyone but will help defray at least some of the costs for health plans that are losing support from the federal government.
Connecticut is one of only a few states offering a subsidy to offset the loss of enhanced federal subsidies. Others include Maryland, California and New Mexico.
“We’re not going to be able to make up all of the federal shortfall forever,” Lamont said. “You’re probably going to see your rates stay the same or even go down for everybody earning up to about $160,000 a year.”
One of those Connecticut residents who could get some relief through the state is Malaine Trecoske from Branford. Trecoske is a 64-year-old who works part-time at a small retail shop and has a year to go before she can qualify for Medicare. For Trecoske and her 63-year-old husband, they would need to pay $42,000 a year to stay on their silver plan now that the enhanced federal subsidy expired.
She said they’re considering what makes most sense for their bottom line: keep their income below 400% of the federal poverty level to still be eligible for some subsidies or earn more money that could put them over 500% but then no longer qualify for assistance.
Because Connecticut will make up about half of the subsidies for those earning between 400% and 500% of FPL, Trecoske said that could cut down what her family owes to about $21,000 for the year — if they remain within that income range. She said she’s thankful the state stepped in, but her premiums would still be costly.
“For us, regardless, it’s a big amount,” Trecoske said at a virtual press conference on Wednesday hosted by U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-3rd District.
For Stephanie Saujon, she and her husband will see an increase of about $1,000 a month in their health care premiums. She’s a self-employed professional photographer in Stratford who’s been in business for 18 years. Saujon said they have to “shuffle things around and budget to afford these premiums.”
But unlike Trecoske, Saujon won’t receive any relief from the state because she’s over the threshold to qualify. She said her business is doing well but was happy to see a fund in place to help others who are struggling. Still, the spike in her premiums “is really not sustainable,” especially as someone with a chronic illness.
“We’re trying to do everything we can with the changing landscape down in Washington,” Lamont said, noting the debate over the subsidies is reminiscent of the back-and-forth over federal nutrition assistance that was imperiled during the government shutdown.
The fate of the expired tax credits remains in flux, though they are once again likely to stall in Congress barring a breakthrough in the Senate.
Democrats’ push for a three-year extension failed to advance in a key Senate vote last month. In the House, Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said he wouldn’t take up such a bill.
But through a procedural tool called a discharge petition, lawmakers were able to force a vote on the House floor this week. All Democrats plus four Republicans signed onto the petition for a three-year extension, garnering the 218 signatures need to trigger a vote.
On Wednesday afternoon, the House was expected to take a procedural vote on the discharge petition to renew the subsidies for three years. If it clears, lawmakers plan to vote on final passage on Thursday. But the Senate is unlikely to take it up since it already blocked such an effort.
That has put pressure on bipartisan groups in the Senate seeking a compromise that may unlock what has been a non-starter for GOP leaders in both chambers. Some of the proposals would renew the subsidies for less than the three years sought by Democrats and could include income limits and other changes to eligibility. One potential deal taking shape would extend the tax credits for two years and impose income caps, according to Politico.
DeLauro said she would support a one- or two-year extension if it meant reviving the enhanced subsidies and seeing some movement in the Senate. But she hopes the final vote in the House on Thursday will create more pressure on GOP senators to reconsider extending the tax credits for another three years.
“This pressure has got to come from public outcry,” DeLauro said Monday. “If the subsidies expire and cuts remain in place, we’re in the midst of our people in Connecticut … living through a cost-of-living crisis.”

She founded Freedom to Read New Mexico last year, which worked with lawmakers on the pending legislation prohibiting book banning at libraries. (Courtesy photos/collage by Danielle Prokop/Source NM)Ahead of the upcoming 30-day legislative session, a state lawmaker has introduced the first in an expected series of proposed bills that would prohibit banning books in public libraries.
State Rep. Kathleen Cates (D-Rio Rancho) pre-filed House Bill 26 last week, which, along with prohibiting book banning, would also require publicly run libraries to establish a procedure for people to challenge library materials “believed to be obscene, unlawful or incompatible with the library’s purpose;” prohibit retaliation against library employees; and would make public libraries ineligible for state funding if they do not follow state law. 
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham will have to explicitly include the issue in her “call” for the session starting Jan. 20, which is otherwise limited to budgetary matters. Her office did not immediately respond to a query about whether she intends to do so.
Cates sponsored a similar bill last year, the Librarian Protection Act, but the proposed legislation failed to make it to the House for a floor vote. Cates told Source New Mexico that HB26 is “almost identical” to the previous bill, but described it as “refined” due to more stakeholder input.
“We wanted some protections on employment for librarians as well, so that’s really our biggest change, is making sure that librarians are not fired or passed over because they’re following their policies rather than political whims,” Cates said. 
The bill also clarifies that the state Department of Cultural Affairs’ library division is responsible for the bill’s enforcement.

Cates said she has received emails from library staff across New Mexico who shared personal stories of threats to themselves and their employment because they followed their respective libraries’ process for challenging books and other material. Local authors have also voiced their experiences with censorship of their published work and calls for removing their books from public library catalogues. 
The Rio Rancho Public Library system faced a challenge to some of their books by a small group in 2023. Much of the criticism focused on books with LGBTQIA themes and characters. The city’s governing body passed a resolution later that year reiterating its support for library staff and stating the procedures for challenging books and other library resources was sufficient. 
“[HB26] is aimed at assisting communities ensure their public libraries maintain free and open access to information free from political influences; and would protect librarians who have dedicated their lives’ to upholding the First Amendment,” Jason Shoup, Rio Rancho library director, told Source in a written statement.
Sen. Antoinette Sedillo Lopez (D-Albuquerque) told Source she is working on a similar bill to address prohibiting book banning in K-12 public school libraries. A third expected bill would address academic libraries tied to public universities and colleges.
Kit Rosewater, a middle-grade and young adult author based in Albuquerque, told Source that her debut middle-grade novel, “The Derby Daredevils: Kenzie Kickstarts A Team,” was challenged in Staten Island, New York, after it was added to the curriculum for all New York City public schools. 
“They didn’t burn books, but basically they raided their school library and took out a bunch of books by marginalized authors with marginalized characters and content and they kind of like ceremoniously threw them into this giant dumpster,” Rosewater said. Her book was included because Rosewater identifies as queer and the novel has a transgender character. 
In New Mexico, Rosewater was scheduled to host an author visit and writing workshop at a public Albuquerque elementary school in September 2025, but a group of parents disapproved and protested. “They had, I would say, about a five- or six-week harassment campaign against me that unfortunately was targeted completely at the librarian who had invited me,” she said. “I felt like the librarian was getting really nervous…so ultimately I was the one to cancel the event just for everybody’s safety.”
Rosewater described this instance as “soft censorship,” or actions taken against books and authors that are outside of the formal challenging process. “We want people to know that it is an issue here. This isn’t kind of some niche thing that we’re bringing over from some other area.  All the people who are behind this legislation and this work, we’re all very deeply kind of plugged into what’s happening in New Mexico, in schools and libraries,” she said.
Rosewater connected with the anti-censorship organization Grandparents and Allies for Truth and began reaching out to other advocacy groups to form a coalition. Freedom to Read New Mexico officially launched in November 2025 with Rosewater as chair. She and representatives of other coalition members have since worked with lawmakers to shape HB26 and the other two pending book banning bills.
“New Mexico is an extremely diverse state in terms of how different counties, regions, towns all operate. And so we really needed to kind of connect with each other about what was going to work best for New Mexico as a state versus any one particular school or library or even city,” Rosewater said. “We feel that [HB26 is] extremely timely and there’s just no way we can just sit on our hands and let this session pass us by without at least trying to get it on the call list.”
She added that states across the country have acted recently to pass anti-book ban legislation. According to American Libraries, nine states have passed such legislation since 2023, with an additional five states passing bills in 2025.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Banned-Book-illustration-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-07 16:59:12.678536

Jeff Raatz, R-Richmond, presides over Indiana's Senate Education Committee on Wednesday, Jan. 7, 2026. (Photo by Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Legislation requiring schools to more strictly limit student cellphone use cleared a key Senate committee Wednesday after being amended to protect students with medical needs.
Senate Bill 78, authored by committee chairman Sen. Jeff Raatz, R-Richmond, passed in a 12-1 vote and now heads to the full Senate chamber. 
The measure would require all public schools to adopt a ban that prohibits students from using or possessing a wireless communication device during the school day and requires that any teacher-directed use of a device “for educational purposes” occur only on school-supplied devices.
It also mandates that each district choose between two enforcement models: a “no device policy,” in which students may not bring phones to school at all; or a “secure storage policy,” in which students may bring phones but must store them so they are “inaccessible throughout the school day.”


The education committee on Wednesday also discussed legislation that seeks to revive proposed limitations on social media use for Hoosier children. A similar proposal passed the Senate in 2025 but died in the House. Amendments and a vote on the bill could come as early as next week.


The bill expands the definition of “wireless communication device” to include smartwatches connected to a phone, cell tower or the Internet.
Under current state law, students are prohibited from using phones during instructional time, but they can use them during lunch and passing periods.
Sen. J.D. Ford, D-Indianapolis, cast the lone no vote, though he said he could change his mind as the bill moves forward. All other Democrats on the committee joined Republicans in supporting the measure. Sen. Fady Qaddoura, D-Indianapolis, said he had some concerns but ultimately backed the legislation, calling it “good policy.”
The amended bill also clarifies that school cellphone policies cannot block students from using devices when necessary to manage a documented medical condition, so long as the student has an order from a licensed Indiana health care provider. Raatz cited students who rely on phones for diabetes monitoring, for example.
Supporters testified in December that stronger technology policies are needed because the rapid proliferation of smartphones has outpaced school rules and fueled student distractions and behavioral issues. 
Some districts already use secure “bell-to-bell” storage systems, like locking pouches, during the school day. That process typically requires students to turn off or place their phone on airplane mode, secure it in the pouch under staff supervision, store it in a backpack or locker during the day, and unlock it at dismissal.

(Photo by Will Price/West Virginia Legislative Photography)West Virginia Sen. Mike Woelfel, a Democrat representing Cabell County, will not run for reelection this year, he said Wednesday. 
Woelfel, an attorney, was first elected to the Senate in 2014. He’s in his third term as senator. 
“I didn’t really ever plan to be there 12 years,” he told West Virginia Watch. “I thought maybe one or two terms at the most. So I think it’s just maybe time to turn the page and let somebody else have a crack at it. So that’s what motivated me to just make a decision.”
During some legislative sessions, Woelfel has introduced bills that would limit terms for lawmakers, but the bills have not moved, he said. He said Wednesday he plans to re-introduce the legislation next week. The 60-day legislative session begins Jan. 14. 
“I just feel like you shouldn’t be in there forever,” Woelfel said.
Woelfel is the assistant minority leader for the Democrats. He’s one of only two members of his party in the 34-member Senate. 
In his final session, Woelfel said he hopes that lawmakers will pass legislation aimed at improving West Virginia’s overburdened foster care system. Around 6,000 children are in foster care in the state. 
“As we both know, those children are in there, in foster care through no fault of their own,” he said. “And we’ve let them down. The system is broken. I expect to put a lot of effort into legislation that would help repair that system.”
According to WSAZ News, Chris Miller, a West Virginia businessman who ran unsuccessfully for governor in 2024, announced Wednesday he would run for Woelfel’s district 5 seat this year. Miller, a Republican, could not be reached Wednesday for comment. 
Miller is the son of U.S. Rep. Carol Miller, R-W.Va. He owns multiple car dealerships in the region. He lost to now-Gov. Patrick Morrisey in the 2024 primary election. 
The official candidate filing period begins Monday and continues through the end of the month. 
The primary election is May 12 and the general election is Nov. 3.

Education development games for school toddlers kids (Photo by Vanessa Nunes/Getty Images)OKLAHOMA CITY — An Oklahoma state agency is accepting proposals to open a five-story child care facility at a building near the Capitol that would “offer priority for admission, at all times, to children of State of Oklahoma employees.”
The Oklahoma Office of Management and Enterprise Services is investing over $45 million legislatively appropriated dollars into renovating a building on the Capitol Complex, located at 2409 N. Kelley Ave., which will be turned into a facility for 250 children, from infants to 5-year olds. Proposals are being accepted through Feb. 20. 
This comes as Oklahoma, which is considered a child care desert, faces a shortage of qualified workers and lawmakers continue to grapple with finding solutions. 
A rendering of the building on Kelley Avenue, a future child care facility, in Oklahoma City is pictured. (Screenshot)
The Legislature originally began planning for the project in 2023, appropriating money to OMES “to accept transfer of the Kelley Building and Kelley Annex owned by the Department of Human Services and renovate the facilities for lease to a public operator as a day care facility,” according to the bill language. 
The appropriation does not pay for day-to-day expenses of the child care facility, only renovations. 
Bonnie Campo, a spokesperson for OMES, said in a statement that a vendor that was previously awarded the contract withdrew in November for “financial reasons.”
Demolition is complete at the Kelley Building and Annex, Campo said, but work continues on the annex mechanical, electrical and framing systems. 
“When completed, the main building will serve as office space for state agencies, and the annex will serve as a day care facility for state employees,” she said in a statement. “All renovation is scheduled to be completed by August 2026. However, opening the facility is contingent on selecting an operator.”
The building currently houses the Child Support Enforcement Division, which will be moved, Campo said. 
OMES would be charged with renovating the building, providing fencing for an outdoor playground area, building maintenance, utilities, lawn care, pest control and other related services, according to the request for proposals. 
The operator of the proposed child care facility would be responsible for hiring and paying employees and the other day-to-day expenses of running a child care center. 
They would also need to provide interior furnishings, liability insurance, equipment for both an indoor and outdoor play area, janitorial services, and other similar responsibilities. 
Rep. Daniel Pae, R-Lawton, said he wasn’t aware of OMES’ request for proposals as of Wednesday morning. Pae is the vice chair of the House Committee on Children, Youth and Family Services. 
“When it comes to state employees, specifically, they do a lot of tremendous work to keep operations functioning and oftentimes they’re not paid as competitively as they ought to be, compared to their peers and other industries,” he said. “So we want to make sure that they’re taken care of.”
The cost of child care has grown nationwide and COVID-era subsidies in Oklahoma have been cut, raising costs for families across the state. Some providers have voiced their concerns about how the loss of subsidies could lead to more child care centers closing their doors. 
“I think in the current economy, if we’re going to truly maximize our potential as a state, to meet our workforce needs, we have to address child care,” he said.

(Main photo by Douglas Sacha of Getty Images; Story County Sheriff's Office insignia courtesy of Story County)Story County officials have agreed to pay $75,000 to settle a lawsuit brought by a former deputy who alleged harassment and discrimination in the sheriff’s office.
The lawsuit involved former county deputy Ashley Murry, who sued the Story County Sheriff’s Office and deputies Kyle Thompson, Leanna Ellis, Nathan Gruis, Adam Luke and Cody Hamilton in Story County District Court.
Murry, who worked as a deputy sheriff from April 2022 to November 2023, alleged she was the target of harassment from her supervisors and her coworkers, and was subjected to unwelcome derogatory and crude comments and insults that created a hostile work environment.
Murry alleged that after she was hired, and prior to leaving for training at the Iowa Law Enforcement Academy, Ellis instructed her to “keep your legs closed” while at the academy.
The lawsuit also alleged that during field training, Murry was required to handle a disproportionately higher number of calls compared to her male counterparts and that she was subjected to negative stereotypes associated with female officers, with her male colleagues telling her she wasn’t assertive enough and was bad at driving.
Murry also claimed that during work hours, the male deputies — including Hamilton, Luke and Gruis — would “sit in dispatch or in the office and watch football and yell profanities.”
The lawsuit alleged that during the annual sexual harassment and discrimination training for the staff, male deputies called a female colleague a “lesbian that could fix go-karts.”
There were also “many occasions that her male co-workers refused to provide” Murry with backup, jeopardizing her safety, the lawsuit claimed. In June 2023, Murry allegedly initiated a traffic stop in which the driver called four male associates to the scene. The four men allegedly drove to the location of the traffic stop and ignored Murry’s instructions to remain in their vehicles, prompting her to call for backup. The lawsuit claims Hamilton was available at the time, but refused to assist Murry, later telling her “sometimes you have to handle things on your own.”
While responding to a different incident in which an individual pulled out a large knife, Murry twice called dispatch for backup “but no one ever came to assist her,” the lawsuit alleged, adding that Ellis later berated Murry for her handling of the situation and told her she needed to be “more assertive.”
In September 2023, Thompson allegedly informed Murry a statistical analysis of her use of sick time showed a “suspicious” use of sick days on Mondays and Fridays, and allegedly referred to Murry as a “buddy f—er.”
The lawsuit, which was first filed in August 2024, alleged that the “hostile work environment and constant degradation” gave Murry no other option but to resign in November 2023.
The county and its co-defendants denied any wrongdoing and stated in court they “did not discriminate at any time against (Murry) nor did they harass” her.
According to the written settlement agreement in the case, Murray has agreed to drop all claims against the defendants in exchange for $75,000.
Settlement bars former deputy from disclosing terms
In October, before the agreement was formally approved, the Iowa Capital Dispatch requested a copy of the document. At the time, Assistant County Attorney Crystal Rink stated that “the requested record is a privileged attorney-client communication and is confidential.”
The Capital Dispatch responded by providing Rink with a “No Secret Settlements” advisory from the attorney general’s office that says under Iowa law, “in government, settlements are not secret,” and that “public disclosure is the rule, and confidentiality is the exception.”
On Oct. 31, 2025, Rink then responded by stating the county “does not possess a final, binding, written settlement agreement” in the case.
On Jan. 7, 2026, the Capital Dispatch renewed its request for the document, noting that Murry’s lawsuit had been dismissed by the court on Jan. 5, 2026, at the request of her attorney. That same day, Rink provided the Capital Dispatch with a copy of the settlement indicating it was signed and approved by the county board on Nov. 7, 2025.
The settlement includes a confidentiality provision that bars Murry from publishing its contents “on any social media or internet site or to any news media outlet.” The provision also allows Story County to “discuss or provide information internally” on the settlement or to comply with open records laws.

Jim Justice, R-W.Va., is joining a bipartisan coalition of U.S. senators in introducing legislation that aims to make farmers safer by preventing fatal tractor rollovers, according to a news release. 
According to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 417 farmers died nationally between 2011 and 2018 due to tractor rollovers. Five of those fatalities — one each in 2011 and 2012 and three in 2013 — occurred in West Virginia, per the data.
The proposed legislation — dubbed the Roll-Over Prevention and Safety Act — would require the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture to create cost-sharing grants to assist farmers in retrofitting older tractors with rollbars and other equipment that could prevent passengers from being fatally crushed or injured by tractor rollovers. It would also start a federal grant program to help farmers as well as agricultural schools add rollover protection to their equipment. If passed as-is, the federal government could pay up to 70% of the costs needed to purchase, ship and install rollbars and seatbelts on existing tractors.
Per research from Kansas State University, there are nearly 5 million tractors used regularly on farms across the country, but only half of them are equipped with rollover protection structures. When rollover protections are in place, they’re estimated to reduce fatalities by nearly 99% when rollovers occur.
Tractor rollovers are considered to be one of the leading causes of death and injury within the agricultural sector. In 1985, American tractor manufacturers adopted voluntary standards to include rollover protection structures on all newly created tractors. Many farmers, however, use older and outdated equipment without these protections.
In 2017, the National Rollover Protection Structure Rebate Program launched, allowing farmers in several states to receive up to 70% back for the price of ordering and installing rollbars on their equipment. Industry groups have been advocating for nationwide funding to support the program for several years. 
In a news release Wednesday, Justice said he personally knows how critical it is to protect farmers since he himself is one. In July 2025, he told members of the Senate Agriculture Committee that his family “has been in the farming business for 7,000 years.”
“This bill is one simple way we can help decrease the risk of fatal tractor rollovers on farms,” Justice said in Wednesday’s release. “I’m proud to support the effort in the Senate and hope that this grant program will encourage more farmers to consider retrofitting their tractors with roll bars to protect themselves and their equipment operators.”
Other Senators introducing the legislation alongside Justice include: Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga.; Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Co. and Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, R-Miss.

“We know that (one size fits all) mandates fail,” McMahon said. “States should lead. Washington should support their sound approaches and get out of the way. That’s why the Trump administration is granting Iowa this flexibility. And we hope that as we partner with congressional leaders to return education to the states, we can work with them to expand these opportunities for states and local leaders to run their education systems.”
Iowa had submitted a waiver in March to receive nearly $157 million in federal education funding through block grants that would have allowed the state to allocate this funding outside of federal Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) requirements. While the approved waiver covered a much smaller portion of federal education funding, Gov. Kim Reynolds said the “Returning Education to the States” waiver is the “first step” toward implementing the larger plan.

Kim Reynolds, left, and Iowa Department of Education Director McKenzie Snow, right, on approving a state waiver for Iowa to change some federal education spending requirements. (Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)
McMahon had requested in 2025 that states submit applications for waivers allowing more flexibility in federal education spending, and Iowa was the first state to apply for the spending rules exemption.
Iowa’s proposed “unified allocation plan” proposed giving the state the ability to more effectively address education needs in the state and reduce administrative costs, Reynolds argued in September, and said state testing scores show Iowa’s education system was in a good place to take on these funds with less federal regulation.
The waiver announced Wednesday has a much smaller scope than the state’s initial proposal, making changes to reporting and spending requirements in three areas, state Education Secretary McKenzie Snow said.
Four ESEA federal educational funds — Title II Part A, dealing with professional development, Title III Part A dealing with English language learning , and Title IV, Parts A and B covering student support and community learning centers — are consolidated into a single. state-level block grant. This block grant, which totaled roughly $3.8 million for federal fiscal years 2024 and 2025, is proposed to go toward funding professional development for the state’s “science of reading” approach to literacy development as well as for providing all teachers professional development courts on teaching English language learners.
McMahon said a majority of the funding through this $9.5 million block grant is currently going toward complying with federal regulations, according to state estimates.
“If we were operating under the old rules, it would take — according to the figures that were done in the state — about $8 million to comply with the regulation of this $9.5 million dollar grant,” McMahon said. “So in essence, you get about a million-and-a-half dollars to go to the schools. With this new waiver, that $8 million will go to the schools. That’s a big number.”
The proposal also “streamlines” certain reporting and compliance processes, which the officials said will open up both time and money currently being spent by schools and the state on following federal regulations. Additionally, the waiver allows the Iowa Department of Education to give local school districts that receive federal funding from these pools “targeted local flexibilities” in how this money is spent, Snow said.
This will provide school districts, especially smaller, rural districts, the ability to “purposefully plan” their spending and invest in higher quality instructional material, more intensive tutoring options and other needed education supports, officials said.
McMahon made the announcement during a visit to Iowa Wednesday, joined by Reynolds and Snow. The group toured classrooms of Broadway Elementary School alongside local school officials, including Denison Schleswig Community School District Superintendent Kim Buryanek. The Denison elementary school is a dual language school, and the officials went to classrooms where students were learning both English and Spanish, as well as STEM and language arts classes.
Reynolds said the Denison school showcases the importance of investments in English learning and “science of reading” instruction. A 2024 law that focused on bringing K-6 students not reading at grade-level proficiency up to literacy benchmarks resulted in increased third-grade literacy rates statewide, Reynolds said. She cited an “especially inspiring” jump from 65% to 72% at Broadway Elementary School.
“That is a 7% increase, and that number continues to rise,” Reynolds said. “It shows the power of evidence-based instruction in schools, and school districts’ commitment to it. All the K- through 5th-grade teachers in Denison are completing their second year of letters training in the ‘science of reading,’ and fully embrace this approach.
“Our progress also says a lot about Iowa, about the dedication of our teachers and administrators, their collaboration with the Iowa Department of Education and our family’s engagement and student success,” Reynolds added. “But these improvements shouldn’t be limited to the state level, and that’s why I really appreciate that Secretary McMahon and her team are focused on supporting the right work. Work like the science of reading and work-based learning, which truly makes a difference for our students.”

Luke Clippinger (D-Baltimore City). (File Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)A prominent member of the House of Delegates has abruptly replaced his campaign treasurer amid concerns that she misappropriated money from his campaign account.
Del. Luke Clippinger (D-Baltimore City) told Maryland Matters he replaced Melissa Evans after being alerted to questions about $44,000 in checks written on his account and allegedly cashed by Evans.
“I am shocked and disappointed at this betrayal of trust by the treasurer of my campaign committee,” said Clippinger, the former chair of the House Judiciary Committee who was recently named speaker pro tem, the No. 2 position in the House. “I will immediately retain an accounting professional to review the treasurer’s management of my campaign account.”
Clippinger added that he has forwarded the matter to the Office of the State Prosecutor.
In a brief phone call, Clippinger referenced the open investigation and referred a reporter back to his statement.
Evans, who according to her online profile is currently employed with the Baltimore County Public Library system, did not immediately respond to a request by phone for comment.

Maryland Matters contacted Maryland State Board of Elections officials seeking clarification about Evans and her relationship with the campaign. The questions arose over 15 checks totaling $44,000 that were drawn on the account of Friends of Luke Clippinger. The checks were written over a four year period between 2020 and 2024.
All of the checks provided to Maryland Matters were made out to Evans, who appears to have endorsed the checks and deposited them into bank accounts she controlled. The checks range in amounts from $500 to two for $10,000. One of the checks was a bank check drawn on the Clippinger campaign account payable to Melissa Evans.
Evans had been Clippinger’s campaign treasurer since 2013.
Typically, campaigns do not pay their treasurers. Maryland campaign law allows for payments but requires a written agreement to be approved by the board of elections as treasurers are legally the only officer allowed to disburse funds.
A board of elections official Tuesday confirmed that no such agreement existed in the agency’s records.
Clippinger, in a statement, told Maryland Matters that board officials contacted him following that inquiry. It was then that he discovered “there were at least four checks written in the past month by my treasurer that were not authorized and not legitimate campaign expenditures.”
Those checks appear to be in addition to the $44,000 in checks obtained by Maryland Matters.
On Monday, Evans was listed as treasurer for Clippinger’s campaign.
A day later, her name had been removed. Sophia Silbergeld, who has worked as a fundraiser for Clippinger, is now listed as treasurer.

(Photo by Jesus Vargas/Getty Images)President Donald Trump is unlikely to see many U.S. oil companies jump in response to his call to invest in Venezuela for the foreseeable future, industry experts say.
With low oil prices and better drilling opportunities elsewhere — along with the legally fraught idea of taking a sanctioned foreign nation’s natural resources — it would take several years,  a shifting geopolitical landscape and either higher demand or a disruption to existing supplies before there’s any significant expansion into Venezuela, according to two energy sector economists and a former federal official and lawyer who specialized in oil industry investigations. 
Following surprise military strikes on Caracas early Saturday and U.S. forces capturing its autocratic leader, Nicolas Maduro, Trump and several of his cabinet members have focused the public’s attention on Venezuela’s oil. The South American country is believed to have one of the world’s largest proven reserves of crude oil, which Trump has suggested could be extracted by American fossil fuel interests.
“We’re going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure and start making money for the country,” Trump said in a televised address Saturday morning.  
Estimates place Venezuela’s reachable oil reserves at roughly 2.3 billion barrels, which is the equivalent of 100 billion gallons, according to the Baker Institute for Energy Studies at Rice University.   
The political and logistical details of extracting and refining Venezuela’s oil is more complex than Trump’s depiction. For one, the price of oil is currently too low for all but the largest oil majors to expand their drilling and exploration, said David Dismukes, an economist and professor emeritus at the Center for Energy Studies at Louisiana State University.
Overall, 2025 was a sluggish year for the oil industry with crude prices starting at an average $79 per barrel in January and steadily losing ground due to an oversupply through the year, closing out December at $63 per barrel. The going rate sat at $57 per barrel as of Tuesday. 
These prices are for benchmark crude, the “light” version that is more easily refined into finished petroleum products. The “heavy” crude oil from Venezuela typically trades $5 to $10 per barrel less than the benchmark rate, making it less valuable for exploration companies.
“We’re not running out of drilling opportunities in the U.S.,” Dismukes said.
Even if an oil company has the desire and resources to expand into South America, other countries such as Brazil offer virtually all the same potential benefits with none of the baggage of Venezuela, Baton Rouge-based economist Loren Scott said. 
“The evidence is clear on that,” Scott said. “Offshore Brazil is extremely active right now.” 
Dismukes said oil prices have largely moved “sideways” for the past few months, with small upticks quickly followed by small contractions. Absent financial incentives, the current numbers aren’t enough for most companies to start new drilling operations, particularly in a foreign country such as Venezuela, he added.
“The global market for energy is just really soft right now,” Dismukes said. “It’s just not really good timing right now to do something like that.” 
In the face of such skepticism, Trump has floated the idea of giving federal subsidies to oil companies to cover the cost of their expansions into Venezuela.
“A tremendous amount of money will have to be spent, and the oil companies will spend it, and then they’ll get reimbursed by us or through revenue,” Trump told NBC News on Monday.
The oil and gas industry is already heavily subsidized and is set to receive over $34.8 billion per year in federal handouts, thanks in part to the enactment of Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill, according to a report from Oil Change International, a group that opposes fossil fuel subsidies. More than $1 billion of that goes strictly to the costs of drilling new wells under a decades-old subsidy, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. 
Throughout his campaign, Trump said he would unleash American energy “dominance” with new drilling across the U.S., promising to bring gasoline prices below $2 per gallon. Gasoline prices have been trending downward since July 2022 and saw a $0.25 cent drop over the 2025 calendar year. The nationwide average sits at $2.81 per gallon as of Wednesday.
Generally, when oil prices fall, consumers benefit from cheaper fuel. But the profit margin shrinks for oil companies, often leading to production shutdowns and sometimes layoffs or bankruptcies. It is especially pronounced for companies in Democratic nations compared with state-controlled oil producers in authoritarian countries such as Saudi Arabia and Russia that have, in the past, flooded the market with an oversupply of oil to manipulate prices and drive western competitors out of business.
Per-barrel oil prices in the low $50 range are unsustainable for most oil producers, and new exploration and drilling typically only starts when prices climb above $80 per barrel, Scott said. 
“It’s not a happy price right now for people in the oil industry,” Scott said.
Gov. Jeff Landry, a close Trump ally, was quick to praise the president’s strategy in an editorial he penned Monday for Breitbart News. The governor claimed that a “successful reboot” of Venezuela would have a “tremendous impact” on Louisiana’s economy and create high-paying jobs at the state’s ports and refineries.
The largest concentration of refineries with the capability to process Venezuela’s heavy crude are in Louisiana and Texas. The 15 crude oil refineries in Louisiana can process nearly 3 million barrels of crude oil per day, which accounts for one-sixth of U.S. refining capacity, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Texas can handle 6.3 million barrels daily, providing a third of the nation’s refining.
A new stream of heavy crude could prove beneficial for certain U.S. refineries that use it as a blending agent to process light crude, according to Mark Zappi, a petroleum engineer who heads the Energy Institute of Louisiana at the University of Louisiana-Lafayette.
Many Gulf Coast refineries were originally built to handle heavy crude and later modified to process light crude as domestic drilling ramped up. Some still require a supply of heavy crude to operate, and most of it is imported from Canada, Zappi said.
Having a second source of this feedstock is generally good for reducing refining costs and at least would provide flexibility for times of uncertainty like when major weather events disrupt supply chains, he said.
“The only thing you can count on in the energy arena is not being able to count on anything,” Zappi said.
While there is some potential for Trump’s vision, experts say it will likely take many years to have any sizable impact on the Gulf Coast oil sector or the American economy. 
“It’s gonna take a while for this to happen — years,” Dismukes said. “It’s not gonna be a big opportunity that people are jumping up and down about.”
While Venezuela has large oil reserves, it can only produce a maximum of about 1 million barrels per day with its current infrastructure. The U.S. currently produces about 13.5 million barrels per day from domestic drilling, according to federal data.  
There are also complex legal issues at play when it comes to extracting the natural resources of a foreign nation, said Braden Perry, a compliance officer and former senior trial attorney at the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The federal agency investigates crimes related to trading on energy markets, cryptocurrencies and other commodities.
Companies would need express permission from the Venezuelan government or a clear United Nations Security Council mandate to legally extract any oil from within Venezuela’s borders, Perry said. Without either of those, it would be a violation of international laws governing state sovereignty, he added. 
Even if the Trump administration gets permission, American oil companies could run into a number of other compliance issues with other markets or governments. One potential choke point is the reluctance insurers might have to underwrite operations that might trigger penalties, including existing European Union sanctions on Venezuela. 
Insurance companies cover their own risks through the reinsurance market, most of which is based in the United Kingdom and European Union, which often imposes much stricter exclusions than American underwriters, Perry said.
Maduro, whom the U.S. and other nations refused to recognize as the legitimate president of Venezuela, still has his vice president and the rest of his administration running the country. Opposition leaders in Venezuela might challenge any drilling permits or agreements offered by the current government, further complicating the situation and the risk for investors.
“So it’s not simply a technical or geological issue, it’s geopolitical and legal,” Perry said. “These markets are not only controlled by regulators, but also by insurance, banks, reinsurers, and exchanges.”
In a social media post Tuesday night, Trump claimed Venezuela’s interim government authorities have agreed to turn over 30 million to 50 million barrels of “sanctioned oil.” It will be shipped to the U.S. and sold at market prices, and the U.S. president would hold onto the money on behalf of the Venezuelan people, Trump wrote.  
Perry said it’s unclear what Trump means by “sanctioned oil” but that any Venezuelan-origin crude would be blocked from sale unless the sanctions are lifted.  
“I presume there could be some executive or legal order as part of the plan, but that is unclear,” Perry said. 
The president has broad authority to lift sanctions that have been imposed through executive orders, but some of the actions against Venezuela are congressional sanctions that require legislative approval to lift or amend them.
“Sanctioned oil doesn’t become marketable by announcement,” Perry said. “This will be a complicated process to provide formal sanctions relief, ensuring the market — and shippers, financiers and insurers — is comfortable and has mitigated the real risk associated with the purchase of Venezuelan oil.”
As for setting up shop in Venezuela, Dismukes, the LSU economist, suggested that if a new government forms there, it will likely take years before investors are confident it won’t devolve into authoritarianism. The U.S. could offer some sort of financial securities and incentives, but the potential benefits would still need to be greater than what’s already available in other places, he said. 
Some degree of geopolitical stabilization needs to happen before oil companies will want to invest or expand into Venezuela, Scott added.
Venezuela began the nationalization of its oil industry in the 1970s under President Carlos Andrés Pérez, who negotiated the transition with companies such as Exxon, Chevron and Shell. In the mid-2000s, President Hugo Chavez seized assets from several foreign oil companies, some of which continue to wage legal battles against the country to recover their losses. 
Only Chevron has remained there to operate, with Venezuela accounting for less than 10% of its overall global production, according to company figures. Chevron’s partnership with the state-owned oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A., accounts for nearly one-fourth of the nation’s output.
“Stabilization is the first key,” Scott said. “That’s critical … How do you give oil companies the confidence to go back in there, to say you don’t have to worry about somebody coming and taking your stuff?”

SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. — Greetings from Arizona, where the old saying is that it’s so dry, you’d think the air is on a diet.
Seriously, this part of Arizona gets about 8-9 inches of rain annually and only about 30 days when there is any precipitation at all. The average January rainfall is less than an inch.
Well, guess what? Ole Miss plays Miami in the Fiesta Bowl Thursday night, and we may get that much rain – or more – that one day. Heavy thunderstorms are predicted.
Now then, it probably will not affect the game that much even though State Farm Stadium in nearby Glendale has a natural turf (Bermuda grass) field. State Farm Stadium has a retractable dome, which surely will be closed Thursday. The weather will affect tailgating. And it will be colder than normal. And those Mississippians coming in for just the day of the game should prepare accordingly. If the weather forecasters are accurate, it will be damp and cold.
Tailgating way outside the Grove
Speaking of tailgating (and perhaps soaked tailgaters), the National Football Foundation annually hosts one of the largest tailgating festivals in college football in conjunction with the Fiesta Bowl. It is held on The Great Lawn, a short walk from the stadium and is normally attended by thousands. The Ole Miss band and cheerleaders will participate. We are told there will be live entertainment of all sorts, some of both Miami’s and Ole Miss’s most famous football alums attending, plus photo booths, lawn games and team trivia contests. Again, raincoats and umbrellas are suggested.

‘I just felt like Ole Miss was home’
Asked how difficult his decision was to return Ole Miss next year (pending a waiver from the NCAA) quarterback Trinidad Chambliss responded: “It was a little bit of a hard decision because Coach (Charlie) Weis was always good to me. I had a great relationship with him throughout the whole season.As well as Coach (Lane) Kiffin, he’s been nothing but good to me. But I just felt like Ole Miss was home,and I felt like it was the right thing to do, and I felt comfortable being here. The Oxford community has beennothing but good to me and my family with the support and love that they have shown to everyoneon the team.”

Smiling since he was born
An observation: The national media, many seeing and hearing Chambliss for the first time up close and personal, seem totally smitten. As one national website reporter asked: “Is Trinidad this gracious and forthcoming all the time?”
Part of Chambliss’s charm is an ear-to-ear smile he flashes almost every time he answers a question. Joe Soules, Chambliss’s high school basketball coach, was asked by a reporter about that smile. “You can’t wipe it off,” Soules said. “It’s been there since he was born.”
No doubt that effervescent smile will serve Chambliss well in life, whether it is at Ole Miss next season, or in the NFL or whatever else he chooses do.
Remembering a talented Millsaps QB
Millsaps quarterback Juan Joseph won the C Spire Conerly Trophy back in 2008, causing quite the controversy. Michael Oher and Peria Jerry of Ole Miss were the other finalists, and many were incensed that media voters would choose a Division III player over SEC standouts. That was even though Joseph led the Majors to an 11-1 record that season, running and throwing for nearly 4,000 yards and 38 touchdowns.
Miami offensive coordinator Shannon Dawson remembers Joseph ever so well. He was Joseph’s position coach and offensive coordinator for two seasons at Millsaps.
“Great player, great kid from a great family,” Dawson said here Tuesday at Fiesta Bowl Media Day.

Given that Ole Miss quarterback Trinidad Chambliss came from Division II Ferris State and has become one of the most famous players in college football today, I asked Dawson: “What about Juan Joseph? Would his talent have translated to this level of football. Could he have played in ACC or SEC?”
“Oh yeah,” Dawson answered. “He could have played. No doubt about it. Juan could have played anywhere.”
Joseph was tragically shot and killed in 2014 while he was trying to break up a fight outside a Baton Rouge nightclub. Millsaps still presents the Juan Joseph Memorial Award annually “to the most outstanding returning football student-athlete that exemplifies the altruistic spirit on and off the field that Joseph exhibited in his life.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/20185526/AP25355020748731.jpg,,,2026-01-07 15:58:24.324298

Photo courtesy of Pacific Legal Foundation. The U.S. Supreme Court will hear oral arguments next month in a case against Michigan’s Isabella County that alleges the county violated the constitutional rights of a Michigan family when it seized and sold the family’s home as a tax foreclosure penalty for nearly $120,000 below its assessed value. 
The Pung family home was seized by the county over an unpaid $2,242 tax debt, which was owed after a property tax exemption was not applied to the property for several years. 
The tax exemption had been granted to Timothy Scott Pung, who bought the home in the 1990s and lived there with his family until his death in 2004, after which point his son Marc and his family moved into the home. Lawyers for the Pung family argue that, under Michigan law, the tax exemption should have automatically been applied, as the property was staying within the family. 
But the local tax assessor disagreed, and as foreclosure proceedings continued, the house was eventually sold at a public auction for about $76,000. The assessed market value of the house was over $194,000 at the time.

After the Pungs sued, a federal district court ruled that the family should be granted the amount that the house sold for minus the owed tax, just under $74,000. The Sixth Circuit Court agreed with this, writing, “when a municipality sells foreclosed property at a properly conducted public auction, the owner is entitled to the amount of the sale above his debt and no more.”
But the Pungs are now arguing that the failure of the county to pay the family the over $118,000 between the auction price and the market value of the home amounts to an excessive fine, in violation of the Eighth Amendment, and is not “just compensation” as is required by the Fifth Amendment. 
“The simple way of thinking about it is that you have, in this case, a situation where the government took, confiscated an entire home as payment for a debt that never should have been imposed in the first place,” said Christina Martin, a senior attorney for the Pacific Legal Foundation, which is representing the Pungs alongside Michigan attorney Phil Ellison. “It was wrongly imposed, and they should pay for the whole thing they took.”
The county, however, argues that if the court rules in favor of the Pung family, it would make tax foreclosure no longer a viable way to collect unpaid taxes. 
“If the former property owners are entitled to more than surplus proceeds actually yielded by the sale, tax foreclosure becomes a moneylosing proposition,” a brief filed by the county’s lawyers explains. “Foreclosure would become nonviable as a means of tax collection — with no readily apparent alternative means for timely collection of the delinquent revenue.” 
The legal team for the Pung estate breaks down the money that they argue is owed, labeled as “uncompensated equity,” from the sale of the home in question. Screenshot of court filing.
But Martin said that this case is more about property rights than about taxes, with someone’s home often being their most important asset.
“I’ve always seen this as a property rights case, and I don’t view it as a tax case, because this was never about tax collection. If it were, they knew Pung was good for the money,” she said, referencing the fact that Pung was paying a legal team at that point. “I don’t really think this was ever about tax collection. I think it was about taking the whole property.”
The county’s lawyers also reference that taxes are not a “taking” under the Fifth Amendment, and that “the Eighth Amendment Excessive Fines Clause should apply only against monetary penalty or property forfeiture imposed as punishment following conviction for a criminal offense,” arguing that both constitutional arguments made by the Pungs’ legal team are invalid.
The oral arguments are scheduled to take place on Feb. 25.

(Photo by Getty Images) (This image cannot be republished without a Getty subscription.)OKLAHOMA CITY — The Presidential Fitness Test could return to Oklahoma schools to evaluate students’ physical performance, under a state Senate bill and a nationwide executive order.
Sen. Adam Pugh, R-Edmond, announced Wednesday he filed legislation that would bring the physical fitness test back to public schools statewide, aligning with an executive order from President Donald Trump. Pugh leads two Senate committees on education and is a Republican candidate for state superintendent of public schools.
At the time it was eliminated in 2012, the Presidential Fitness Test included a one-mile run, sit-ups, a shuttle run, a sit-and-reach test, and pull-ups or push-ups.
Oklahoma school districts would have to implement the test starting in the 2026-27 academic year if Pugh’s Senate Bill 1437 passes in the coming legislative session, which begins Feb. 2.
“Physical activity is one of the most important investments we can make in our kids’ future,” Pugh said in his announcement. “Being active and healthy isn’t just about strength or endurance. It’s about building a foundation for better mental health, stronger academic performance and long-term wellbeing.”
Sen. Adam Pugh, R-Edmond, speaks at a Senate Education Committee meeting May 20 at the state Capitol in Oklahoma City. (Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)
Trump’s July 31 executive order reestablished the test and reconvened the President’s Council on Sports, Fitness and Nutrition, which will issue recommendations for the test’s administration.
President Dwight D. Eisenhower established the first iteration of a national youth fitness test in 1956 with an emphasis on military readiness. 
President Barack Obama replaced the test in 2012 with the Presidential Youth Fitness Program, which promoted living a physically active and healthy lifestyle rather than measuring athletic performance.
Pugh’s bill would direct the Oklahoma State Department of Education to create guidelines for administering the Presidential Fitness Test. Those guidelines would have to be based on recommendations from the President’s Council on Sports, Fitness and Nutrition. The guidance must include training for personnel to administer the test.
Students’ fitness results shouldn’t impact their grade point average, Pugh told Oklahoma Voice.
Rather, school districts should use the test results to promote the physical and mental benefits of daily movement, exercise and good nutrition; modify activity opportunities offered to students; and encourage participating in physical activities inside and outside the school setting, according to the bill’s text.
“This legislation encourages healthy habits early in life and supports a culture of fitness that benefits students for a lifetime,” Pugh said when announcing the bill. “These are foundational habits that support overall health and that should always be our goal.”
Families would have the option to opt out their children from taking the fitness test, according to the bill. Further exemption guidelines would apply to students with disabilities, medical conditions or other factors impacting their ability to complete the test.
The Oklahoma Rural Health Transformation Program, a $233 million federally funded initiative, will provide $4 million to rural schools for exercise equipment, a cardio and walking-focused app for students, and professional development for physical education teachers — all with the goal of implementing the Presidential Fitness Test. 
The Rural Health Transformation Program provides federal dollars intended to offset Medicaid cuts that were included in the “big, beautiful” budget policy that Trump signed into law in July.

Participating in Dry January, which originally started as a 2013 United Kingdom public health campaign, can provide immediate benefits including better skin quality, possible weight loss and more time and money for other hobbies, said Katie Witkiewitz, the director for Center on Alcohol, Substance use, And Addictions at the University of New Mexico.
“A lot of people are setting New Year’s resolutions to eat better, get more active, and so why not add cutting out drinking to the list of things that we’re trying to change in the month of January,” she told Source NM in a phone interview.
New Mexico ranks first in the nation for alcohol mortality, and had 1,756 alcohol-related deaths in 2024, the latest data available from the health department. Additionally, alcohol accounted for 9% of all hospitalizations statewide during the same time period, according to a news release from the New Mexico Department of Health.
One in three deaths in New Mexicans aged 20 to 39-years old is linked to alcohol, said Witkiewitz, which is higher than the national average of about one in five deaths.
“It’s definitely a priority for New Mexicans to be thinking about reducing their drinking, changing their relationship with alcohol, or even abstaining altogether,” she said.
But participating in Dry January doesn’t have to mean abstention.
“You don’t have to go Dry January completely — Drier January, and Damp January are also options,” she said. “Just taking the month to choose to drink less might be associated with considerable health benefits.”
Witkiewitz also noted the availability of no or low-alcohol drink substitutes.
“I have been seeing more options in New Mexico, which is great, but we really need more available so that we can continue to have those social benefits of drinking without the alcohol,” she said.
For people who are regular, heavy drinkers, Witkiewitz encouraged consultation with a doctor, as stopping suddenly may be dangerous.
“If you’re someone who’s experiencing or has experienced seizures, hallucinations, severe sweating or vomiting when you’re not drinking — that could be signs that you’re at risk for a severe withdrawal reaction to not drinking,” she said. “I always recommend people consult with a medical provider, you know, before engaging in Dry January in those cases.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-07 20:02:02+00:00,CT Mirror,CT joins 22 other states sued by U.S. over voter registration data,Andrew Brown,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/07/ct-voter-registration-social-security-justice-lawsuit/,President Donald Trump's administration wants CT officials to turn over voter data including driver's license and Social Security numbers.,"President Donald Trump’s administration has filed a lawsuit in federal court attempting to force Connecticut election officials to turn over all of the state’s voter registration data. 
Attorneys with the U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division in Washington, D.C., filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Connecticut on Tuesday after Stephanie Thomas, Connecticut’s Secretary of the State, refused to provide that office with all of the voter registration information that was requested.
In Connecticut, portions of the state’s voter registration database are publicly available to anyone who requests the information and pays a $300 fee. 
But Thomas, who has served as Connecticut’s Secretary of the State since 2023, has refused to give the DOJ another version of that data, which includes voters’ Social Security numbers and driver’s license numbers.
In letters that were shared back and forth between August and December of last year with the Justice Department, Thomas argued that Connecticut law prohibits her office from sharing the Social Security and driver’s license numbers included in the voter registration data with anyone.
In its complaint in federal court, however, the DOJ attorneys disagreed and argued that federal law — specifically the Civil Rights Act — requires the state to turn over that information.
“Secretary Thomas’ refusal to produce the records demanded constitutes a failure tocomply with federal law,” the DOJ wrote in the complaint. 
Connecticut is not the first state to be sued by the Trump administration for declining to turn over voter registration information. In total, the Trump administration has filed lawsuits against 23 states and the District of Columbia over similar denials. 
Those lawsuits are part of a larger shift within the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division, which has sought to investigate claims of voter fraud and recently advanced complaints from right-wing groups that have repeatedly pushed unsubstantiated allegations of widespread voter fraud.
“I am not surprised that Connecticut has been added to the long list ofstates being sued on these grounds,” Thomas said in a statement on Tuesday. “As Secretary of the State, my foremost responsibility is to the voters of Connecticut who entrust the state and their local election officials with sensitive data so they can participate in our representative democracy without fear that their information will be misused or exposed.” 
Connecticut Attorney General William Tong also said in a statement that the state sought to comply with the DOJ’s requests while adhering to state law.
“We tried to work cooperatively with the DOJ to understand the basis fortheir request for our voters’ sensitive personal information,” Tong said. “Rather thancommunicating productively with us, they rushed to sue. The state ofConnecticut complies with federal law and takes its obligations underfederal laws very seriously, and we will vigorously defend the state againstthis deeply disappointing lawsuit.”
Thomas’ refusal to voluntarily turn over the Social Security numbers and driver’s license numbers for every registered voter in the state was roundly criticized by state Republican officials on Wednesday.
In a joint statement, House Minority Leader Vincent Candelora, R-North Branford, and Rep. Gale Mastrofrancesco, R-Wolcott, called the arguments that Thomas and Tong were making were “laughable.” 
“The resistance of Secretary Thomas and Attorney General Tong to federal voter integrity efforts should concern every Connecticut resident — especially given a system that allowed deep election corruption to thrive in Bridgeport,” the Republicans wrote. “If a Democratic administration had made this request, the data would have been on a FedEx truck within the hour.
“Secretary Thomas and Attorney General Tong slice and dice voter data for their own campaigns, so their attempt to position themselves as protectors of ‘sensitive’ information is laughable. They should comply with this request for public information, not obstruct it. Otherwise, residents will rightly wonder what their party has to hide,” they added. 
Meanwhile, Senate President Martin Looney, D-New Haven, and Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff, D-Norwalk, responded to the lawsuit by criticizing Trump and the unfounded claims that Trump won the 2020 election. 
“Once again, the Trump administration is using threats and coercion to try to collect Connecticut voters’ private data that it has no legal basis for requesting, and which we can only surmise has no beneficial motive for using,” they wrote. “Connecticut is one of nearly 20 Democratic states that Trump’s Justice Department is now bullying in order to create a national citizen database. Connecticut will fight for our citizens’ right to privacy, and we will not surrender to the countless election deniers and conspiracy theorists who inhabit the Trump administration.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_5845-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-07 15:12:24.464662

Hoeme has set up a permanent conservation easement area on his land. (Submitted)TOPEKA — An organization dedicated to preserving the endangered lesser prairie chicken and other grouse species is changing tactics to work with farmers and ranchers on grassland preservation and needed policy changes. 
Ted Koch, executive director of the North American Grouse Partnership, is a retired biologist whose second career led him to the partnership. Once there, he realized that making moves to protect the prairie grassland ecosystem would have a cascading effect to support farmers and ranchers, as well as grouse populations. 
He recently visited state and national legislators to share about the challenges of protecting grasslands through increasing compensation for ranchers who put environmental conservation practices in place. 
It’s a different message for his organization, which has been focused solely on protecting 12 grouse species, including the lesser prairie chicken. It has been listed as endangered twice in the past 10 years, Koch said. 
As he talked to state agencies and others about grouse, someone pointed out that most of the prairie chicken habitat was on private land. Koch reached out to 10 ranchers for a call. 
“I said I want to save chickens and ranching,” Koch said. “And all the ranchers said, ‘Sorry, Ted, we’re not interested. We want to save ranching.’ Direct. Clear cut.”
The Grouse Partnership learned that if it wanted to save grouse, the group needed to expand  programs supporting ranchers who want to initiate conservation practices but can’t afford to, he said. 
Rancher and farmer Stacy Hoeme practices conservation on his farm’s acreage in Gove County and along the Smoky Hill River. He and his son have used  limited tillage and crop rotation, and through a research project they became interested in prairie chicken populations. 
Hoeme also committed to a permanent conservation easement, an option as part of the farm bill. 
He, like many farmers and ranchers, understands the benefits of taking care of the land and the grassland ecosystem.
“You need to have sustainable grasslands to have good water, which our water situation out here is critical,” Hoeme said. “(Grassland) helps put water back in the aquifer by slowing it down.”
Although he’s committed acres to long-term conservation projects, Hoeme knows that it’s not practical for many people to put land in the Conservation Reserve Program, or CRP. 
He’s watching as many farmers and ranchers take land out of the CRP. 
“The value of CRP grass is half of what it is if it’s ag ground,” he said. 
Koch has been talking to legislators to explain the challenge and highlight the interconnected ecosystem. Saving ranching and the grasslands are intertwined, and policy changes need to be made, he said. 
The Grouse Partnership formed the Lesser Prairie-Chicken Landowner Alliance to create a workable plan with the mission to “save ranching, rural communities, water, and wildlife,” all in cooperation with ranchers.  
“Why are these conservative western Kansas ranchers willing to partner with a retired federal endangered species biologist to save the most threatened ecosystem?” Koch asked. “It’s wildly unacceptable to them that we’re losing 2 million acres of grasslands every year, and that there’s fewer livestock producers and lower cattle herds. That’s where we come together.”
The alliance wants to create ranching strongholds in the southwestern Great Plains, Koch said. That includes establishing 10 200,000-acre ranching areas that will be the “last best places of grasslands for rangeland cattle production, wildlife populations, aquifer protection, and sustained rural communities,” according to the  organization’s explainer. 
That work has been going on over the past five years using market-based models, where ranchers are paid fair market value for conservation services. They’d like to see those types of programs expanded, Koch said, so farmers are able to make finances work. 
“If we have to reduce our herds by 10 or 20%, we need to get paid for that,” Koch said. “My analogy there is it’s completely unreasonable for Americans to go to these ranchers and say, ‘We want you to recover this endangered species and we’ll give you 60% of the cost and take the other 40% out of your pot.’ Wildly unreasonable.”
It’s important to understand that ranchers want to be paid for producing conservation outcomes on their land, he added. They don’t want subsidies, cost shares or incentives. 
Much work remains to be done to create a system that supports preserving the grasslands — and of course, prairie chickens — and supports farmers and ranchers, Koch said. 
“They want to engage in the business negotiations just like anyone else,” he said, pointing out that when the federal government buys products from Ford Motor Co., it doesn’t tell the company how to make trucks.
“Let’s treat ranchers like they’re business professionals that they are, and contract with them to produce meaningful, measurable conservation outcomes on their working range lines while they continue to raise and sell beef and feed America,” Koch said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Stacey-Hoeme-with-prairie-ckn-IMG_6411-1024x796.jpeg,,,2026-01-07 15:12:24.464662

Josh Stein's State of the State address on March 12, 2025. (Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)The NC Court of Appeals has ruled in favor of the General Assembly over Governor Josh Stein in a challenge involving judicial appointments and a restructuring of the state’s Utilities Commission.
Senate Bill 382 was passed at the end of the 2024 session, with the Republican majority overriding then-Governor Roy Cooper’s veto.
GOP leaders called  SB 382 as a “good government” measure and said that transferring the governor’s appointments to other members of the executive branch – all Republicans, notably – maintains the constitutionally required separation of powers.
The Stein administration filed several legal challenges to the law, arguing that the governor should control the majority of appointments to regulatory bodies that carry out the executive branch function of enforcing state law. Stein said the legislation amounted to “partisan power grabs [to] thwart North Carolina voters’ decisions at the ballot box.”
On Wednesday, the court ruled that the General Assembly did not violate the separation of powers clause by restructuring the Utilities Commission and giving Republican state Treasurer Brad Briner, rather than the Democratic governor, the power to appoint members to the commission. Briner used that authority last year to name Donald van der Vaart, a former state Department of Environmental Quality Secretary and a climate skeptic, to the commission.
“The General Assembly can appoint and confirm statutory officers,” wrote Judge John Tyson. “The order of the three-judge superior court panel upholding the State Treasurer’s appointment to the Utilities Commission is affirmed.”
In a 2-1 split decision, the appellate court also ruled that the legislature did not violate the separation of powers clause by requiring the governor to appoint appellate judges “from a list of three qualified persons recommended by the political party executive committee of the political party with which the vacating judge was affiliated when elected.”
Attorneys for Stein had argued in a February 2025 filing that “absent a constitutional amendment approved by the people, the constitution leaves no room for the legislature to place restrictions, qualifications or limitations on the governor’s power to fill judicial appellate court vacancies.”
Judge Allegra Collins dissented from the majority opinion in addressing the Utilities Commission appointments and appellate judicial vacancies.
Collins reasoned SB 382 unfairly tips the scales to provide ‘legislative dominance.’
“The General Assembly’s asserted authority to reassign appointments among Council of State members at any time, including immediately after an election, for any reason, or no reason at all, gives the General Assembly the power to determine which executive official controls the swing vote on the Commission, including the swing vote on the selection of the chair,” Collins wrote. “This creates the separation?of?powers danger…legislative dominance over the execution of the laws.”
Last April, the North Carolina Court of Appeals upheld yet another controversial provision in SB 382, which transferred authority over the state’s Board of Elections to the state auditor’s office.
On Wednesday, Senate President Phil Berger celebrated the latest ruling on social media.
“Another victory secured! Despite Gov. Stein’s efforts to weaponize the courts to usurp the General Assembly’s authority, this ruling recognizes reality and proper constitutional order. In North Carolina, the governor is not a king,” Berger posted.
Stein’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Phil Murphy signed into law Wednesday.
“My Administration has made it a priority to pursue lasting change through whole-of-government action, and today’s bill signing builds on our work to make New Jersey the best state in the nation to deliver and raise a baby,” Murphy said in a statement.
New federal law complicates state health care affordability efforts

The four new laws require:

Non-volunteer fire departments to adopt and annually review policies addressing job-related issues of pregnant employees, including limitations of duties and the use of leave time for pregnancy.
Health care professionals to conduct lead screenings on certain pregnant women, based on federal guidelines and expert recommendations.
An extension in the time parents have to enroll newborns in health benefits coverage from 60 days to 90 days.
The state Maternal and Infant Health Innovation Authority to launch a public awareness campaign on the benefits of doula and midwife services.

First lady Tammy Murphy, whose Nurture NJ initiative aims to improve outcomes for moms and babies, said the new laws will ensure “all moms and babies in New Jersey have the opportunity to thrive.” She has advocated for reducing racial disparities in mortality and urged state lawmakers and health officials to improve access to safe care for new parents.
Fire departments will have 180 days to adopt new policies, insurance extensions will take effect in March, and prenatal lead screening expansions will go into effect on April 1.
The statewide campaign on doula and midwife services will include descriptions of services provided by doulas and midwives during prenatal, birthing, and postpartum periods. It will also delve into culturally competent care, health benefits, and improved outcomes as a result of doula and midwife services, and free or low-cost resources for those services.
New Jersey is ranked 25th across the country for maternal mortality rates, according to the United Health Foundation.

South Carolina’s motto, as always, hurls us headlong with joy and optimism into the New Year.
My hope for 2026 is that state leaders address our state’s real problems this year and nudge us further toward a modern and prosperous state that works for everyone.
My hope is that state leaders grapple with the cost-of-living challenges we face, fix the rotten roads and bridges, close the teacher-shortage gap, expand health care coverage, tackle rising insurance rates, promote vaccination, avoid nuttiness (banning “chemtrails,” really?), and extend a more generous hand to our most vulnerable citizens.
And here’s another idea fit for the New Year: It’s time for us to remove the dusty statues of John C. Calhoun and Wade Hampton III from the U.S. Capitol.
Every state in the nation contributes two statues to the National Statuary Hall Collection to reflect the finest values of the people of our states.
Our two statues, Calhoun and Hampton, represent South Carolina to all Capitol visitors. They represent our state to the world. But these are two of the worst people represented by statues in the U.S. Capitol.
The stony visage of Calhoun, the fierce advocate of slavery, has scowled over the halls of the Capitol building since 1910. The statue is currently located with others in the Capitol Crypt, suitable for a dead philosophy.
Hampton, the white supremacist and slaveholder, has resided with mutton-chopped extravagance in the U.S. Capitol since 1929.
They’ve dwelled in the Capitol at public expense for too long. Time for a respectful eviction.
What brings this to mind is a recent inspiring story out of Virginia, which removed its Robert E. Lee statue from the U.S. Capitol in 2020. Just last month, Lee was replaced with a statue of teenage civil rights activist Barbara Rose Johns.
The gutsy Johns famously led a 1951 student strike against school segregation, which contributed to the Brown v. Board of Education decision. Johns now stands with George Washington in the Capitol.
The statue of Lee, commander of the Confederate States Army, was moved to a Virginia museum.
The symbolism couldn’t be clearer: Virginia chose a message of aspiration and racial equality over honoring the racial strife and bloodshed of the past. The Old Dominion embraced the New South.
For South Carolinians concerned about local Confederate statues, it’s worthwhile to note that Virginia in removing Lee from the Capitol has not removed statues of Lee from across Virginia.
The Calhoun and Hampton statues also belong in museums to place them in a balanced historical context.
Statues in public places are not neutral historical records. They’re public endorsements. They represent our shared values, those we hold dear, not those we find morally abhorrent.
Calhoun and Hampton are worthy of devoted study but not worthy of public veneration.
Better angels
If Virginians can find the courage to express the better angels of their nature, South Carolinians can, too.
This idea is not too far-fetched: In 2020, Charleston City Council took the bold step of removing a statue of Calhoun from Charleston’s Marion Square.
Calhoun, who died in 1850, was perhaps the most prominent and strident defender of slavery and white supremacy in American history.
Unlike some of the founders of our nation who called slavery a “necessary evil,” Calhoun argued in an 1837 Senate speech that slavery was a “positive good” — that it was beneficial, morally justified, and the proper foundation of a stable society. He also insisted that racial hierarchy was natural and desirable.
These ideas today are loathsome to South Carolinians.
Calhoun, a powerful orator, was not just a slaveholder. He was, in many respects, the chief theorist of slaveholding and an architect of the nation’s slide toward Civil War.
Hampton, for his part, was a Confederate lieutenant general and one of the most prominent slaveholders in the Southeast.
His successful 1876 campaign for governor coincided with widespread intimidation and violence against Black voters, most notably by the Red Shirts, a paramilitary group that supported Hampton.
Historians connect the Red Shirts to the Hamburg Massacre and Ellenton Riot. Estimates of the resulting deaths range from 30 to more than 100 Black South Carolinians.
As governor (1876–1879), Hampton rolled back Reconstruction gains and paved the way for Jim Crow laws, excluding Black South Carolinians from meaningful power for generations.
But who could replace these two old Democrats, Calhoun and Hampton, in the U.S. Capitol?
That question will offer a lively future discussion among South Carolinians.
A few names I’d suggest: Robert Smalls, Ronald McNair, Ernest “Fritz” Hollings, Charles H. Townes, John Laurens and Septima Clark.
Redeeming qualities
Supporters of the status quo point out that Calhoun and Hampton, despite the gravity of their moral failings, possessed redeeming qualities.
Historians such as Merrill D. Peterson and H.W. Brands give Calhoun credit for being a brilliant if flawed thinker for developing such concepts as nullification and expressing concerns about the tyranny of the majority.
Calhoun served for decades — as congressman, senator, secretary of war, secretary of state, and vice president — and was widely regarded in his time.
Hampton, for his part, was revered by past generations of South Carolinians for his bravery, personal honor and humane treatment of civilians during the Civil War.
That said, the two were fiercely and irredeemably on the wrong side of history, defending the greatest injustices our nation has ever known. Weighed in the balance, they’re found wanting.
Calhoun and Hampton do not represent a modern, economically vibrant and increasingly diverse South Carolina that’s striving toward greater unity and harmony.
Isn’t it time we present the best version of our great state to the world?",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/John-c-Calhoun-scaled-e1767815752728-1024x570.jpg,,,2026-01-07 14:59:07.589270

The news comes as local officials, the police department and activists in Mississippi’s largest metro area are celebrating a decline in homicides reaching pre-pandemic levels, according to multiple news outlets that track crime statistics. 
The candidates are vying to replace Joseph Wade, who retired last year after serving as chief since 2023. Mayor John Horhn named Tyree Jones, the Hinds County sheriff, to serve as interim chief. 
The city’s press release states the interviews will build on public listening sessions held over the last year by a law enforcement task force that Horhn convened. During those sessions, several Jacksonians and some police officers stated their desire to see Horhn elevate a homegrown officer currently serving in the department.
The four finalists, winnowed from a pool of 32 applicants, include just one person who fits that profile: Wendell Watts, who is currently serving as the assistant chief of patrol operations. In that role, Watts oversees criminal investigations, the department’s Crime Gun Intelligence Center and multiple interagency task forces, according to the city’s press release. 
Watts began his career at JPD in the early 1990s and returned to the department in 2023 after serving as the inaugural police chief for the city of Gluckstadt, a growing suburb north of Jackson. 
But Watts is not the only finalist with Mississippi experience. The current police chief of Columbus, Joseph Daughtry, is also a finalist for the role. The city of Jackson’s press release states that under Daughtry’s leadership, the northeastern city “experienced a full calendar year without a homicide,” an achievement that “had not occurred in more than two decades.” 
Before taking the Columbus role in 2022, Daughtry served as the Natchez police chief. 
Coming from further south, LeJon Roberts, a police major with the New Orleans Police Department, is also being considered. Roberts leads NOPD’s field operations bureau that oversees several of the city’s “most violent police districts,” according to the release. He was also tasked with “ensuring full compliance” with the city’s longrunning federal consent decree. 
“His portfolio includes command oversight of specialized units such as tactical platoons, K-9, explosives ordnance disposal, marine and search-and-rescue operations, traffic fatality investigations, and violent offender apprehension teams,” the city’s release states. 
The only woman among the finalists, RaShall Brackney served as the chief of police for Charlottesville, Va., and George Washington University in Washington, D.C., according to the city’s press release. She also spent three decades with the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police.
Brackney is currently a professor at George Mason University where the city’s release states her work focuses on “procedural justice, harm reduction, restorative justice, and collaborative approaches to strengthening police-community relations.” 
She is married to a Tougaloo College graduate and her in-laws live in Madison. 
Horhn and the law enforcement task force are set to interview the candidates on Thursday. City spokesperson Nic Lott said he doesn’t yet know how soon the mayor will name a new chief after the interviews.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/26160332/Chief-Joe-Wade-retires-2.jpg,,,2026-01-07 14:59:07.589270

(William Woody for Colorado Newsline)Our nation has reached a critical inflection point. We can no longer ignore the alarming reality that we are using more water than the Colorado River reliably provides. Major reservoirs such as Lake Mead and Lake Powell sit at roughly one-third full and under historic stress.
Operating guidelines that manage the delivery of the River’s water — and therefore, the stability of its $3.8 trillion economy – are expiring. As our nation endures extreme levels of hydrology, droughts, and aridity — far worse than the River’s current operational framework predicted – the need for long-term solutions to this crisis has never been more urgent.
As business leaders from Arizona and Colorado, we represent hundreds of companies and thousands of jobs that rely on a stable and well-managed Colorado River. We recognize the monumental challenge of updating the rules that govern how this water is allocated and delivered to farms, businesses, and communities across seven states and Mexico.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
From a business perspective, the implications couldn’t be more acute. Water supply uncertainty threatens agriculture, manufacturing, power generation, municipal planning, and recreation economies. Investors require reliable resource baselines to commit, expand and add jobs. When the risk of systemic failure hovers, projects get deferred, jobs aren’t created, and economies falter.
We believe this is the moment to lead with innovation, collaboration and best-in-class planning to guide long-term and sustainable management of the Colorado River. Cooperation and long-term planning provide the certainty businesses depend on and lead to decisions that sustain investment and economic development for rural and urban communities alike.
The next set of guidelines will direct operations for the Colorado River after 2026. Reaching agreement on these guidelines isn’t some arcane bureaucratic exercise; it will set the foundation for sustained economic development and prosperity for millions of people, tens of thousands of businesses, and countless jobs. Our region’s economic future relies on a cooperatively managed river system that can effectively and reliably support communities and industry for decades to come.
When states and Tribal nations collaborate on long term-river management, they send a clear signal to investors and employers: the Basin’s water supplies are managed cooperatively, given its unstable hydrologic future, providing more predictability. That message matters. It matters for mountain communities and desert cities, for farmers and factories, and for recreation economies and high-tech hubs.
We’re grateful for the efforts of our state and Tribal leaders as they work toward durable solutions, and we see this moment in the river’s history as pivotal to our collective ability to prosper.
Let’s commit to a shared, pragmatic, forward-looking framework. We are all in this together.

MONTPELIER — In his annual address to Vermont legislators Wednesday afternoon, Gov. Phil Scott urged the House and Senate to move forward with the sweeping education reform project lawmakers started last year at his administration’s urging.
But as the 2026 legislative session got underway this week, it has seemed far from certain that lawmakers will be able to overcome some key hurdles to make Scott’s plans a reality.
Speaking to a joint assembly of legislators for his State of the State address, Scott called education reform “our most critical challenge.” 
“This session, we have the opportunity and the obligation to continue this transformation in order to build the best public education system in the nation — at a cost taxpayers can afford,” he said.
The governor’s speech, which ran for about half an hour, was notable in that it focused nearly entirely on the goals of the administration’s education reform plans, centered around the 2025 law known as Act 73. Scott framed the need to evolve the state’s education system as important for preserving the public’s trust in state government.
“We don’t need to be asked to do the right thing,” he said. “We just need to do it.”
Scott also used his speech to preview, albeit briefly, that there would be “hard choices” to make when building the state’s new budget for the 2027 fiscal year, which starts in July 2026 and runs through June 2027. Lawmakers have already been expecting that some existing programs will need to be cut as support from the federal government continues to be uncertain.
“This year’s spending package has required difficult decisions,” he said of his administration’s budget proposal, which he will present in another address later this month.
This story will be updated.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Legislation that would require new Florida voters to show proof of U.S. citizenship has again been filed in advance of the Florida legislative session kicking off next week in Tallahassee.
HB 991 reportedly has the backing of the Florida supervisors of election and is sponsored by state Reps. Jenna Persons-Mulicka, R-Fort Myers, and Dana Trabulsy, R- Fort Pierce.
The bill is similar to Persons-Mulicka’s legislation from a year ago, which came in response to President Trump’s 2025 executive order requiring voters to show proof of U.S. citizenship. That bill died in committee.
The 2026 bill from Persons-Mulicka and Trabulsky include these provisions:

Requires documentary proof of citizenship to register to vote.
Mandates that the Florida Department of State review all current voter registrations for citizenship status and forward names to supervisors of elections to request proof of eligibility from voters. It lists documents voters can provide as proof, including a current and valid U.S. passport; a U.S. birth certificate; a Consular Report of Birth Abroad provided by the U.S. State Department; a current and valid Florida driver license or ID card issued by the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles (DHSMV); a naturalization certificate, a certificate of citizenship, a certificate number, or an alien registration number issued by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security; a current and valid photo ID issued by the federal government or the government of Florida which indicates U.S. citizenship; an order from a federal court granting U.S. citizenship.
Requires driver’s licenses and state ID cards to display citizenship status.
Expands information-sharing on citizenship status between the Department of State, the DHSMV and jury coordinators.
Creates a new post-election audit process.
Makes changes to the recount process.
Makes new restrictions on campaign contributions from foreign nationals.

Another measure requiring U.S. citizenship to vote that has been introduced in the House is HB 985 by Rep. Berny Jacques, R-Pinellas County. His measure is being embraced by voter integrity advocates in Florida. Among its provisions include:

Require supervisors to verify a citizenship’s status by using the Systemic Alien Verification for Entitlements Program or “SAVE” program that is administered by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services used by federal, state, and local government agencies to verify the immigration status and U.S. citizenship of applicants seeking benefits or licenses.
Election supervisors “who have determined that false affirmations have been made on a voter registration application” must refer the application to the Office of Election Crimes and Security.
Information received by the DHSMV indicating that a registered voter has received a driver’s license in another state “shall be considered a written request from the voter to have his or her name removed from the statewide voter registration system.”
Narrows the list of IDs that can be used at the polls.
Adds new requirements for voters who registered using a Florida ID.
Expands the use of provisional ballots for voters whose citizenship can’t be verified.
Creates additional steps for vote-by-mail requests.
Florida IDs and driver licenses issued to non-citizens must be marked “NC” on the front.

“The future of our state and nation depends on free and secure elections!” Jacques wrote in a newsletter sent to his constituents this week. “I urge my colleagues to stand with me to safeguard our elections and support this critical piece of legislation. Thank you for your support — together, we will ensure that Florida’s elections are secure for the foreseeable future.”
Neither bill requiring U.S. citizenship to vote has a Senate companion yet.
Only four states — Arizona, Louisiana, Wyoming, and New Hampshire — require that voters provide a document proving their U.S. citizenship to register to vote,  according to VoteRiders, a nonpartisan organization.
Other election bills filed for session
Other election-related bills this year include a measure to revise the timelines for when special elections can take place. That measure has been filed in the Senate by Boca Raton Democrat Tina Polsky and in the House (HB 597) by Democrats Mike Gottlieb of Davie and Daryl Campbell of Fort Lauderdale.
Polsky is also the Senate sponsor of a proposal (SB 132) to establish a centralized database to track the voting rights of individuals with felony convictions. Rep. Felicia Robinson, D-Miami Gardens, is the main sponsor of the bill (HB 73) in the House.
Another measure would limit foreign influence in state elections, government, and public institutions. The proposal, called “The Foreign Interference Restriction and Enforcement Act” (SB 1178), is sponsored by Sen. Erin Grall, R-Vero Beach.
The proposal requires agents of foreign countries of concern (defined as China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, Cuba, Qatar, Syria, and “the Venezuelan regime of Nicolás Maduro”) to register with the Division of Elections and file regular disclosures. It would prohibit public officials, employees, and candidates from accepting gifts, travel, or anything of value from foreign countries of concern or designated terrorist organizations.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_2506-1024x834.jpg,,,2026-01-07 14:59:07.589270

(Photo courtesy of Amanda McKinney Campaign)Two years ago, Amanda McKinney, a Republican Yakima County commissioner, made a commercial endorsing Republican U.S. Rep. Dan Newhouse for re-election and assailing his GOP opponent who had the backing of then former President Donald Trump.
“I trust Dan,” she says in the 30-second television spot, adding that he has the “experience and clout to keep delivering for central Washington.”
Two weeks ago, McKinney, who is running to succeed the outgoing Newhouse, offered a different story at AmericaFest, an annual event hosted by Turning Point USA, the conservative organization founded by the late Charlie Kirk.
She told the crowd that after “her congressman” voted to impeach Trump in 2021, “I knew that I needed to find a way to retire him. I took a couple years … understanding and finding a pathway to retire our sitting congressman.”
Video from her Dec. 21 appearance in Phoenix, Arizona, has been mashed together with snippets from the campaign ad into a meme that’s captured the attention of Republicans in the 4th Congressional District that Newhouse has represented since 2015.
“I’ve had a lot of Republicans ask me about it,” said Matt Brown, chair of the Yakima County Republican Party and political director for the state Republican Party. “They say it doesn’t make a lot of sense. She’s been in videos with Dan for years.”
Republican Jerrod Sessler, who lost to Newhouse in 2024 and was the target of the campaign ad McKinney appeared in, was more blunt.
Jerrod Sessler is running as a Republican for a U.S. House seat in Washington’s 4th Congressional District.
“She lied. No soft shoeing it,” texted Sessler, who is also running for the congressional seat. “She lied about working to retire him because, since the impeachment, she’s been actively working to support him.”
McKinney did not respond to requests for comment.
Her ardent and longstanding support for Newhouse didn’t dissuade Trump from endorsing McKinney on Tuesday. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana, did so too.
Trump is no fan of Newhouse. He ridiculed him as “weak and pathetic” during the 2024 election because of the impeachment vote.
The endorsements for McKinney seem aimed at nullifying Sessler, who is making his third run at the seat, and averting a slugfest among GOP candidates in the solidly Republican district. McKinney and Sessler are the only ones to announce, but state Sen. Matt Boehnke, R-Kennewick, is eyeing the race and could join in the coming days.
Sessler, of Prosser, a Navy veteran and businessman, said Tuesday that he continues to have Trump’s support.
“I knew the deal was inbound. There is no tarnish on the relationship between the president and I,” Sessler said. “His team is making deals as they have done in the past. My endorsement is from the president himself.”
One Democrat is mounting a bid for the 4th District seat so far: John Duresky, a retired Air Force officer who also worked at the Hanford nuclear cleanup site. And Devin Poore has launched a campaign as an independent. 
When Newhouse announced Dec. 17 that he would not seek a seventh term, he told reporters he had made no decisions “about who I may or may not be supporting” as a successor.

Ron DeSantis, speaking at Grace Christian School in Valrico on Sept. 3, 2025. (Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Gov. Ron DeSantis issued a proclamation Wednesday calling a special session in April to redistrict Florida’s congressional map, just one month after the regular legislative session is scheduled to end.
Although the call is long-awaited, coming months after DeSantis first hinted that he wanted a spring session to redraw Florida’s political lines, GOP House Speaker Danny Perez has pushed back on the governor’s plan to wait until after the regular session. And while lawmakers must abide by a governor’s special session call, they don’t have to pass any legislation.
The special session is set for April 20-24, weeks after the 2026 regular session ends on March 13.
“We are going to do it in the later part of April, partially because there’s a Supreme Court decision that’s going to affect the validity of some of these districts nationwide, including some of the districts in the state of Florida,” DeSantis said during an unrelated press conference in Steinhatchee.
“I know there’s a lot of people that are excited in both the House and the Senate to be able to do it, so they’re gonna get their chance to do it. But, realistically, you can’t do it now — the Supreme Court hasn’t ruled,” he continued. “So, we’ve got to give some time for that.”
In addition, he floated the possibility of another special session to take on property taxes. There’s “some value” in doing a session specifically dedicated to slashing the tax on homestead properties, he said.
Waiting for SCOTUS
DeSantis referred to a highly anticipated ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court in a voting rights case out of Louisiana. The high court, expected to rule later this year, could bar states from taking the racial makeup of districts’ populations into account when drawing congressional lines.
Traditionally, states redistrict every 10 years following new U.S. Census data revealing the ebbs and flows of regional populations.
But the conversation surrounding the highly unusual potential for mid-decade redistricting reached a fever pitch when President Donald Trump, hoping to pad the GOP’s slim congressional majority, told Texas Republicans in July to redraw their maps.
A political cascade ensued. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, threatened to retaliate by creating more Democratic seats in his state. Democrats in Illinois, Virginia, and Maryland have discussed redrawing their congressional maps, as have GOP lawmakers in Nebraska, Kansas, and Florida.
But in Florida, fissures have begun to appear between Republican on redistricting. Although DeSantis, Perez, and Senate President Ben Albritton all agree on mid-decade redistricting (DeSantis believes a SCOTUS ruling in his favor would necessitate a change in South Florida districts primarily made up of Black and Hispanic voters), they don’t all agree on the timing.
DeSantis, for his part, has emphasized the need to wait until the SCOTUS ruling to redistrict. Albritton also would like to wait.
Perez wouldn’t.
In September, he created a House redistricting committee to “explore” the process and potentially expedite the procedure in the Legislature. The Senate lacks a similar committee.
“We’re not going to wait until the spring, we’re going to move forward now,” Perez told POLITICO in December, adding that it would be “irresponsible” to wait.
This isn’t the first instance of disagreement between Perez, representing Miami, and DeSantis. The entirety of the 2025 session, a marathon 45 days longer than the 60 days initially scheduled, was marked by discord between the GOP supermajority Legislature and the executive branch.
This was largely spearheaded by Perez, who repeatedly urged his members to assert their independence from the governor. This struck a vastly different chord from DeSantis’ previous years in office, when he’d enjoyed an iron grip over a compliant Legislature as he geared up for a presidential run.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/0-1-1-1024x771.jpeg,,,2026-01-07 14:59:07.589270

While Mills announced that 52 bills approved by lawmakers last legislative session that were awaiting final approval will become law, she also decided to veto a proposal that sought to clarify the recent Right to Repair referendum voters approved. 
In a veto letter, Mills said she rejected LD 1228 because she believes it harms local auto repair shops and veers too far from the intent of the law passed on the 2023 ballot.
Among the bills that became law was LD 222, which establishes a voluntary, statewide takeback program for firefighting foam laden with forever chemicals. This legislation was part of a package of three bills brought forth by Rep. Dan Ankeles (D-Brunswick) after the August 2023 spill in Brunswick.
Mills said she needs more time to consider what she will do with LD 1164, which would give the Wabanaki Nations exclusive rights to operate internet gaming in Maine. The news release from her office said the governor intends to announce her decision on that legislation in the coming days. 
The bills that were given the green light to become law were held over from the previous session, which adjourned last June. Most of the new laws will go into effect 90 days after the Legislature adjourns, which is scheduled for mid-April. Though, some were passed as emergency measures and will take effect Saturday.

The Executive Board, a group of legislative leaders that serve as the human resources arm of Nebraska’s officially nonpartisan Legislature, filed Legislative Resolution 282 on Wednesday, officially making the motion to pursue the expulsion of State Sen. Dan McKeon of Amherst.
In a sign of how seriously lawmakers are taking the matter, which involves a formal complaint about McKeon’s behavior from at least one legislative staffer, the expulsion resolution was the first measure introduced in the 2026 session.
State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, the Exec Board chair, noted he intends to push to suspend the Legislature’s rules requiring seven days of notice before a hearing is scheduled so the board can hold its hearing Jan. 12. Hansen said the plan is for lawmakers to debate the rules suspension motion Thursday.
The Exec Board recommended expelling McKeon following allegations that he had inappropriately touched a legislative staffer, allegations he denies. But the board also noted what it described as a “demonstrated pattern of behavior.”
The alleged incident with the staffer prompted the Legislature’s investigation separate from a Nebraska State Patrol criminal investigation that led to McKeon being cited for misdemeanor public indecency in September.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The criminal allegation has since been downgraded to a misdemeanor disturbing the peace charge, to which McKeon has pled not guilty after initially attempting to plead no contest but changing his mind.


How the expulsion process works
To expel a member of the Nebraska Legislature, first a senator must introduce a legislative resolution presenting the motion. That resolution is then referred to a committee for a public hearing.
Per the Legislature’s rules, there must be seven days between the notice of a public hearing and the date of the legislative hearing (In McKeon’s case, the Legislature is considering suspending this rule). It’s up to the committee to determine whether the public hearing will include only invited testimony, or open it up to public comment.
Following the hearing, the committee must vote to advance the resolution to floor debate. If the resolution advances, it can be scheduled for floor debate the next day.
An expulsion motion requires just one round of floor debate and needs 33 votes to remove a sitting senator. If successful, the motion would take effect immediately and the legislative seat would become vacant until the governor appoints a replacement.


The incident took place at an end-of-session party last spring, according to the internal investigation conducted by outside counsel Tara Paulson. The staffer claimed McKeon made a joke about going to Hawaii to “get laid” and smacked her rear end after delivering the joke, according to Paulson’s report.
McKeon disputes this version of events, and has previously claimed the incident was “exaggerated and mischaracterized.”
In Paulson’s report, she noted McKeon’s perspective of the incident is that he said he hoped while the staffer was in Hawaii she got “a Hawaiian lei.” In a letter he sent to senators Monday, McKeon claimed the staffer initially said she and her husband were thinking of vacationing in Vegas, and, not being a fan of Vegas, he suggested she go to Hawaii to “get a Hawaiian lei.”
Paulson’s report concluded that McKeon’s actions did not constitute “actionable sexual harassment,” but added she thought McKeon’s actions were inappropriate and his response to the investigation did not demonstrate remorse.
“I found the senator’s demeanor during the investigation to be puzzling,” Paulson said in her report. “During my questioning, the senator responded in a joking and noticeably lackadaisical manner, a demeanor that was also observed and commented on by all witnesses interviewed.”
Hansen declined to comment on why the Exec Board unanimously voted to recommend McKeon be expelled, but said there would be more information that he expected to come out as the process continued.
Nebraska Exec Board letter shares more about allegations against State Sen. Dan McKeon

The resolution lists several additional allegations against McKeon, including that he made “jokes involving the sexual function of a male in the presence of two female staffers,” during his first week in office, and used “unprofessional and inappropriate language to describe colleagues, as well as individuals of other races.”
“Senator Dan McKeon has brought the Legislature into disrespect and disrepute and has shaken the confidence of fellow members of the Legislature that the Senator from District 41 would be able to refrain from continued activity that is contrary to senatorial traditions of decorum,” the resolution reads.
McKeon, in a written response to the Exec Board, argues that the board’s assertions include “material inaccuracies and unsupported characterizations.” He said he has not received any “reports, findings or notice” of the other allegations mentioned, so he is unable to rebut them.
McKeon said Wednesday that he intends to let the process play out to find out where the other senators land.
“A match is incomplete until the third quarter is done,” McKeon said.

(Photo by Lynne Terry/Oregon Capital Chronicle)In May 2025, Gov. Jared Polis signed Senate Bill 71 into law, dramatically expanding Colorado’s participation in the 340B Drug Pricing Program by preventing any limitations on the number of pharmacies that can profit from the federal discount.
As a Latina health care advocate who has spent years fighting for affordable access to medications, I watched this happen with deep concern. Now, as a federal lawsuit challenging the law moves forward, Colorado patients — especially those in the state’s most vulnerable communities — are caught in the middle of a growing crisis.
Created by Congress in 1992, the 340B program requires drug manufacturers to offer significantly discounted outpatient drugs to safety-net hospitals and clinics so they can reduce prescription costs and improve services for low-income, uninsured and vulnerable populations. For communities like mine, this was supposed to be a lifeline. But more than three decades later, that promise has been broken — and the impact falls hardest on the patients who were supposed to benefit most.
Despite its good intentions, the 340B program has been turned into a source of massive, unchecked profit for large, tax-exempt hospital systems and powerful pharmacy benefit managers. This means higher costs, less transparency and limited access for Coloradans.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Since its inception, the 340B program has grown exponentially. Congressional Budget Office analysis shows that 340B spending rose from $6.6 billion in 2010 to approximately $70 billion in 2023. Over that same period, spending on brand-name drugs across the rest of the market grew 4% annually. 340B-covered entity purchases now exceed Medicaid spending on prescription drugs, which hit an estimated $51 billion in 2023.
Vertically integrated health companies, like CVS Health and other large chain pharmacy networks, are driving this furious growth. Today, more than 32,000 pharmacy locations — nearly 60% of the entire U.S. pharmacy industry — function as contract pharmacies for 340B covered entities. In Colorado, 68 hospitals and 28 federally qualified health centers participate in the program, but they contract with more than 2,500 pharmacies, including out-of-state centers.
The problem is that large hospital networks and multi-billion-dollar pharmacy chains are not passing the 340B savings directly to patients. Instead, they purchase drugs at the discounted 340B price from manufacturers and then bill patients and their insurers the full commercial price.
The New York Times reported on a woman in neighboring New Mexico whose hospital bought her cancer drugs for just $2,700 using a 340B discount, yet billed her insurer $22,700. After the insurance company paid $10,000, the patient was still charged $5,000 out-of-pocket.
A Milliman study analyzing commercial and Medicare outpatient drug spending found that 340B hospitals, on average, bill all patients nearly four times more for medicine than non-340B hospitals. The cost disparity is greater for Hispanic Medicare patients, who are billed up to five times more.
The 340B program also incentivizes hospitals to favor higher-cost drugs, as the deep discount on expensive specialty medications yields much larger profit margins than generic options. Studies confirm that 340B hospitals prescribe brand-name drugs at higher rates.
Colorado patients and employers should expect these markups, high out-of-pocket charges, and incentives for higher-cost drugs to intensify as SB-71 ensures these practices will continue and the network of profiting contract pharmacies expands.
A 2025 IQVIA study found that the 340B program caused Colorado employers to lose an estimated $152 million in rebates in 2023, equating to about $45 per beneficiary. This occurs because the program’s discounted drugs displace the rebates that commercial plans and employers typically receive, increasing overall drug spending. The same study found that SB-71 will increase costs for Colorado employers by an estimated $23 million annually due to further lost rebates.
The good news is that Congress is finally taking action. Sen. John Hickenlooper has been working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle on the Senate HELP Committee to investigate 340B abuses and advance bipartisan reforms. This critical work has raised national awareness and built momentum for meaningful change.
Federal reforms offer the best solution, but if the courts do not ensure more accountability for the 340B program, Colorado’s legislature must act. Any serious 340B reform effort should include transparency requirements, patient protections, reasonable limits on contract pharmacy arrangements, and accountability mechanisms.
Our collective health and shared future are at stake. The misapplication of this program inflicts harm on communities across Colorado and the country, with devastating and disproportionate consequences for the vulnerable populations it was meant to protect.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said he plans to file the first Iowa Farm Act, to support farmers and rural communities in the state with tax relief, expanded economic opportunities and enhanced biosecurity.  
Naig, in an interview Wednesday with Iowa Capital Dispatch, said the bill is like a federal farm bill in that it “comprehensively brings in multiple facets” of farm and rural policy into one bill. 
“I think there’s value in having something that really cuts across and brings together the diverse, different interests of agriculture,” Naig said. “What that allows us to do, too, is to then have a platform, have a vehicle that we can talk to legislators about … a nice opportunity to create a focal point for ag and ag policy during a session.”

The bill includes provisions for expanded economic opportunities for farmers, tax relief for farm families, support for beginning farmers and ranchers and strengthened biosecurity procedures. Naig said the policies in the bill were derived from conversations with different groups across Iowa about their priorities. 
Naig said while the Iowa Legislature moves a “tremendous amount” of ag-related policy each session, the bill comprises priorities from small groups like Iowa beekeepers and specialty crop farmers with the ag needs from livestock and row crop commodity groups. 
Naig has been Iowa secretary of agriculture since 2018 and is seeking reelection in 2026.
Economic opportunities
According to a news release from the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship, the bill seeks to expand economic opportunities for farmers by modernizing zoning exemptions and agritourism definitions to better support on-farm operations. Specifically, the department notes activities like value-added processing and direct-to-consumer marketing should be acceptable exemptions. The news release also said Christmas tree farms should be “explicitly” included in agritourism liability protections. 
The bill would make permanent the Choose Iowa School Purchasing Pilot Program. The pilot program helps schools to purchase locally grown and raised products, which in turn, helps farmers to have a consistent local buyer.
Specialty crop and small-sized farm operations advocated for the program to be permanently funded in the 2025 legislative session after the Trump administration ended a similar federal program. 
The measure was proposed as an amendment to the state’s budget for agriculture and natural resources, but was not accepted. The pilot program awarded 33 schools a total of $70,000 in funding in May. 
The farm act would prioritize young and beginning farmers in the state’s Choose Iowa grant programs, and “provide flexibility” to expand Choose Iowa marketing opportunities.
In addition to the Iowa Farm Act, IDALS said in a release it plans to ask for a 1.6% budget increase, about $1.3 million, to maintain “essential operations.” 
Naig said the decision to pull some of these issues out of the budget proposal and into the Iowa Farm Act gives legislators some “optionality” and puts a “focus” on the different ag policy issues the department sees.
Tax provisions 
The bill has several tax provisions, including one that expands farmer rental income tax exemptions for retired farmers to include “modern” business structures like S corporations, trusts and estates. 
It would also eliminate the grain excise tax, which is currently paid on a per-bushel basis to the local property tax system.

Naig said while the grain excise tax is technically paid by grain dealers, it “tends to get passed on to farmers in one form or another.” Eliminating the tax, he said, would help farmers and also increase government efficiency by alleviating the need for the state to collect and then redistribute the taxes to counties. 
Naig said the elimination of the credit would likely have an impact on local governments, but he said that implication would be part of broader property tax discussions planned in the Legislature. 
The legislative proposal, which is not yet filed, was supported in the news release by officials from livestock, dairy, propane and row crop commodity groups. 
Mark Mueller, president of the Iowa Corn Growers Association, said in the release that the package “addresses the real needs facing rural communities today.” 
“We are especially encouraged by the focus on modernizing regulations, delivering tax relief and growing new markets for Iowa corn and other farm products,” Mueller said. 
The farm act would also exempt sales tax on the purchase of honey bees, bringing the industry in line with tax protocols for other livestock industries. The Iowa honey industry has asked for this change for several years. 
The bill would exempt storage tanks under 91,000 gallons from property taxes. 
Naig said some provisions of the Iowa Farm Act have low or no cost to the state, but the overall price tag for the act won’t be known until the fiscal notes are released.
The farm act also has provisions around biosecurity. Naig said these were included in response to the ongoing outbreak of the highly pathogenic avian influenza, which since February 2022 has impacted more than 185 million commercial and backyard birds. 
The bill would “safeguard” producer confidentiality during foreign animal disease outbreaks in an attempt to increase early reporting. It would also authorize the state to lease space for equipment used to respond to outbreaks. 
Josh Berg, president of the Iowa Turkey Federation, applauded these sections of the proposed policy and said they are “critical” to responding to a foreign animal disease outbreaks. 
“These forward-thinking provisions will enhance Iowa’s ability to support Iowa’s family farmers during times of crisis,” Berg said.
Naig said the bill text is still being finalized, but he is “hopeful” the Iowa Farm Act will become law this legislative session. 
“We’ve been briefing and talking with (leadership) throughout the process,” Naig said. “We respect the legislative process. This is something that I can do, is to introduce a bill and introduce these concepts and then work to secure passage of that. Very hopeful that we see a large percentage of this actually make it across the finish line and signed by the governor.”

(Getty Images)Indiana could join a growing number of states scrutinizing ultra-processed foods in schools under legislation heard Wednesday that would restrict certain additives in student meals and snacks.
House Bill 1137, authored by Rep. Julie McGuire, R-Indianapolis, would apply to any public school that participates in a federally funded or assisted meal program. 
Beginning with the 2027-28 school year, those schools could no longer serve or sell foods or beverages containing certain additives during the school day, including in cafeterias and vending machines, nor allow third-party vendors to do so.
Some examples might include sugary cereals, chicken nuggets, chips and applesauce.
Schools would also be required to post their breakfast and lunch menus on their websites, along with ingredient lists for each item.
“This is a healthy school lunch bill,” McGuire told members of the House Education Committee. “What we serve kids at school isn’t just about lunch. It’s about their health, their ability to learn and the long-term future of our children.”
McGuire said she expects amendments to be finalized and considered next week, before the committee decides whether to advance the bill to the full House.
‘Low-hanging fruit’
McGuire framed the proposal as a response to what she called a growing childhood chronic disease crisis, pointing to rising rates of obesity, Type 2 diabetes and metabolic disease among children.
“Ultra-processed foods now make up a huge share of what kids eat every day, and for many students, school meals account for nearly half of their daily calories,” she said. “In fact, about 65% of food served through the school lunch program are considered ultra-processed.”

The bill’s current draft defines “ultra-processed” foods as those containing one or more of 13 listed ingredients, including potassium bromate, propylparaben, titanium dioxide, several synthetic food dyes, and preservatives such as BHT and TBHQ. 
Many of those additives, McGuire said, have been linked in research to cancer risks, endocrine disruption or effects on attention and brain development.
“These ingredients are inflammatory,” she said later in the hearing. “They are leading to chronic disease, and so this is kind of low-hanging fruit to try to get to start on it.”
McGuire told lawmakers she plans to amend the bill before a committee vote, however, to avoid putting a formal definition of “ultra-processed” food into state law. She said the change was prompted by concerns about conflicting standards if federal agencies later adopt a different definition from Indiana’s.
“We’re just going to keep a list of ingredients that are prohibited,” McGuire said, “so that way, we don’t have that conflict.”
Still, the bill includes several exceptions. 
Schools could still sell foods containing the listed ingredients as part of fundraising events, as long as sales occur at least 30 minutes after the end of the school day. McGuire said the carveout is meant to preserve concession stands at athletic events. Parents would also remain free to send such foods with their children during the school day.
“We can’t control what a parent sends in with a school lunch,” McGuire said. “That becomes parental choice.”
Mixed support in public testimony
Supporters argued that the bill takes a “measured” approach and gives schools ample time to comply. Changes would not take effect until the 2027-28 school year, allowing districts to renegotiate food service contracts and work with vendors.
“This bill provides districts the necessary time to review their contracts, work with vendors and make changes without any disruption to school meal service for students and their families,” said Cindy Long, executive director of the Indiana Association of School Principals, which supports the bill.
Long said that posting menus and ingredients online would additionally help build parent trust. 
The Indiana Small Rural Schools Association also testified in support, while urging lawmakers to consider policies that expand farm-to-school programs and local food sourcing.

Separately, Josh Trenary, with the Indiana Pork Producers Association, said his organization opposes the bill “in its current form.” He argued that focusing solely on a list of additives fails to account for why some processing occurs.
“There’s more to evaluating the value of a food product than just creating a static list of additives,” Trenary said. 
He pointed specifically to BHT, which he said is used in some pork processing to prevent fats from turning rancid. 
“If a food is nutrient dense and it’s being processed in some way to either improve safety, shelf life or nutrient availability, it shouldn’t be regulated according to this approach,” Trenary continued.
The Indiana State Poultry Association took a neutral position but echoed concerns about ensuring that high-protein foods such as eggs and turkey products are not inadvertently excluded from school menus.
McGuire maintained that alternatives to certain preservatives already exist and are being used by major retailers and restaurant chains. 
“We’re asking for producers to choose different alternatives,” she said. “This is coming down the line.”
The bill also drew questions about whether Indiana is moving faster than the federal government, which is studying ultra-processed foods and food additives.










We’re asking for producers to choose different alternatives. This is coming down the line.


– Rep. Julie McGuire, R-Indianapolis


Rep. Sheila Klinker, D-Lafayette, asked whether the state should wait for more specific federal guidance.
McGuire said the delayed implementation date in her bills allows time to adjust if federal standards change.
“If, through the course of the year, something comes out about one of these particular ingredients at the federal level, we can still address that,” she said.
Officials from the Indiana Department of Health testified in support of the bill and said the agency is continuing its own review of food dyes, additives and ultra-processed foods.
“We are supportive of the transparency language and allowing parents to know what’s in their school lunches,” said Rachel Swartwood, the department’s chief of policy for health and family services. She said the measure aligns with Gov. Mike Braun’s “Make Indiana Healthy Again” initiative.
About 90% of Indiana public schools participated in the federally-funded National School Lunch Program in fiscal year 2025, according to a legislative fiscal analysis, but any financial impact on schools would depend largely on future contract terms negotiated with food service vendors.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-07 19:00:05+00:00,CT Mirror,CT DMV commissioner calls for more reforms to towing law,Dave Altimari,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/07/connecticut-towing-dmv-proposal-update/,The recommendations would require more notifications to car owners and streamline the process for selling unclaimed vehicles in CT.,"This article was produced for ProPublica’s Local Reporting Network in partnership with The Connecticut Mirror. Sign up for Dispatches to get our stories in your inbox every week.
Despite a slew of reforms enacted last year to rein in the practices of towing companies, more needs to be done to protect consumers whose cars face removal and possible sale, the commissioner of the Connecticut Department of Motor Vehicles said Tuesday.
DMV Commissioner Tony Guerrera laid out five recommendations he plans to make for the legislature to consider during its session that begins in February. The recommendations follow a Connecticut Mirror and ProPublica investigation that exposed how state law for decades favored towing companies at the expense of low-income consumers. They also follow months of meetings with a group of industry and consumer representatives.
The recommendations would require towing companies to make more effort to notify owners that their cars have been towed and streamline the process by which the firms can sell unclaimed vehicles.
The commissioner announced his proposal at the last scheduled meeting of a working group of towing and consumer representatives. The group was created as part of a towing reform law passed last year after the news organizations showed how towing companies were seeking the DMV’s permission to sell some cars after as little as 15 days, one of the shortest time frames in the country. Many low-income residents were towed for minor violations, sometimes from their own apartment complexes, only to lose their cars when they couldn’t afford to get them back before they were sold.
If the legislature adopts the recommendations, towing companies would no longer place values on vehicles that they tow, which now determines whether a tower can start the sales process in 15 days or 45 days. Instead, all cars would be sold at a public auction after 30 days, Guerrera said.
Other recommendations include requiring towing companies to send two letters to the registered owner of the vehicle after it’s towed, one certified and one not. If the car isn’t claimed, towers would have to send a third letter to the owner after 30 days to inform them when and where the auction will be held. The towing companies would be required to either advertise the auction on their websites or publish legal advertisements in local newspapers.
The DMV would also be required to set up a portal on its website listing every towed car so that people can find out which tower has their vehicle, when it was towed and when the auction will be.
If a vehicle receives no bids and the car owner shows up, the towing company would be required to offer the car back to them at whatever their costs are before selling it for scrap.
There was little pushback from industry leaders or consumer advocates on Tuesday even though towing representatives had previously complained that the changes would add costs and consumer lawyers had objected that the recommendations didn’t go far enough to protect drivers.
The proposal also didn’t address the initial task the legislature assigned to the group: how to handle the profits from the sales of towed cars. Currently, towing companies are supposed to hold onto proceeds for a year so owners or lenders can claim them. After that, any unclaimed funds, minus towing fees, are required to be turned over to the state. But CT Mirror and ProPublica found that hasn’t happened in part because the DMV never set up a system to collect the money.
Guerrera said after the meeting that the DMV has set up a process to monitor whether towing companies are turning funds over to the state. He said they won’t know if the system is working until October because the money from sales of towed cars must be held for a year.
After Guerrera finished outlining his proposal, Eileen Colonese, secretary of the industry group Towing & Recovery Professionals of Connecticut, said Guerrera’s plan doesn’t address a key issue: The last registered owner of the vehicle is not necessarily the owner when it’s towed.
“I still believe that until the state of Connecticut comes up with a process to figure out who really owns the vehicles, all of this stuff that we’re doing is pretty much nonsensical because we’re still not notifying the current owner of the vehicle,” Colonese said.
Consumer advocate and attorney Raphael Podolsky said Guerrera’s recommendations are a “step in the right direction, but there’s still a lot of issues that need to be addressed until the system is fixed.”
Guerrera said his plan was “inspired” by the discussions during the previous four committee meetings. He said he hopes the portal on the state’s website will also help DMV personnel better track what towing companies are doing with vehicles.
Under the revised law, which went into effect on Oct. 1, towing companies must now give people warning before removing vehicles from apartment parking lots unless there’s a safety issue. They also must accept credit cards, let people retrieve their belongings and be available on weekends for people to pick up their cars. And although the sales process can begin after 15 days for vehicles worth less than $1,500, towers must wait 30 days before selling them.
Guerrera said he expects that the working group will keep meeting.“I want to have continuous meetings, whether it’s quarterly or twice a quarter, to try and narrow down any issues that come up or that need to be fixed so that we can create a system that works for everybody,” Guerrera said.

(Photo by Pam Gilpin for Rhode Island Current)Cigarette butts strewn across the sand and plastic bottles bobbing in the waves are the most obvious targets of frustration about litter on Rhode Island beaches.
But the button-sized plastic and foam pieces less visible to the casual observer might be a more serious problem. More than 14,000 of these 2.5-or-smaller centimeter pieces were collected from state shorelines as part of 2025 volunteer-led efforts through the International Coastal Cleanup, according to a new report from Save the Bay. 
Tiny trash came in second to cigarette butts, which claimed the dubious honor of no. 1 trash item among the 15,561 pounds of trash collected from September to November 2025. “Other plastic waste” was the third most prevalent, followed by food waste, bottle caps and plastic beverage bottles and cans.
Plastic pellets known as ‘nurdles’ are polluting beaches and waterways

But total cigarette butts, and most types of plastic and glass bottles and cans, decreased compared with cleanup totals in 2024. Plastic and foam pieces, on the other hand, rose in quantity — a potential explanation for why the weight of total trash collected in 2025 was less than the prior year, but the total number of items was higher.
“The data reflects what we are seeing on our shores: lots of single-use items, beverage containers, and plastic and foam pieces caused by materials breaking apart over time,” July Lewis, Save The Bay’s volunteer and internship manager, said in a statement. 
And that’s just what volunteers were able to see with their own eyes.
The tiny pieces of plastic break into smaller and smaller segments, and eventually end up ingested by marine life and people, or pile up at the bottom of Narragansett Bay. A new paper published in the September 2025 Marine Pollution Bulletin by University of Rhode Island researchers found higher concentrations of microplastics in the northern part of Narragansett Bay, correlating to more densely populated urban areas. The same study also showed marshes trapped 10 to 50 times more microplastics than seabeds.
The Save the Bay report highlights ways to “stop plastic pollution at the source,” such as picking up pet waste, bringing a trash bag to the beach and encouraging friends and family to stop littering.
Bottle bill, revisited 
Not mentioned in the six-page report, but top of mind for coastal advocates: a statewide bottle-deposit refund program to incentivize recycling of plastic and glass bottles and cans. 
“The main reason Save the Bay cares about the bottle bill is because of the data you see from our coastal cleanups,” Jed Thorp, advocacy director for Save the Bay, said in an interview Wednesday. “It’s the only real, proven, effective policy to reduce litter from bottle waste.”
Various iterations of a bottle bill have failed to advance in either chamber of the Rhode Island General assembly, despite a two-year review by an 18-member legislative panel, which was unsuccessful in finding common ground between business and environmental groups. 
On the final day of the 2025 session, lawmakers passed what some dubbed a compromise solution, calling for yet another study of the topic – this time, by a third-party consultant hired by the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management. The study is due by Dec. 1, 2026, with an interim status report expected by April 1.
Does that sink bottle bill legislation this year? Not necessarily.
Rep. Carol McEntee, the South Kingstown Democrat who has championed a bottle-deposit program for years, pledged to reintroduce her proposal in 2026, even though the state-commissioned study will not be completed before the session ends in June.
“There’s no reason the Assembly couldn’t pass a bottle bill this year, even with an implementation analysis still going on,” Thorp said. 
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi and Senate President Valarie Lawson did not immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday. Shekarchi indicated in a Boston Globe interview in December that he wanted to wait until the study was finished before considering additional legislation.
Even if that’s the case, Thorp said having a piece of legislation to point to when educating lawmakers, retailers and the wider public is important.
“We’re not going to let a whole year go by and not do any advocacy on the bottle bill,” Thorp said. “There’s still a lot of education that needs to happen.”
Bonus: robot vacuum 
Save the Bay’s trash collection report reflects cleanups conducted from September to November 2025 by 2,971 volunteers across all five counties. Data might change when the global organizer Ocean Conservancy publishes its final report this summer.
Unusual items documented in the 2025 cleanup report in Rhode Island included a robot vacuum, a bird feeder, a nitrous oxide tank and 220 individual shoes and slippers. 
The 2026 International Coastal Cleanup will take place from September to November. For more information or to sign up to volunteer, visit Save the Bay’s website.

An ICE officer shot a woman driving an SUV through her car window in south Minneapolis on Wednesday morning. The person is dead, according to a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security.
Video of the incident shared with the Reformer shows masked ICE officers approach a Honda Pilot stopped in the middle of Portland Avenue near near 34th Street. One officer tells the driver to “get out of the f*cking car” and tries to open the door. The driver then slowly backs up and appears to be leaving, when another officer fires three shots. The SUV then traveled a short distance before crashing into a parked car.
The witness who took the video, Caitlin Callenson, said she was on a walk when she saw an ICE vehicle stuck in the snow. As more ICE vehicles arrived, bystanders blew whistles in protest, and the driver of the SUV tried to block the ICE vehicles.
Callenson said she did not see ICE agents attempting to detain anyone leading up to or after the shooting.
After the shots were fired, the driver was “then was completely slumped over in the vehicle,” said Emily Heller, another witness. Federal agents wouldn’t allow a man who said he is a physician to examine the driver, Heller said. Emergency medical technicians arrived 15 minutes later, she said.
Tricia McLaughlin, assistant Secretary Dept. of Homeland Security, writing on X, gave a different version of what happened: “One of these violent rioters weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them — an act of domestic terrorism. An ICE officer, fearing for his life, the lives of his fellow law enforcement and the safety of the public, fired defensive shots.”

As some federal officers attempted to leave, protestors blocked their vehicle. The officers fired a noxious gas at close range, causing distress and vomiting for many demonstrators and journalists.
Protests are ongoing.
Protesters hurled insults at Minneapolis Police officers, who are not supposed to assist with immigration enforcement, but were on the scene Wednesday morning.
City Council members including Robin Wonsley and Jamal Osman addressed the crowd, saying the area was an active crime scene, and that MPD was present to investigate.
“We are trying to get MPD the f*ck out of here. That is the best way they can be helpful right now,” Wonsley told the demonstrators.
Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty issued a statement soon after the shooting saying she is “pushing hard for a local investigation which is the only way to ensure full transparency and review by our office.”
U.S. Rep. Betty McCollum, a St. Paul Democrat, called on Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who filmed herself observing ICE actions in Minneapolis on Tuesday, to immediately stop the ICE operation “to restore order and prevent further injuries.”

Southern California Edison recibió 1500 solicitudes para su programa de compensación por incendios de Eaton y sólo ha pagado 82 después de casi dos meses.

Tras poco más de dos meses, Southern California Edison ha logrado atraer a más de 1800 clientes a un programa de compensación destinado a resolver numerosas demandas contra la compañía por el mortal incendio de Eaton. Hasta el lunes, la compañía había presentado ofertas a 82 de los solicitantes, según informó Edison a CalMatters.
La portavoz de Edison, Kathleen Dunleavy, dijo que el ritmo del proceso de las aplicaciones está por delante de lo previsto.
Los sobrevivientes del incendio, que han estado brindando comentarios a Edison desde antes de que lanzara el programa de conciliación, aún tienen fuertes críticas al programa de indemnización de la empresa de servicios públicos, denominado ” Programa de Compensación para la Recuperación de Incendios Forestales “. Se quejan de que este programa exige a los participantes que renuncien a demandas contra la empresa y les impide solicitar más indemnizaciones por reclamaciones de salud relacionadas con incendios. Muchos afirmaron que los límites de pago del programa, que limitan la cantidad que pueden recibir los solicitantes, eran demasiado bajos y permitían a Edison pagar menos de lo que la compañía eléctrica podría adeudar si se le encontrara responsable del incendio.
El incendio de Eaton quemó 14,000 acres del condado de Los Ángeles en enero y causó la muerte de 19 personas. Si bien aún no se ha determinado la causa oficial, una teoría predominante es que el equipo de Edison provocó el incendio. El Departamento de Justicia de EE. UU. se encuentra entre quienes han culpado a la compañía eléctrica por el incendio.
El dinero del seguro y los ahorros personales se están agotando para quienes perdieron sus hogares, su sustento y a sus seres queridos en el incendio, afirman los sobrevivientes y activistas. Muchos se encuentran sin hogar o enfrentan inseguridad habitacional. Una encuestaEditSign estimó que el 80% de los residentes de Altadena seguían desplazados por el incendio en octubre. La Red de Sobrevivientes del Incendio de Eaton , una destacada organización de base, solicitó a EdisonEditSign que proporcionara hasta $200,000 por hogar desplazado, “con base en costos verificados”, para ayudar a cubrir los costos de vivienda.
 “Es responsabilidad de Edison resolver todo esto”, dijo Joy Chen, directora ejecutiva del grupo. “Es su responsabilidad”.
 Hasta noviembre, se habían pagado aproximadamente $7.6 mil millones en reclamaciones de seguros relacionadas con el incendio de Eaton, según las cifras más recientes disponibles del Departamento de Seguros de California. Aproximadamente el 90% del pago correspondió a propiedades residenciales.
 Edison ofreció un total colectivo de 34,4 millones de dólares para resolver las 82 reclamaciones, y ninguna de las ofertas fue rechazada, afirmó.
 En una entrevista con CalMatters, Pedro Pizarro, director ejecutivo de Edison International, afirmó que aproximadamente la mitad de las reclamaciones que recibieron una oferta de Edison hasta diciembre fueron por pérdidas totales, y aproximadamente la otra mitad por daños causados por humo y cenizas. Si bien no proporcionó cifras específicas, Pizarro indicó que las reclamaciones se distribuyeron según la geografía, los niveles de ingresos y el valor de las viviendas. Muchas de las reclamaciones que recibieron ofertas forman parte de la opción de vía rápida del programa.
 En una conferencia de prensa celebrada el 16 de diciembre por la red de sobrevivientes, los residentes desplazados hablaron sobre cómo la inestabilidad habitacional y la pérdida de sus hogares han afectado sus vidas. Gabriel González, propietario de una empresa de plomería, perdió su casa, su negocio y herramientas por un valor aproximado de $80,000 en el incendio. Vivió en su auto durante un largo periodo antes de recibir una pequeña ayuda financiera que le permitió vivir en un lugar de alquiler durante unos meses. Pero se espera que ese dinero se agote este mes.
 “A partir del primero de enero probablemente volveré a estar en mi auto”, dijo en el evento.
 Pizarro informó a CalMatters que Edison no proporcionará fondos a los residentes para vivienda fuera de su programa de compensación, alegando la necesidad de validar los gastos. La solicitud de la red de sobrevivientes para asistencia con los costos de vivienda se limitó a los costos verificables.
 Una crítica al programa fue que los niños no reciben la misma compensación que los adultos. Bajo la versión actual del programa, los niños reciben entre el 50% y el 65% de la compensación que reciben los adultos por la pérdida de su residencia, dependiendo de la categoría del daño. Si su vivienda principal fuera destruida, los adultos recibirían $115,000 y los niños $75,000. Estas tarifas son ligeramente superiores a las de una versión preliminar del plan que Edison publicó en otoño.
 Una carta abierta de la Red de Sobrevivientes del Incendio de Eaton en ese momento decía que dar a los niños una valoración inferior a la de los adultos “trata su sufrimiento como menor cuando, en realidad, es mayor”.
 Pizarro dijo que Edison optó por una valoración más baja porque los niños a menudo no reciben tanto como los adultos en programas similares y los adultos “terminan asumiendo más responsabilidad y más costos” para el hogar y los “arreglos para los niños”.
 “La realidad es que los adultos tienen una carga mucho mayor aquí”, dijo, “y por eso es justo que tengamos más compensación dirigida a los adultos”.
 Otra frustración expresada por los afectados por el incendio fue la exigencia de que los participantes renunciaran a su derecho a demandar a la empresa. Los representantes legales de los sobrevivientes del incendio que demandaron a la empresa advirtieron que el programa de conciliación a través de Edison podría privar a las personas de cualquier indemnización por daños y perjuicios que un tribunal pudiera otorgar, así como de una posible compensación o supervisión médica a largo plazo.
 “Estamos abordando esto como una forma de resolver litigios”, dijo Pizarro. “Es una forma de acuerdo legal, y los acuerdos legales suelen ser acuerdos que resuelven todos los asuntos; de lo contrario, no constituyen realmente una conclusión del litigio”.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/010824_Eaton-Fire_JH_28.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-07 13:59:27.635951

Wes Moore (D) decried a new federal job that showed Maryland lost 25,000 federal jobs in 2025 — the most of any state in the nation. (File photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)State officials are decrying new federal jobs numbers that show Maryland lost more than 10,000 federal jobs over two months at the end of last year, bringing the total jobs lost for the year to 25,000.
The report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics confirms that Maryland lost more federal jobs since President Donald Trump took office than any other state in the nation. In sharp remarks Wednesday directed at the Republican administration in Washington, Gov. Wes Moore (D) said  Washington has “broken its pact” with Maryland and with the country.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX“Donald Trump ran on a premise that he alone could fix it,” Moore said during the Board of Public Works meeting Wednesday. “What he didn’t tell the American people was that he alone could break it, and the policies that we continue to see from this White House have continued to make all of our lives harder.”
The updated figures reflect job loses from October and November, when the so-called “fork in the road” job buyout took effect, for federal employees who had the opportunity to resign and receive full pay and benefits until the end of September. State officials said it would be not be until after the deadline when the impact of those decisions would start to be seen.
Federal jobs represent about 6% of the state’s total employment and 10% of the state’s overall wages.
“As I said, months into the new Trump Vance administration, what is happening to the state of Maryland that these are not lancing blows. These are direct shots. They are direct shots that are impacting every single corner of our stat,” Moore said.
The numbers released Wednesday do not come as a surprise. The Board of Revenue Estimates last March projected a reduction of as many as 28,000 federal jobs in the state.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Tom Loftus)FRANKFORT — The cost to expand the headquarters of the Republican Party of Kentucky rose above  $4.4 million in the final quarter of 2025 as the project was completed, according to a report filed this week with the Kentucky Registry of Election Finance.
But more large contributions from special interests during the same period allowed the fund to remain easily in balance. The two largest contributions to the fund during the period were $150,000 from tobacco giant Altria Client Services, of Richmond, Virginia,and $50,000 from The Jockey Club, of New York City, according to the new filing by the Republican Party of Kentucky (RPK) Building Fund .
Both Altria and The Jockey Club had made previous contributions to the fund.
Three years ago Kentucky Lantern first reported that the RPK had begun planning and fundraising for the expansion of its headquarters on Third Street in Frankfort and that the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer had donated a stunning $1 million to the effort.

Over the three years a small number of donors — nearly all corporations or other entities with lobbying interests in Washington and/or Frankfort — have made very large contributions totaling more than $4.4 million to pay for the new structure.
The RPK headquarters is named the “Mitch McConnell Building” in honor of Kentucky’s senior senator who is credited with propelling the ascent of the Republican Party to dominance in the state over the last 40 years. McConnell, the longest-serving U.S. Senate leader in history, led Senate Republicans from 2007 until 2025. He announced last year on his 83rd birthday that he would not seek reelection this year, setting off a crowded race to succeed him.
As for the contributions, Adam Hope, spokesman for the RPK, said, “All funding raised for our expansion was done by the book. Contributions to our building fund are a reflection of the strength of our party and the enthusiasm of our supporters, in Kentucky and beyond, who believe in the progress Republicans are making for the betterment of the Commonwealth.”
The project was made possible by a 2017 law passed by the General Assembly in 2017, the first year that Republicans controlled both chambers of the legislature. Before then, corporations were not allowed to contribute to a state political party, and people were restricted to giving no more than $15,000 a year. But the 2017 law allowed parties to create building funds that could accept contributions from corporations or people in unlimited amounts.
The report filed this week by the RPK Building Fund listed $580,000 in expenses during the last three months of 2025. That brought total spending on the project to a bit over $4.4 million.

By far the largest share of spending — about $3.8 million — was paid to contractor Branscum Construction, of Russell Springs. Stengel-Hill Architects, of Louisville, has been paid about $263,000 through 2025, according to the reports. And the third highest expense has been $195,000 paid to Haney Consulting, the political fundraising business run by Laura Haney, a longtime fundraiser for McConnell as well as other Kentucky Republican causes.
The Kentucky Democratic Party reported one major deposit during the last quarter to its building fund of $499,241. This is apparently most of the proceeds from the sale last fall of its old headquarters on Interstate 64. The Kentucky Lantern reported last month that property records filed in Franklin County show that the party sold the old headquarters property for $540,000 and is now headquartered in offices on Ann Street in Frankfort. 
Morgan Eaves, executive director of the Kentucky Democratic Party, said, “Our focus has not been on a big new building but on policy – policy that will help Kentuckians who are losing health care and other basic needs because of things like the Republican Big Beautiful Bill.”

Last year, lawmakers revised the process for challenging ballot language and, in the same legislation, gave the attorney general power to appeal preliminary injunctions blocking enforcement of state laws or regulations.
Cole County Circuit Judge Daniel Green upheld the provisions on ballot language lawsuits but ruled the new appeals power was an impermissible grant of authority because it was limited to the attorney general.
“There is no compelling governmental interest achieved in allowing only the attorney general to appeal a preliminary injunction where a court has found that a challenged state law is flawed and granted injunctive relief,” Green wrote in his September decision.
In the appeal heard Wednesday, the attorney general’s office sought to undermine the case against the law by arguing that the plaintiff, liberal activist Sean Nicholson, had no standing, or right to sue, over the law. And, Deputy Solicitor General Samuel Freedlund argued, the court  should rule that all the provisions of the law fit easily under the general heading of “judicial proceedings.”
Chiefs in, Royals out: Missouri secretary of state once again catches flak over ballot summary

When the bill was filed in the state Senate, its title said it was about ballot titles written by the General Assembly. The title was changed to be the broader “judicial proceedings” when the bill was amended on the Senate floor.
“The original bill, as introduced, effected judicial proceedings related specifically to ballot title litigation, but this court has made clear, time and time again, that it’s whether the amendments are germane to the overarching purpose,” Freedlund said.
Those arguments ignore constitutional provisions requiring bills to have a single subject, with a clear title, and that everything included in a final version bear a relationship to the subject addressed when the bill was introduced, said Chuck Hatfield, the attorney representing Nicholson.
The legislation, as passed, combined two bills with different subjects and changed provisions of law in two of overarching titles used to organize the statutes, Hatfield noted.
“We think that all of those things point out that the legislature has told us that these were different subjects, these were different purposes,” Hatfield said.
To address the constitutional questions, however, the judges must first resolve whether Nicholson has standing.
Hatfield reminded the court that it has liberally applied the principle of standing in past challenges to state law. 
A person has a right to sue if they are specifically impacted by a new law. The courts also allow any taxpayer to sue if legislation will result in the spending of state funds.
Nicholson satisfies both requirements, Hatfield said. He is a campaign consultant working on ballot measures, so he has a specific interest in how ballot language is determined, he said.
And taxpayer standing doesn’t depend on an identifiable new expense, just that enforcement will cost money, he said.
“You don’t have to show it is tied to a very specific, ‘this amount of money is going to go out the door for this particular thing’,” Hatfield told the judges.
Freedlund, however, said Nicholson was not the correct plaintiff because he is not involved in any pending cases on ballot language and there is no new, direct expense as a result of the law.
“Taxpayer standing requires some sort of direct expenditure,” he argued.
The law is part of a coordinated Republican reaction to liberal ballot initiatives approved by voters enacting laws and constitutional amendments the GOP would not pass through the legislature.
Over the past decade, voters have legalized marijuana, expanded Medicaid eligibility, increased the minimum wage and enacted protections for abortion rights over GOP opposition.
Other legislation to limit the initiative petition process includes a constitutional amendment to change the way majorities are counted that will be on the November ballot and limitations on who can be hired to circulate petitions.
Ballot title challenges are common for both initiative petitions and measures approved for the ballot by lawmakers. Before the new law, if a judge found the ballot language was insufficient or unfairly partisan, the court would revise it.
Under the law, a finding against ballot language means it goes to the secretary of state, who is given up to three chances to rewrite it before the courts take over the job. 
The bill’s provisions governing the revision of ballot language are a reaction to the legal fight over the wording for the abortion rights amendment approved by voters in 2024.
In 2023, Cole County Circuit Judge Jon Beetem ruled the ballot title written by then-Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft was “argumentative” or unfairly biased and rewrote it. That decision was upheld by the Missouri Western District Court of Appeals.
The first use of the new law was during a challenge to the ballot language written for a constitutional amendment passed by lawmakers that would reimpose Missouri’s near-total ban on abortions. Green rejected the original ballot language written by lawmakers. He approved the second revision made by Hoskins, but that version was rewritten again by the Western District Court of Appeals when it ruled the wording drafted by Hoskins was riddled with errors.
The abortion rights amendment from 2024 was also the spur to lawmakers for the language granting special appeal power to the attorney general. 
Planned Parenthood and the ACLU of Missouri sued the state over laws and regulations that prevented Missourians from immediately accessing abortion following the election. 
Jackson County Judge Jerri Zhang found some of the regulations to be unconstitutional under the new abortion rights law and, in two preliminary injunctions, blocked state laws requiring a 72-hour waiting period for abortions, requiring physicians performing abortions have admitting privileges at a local hospital, and requiring a licensing requirement for abortion clinics. 
That allowed surgical abortions to resume but medication abortions, the most common way of ending a pregnancy, are still off-limits.
The case goes to trial next week.
In court on Wednesday, Freedlund defended the grant of power to the attorney general as a reasonable way for the state to protect its interest in seeing that new laws are enforced. 
Green’s ruling incorrectly interpreted how to determine if a law provides equal protections to all people when he ruled against the law, Freedlund said.  
“It’s critical that the circuit court erred at every single step of the analysis, in our view, and any one of those errors was fatal to the trial court’s judgment,” he said.
In his arguments about the powers of the attorney general, Hatfield focused on whether the entire bill should have been tossed out by Green when he found the provision on preliminary injunctions to be unconstitutional.
Instead, Hatfield said, Green severed the bill, allowing the ballot title sections to remain intact while blocking the appeal power section.
Green got that wrong, he said, adding that it will be up to the judges to decide which, if any, provisions remain in law.
“So at the end of the day, like a lot of your cases,” Hatfield said, “this is sort of about line drawing.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/20240404_122730-scaled-e1712257678774-1024x614.jpg,,,2026-01-07 13:59:27.635951

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas legislators will pursue a statewide school cell phone ban, superseding the state education board’s past directives to allow local districts to deal with cell phones as they see fit.
The initiative already has the support of two-thirds of the Senate, according to a joint announcement from Sens. Chase Blasi, an Andale Republican, and Dinah Sykes, a Lenexa Democrat.
If passed into law, Senate Bill 302 would require each local school board and nonpublic school’s governing authority to create policies dictating student cell phone use during instructional time by Sept. 1.
The bill establishes a bell-to-bell mandate, requiring students to power off and store any personal electronic communication devices, and it forces districts to create disciplinary actions and enforcement procedures for any violations. It also allows districts to limit or prohibit cell phone usage during school-sponsored activities that take place outside of normal school hours.
The bill will be a “high priority,” the Tuesday announcement said. It was filed less than a week before the start of the 2026 legislative session.
“Phone-free schools give students space to think, build authentic human relationships and protect student mental health from constant digital pressure,” Blasi said. “The longer phones stay in classrooms, the harder it becomes to undo the damage.”
If the legislation becomes law, it would override local boards’ existing policies if incongruous with the state’s mandates. It also could bolster the Kansas State Board of Education’s previous guidance.
The board unanimously approved a list of recommendations in December 2024 that encouraged districts to adopt bell-to-bell policies that mandate K-12 students’ personal cell phones be powered off from the beginning of the school day to the end, including during lunch and passing periods, and stored in an off-limits location. The recommendations highlighted a need for greater mental health support and parental oversight.
A student can use a device if it is necessary for an education or specialized instruction program or if a doctor deems it medically necessary to support a student’s health and well-being. Students are allowed to contact their parents or guardians through a school telephone, according to the bill’s text.
Sykes said the legislation helps strengthen Kansas schools and teachers.
“Studies show that classrooms without phones have more engaged students leading to face-to-face conversations, stronger peer relationships, safer school environments and better academic outcomes,” she said.
Teachers are not prohibited from using personal communication devices at school, but the bill does require new policies banning school employees “from privately or directly communicating with any student via a social media platform for official school purposes.” A school board or nonpublic school authority can approve a social media platform to be used for official school purposes, the bill said. Private, direct communications are not encompassed in “official school purposes.”
Carrie Rahfaldt, a spokesperson for House Speaker Dan Hawkins, said he is supportive of the legislation.

(National Weather Service photo, courtesy of Candyse Arivett)Gov. Larry Rhoden has asked the federal government to help pay for more than $1.7 million in damage to public property in South Dakota caused by a storm last month.
Wind gusts of 100 miles an hour or more tore through large swaths of western South Dakota and eastern Wyoming Dec. 17-18, causing what a press release from Rhoden’s office called “severe infrastructure damage.” 
Pennington, Custer and Fall River counties were among the most affected, the release says. The National Weather Service logged the highest wind gusts in recorded history at the agency’s monitoring sites in eastern Rapid City and the Rapid City airport during the storm, at 91 and 94 miles per hour, respectively. The top wind gust recorded by the agency during the storm was 101 miles per hour at a location 4 miles south of downtown Rapid City.
Some residents in the Black Hills experienced power outages that lasted a week, according to the weather service.
Rhoden’s disaster declaration, signed on Wednesday, opens the door to possible assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
If FEMA approves the declaration, it could pick up as much as 75% of the price of repairs to public property. Counties would pay 15% of repair costs; the state would pay 10%. 
To qualify for federal aid, an incident must cause at least $1.7 million in damage to public property. The December storm’s damage tally thus far “exceeds that amount,” Rhoden’s press release says.

(Photo by Getty Images)Lawmakers are considering a proposal that could help Maine renters lower electricity costs through the use of solar energy.
State Sen. Nicole Grohoski (D-Hancock) said LD 1730 would allow for small, plug-in solar units so renters and other Mainers can access the renewable energy source without the large upfront investment of traditional panels and without adding costs to the state or other ratepayers. 
“For many of my neighbors, especially those who rent their homes or live in apartments, solar panels seem meant for someone else,” Grohoski said. “If you don’t own your roof or you don’t have thousands of dollars for an upfront investment, the savings that solar generates can feel out of reach.”
When introducing the bill to the Legislature’s Energy, Utilities and Technology Committee during a public hearing Tuesday afternoon, she said these sorts of units cost less to install than traditional roof panels and don’t require any permanent modifications to the property.
Lawmakers in Vermont and New Hampshire are also looking into welcoming these systems, which have already taken off in Europe. More than a million such units have been deployed in Germany.
Grohoski said the portable solar devices would not be included in the state’s net energy billing program because they don’t contribute power back to the grid. Though, the proposal does include a notification process so utilities can know where the units are located for load planning purposes.
Net energy billing, a credit program developed to incentivize the adoption of renewable energy, has been scrutinized in recent years for contributing to rising energy costs, though state officials say the volatility of natural gas prices is a more significant driver. 
The state Department of Energy Resources testified in favor of Grohoski’s proposal Tuesday. Public Advocate Heather Sanborn described these devices as “another tool for affordability” that should be brought into the mix for Maine ratepayers.
“This is not a solution to affordability writ large,” Sanborn said. “This is just another tool in our toolbelt to allow for an all-of-the-above approach to affordability.”
This focus on costs comes as Central Maine Power and Versant customers are slated to see their bills increase by an average of $13 to $17, according to an analysis by the Office of Public Advocate. 
Last month, utility regulators redesigned and expanded eligibility for a program that helps low-income Mainers pay their electric bills. 
Versant Power is opposed to the plug-in solar proposal. The utility said such technology necessitates more robust safety certifications and requirements from the National Electrical Code, which sets the country’s standards for electrical design and installation. However, Versant said it supports customers being able to utilize that sort of technology.
Grohoski’s proposal outlines multiple safety standards. For example, it would include provisions to protect utility line workers and require systems to limit combined output to ensure they don’t overload standard household units.
The bill would also require new buildings with four or more units to provide outdoor outlets so future renters could utilize small solar devices more easily. 
“It’s about giving a person on a third floor apartment the same power to lower their electricity bill as a homeowner who has a south-facing roof,” Grohoski told the committee.
Given the relatively small amount of electricity these devices typically use — it was compared to an air conditioner or a hair dryer (depending on exact size of the unit) by experts during the public hearing — some committee members raised questions as to why this legislation is even needed. 
Versant said it appreciated the notification process outlined in the bill and argued the legislation is necessary since it would exempt these solar devices from the interconnection process and standards.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2169269955-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-07 12:59:04.558689

(Photo by Getty Images, board seal courtesy the State of Iowa) A former University of Iowa Hospitals physician is appealing a court decision tied to an Iowa Board of Medicine investigation into his conduct.
In 2021, the Iowa Board of Medicine charged Dr. Shafik N. Wassef, 42, an Iowa-licensed physician who formerly practiced in Iowa City, with violating patient privacy standards.
A year later, in March 2022, the board amended and expanded its statement of charges in the case, charging Wassef with the added offenses of professional incompetence, practicing in a manner that is harmful or detrimental to the public, and unprofessional conduct.

The board has not publicly disclosed any of the alleged conduct that gave rise to the charges.
In 2024, the board agreed to hand the case off to an administrative law judge. Wassef then sought summary judgment in the matter, which would have resulted in dismissal of the charges before the planned disciplinary hearing could be held.
The administrative law judge denied the request for summary judgment, which prompted Wassef to file a petition in Polk County District Court, seeking judicial review of that decision.
Polk County District Judge David Nelmark then ordered that all court records that “describe the (board’s) investigation and/or the factual basis of the disciplinary charges” against Wassef be sealed from public view.
In a recent ruling, Nelmark granted the state’s request to dismiss Wassef’s lawsuit.
In doing so, Nelmark noted that while he would “not go into the alleged wrongdoing” in the case, the board’s allegations against Wassef “involve HIPAA violations” — a reference to the federal Health Information Portability and Accountability Act, which protects patient records from unwarranted disclosure.
In his lawsuit, Wassef argued the Board of Medicine violated its own rules when it did not identify any evidence to support the disciplinary charges against him when arguing that administrative law judge should deny Wassef’s request that the disciplinary matter be dismissed through summary judgment.
In his decision, Nelmark wrote that it’s clear the board has identified for Wassef the names of the individuals involved in the patient-privacy matter, and the time period in which the alleged violations occurred.
“It is not clear to the court what additional evidence Dr. Wassef was seeking from the board that he did not receive,” Nelmark wrote in his decision. “Dr. Wassef asserts that his actions did not constitute HIPAA violations and that the investigation into his conduct was flawed, but it does not appear that he is unclear as to what the board alleges he did.”
Wassef has appealed Nelmark’s ruling to the Iowa Supreme Court.
Court records indicate Wassef is currently a resident of Florida, where he has an active medical license. In his petition, Wassef argues his Florida license will be adversely affected by the pending disciplinary charges if the case is permitted to proceed to a full disciplinary hearing.
Separately, Wassef is currently suing the University of Iowa Hospitals, alleging that in June 2018, just before his graduation from the UIHC residency program, he was contacted by the hospital’s compliance office and informed he had committed multiple HIPAA violations.
The hospital, Wassef alleges, then filed a complaint against him with the state licensing board and contacted the alleged patient “victims” in the matter to inform them of the situation and invite them to make formal complaints with the board.
The lawsuit, filed in December 2023, alleges the hospital’s allegations are false and have caused “catastrophic professional damage in his field that is ongoing to this day.”
The hospital has denied any wrongdoing. A trial in the case is scheduled for Oct. 13, 2026.

A Wednesday court filing from Commonwealth’s Attorney Miranda King says that the state’s fetal homicide law precludes using it in this case. The statute says “nothing in this chapter shall apply to any acts of a pregnant woman that caused the death of her unborn child.”
The state law “unambiguously exempts the defendant, the infant’s mother,” the filing states. “The Commonwealth has no grounds to pursue prosecution of Count One based on the legislature’s clear decision to exempt and protect the defendant mother’s actions in this matter.”

Kentucky State Police charged the woman, Melinda S. Spencer, 35, with fetal homicide as well as abuse of a corpse and tampering with physical evidence. The latter are both Class D felonies. It’s unclear how far along her pregnancy was. She was indicted Tuesday and set to be arraigned Wednesday. 
King, the prosecutor, said in a statement that she “sought this job with the intention of being a pro-life prosecutor” but must and will follow the law, according to media outlets.

The drastic work project cuts made by House Republican appropriations chair Rep. Ann Bolin, and championed by House Speaker Matt Hall, were accomplished through an unconstitutional process that violated the separation of powers clause and other requirements in the Michigan Constitution, Attorney General Dana Nessel said Wednesday.
The determination came after reports of internal pressure for Michigan House Republicans who have tried to backtrack on the cuts that have affected a number of community services and projects that their constituents counted on.
Nessel was asked to give a formal opinion on the cuts in a request from state Sen. Sarah Anthony (D-Lansing). The attorney general wrote in response that the disapproval mechanism used by Bollin (R-Brighton Township) unconstitutionally allowed one legislative committee to unilaterally terminate funding previously appropriated by the full Legislature and the governor.
In her opinion, Nessel concluded “that this disapproval mechanism violates both the Separation of Powers and Bicameralism and Presentment requirements in the Michigan Constitution.”
The separation of powers requirement limits the ability of one branch of government to exercise the functions of another; the presentment and bicameralism requirements reflect the constitutional mandate that laws must be debated and passed by both houses of the Legislature and presented to and signed by the governor.
Michigan Dems say $645M work project cuts are ‘cruel’; GOP’s Rylee Linting also calls foul

Bollin said in a statement that she believed Nessel was wrong on both the law and the facts, and that her opinion in the matter felt more like “a political defense of Democrats’ pet projects than an objective legal analysis.”
“The House Appropriations Committee acted fully within its legal authority under a law that has been on the books for decades — a statute enacted in the 1980s that clearly allows the Legislature to disapprove work projects that do not meet the standards required by law,” Bollin wrote. “Nothing about that authority is new, and nothing about our action was unconstitutional. What is new is Democrats’ frustration that the days of unchecked slush funds and blank checks are coming to an end.”
Nessel, however, said the disapproval mechanism violated the separation of powers clause because it allowed a single legislative committee “exert control over the executive’s implementation of enacted laws.”
The bicameralism and presentment requirements were violated because “the committee veto doesn’t comply with the constitutional requirement that legislative action be approved by both legislative chambers and presented to the governor, except in only certain narrow and explicit circumstances expressly identified within the Constitution itself.”
“By empowering a single legislative committee to negate the State Budget Director’s work-project designations, the statute reserves the very administrative control that the separation of powers forbids,” Nessel wrote in the opinion. “This disapproval mechanism effectively creates a ‘legislative veto’— or, more accurately, a ‘legislative committee veto.’ This comprises an unconstitutional reservation of administrative control that interferes with the executive branch’s core function of executing the laws. Under Article III, Section 2, when an appropriation is enacted, the Legislature’s role ends, and the executive branch’s duty to faithfully execute the law begins.”
Democrats praise decision
Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids), Anthony and House Minority Floor Leader Ranjeev Puri (D-Canton) each applauded Nessel’s opinion.
“Not only was the House Republicans’ choice to steal money from the people of Michigan heinous, it was also unconstitutional,” Brinks said in a statement. “There’s no surprise here — when they can’t win in the Capitol, they try to bend the rules or break the law, hoping no one notices. But this time, people noticed. Pregnant and new moms who were counting on financial support noticed. Folks trying to combat the opioid epidemic noticed. And advocates for child abuse victims and those who help feed Michigan’s seniors noticed.”
‘Trust cuts both ways’: Nonprofits say Michigan House GOP cuts risk harming vulnerable families

Brinks added that she hopes the thousands of people who reached out in distress over the past month “can breathe a little easier, knowing that this will not stand.”
“This group of Republican legislators is unscrupulous, and everyone should demand better,” Brinks said.
Anthony said the opinion was “a lifeline for the countless non-profit organizations and local governments that have been left in limbo for weeks.”
“I’m talking about county land banks forced to halt affordable housing projects, community centers unable to answer questions from parents about whether their child’s Head Start program will be open this week, and school districts scrambling to make their balance sheet whole — all because House Republicans made a unilateral decision about who is and isn’t worthy of receiving contractually agreed upon state funding,” Anthony said in a statement.
Puri said the cuts amounted to cruelty aimed at some of the House GOP’s own constituents.
“From the moment House Republicans weaponized this rare provision to unilaterally, and without discussion, cut $645 million in appropriated funding for kids with cancer, sexual assault survivors, firefighters and police, and thousands of other cities, non-profits and Michiganders, House and Senate Democrats began fighting back,” Puri said in statement. “The uncertainty and chaos that these attempted cuts caused, not to mention the cruelty in slashing programs for vulnerable moms and babies, veterans and more, was both unprecedented and completely unwarranted.”
Blowback from GOP decision
The cuts are causing problems within the House GOP caucus, Gongwer News Service, a Lansing-based legislative news and intelligence service, reported Monday, noting that House Republicans in vulnerable districts were submitting requests to restore funding for work projects in their own communities — even after their leadership praised the cuts as a way to cut “waste, fraud and abuse,” a mantra the House majority repeated throughout the 2025-26 budget process.
Gongwer reported that Republican state Rep. Ron Robinson of Utica, who voted against the cuts, still called them “well-intentioned.”
State Rep. Kathy Schmaltz (R-Jackson) was also a House GOP member facing a tough election fight, and has told her constituents in a news release that the money had been simply paused. As Gongwer noted, the money was not paused, it was canned by House leadership.
In another odd twist, State Rep. Jim DeSana (R-Carleton) was among the members who voted for the cuts — which ultimately slashed nearly $2 million in state funding going to repair the roof of a building named after his father, The Detroit News reported.
Bollin went on the defend her committee’s actions, noting that Nessel “has never voted on a budget, never analyzed a state budget, and now appears perfectly comfortable defending a system where hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars were shuffled through vague work projects with little oversight and no accountability.”
“That is not how responsible government works, and it is not what Michigan taxpayers expect,” Bollin said. “It’s also worth remembering that Attorney General Nessel herself was hiding all of her department’s operations under a single line item until House Republicans stepped in this year to demand transparency and add accountability to her spending. That experience makes this opinion especially hard to take seriously.”
Bollin remained adamant that the Legislature had both the authority and the responsibility to oversee the spending of taxpayer dollars.
“We exercised that responsibility lawfully and in the best interest of the people of Michigan,” Bollin said. “Political opinions from the Attorney General’s office will not change that reality, nor will they deter House Republicans from continuing to restore accountability to state government.”

No pressure, Mississippi, but the Southeastern Conference hasn’t gone three years without a football national championship since the turn of the century.
Big Ten teams won the last two national titles — 2023 Michigan and 2024 Ohio State — and with No. 1 Indiana matched against No. 5 Oregon in the Peach Bowl on Friday, the conference is assured of being represented in the championship game again.
The last SEC team to play for it all was Georgia, which hammered TCU 65-7 in 2022 for its second straight title and the conference’s fourth in a row.
The “It Just Means More” conference hasn’t gone three years without a title since a four-year stretch from 1999-2002.
LSU won the Bowl Championship Series title game in 2003 but shared the title with Southern California. From 2006-22, the SEC won 13 of 17 championships and had at least one team in the title game all but one year.
The picks, with seedings and lines from BetMGM Sportsbook:
No. 6 Mississippi (plus 3 1/2) vs. No. 10 Miami
The Rebels (13-1) are as much a feel-good story as Indiana, maybe even more. The plot: Coach (Lane Kiffin) ditches team for a job with a conference rival (LSU), new coach (Pete Golding) opens his tenure with two playoff victories and several assistants stay on while moonlighting at LSU during the playoff run. Oh, and the star of the team (QB Trinidad Chambliss) is a transfer from Division II Ferris State. All this has galvanized the Rebels.
Against Miami, the challenge will be keeping Chambliss upright. The Hurricanes (12-2) have a combined 12 sacks in playoff wins over Texas A&M and Ohio State, and lead the nation with 46. The Rebels have kept Chambliss mostly clean, allowing just one sack in three games since Florida got to him five times on Nov. 15.

Miami QB Carson Beck has shaken off his interception issue with offensive coordinator Shannon Dawson’s emphasis on spreading around short passes. Beck has thrown just one interception in the last six games; he was picked off nine times in the first eight.
Pick: Mississippi 28-27
No. 1 Indiana (minus 3 1/2) vs. No. 5 Oregon
The Hoosiers and Ducks were dominant in the quarterfinals and now they square off for the second time this season. Indiana (14-0) handed Oregon (13-1) its only loss, 30-20 in Eugene on Oct. 11. The winner of the rematch will play for its school’s first national championship in football.

Much attention is paid to Indiana’s offense with Fernando Mendoza leading the way. He is going to have to be sharp against an Oregon defense that has improved its pass coverage since the first meeting. The Ducks flummoxed Behren Morton in the 23-0 quarterfinal win over Texas Tech.
This game will be close, and the Hoosiers have the more consistent defense. Remember, James Madison found a way to move the ball against Oregon in the first round, and the Hoosiers have the Heisman Trophy winner in Mendoza.

What may be less common is for politicians on the left to look back, or call attention to that.
And that’s where Brian Miller comes in.
A Helena-based attorney and student of the Federalist Papers, he, like some politicians, believes that America has strayed from its high-minded ideals.
And, the Democrat will try to unseat Republican incumbent Congressman Troy Downing, said that those in the center and left must reclaim the wisdom and vision of the nation’s founders because many of their ideas, especially about the separation of powers and limitations of government, can be a guide to escape the current cycle of political gridlock.
Miller told the Daily Montanan before the holidays “revolutionary” approaches are needed to overcome the challenges of housing, healthcare and the economy — and by revolutionary, he means a return to the some of the principles of the founders.
As for leaders like President Donald Trump, Miller said history has already spoken.
“He is using what (the founders) called ‘tyrannical use of power,’” Miller said. “He’s doing what the founding fathers said a tyrant does.”
 

  About Brian Miller 

Born: 1972 (Cleveland, Ohio)
Education: Bachelor’s degree, Emory University; Juris Doctorate, University of Montana
Status: Divorced, two children (Sage and Owen)
Website: https://www.miller4congress.com/



Miller jumped into the race because of his two children, Sage and Owen, and his love for the country and state.
“What I want people to think about is: What are we doing and where are we going?” he asked.
Although he’s running as a Democrat, Miller doesn’t describe himself as necessarily partisan. He said he’s more worried about the growing economic divide and the mountain of debt the country is accumulating— something he said will take a bipartisan effort to correct.
“If we don’t fix it, it will be destructive and hugely catastrophic,” Miller said.
He also said that it’s time to “decelerate” wealth accumulation, pointing out that the top 10% of Americans have two-thirds of the nation’s wealth, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.
“You want to talk about affordability? There it is,” Miller said. “There is an insane concentration of wealth and money all going to a few people. We do not want socialism, but this is way out of whack. There is an unhealthy concentration of wealth and it will end up killing the economy.”
He plans to focus his year campaigning on making things like housing, childcare and healthcare more affordable. Miller advocates for more equity in taxing, especially when it comes to individual versus corporate taxation. He says the difference is fundamental and would require a shift away from the demands of short-term money to longer term growth.
Miller opposes Trump and the Republicans’ approach to tariffs, saying it’s among the most regressive form of taxation.
“Billionaires don’t care if a car is an extra $10,000,” Miller said. “You only notice when you’re making less than $50,000.”
Congressional candidate Brian Miller.
He said American businesses, regardless of politics, are paralyzed by the uncertainty that presidential politics has played. Miller said nowhere is that more obvious than in the agricultural sector. He pointed to examples of trade deals collapsing for soybeans and sky-rocketing input prices for feed and fertilizer.
“It’s unfair to blame the affordability crisis on Trump, but everything he’s done is making it worse,” Miller said.
He said the structural issues of increasing home prices, stagnant wages and housing shortages have been perennial problems, but Miller said Trump should be judged by what he said he could do.
“And he said he was the guy who would fix it all,” Miller said.
  Health insurance 

Miller also sees obvious solutions in American healthcare, beginning with the cost per capita and the health outcomes. He looks at Germany and sees Americans paying nearly double what it spends. While Germany spends around $300 yearly on administrative costs, America’s average is about triple.
“I am not saying a single-payer solution is the answer, but there’s a broad consensus that the problem is insurance companies,” he said.
He said government’s role in healthcare has yielded a positive benefit from providing more healthcare via Medicaid expansion to guaranteeing a market to businesses who found a cure for COVID by offering to buy the product. He said COVID and the vaccination, often maligned by some conservatives, shows perfectly how the government can be involved in helping to create solutions.
  Mounting debt 

Miller said despite conservative politicians talking about the debt, neither political party has done a lot to stop it recently. He worries the window of time to solve the looming financial crisis is closing.
He said that runs a close parallel to what the British colonists in America saw, which led to the Revolutionary War: A mother country which kept on pushing the colonies to the brink of financial collapse.
“Hamilton referred to the British as ‘economic enslavers,’” Miller said.
He said those feelings of being trapped with few ways out don’t so much resonate with older voters, but he’s said they’ve been embraced by younger voters.
“These conditions have become too extreme,” Miller said. “And both parties have a poverty of ideas.”
One of the thoughts that Miller wants to focus on is the misguided-but-popular sentiment from another Republican of his youth, Ronald Reagan. Though Miller credits Reagan for his charisma and communication, he said his messaging was wrong.
“We need to get away from this idea that government is your mortal enemy,” Miller said. “The government is not an alien force that wants to invade.”

Miller filed with the Federal Election Commission to run on Oct. 9, 2025.
According to the Federal Election website, Dr. Michael Eisenhauer of Great Falls filed to run in the race as an Independent on Dec. 15, 2025.

The Trump administration’s focus on Minnesota was sparked by unsubstantiated allegations shared by right-wing media figures that Somali Americans who committed fraud were using the proceeds to fund terrorist organizations abroad.
“@POTUS Trump and @Sec_Noem have rallied DHS law enforcement personnel to keep Americans safe and ERADICATE fraud,” DHS posted on X.
ICE did not respond to the Reformer’s requests for comment.
Immigrant rights organizations have been fielding many reports of ICE arrests around the metro, but an exact number of arrests is difficult to confirm. Unlike a few high-profile raids in Minneapolis and St. Paul in 2025, which involved dozens of agents and attracted large crowds, ICE appears to be focused on conducting smaller and faster operations.
Walz blasted the deployment as a waste of government resources on social media, sharing a video from a little over a week ago showing dozens of agents leading a single person out of a Hennepin County government building. He said the Trump administration did not give his office advance notice or any additional information on the operation.
“We have a ridiculous surge of apparently 2,000 people not coordinating with us that are for a show of the cameras,” Walz said at a news conference on Tuesday. “We don’t even know they are, they’ll be wearing masks.”
Noem fired back at the governor for accusing them of misusing taxpayer dollars given the widening scandal of fraud in state-run social service programs that led him to end his campaign for a third term on Monday.
Around the country and in Minnesota, immigration agents have been accused of violating constitutional rights: detaining U.S. citizens for days, targeting individuals based on their speech; and arresting and holding people without probable cause.

In late December, ICE agents entered a private area of the Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis without a judicial warrant, according to immigrant rights activists and Democratic elected officials, who urged Hennepin Healthcare to adopt a clear policy and train employees on how to interact with immigration agents.
Janna Gewirtz O’Brien, a pediatrician and president-elect of the Minnesota Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said fear of ICE is keeping immigrant families from seeking health care.
“There is a sense of fear that has been perpetuated by our administration, and we need hospitals to step up,” Gewirtz O’Brien said.
The American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota and three Minnesota-based law firms recently sued federal immigration authorities, alleging that ICE agents and their leaders are also routinely violating the constitutional rights of the people protesting their actions.

Sept. 5, 2023. (Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)With Maine Gov. Janet Mills set to term out after eight years, the field for the November 2026 gubernatorial election is packed with candidates with a spectrum of experience and views. 
Those running as either Democrats or Republicans will first face off against each other in the June 9, 2026 primaries in an effort to win over their base and secure their party’s nomination.
Open to all Maine voters, the primaries will be a ranked-choice ballot, though the general election in November will not. With at least one political heavyweight, Maine Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford, opting out of either major political party, it remains to be seen how that could influence Maine’s historically independent electorate.
The field is already crowded with several well known names vying for the Democratic Party nomination, including Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, former Senate President Troy Jackson, former speaker of the Maine House of Representatives and daughter of a U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, Hannah Pingree, and Angus King III, son of Maine’s independent U.S. senator.
Whoever becomes Maine’s next governor will take the helm for the remaining two years of President Donald Trump’s second term, and will have to navigate massive cuts in funding, the dismantling of federal agencies and programs, and greater pressure on states to conform with his agenda amid increased economic uncertainty.
Here’s the latest on the race for Maine governor.

Former Senate Majority Leader Mason announces 2026 gubernatorial run


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Wednesday January 7, 2026 11:51 am





Former Maine Senate Majority Leader Garrett Mason announced his run to replace outgoing Gov. Janet Mills on his podcast Wednesday morning, framing his campaign around the need for experienced leadership.
Mason, a Republican from Lisbon who spent eight years in the Maine Legislature and now works as a lobbyist, ran for governor in 2018 and was the runner up in the primary. On Wednesday, he commented on the crowded race he’s joining, saying he is the only Republican candidate with prior experience and understanding of how the Legislature works.
While state Sen. James Libby is among those running, the GOP primary field is packed with candidates with mostly business experience, such as former Planet Fitness president Ben Midgley, health care entrepreneur Jonathan Bush and David Jones, a construction and real estate business leader.
On the podcast, he said many candidates on both sides are “promising things that a governor cannot deliver on at all, or immediately.”
“The reason I’m running is very simple,” Mason said. “It’s not because I have better ideas. It’s because I know how to actually turn those ideas into results.”

Independent who previously tried to challenge Sen. Collins announces gubernatorial bid


By: AnnMarie Hilton - Friday November 7, 2025 3:57 pm





Another independent candidate has entered the race for Maine’s next governor. 
Derek Levasseur, who describes himself as a small business leader and published a memoir earlier this year about overcoming adversity, announced his plans to run for governor as an independent in a Facebook post Thursday. He filed paperwork with the Maine Ethics Commission the same day listing a Benton address. 
Levasseur said his focus is lowering the cost of living and reforming the state Department of Health and Human Services to increase accountability. He proposes eliminating property taxes on people’s primary homes and increasing government transparency.

Maine House Speaker Fecteau backs Pingree for governor


By: Lauren McCauley and AnnMarie Hilton -  1:44 pm





The Speaker of the Maine House of Representatives announced his top choice for Maine’s next governor.
At the former Biddeford Courthouse Friday afternoon, House Speaker Ryan Fecteau (D-Biddeford) said he is backing Hannah Pingree in next year’s gubernatorial election.
He said Pingree, who also previously served as the leader of the legislature’s lower chamber and most recently as head of the state’s Office of Policy Innovation and the Future, has the leadership necessary to defend Maine from federal attacks and continue the work the state has done in recent years under a Democratic trifecta.
“As we watch the dysfunction and cruelty coming from Washington, it’s clear that we need leaders that will stand up for Maine people, for the food assistance they need, for the health care every person deserves, for smart forward-looking policies that will protect our state from climate change,” said Fecteau, who was flanked by roughly 20 current and former legislators.
“We need someone who will stand up to the Trump administration and the ridiculous ongoing attacks on the most vulnerable Mainers,” he continued. “Hannah Pingree is that person.”

Former Maine CDC director Nirav Shah joins governor’s race


By: AnnMarie Hilton - Monday October 20, 2025 10:50 am





The doctor who led Maine through the Covid-19 pandemic and later moved to a national public health position is running for governor. 
Nirav Shah announced Monday he will throw his name into an already crowded field of Democrats vying for the Blaine House. Shah was appointed as the director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention in 2019. He held that role until he became principal deputy director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2023.
“As Maine CDC Director, I saw how we could get through incredibly tough times together with empathy, resilience, and vision,” Shah said in a news release. “I’ll bring those same values as governor to tackle big challenges: the unsustainable increases to the cost of living and housing, an economy that’s not delivering for people, and a rural health care system that’s struggling and will only get worse because of [President Donald] Trump.”

Republican Jonathan Bush launches bid for governor


By: Lauren McCauley - Wednesday October 8, 2025 4:49 pm





Jonathan Bush, nephew of the late President George H.W. Bush, officially launched his campaign for governor on Wednesday, running as a Republican to replace outgoing Gov. Janet Mills in the 2026 election.
Branding himself as a “disruptor, a job creator and a fanatic Maine optimist,” the health care entrepreneur launched his campaign at the Belfast headquarters of athenahealth, a company he founded in 1997 but was eventually ousted from.
In a launch video, Bush outlined some of the changes he hopes to make as governor, including auditing the government, investing in trade schools and jumpstarting the economy “by getting rid of silly regulations.”
“To change things, I’m going to have to break a few eggs along the way,” he said in the video.

State Rep. Ed Crockett enters Maine governor’s race as independent


By: Emma Davis - Thursday September 25, 2025 5:07 pm





Rep. Ed Crockett of Portland has entered the race for Maine’s next governor. And, he’s the second sitting legislator who has unaffiliated from a political party to run as an independent.
Crockett, who until recently had been a Democrat, announced his intention to run for higher office in an op-ed earlier this summer, in which he condemned what he described as a Legislature “stuck in a morass of partisanship.” Crockett is approaching his eighth and final year serving in the Maine House of Representatives before he’ll be termed out.
That critique echoes why Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford, formerly a Republican, similarly said he decided to run as an independent for governor earlier this year
With Crockett in the running, there are now 17 candidates in the open race to replace Gov. Janet Mills, who terms out in 2026. Crockett is the third independent, along with Bennett and John Glowa, a retired environmental specialist.

Jackson rallies with Sanders and Platner on Labor Day


By: Lauren McCauley - Wednesday September 3, 2025 10:02 am





Gubernatorial candidate Troy Jackson joined U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and U.S. Senate candidate Graham Platner at a packed rally at the Cross Insurance Arena in Portland on Labor Day.
Addressing the crowd of 6,500, Jackson used his speech to differentiate himself from other Democratic candidates.
“We have tried it their way and it doesn’t work,” said Jackson, a fifth-generation logger from Allagash. “It’s time for regular folks to take the wheel. Hell, we built the wheel.”
Sanders, an independent who ran twice for the Democratic nomination for president, endorsed both Jackson and Platner in their respective races.

Former Maine CDC head Dr. Nirav Shah considering bid for governor


By: Lauren McCauley - Friday August 15, 2025 2:53 pm





Another popular figure in Maine is considering a run for governor. 
Dr. Nirav Shah told the Portland Press Herald in an interview Friday that he’s considering entering the race as a Democrat, which would have him joining a field already crowded with well-known players in Maine politics.  
Shah became a household figure as head of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention during the COVID-19 pandemic, holding daily briefings during which he would answer questions and provide updates on the public health crisis. He often appeared alongside Maine officials, including Gov. Janet Mills. 
He told the paper that experience gave him an appreciation for the impact state government can make on people’s lives.
“What attracted me in particular to the governor’s office is the impact you can have in the executive branch,” Shah said.
In January 2023, he was appointed as the principal deputy director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention under former President Joe Biden. Recently, he returned to Maine to launch a public health education program at Colby College, where he is a visiting professor.









Retired DEP employee is third independent to join the race for governor


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Thursday August 7, 2025 5:44 pm





A former longtime state government employee is running for governor as an independent.
John Glowa of South China is the most recent candidate to add his name to the growing list of gubernatorial candidates. So far, 16 people have entered the race, including three independents.
The most prominent of those is State Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford, who left the Republican Party earlier this year to announce his run, in addition to Dover-Foxcroft resident Alexander Murchison, according to the Maine Ethics Commission website.
Glowa worked for the Maine Department of Environmental Protection as an environmental specialist from 1987 until 2016, according to his campaign website. He then retired and ran for state representative as a member of the Democratic Party, and then for a seat in the Maine Senate.
He also founded the Maine Wolf Coalition, which advocates for wolf recovery in the northeast, and has accused state wildlife officials of deliberately downplaying evidence of wolves’ presence in the state.

Here are the Republicans vying to replace Gov. Janet Mills next November


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Wednesday August 6, 2025 8:04 am





Ben Midgley, a fitness executive from Kennebunkport, on Tuesday officially became the seventh Republican candidate in a crowded race for Gov. Janet Mills’ seat.
Midgley is the latest of 17 officially registered candidates vying to replace Mills, a Democrat who terms out next year. Both the Republican and Democratic primaries, slated for June 9, 2026, are open to all Maine voters. The primaries will be a ranked-choice ballot though the general election for governor in November will not.
Most of the Republican candidates listed on the Maine Ethics Commission website have not held public office at the state level, with the exception of state Sen. Jim Libby (R-Standish). Bobby Charles, a lawyer who served under former Republican presidents, and former Paris selectman Robert Wessels have also been involved in politics in different capacities.
In contrast, the Democratic field is stacked with party leaders, including Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, former Senate President Troy Jackson, and former Speaker of the Maine House of Representative and Mills administration official Hannah Pingree, among others.
Other GOP candidates, including University of Maine System trustee Owen McCarthy, tout their financial credentials while framing themselves as political outsiders. All seven appear to have varying stances on issues including the economy, education and immigration, but almost all have expressed concern about the increasing cost of living in Maine, which according to a Pan Atlantic Research poll conducted this year was the biggest concern expressed by voters.

Republican Sen. Rick Bennett announces independent bid for Maine governor


By: Emma Davis - Tuesday June 24, 2025 12:03 pm





After decades of public service as a Republican, state Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford announced on Tuesday that he is running for governor as an independent.
“My candidacy is not an indictment of either party,” Bennett told Maine Morning Star in an interview. “It’s an indictment of the party structure and parties as the solution to solving our problems.”
Calling his independent bid liberating, Bennett said he intends to take his message — one of fiscal responsibility — directly to Maine people and not a subset of the electorate, an approach he sees as a return to Maine’s independent tradition.
“I see politics beginning to slide more towards the politics of Washington,” Bennett said, “and I think we have the opportunity as Maine people to say no to that.”

Hannah Pingree officially launches bid for governor


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Tuesday June 10, 2025 7:02 am





Hannah Pingree officially launched her campaign for governor after months of speculation about the candidacy of the former Mills administration official and speaker of the Maine House of Representatives.
She kicked off the campaign with several planned stops around the state on Tuesday, starting with a rally in Rockland, scheduled meetings with local leaders in Lewiston and Biddeford before capping off the day with a celebration in Portland.
Pingree left her role as head of Gov. Janet Mills’ Office of Policy Innovation and the Future, also known as GOPIF, which she held since 2019. The office was created to recommend policy solutions for some of the state’s biggest issues including climate change, housing, workforce development, the opioid crisis and more.

Republican state senator enters race for governor


By: AnnMarie Hilton - Thursday May 22, 2025 12:01 pm





State Sen. James Libby is running in the 2026 gubernatorial race.
Libby, who represents parts of Cumberland, Oxford and York counties, is one of five Republican candidates contending for the Blaine House, according to filings with the Maine Ethics Commission.
The race is already starting to get crowded, with the Democratic ticket drawing notable names including Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, who announced her bid in late March, as well as Angus King III, the son of independent U.S. senator and former governor Angus King Jr., who announced his run earlier this month.
Libby is in the middle of his second consecutive term in the Senate, but he has also spent time as a state representative after being first elected to the Legislature in 1992. He also ran in the 2002 Republican gubernatorial primary.

Former Maine Senate President Troy Jackson is running for governor in the 2026 election.
The fifth-generation logger announced Monday that he will join the Democratic primary, saying in a news release from his campaign that “too many Democrats have lost touch with working people or shown they’re not up to the fight.”
“I know what it’s like to punch a clock, live paycheck to paycheck, be treated like I didn’t matter while some billionaire got rich off my back – and how to turn that feeling of powerlessness into action,” he added.

Amid rumors of gubernatorial bid, Hannah Pingree to leave Mills administration


By: AnnMarie Hilton - Thursday May 15, 2025 5:58 pm





Hannah Pingree, who has led efforts on climate and housing policy for the state, will leave her position Friday.
“I’m so grateful to Governor Mills for the tremendous opportunity she gave me to dive into Maine’s biggest challenges and lead work across her administration to chart a path to solutions,” Pingree said in a news release from the governor’s office Thursday.
Though the release didn’t specify what Pingree plans to do next, she said she will “remain relentlessly focused on the future of the state we all love.” The Bangor Daily News has reported that Pingree is expected to throw her hat in the ring for the Democratic gubernatorial primary next year.

By: Eesha Pendharkar - Wednesday March 26, 2025 7:53 am





Secretary of State Shenna Bellows announced her run for governor in 2026, becoming the first major Democratic candidate to throw her hat in the ring.
During her address early Wednesday at the official launch event at the Hancock Community Center, Bellows said “we need leaders who will meet the moment.”
“Because while we’re paying our taxes or helping our parents measure out their medication, our country is being demolished by a greedy, unelected billionaire who thinks his dollars are more powerful than our voices…Who thinks the value of his stock portfolio matters more than the values of our community.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-07 16:47:52+00:00,CT Mirror,Avelo Airlines to exit deportation business,Thomas Breen | New Haven Independent,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/07/avelo-airlines-to-exit-deportation-business/,The airline will stop running deportation flights for the Trump administration after deciding its participation is too complex and costly to continue.,"Avelo Airlines plans to stop running deportation flights for the Trump administration later this month after deciding that its participation in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) program is too complex and costly to continue.
Avelo spokesperson Courtney Goff confirmed that coming move for the budget airline in an email comment sent to the Independent on Wednesday.
“Avelo will close the base at AZA [in Mesa, Arizona] on January 27 and will conclude participation in the DHS charter program,” Goff wrote. “The program provided short-term benefits but ultimately did not deliver enough consistent and predictable revenue to overcome its operational complexity and costs.”
AZ Family, a local news outlet in Phoenix, first reported on Avelo’s decision to end its deportation flights, which began out of Arizona last May — prompting a New Haven-based boycott movement, condemnation from politicians and activists across the country, and frequent protests outside of Tweed New Haven Airport, where Avelo has been flying direct commercial flights (but not deportation flights) since November 2021.
Avelo CEO Andrew Levy previously defended the company’s decision to run deportation flights on financial grounds, stating that the DHS contract was necessary to maintain Avelo’s operations, including its service of New Haveners. Click here to read an American Prospect report from November 2025 on Avelo’s “sloppy, dangerous deportation flights.”
“The big lesson here is that human suffering is not profitable,” said Pastor Jack Perkins Davidson of Hamden’s Spring Glen Church in a phone interview with the Independent Wednesday. “I hope Avelo and all corporations in the U.S. have learned that valuable lesson, that collaborating with injustice and collaborating with racism, though it may for them provide the allure of short-term gain, are empty promises. There is no benefit.”
Avelo doubles down on Tweed
Goff’s confirmation of Avelo’s decision to stop flying deportation flights also comes a day after she sent out a separate email press release Tuesday night under the subject line: “Avelo Airlines Reiterates Long-Term Commitment to Connecticut.”
“Avelo Airlines has been recapitalized, and its cash position is now one of the strongest in the U.S. airline industry relative to its size,” that Tuesday press release states. “The airline will use this cash infusion and balance sheet strength to execute its long-term strategy, with emphasis on further developing its key base at Tweed-New Haven Airport (HVN).”
The press release states that Avelo will “continue to operate a six-aircraft base” at Tweed “without major changes to the existing network or to its Crewmember employment at the airport.”
Across the country, Avelo will be “streamlining its network” around four different locations: New Haven’s Tweed airport (HVN); Wilmington, Delaware’s ILG airport; Charlotte, North Carolina’s Douglas International Airport (USA), and Lakeland, Florida’s airport (LAL). Avelo will also open a base at the McKinney, Texas airport (TKI) in “late 2026,” and it will close bases in Mesa, Arizona (AZA); Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina (RDU); and Wilmington, North Carolina (ILM).
“Concurrent with these network changes, Avelo will make near-term schedule changes that will impact many Customer itineraries. Communication will be sent directly to impacted Customers by email and text. Customers needing additional help can seek assistance from Avelo’s Customer Support Center.”
Avelo will also modify its fleet to remove six Boeing Next-Generation 737-700 aircraft, “leaving the airline primarily operating its more efficient Boeing Next-Generation 737-800 aircraft. These changes enable Avelo to focus on sustainably scaling five core bases in 2026 and to prepare the company for growth in the coming years, facilitated by the company’s recent order for up to 100 Embraer 195-E2 aircraft.”
Tuesday’s press release ends by stating that Avelo will continue to fly directly from Tweed to the following 24 destinations:

Atlanta, Ga. (ATL)
Charleston, S.C. (CHS)
Charlotte / Concord, N.C. (USA)
Chicago, Ill. (via ORD)
Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas (DFW)
Daytona Beach, Fla. (DAB)

Tampa, Fla. (TPA)
Washington, D.C./Baltimore, Md. (BWI)
West Palm Beach, Fla. (PBI)
Wilmington, N.C. (ILM)

“New Haven is Avelo’s largest base – employing nearly 300 Crewmembers and offering service to 24 nonstop destinations,” Tuesday’s press release states. “Since taking flight from HVN in November 2021, Avelo has flown more than four million Customers at Tweed on over 30,000 flights.”
All of this comes as Tweed New Haven Airport continues to move forward with plans to extend its runway and build a new, larger terminal on the East Haven side of the property in a bid to attract more commercial airfare. Avelo and fellow budget airline Breeze are the only two commercial carriers currently operating out of Tweed. Critics of the airport’s expansion, meanwhile, have consistently warned of increased flooding, air pollution, and excess noise and traffic that comes with a larger airport.

The Alzheimer’s Association Delaware Valley Chapter has launched a new free online tool aimed at helping Delaware residents evaluate their daily habits and take steps to support long-term brain health.
The Brain Health Habit Builder is a web-based, interactive experience that takes about three to five minutes to complete. Users answer questions about their lifestyle, then receive a personalized plan focused on small, manageable changes tied to brain health. The plan can be downloaded, printed, or shared, and the tool is accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.
“Healthy habits can help you live better now and protect your memory and thinking as you age,” said Kristina Fransel, executive director of the Alzheimer’s Association Delaware Valley Chapter. “This new tool makes it easy to check your habits and build a personalized plan to support lifelong brain health.”
RELATED STORY: Delaware Faces an Alzheimer’s Surge—and a Growing Web of Challenges
The recommendations generated by the tool are informed by findings from the U.S. POINTER study, a large clinical trial that examined whether lifestyle interventions could improve cognitive function in older adults at risk for cognitive decline. The study found that a combination of physical activity, healthy eating, cognitive and social engagement, and regular health monitoring led to improved cognition.
Brain health refers to how well people think, learn, and remember. While research continues to evolve, studies increasingly suggest that addressing certain risk factors — such as inactivity, poor diet, and social isolation — may help reduce the risk of cognitive decline and possibly dementia.
The Alzheimer’s Association has expanded its public education efforts in recent years, offering community programs across Delaware and sharing research-based guidance through initiatives like its 10 Healthy Habits for Your Brain campaign.
The Brain Health Habit Builder is the first in a series of new resources planned by the organization following the release of the U.S. POINTER study results. Future initiatives include virtual brain health training for health care providers, a community recognition program highlighting businesses that promote brain-healthy practices, and a brain health roundtable designed to bring together leaders from health care, public health, and the private sector.
“The Alzheimer’s Association is committed to ensuring individuals have the information they need to routinely and meaningfully take action to improve their brain health,” Fransel said. “Making even small changes to improve brain health can make a big difference.”
Delaware residents can access the Brain Health Habit Builder at alz.org/habitbuilder.

Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia MercurySince last summer the Virginia Department of Health has been investigating a potential pediatric cancer cluster in Southwest Virginia. On Wednesday, the agency announced it determined that the cancer rates don’t meet federal standards to be officially defined as a cancer cluster. 
Cancer clusters are defined as a greater than expected number of the same or related cancer cases that occur within a group of people in the same area over a specific time. Cancer clusters are rare, but could be indicative of environmental exposures or genetic predispositions but they sometimes randomly occur. VDH’s analysis of cases between 2014 and 2023 in the Scott County area of Virginia do not meet the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention definition for a cluster. 
Though an official cluster has not been determined, the regional health district director emphasized that health officials are still keeping their eyes on matters — especially since some data for 2024 and 2025 are not yet finalized.
“The results of the current investigation are being shared, but our work will not stop here,” said LENOWISCO Health District Director Reisa Sloce. “We will continue to provide the Virginia Cancer Registry with any additional pediatric cancer information we receive to ensure the most recent cases are reviewed as that data becomes more complete.”
Data takes time to be finalized as it must be verified, analyzed and exchanged with other state registries. A two-year lag in health data is common across other states, so VDH plans to review the most recent data once the formal procedures make it fully available. 
As to what VDH has learned so far, it received 24 survey responses from residents of Scott, Lee and Wise countries. Half of the reports stemmed from Scott, so much of the investigation focused in that area. A total of eight cases of pediatric cancers from survey responses met the criteria for the analysis. 
Staff reviewed each patient’s medical reports to confirm the type of cancer, where the cancer originated within the patient’s body and when it was diagnosed. The reviews included doctors’ notes and test results. Environmental factors were also examined such as radon levels, drinking water quality, and industrial site concerns but no link to environmental factors were identified in VDH’s analysis. 
The Virginia Mercury also conducted its own survey but only received one response. That person did not have pediatric cancer, but was an adult who had cancer in 2015 and said it had returned last year. The person was from Scott County. 
With a cancer cluster ruled out for now, fresh data will be on the horizon. 
In the meantime, Sloce reiterated how state health workers “strive to connect you with available resources and address health related concerns.”

(Photo via Garrett Mason official Maine Senate Facebook page)Former Maine Senate Majority Leader Garrett Mason announced his run to replace outgoing Gov. Janet Mills on his podcast Wednesday morning, framing his campaign around the need for experienced leadership.
Mason, a Republican from Lisbon who spent eight years in the Maine Legislature and now works as a lobbyist, ran for governor in 2018 and was the runner up in the primary. On Wednesday, he commented on the crowded race he’s joining, saying he is the only Republican candidate with prior experience and understanding of how the Legislature works. 
While state Sen. James Libby is among those running, the GOP primary field is packed with candidates with mostly business experience, such as former Planet Fitness president Ben Midgley, health care entrepreneur Jonathan Bush and David Jones, a construction and real estate business leader.
On the podcast, he said many candidates on both sides are “promising things that a governor cannot deliver on at all, or immediately.”
“The reason I’m running is very simple,” Mason said. “It’s not because I have better ideas. It’s because I know how to actually turn those ideas into results.”
The former Senate majority leader emphasized that Maine requires seasoned leadership at such a crucial moment for the state, not someone who tries to imitate Donald Trump or a political “hobbyist.” 
Mason admitted to having similar views to the other Republican candidates, highlighting key talking points for the party including overtaxation and government inefficiency, education reform, and rising crime — despite the most recent state report showing crime declining steadily since 2021. 
But drawing on his past roles as a business owner and legislator, Mason set himself apart as someone who could bring practical experience to the job. His entry into the race signals a major development in the Republican primary. 
“I’ve heard a lot of people in the Republican primary talk about how they’re an outsider,” he said. “There are times for outsiders. There are times that we need somebody to come in and rattle up the system. This is not this time. This moment requires precision. It requires institutional knowledge, and it involves understanding the real levers of power.”

Jim Pillen touts $10 million campaign war chest ahead of 2026 reelection bid,Juan Salinas II,,,,,https://nebraskaexaminer.com/briefs/nebraska-gov-jim-pillen-touts-10-million-campaign-war-chest-ahead-of-2026-reelection-bid/,Pillen's haul sets steep cost of challenging sitting governor as potential GOP rematch with Charles Herbster looms.,"Gov. Jim Pillen at Nebraska’s National Guard Air Base on Jan 5, 2026. (Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Fresh off securing President Donald Trump’s endorsement, Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen announced his campaign has raised $7.6 million, bringing the governor’s political war chest to $10 million ahead of his 2026 reelection bid. 
The incumbent governor’s fundraising haul comes as a potential Republican primary election rematch is on the horizon with multi-state agribusinessman Charles Herbster, a longtime Trump donor. 
The Pillen campaign said the amount is “almost seven times” that of any previous incumbent governor going into reelection. Pillen finished 2024 with more than $3 million in cash on hand, according to state campaign finance reports.
Dona-Gene Barton, a political science professor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln who studies political behavior, said, “This massive war chest creates a David vs. Goliath situation for potential challengers.”

Herbster and his team declined to comment. He and Pillen combined in 2022 for the most expensive gubernatorial primary contest and governor’s race in state history, with both raising and spending more than $11 million. 
Herbster lost to Pillen in that 2022 GOP primary, finishing second in a three-way race that also included then-State Sen. Brett Lindstrom of Omaha, who is running for the U.S. House in the Omaha-based 2nd District. 
Pillen then cruised to a general election victory against then-Democratic State Sen. Carol Blood of Bellevue. If a GOP primary rematch happens, Herbster will have to run without Trump’s endorsement this time, which he had in 2022.
Trump backing Pillen is a dramatic change from the last time Herbster faced the former University of Nebraska regent in a GOP-led state where Republicans hold a 2-to-1 voter registration advantage.
Herbster is expected to decide whether to run as early as this month. He continued his social media attacks on Pillen last week, saying Pillen is “running the state into the ground,” referring to the state budget shortfall. 
Currently, Jacy Todd and Sheila Korth-Focken, who announced late Monday, are the other two GOP candidates for governor. They haven’t yet filed fundraising tallies with the Nebraska Accountability and Disclosure Commission, which are required after candidates raise more than $5,000.
On the Democratic side, former state Sen. Lynne Walz is exploring a bid for governor. Walz spokesman Brandon Bayer said Pillen’s fundraising totals would have no impact on her decision to run. 
The GOP primary for governor is May 12. The general election is Nov. 3.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-07 15:40:10+00:00,CT Mirror,Latin Americans in CT have mixed emotions about Maduro’s capture,Eddy Martinez | Connecticut Public and Daniela Doncel | Connecticut Public,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/07/latin-americans-in-ct-have-mixed-emotions-about-maduros-capture/,"In CT's small Venezuelan American community, some are cautiously optimistic about the U.S. apprehension of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro.","Some members of Connecticut’s small Venezuelan American community are cautiously optimistic about the U.S. military’s apprehension of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro.
Norwalk resident Fabian Durango, originally from Caracas, the capital of Venezuela, said he’s relieved Maduro has been removed from power.
“This was long overdue, glad it was done,” Durango said. “I’m glad it was done clean and swiftly.”
Durango, who emigrated from Venezuela with his parents at the age of 10, has not been to the country in years. He said he has multiple family members in Caracas, several of whom saw low-flying aircraft as Saturday’s raid unfolded. Durango said his family left the country during a period of civil strife in 1990, years before Maduro’s predecessor, Hugo Chavez, won a presidential election.
Now Durango hopes Venezuela, which suffers from a faltering economy as a result of international sanctions and government mismanagement, can chart a new course. He remains optimistic despite his concerns over the U.S. government’s intentions, which President Donald Trump openly said was about regaining access to the country’s vast oil reserves.
“Our president is an aggressive businessman … they’re neither good or bad, but they prey on the weak … and I do worry that this is just going to be a rush for natural resources and minerals,” Durango said.
Clodomiro Falcón, president of Asoven CT, the Association of Venezuelans in Connecticut, said he’s optimistic. Falcón noted his opinions were not the official position of Asoven.
“I am very hopeful, but I understand at the same time taking Maduro away is part of a process that is very complex, a process that is not overnight,” Falcón said.
Falcón entered the United States in 1986, to pursue higher education. He said he did not leave Venezuela due to economic or political reasons, but ended up staying in the United States after he completed his education.
But Falcón kept close ties with family in the country, traveling regularly to visit until 2016, and cited his passport expiring at the time, and later, travel advisories to the country preventing him from returning.
“There is a lot of narrative, a lot of lies in Venezuela, in the narrative from the regime saying that Venezuela was at peace, that Venezuela was perfect, was heaven, that’s all lies,” Falcón said.
Venezuela’s economic troubles, according to previous reporting from NPR, turned many into refugees, fleeing soaring inflation in recent years, and violent political repression as the economy suffered from growing income inequality. Some of those refugees entered the United States in recent years, facing xenophobia due to alleged connections with organized crime and drug trafficking, although the New York Times contested those connections in its reporting.
While many Venezuelan refugees are not criminals, Falcon said his homeland is governed by them, and took issue with demonstrations criticizing American involvement in Venezuela.
“I think these people don’t understand that they are not attacking Venezuela,” Falcón said. “This is attacking a criminal organization.”
Falcón hopes he can travel to the country, provided the Maduro government is completely removed from power.
“I pray to the Lord that I am alive, and healthy to be able to see Venezuela again,” Falcón said.
Mixed emotions beyond Venezuela
Trump has alluded to the possibility of more U.S. military action against other Latin American countries, including Mexico and Colombia.
The implications have left Colombian American Amy Carmona feeling uncertain about what the future may hold for her family in Medellín, the Colombian “City of Eternal Spring.”
Carmona is a sophomore at the University of Connecticut and the PR Chair of PorColombia, UConn’s Colombian Student Association.
“Obviously, [Colombian President Gustavo] Petro has a very unfortunate reign over the country right now, but I think that it’s super unethical to go about and do the same thing,” Carmona said.
She said she can’t overlook the repercussions that may come to Venezuela after the extraction, comparing the situation to the lack of structure and stability in Iraq after Saddam Hussein.
Carmona said she also can’t ignore the Trump Administration’s intentions with Venezuela’s oil. U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy has pointed to that as well, stating that the operation on Venezuela is about “enriching Trump’s oil industry backers.”
Carmona’s biggest worry, however, is the lack of concern for the situation among her family and other Colombians.
She was in Medellín during the operation on Saturday, visiting family for the holidays. As she watched the story of Maduro’s removal unfold on social media, Carmona said her family was celebrating.
“My family is very happy. They’re rejoicing about it. I haven’t really heard any critics say anything. It’s mainly just people from the United States that have seen this before with other invasions of countries, but obviously a third world country is going to be appreciative of the fact that prices would go down, or there’s opportunity for another leader,” Carmona said.
Petro’s response to Trump, in which he warns Trump that he will retaliate should Trump attack, also has Carmona feeling like Colombians aren’t really worried about a strike from the U.S.
“I feel like people aren’t really taking it as seriously as it is, mainly because I don’t think people know about the implications,” Carmona said.
Those implications being what could happen to Colombia if Petro is taken the same way Maduro was.
“I’m unsure if the country would go into the right hands in this situation, because the Guerrilla presence is so strong here. I think that it could honestly go either way,” she said.
Reports have come out that the National Liberation Army (ELN), a left-wing rebel group in Colombia, is preparing for a possible military intervention from the U.S.
The idea already has Carmona feeling jumpy.
“Honestly, [Sunday] night, I can tell you that I heard a loud noise. I was like, ‘Oh my God. This is it?’” Carmona said.
Carmona is encouraging others who share the same fears to stay informed and keep the faith.
“Having faith right now in such a troubling time is so important, because if you don’t believe in something, you can very easily be steered in the wrong direction,” Carmona said.

Students of all ages are putting in the effort to bring their goals to fruition. Education continues to shape pathways for learners at every stage, and 2026 brings new possibilities for learning of all kinds. The stories revisited below highlight seven student experiences.
Full-time firefighting is in Bailey’s future
Bailey Shepard’s goal grew from the sense of belonging he felt the minute he put on a firefighter’s helmet as a child. As he matured, he knew he would turn his volunteer service into a full-time career as a firefighter and EMT. “I’d love to do it full time. I’m just waiting for a job to open up somewhere,” he says. 
In high school, Bailey attended a student leadership retreat organized by VSAC. It turned out to be a transformative experience, giving him the skills he needed to cement his lifelong commitment to helping others. He joined a volunteer fire department as soon as he turned 16 and attributes his dedication to the guidance and leadership experience he gained from his VSAC program. “A big part of the job is taking charge in emergency response situations. I use those leadership skills I built with VSAC almost every day,” he shared.
As he looks to his future, Bailey is determined to continue making a difference for others. 
OJ Dreams of Hollywood or opening his own business
OJ Daring is open to where his path will take him, including Hollywood. A senior at Champlain College, OJ says, “I have a lot of different ideas. Hollywood has always been the dream, but I could also see myself going the niche route—working in marketing for a company or starting a business of my own. Most important is being able to support myself,” he says.  
OJ is studying film and finance. He goes deeply into editing videos and working on a variety of film projects. An alumni of VSAC’s GEAR UP college and career readiness program, OJ says the support he received getting into and getting started at Champlain made all the difference. “The process was smooth for me because of VSAC. If I didn’t have that, I would have had a harder time. They helped me through the confusion, answered my questions, and made me feel confident.”
He’s finishing his senior year this semester. As to whether his path will take him to Hollywood, to owning his own business, working in marketing, or something else? Only time will tell. Either way, OJ is excited for a bright future. 
On the farm or in the field is where Hailey wants to be 
Hailey Bartlett is certain about one thing: she’s not interested in a desk job. Instead, she’s preparing for a hands-on career working with animals—as a veterinarian, veterinary technician, or animal nutritionist. What matters most to her is being directly involved with animal care and putting her animal science studies to practical use.
Hailey is currently in her first year at SUNY Cobleskill. She grew up around agriculture, showing animals through 4-H and spending much of her time with animal companions. During some of the most challenging periods of her high school years, working with animals—especially calves—became a positive and grounding outlet. She applied to college as an independent student and relied on VSAC for guidance in navigating the financial aid process, including completing the FAFSA and applying for scholarships.
Her experiences with animals and farm life have helped clarify the path she wants to pursue. Hailey’s journey is an exciting one, shaped by her interests.
Maria is building an engineering career, one proton at a time
Maria Tye first heard the words “chemical engineering” in high school, after excelling in chemistry and being encouraged to explore the field. She knew she wanted a stable future and set out to make it happen, despite challenges at home and financial hurdles. Maria spent hours researching colleges, completing applications, and applying for scholarships and grants. She balanced schoolwork with track, summer jobs in manufacturing, and internships, gaining hands-on experience while building the skills needed for her career.
When financial barriers threatened to derail her plans, she sought creative solutions, relying on family and mentors to help with loans. College demanded persistence, teamwork, and self-advocacy, and Maria leaned on peers and support systems to navigate a rigorous program and personal challenges.
Today, as a project engineer at Amphenol Aerospace, she bridges disciplines and works on innovative projects—proof that dedication, resourcefulness, and hard work can turn aspirations into reality.
Ailyn is headed toward the ocean
Ailyn Langley is confident her future lies with the ocean. “It’s fascinating and beautiful and I want to be able to look deeper into it,” she shares. 
A first-generation student, she’s in her first year at Dartmouth College where she’s focusing on marine biology and neuroscience. She grew up in West Fairlee and always gravitated toward nature and especially the world underwater. “Many parts of the ocean are misunderstood,” she says. Ailyn is determined to explore those things and has set great goals for herself in life and for her time at Dartmouth, including learning how to dive. 
She’s well on the way to achieving her dreams, one class at a time. 
Amara and Nick share roots, but have different goals
Twins Amara Chester and Nick Armstrong grew up in Pownal. Encouraged by their mother to explore beyond their hometown, both understood early that education could open doors—but reaching their goals required effort.
Amara discovered her passion for speech pathology through a high school human services class and a career skills assessment. She researched colleges, applied widely, and spent hours completing scholarship applications and financial aid forms to make attending Biola University in California possible. Today, she works in cognitive therapy, helping individuals recover from brain injuries while balancing life as a new mom.
Nick explored multiple interests before finding real estate through a college internship and hands-on home renovation experience. He carefully weighed schools, navigated applications and financial aid, and now works as a broker, manages investment properties, and plans to expand his business.
Amara and Nick’s dedication shows that ambition, hard work, and the right support can turn goals into reality.

(Photo by Michele Jokinen/House Public Information Services)In the latest blow to Minnesota’s once vaunted reputation for good governance, the Office of the Legislative Auditor has identified “continued and pervasive concerns” with grant-making practices at the Behavioral Health Administration, an arm of the Department of Human Services that assists people who struggle with substance abuse and mental health.
Appearing before a panel of lawmakers on Tuesday, Legislative Auditor Judy Randall outlined the findings of her office’s partial review of approximately $192 million of grants issued to 590 non-governmental entities between 2022 and 2024.
During the course of the investigation, she said, auditors “identified a number of documents that the Behavioral Health Administration either backdated or created after our audit began in response to our request for information.”
“Frankly, in the 27 years I’ve been with the OLA, we’ve never seen this before,” Randall said. “It’s very troubling. It wasn’t just one individual that created or backdated the documents. We do believe it was a systemic effort.”
Randall said such practices raise questions about the validity of the information provided by the agency, thus “undermining the integrity of the audit.”
Shireen Gandhi, acting commissioner of the DHS, told lawmakers on the Legislative Audit Commission that she was “shocked to hear this information.”
“It is absolutely unacceptable that any staff would provide anything other than accurate information of the work done to the auditor,” Gandhi said.
The audit identified other worrisome issues with the BHA’s grant-making practices, including a widespread and improper reliance on non-competitive “single source” bids; poor oversight of grantees; failure to conduct site visits; and lax documentation.
The most eye-catching detail in the report is suggestive of outright graft.
According to the audit, one unnamed grant manager with BHA approved a payment of $672,647 to a new vendor for a single month’s work, then left state employment a few days later. That grant manager subsequently provided consulting services to the provider.
“We asked BHA management whether they questioned such a large reimbursement request for just one month of work.  BHA management said that due to limited information in the grant management system and the grant manager no longer being available, they could not answer this question,” the report states.
When auditors contacted two subcontractors of the aforementioned provider, the report continues, neither subcontractor was able to “provide sufficient documentation regarding who they served with the money they received from the grantee.”
One subcontractor told auditors that the grantee “told them they did not need to keep detailed participant records, such as sign-up sheets.” Absent such documentation, the report states, auditors “could not determine whether subcontractors provided the services for which they were paid.”
Lawmakers reacted to the findings with disbelief.
“I’m floored. This is incredible,” said Rep. Patti Anderson, R-Dellwood, who noted that “half the grants had some sort of backdating or falsification of the documents.”
 “It wasn’t just one or two people. It was a big chunk of the staff. Someone must have told them to do that. Who told the staff to do that?” Anderson asked.
Gandhi responded that “if someone directed staff to falsify documents, it’s absolutely wrong.”
“It’s an HR matter for sure, it may be more than that,” Gandhi said.
In response to lawmakers’ queries about whether any of the issues identified in the report constituted criminal fraud, Gandhi said one internal audit conducted by DHS has been referred to law enforcement, but she provided no more details. 
While Republicans on the committee were harsher in their assessment of the agency’s failures, calls for reforms were bipartisan.
Sen. Ann Rest, DFL-New Hope, the committee chair, said she expected there will be a change in law that will mandate “a cooling off period” for former department employees before they can be hired by grant recipients. 
For her part, Gandhi told lawmakers that the agency was working to improve training for grant managers and increase oversight. 
“I take the report seriously,” she said. “Strong internal controls are essential to protect taxpayers’ funds.”

With the agency, more commonly referred to as EGLE, overseeing issues like environmental contamination, clean water, and working alongside several partners to protect the Great Lakes and the species that call them home, its year end report for 2025 and its State of the Great Lakes report point to accomplishments like the delisting of Muskegon Lake as a Great Lakes Area of Concern while detailing its continued efforts in fighting algal blooms in Lake Erie, among other issues.
While there are more than 27,000 environmentally contaminated sites across the state, EGLE reported increased cleanup efforts, with the department working on 940 sites in 2025 compared to 870 in 2024. EGLE also addressed a larger number of leaking underground storage tanks, closing 561 sites in the 2025 fiscal year compared to 409 the year prior.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Since 2020, EGLE has tripled the amount of storage tank leaks it addresses in a given year, agency director Phil Roos told Michigan Advance in an interview Tuesday.
The department has also plugged 292 of the 570 orphan wells in the state, sites used for oil, gas or brine disposal that were not closed properly and where the owner is either insolvent or cannot be identified.
The state also continued to identify sites contaminated by per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, man-made chemicals used in fire fighting foam, nonstick cookware and a number of other products that have been tied to negative health impacts including increased risks for multiple types of cancer.
In 2026, the Michigan PFAS Action Response Team – established in 2017 by seven state agencies including the Department of Environmental Quality, EGLE’s predecessor – will award and administer grants to airports where firefighting foam has contaminated groundwater and surface water. The grants will be used for testing, studying best ways to address contamination, and cleaning out fire trucks to use newer firefighting foam.

EGLE has also taken steps to prevent the chemicals from being discharged into Michigan waterways with the department’s industrial pretreatment programs producing a 59% reduction of PFOS – a type of PFAS – on average and 99% reduction at some locations.
In addition to addressing PFAS, the department has also leveraged one-time funding from the Legislature to research microplastics in waters throughout the state. While the health impacts of these small pieces of plastic are still being researched, microplastics have been found throughout the human body and are suspected to harm reproductive, digestive and respiratory health. 
The three EGLE departments overseeing microplastics research are focused on four main areas: establishing a better understanding of concentrations of microplastics in surface waters; improving understanding of microplastics in public drinking water supplies; identifying critical areas for future microplastics research; and developing a comprehensive statewide microplastics strategy beginning in 2026.
“I think it’s going to be really eye opening, and give us clarity at least about where to start, where the problem’s the biggest, what do we need to focus on,” Roos said. “It’s similar to the early days of PFAS, you know. There we had communities that were being directly impacted with significant health impacts and water contamination. Here, it’s been sort of a silent issue that we’re all concerned about.”
The state is also playing a part in addressing harmful algal blooms in the Western Lake Erie Basin, with EGLE working alongside the Michigan Department of Natural Resources and the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development to reduce the flow of nutrients that cause algal blooms from farmland into the basin over the next five years. 
In addition to its work on pollution and environmental quality, EGLE is also working alongside partners from state and federal agencies and tribal governments on species management, including efforts to address threats to whitefish populations, protect the endangered piping plover and keep invasive sea lampreys in check.
The Michigan Wild Rice Initiative – which is composed of the 12 federally recognized Anishinaabe Nations that share geography with Michigan, and several state agencies including EGLE – also released a stewardship guide on manoomin, or wild rice. The guide tells the story of manoomin from an Anishinaabe perspective centered on building a relationship with the grain as a central part of restoration and revitalization efforts. 
“I cannot stress the importance of that resource for our friends in the tribal communities in the state. Literally, it’s such a central point of their culture and also their livelihood,” Roos said.

Moving into this year, Roos said drinking water will continue to be a main priority for EGLE, especially the state’s efforts to replace lead water lines. 
“I think we’re going to have access to a bit more money in terms of lead service line replacement money this year,” Roos said. “And the reason is that we met a requirement a lot of other states didn’t necessarily meet, which is we were the first state to achieve a statewide inventory of lead service lines.”
The department will also remain focused on making progress on contaminated sites, Roos said, with plans to improve how it staffs sites and how it categorizes the environmental risk at each site.
Another piece of that effort is EGLE’s brownfield redevelopment program, which cleans up contaminated sites so they can be used for housing, business and community needs like parks or recreation centers. 
“We’re going to try to step that up another level in the next year,” Roos said. “We have legislation Rep. [Alabas] Farhat (D-Dearborn) has sponsored which would remove some of the red tape and give us more flexibility in what sites we can use the Brownfield program for.”
Under the current system, grants and loans for each site are capped at $1 million, which Roos said has limited the sites they are able to redevelop. One of the changes within Farhat’s legislation would double that cap to $2 million, marking the first increase since the program began in 1998. 
Building on previous efforts, Roos said the department will also be placing an increased focus on storm water management and dam safety. 
There are a number of dams throughout the state that are in bad shape, Roos said, some of which have owners who have not invested in necessary maintenance and some that have either outlived or are approaching the end of their useful lives.
“You’re going to see a lot of efforts for us to get out in front of that,” Roos said “We’ve had a very successful dam safety fund that we’re just about out of money on. We’re going to hope to get a little help from the Legislature on that.”

The department will also continue to focus on clean and affordable energy Roos said, noting that it will be expanding its home energy rebate program, which provides funding to address the upfront costs of energy efficiency upgrades like insulation, air sealing and heating and cooling, as well as the purchase of electrical appliances, wiring upgrades or buying a heat pump for heating and cooling their household.
Roos also pointed to EGLE’s Renewables Ready Communities program, which provides funding to communities that adopt large-scale solar energy, wind or battery storage. 
While Michigan Attorney General is pursuing a lawsuit against President Donald Trump’s administration over the decision to revoke funding for the Solar For All Program, Roos noted that Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s MI Healthy Climate Plan, which set Michigan’s goal of reaching 100% carbon neutrality by 2050 predates the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which brought an influx of funding and incentives to support the transition to clean energy, including the Solar For All program.

Although EGLE plans to “fight like hell” to get its Solar For All funding back, Roos said, there are other funding mechanisms for programs like Renewables Ready Communities that will help the state to reach its clean energy and climate goals. 
Between a 40% pause in its funding as a result of the Trump Administration’s attempted pause on federal grants and loans, and modest cuts to its budget, EGLE has weathered a lot in the past year, Roos said. Despite those challenges, Roos said he’s proud and thankful the department has been able to continue to provide its core functions alongside meeting its commitments.
However, further cuts could begin to threaten EGLE’s ability to deliver on protections for the residents of Michigan, Roos said.
“Despite everything we’re on our feet, we’re living our mission,” Roos said. “We’re doing everything we can to protect everybody in the state according to what we can under the law. But there’s not a lot of room to mess around here.”

(Getty Images)In the middle of December, a “grateful” John Sununu shared a list of new endorsers for his U.S. Senate campaign, through which he plans to “bring New Hampshire common-sense” to Washington.
Among those new supporters, as the memo’s headline trumpets, is New Hampshire House Majority Leader Jason Osborne.
Despite the Sununu family’s persistent desire to be embraced as moderate conservatives in this immoderate age, and Osborne’s entrenched position in the far right of the state’s Republican Party, the two aren’t exactly strange bedfellows. With Osborne’s endorsement, Sununu will receive a necessary primary bump with New Hampshire right-wingers and, in return, Osborne gets to dip a toe in the mainstream and gain a direct line of communication to a potential U.S. senator. Maybe the fringe, anti-government, Free State Project philosophy of a transplant from Defiance, Ohio, is what passes as “New Hampshire common-sense” these days. 
Ain’t politics grand?
A review of Osborne’s sponsored bills for 2026 sheds some light on his political commonality with former Gov. Chris Sununu’s big brother. The House majority leader would love to see, for example, another rate reduction for the business enterprise tax and the repeal of the communications services tax. I suspect Sununu would be on board with both bills if he had his sights set on the State House rather than the Capitol. And because of the overall Republican fervor for any and all methods of dismantling public education, it’s not hard to imagine Sununu nodding his approval of Osborne’s efforts to “establish a local education freedom account program,” launch a study committee for “transitioning all public schools to public charter schools,” and create a system of open enrollment that would almost certainly close countless community schools in property-poor districts.
But what about some of Osborne’s other pieces of proposed legislation, such as his jingoistic outline for how teachers should be directed to talk about inequality, race, and sexuality, or a bill to repeal the refugee resettlement program? Or how about Osborne’s use of racial slurs and his general callousness?
It almost certainly doesn’t matter to Republican voters. To be a modern Republican is to declare that there is very little you won’t endorse, whether through applause or silence, to accomplish whatever it was that made you a conservative to begin with.
What’s a little violent persecution of certain immigrant populations, based on skin color, if it means the furtherance of “school choice”? 
What’s a bit of brazen profiteering by the nation’s First Family if it means tax breaks for corporations and the wealthiest Americans?
What does a clear violation of foreign sovereignty, and another plunge into the morass of nation-building, matter if it means cheaper fossil fuels in the short term for Americans?
Around the same time Sununu sent out his memo of new endorsements, I received an email from a reader who disagreed with something I had written about the state’s approach to taxation. It was a critical but cordial letter, but in a follow-up the writer reprimanded me in a way that has been sloshing around in my brain ever since: “I would prefer that you refer to Republican Leadership rather than Republicans,” he wrote. “There is a difference. Not all Republicans agree with the Leadership.”
That Republican voters would consider politicians that they elected to serve and lead to be somehow disconnected from their own political desires is remarkable to me. It’s one thing if a politician pulled a 180 after an election, in which case the voter is a victim of fraud, with restitution to be paid in the form of an election defeat the next time around. But nothing that’s happening now at the hands of Republican majorities is a surprise, here in Concord or in Washington. The administrations in power never missed an opportunity on the trail to articulate just how black and white they viewed the world, nor did they underplay the inhuman lengths to which they would go to prosecute and punish the people they consider unworthy of an American existence.
The slowly unraveling narrator of Ralph Ellison’s “Invisible Man” asks, amid his deep disillusionment in a postwar America incapable of bridging its violent divisions, whether politics could ever be “an expression of love.” I’m not sure how readers answered that question in 1952, but here in 2026 a “hell no” echoes through policy after policy drafted by a ruling party that is fully committed to broadly inflicting love’s opposite.
I get the sense from Republicans like Sununu and my letter writer that many in the party still see the president as some kind of an outlier, a useful but impermanent disfigurement of the party’s core principles. But this president’s role isn’t as some kind of singular architect but rather as a performer who effectively channels the many currents that electrify his party. That job is a walk in the park for a man who desires power above all else and pays no mind to the means by which that power is acquired, secured, and exercised. To believe that Republican leaders will return to some level of restraint once he’s gone is to disregard the historic allure of unfettered control of political levers. 
Do the moderate Republicans and right-leaning independents who are quietly riding out the present darkness (while privately celebrating any ideological victories that darkness has delivered) really believe that things will eventually snap back to some kind of more palatable centrism? Do they think the president’s personal ambition is somehow unique, that others aren’t lined up to grasp the same reins in exactly the same manner the very second this president releases them, by fate or by force?
Or maybe I’m overthinking it and the key to living as a modern old-school Republican in these cold days is just to pocket what you can while disavowing the sins of the motley coalition it took to get it. And then maybe a small prayer, of fluctuating urgency, that the genie will put itself back in the bottle before things go too far.
If that’s the case, I’m afraid I have some bad news.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/modernGOP-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-07 09:57:43.167042

(Photo on left by WEWS, photo on right provided.)David Pepper, the former chair of the Ohio Democrats, has been tapped as Dr. Amy Acton’s running mate in the 2026 governor race.
Pepper, an attorney from Cincinnati, Ohio, was predicted by both Democratic and Republican strategists as Acton’s running mate.
“I am proud to select David Pepper as my Lieutenant Governor. We both share a lifelong commitment to fighting for Ohio’s working families and making our state a more affordable place to live for all of us. David is an innovative and pragmatic leader who has been laser-focused on delivering for Ohioans for his entire career, from reducing the property tax rate for Cincinnatians to tackling foreclosures during the 2008 recession,” Acton said in a statement.
“I am thrilled to have David by my side in the fight to lower costs, tackle corruption and special interests, and ensure that every Ohio family can thrive and enjoy the quality of life we all deserve.”
Pepper, 54, has been supporting Acton, 59, for years. In our coverage of her campaign, Pepper has been the Democratic strategist cheering her on.
“Someone starting from no political background in such a short amount of time built such a massive base that only grows,” Pepper said back in July.
He also defended Acton’s work during the pandemic back in 2020.
Pepper served on the Cincinnati City Council and Hamilton County Board of Commissioners for years.
While on the Commission, he helped cut spending by $60 million, according to the campaign. He introduced a prescription drug discount program for Hamilton County, helped create a foreclosure prevention program and led an earned income tax credit initiative.
During his tenure on Council, he focused on affordability and public safety.
“I am honored and humbled to be joining Amy’s ticket and partnering with her in the fight to deliver for Ohio’s working families. Amy is the only candidate in this race who will tackle our affordability crisis and work to lower costs, tackle corruption, and invest in our public schools, so we can finally put working families first, not billionaires or special interests,” Pepper said in a statement.
“While our opponent is flying around our state in his private jet and moving his business from Cincinnati to Texas, we’re working to tackle the affordability crisis and create an Ohio where we can all get ahead.”
Pepper is a well-known name in Ohio politics, and one of the reasons is his outspoken nature. His X account boasts nearly 110,000 followers. He has also written several books about democracy.
He has been called by other strategists an essential political donor to Democratic causes.
“Ohio families are struggling to make ends meet, and Amy and David are the right choice to take on lowering costs, tackle the rampant corruption and special interests in our state and ensure that every Ohio family can thrive. The Acton campaign is the only choice in this race to fight for Ohio and put our state first,” Ted Strickland, Ohio’s former governor, said.
Pepper’s background
After growing up in Southwest Ohio, he graduated from Yale University and went to Yale Law School.
Pepper and his wife live in Cincinnati with their two children.

Chynah Tyler of Boston misspent campaign funds on personal uses such as Uber Eats orders, and failed to document details behind about $4,500 in other spending.","THE STATE’S CAMPAIGN FINANCE laws are notoriously generous when it comes to the kinds of things politicians can spend money on from their campaign accounts. They can use donations to their campaign on anything that furthers their political interests, a mile-wide definition that has seen state regulators give the green light to expenditures on everything from pricey steak dinners with colleagues to suites at the Beanpot college hockey tournament.
Despite rules that stretch allowable spending to include sometimes eyebrow-raising uses, Beacon Hill officials still seem to regularly manage to find themselves dinged by regulators for stepping beyond those limits.
The latest pol in the unwanted spotlight: state Rep. Chynah Tyler of Boston. Uber Eats, audiobooks, and thousands of dollars in unexplained spending have landed the Roxbury pol in hot water with state political finance regulators.
The Office of Campaign and Political Finance alleged that Tyler misused money from her campaign account for personal expenses in violation of state law, plus ran afoul of other reporting deadlines and record-keeping requirements.
Under the terms of an agreement made public Tuesday, Tyler will pay a $6,000 civil forfeiture to the state and to submit to greater campaign-finance scrutiny by OCPF for the next six months.
Regulators said Tyler made more than $800 in personal expenses “in error” from her campaign account between April 1 and October 20, which she repaid after OCPF inquired.
The office said Tyler’s team did not provide records to explain nearly $4,500 in additional expenses. State law presumes that any campaign spending without supporting documentation is made for personal use.
Tyler did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.
In an eight-paragraph statement included in the disposition agreement, Tyler said she gave birth in early 2025 — several months before the alleged personal spending from her campaign account — “and experienced limited mobility during that time, which impacted my ability to personally oversee certain campaign finance activities.”
On August 29, Tyler repaid her campaign committee $726 for personal expenses, and she repaid another $101 on November 2025.
While Tyler wrote in her OCPF statement that she reimbursed her campaign for personal spending “to ensure full compliance,” she did not provide any explanation of the $4,500 that regulators say was not properly documented.
Revised campaign finance reports now include multiple entries labeled “personal expense made in error,” such as a pair of Uber Eats orders, two separate $16.99 “recurring” charges for audiobook service Audible, and a $223 expense at Aicha’s African Hair Braiding in Dorchester.
Regulators dinged Tyler for several other reasons, too. They said her campaign failed to file reports in a timely manner detailing more than $13,000 in deposits between May 31, 2024 and June 28, 2024, which have since been submitted.
Tyler also allegedly received about $900 in combined contributions above the allowable limit from three people. While the campaign said it refunded the excess donations, OCPF wrote that Tyler’s camp did not submit any documentation to support that claim.
The five-term rep, who previously led the Legislature’s Black and Latino Legislative Caucus, owes $1,000 to the state immediately and will repay the remainder of the balance over a period of up to 10 months.
Tyler also agreed for her committee to provide OCPF with invoices, receipts, and other documentation covering all expenditures each month to undergo private regulatory review for six months.
It’s not the first time OCPF has chided Tyler for putting campaign dollars toward personal uses. In 2018, Tyler used $1,600 from her committee account as a “personal loan,” which she later repaid to her campaign.
Several lawmakers in recent years have triggered federal scrutiny through their spending habits. Former state rep David Nangle of Lowell served more than a year in prison after pleading guilty to charges that he used campaign funds on golf club memberships and casino bets.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Chynah-Tyler.png?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-07 09:57:43.167042

(Photo by Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Kansas House higher education budget committee didn’t wait for start of the 2026 legislative session to take a dive into millions of dollars in pending budget requests for public universities.
Rep. Adam Turk, a Shawnee Republican who chairs the committee, convened Republicans and Democrats during what he referred to as “zero week” rather than await start of the session Monday. The objective was to get a jumpstart on presentations and discussions about budget earmarks for Wichita State University, Kansas State University, University of Kansas, Fort Hays State University, Pittsburg State University and Emporia State University.
The Legislature’s interim budget committee previously rejected in late 2024 a series of proposals for university budget enhancements and hiring new campus personnel. In addition, that joint House and Senate budget committee said unused funding in current budgets could be seized and reappropriated in the new budget.
At this stage, administrators at the six state universities in Kansas began making sales pitches to the Republican-led House higher education budget committee for possible restoration of their requests.
“It is my intent to bring a quality product to the next level,” Turk said. “We can’t afford it to be unclear or indecisive or arbitrary in any way. I graduated from none of these institutions. I’ve got no dog in this hunt. You won’t see me playing favorites. Nothing is personal in here. It is math.”
Lawrence Rep. Mike Amyx, the ranking Democrat on the higher education committee, said he would focus on developing a budget plan that invested in delivery of a high-quality college education.
“Do everything we can to come out with the best budget,” Amyx said.
During the day’s committee meeting, PSU President Thomas Newsom, FHSU President Tia Mason and interim ESU President Taylor Kriley shared budget and enrollment information with legislators. They outlined arguments for legislative support of individual budget requests.
Comments from several lawmakers indicated the focus of the House committee would be on decreasing state government spending on higher education.
“I see a lot of expansion, new stuff,” said Turk, the chairman. “It’s real easy to build something new. Really hard … to find the things that are not working anymore, cut them off.”
Newsom, who started in September at PSU after leading Southeastern Oklahoma State University for five years, said higher education needed to do a better job of deleting weak programs as it went about directing resources into promising programs. He said regional public universities such as PSU had to concentrate on making efficient use of public and private funding as well as being responsive to student and industry demands.
“We tend to add new toys to the toy box a lot without getting rid of old toys,” Newsom said.
He said PSU’s goal was to attract 700 new students over the next five years, which could infuse $6 million in tuition revenue into the university.
Mason, who has served as president of FHSU since 2018, said the university had the lowest tuition and fee rate among public universities in Kansas. FHSU successfully launched affiliation agreements with North Central Kansas Technical College and Northwest Kansas Technical College to create better academic pathways for students, find operational efficiencies and better serve the region’s economy.
“We view ourselves as an engine for social mobility,” she said. “Proving that a premium education doesn’t have to come with a premium price tag.”
Mason was asked for enrollment and financial information about FHSU’s online degree programs with two universities in China. FHSU last fall enrolled 3,000 students from China in English, business, leadership and health studies programs. The international students generated about $9 million in annual revenue, she said, but net revenue runs about $5 million per year. The funds were plowed into the FHSU campus in Hays, she said.
Rep. Bill Rhiley, a Republican from Wellington, said influx of tuition dollars from international programs had successfully subsidized tuition rates for Kansans attending FHSU. Mason concurred with Rhiley, and called that revenue a “game changer” in terms of tuition affordability.
Mason said FHSU students in China were linked to an IT system based in Singapore. A cybersecurity firm was hired FHSU to improve online computer systems, she said. Participants in the China program didn’t engage in academic research that could be the subject of espionage, she said.
“They’re highly vetted and they’re very established partnerships,” Mason said. “The geopolitical environment has changed in 30 years. I appreciate the question.”
Turk said nobody on the House committee was questioning the commitment at FHSU to guarantee security of the program with China. He told Mason it was impossible to predict how international relationships could unfold years from now.
“I don’t mean to beat you up about this China thing,” he said. “The nature of my question is simply how to plan for the worst. We wouldn’t be doing our job if we weren’t projecting, as budget members, into the future.”
The House committee also heard budget presentations from representatives of the Behavioral Sciences Regulatory Board, Kansas State Board of Healing Arts, Kansas State Historical Society and Kansas State Library.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/thomas-Newsom-psu-3-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-07 09:57:43.167042

“I’m not a career politician; I come from a background of showing up early, working hard, and getting the job done,” Scott said, in a news release. “I’m running for the State Senate to make life better for retirees, families, and workers by keeping costs down, making sure people can access quality healthcare, and supporting the people who keep our communities running.”

(Photo provided by Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities)Future assessments of U.S. landslide hazards could include the study of risks posed by atmospheric rivers, which caused extreme precipitation that was linked to recent deadly slides in Southeast Alaska.
The added focus on atmospheric rivers is one of the main updates in a bill that would reauthorize the National Landslide Preparedness Act. The bill, sponsored by U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, passed the U.S. Senate on Monday and is now to be considered by the U.S. House.
The initial National Landslide Preparedness Act was signed into law five years ago. That bill broadened the National Landslide Hazards Program led by the U.S. Geological Survey and established a multiagency system to coordinate landslide preparedness and response.
Atmospheric rivers are long and transitory bands of moisture and heat, likened to rivers in the sky. They carry that moisture northward from more southern latitudes, and they can dump vast amounts of rain for several hours or even days.
“You can very rapidly saturate soils in the right conditions,” said Rick Thoman, a scientist with the Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Preparedness at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.
When such large amounts of warm southern moisture hit the steep mountainous regions of Southeast Alaska, they can cause sudden downhill flows, Thoman said.
“It’s really that intense amount of rain that atmospheric rivers deliver that’s the link to landslides,” he said.
Numerous landslides in the United States have been triggered by atmospheric rivers’ extreme precipitation. Those events include the 2023 slide in Wrangell that killed six people, the 2020 slide in Haines that killed two people and the 2015 slide in Sitka that killed three people.
The National Landslide Preparedness Act Reauthorization Act passed the Senate by unanimous consent. It is co-sponsored by U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Washington, whose state was the site of the 2014 Oso landslide that killed 43 people.
Extreme precipitation events from atmospheric rivers are tied to shallow-seated landslides such as the deadly events that struck Southeast Alaska in recent years. Other types of Alaska landslides are caused by more deep-seated slope failures triggered by glacial retreat, permafrost thaw or a combination of those forces.
Also passed on Monday by unanimous consent in the Senate was another Murkowski-sponsored and disaster-focused bill, the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program Reauthorization Act. That bill, co-sponsored by U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla, D-California, supports the federal program that maintains earthquake measurement resources and equipment and equipment and early warning systems.
“Earthquakes and landslides are active threats that have taken lives and damaged property across Alaska in recent years,” Murkowski said in a statement issued Tuesday. “Our passage of these bills puts us on track to ensure that federal agencies have the resources they need to help keep communities safe both back home and around the country. I thank my colleagues for working cooperatively to pass these measures and urge the House to take them up and send them to the President as soon as possible.”

One year ago today, the Palisades and Eaton wildfires erupted in Los Angeles County. Together they burned more than 58 square miles of land — destroying over 16,000 structures, displacing thousands of households and claiming at least 31 lives. As one of the costliest wildfires in history, the estimated economic losses caused by the blazes range from $65 billion to as much as $275 billion.
Most residents are still struggling to put their lives together: A survey by the nonprofit group Department of Angels found that about 90% of Pacific Palisades residents and 80% of Altadena residents remain displaced as of October. 
Survivors also continue to face frustrations with insurance companies — including delayed or denied claims — underscoring how California’s property insurance market remains rife with problems, writes CalMatters’ Levi Sumagaysay. 
Premiums are likely to rise for policyholders across the state, and customers of California’s two largest insurers, State Farm and the last-resort FAIR Plan, were the most dissatisfied with their insurers’ response, according to the Department of Angels.

Angela Giacchetti, a spokesperson for the nonprofit whose Altadena home was damaged by the Eaton Fire: “We’ve paid almost $200,000 out of pocket to repair our home because of the FAIR Plan’s blanket denials of our remediation.”

But there have been some wins. California passed a law last year requiring insurers to pay claims without first seeing detailed inventories from policyholders. On Tuesday Gov. Gavin Newsom also issued an executive order expanding price gouging protections for people recovering from the fires. 
Permits for new homes in the affected regions have also been issued at a relatively fast clip compared to historic state standards, reports CalMatters’ Ben Christopher. As of this week, more than 2,600 residential permits have been distributed — a rate that’s “three times faster” than the five years leading up to the fires, Newsom’s administration noted.

After being rushed to a Chico hospital the night before, U.S. Rep. Doug LaMalfa died on Tuesday at the age of 65. For more than a decade the Republican represented California’s 1st Congressional District, which stretches from the Oregon-California border through Shasta and Sutter counties, writes CalMatters’ Maya C. Miller.
LaMalfa died in emergency surgery after experiencing a “medical emergency” in his home, according to the Butte County Sheriff’s Office. Lamalfa was known as a pragmatic congressmember who was committed to issues affecting his rural Northern California district, including water access and forestry management.
His death narrows the GOP’s slim majority in the House, which now stands at 218. By state law, Gov. Newsom has 14 days to call a special election to fill the rest of LaMalfa’s term, which will take place under the existing district boundaries, rather than the new lines voters approved of through Proposition 50.

Limón starts as Pro Tem

Seven months after being elected Senate President Pro Tem in June, Democratic Sen. Monique Limón of Santa Barbara begins her tenure as leader of the California Senate — the first Latina ever to do so, reports Maya.
Backed by labor unions, the 46-year-old progressive’s career in the chamber includes successfully pushing legislation to make workers’ pay more transparent, shield medical debt from credit reports and require setbacks around new oil and gas wells. Prior to that, Limón was an Assemblymember for four years, and served on the board of trustees for the Santa Barbara Unified School District for six years.
As Senate Pro Tem, Limón faces the state’s $18 billion budget deficit and deep federal cuts under President Donald Trump. Though she did not disclose many details about how she’ll steer the caucus through budget talks, she told CalMatters that the caucus “will continue to prioritize issues that our communities prioritize.” She also declined to identify any specific legislative measures that the caucus would prioritize.

The nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office released a report Tuesday, examining whether the funding formula for California’s K-12 schools should switch from attendance to enrollment, which could bring billions of more dollars to schools. Read what the LAO recommends from CalMatters’ Carolyn Jones.






California Voices
CalMatters columnist Dan Walters: Critics of Newsom and California Democrats are making an iffy link between a state audit on fraud and a scandal in Minnesota, highlighting the amped-up rhetoric during an election year.
The California Department of Insurance is too lax regulating insurance companies’ behavior, yet too strict controlling their market access, writes Patrick Wolff, a Democrat who is running for insurance commissioner.
Local and state governments failed to lead within months of the L.A.-area fires, and candidates now running for various L.A. offices must present serious plans to address these failures, writes Max Lubin, CEO of Kismet Research.

,Mississippi Today,2026-01-07 13:39:56+00:00,Mississippi Today,83 witnesses could enter the ring in Mississippi welfare scandal trial,Anna Wolfe,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/07/83-witnesses-mississippi-welfare-scandal-trial/,The federal courthouse in Jackson,"Ten of roughly 80 potential jurors raised their hands in a downtown Jackson courtroom Tuesday when a federal judge asked: “How many professional wrestling fans do we have in here?”
Juror #4 stood and responded to U.S. District Court Judge Carlton Reeves, “You wanna ask my favorite or something?”
It was John Cena, a WWE star of the mid-2000s t0 2010s.
“You’re a youngster,” Reeves joked.
Others were fond of The Undertaker, The Spoiler, or Bruiser and Crusher – performers dating back to as early as the 60s. But nearly all called themselves “former” fans of the sport. They watched no longer. “Too bloody and too violent,” Juror #19 mused.
None of these answers were necessarily disqualifying since each of the participants vowed that their affinity – or lack thereof – for athletic theater would not affect their impartiality as a juror in the criminal trial of retired WWE wrestler Ted “Teddy” DiBiase Jr.
Jury selection in the trial began Tuesday morning and lasted until after 7 p.m. The federal government will begin presenting its case against DiBiase Wednesday morning. 
DiBiase is accused of conspiracy, wire fraud, theft concerning programs receiving federal funds and money laundering surrounding payments two nonprofits made to him in 2018 at the direction of the Mississippi Department of Human Services. 
The money he’s accused of taking came from two federal public assistance programs, including the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant.
The charges against DiBiase represent just a fraction of what is known as the Mississippi welfare scandal, in which auditors have questioned the spending of roughly $100 million in anti-poverty funds. But he is the only criminal defendant to challenge the government, insisting he was a lawful contractor. Seven others, including his brother Brett DiBiase, have pleaded guilty.
During the proceedings Tuesday, jurors were asked if they had heard anything about the welfare scandal in the news or on social media – around half said yes – or if they had read State Auditor Shad White’s supposed tell-all, “Mississippi Swindle,” about the case. None had.
“I heard about the book, but I care nothing about reading it,” Juror #66 said. “I don’t want to read anything he writes.”
But when Reeves asked if anyone in the courtroom believed everything TV stations or newspapers had to say about the scandal, the room went silent. Like with their WWE nostalgia, the jurors promised that any information they’d consumed previously would not sway their judgement.
Perhaps the most revelatory inquiry came when Reeves asked the jurors if they had a relationship with any of the potential witnesses in the case, reading out a list of a whopping 83 names.
The list predictably included characters with direct involvement in the financial transactions alleged in the indictment against DiBiase – such as the former welfare director John Davis or the directors of the two nonprofits that paid funds to the wrestler, Mississippi Community Education Center founder Nancy New and former Family Resource Center of North Mississippi director Christi Webb. Davis, New and Webb have pleaded guilty for their roles in the larger scheme to divert funding away from needy families. 
But the list of witnesses goes much further, reaching high up into state government, including both White, who first investigated and made initial arrests in the case, and former Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant. Bryant was Davis’ boss during the scandal. And Bryant appointed White to his position of state auditor.
From the Mississippi Department of Human Services, the witness list includes the agency’s top official, current director Bob Anderson, former director Chris Freeze, and roughly 20 cabinet or lower-ranking employees, such as former attorneys Jacob Black and William Garrig Shields, two former communications directors, and Davis’ old secretary. It includes members of the team that audited or investigated the scandal for the State Auditor’s Office, the lead FBI agent and a representative from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of Inspector General.
The list also features a director at the regional office of HHS’s Administration for Children and Families in Atlanta, the agency responsible for providing federal guidance to Mississippi about TANF. 
Potential witnesses include DiBiase’s inner circle – his wife, his brother, multiple business associates and fellow motivational speakers – but also a who’s who of local celebrities and entrepreneurs that had become entangled in the wider state-sanctioned welfare delivery model called Families First for Mississippi from 2016 to 2020. 
One seemingly tangential witness, retired star running back Marcus Dupree, for example, received payments from the two nonprofits through a foundation he created to provide “equestrian activities for underprivileged children.” The witness list did not include former NFL quarterback Brett Favre. 
The trial is expected to take up to three weeks, and not all of the listed figures may be called.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/07092145/courthouse_jackson.jpg,,,2026-01-07 08:57:39.374034

A tough budget year will test her ability to keep the caucus united while whittling its spending priorities.","In summary
New Senate President Pro Tem Monique Limón is the first Latina, first mother and only second woman to lead California’s upper legislative chamber. A tough budget year will test her ability to keep the caucus united while whittling its spending priorities.


As California legislators return to Sacramento and prepare to tackle a budget deficit, all eyes are on new Senate President Pro Tem Monique Limón of Santa Barbara and what tone she sets for her chamber.
Limón, 46, a progressive backed by labor unions and the first Latina to lead the Senate, will face arguably her greatest legislative challenge yet as she and her diverse caucus grapple with a daunting projected $18 billion state budget deficit and historic federal funding cuts from the Trump administration.
While Limón has yet to announce any cost-cutting strategies or impose any limits on lawmakers introducing bills that require new money, the scarcity of funds will likely force the new leader to focus on a few key priorities, a premise she resisted in a recent interview with CalMatters. 
“Our caucus will continue to prioritize issues that our communities prioritize,” Limón said, rattling off a laundry list of policy areas including access to health care, cost of living, education, housing affordability and child care. The new Senate leader also emphasized the importance of finding policy solutions that are “encompassing of our caucus — that reflect 58 counties, 483 cities.” 
But how she’ll do that, while keeping the budget under control, remains to be seen.
For Limón, who has developed a reputation as an egalitarian consensus builder who wants everyone to feel heard, whittling down those priorities will test her ability to say “no” as the caucus tries to both rein in spending and fund programs that help vulnerable Californians. 
She told reporters at the Capitol on Monday that she expects senators to understand that “spending big is not something that is within our means at this moment” and said she would reiterate that message at their first caucus meeting.
Colleagues past and present give her their vote of confidence to lead the chamber through a difficult budget year.
“She’s a good person to have in place when there’s a challenge,” said Kate Parker, who served alongside Limón on the Santa Barbara school board, including as president. “Obviously the budget is going to be horrendous, and she’s somebody that I would really trust to move the state forward in a really difficult time.”
From school board to Senate leader
Limón points to her nine-year tenure in the Legislature and relationships with legislative colleagues as the foundation for her inevitably tough conversations about how to prioritize a mountain of pressing issues.
The new Senate leader is best known for pursuing pay transparency legislation, consumer protections such as shielding medical debt from credit reports, and efforts to regulate the oil industry. She authored a 2022 law that requires setbacks around new oil and gas wells and steps to protect residents who live near old wells, and pushed for an unsuccessful 2021 bill to ban oil fracking. Gov. Gavin Newsom later ordered the ban.

In the Assembly she chaired the Banking and Finance committee and until recently led the Senate committee on natural resources and water. Under two former Senate leaders, Toni Atkins and Mike McGuire, Limón was second-in-command as majority leader for Senate Democrats and helped craft legislative strategy. 
Limón was elected pro tem in June after joining forces with supporters of Sen. Angelique Ashby, a Sacramento Democrat also seeking the role, to amass a majority of the caucus and shut down a competing bid from Sen. Lena Gonzalez of Long Beach. The power jockeying came amid a chaotic week as a federal standoff over immigration enforcement exploded in Los Angeles and the Legislature scrambled to finalize a budget. Limón has since named Ashby as her majority leader.
Prior to running for the Legislature, Limón served six years on the board of trustees for the Santa Barbara Unified School District, the public school system she attended before she immersed herself in public service and policy studies at UC Berkeley and later, graduated from Columbia University with a master’s degree in education. 
Her first election for public office came in 2009 when Limón ran for an open spot on the Santa Barbara school board. Former board president Kate Parker, who overlapped with Limón during the now-senator’s six-year tenure, said she had never heard of Limón before the election and was even a bit skeptical about her leadership ability. 
“It was kind of out of left field that she was running, and she didn’t have a kid in the district,” said Parker. “She seemed so young to me at the time. You know, I think she was probably like 30 or something. And I just wasn’t sure if she had the experience to be a strong leader in the district.”
But from their first meeting, Limón impressed Parker with her ability to listen to all sides and draw consensus from a group with a wide range of opinions. 
“She was really good at crafting productive compromise,” Parker said. “She had a policy of meeting with anybody that wanted to talk to her.”
Limón has been tight-lipped about how she’ll steer the caucus through budget negotiations. But Parker said Limón is no stranger to difficult spending discussions. Nearly every year they served together, the school board faced budget challenges. 
“Her guiding principle, in that context, was always putting the student first,” Parker said, adding that Limón always tried to keep funding cuts as far away from the classroom as possible.

“I imagine that at the state level, you’ll find that she has guiding principles as well that help with her decision-making process,” Parker said. “It’s not random, it’s not piece by piece. It’s systematic.”
Limón has yet to divulge precisely what those guiding principles will be for the Senate under her leadership. In an interview with CalMatters, she declined to identify any specific legislative measures that the caucus would prioritize. 
But she hasn’t ruled anything out, either. When asked specifically whether her caucus should consider raising taxes or cutting state services, Limón didn’t reject either idea, both considered politically radioactive options.
“Everything’s on the table until we choose, or make a decision that it shouldn’t be on the table,” Limón said. “But having a deliberative and thoughtful conversation about the options in front of us doesn’t mean that we necessarily move forward with all options. It just means that you consider them.”
No bad blood with McGuire
Limón’s reputation as a collaborator and consensus builder contrasts starkly with that of her predecessor, McGuire, who some members, staff and lobbyists have privately called a micromanager.
During last year’s eleventh-hour negotiations over reauthorizing the state’s cap-and-trade program, McGuire reportedly kept the Senate’s draft bill language under lock and key and refused to let members take copies with them to review with staff, instead requiring them to come in person to view the text and banning photos. Advocates said they felt iced out of discussions and had little to no opportunity to give input. 
“We are hopeful that this change in leadership means the beginning of a new and more transparent process,” said Asha Sharma, state policy manager for the Leadership Counsel for Justice and Accountability.
Frustrations boiled over in a September budget subcommittee hearing when lawmakers debated a budget bill that contained more than $85 million in earmarks for projects in McGuire’s northern coastal district. That power play prompted Democratic Napa Sen. Chris Cabaldon to quip in front of the whole committee, “There are more than just a handful of disadvantaged communities, plus the North Coast, in California.”
Limón has tried to tamp down any criticism of her predecessor.

“There was never a moment that this was a comparison of leadership,” Limón insisted. “At the end of the day, this is really about what the caucus wants, the direction the caucus wants to go, the experiences that the caucus feels are needed at this moment in time.”
Limón led the Senate’s working group on the reauthorization of the state’s cap and trade program, a fight at the heart of negotiations on a climate and energy policy deal that dragged out the final days of last year’s legislative session. 
Her greatest challenge, said Sen. John Laird, a Santa Cruz Democrat and fellow member of the working group who she has named as her budget chair, was bridging the gaps between members who wanted to maintain the existing cap-and-trade program largely as-is and the climate hawks, who wanted to ditch some of the concessions former Gov. Jerry Brown gave to polluting industries to win votes during the last reauthorization.
“That was a real test because that was like riding a f-ing bronco,” Laird said. “And yet she worked hard to hold the Senate together. She worked hard to understand what individuals really wanted. And a lot of what we desired was part of the final results because of her work.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/010625-Limon-Senate-Pro-Tem-MG-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-07 08:57:39.374034

While few victims of last year’s fires are back in their homes, that’s not unusual following natural disasters; permitting changes appear to be helping. 


In the days immediately after last January’s Los Angeles firestorm, state lawmakers and civic leaders promised to turbocharge the rebuilding effort. For California, where the permitting and construction of homes is infamously slow and costly, the scale of destruction stood as a singular challenge.
A year later, the charred homes, the melted appliances and the toxic ash have mostly been removed, the dirt beneath scraped and then carted away. Many of the residents whose houses were spared have returned. Permits for reconstruction have been filed, architects and contractors hired. Battles with insurance companies, utilities and banks persist, vacant lots and blackened trees abound, but look around and — here and there — you’ll find new construction.
As of this week, more than 2,600 residential permits have been issued between the Palisades and Altadena — roughly one for every five of the nearly 13,000 homes lost. Another 3,340 are under review.
For many displaced and traumatized homeowners, that represents an intolerably slow return to what was. But by historic standards, the Los Angeles recovery has been on the speedy side so far.
In a press release commemorating the first anniversary of the disaster, Gov. Gavin Newsom lauded the permitting figures as “historic.”
Last year local governments — the City and County of Los Angeles, as well as Malibu and Pasadena — issued permits for single-family homes and accessory dwelling units “three times faster” than they were in the five years leading up to the fire, the administration noted. 
Rebuilding after disaster is almost always a grueling, slow process. Of the more than 22,500 homes destroyed in five of California’s most destructive fires between 2017 and 2020, fewer than four-in-ten had been rebuilt by 2025, a Los Angeles Times analysis from late last summer found.
A year after major fires ripped through Maui, Paradise, Redding and the outskirts of Boulder, Colo., 2%, 3%, 15% and 30% of the destroyed homes, respectively, had been permitted for reconstruction, according to a separate Urban Institute analysis. 
 Based on the pace of permitting, Los Angeles’ reconstruction is on a relatively fast track. But freshly-pulled permits aren’t completed homes.
“People can pull permits, but you know, if they don’t have their costs sorted out — we’ve had folks abandon their plans,” said Devang Shah with Genesis Builders, which is selling pre-approved, fixed-priced rebuilds in Altadena. Using permits as a metric of progress may be premature, he said.
Some of the speedy progress that Los Angeles has seen may be due to  regulatory changes imposed by fiat in the aftermath of the fire. In early 2025, both Newsom and Mayor Karen Bass mandated speedier permitting of like-for-like rebuilds — construction that stuck to the rough dimensions and design specification of the home that was there before. Los Angeles county rolled out a self-certification building plan approval pilot program for certain simple projects. Newsom waived building code requirements intended to ease the cost of reconstruction.
“We’ve got planning approvals in three days that would have normally taken three months,” said Tim Vordtriede, an architect who also lost his home in Altadena. The county has “done a remarkable job at making things as efficient and streamlined as a bureaucratic entity can.”
In the weeks after the fire, Vordtriede co-founded the Altadena Collective, a network of designers and architects that provides discounted design services, permitting advice and contractor recommendations to local survivors. He and his co-founders Chris Driscoll and Chris Corbett have also launched a nonprofit called Collective OR that is meant to represent inexperienced and anxious homeowners in negotiations with builders and architects. 
“It’s impossible to say, ‘they were here by this date so we should also be there.’ The data set is just too variable.”Colette Curtis, recovery and economic development director, Paradise 
The pace of reconstruction may simply benefit from the fact that it’s taking place in Los Angeles County: A mammoth economic hub flush with financial resources and political connections.
“We have access to a really good supply chain, there’s a lot of capital, there’s a lot of infrastructure,“ said Ben Stapleton, director of U.S. Green Building Council California. 
That’s in contrast to a town like Paradise. 
Since the majority of homes were destroyed in the 2018 Camp Fire, fewer than one-in-five have since been rebuilt, said Colette Curtis, the Butte County town’s recovery and economic development director. 
She cautioned against comparing the pace of rebuilding efforts across communities struck by disaster.
“It’s impossible to say, ‘they were here by this date so we should also be there,’” she said. “The data set is just too variable.”
Paradise, a remote town with relatively low income, lacked the local services and philanthropic draw of places like Lahaina and the Palisades, she said. But lower land values and the fact that displaced homeowners haven’t had to compete with investors setting aside new units for tourist rentals was a net positive. 
Another thing that may give Los Angeles a leg up: It’s a region that’s also heavy on expertise. 
At around the same time that Vordtriede was setting up the Altadena Collective, nearby architect couple Cynthia Sigler and Alex Athenson launched the Foothill Catalog, a packet of ready-made architectural and structural plans that have been pre-approved by L.A. County. 
With roughly 15 projects either under construction or gearing up to break ground, Athenson said the pre-approval process can shave at least 10% off the total development cost of a custom single-family home.
That’s in part by trimming the approval process. But that’s also because prior to the fire, a “custom single-family home” in ALtadena was a luxury product. 
The local industry is “set up to serve that client who is building their dream home from scratch, with a very large if not unlimited budget,” said Athenson. Long-time homeowners displaced by fire, many of them on fixed incomes, represent a very different kind of buyer. 
As builders, designers and policymakers scramble to rebuild in faster, cheaper and more fire-resilient ways, they may stumble upon a solution that could be of use long after the last home is rebuilt in Altadena, he added.
“Ultimately, we’re providing a system for more efficient, affordable housing development,” said Athenson. “I’m excited about proving it in Altadena, and then seeing where it goes beyond.”
So far the county has approved more than two dozen of the catalog’s plans. Athenson said they are now discussing rolling out a similar batch for the Palisades with the City of Los Angeles.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/083025-Palisades-Fire-Rebuild-GETTY-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-07 08:57:39.374034

Despite billions in dollars of claims paid out, fires exposed problems in California’s beleaguered insurance market. All policyholders are likely to see premiums rise.


A year after the deadly Los Angeles County fires, California’s property insurance market remains problematic; survivors are suing insurers over delayed or denied claims; and most of the state’s policyholders are likely to see their premiums rise.
Seven in 10 L.A. fire survivors have yet to return home, some in part because of insurance claim delays, according to a new survey released this week by Department of Angels, a nonprofit group that was formed after the fires.
The survey also found that 4 in 10 insurance policyholders have experienced insurability issues, such as huge premium increases and dropped coverage, although state law mandates a one-year moratorium on insurers canceling or not renewing customers’ policies after the governor declares a state of emergency. Those with homes that did not burn down but are still standing are especially likely to have seen big increases in their premiums, according to the survey of 2,443 adults from Nov. 18 to Dec. 2, 2025.
Insurance premiums for everyone, not just fire survivors, were already expected to rise under new rules by Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara. The commissioner, under pressure to improve availability of insurance in the state, last January implemented a plan that aims for quicker rate reviews and allows insurers to use catastrophe modeling and reinsurance costs in setting their rates. The plan took effect just days before the L.A. fires.
Now the response to the fires could also lead to even higher insurance premiums across the board, said Amy Bach, executive director of consumer advocacy group United Policyholders. 
“I advocate for disaster survivors, but also for the entire community of policyholders,” Bach said. “For every ‘Eliminate the List’ bill, for every improvement we make to prevent post-disaster trauma around under-insurance, there’s a cost.” She said such actions will have ramifications for both insurance affordability and availability.
“Eliminate the List,” which Gov. Gavin Newsom signed into law last year, requires insurance companies to pay 60% of personal property coverage limits, up to $350,000, to policyholders who experience a total loss without requiring them to submit a detailed inventory for at least 100 days.
Still, Bach knows that such mandates are necessary to improve survivors’ experiences after a fire, and lawmakers are introducing new bills to address their concerns. Her own group released a survey in November, reporting policyholder complaints that included insurer communication delays, claims payment delays and being assigned multiple claims adjusters. 
The Department of Angels survey found that customers of State Farm and the last-resort FAIR Plan — the two largest insurers in California — were the most dissatisfied with their insurers’ response. California’s insurance department is investigating State Farm’s response to the fires, and has taken legal action against the FAIR Plan over its response as well, especially to smoke-damage claims. Those insurers, along with other companies, are also facing policyholder lawsuits. 
“Our customer feedback reflects a different experience than what is being reported,” said Tom Hartmann, a State Farm spokesperson, in an email. “We’re supporting more than 13,500 customers affected by the wildfires, more than any other carrier, and have already paid over $5 billion to help them recover.”

“We’ve paid almost $200,000 out of pocket to repair our home because of the FAIR Plan’s blanket denials of our remediation,” said Angela Giacchetti, a spokesperson for the Department of Angels who worked on the survey. She’s also a fire survivor whose Altadena home did not burn down but was badly damaged. 
“While we are unable to comment on individual policyholders’ claims, the California FAIR Plan does not direct where policyholders reside,” said Hilary McLean, a spokesperson for the plan. “The FAIR Plan evaluates every claim on its own merits and pays all covered claims up to the individual policy limits.”  
The FAIR Plan said in a press release this week that it has handled about 5,400 claims and paid almost $3.5 billion to policyholders. It also said it “has taken steps to enhance its ability to serve policyholders” by securing a line of credit and reinsurance, helped by a $750 million catastrophe bond made possible by a new law allowing the FAIR Plan to get bond financing through the California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank.
The American Property Casualty Insurance Association says insurance companies have paid $22.4 billion of the expected $40 billion in total claims from the L.A. fires. 
The Department of Angels survey also found 79% of survivors are facing financial hardships, with more Black, Asian and Latino survivors falling behind on their rent or mortgage payments. In addition, 40% of those surveyed said they were very dissatisfied with the local, state and federal response to their needs.
Newsom said Tuesday that he is working with state lawmakers, the banking industry and others on new loans for rebuilding, and that the state will expand eligibility for the CalAssist Mortgage Fund. The governor’s office did not respond to CalMatters’ questions about whether he plans to propose any aid for renters who survived the fires, and about what else he is doing to continue to press the federal government for long-term disaster funding.
“This report says exactly what we’ve been hearing,” said Michael Soller, spokesperson for the insurance department. “Wildfire survivors want action and they want results.” He said the issues in the survey are top priorities for the department, and among other things pointed to a task force on smoke damage that the department has convened.
A bill sponsored by Lara and introduced by newly appointed Senate Insurance Committee Chair Steve Padilla, the Democrat from San Diego, late Tuesday would require insurance companies to submit to the state their disaster-recovery plans related to handling claims; double penalties for violations of fair claims practices during an emergency; expand upfront claims payments; give policyholders status updates within five days whenever their adjuster is replaced; and more.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/021425_EatonFireMudslides_JAJ_CM_23.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-07 08:57:39.374034

Last January, immediately after the fires, there was a moment of optimism for the future of Los Angeles. Fire survivors, policymakers, philanthropists, CEOs and regular Angelenos came together to plan Los Angeles’ recovery. 
But today, 12 months later, the failed leadership of California politicians has set back recovery efforts. 
I am a born and raised Angeleno, and like so many others after the fires, I wanted to help. My career leading mission-driven work led me to connect with Evan Spiegel, founder of Snapchat, and Miguel Santana, president of the California Community Foundation. They launched the Department of Angels, a nonprofit that supports LA wildfire survivors, elevating their leadership in the recovery process. 
Today the group is one of many organizations dedicated to the recovery effort. But community-driven work can only accomplish so much. Recovery efforts for disasters of this scale require the government to lead. 
Signs of the government’s systemic failure to lead began emerging within months of the fires. Away from Los Angeles when the fires first ignited — on an international trip she had pledged not to take — Mayor Karen Bass began the recovery effort behind the 8-ball and has seemingly never recovered. She has openly feuded with critics of her performance, including the Palisades Fire recovery czar that she herself appointed. 
At the county level, the board of supervisors still has not fixed the county’s broken emergency notification system, a failure that likely contributed to many of the 19 deaths in the Eaton Fire.
And at the state level, Gov. Gavin Newsom jockeyed to be the central figure in the campaign for federal funding, but his rivalry with President Donald Trump has doomed the possibility of federal aid for Los Angeles. 
The consequences have been devastating for survivors. 
Today, more than 8 in 10 Altadena residents and 9 in 10 Palisades residents are still out of their homes. Thousands of houses that survived the flames remain unsafe or uninhabitable because of contamination. And only about 15% of the 10,000-plus destroyed homes have received rebuilding permits from LA city or county. 
In other words, a year later, the rebuilding process has barely begun.
Perhaps worst of all, no concrete steps have been taken to prevent future wildfires in the Los Angeles area, where conflagrations are all but guaranteed.  If nothing changes about the government’s approach, most survivors of January’s fires will never return to their neighborhoods, and future fires will claim even more lives, homes and businesses. 
Despite the gravity of these challenges, there are reasons for optimism. This year Californians have the opportunity to elect officials who can plot a better way forward, including a new governor and statewide insurance commissioner. 
In Los Angeles, we will have elections for county supervisors, City Council, Congress, mayor and more. 
What are candidates’ plans for fire recovery?
The myriad candidates in the running need to present serious plans to address the failures of the first year of recovery. They must communicate clear ideas to address environmental toxins that remain, failed emergency response systems, future wildfire prevention and the painfully slow pace of permitting and rebuilding — among many other related issues. 
Philanthropy can play a role, too, by organizing nonpartisan candidate forums for candidates to hear from survivors directly. In the first year of the fire recovery, LA’s robust institutional philanthropies tried to help elected leaders behind the scenes. Looking ahead, philanthropies would be better served backing the public accountability work necessary for politicians to deliver on their promises. 
The failures of the first year of wildfire recovery rests at the feet of politicians, but that does not mean that the many years of recovery work ahead are doomed. Survivors and regular Angelenos have the chance to hold elected officials accountable for their shortcomings and elect new ones who are up to the job. 
L.A. fire survivors deserve a new set of leaders who’ll have the courage to act and the solutions to rebuild Los Angeles.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/042325-Altadena-Recovery-MT-Getty-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C707&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-07 08:57:39.374034
,California,2026-01-07 13:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,This change could deliver billions of more dollars to California schools. Here’s the tradeoff,Carolyn Jones,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/k-12-education/2026/01/school-enrollment-california/,"By basing funding on enrollment, not attendance numbers, schools would lose the incentive to get students to show up every day, a new report finds.","In summary
By basing funding on enrollment, not attendance numbers, schools would lose the incentive to get students to show up every day, a new report finds.


For years, California schools have pushed to change the way the state pays for K-12 education: by basing funding on enrollment, instead of attendance. That’s the way 45 other states do it, and it would mean an extra $6 billion annually in school coffers.
But such a move might cause more harm than good in the long run, because linking funding to enrollment means schools have little incentive to lure students to class every day, according to a report released Tuesday by the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office. Without that incentive, attendance would drop, and students would suffer. 
If the Legislature wants to boost school funding, analysts argued, it should use the existing attendance-based model and funnel more money to schools with high numbers of low-income students, students in foster care and English learners.
When it comes to attendance, money talks, the report noted. For more than a century, California has funded schools based on average daily attendance – how many students show up every day. In the 1980s and ’90s, the state started to look at alternatives. A pilot study from that time period showed that attendance at high schools rose 5.4% and attendance at elementary schools rose 3.1% when those schools had a financial incentive to boost attendance. 
This is not the time to ease up on attendance matters, the report said. Although attendance has improved somewhat since campuses closed during the pandemic, it remains well below pre-COVID-19 levels. In 2019, nearly 96% of students showed up to school every day. The number dropped to about 90% during COVID-19, when most schools switched to remote learning, but still remains about 2 percentage points below its previous high. 
Attendance is tied to a host of student success measurements. Students with strong attendance tend to have higher test scores, higher levels of reading proficiency and higher graduation rates.
“It’s a thoughtful analysis that weighs the pros and cons,” said Hedy Chang, president of the nonprofit research and advocacy organization Attendance Works. “For some districts there might be benefits to a funding switch, but it also helps when districts have a concrete incentive for encouraging kids to show up.”
True cost of educating kids
Schools have long asked the Legislature to change the funding formula, which they say doesn’t cover the actual costs of educating students, especially those with high needs. The issue came up repeatedly at a recent conference of the California School Boards Association, and there’s been at least one recent bill that addressed the issue.
The bill, by former Sen. Anthony Portantino, a Democrat from the La Cañada Flintridge area, initially called for a change to the funding formula, but the final version merely asked the Legislative Analyst’s Office to study the issue. The bill passed in 2024.
A 2022 report by Policy Analysis for California Education also noted the risks of removing schools’ financial incentive to prioritize attendance. But it also said that increasing school funding overall would give districts more stability.
Enrollment is a better funding metric because schools have to plan for the number of students who sign up, not the number who show up, said Troy Flint, spokesman for the California School Boards Association. 
He also noted that schools with higher rates of absenteeism also tend to have higher numbers of students who need extra help, such as English learners, migrant students and low-income students. Tying funding to daily attendance — which in some districts is as low as 60% — brings less money to those schools, ultimately hurting the students who need the most assistance, he said.  
“It just compounds the problem, creating a vicious cycle,” Flint said.
To really boost attendance, schools need extra funding to serve those students.
Switching to an enrollment-based funding model would increase K-12 funding by more than $6 billion, according to the Legislative Analyst’s Office. Currently, schools receive about $15,000 annually per student through the state’s main funding mechanism, the Local Control Funding Formula, with an additional $7,000 coming from the federal government, block grants, lottery money, special education funds and other sources. Overall, California spent more than $100 billion on schools last year, according to the Legislative Analyst.
Motivated by money?
Flint’s group also questioned whether schools are solely motivated by money to entice students to class.
“Most people in education desperately want kids in class every day,” Flint said. “These are some of the most dedicated, motivated people I’ve met, and they care greatly about students’ welfare.”
Josh Schultz, superintendent of the Napa County Office of Education, agreed. Napa schools that are funded through attendance actually have lower attendance than schools that are considered “basic aid,” and funded through local property taxes. Both types of schools have high numbers of English learners and migrant students.
“I can understand the logic (of the LAO’s assertion) but I don’t know if it bears out in reality, at least here,” Schultz said. “Both kinds of schools see great value in having kids show up to school every day.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/030122_High_School_1297_SW_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-07 08:57:39.374034

(Katie McKellar/Utah News Dispatch)State school trust lands officials announced this week that Utah public schools will get a record $134 million distribution from trust land investments in the 2026-2027 school year. 
That marks a 20% bump from last year’s previous record of $111.3 million. 
The increased distribution from the state’s longstanding trust lands system “reflects strong financial performance from trust land management” and the Permanent State School Fund’s investment portfolio, the Utah Land Trusts Protections & Advocacy Office said in a news release Monday. 
The jump also reflects the first year of additional money after Utah voters in 2024 approved a constitutional amendment, Amendment B, which increased how much can be distributed each year from the Permanent State School Fund, an endowment created at statehood to support public schools. Amendment B increased the limit of the annual distributions from 4% to 5% of the fund. 
Utah officials celebrate back to school with a record $111.3M from land investments

Had voters not passed Amendment B, schools this year would have received about $118 million during the 2026-2027 school year — meaning the 1 percentage point higher distribution cap allowed $16 million more to be distributed to schools this year. 
“This marks a significant milestone for Utah’s Trust System and the growing impact on all trust beneficiaries,” Kim Christy, director of the Land Trusts Protection and Advocacy Office, said in a prepared statement. “The Trust Lands Administration and (the Utah School & Institutional Trust Funds Office) are doing great things to uphold trust principles and sustain maximum performance of the trust assets.”
Utah Treasurer Marlo Oaks, who chairs the Utah School & Institutional Trust Funds Office board, also issued a statement applauding the record-breaking distribution. 
“Utah students benefit from a trust system that delivers strong results and protects both current and future beneficiaries,” Oaks said. “Careful land management and prudent investment decisions strengthen schools today and preserve the fund for generations to come.”
 School trust funds are generated from trust lands that were granted to Utah at statehood to support public education and other state institutions. The vast majority of the funds benefit school children, but other trust beneficiaries including higher education and other designated state institutions will also receive higher allocations. 
The revenue is generated from leases, sales and development of trust lands then deposited into the Permanent State School Fund. Since 1994, Utah’s combined permanent funds have grown from $50 million to $4.1 billion, according to trust lands officials. 
 How much will schools get? 
Yearly distributions from the School LAND Trust program are made to every public school in the state based on a per-pupil formula. State trust lands officials said individual schools will be notified later this week about their specific allocations. 
However, on Monday state trust lands officials offered a sneak peak by sharing a breakdown of what school districts in Salt Lake County will receive:

Jordan School District will get $10.5 million
Granite School District will get $10.2 million 
Canyons School District will get $6 million
Salt Lake City School District will get $3.5 million
Murray School District will get $1.3 million

The Salt Lake County school district allocations total $31.5 million. The remaining $102.5 million of this year’s $134 million allocation will be distributed to other public schools across the state based on student population. 
The funds, according to state trust lands officials, “support academic intervention and innovation, help reduce class size, expand access to technology, and enhance professional development.”

Decisions on how each school will use the money are made by local school community council members and land trust councils. Every school has a council that determines its greatest academic need, subject to approval by the school’s local school board. 
“Utah’s School LAND Trust distributions are the best form of local control,” Rep. Tracy Miller, R-South Jordan. “Parents, teachers, and principals work together to decide how to best use these funds to improve student learning and meet the unique needs of every community.”
How does Utah’s school land trust system work?
Four agencies make up Utah’s School and Institutional Trust System. 
The Trust Lands Administration manages about 3.3 million acres of trust lands in Utah, granted by Congress at statehood in 1896 with the requirement that revenue earned from the sale or lease of the land be placed into permanent endowment for public schools. The revenue is generated from activities like energy development, real estate and grazing. 
The School LAND Trust program, housed in the State Board of Education, distributes annual investment earnings directly to local K-12 schools and empowers communities to decide how best to meet their needs through land trust councils that decide how to spend the money. 
The Utah School & Institutional Trust Funds Office is made up of an independent team of investors tasked with investing the revenue in the Permanent State School Fund to grow the endowment. And the Utah Land Trusts Protection & Advocacy Office is tasked with monitoring trust lands management to ensure returns are maximized while ensuring the fund’s beneficiaries’ interests are protected and represented.

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector) Alabama’s tax collections remain among the lowest in the nation, making it harder for local governments to fund education and other services, according to a recent report from the Public Affairs Research Council of Alabama (PARCA).
The report found that while Alabama’s overall tax collections grew in 2023, it was still near the bottom of the nation for collections, beaten only by Tennessee and Mississippi, which have cut taxes in recent years. 
Thomas Spencer, one of the authors of the report, said in an interview Tuesday centuries-old tax restrictions and poverty both played a role.

“We have citizens that don’t have as much income, so higher rates of poverty in our state and so we have less wealth to tax,” he said.
The state also has the lowest property tax rate in the nation due to property tax caps first introduced in the 1875 Constitution and tightened in the 1901 Constitution, which took the vote away from Black Alabamians and poor whites. Collections were further limited by the lid bills in the 1970s, which capped property assessments. 
The report said that low property taxes help farmers, homeowners and timberland owners but makes it harder to fund education, public safety and health.
In fiscal year 2023, Alabama’s state and local governments collected over $4,900 per individual in taxes, including sales, property and income among other taxes. In comparison, the average total tax collected per individual for the southeastern states — where taxes are relatively low compared to the rest of the nation — was $5,198. 
The report noted that Arkansas, “a state with less wealth and economic activity than Alabama,” collected $354 more per person in taxes.
“If Alabama collected taxes at Arkansas’ rate, state and local governments would have an additional $1.8 billion in state dollars to fund education, health care, highways, public safety, and the broad spectrum of state and local services governments provide,” the report said.
In 2023, Mississippi began phasing out individual income taxes while Tennessee completely phased it out in the same year. Alabama’s income tax was established by constitutional amendment in 1933, an amendment that also included income tax thresholds and rates, with a top rate of 5% for married couples making $6,000 a year or more. While progressive for its time, the report notes that nearly a century of inflation means that they are “almost meaningless” today and subject low-income earners to the income tax.  
According to the report, nearly half of the revenue collected by Alabama’s local and state governments comes from sales taxes, in comparison to the rest of the nation where sales taxes make up one third of state and local taxes.
“We have a lot of constitutional protections built in that preclude local governments from raising taxes in above certain limits on property in particular, but there’s pretty much no restriction on sales tax, and so we have some of the highest sales tax rates in the country,” Spencer said.
Sales taxes are more costly to poorer residents, resulting in burdens on their earning power and less overall revenue. 
Alabama reduced the grocery tax from 3% to 2% last year. But this tax cut means less money for the Education Trust Fund, which is used to fund much of K-12 and higher education in the state.
“We’re going to have to keep an eye on our education funding to make sure it stays at a competitive level, so that we’re able to pay teachers and the other things that we’re continuing to do,” Spencer said.
Spencer also noted that the CHOOSE Act, a voucher-like program that can be used for education based expenses, including private school tuition, could pose a threat to the Education Trust Fund budget later on.
“We’re basically funding it with surplus money from prior years. But eventually, down the road, that could be, you know, a competent competition for education dollars,” he said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Alabama-State-Capitol-Nov-14-2025-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-07 08:12:21.793680
,California,2026-01-07 13:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,Critics draw iffy link between Gavin Newsom’s record and Minnesota’s food fraud scandal,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2026/01/gavin-newsom-critics-link-minnesota-fraud/,Republicans and at least one Democrat claim fraud and mismanagement during Newsom’s governorship are similar to Minnesota's debacle.,"Last month, as required by law, State Auditor Grant Parks published an annual report on state programs and agencies that his office deems to be at “high risk” of costly inefficiency, waste or fraud.
The report reiterated concerns about seven situations, two of which have been on the list since 2007, including the bureaucracy’s chronic inability to successfully employ information technology — embarrassing for a state that is the global center for digital tools.
Parks has added a new program in his latest overview, the Department of Social Service’s food aid for poor families, once called food stamps but now known as CalFresh.
The federal government primarily finances supplemental food benefits, but the state’s share is determined, in part, by its management, as indicated by its rate of error when determining people’s eligibility.
President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill tightens the error rate thresholds. Thus, Parks notes, California’s 11% error rate, if not improved, could require the state to “spend about $2 billion annually to maintain CalFresh benefits.”
The most disturbing item on Parks’ list is the continuing inability of the Employment Development Department to effectively manage unemployment insurance benefits, which first came to light during the COVID-19 pandemic. Billions of dollars in fraudulent benefit claims were approved, almost all of which came in a federally financed expansion of the program.
By happenstance, the high risk report was released just as a scandal was erupting in Minnesota over widespread fraud in a program meant to keep children fed during the pandemic.
Dozens of people, mostly in Minnesota’s substantial Somali population, have been charged with looting the program by setting up companies that billed the state for supplying food that was never delivered.
Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, whom Kamala Harris chose as her running mate in her campaign for president in 2024, felt the political fallout from the scandal — generated mostly in right-leaning media outlets — and this week dropped his bid for re-election.
Meanwhile, those same outlets — blogs, podcasts and YouTube videos — have been making an accusatory connection between the Minnesota scandal and the Parks report, suggesting the report proves the same kind of fraud was even more rampant in California and laying the blame on Gov. Gavin Newsom, who’s a likely 2028 candidate for president.
This week, Steve Hilton, a Republican candidate for California governor, and Herb Morgan, a Republican running for state controller, cited the Parks report, their own research and tips from whistleblowers in a broad assertion, dubbed “CALIFRAUDIA,” that “California’s exposure to fraud, waste, and abuse across major state programs is likely to reach $250 billion,” adding that it “underscores the urgent need for formal investigation and audit, as a matter of basic fiscal responsibility.”
However, the allegations of widespread fraud and mismanagement during Newsom’s governorship is not confined to those on the starboard side of the political balance beam.
Ro Khanna, a progressive Democratic member of Congress from Silicon Valley who could be a rival to Newsom in the 2028 presidential sweepstakes, issued a similar blast in a posting on X, albeit with a smaller $72 billion pricetag, citing Parks’ report and other data.
Khanna told Politico, “I don’t know what the specific number is” of dollars lost to fraud or mismanagement. “It’s not particular to any person,” Khanna said. “It’s making government more effective. Tackling the mismanagement and waste and some fraud will build more credibility for asking for higher taxes.”
Newsom’s staff responded by accusing Khanna of making a “MAGA made-up claim.”

The state will receive $203 million under the Rural Health Transformation Program, part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBA). The money is meant to partially offset cuts to Medicaid in the coming years. 
The state plans to distribute the money between 11 initiatives: Collaborative Electronic Health Record (EHR), IT and Cybersecurity; Rural Health; Maternal and Fetal Health; Rural Workforce; Cancer Digital Regionalization; Simulation Training; Statewide EMS Trauma and Stroke; EMS Treat-In-Place; Mental Health; Community Medicine; and Rural Health Practice. 
The state has not said how it plans to distribute the federal money among the initiatives.
The federal program will distribute $50 billion to states over five years, half of which will be evenly distributed and the other half will be under the discretion of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Alabama received $3.4 million in addition to the guaranteed $200 million.
According to the United Health Foundation, Alabama in September 2024 had 241 primary care physicians per 100,000 people, ranking 45th in the United States.
“Regardless of the cause, the solution is clear: Alabama must train, recruit and retain more physicians,” Dr. Mark LeQuire, president of MASA, said in a statement. 
According to the University of North Carolina’s Sheps Center, nine rural hospitals have closed in Alabama since 2009. Only 30% of the state’s rural hospitals have labor and delivery units, leaving many expectant parents to drive long distances for care. 
Many of Alabama’s existing hospitals are struggling. The state’s hospitals have long pushed for Medicaid expansion, saying it would provide needed funding to keep doors open. 
While Alabama Republican House leaders have signaled openness to a public-private hybrid approach to expansion, the Senate has been hostile, and removed a provision from a 2024 gambling bill that could have provided money for the program. 
Jackson suggested using some of the money from the Rural Health Transformation Program for incentive programs to retain medical students in Alabama after they complete their residencies. 
“Those existing programs have been successful, but their success is fairly limited, because it’s been limited to the amount of money they’ve had to spend,” Jackson said. 
 LeQuire suggested the money be used to create state-funded residency programs, especially in primary care.
“Doctors are far more likely to practice where they complete their residency training,” he said. “By investing in residency programs, Alabama can grow its physician workforce, improve access to care and strengthen the quality of life in rural communities.”
Jackson said that most residency programs are federally-funded, but there are a few that are state-funded. According to Marco Villagrana, a congressional policy analyst, CMS spent $6.1 billion on direct Graduate Medical Education in fiscal year 2023 nationwide. Those costs include the resident’s roughly $55,000 salary and the hospital’s cost to educate them.
“If the state can use some of this money to create additional residency slots in the state, then your chances of being able to retain those physicians in the state greatly increase,” Jackson said.
Jackson also suggested using the money to invest in telehealth programs, which would make it easier for patients in rural Alabama to get care from doctors from larger hospitals.
“If we could have some money dedicated towards that, I think that’s a kind of a new idea that I think could be beneficial,” he said.
The money will be administered through the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs (ADECA), according to the Dec. 29 statement from Ivey’s office.

(UMC photo)A federally-funded pilot program conducted by Clark County found a crisis intervention team is effective in keeping people with substance abuse and mental health issues out of local emergency rooms and is likely a cost savings for University Medical Center, the county’s public hospital, Clark County Commissioners learned Tuesday.
Nationally, up to 31% of 911 calls involve a police department response to individuals with mental health issues, according to a report on the pilot program presented to commissioners Tuesday. 
Crisis Response Teams (CRTs) are often panned by those who conflate them with efforts to defund the police. Law enforcement officials, however, generally welcome CRTs and the opportunity they give police and fire emergency responders to return to other duties. 
During his 2023 campaign for governor, then-Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo said people “don’t get the nuance” and observed that officers are often asked “to solve all these social problems by virtue of people dialing 911. We have to show up because we’re duty bound to show up but we’re not given the resources to address the issue and we can’t walk away. That’s the tragedy behind it. Our incarceration system is the largest mental health system in the state.” 
“So if they want to defund to develop teams per se, or a social worker – that type of profession – to address those types of calls, I’m in full support because we’re not the answer,” he said. 
In addition to assisting in reducing the burden on emergency responders, CRTs provide specialized care that helps individuals avoid emergency rooms and in many cases, the routine 72-hour mandatory hold for mental health evaluation known as Legal 2000.  
The $535,000 grant from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration allowed the county to field a 12-hour crew for six months – from April through September of 2025. The team, composed of a paramedic, an emergency medical technician, and a licensed social worker, is trained to identify diseases that can mimic mental illness. 
The CRT responded to 758 incidents involving 678 patients. Only 30% were taken to emergency rooms, compared with 82% of individuals involved in similar calls in 2024. 
The CRT referred 34% of patients to treatment for substance use, while 27% were transported directly to a behavioral health hospital, and 14% were transported to other community service providers.
The team de-escalated 94% of the incidents and prevented 572 patients from entering Legal 2000 holds. Additionally, 65% of the individuals restrained at the time the CRT arrived on scene no longer needed restraints after the team’s intervention, and only 8% arrived at their destinations in restraints, the report says.
Commissioner Justin Jones says Clark County is the only jurisdiction in Southern Nevada without a CRT. He’s spearheading the effort to permanently fund the program, projected to cost $1.5 million a year for a 12-hour operation, seven days a week. State grants are available for 24-hour operations. 
It would be offset by a potential $1.9 million savings in reimbursements for medical transport. 
Additionally, Medicaid reimbursement is available to help cover the cost of licensed social workers. 
“I would be very nervous about relying on the Medicaid reimbursement dollars, considering what’s going on as a whole,” Commissioner Marilyn Kirkpatrick warned, referring to more restrictive Medicaid eligibility requirements included in President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. 
Commissioner Jim Gibbons noted the CRT provides an opportunity for UMC, which is also expected to face financial challenges posed by Medicaid cuts, to save money by reducing ER admissions. 
The commission took no action Tuesday but is expected to return with proposals for funding a permanent CRT.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/UM-1024x548.jpg,,,2026-01-07 07:58:24.944362

Wired for Profit: Third in a series about Alabama Power’s influence over electric rates, renewable energy, pollution and politics in the Yellowhammer State.
BUCKS — South Alabama is where it all washes out.
Here, in the nation’s second-largest delta, the waters of the Deep South wind through the pines and cypresses of the Yellowhammer State, snaking their way into Mobile Bay and on to the Gulf. Among the most biodiverse regions in the country, the Mobile-Tensaw Delta drains 44,000 square miles of Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi. It’s where the rivers—the Mobile, Tensaw, Blakely, Apalachee, Middle and Spanish Rivers—meet in land dubbed the “American Amazon” by E.O. Wilson, a renowned naturalist born in the state.
The Delta’s history is America’s. At its heart are the island mounds of Bottle Creek, the “principal political and religious center” for the Indigenous Pensacola culture for 300 years before European contact.
About a dozen miles south, beneath the surface of the Mobile River’s muddy waters, lies the wreckage of the Clotilda, widely regarded as the last slave ship to enter the United States. And farther south, still, the Mobile River empties into Mobile Bay, itself a veritable biodiversity hotspot and the cornerstone of a vibrant coastal culture and ecosystem.

But all of that, many residents, experts and environmentalists say, is at risk, because of Alabama Power’s coal ash waste, a toxic leftover from decades of burning coal for electricity.
One 600-acre pit of the toxic coal ash lies along the banks of the Mobile River in the Upper Delta, about 25 miles north of Mobile Bay. There, smokestacks from the James M. Barry Electric Generating Plant rise like a sore thumb from a horizon of green, towering over an unlined pond filled with more than 21 million tons of the toxic residue. Holding back the toxic waste from the Mobile River? Earthen dikes.
Alyson Tucker, media relations manager for Alabama Power, one of the nation’s most profitable electric utilities and one of the state’s most powerful companies, said in an email that the company “remains committed to operating in full compliance with environmental regulations. Our plans for closure and groundwater protection fully comply with current state and federal law, are approved by [the Alabama Department of Environmental Management] and are certified by professional engineers.”
“Due to ongoing litigation related to Plant Barry coal ash, we are unable to comment further at this time,” Tucker said.
Leaving coal waste in place under engineered caps, company representatives have long argued, is safe and protective of groundwater—claims that state regulators have accepted but both environmental groups and federal regulators dispute.
Alabama’s American Amazon isn’t the only area placed at risk by Alabama Power’s ghosts of energy past. An Inside Climate News review of the utility’s legally mandated emergency action plans shows that hundreds of square miles of land and waterways would be at risk of inundation in the event of a breach of the barriers holding back toxic waste at its six coal ash pond sites across the state. In total, more than 117 million tons of coal sludge are at issue, stored along Alabama’s waterways.
What to do with all that polluted material has become a controversial question, with federal and state officials at odds over the issue. In 2015, the federal government finalized a rule tightening restriction around how coal waste could be stored. EPA left implementation of the new standards to states, but in May 2024, the agency denied the state of Alabama’s plan to allow Alabama Power and other utilities to continue storing toxic coal ash in unlined pits at sites across the state. Federal officials said the plan would not adequately protect the state’s groundwater from contamination by coal ash residuals following “cap-in-place” closure.
“Under federal regulations, coal ash units cannot be closed in a way that allows coal ash to continue to spread contamination in groundwater after closure. In contrast, Alabama’s permit program does not require that groundwater contamination be adequately addressed during the closure of these coal ash units,” the decision said.
More than a year after the EPA denied Alabama’s coal ash plan, with the Trump administration now running the federal environmental agency, it’s unclear what comes next for the toxic ponds and the government’s now decade-old effort to safely close them.
But one thing is certain, according to Cade Kistler, who leads Mobile Baykeeper, an environmental nonprofit currently in litigation with Alabama Power over the coal ash lagoon at Plant Barry. Until the toxic leftovers of the company’s fossil fuel commitments are moved out of groundwater and away from waterways, the delta and Mobile Bay are an Eden on the edge of disaster.
“The delta is an elegant labyrinth, full of bayous and sloughs and backwaters. If it is flooded with ash, it would be polluting forever,” Kistler said. “There would be no way to effectively clean it up.”
The cost of Kingston
The failure of a dirt dike at a coal ash pond isn’t theoretical. In 2008, a coal ash impoundment in Kingston, Tennessee, breached, spilling more than a billion gallons of toxic sludge across 300 acres of land and into the Emory River channel. The result was one of the largest environmental disasters in U.S. history. The spill cost the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), which owned the coal impoundment, over $1 billion to clean up. Ten years after the spill, dozens of the roughly 900 workers employed during the cleanup were already dead. More than 250 were chronically ill. According to the EPA, coal ash contains heavy metal contaminants like mercury, cadmium and arsenic known to cause cancer and other serious effects on the nervous system, heart, kidneys and development.
Both Alabama Power’s own groundwater monitoring reports and measurements taken by researchers from the Mobile River adjacent to Plant Barry confirm heavy metal contamination at the site.
“We identified a significant contribution of toxic metals linked to coal ash near Sister’s Creek, the man-made cooling discharge channel of Plant Barry, particularly during the dry season,” one 2025 study by scientists at the University of Alabama and Texas A&M Universities concluded.  The peer-reviewed paper also pointed to the impacts of climate change as another reason to be wary of Alabama Power’s storage of coal ash on waterways.

– Cade Kistler, Mobile Baykeeper



	“There is a plausible concern for acute and chronic toxic metals environmental pollution from the Alabama ash pond, considering rising seawater levels and more frequent severe storm surges in the region since its initial construction,” the study said.
The volume of coal ash material stored at Plant Barry alone is more than four times that of the sludge that spilled in Kingston in 2008, according to company figures. That fact alone should worry anyone concerned about Alabama’s environment, said Diane Thomas, one of three self-proclaimed “coal ash grannies” featured in a new documentary about Plant Barry’s coal lagoons, Sallie’s Ashes.
Thomas spent three decades living on the eastern shore of Mobile Bay.
“I have kayaked and sailed,” she said. “I swam. I crabbed. I fished. My love for the bay and what you can do on the bay runs deep.”

It was an easy “yes,” then, when her decades-long friend Sallie Smith asked Thomas and another friend, Savan Wilson, to help her fight against Alabama Power’s plans to leave coal ash beside the Mobile River. Smith had been diagnosed with terminal cancer and felt she needed to spend her remaining time advocating to protect the bay she’d grown to adore. The trio founded the Coal Ash Action Group, a grassroots organization committed to educating Alabamians about an issue unknown to many.
Thomas, a retired clinical psychologist, said it’s easy to fight for something so dear to so many. For decades, the delta and the bay have been an integral part of her family’s lives.

She smiled as she recalled her first jubilee, a naturally occurring event where low oxygen levels in Mobile Bay cause marine life to flee toward shore.
“There is nothing like catching your own crabs,” Thomas said. “Have you ever cleaned 200 crabs? Your thumbs are just raw.”
After her husband was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer, no longer able to work, he began to fish almost daily. With aggressive treatment, he survived the disease.
“We ate fresh fish for about eight years—four times a week,” Thomas said.
That type of close connection with the water is something Thomas feels shouldn’t be put at risk unnecessarily by an electric utility.
‘    
A knife to your throat’

Alabama Power’s legally-mandated emergency action plan for Plant Barry shows that if earthen dikes separating the coal ash from the Mobile River were to breach, around 25 square miles of the Mobile-Tensaw Delta would be inundated with coal slurry, covering dozens of miles of the Mobile, Middle and Tensaw Rivers, just upstream of Mobile Bay. From there, the toxic sludge would diffuse throughout the region, with the state’s rivers acting as a heart, pumping the liquid farther and farther from Plant Barry.
“But instead of lifeblood, it’s pumping coal waste that would kill the environment,” Thomas said.
David Bronner, the prominent CEO of the Retirement Systems of Alabama, recently called Plant Barry’s coal ash pond “a huge environmental bomb” in a newsletter sent to state retirees.

“We need your cooperation again for South Alabama,” Bronner wrote in an open appeal to Alabama’s congressional delegation. “Not for new jobs, but for solving an old problem that still exists. That problem hangs over all of Alabama, like a knife to your throat: the coal ash dump that sits next to Mobile Bay. No one should forget what the Tennessee coal ash dump did to that state. A breach of the Mobile site would clearly damage Mobile Bay for decades.”
Thomas believes Bronner’s assessment is on target.


Cade Kistler, Mobile’s Baykeeper, said it’s important to remember that environmental harm can lead to economic pain, too, for individuals and businesses alike.
“There would be a huge impact on the people that want to fish in Mobile Bay and use it for their livelihoods,” he said. “And there are also those people that live on its shores—a lot of beautiful homes and properties. Those Zillow listings won’t look quite so good if a coal ash breach occurs.”

Kistler also pointed out that BP’s 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, which crippled the Gulf Coast environmentally and economically, involved about 134 million gallons of oil, 20 times less than the volume of coal slurry disposed of at Plant Barry. Those who lived through the aftermath of the oil spill on the Gulf Coast remember the deep impact it had on coastal communities.


A coal ash breach could be even worse, Thomas said.
“If a breach occurred, we would be the most industrially polluted site in the nation, and we know that pollution wouldn’t just go away,” she said.
That’s why she and Wilson have committed themselves to informing others across the state about the dangers of the waste, something they now do in memory of Smith, who died of cancer in October 2023.
“Sallie’s focus was on connecting people in search of our common humanity, and in seeking to deepen our understanding and compassion for one another,” her obituary read. “This ardent effort was an outgrowth and demonstration of her deep faith. She loved her family, Mobile Bay, country music, her many friends, including her hiking group of intrepid college friends, and all God’s people.”

‘Pray we don’t have a hurricane’

While there’s still much to be done to contain the coal ash threat, Thomas said, there have been at least some glimmers of hope. In early 2024, Alabama Power confirmed a plan to contract a company called Eco Materials to remove and recycle some of the coal waste stored at Plant Barry.
Since then, however, there has been little in the way of substantive public updates about the project, which company officials previously said would begin recycling coal ash into construction materials like concrete in January 2026. In response to an inquiry from Inside Climate News, a representative for Alabama Power said the recycling facility is “expected to be in service by early 2026.”
Eco Materials was acquired by materials company CRH in July 2025, according to an announcement. Neither Eco Materials nor CRH responded to a request for a detailed update on the recycling plans.

Still, Thomas said that even the conception of a plan is a step in the right direction.
“We need to recycle as much as possible and just pray we don’t have a hurricane,” she said.
Kistler said he fears just that. An extreme weather event or other emergency could leave a world-renowned environmental gem drowned in polluted sludge.
Alabama Power’s emergency action plans, bare-bones documents required by federal law, provide only limited information about what could occur if a breach happened at its coal ash sites across the state. The documents also provide little real-world information about how the company would approach mitigation, clean up and remediation.
Regarding extreme weather, the 39-page emergency plan for Plant Barry mentions only that if severe weather causes road closures during an emergency dam breach, company response times may be delayed. Despite Plant Barry’s location in south Alabama, the word “hurricane” does not appear in the emergency action plan.
“It’s foolhardy,” Kistler said. “There needs to be more detail.”
Regulators have agreed. In January 2023, the EPA issued Alabama Power a notice of potential violation informing the company that, in the agency’s view, it had violated federal regulations because its groundwater monitoring program and emergency action plan were not adequate.
The agency settled that dispute with Alabama Power in 2024 when the company agreed to “evaluate and expand its groundwater monitoring program at Plant Barry, to review and upgrade its Emergency Action Plan, and to pay a civil penalty of $278,000,” according to the EPA.
More than a year later, a representative of the utility told members of Alabama’s Public Service Commission that an updated emergency action plan is still in the works.
“The emergency action plan will be modified to include additional wording and descriptions to clarify the company’s preparedness for extreme weather conditions,” Dustin Brooks, land compliance manager for Alabama Power, told commissioners on Dec. 9.
“I just hope that outside this public document, they’ve got better plans somewhere,” Kistler said.
A previously available copy of the EPA’s settlement agreement with Alabama Power has been removed from the agency’s website, though the press release announcing the agreement remains. “This Initiative is needed given the breadth and scope of observed noncompliance with the federal coal ash regulations,” the agency said.
An executive of Alabama Power, which owns most of the state’s coal ash units, claimed at a September 2023 EPA hearing that the utility’s storage ponds are “structurally sound.” Susan Comensky, Alabama Power’s then-vice president of environmental affairs, told EPA officials that allowing the company to “cap” coal ash waste in place, even in unlined pits, will not present significant risks to human or environmental health.
“Even today, before closure is complete, we know of no impact to any source of drinking water at or around any Alabama Power ash pond,” Comensky said at the time.

However, Alabama Power has been repeatedly fined for leaking coal ash waste into groundwater.
In 2019, the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) fined the utility $250,000 after groundwater monitoring at a disposal site on the Coosa River in Gadsden showed elevated levels of arsenic and radium, according to regulatory documents.
In 2018, ADEM fined Alabama Power a total of $1.25 million for groundwater contamination, records show. In its order issuing the fine, the agency cited the utility’s own groundwater testing data, which showed elevated levels of arsenic, lead, selenium and beryllium.
Plant Barry is just one of Alabama Power’s six plant sites across the state that store coal ash. In all, the slurry lagoons cover a footprint of around 2,000 acres and pose unique risks to groundwater and waterways around them.
A now capped-in-place coal ash impoundment at Plant Gadsden, for example, is still contaminating groundwater more than seven years after its closure, according to Alabama Power’s groundwater monitoring reports and a lawsuit filed against the utility by Coosa Riverkeeper, an environmental nonprofit.
“The citizens of Gadsden and folks who depend on Neely Henry Lake deserve so much better than Alabama Power’s legacy of pollution,” Justinn Overton, executive director and riverkeeper at Coosa Riverkeeper, said in a news release after the lawsuit was filed. “Drinking water supply, booming ecotourism, and hard-working Alabamians are all threatened by Alabama Power’s recklessness.”
In a motion to dismiss the lawsuit over groundwater contamination at Plant Gadsden, lawyers for Alabama Power emphasized that state regulators approved the company’s plans for coal ash waste at the site.
When groundwater monitoring identified elevated levels of contaminants, the lawyers wrote, “Alabama Power worked with professional engineers and the public to design and implement a corrective action program to address those exceedances—a program certified as compliant with the federal CCR rule and that will continue as part of ‘post-closure care.’”
While the suit should be dismissed due to an expired statute of limitations, Alabama Power’s attorneys argued, the court should also decline to second guess the decision of state regulators to approve the company’s actions.
“[Coosa Riverkeeper] asks the Court to turn back the clock, to before 2020, to second-guess the groundwater monitoring system and closure decisions—work completed long ago, approved by state regulators, and certified by professional engineers as compliant,” the motion said.
Plants Barry, Gorgas, Greene County and Miller have been designated as having “significant hazard potential” under federal law. Plant Gaston, located near the town of Wilsonville in Shelby County, has been designated as having “high hazard potential.”
Following an emergency dam break at that site, which the company deems “unlikely,” Alabama Power’s initial hazard potential assessment concluded that “water and [coal ash] could potentially impact the residential neighborhood to the west, and the Coosa River to the south…failure or misoperation of the [coal ash] unit could potentially result in a loss of human life.”
Kistler said that it’s notable that Alabama Power is unique among southern utilities in leaving all of its coal waste in unlined pits along waterways. Georgia Power, another subsidiary of Southern Company, has already shifted toward more appropriate disposal of at least some of its coal ash in lined landfills. It’s not a question then, Kistler said, of whether Alabama Power can do the same. It’s only a question of if it will.
“It feels like we’re paying premium prices, and we’re getting bargain-bin environmental protections,” he said, making a reference to Alabama Power’s highest average residential electric bills in the nation. “If Georgia can do it, why not us?”

A coal legacy and a fossil-fueled future

Barry Brock, with the Southern Environmental Law Center, is part of the team of lawyers suing Alabama Power over its coal ash impoundment at Plant Barry. Initially dismissed by a Trump-appointed U.S. district court judge on technical grounds, the case is now pending before the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, where Brock said he is hopeful the team will secure a victory.
Oral arguments in the case were held in Atlanta in November, and some of Alabama Power’s arguments were unusually revealing, Brock said.
“Alabama Power admits that a lot of the coal ash is going to be left in contact with groundwater under their closure plan,” he said. “That’s particularly galling.”
Coal ash isn’t SELC’s first legal tussle with Alabama Power, however. Lawyers for the environmental nonprofit are also representing customers suing Alabama Power over residential solar fees they argue violate the law and discourage the use of renewable energy. In response, the company has said that it “support[s] customers interested in using onsite generation, such as solar” but that its rate structure for those customers must avoid “unfairly shifting” costs to other ratepayers.
Meanwhile, the company has doubled down on its fossil fuel investments, purchasing a natural gas plant in Autauga County for around $622 million, effectively locking the company into the continued use of fossil fuels for years to come, though the company said in an email that its investments are data-driven, forward-looking and “are not based on a preference for any one fuel source.”
All of these developments are individually concerning, Brock said, and together, they demonstrate a pattern.
“It sends a pretty clear message that Alabama Power is really concerned about their financial well-being and the rate of return they get on fossil fuel infrastructure,” he said. “It says they have a pretty compliant regulatory environment that is not going to scrutinize them when they want to raise rates for customers to do it.”
While the company clearly has the resources to line its coal ash ponds and recycle much of the waste, there’s also little doubt that the state can count on much more sympathetic federal regulators under the Trump EPA than it did under Democratic leadership. At present, the state and federal governments seem closely aligned: Twinkle Cavanaugh recently resigned after 13 years as president of the state’s Public Service Commission, the agency charged with regulating Alabama Power.

Mike Young, R-Indianapolis, discusses his Senate Bill 11, which would allow Indiana to use a firing squad to carry out executions, during a committee meeting on Tuesday, Jan. 6, 2026. (Photo by Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)A bill that would allow executions by firing squad if lethal injection drugs are unavailable or at an inmate’s request is fueling ongoing debates over secrecy, drug costs and “humane” methods of capital punishment.
Senators on the Corrections and Criminal Law Committee spent an hour probing Republican Sen. Mike Young’s Senate Bill 11 — and some questioned whether it’s necessary at all — but no vote was held.
Committee Chairman Sen. Aaron Freeman, R-Indianapolis, said the committee would consider amendments and a possible vote next week. Proposed amendments are due on Friday.
“This is not a debate about the death penalty,” Young, of Indianapolis, told the committee. “We have it in the state of Indiana. So, it’s not whether you think it’s good or whether you think it’s bad. The question here is, ‘What do we do if we only have one option in which to carry out a legal order by the courts in the state of Indiana?’”
Over the past year, Indiana officials have paid as much as $300,000 for a single dose, spending at least $1 million total to procure execution drugs. Gov. Mike Braun disclosed in June that at least $600,000 was spent on pentobarbital that expired before use, citing the drug’s short shelf life and difficulties obtaining it. Braun has since declined to disclose how much the state paid for the most recent doses, including at least one used in the October execution of Roy Ward.










Indiana should not be considering expanding its execution methods while significant issues of public accountability still exist.


– Robert Dunham, director of the Death Penalty Policy Project and former executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center


Young’s bill is one of several death penalty-related measures pending in the 2026 session.
He argued that his proposal is designed to prevent Indiana from being forced into last-minute decisions if lethal injection drugs become unusable.
“If we have an order to carry out an execution, we go get the chemicals, and then we find out, ‘Well, those are out of date and they’re not going to work,’” the senator said. “There’s no way to really test to see if they work, other than apply them, and we don’t want to put a person’s life in anguish to find out whether or not the drugs work.”
Young also told lawmakers that manufacturers and pharmacies can refuse to sell execution drugs on moral grounds, further creating a need for an alternative method. 
“We can’t force them to sell it to us,” he said. “We can’t force them to manufacture it.”
A ‘fail safe’ option
Under current Indiana law, executions can only be carried out by lethal injection. 
Young’s bill details procedures for firing squad executions, requiring a five-member team made up of Department of Correction officers selected by the prison warden.
Four officers would fire weapons containing live ammunition, while one would fire a weapon containing a blank round, with firearms loaded in a way that prevents squad members from knowing which ammunition they are firing. The bill would also shield the identities of firing squad members from public disclosure and legal discovery.
Currently, five states authorize the use of firing squads under certain circumstances: Idaho, Utah, Oklahoma, Mississippi, and South Carolina.
Young emphasized that the bill does not mandate the firing squad, but instead creates what he repeatedly described as a “fail-safe” option if lethal injection cannot be carried out.
Indiana lawmakers tee up new death penalty bills ahead of short 2026 session

He also cited the federal prison in Terre Haute, where the U.S. Bureau of Prisons has long carried out executions.
“If the federal government needs to carry out an execution here in Indiana and they can’t obtain the drugs, we shouldn’t be the reason that can’t happen,” Young said.
Before public testimony began, Sen. Rodney Pol, D-Chesterton, asked whether firing squads could pose similar constitutional problems as the electric chair decades ago if an execution did not result in immediate death.
“The idea that we were using the electric chair — it was inhumane,” Pol said. “Oftentimes, somebody would not perish … and you could have a situation in which, during the firing squad, somebody has not perished. … You’re laying witness to what potentially could be cruel and unusual punishment.”
But Young maintained that the central issue with any method is accuracy and avoiding such suffering.
“The question is whether or not the shots that are fired are accurate enough to end the life immediately instead of letting the person suffer,” Young said. “That’s the concern.”
Committee members also raised questions about who would be required to participate in a firing squad and whether staff could object on religious or moral grounds. 
Young said he supports “conscience protections” and would not compel participation. 
“I wouldn’t force somebody to take somebody else’s life,” he said. “If I was the warden, I’d probably take volunteers.”
Specifics still in the works
Five men currently sit on Indiana’s death row at the state prison in Michigan City, though one has been deemed incompetent to be executed. 
Three other men have been executed in Indiana over the past year. In that time, scrutiny has mounted around the state’s execution process and the Department of Correction’s acquisition and handling of lethal injection drugs.

Many of the questions center on the cost, sourcing, storage and effectiveness of pentobarbital. The one-drug method is a departure from the state’s protocol used since 1995, involving a series of three chemicals.
Tuesday’s testimony highlighted concerns that chemical executions can fail or cause prolonged suffering if drugs degrade or are improperly administered. Questions have lingered, for example, around the quality of the drugs used in last year’s execution of Benjamin Ritchie.
Bill co-author Sen. Jim Tomes, R-Wadesville, told the Indiana Capital Chronicle that the firing squad could be structured to “minimize the risk of error.” He described a system using five shooters and rifles fixed in place by technicians so that all rounds strike the same point. The senator said he preferred live rounds and no blanks for all shooters.
“A technician would set the rifles up so all of the barrels are pointed at the same point of impact,” Tomes said. “They’re fixed. There’s no movement. The guns have been set so that the impact is all going to be at the same center of mass.”
Young was supportive, saying the goal is to ensure executions are carried out “efficiently and effectively so no person suffers.”
Opposition centers on secrecy, oversight
Opponents warned, though, that the bill would expand capital punishment while shielding “critical” details from public scrutiny.
Samantha Bresnahan of the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana said Senate Bill 11 would impose “unprecedented secrecy” around executions by making confidential the identities of firing squad members and any information that could reasonably lead to their identification.
“That language is extraordinarily broad,” she said. “It could shield basic facts about training, qualifications, selection criteria and safeguards — precisely the information the public needs to evaluate whether this process is lawful, competent and free from misconduct.”
Even so, current Indiana law protects much of that information already, including the identities of the state prison’s execution team. 
Robert Dunham, director of the Death Penalty Policy Project and former executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, additionally testified in opposition, calling the bill “a solution in search of a problem.”
“Indiana should not be considering expanding its execution methods while significant issues of public accountability still exist,” Dunham said. “Executions are among the most serious acts a government can undertake, yet this bill would allow this method to be implemented behind a veil of secrecy.”
DOC silent, amendments ahead
Public defenders also questioned whether Young’s bill would meaningfully address the cost or availability of executions. 
Zach Stock with the Indiana Public Defender Council said execution drugs are not a major cost driver compared with decades of litigation. He noted that since 1990, Indiana has spent more than $30 million on constitutionally-required defenses in capital cases.
“Trading expensive drugs for inexpensive bullets is not going to meaningfully reduce the cost,” Stock said. “Method of execution has never been the problem.”
Faith-based groups raised concerns about the moral and psychological toll on those involved.
Roarke LaCoursiere of the Indiana Catholic Conference warned that participation in executions can cause long-term trauma for witnesses and staff.
“Under this bill, we would be asking five people to pull the trigger, not for the purpose of saving life, but for the purpose of ending it,” LaCoursiere said.
DOC officials were present at Tuesday’s hearing but did not testify publicly.
Young’s bill is one of several death-penalty-related measures so far filed in the short 2026 session.
House Bill 1119, authored by Reps. Jim Lucas, R-Seymour, and Andrew Ireland, R-Indianapolis, would also allow executions by firing squad — or nitrogen hypoxia — while keeping lethal injection as the default method unless an inmate requests otherwise.
Another filed by Ireland, House Bill 1314, seeks to speed up post-conviction relief proceedings, likely reducing the time inmates spend on death row before execution.
Separately, House Bill 1287, filed by Rep. Bob Morris, R-Fort Wayne, would require members of the General Assembly to volunteer to serve on execution teams and make their names public records.
Last session, Morris unsuccessfully pushed to abolish Indiana’s death penalty entirely or, alternatively, to increase transparency around execution protocols.
Young said he expects multiple amendments to be filed to his bill before Friday’s deadline, including potential changes related to firing squad procedures.
“This is about making sure the state can carry out the law in a way that is orderly, constitutional and humane,” Young said. “We’re going to continue to work through the details.”

Dils Medical Center in Caliente, Nevada. (Photo: Nevada Rural Hospital Partners) While health authority officials updated state lawmakers on Tuesday on how the state will use $180 million in federal rural hospital funding provided by the One Big Beautiful Bill, they’re also trying to gauge how the allocation compares to the projected loss in funds rural Nevada will face due to pending Medicaid cuts scheduled go into effect in in less than a year.
President Donald Trump’s massive spending and tax cut bill passed last year included a $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program to offset part of the bill’s substantial cuts to Medicaid. Half of the rural health money will be distributed equally among each state between fiscal years 2026 and 2030, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
The remaining $25 billion is being allocated to states based on several factors, such as steps states are taking to improve access to care in rural communities.
The administration unveiled the breakdown of initial state funding last week, which showed the amount of funding Nevada receives from the Trump administration program will rank among the lowest 10 of the 50 states.
Nationally, the rural funding program would only offset a little more than one-third of the bill’s estimated $137 billion cuts to federal Medicaid spending in rural areas over the next decade, according to an analysis from the nonpartisan health research organization KFF. 
Nevada could lose an estimated $553 million according to that analysis.
The state’s Medicaid office is waiting for federal guidance on changes affecting one substantial funding stream, the state’s hospital provider tax program, which provides “significant funding to roughly 45 private hospitals” including six private rural hospitals, said Allison Genco Herzik, the chief of staff with Nevada Health Authority, in an email Tuesday.
“Early estimates of the impact of these changes show … $600-$800 million a year in reduced provider tax related payments to hospitals by the end of 2028,” she said in an email. “Based on the current distribution of provider tax funds in Nevada, the impact of these losses will fall primarily on the state’s urban acute hospitals, and not rural hospitals.”
Officials with the Nevada Health Authority gave members of the legislative Interim Committee on Health and Human Services a general overview of how the $179.9 million federal grant funding will be prioritized Tuesday.
The federal funding is expected to support four initiatives with the largest portion, roughly 40%, targeted at attracting health care providers to rural parts of the state, said Stacie Weeks, director of the Nevada Health Authority. 
However, one idea the state initially proposed was rejected by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and its administrator, physician and former media celebrity Mehmet Oz. 
“We wanted to do a loan repayment program, a very large one,” Weeks said. “We heard very loud and clear from Dr. Oz and others — they were not interested in that.”
The plan, instead, proposes using funds to for incentives such as signing bonuses or housing assistance to entice health care providers to move to rural areas. 
Other initiatives prioritized by Nevada health officials include a “rural health outcomes accelerator” to address root causes of chronic diseases, and a rural health care “flex fund.”
“We heard a lot from our rural hospitals that can’t afford to buy an ambulance or can’t afford the new x-ray machine or mammogram, all the things they need to support their community,” Weeks said. “This flex fund is to support those one-time infrastructure needs.” 
Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill also directs 15% of the rural health funding program toward health innovation and technology, which Weeks said “was something CMS really wanted to see in our applications.” The idea would be to fund new technologies around telehealth or “artificial intelligence” tools in health care. 
“We had multiple vendors wanting this money, and that is not always bad,” Weeks said. “I want to be mindful that this money is sustainable for communities and actually is going to improve health care. We want to be careful it’s not just a slush fund for every new idea, and that these are meaningful and evidence-based solutions.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/caliente-1024x623.jpg,,,2026-01-07 07:12:28.586858

Tim Walz announces he will step down from the 2026 gubernatorial election Monday, Jan. 5, 2026 at the Minnesota State Capitol. (Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Minnesota trailed the nation in economic growth during Gov. Tim Walz’s tenure, but Minnesotans continued to enjoy higher wages than most states, lower unemployment and a decrease in crime.
Walz announced the end of his campaign for a third term on Monday in the face of increasing pressure from his own party and attacks from Republicans over widespread fraud in state-run social services programs.
He said he takes accountability for the fraud that happened on his watch as well as the successes of his administration through the remarkable lows and highs of his tenure: the COVID-19 pandemic, the murder of George Floyd, Democrats winning control of state government and passing a sweeping progressive agenda, and the assassination of his friend and colleague Melissa Hortman.
“If the buck stops with me on when there’s problems, the buck stops with me on successes,” Walz said at a Tuesday news conference celebrating the rollout of the state’s paid family leave program.
Here are eight charts exploring how the state has been doing over the course of Walz’s tenure since 2019.


Minnesota’s economy grew slower than the nation’s, as measured by gross domestic product — the state’s output of goods and services. The U.S. economy grew around 16% since 2019, while Minnesota’s grew 10% in the same time frame.
The Minnesota Chamber of Commerce, which represents companies in Minnesota, published a report in November finding that job growth and income growth in the state is also not keeping pace with the nation’s.


Unemployment is creeping back up after a low in 2022 according to the September data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. Unemployment in Minnesota remains lower compared to the U.S. as a whole, but higher than some other states in the region.
In an August release, Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development Commissioner Matt Varilek said that employment trends might be the result of federal layoffs, funding freezes and tariff policies under the Trump administration, along with shrinking immigration.


Minnesotans still earn the highest average hourly wages in the Midwest. The average Minnesota worker earned $37.58 per hour in 2024, compared to $32.66 nationally, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Wages have generally matched or outpaced inflation over the past several decades. Although high inflation coming out of the pandemic eroded many workers’ buying power, wage growth has since caught up. Low-wage workers — particularly those in nursing homes and food service — benefited the most from a tight labor market, which has pushed wages up much more quickly than inflation in recent years.


Index crimes — a group of eight serious crimes that law enforcement agencies use to track crime over time — were lower in 2024 than at the start of Walz’s term in 2019, according to the most recent data from the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension.
The total crime rate in 2024 was at a multi-decade low, driven by a drop in property crimes. Meanwhile, homicide rates dropped from a COVID-era spike but still remained high.


Minnesota students’ performance on state-wide standardized tests have stagnated since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic closed schools in 2020. Proficiency rates in reading and math in 2025 were 10 percentage points lower than they were in 2019. In 2025, fewer than half of Minnesota students met grade-level expectations for reading and math.


More Minnesota families are getting their kids out of routine vaccinations, reflecting growing vaccine skepticism across the nation bolstered by President Donald Trump’s appointment of vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.
Nearly 6% of Minnesota kindergartners received non-medical vaccine exemptions in 2024, compared to 3.4% in 2019.


Even so, Minnesotans can expect to live longer than people in other states in the Midwest, according to the National Center for Health Statistics’ life expectancy estimates for a person born in 2022.


State Fair attendance — an important metric of Minnesotans’ pride in their Minnesotan-ness — was a record high in 2019. The pandemic put a damper on sales of pronto pups and other sticked foods, with the 2020 state fair cancelled and the 2021 state fair only hosting 1.3 million people, compared to 2.1 million in 2019.
Attendance has been rising since then, though, with numbers back up to 1.9 million in the past two years.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/MG_9332-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-07 07:12:28.586858

Tom Barrett in the November election, is putting anti-corruption reforms at the forefront of her first big policy rollout as the 2026 election cycle begins.
Brink, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine who resigned in opposition to the Trump administration’s policies in the region, on Wednesday announced her plans for cleaning up Washington, D.C. across all three branches of the federal government.
“The chaos and corruption coming out of Washington is costing Michiganders,” Brink said in a statement. “We need a principled, pragmatic reform agenda and leaders willing to fight like hell to restore faith in government and clean up Washington.”
First on the list is to officially ban the offices of the president and vice president, members of Congress, all executive branch employees and U.S. Supreme Court justices from trading individual stocks. Brink is also proposing a permanent, lifetime ban on members of Congress from becoming lobbyists, and prohibiting their immediate family members from serving as registered lobbyists during their time in office.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Brink said she would push for a constitutional amendment creating term limits for Congress, while also advocating for measures to block pay to members during government shutdowns.
Legislation clarifying and limiting the powers of the president to issue pardons would also be top of mind for Brink should she win the August primary and defeat Barrett (R-Charlotte) in the fall general election.
Also on the proposed policy list are:

A ban on all branches receiving gifts of more than $20;
A  constitutional amendment overturning the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Citizens United, effectively banning the unlimited spending of dark money by corporations and wealthy individuals; and
A new, binding code of ethics for the president, vice president, Congress, executive appointees, and the high court’s justices, which would include a requirement for full financial and tax disclosures.

Brink said the policy proposals were aimed at restoring people’s faith in government. 
“That means standing up for what’s right, speaking truth to power, and delivering real results — even if it means risking one’s career. I’ve done that throughout my 28 years of service to our country and I’ll do it again in Congress,” Brink said.
The Democratic primary race for the 7th District also includes retired Navy SEAL Matt Maasdam, Elyon Badger, William Lawrence, Alexandra Prieditis and Muhammad Salman Rais.

Not if you’re the Mississippi House speaker,Emily Wagster Pettus,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/07/mississippi-house-speaker-press-restriction/,"The door of House Speaker Jason White's office in the Mississippi Capitol on Tuesday, Jan. 6, 2026.","The audio version of this story is AI generated and is not human reviewed. It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
For journalists, getting into a politician’s press conference at the Mississippi Capitol shouldn’t be like trying to get into a fancy party at a country club.
Not on the invitation list? You’re out of luck.
House Speaker Jason White and his staff made a bumble-headed decision by blocking a Mississippi Today reporter from attending White’s pre-legislative session Q&A on Monday – a decision that violates the principles of government transparency. 
The invitation-only press conference was open to most news organizations that regularly cover the Legislature, and it took place in White’s office in the Capitol. The Republican from West occupies the space because his House colleagues chose him as their leader and because taxpayers are footing the bill to keep the office running.
Mississippi Today published an investigative report last April about Speaker White, members of his staff and some of their spouses taking a trip to the Super Bowl in New Orleans. Expenses for the trip were paid, at least in part, by DraftKings, a gaming company that has invested heavily in lobbying for legal online betting. After Mississippi Today posted its report, the speaker’s office stopped sending Mississippi Today advisories about press conferences and stopped responding to the newsroom’s requests for comments.
Mississippi Speaker of the House Jason White and some of his staff and spouses attended the Super Bowl.
Monday’s closed-door press conference happened the day before Mississippi legislators started their three-month session. It was the only opportunity White provided for journalists – on behalf of the public – to question him about the all-important issues he will push during this third year of a four-year term, including an effort to let some people spend public money in private schools.
Legislators make decisions each session that can change the lives of everyday Mississippians. Members of the House and Senate distribute billions of taxpayer dollars and set policies that could alter access to education and health care, roads and bridges, public welfare and public safety.
Mississippi Today and other news organizations send journalists to the Capitol to report on what elected officials are discussing and doing. It’s vital work that journalists take seriously because – let’s face it – most Mississippians are busy with their own lives and can’t drop everything to keep an eye on elected officials.
Some of the most substantial Capitol news coverage is rooted in source development. Journalists build relationships of trust with legislators, lobbyists or others who provide inside information about what’s happening that might not be readily apparent to the general public. Good journalists don’t regurgitate unvetted information. Instead, they verify it and put it in context.
Press conferences often provide ready-made news on a plate and sometimes provide no news at all. They are generally open to all credentialed journalists. For decades, standard practice has been for politicians’ staffers to notify Mississippi Capitol reporters about these events, whether they are in open-access areas such as the building’s marble-lined rotunda or in an office or a conference room. 
Even politicians who grumble about news coverage or editorials have generally avoided taking overt steps to exclude certain news organizations from press conferences. That includes, notably, Kirk Fordice, the state’s first Republican governor in modern times.
Fordice served two terms in the 1990s and was the first governor I covered during my 31 years as a Capitol journalist. Fordice constantly groused about the media. One of his favorite complaints was about editorial writers at The Clarion-Ledger, or as he derisively called them, “pencil pushers on Pearl Street.” (To get the full effect, say that out loud and emphasis each P so much that you nearly spit.) Fordice generally gave the Capitol reporters access to his events, even as he chewed us out for asking questions he didn’t like.
White acknowledged Monday that he engaged in picking and choosing which journalists could show up and ask him questions during his pre-session gathering. 
“The Media Q+A hosted in my office today was an invitation-only media opportunity, not an open, public press conference,” he said in a statement to the Clarion Ledger.
That’s a weird attempt to differentiate between “media Q&A” and “press conference,” which are the same thing. And it’s the kind of statement that comes from a public official who’s not committed to government transparency.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/06160556/829A0689.jpg,,,2026-01-07 07:12:28.586858

They take an oath to do just that.
Unfortunately, it seems some of our statewide officials have decided that they simply can declare what the law is and we are all expected to follow. They did not learn the rule from kindergarten: just because you say something does not make it so.
In early December, more than 300,000 signatures were submitted to the Missouri Secretary of State’s Office to put the question of whether the state legislature’s mid-decade redistricting congressional map should be adopted. These Missourians spoke with a common voice, loud and clear, that they wanted a statewide vote, a right which is guaranteed to them by the Missouri Constitution.
The Missouri Constitution is quite clear on the referendum process, backed by more than a century of case law: the voters have a right to vote on legislation passed by the Missouri General Assembly, and the legislation in question takes effect only when approved by voters.
Previous secretaries of state and attorneys general, both Republican and Democratic, have followed the law, which was the case in 2017, when then Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft suspended the legislature’s “right to work” law when the required number of signatures were gathered to put the measure on the ballot.
Yet current Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, with the assistance of Attorney General Catherine Hanaway, has decided to ignore established precedent and black letter law by declaring that the law is not stopped until a vote of the people occurs, and instead the new map is now in effect. They are waving off the will of the hundreds of thousands of Missourians who signed the petition and attempting to thwart the ability of millions more to vote on the measure.
Hoskins should stop and consider what his job is. As part of his duties, he has the right to determine that the submitted signatures are insufficient, which is subject to a quick judicial review. He has not chosen to do this. What he does not have is the authority to decide which bill, will, or will not, get enacted into law pending the outcome of a vote of the people.
By choosing to simply declare the new map in effect, Hoskins and Hanaway are not only disregarding the law, they are sowing chaos. Both candidates and elected officials have no idea which congressional districts will be in effect. Furthermore, by this attempt to impose the maps by his will alone, they are further delaying the ability of the referendum process to move forward.
All of this undermines Missourians’ confidence in their democracy and damages both our legal and political systems.
Now Missouri voters have had to file a lawsuit just to require Hoskins and Hanaway to follow the law. This latest court battle is one of many that have been generated by the opposition of our statewide officials. It is disturbing our secretary of state and attorney general have dedicated so much time and taxpayer money to keep the people from having a voice. They need to respect that the more than 300,000 petition signers have spoken and asked for a vote regarding fair and equal representation in the United States Congress. They need to stop with the delaying tactics and support this right of voters.
The people of Missouri reserved the right in our state Constitution to have the final say over legislation. Hoskins cannot just wish that away.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/091025_rally3-1024x615.jpg,,,2026-01-07 06:58:13.856938

Barbara Dittrich (R-Oconomowoc) argued that a measure regulating the use of student names and pronouns was needed to standardize policies across the state. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)A bill that would require school districts to inform parents when students want to use pronouns and names that differ from the ones given to them at birth received significant pushback Tuesday during a Senate Education Committee hearing.
The committee also took testimony on a bill to add video requirements to human growth and development curriculum as well as to opt the state into a federal school choice tax credit program.
Under SB 120, Wisconsin schools would be required to adopt a policy on name and pronoun changes by July 1, 2026. Policies would not require written authorization if school staff are using a shortened version of a student’s first or middle name.
Sen. André Jacque (R-New Franken) and Rep. Barbara Dittrich (R-Oconomowoc) argued that the measure was needed to standardize policies across the state and ensure parents are involved in conversations related to pronoun and name changes for students. Many testified in opposition to the bill, saying it would do harm to students and infringe on local decision making. 
“It is deeply troubling to me that school staff are being encouraged to keep parents out of major life decisions concerning their children, while at the same time these same officials cannot give them aspirin without parental approval. Why would schools promote secrecy in such a way?” Jacque said. “Something has gone terribly wrong in our education system if officials inherently perceive parents as harmful to their own children. Parents are legally accountable for the health and welfare of their own children… Hiding from us important things that are going on in their lives is not only disrespectful to parents, it is harmful to our children.” 
Jacque said the legislation would be consistent with a 2023 ruling by a Waukesha County Circuit Court judge, which found that a policy that allowed students in the Kettle Moraine School District to change their names and pronouns in school violated the rights of parents to make medical decisions for their children. The school district now has a policy that requires express parental consent for staff to use different names and pronouns. 
“To me, if there’s going to be a name and pronoun change the school should be working together with parents and students to advance that together,” Dittrich said. 
Sen. Chris Larson (D-Milwaukee) pushed back on the Republican bill, saying it would infringe on local communities’ ability to make decisions about policies and would harm students.
“You could sub out the words ‘parental decision making’ and say that the Legislature is going to have the best authority of what should happen — instead of parents, instead of local governments, instead of local school boards. You’re saying that you guys know better,” Larson said. 
“That’s a total distortion of what the bill does,” Dittrich said.
Larson asked the bill authors to consider a situation where parents may not be accepting of a student who wants to use a different name and pronouns. 
“You are expediting that situation by making it come to a head when there are parents who are less than understanding, who are brought up under a very strict and very incorrect… and you are forcing the question in a vulnerable population that is already overly targeted with transphobia with this, which is already overly targeted for bullying, which is already higher than the average rates of suicide and mental health. You are bullying them by bringing this bill forward,” Larson said.
“You are saying we should hide information and not facilitate those conversations,” Jacque replied. Dittrich added that Larson was “trampling all over parental rights.”
Paul Bartlett, a father of two transgender children, said the bill works to “prioritize the unfounded fears of conservative parents over the well-being of children.” 
“Like any parent, I want my children to thrive and be happy. They are well supported against these continued legislative attacks, but many trans and nonbinary kids are not,” Bartlett said. He said that school should be a refuge for unsupported students, “not a place where teachers are obligated to out and humiliate them.” 
Bartlett pointed out that lawmakers recently approved a law, known as Bradyn’s Law, that seeks to protect young people from being sexually extorted online. 
“That everyone agreed on [that bill] was important because what we were doing was preventing teenagers from killing themselves basically from humiliation… and yet these bills, they do the opposite,” Bartlett said. 
Bartlett noted that anti-trans laws have a negative effect on young transgender people. 
According to a 2024 survey by the Trevor Project, 45% of transgender and nonbinary youth have reported that they or their family have considered moving to a different state due to anti-LGBTQ+ politics and laws, and about 90% have said that their wellbeing was negatively affected by  recent politics. 
The Trevor Project survey, which pulled from the experiences of over 18,000 LGBTQ+ youth, also found that 39% of LGBTQ+ young people, including 46% of transgender and nonbinary young people, had seriously considered attempting suicide. 
“I just don’t understand, like, why do we keep doing this?” Bartlett said.
Abigail Swetz, executive director of FAIR Wisconsin, said bills that target transgender youth contribute to the mental health struggles they face. 
The bill is part of a slate of bills that Wisconsin Republicans introduced related to transgender people, including children, last year. According to the 2025 anti-trans bills tracker, there were over 1,020 bills introduced across the country including 20 in Wisconsin. 
“Inclusive policies, like making it possible for students to use an affirming name and the pronouns that best represent their identity in school in an easily accessible way — those policies are a pressure valve making it possible for [youth] to live fully and healthily,” Swetz said. 
Swetz said when she previously worked as a teacher she helped support students that were preparing to share information about themselves with their family and said it was important to follow the child’s lead. 
“The youth themselves are the experts in their own experience and have a better understanding than anyone about the challenges they might face when it comes to acceptance and safety at home. I have witnessed that conversation go well, and I have seen it go badly,” Swetz said. She said the bill that lawmakers were pushing “aims to traffic in distrust while a process like this, one that is directed by a well-supported young person, is actually how we can build trust between parents, children and school staff.” 
Peggy Wirtz-Olson, president of the Wisconsin Education Association Council (WEAC), said she was speaking out against the bill on behalf of the students who would be “devastated” by the bill. 
“All students deserve safe and welcoming schools, not only some of them, every single one of them, and that includes our trans students,” Wirtz-Olsen said. “The simple use of preferred names and pronouns is associated with a large decrease in depressive symptoms, suicidal thoughts and even suicidal attempts. Respecting preferred names and pronouns is a proven measure to show respect, earn trust, affirm our students, so they can feel safe, and they can focus on learning.”
Requiring videos of fetal development
Lawmakers also took testimony on a bill to add requirements for schools that offer human growth and development education. 
Human growth and development is optional for Wisconsin school districts, but for those that do opt in, state law includes some requirements including encouraging abstinence for students who are unmarried. 
SB 371 would add requirements that explanations of pregnancy, prenatal development and childbirth include a high definition video that shows the development of the brain, heart, sex organs and other organs, a rendering of the fertilization process and fetal development as well as a presentation on each trimester of pregnancy and the physical and emotional health of the mother. 
The bill would also require that instruction on parental responsibility include information on the importance of secure interpersonal relationships for infant mental health and on the value of reading to young children. 
Bill coauthors Sen. Mary Felzkowski (R-Tomahawk) and Rep. Amanda Nedweski (R-Pleasant Prairie) rejected the assertion that the bill is a mandate, noting that school districts do not have to teach human growth and development. 
“Today’s youth are technologically and visually inclined learners. We should lean into this to better convey this important information,” Felzkowski said. She also added that there should be bipartisan agreement around “preparing the young women of today with all the knowledge they could need to prepare for motherhood and young men for fatherhood.” 
“Being able to actually see the real life process of fetal development in action will be more tangible to students than textbooks or seeing it in a still diagram or a drawing. We have a resource at our disposal to bring science into our classroom and we should use it to our advantage to give students a stronger educational experience,” Nedweski said.
Nedweski also said it “might not be obvious to some people that using an iPad as a babysitter is not healthy” and that it is “far more important for their health to read to children and to bond with them.”
Sen. Chris Larson (D-Milwaukee) asked the lawmakers what type of research they had to back up the change to state law.
“There’s not one specific scientific research that we’re relating this to,” Felzkowski said. “Just Google it and numerous things will pop up, or we can have our staff do that for you.”
No one spoke against the bill. 
The Wisconsin Public Health Association (WPHA) and the Wisconsin Association of Local Health Departments and Boards are registered against the bill, according to the Wisconsin Lobbying website. The organizations outlined their concerns with the Assembly version of the bill in a statement to the Wisconsin Examiner. 
The organizations said it opposed the legislation in part because it doesn’t do anything to restore the educational standards that were in place under the Healthy Youth Act. The former state law, which included a more comprehensive policy that required providing age-appropriate instruction in human growth and development, was adopted in 2010 but was later repealed in 2012 during a special session under former Gov. Scott Walker, who reestablished abstinence-only education. 
“Evidence-based, comprehensive instruction is essential to equip students with accurate information and skills necessary to make informed decisions about their sexual health, reducing rates of unintended pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections. It also promotes healthy relationships, consent, and emotional well-being, contributing to overall public health and safety,” the organizations said in the statement.
DPI spokesperson Chris Bucher told the Examiner in an email that the state already has similar guidelines for human development instruction in state law and said the bill is an example of infringing on local control. 
“It is up to districts to determine human development curriculum for what best fits their community. This is also another unfunded mandate for districts choosing to offer human development. District budgets are already stretched thin,” Bucher said. “If the Legislature wants to mandate specific instruction, they should provide funding for curriculum.”
Federal choice tax credit program 
SB 600 would instruct Gov. Tony Evers to opt Wisconsin into a federal school choice tax credit program.
Gov. Tony Evers has previously said he will not opt Wisconsin into the program, and if the bill were passed by the Senate and Assembly instructing Evers to take action, he could veto the legislation. 
A provision in the federal law signed by President Donald Trump in July, which goes into effect in 2027, will provide a dollar-for-dollar tax credit of up to $1,700 to people who donate to a qualifying “scholarship granting program” to support certain educational expenses including tuition and board at private schools, tutoring and books. 
However, governors in each state must decide whether to opt in and have until Jan. 1, 2027 to do so.
Felzkowski said it would be “shortsighted and self-defeating” to not opt into the tax credit, noting that other states including North Carolina, Tennessee, Nebraska, Texas, South Dakota and Iowa, are already opting in. 
If Wisconsinites opt into the federal tax credit, the money will be directed to private schools outside the state if the law does not pass, Felzkowski said. “Our dollars will be going to those states… instead of our students here in the state of Wisconsin.”

Vaneta Becker's legislation would criminalize doxing threats. She is pictured in the Senate chamber on Dec. 10, 2025. (Photo by Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana lawmakers hope to crack down on doxing after more than a dozen of their own became victims of threats amid a turbulent but unsuccessful redistricting campaign.
Doxing is the public release of someone’s personal information, without their consent, as a threat.
Senate Bill 140 would make that a Class A misdemeanor, or a felony if the doxing results in serious injury or death.
“Basically it’s what Sen. (Spencer) Deery and Sen. (Greg) Goode and Sen. (Jean) Leising and several others over the redistricting … experienced,” said bill author Sen. Vaneta Becker, R-Evansville, told the Senate’s Corrections and Criminal Law committee Tuesday.
Targeted lawmakers included those for and against President Donald Trump’s failed push to eliminate Indiana’s two Democratic congressional seats in favor of a 9-0 Republican delegation, ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.
As threats escalate against Indiana lawmakers, Braun says his family also targeted

The Indiana Senate voted the maps down mid-December, after months of intense pressure and weeks of threats.
Those included swatting attempts at lawmakers’ homes — hoax reports to emergency services intended to trigger armed responses — plus bomb threats and more.
“I was threatened to have my family killed in front of me, whereafter I would be killed,” redistricting bill author Rep. Ben Smaltz, R-Auburn, revealed mid-meeting last month.
Indiana State Police are leading an ongoing investigation into the intimidation against lawmakers.
While Tuesday’s discussion centered on lawmakers impacted during redistricting, everyday Americans are increasingly seeing their personal information spread across social media as retaliation for a wide range of disagreements.
Becker’s legislation would criminalize intentionally posting the personal information of a targeted person — or close connections — as a threat, in retaliation for something legal the targeted person did.
Personal information would include someone’s Social Security number, address or phone number, along with the name or address of their employer or places they frequent.
The definition for threat pulls from the state’s intimidation statute. Posts to social media would count, as would emails and other forms of electronic communication.
Tweaks to some of the bill’s definitions are expected.
Sen. Liz Brown, R-Fort Wayne, said the bill’s definition of a “closely connected” person was too vague. It would include the target’s spouse, sibling, child, parent and grandparent, but also an unrelated person living in the same household, a dating partner or a coworker.
Committee Chair Aaron Freeman, R-Indianapolis, assured her he would clarify the “broad” language in an amendment on Friday, before a vote on the bill.

“There’s a lot of benefit to people that disagree getting together and talking about it, and we do that all the time,” Freeman said later.
“How anybody is 45 years old, living in their mother’s basement and never having a relationship with anybody, and getting on a computer and doing this stuff? ” Freeman said. “… My God, can we be adults about this?”
He especially bemoaned the targeting of families with children.
The Class A misdemeanor created in Becker’s bill could rise to a Level 6 felony if a post results in serious bodily injury, or a Level 5 felony if it results in catastrophic injury or death.
Included are protections for those who make reports to law enforcement, prosecutors, and the Department of Child Services “reasonably and in good faith.”
The bill additionally appears to protect constituent communication and organizing, protecting those who engage in “lawful and constitutionally protected activity as it pertains to speech, assembly, and petition.”

A bill to change the unemployment insurance rules has divided lawmakers despite being offered by the joint labor-management Unemployment Insurance Advisory Council. (Wisconsin Examiner photo)A bill that would boost Wisconsin’s top weekly jobless pay while penalizing people who receive federal disability pay is heading to the Assembly floor — so far with only GOP support.
The legislation, AB 652, would also impose several previously vetoed changes to the state’s unemployment insurance (UI) law. It passed the Assembly’s labor committee Tuesday on a 6-3 vote, with all committee Democrats voting no.
The bill came from the Unemployment Insurance Advisory Council. With equal participation of labor and management, the council negotiates changes to the state’s unemployment insurance law every two years.
The council historically has been credited with giving neither side a lopsided advantage in revisions to the unemployment insurance system. The bill that the body offered for the current legislative session, however, has become problematic for some of the council’s staunchest advocates.

“I simply cannot vote for this particular bill as written,” said Rep. Christine Sinicki (D-Milwaukee) at Tuesday’s vote by the Assembly Committee on Workforce Development, Labor and Integrated Employment.
The measure would increase the maximum jobless pay for the first time in 12 years — to $395 a week from $370.
It would also formally repeal a 12-year-old ban on unemployment benefits for people who receive federal Social Security Disability Income. At the same time, however, it would cut an SSDI recipient’s jobless payments by the equivalent of half their weekly disability income.
A federal judge ruled in July 2024 that Wisconsin’s ban violated federal laws protecting people with disabilities.
In 2025 the judge ordered the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development to stop denying jobless pay for SSDI recipients. The department was also ordered to review the cases going back to 2015 of people denied unemployment insurance due to the ban and make payments to those who were otherwise eligible.
Sinicki has long championed the role of the UI advisory council in revising the state’s UI laws, criticizing changes Republicans have proposed that didn’t go through the joint labor-management body.
Despite that, she’s been an outspoken critic of the UI advisory council’s current bill since it was introduced in November, and reiterated her opposition Tuesday because of the SSDI penalty.
Sinicki described an autistic constituent who works “a few hours a day” at a library. “She counts on that money. If she loses that job, she’s out that money,” Sinicki said. “We’re talking about a very small amount of money. It’s not saving the state millions and millions of dollars” to claw it back.
She predicted the bill would run afoul of the court order blocking the SSDI ban.
Sinicki also criticized “the paltry $25 increase” in the maximum weekly benefit.
“When you look around at the states around us, most of them are paying out twice as much as we do here,” she said. “And I just think it’s a slap in the face.”
Rep. Paul Melotik (R-Grafton) chairs the Assembly Committee on Workforce Development, Labor and Integrated Employment. (Wisconsin Examiner photo)
State Rep. Paul Melotik (R-Grafton), the committee chair, defended the legislation.
“This is increasing what people are getting when they claim [unemployment],” Melotik said. “And it also is legal based on what the agreed-upon deal has been.”
In addition to its SSDI penalty, AB 652 would write into the state’s UI law changes that were in previous bills Gov. Tony Evers has vetoed — two of them in the current legislative session.
Those provisions would penalize unemployment insurance recipients accused of “ghosting” job interviews or failing to show up for an offered job; increase the scrutiny of recipients’ work searches; impose new requirements for applicants to prove their identities; and require DWD to follow specific steps, including checking databases that track death records, employment records, citizenship and immigration records, to confirm the identity of a UI applicant.
Evers’ office did not respond Tuesday to an inquiry about whether he planned to sign or veto the UI council legislation if it reaches his desk. In vetoing previous UI-related bills, Evers has cited in part the failure to put them through the advisory council process.
DWD, however, “has a number of concerns with the UIAC agreed upon bill package,” according to written testimony the department filed with the committee at a November public hearing on the bill.
Rachel Harvey, DWD’s legislative director, wrote that the bill’s $25 increase in the top weekly benefit from the maximum set in 2013 amounts to less than 7%. The increase “remains far below the maximum weekly benefit rate in neighboring states,” she wrote.
Harvey wrote that the testimony was provided “for information only,” but showed no enthusiasm for the legislation.
“The bill package includes reductions of Ul benefits for recipients of SSDI, multiple provisions previously vetoed by Gov. Evers, costly work search audit requirements, redundant measures already in effect at DWD to ensure program integrity, and new barriers for individuals receiving benefits,” she wrote
It makes those changes, she added, “all while failing to provide adequate resources for the department to implement these provisions in their entirety.”



Worker’s compensation changes get unanimous support
By contrast Tuesday, the Assembly committee unanimously endorsed legislation that would update Wisconsin’s worker’s compensation laws. That bill was also the product of a separate joint labor-management body, the The Worker’s Compensation Advisory Council.
AB 651 increases the maximum weekly compensation for a permanent, partial disability, currently $446, to $454 for workplace injuries before Jan. 1, 2027 and to $462 for injuries on or after that date.
It also increases supplemental benefits for permanent total disability. Those benefits had applied to people injured at work before Jan. 1, 2003, but the new bill extends them to cover workplace injuries before Jan. 1, 2020.
The legislation gives volunteer firefighters, emergency medical responders and emergency medical practitioners coverage for post-traumatic stress disorders that is in line with the coverage already available to law enforcement officers and non-volunteer firefighters.
The bill also makes numerous other procedural and administrative changes.

The kingdom of God is within, should we so choose, but not in the Capitol or the courthouse, writes columnist Rod Miller. 
The post Jesus, Jefferson and the separation of church and state appeared first on WyoFile .","When I hear anyone claim that separation of church and state doesn’t exist, and that the United States is a Christian nation, I have to chuckle at their lack of understanding. There are lots of Christian citizens, for certain, just as there are many Americans of other faiths. But we are not a Christian nation, nor were we founded to be a religious state.

Opinion

We were founded to be a nation in which all citizens are free to believe in any god they want, or to not believe. Emphasis on free.
The original 13 colonies were religious colonies to be sure, and there was no separation between church and state. But the First Amendment to our Constitution changed that forever.
Here’s an example. In the Virginia Colony in the mid-1700s, the Anglican Church was the official state religion. A Virginian could not hold public office unless he was a member of the state-sanctioned church.
The colony also levied taxes on all citizens, regardless of religion, that went directly to the Church of England clergy, to the church hierarchy and to support church property, a wealth transfer that the Wyoming Constitution strictly prohibits today.
State and church were so intertwined that colonial government enforced church law. Heresy was a capital crime under colonial law. If a Virginian disagreed with Anglican Church doctrine, or bad-mouthed the Archbishop of Canterbury, it was the colony that prosecuted and punished the offense because church and state were virtually the same entity.
Those church laws were not voted upon by the citizens, but were handed down by clerics who were themselves not elected. Yet, citizens, regardless of denomination, were punished if they did not obey those laws. When there is no separation of church and state, that is what citizens can expect.
Thomas Jefferson came of age under Virginia’s repressive church/state thumb. When he was elected to the Virginia General Assembly, he drafted and passed the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom in 1786, a year before our Constitution was drafted.

Columnist Rod Miller.(Mike Vanata)

The Virginia Statute was an Enlightenment Age document and clearly expressed the primacy of human freedom over religious dogma. Under that secular law, all people were free to express their religious beliefs without interference from the state. All religious beliefs, not just Christianity, were liberated from state control. It was among the first expressions of the separation between church and state in human history.
And it was the model for James Madison’s First Amendment.
This is the constitutional framework that exists today, regardless of what Christian nationalists or hair-on-fire mercantile evangelists preach. Human spirituality is free from the greedy hands of the political state. What is Caesar’s is rendered unto Caesar, and what is God’s is rendered unto God. That’s regardless of what God is worshiped or which political party holds power.
The First Amendment, in fact, the very first part of it, guarantees government cannot establish a religion or prevent anyone from practicing their own religion. That guarantee leaves no room for government in the world of faith, and vice versa. It is a clear separation.
In the United States, under our Constitution, religion is free of government control and government is free of religious control. I would have it no other way.
Absent that separation, theocracies emerge where governments impose and enforce religious laws, as in countries subject to Sharia Law, on all of the citizens. And governments are free to engage in bloody atrocities like the Spanish Inquisition or the Crusades to force their religious belief on others.
A jaundiced view of things might conclude that this is the intent of the politically active religious zealots in today’s America. If so, it runs counter to everything this country was founded upon.
To avoid any misunderstanding, I’ll testify here and now that I believe in God and love Jesus as much as anyone. But I’ll resist any attempt by my government to force me to believe or tell me how to worship. Nor will I try to force the same on anyone else.
Both a life of faith and a decision not to believe are deeply personal and individual choices, and our system of government protects our right to choose. Realistically, no law can be written that will force the innermost human heart to believe, not to believe or how to believe. That is simply not government’s dominion.
Jesus himself articulated this separation of church and state best in Luke 17:21 when he told the Pharisees, “The kingdom of God is within you.”
It is not in the courthouse, nor in the Capitol building, the kingdom of God is within you. Thank you, Jesus and Jefferson for drawing that clear line!

Tim Walz announces he will step down from the 2026 gubernatorial election Monday, Jan. 5, 2026 at the Minnesota State Capitol. (Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)The moment Gov. Tim Walz was cooked was little remarked upon at the time, but in retrospect illustrates how he and his administration were sleeping through an enveloping crisis.
At the late 2024 budget forecast, he said disability and autism services were driving state government spending beyond expectations. When he was asked about potential fraud in the autism program — about which we’d reported an FBI investigation six months prior — he seemed unfamiliar. I traded texts with an incredulous reporter who was there and wound up publishing a column called, “Minnesota: an easy mark.” 
More recently, Walz faced the full force of the right-wing propaganda machine in the past two months. It was a frightening sight to behold, and a healthier democracy would never be host to such a parasitical malignancy.
Although restoring American democratic habits of mind to eviscerate that propaganda machine should be on our lengthy, long-term to-do list, the lesson here for me is that the most underrated tool in the political toolbox is … governing.
Deadly dull, I know, but the word governor even has the word “govern” in it: competently administering programs to help people who need it; ensuring Minnesota’s children are learning literacy and numeracy; and managing the state’s vast infrastructure assets. That’s the job.
Former St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter, another one-time rising star in Minnesota politics, recently faced the same sort of governing reckoning as Walz, when Mayor Kaohly Her pulled off an upset November victory promising to make stuff work again. May Democratic elected officials everywhere take notice.
We live in perilous times, no question, but Minnesotans are right to expect a minimum level of competency in these matters of public administration. It’s especially important for the party of government, i.e., the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, to pay attention to details, like whether a 3,000% increase in spending on the autism program is reasonable, especially when some of the providers had ties to Feeding Our Future.
Tim Walz is at heart a decent man, and he doesn’t deserve what’s been thrown at him in recent weeks — especially a despicable allegation leveled by the president of the United States and the odious propagandist Nick Shirley that Walz was involved in the assassination of former House Speaker Melissa Hortman.
He made some mistakes, but he’s not evil, unlike some of the loudest and most influential voices in American politics today, whose greed and lust for power are boundless.
Walz’s first term was marked by almost constant crisis, none of it his doing. He was a mostly steady hand, even as Republicans came to despise him during the pandemic and the aftermath of the police murder of George Floyd.
His second term comprised major legislative accomplishments — for which the credit mostly belongs to Hortman and the late Sen. Kari Dziedzic — as well as his (again, in retrospect) disastrous candidacy for vice president. All the while, thieves were stealing the people’s money with gusto.
Walz has served the community of Mankato, the people of Minnesota and his country.
And now he has saved us from what would have been a deeply divisive campaign, and which would have put the state of Minnesota under federal siege.
Unlike former President Joe Biden, who doomed his party and the country with his insistence on running for a second term, Walz is stepping aside before any more damage is done to his state and the DFL. He says he’ll focus all his energies on cleaning up the mess.
He deserves our thanks for that service and for making this decision.

(Photo: Christine Zhu/NC Newsline)One of the biggest topics of 2025 for farmers, consumers and healthcare providers in North Carolina was whether raw milk should be legal to sell for human consumption. The battle, which  has been going on for years, could well resurface during the 2026 legislative session.
Raw milk has not undergone pasteurization, which is a process of heating the milk to a high temperature for a certain amount of time to kill pathogens like tuberculosis, which for centuries was frequently caused by drinking milk from cows with tuberculosis.   
Public health officials say foodborne illnesses like salmonella can also spread through consuming unpasteurized milk. Symptoms of these can include vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. They can be especially severe in children.
Some people, however, say raw milk is healthier — a theory that’s been debunked by hundreds of studies — or that it tastes better. Others argue it’s an issue of personal liberty, claiming consumers have a fundamental freedom to decide what they and their families consume.  
Robert Benor owns Benor Farm in Cedar Grove, N.C. (Christine Zhu/NC Newsline)
Robert Benor owns Benor Farm in Orange County’s Cedar Grove, a regenerative dairy with 12 cows and a herdshare.
Herdsharing is a practice similar to a CSA or farmshare, but it’s specific to dairy products. Consumers who want raw milk can buy a “share” of a dairy herd’s production, which sidesteps the legal issues over selling the milk itself. 
Benor says some of his customers have moved here from other states where the sale of raw milk is legal. “[They] say they can’t get used to the taste of pasteurized milk,” he said. “There’s others who are all natural and prefer raw milk.”
The cows, each bearing the name of something that goes with milk — for example, Milkshake, Nutmeg, Chocolate Chip, and Biscuit — live on the pasture at Benor Farm year round.
The number of herdshare members fluctuates throughout the year, but Benor says he provides raw milk to roughly a few hundred families and individuals. He also offers add-ons like butter, ricotta, yogurt, heavy cream, and fresh eggs from his chickens.

Benor milks the dairy cows every morning, sanitizing the equipment and storing the milk in a bulk tank that’s cleaned every 72 hours. 
“We focus a lot on sanitation and hygiene, so that we can make sure the milk is as safe as possible,” Benor told NC Newsline. 
But even the best sanitation can’t remove pathogens from unpasteurized milk -– a fact Davidson resident Pamela Breeckner knows from personal experience.
Breeckner told NC Newsline her father passed away years ago from tuberculosis contracted from drinking raw milk from a neighbor’s diseased cow. At the time, dangers related to unpasteurized milk weren’t as well known, and there were fewer regulations on its sale and consumption. 
“He was hospitalized or homebound for about 12 years before his death,” Breeckner said. “He was ill my whole life.”
The cow’s owners also passed away from tuberculosis, she said.
North Carolina Agriculture Commissioner Steve Troxler is in favor of banning the sale of raw milk outright. He said the topic has been an ongoing issue for many years. Recent outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza — a very infectious strain of bird flu — led to the latest push to ban raw milk. 
Bird flu has moved from wild birds and poultry to farm animals like dairy cattle. From there, it can spread to humans, leading to conditions like respiratory symptoms and pinkeye.
As of Dec. 17, a total of 71 human cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza have been identified in the U.S. since 2024, according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology. 
“[There were] dangers that had existed in the past, especially with bacterial growth in raw milk,” Troxler said. “But then when you throw in high-path avian influenza, then that is a different ball game.”
The controversial issue took the spotlight in North Carolina during debate over the state’s 2025 Farm Act, which passed the Senate and stalled in the House. 
An earlier draft of the bill would have closed the “pet milk” loophole in state law that allows the sale of unpasteurized milk. Under current law, the sale of raw milk for human consumption is illegal, but it can legally be sold as “pet milk” for animal consumption. 
The measure was ultimately pulled from the bill because of protests from raw milk advocates. About 100 activists attended a hearing of the North Carolina Senate Judiciary Committee in May, one of whom was arrested for attempting to bring a gun into the meeting.
Bill sponsor Sen. Brent Jackson, a Republican from Sampson County, said at that hearing he’d received thousands of text messages, phone calls, and emails in favor of raw milk consumption in North Carolina. 
“Until we filed this bill, sometimes you don’t know what’s out there,” he said. “But I’ve learned there is a tremendous amount of herdsharing going on in this state.”
Sampson did not allow the public to comment on the bill that day. But the committee voted against a total ban on the sale of raw milk.
Jackson’s staff did not respond to NC Newsline’s request for comment. 
Troxler isn’t giving up, though. He points to research like a 2017 study showing that unpasteurized dairy products can cause 840 times more illnesses and 45 times more hospitalizations than pasteurized products.
“From a public health standpoint, there is no reason to take that risk of contracting these illnesses when all you’ve got to do is have pasteurized milk,” Troxler told NC Newsline.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0630-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-07 06:12:45.684998

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)A Tennessee Senate panel wants officers at a privately-run prison rocked by a 2025 riot to wear body cameras despite opposition from the state’s correction commissioner.
The State and Local Government Corrections Subcommittee recommended a pilot program Tuesday for the state’s private-prison contractor, CoreCivic, to equip detention officers at Trousdale Turner Correctional Center with body cameras in an effort to protect officers and inmates and provide clearer evidence for criminal investigations.
State Sen. Ed Jackson of Jackson pointed out that prisons can be “extremely dangerous” because of a shortage of prison officers.
“Body cameras would keep everybody honest,” Jackson said.
CoreCivic President and CEO Patrick Swindle estimated the cost of putting cameras on Trousdale Turner officers at $350,000. 
Senators surmised that CoreCivic was willing to pay for the hardware, but a spokesperson said afterward the company hadn’t agreed to fund the equipment, only that it would work with the state on the policies it adopts.
Correction Commissioner Frank Strada, though, balked at the notion of putting body cameras on every prison officer in the state, saying it would cost $6 million for the equipment and $2 million to handle public records requests, including the expense of hiring attorneys and technology specialists to go through video frame by frame and blur people’s faces for privacy reasons. He did not have a cost estimate for a pilot project at Trousdale Turner.

Instead, Strada told lawmakers the Department of Correction is putting together a central intelligence center in Nashville with nearly 30 employees using artificial intelligence to monitor prisoners. The department’s proposed budget for fiscal 2026-27 includes $8.6 million for technology upgrades.
The department also plans to spend $1.7 million to fly drones over facilities to stop contraband and phones from being smuggled into prisons. 
Strada raised privacy questions about video surveillance, mainly the constitutionality of having officers and inmates on video in cells, restrooms and other areas.
Lawmakers and a state attorney, though, said inmates lose some of their privacy rights when sent to prison.
Correction officials and CoreCivic leaders also challenged the concept of keeping body cameras turned on at all times, saying the amount of video is overwhelming for those who would monitor it or search for incidents. 
Swindle told lawmakers the company uses body cams at an Ohio prison but changed policy to allow officers to activate them only when they sense the need rather than keeping them on at all times.
Strada and a Correction Department lawyer also advised lawmakers the cost of hiring attorneys and technology experts would be extensive if cameras are rolling throughout an officer’s shift.
Lawmakers based their decision, in part, on the testimony of Wilson County District Attorney Jason Lawson, whose office handles Trousdale County cases, including those at the prison. 
U.S. Department of Justice opens investigation into CoreCivic Trousdale County prison

Lawson told the committee body cameras would help with prosecution of prison cases by providing better evidence. He showed pictures of inmates attacking an officer at Trousdale and explained that cameras in the prison’s pods are located at each end of a hall and when video is enlarged it doesn’t give a clear look at people’s faces to identify them in court.
“This is one of those situations where a picture is worth a thousand words,” Lawson said.
Swindle told lawmakers that CoreCivic invested in safety and security measures and increased officers’ pay, which reduced vacancies and cut the turnover rate. In addition, the state moved gang members out of Trousdale Turner to state-run prisons.
A Trousdale Turner officer was stabbed and three inmates were treated for injuries in June 2025 when prisoners left their cells and gained access to an inner yard, destroyed property, set small fires and refused to take orders from staff.
The U.S. Department of Justice initiated a civil rights investigation at Trousdale Turner in 2024, citing a record of assaults, murders and understaffing at the facility since it opened in 2016. It is unclear whether the investigation is continuing.
The Department of Correction is seeking a $13 million contract increase for CoreCivic next year that would push the company’s total contracts to $243 million for running four prisons. The department also wants $3.5 million to go toward an increase in CoreCivic’s officer pay.

Officials with the Wood River Land Trust announced Dec. 30 they were part of a large, community effort to acquire the 2,700-acre Hailey Hot Springs Ranch for permanent conservation. 
The ranch, which was once the site of the historic Hailey Hot Springs Hotel in the 1800s, adds to the Hailey Greenway, a 3,000-acre, six mile stretch of protected land, officials said. 
“When the For Sale sign went up at the property, people were coming to us hoping that we could do something,” Wood River Land Trust Executive Director Amy Trujillo said in a written statement. “We knew it was going to take more than one organization to make this happen. Again and again over the course of the year, we have been amazed at the way people have come together – it’s a testament to how much people love this place and what we can do together.”
 Wood River Land Trust will now work to develop master plan for property

In its announcement, the Wood River Land Trust said more than 900 partners teamed up to acquire and protect the property. The list includes The Nature Conservancy, Blaine County Recreation District, Heart of the Rockies Initiative, Atira Conservation, 100 Men Who Care, the Wood River Women’s Foundation, Hailey Rotary Club, Spur Community Foundation, the Idaho Fish and Wildlife Foundation, The Rixon-Cronin Charitable Trust, Power Engineers, the Kid Stand charitable initiative and numerous families. 
In 2025, officials with the Wood River Land Trust had announced they launched a campaign to raise $16 million to buy the property.

With the property acquisition complete, officials with the Wood River Land Trust said they will begin working on a master plan for the property and anticipate seeking public comment and involvement in developing the master plan in the spring. 
Supporters are seeking to protect wildlife habitat for sage grouse, moose, mule deer, pronghorn, sandhill cranes and elk on the land, as well as preserve public access, the Wood River Land Trust said. 
“Protecting Hailey Hot Springs Ranch has been the top priority of the Land Trust since its founding by community members over 30 years ago,” officials with the Wood River Land Trust wrote in a press release Dec. 30. “The acquisition adds to the Hailey Greenway, which is now a 3,000‐acre, six‐mile stretch of connected open space encompassing the Colorado Gulch Preserve, Draper Wood River Preserve, Simons/Bauer Preserve, and the new Hailey Hot Springs Ranch Preserve. The protected land now extends through riverfronts and riparian forests, wetlands, sagebrush steppe, and high-desert alpine ecosystems, where it links with thousands of acres of public land beyond.”
  Plans call for reopening Hailey Hot Springs to the public 

Although there is public access to the ranch, access to the hot springs itself remains closed for now, officials said. However, officials with the Wood River Land Trust said their plans call for reopening the hot springs to the public.

“An exciting part of this project is the opportunity to reopen public access to the hot springs,” the Wood River Land Trust said in its press release. “The springs are located in a sensitive area, and the land trust and the Blaine County Recreation District will be developing a plan to provide a long-term solution that provides safe and accessible hot spring access for the public away from the sensitive wildlife area. Thus, for now, the hot spring will remain closed to the public until that can be developed.”
Access to the ranch is available via Democrat Gulch Road, which is surrounded by Bureau of Land Management and U.S. Forest Service public land, officials said.",https://idahocapitalsun.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/12-Wood-River-Land-Trust-Summit-of-Hailey-Hot-Springs-Ranch-looking-out-toward-Pioneer-Mtns-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-07 06:12:45.684998

No more “World News Tonight.” No “Dancing With the Stars.” The “9-1-1” drama franchises gone, all of them. And no – clutch the pearls – SEC football on Saturday afternoons.
Then imagine if folks at Sinclair told unhappy viewers that if they wanted to keep watching ABC, they could just stream it. And that they should be satisfied with a grab bag of less expensive programming filling the gaping holes in its schedule.
Ridiculous, you say. But that’s exactly what might happen at Arkansas PBS, where the installation of former Republican state legislator Carlton Wing as executive director has resulted in the inexplicable decision to drop its PBS affiliation and rebrand as something called Arkansas TV, which few people will watch and even fewer people will support financially.
The state of Arkansas has spent 60 years and tens of millions of dollars building a public television network with statewide reach, one of the gems of our media landscape. But starting in July, programs from PBS – which make up the bulk of the content now available on the network’s four channels – will no longer be broadcast in the state. Arkansas is the first state in the union to make that move.
No more “PBS News Hour.” No “Sesame Street.” No “Antiques Roadshow.” No “American Experience,” or Ken Burns documentaries. The PBS KIDS channel – which provides vital educational programming serving lower-income households that lack high-speed internet access needed to stream content – will go dark at the whim of Wing, who has no background in public broadcasting.
The disaffiliation, easily ratified by the Arkansas Educational Television Commission now packed with Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ appointees, was one of the first moves Wing took after leaving the Legislature to take the helm of Arkansas PBS in September.
His reasoning? At $2.3 million a year, PBS programming is just too expensive because a different pack of Republican ideologues in Congress dismembered the Corporation for Public Broadcasting that underwrote the cost – an excuse that quickly dissolves when subjected to even slight scrutiny.
The notion that we can’t possibly find $2.3 million for a resource that serves 3 million Arkansans, at a cost of just 77 cents per resident per year, is rather laughable in a state now frittering away $300 million a year on voucher subsidies for private and homeschool students, a program that serves fewer than 47,000 families.
Rather than reaching out to wealthy donors to fill the gap, or seeking funding from charitable foundations, or finding more corporate underwriting, or lobbying for additional state funding, or even pushing Arkansas’ congressional delegation to reverse the decision to whack federal funding, Wing simply threw in the towel. It’s a move that was both lazy and unimaginative.
Disaffiliating from PBS should have been an absolute last resort when all other options had failed.
Contrast this with the approach of Arkansas’ three public radio stations, all of which also lost CPB support and none of which decided to drop NPR content. Indeed, they are working hard to find additional long-term, sustainable financial support to make up the gap.
Wing has said the disaffiliation decision had to be made now to avoid paying additional fees to PBS for not meeting a Jan. 1 deadline. PBS officials deny that claim, and it also ignores the fact that there would be no rationale at all for disaffiliation if other options had been successfully pursued.
Indeed, Arkansas PBS viewers showed their passion and commitment by coughing up $500,000 in the months after Congress cut CPB funding – an outpouring of support Wing has extinguished with his short-sighted decision to disaffiliate.
Wing ignores the effect this decision will have on the $3 million raised each year from viewers like you (more than the amount that he’s saving by eliminating PBS) that’s going to vanish like an Arkansas snowstorm.
Marge Betley, CEO of the Arkansas PBS Foundation, which manages donations to the network, made this point in June when she said that donations would “nosedive” without PBS because 80% of those who donate online cite its programming as their reason for giving money. The telethons that generate many of these donations are also, literally, built around PBS programming because these are the shows viewers care about and watch.
And here is where we truly go through the looking glass: Arkansas TV is telling current donors who get access to expanded content through the PBS Passport app that if they want to keep it, they will need to donate to PBS stations in surrounding states.
Thus, we are now actively encouraging money to flow out of Arkansas to support out-of-state stations. And if Wing thinks these people are also going to donate to Arkansas TV, he’s lost touch with reality.
The other aspect of this scheme is Wing’s pledge to raise the amount of locally produced programming on the network from its current level – about 5.5% of the schedule – to 70%.
Arkansas TV insists that it can replace hours and hours of PBS programming with local content for just $500,000 a year. But a budget that meager won’t come anywhere close to producing the quantity or quality of content that PBS viewers and donors have come to expect.
This decision is the culmination of a long-term Republican project, dating back to the Reagan years, to dismantle public broadcasting. This dismantling is pushed by politicians who oppose the very idea of having even one tiny, government-supported, non-commercial voice, or who believe PBS programming is too “liberal” or “woke.” 
Republicans in Congress, including Arkansas’ entire delegation, voted to put Arkansas PBS’ head on the block. Wing has now wielded the axe. Viewers will flee, fundraising will dry up, and Arkansas TV will become an irrelevant white elephant. Arkansas will be poorer for it.
Wing’s folly was perhaps best summed up in a letter sent to him by Annette Herrington, who has served on the Arkansas PBS board for 14 years and voted against disaffiliation:
“There are multiple options for how to proceed because that is what public television systems are doing all over America. And with 78% of Arkansans supporting PBS content, viewers and donors definitely deserve our best efforts to find a solution for the people we serve,” she wrote. “I cannot understand how the only option presented after your first 70 days was to deny PBS content to all Arkansans.”

Shortly after launching a dramatic raid in which U.S. forces abducted Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro on Saturday, President Donald Trump justified the action with a promise to revive Venezuela’s moribund oil industry. The country has by far the largest claimed reserves of crude oil in the world, accounting for almost a fifth of the planet’s remaining known crude oil, but its production has plummeted under Maduro, who has ruled the country since 2013.
“We’re going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure, and start making money for the country,” Trump said during a press conference at Mar-a-Lago in which he announced Maduro’s capture.
This intervention comes at a pivotal moment for the global oil industry, which continues to stare down the prospect of a broad transition to renewable energy. For this reason, it’s not obvious that future markets can justify a surge of investment in Venezuela. On one hand, the country’s extra-heavy crude oil is perfect for diesel and jet fuel, which are helpful in hard-to-decarbonize industries. This makes it less threatened by the meteoric rise of electric vehicles displacing gasoline-powered cars. On the other hand, the world is already experiencing an overall glut of oil, and analysts expect demand to peak in the next decade. While there are buyers for additional oil that could be pumped in Venezuela — some of them on the U.S. Gulf Coast — experts say a total revival on the order that Trump is promising may not be in the cards.
“There’s a guaranteed market for it, but a market that has its limitations in size,” said Antoine Halff, the founder of the climate and data analysis firm Kayrros and a nonresident fellow at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy.
As electric vehicles and renewable energy continue to expand, the world appears to be approaching a peak in oil demand. While the exact timing of that peak is disputed — it could happen within four years or in more than 15 years — almost all analysts agree that it is coming. At that point, there may no longer be sufficient demand to keep exploiting new oil fields, no matter how large. And given that it will take many years just to update the infrastructure that will allow for increased oil production in Venezuela in the first place, investors may decide that the juice is not worth the squeeze.
Then there’s the matter of predicting future prices in a notoriously volatile industry. Oil companies only make a profit when global oil prices stay above a certain level. For the U.S. companies that produce oil from Texas shale, for example, that number is around $60 a barrel, which is close to the current benchmark price. For Saudi Arabia, it’s closer to $90 a barrel, because oil revenues back almost all the kingdom’s government spending. In the newest oil fields, such as those offshore of Guyana, it’s as low as $30. There are already concerns that an oversupply of oil worldwide could send prices tumbling over the next year, making new fields less palatable to investors. If demand plateaus, a surge of Venezuelan crude would push prices even further down. Since Venezuela is a member of OPEC, it would have to coordinate production along with Saudi and other major producers, who would likely prevent Venezuela from flooding the market.
Even so, there will likely be long-term demand for the specific kind of oil that Venezuela produces. That’s because any energy transition will not happen at equal speed across all parts of the transportation sector. The expansion of electric vehicles will first replace passenger cars and mopeds, which rely on lighter oil from fields like those of the Texas shale. Larger vehicles like airplanes and heavy-duty trucks are harder to replace — they need more power than EV batteries can feasibly provide at present — and they rely on heavy oil like Venezuela’s. A report from the oil trading firm Vitol found that “the initial pace of decline [for diesel] is expected to be slow compared to gasoline, but begins to gather pace from 2035 onwards.” Few other countries boast the same kind of extra-heavy reserves that Venezuela has, and those that do, like Canada, have much higher production costs.
“These are the hard-to-abate segments,” said Halff. “It’s the part of oil demand that looks like it’s not going to shrink quickly.”
Venezuela pumped more than 3 million barrels of oil per day at the turn of the century, but production totals have plummeted since then. After the government of Hugo Chávez nationalized major oil infrastructure in 2007, the United States imposed financial sanctions that forced Venezuela to sell its oil at steep discounts. Under the Maduro government, the state-owned oil company racked up debts and saw an exodus of skilled workers. Pumps and pipelines decayed out of service, storage tanks collapsed, and production bottomed out at around 500,000 barrels per day during the COVID-19 pandemic.
President Trump has promised that his aggressive raid on Venezuela will lead to a revival of this industry, and he has reportedly urged U.S. oil producers to aid him in the effort. In remarks following the Maduro raid, he promised that American companies would return to Venezuela and help export oil to other countries. Given how inefficient the state-run oil sector has become, analysts believe it would be easy to restore some production in the short term with outside investment and sanctions relief.
“Our assumption is that there are a lot of wells that just need a workover,” said Adrian Lara, the lead analyst for the Latin American oil industry at the research firm Wood Mackenzie, in a brief published last month before Maduro’s capture. “You can boost production through opex [operational expenditure], without needing much new capex [capital expenditure]” — in other words, a tune-up rather than a full surge of new investment.
In the short term, there is ample demand. The oil in the country’s vast Orinoco Belt is very heavy and viscous, like molasses, in contrast to U.S. shale oil, which is about as thin as vinegar. This makes it more expensive and more carbon-intensive to produce, but also makes it well suited for conversion into diesel fuel in trucks and for other uses like asphalt. There are several refineries along the Gulf Coast that were built to process this kind of heavy crude, and these refineries are operating below capacity. Right now, Venezuela exports most of its oil to China, which would also likely purchase more for its own refineries. An industry expert who spoke to The Wall Street Journal said access to those reserves could be a “game changer” in terms of increasing Gulf Coast refiners’ profits.
“Right now there’s plenty of appetite for heavy crude globally,” said Robert Auers, a refined fuels market analyst at the energy consultancy RBN Energy. “Even if Venezuelan production were to come back real strong, the global market could easily absorb that.”
But a grand revival like the one Trump has promised would be a much taller order, given that it would take decades to unfold. The energy analysis firm Rystad Energy projects that a return to pre-Maduro levels would require an investment of $110 billion, and these investments would not bear fruit for a decade or more. Even Chevron, the only U.S. oil producer that operates in the country, would need to invest an estimated $7 billion in order to add another 500,000 barrels, according to a former executive who spoke with The New York Times.
The climate pollution stemming from this crude might also play a factor in its market appeal. Right now, the heavy oil extraction in the Orinoco Belt is some of the most carbon-intensive in the world, in part because enormous amounts of methane are flared during the process. As governments continue to pursue Paris Agreement targets, however fitfully, they might shy away from such fields wherever possible and instead import lower-carbon barrels. (The European Union has already committed to do this.) Many experts believe that oil majors will hesitate before taking the plunge on a resource that is far tougher to handle than the crude in U.S. shale fields or the Middle East.
That’s all in addition to the political uncertainty that has followed Trump’s attempt to depose Maduro. It remains unclear what shape the new government of Venezuela will take. Given that other producers like Exxon Mobil lost billions of dollars when the Chávez government nationalized their assets, it’s far from obvious that these oil companies would want to invest under continued political instability. Past U.S. interventions have demonstrated similar dynamics: Oil production in Libya has still not recovered since the fall of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, and it took almost a decade for Iraqi oil production to rebound after the U.S. invaded in 2003.
“I do not believe in a significant increase in the short term,” said Rudolf Elias, chair of the supervisory board of Staatsolie, the state oil company of Suriname, which is pursuing an offshore oil project in the waters east of Venezuela. “It will take years before the industry is revived … then it is dirty oil, and heavy, so it will not be first in the row.”

(Photo by Julie O'Donoghue/LAI)More than half of adults in Louisiana have experienced physical violence during their lifetime but what those acts look like largely depends on the victim’s gender, according to an annual survey conducted last year. 
In Louisiana, gun violence is much more likely to be carried out against men, while severe  intimate partner violence — sometimes referred to as domestic abuse — is much more likely to happen to women, showed the result of a study by Tulane University, the University of California San Diego and the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago.
“Violence is a gendered issue. It is different if you are a man or a woman or a boy or a girl,” Anita Raj, executive director of the Newcomb Institute at Tulane University and the study’s lead author, said in an interview. 
Raj’s survey, the Louisiana Study on Violence Experiences Across the Lifespan, is the only comprehensive research of its kind conducted in the state. It was administered online in English and Spanish between May 13 and June 18, 2025, to more than 1,000 Louisiana residents 18 and older. 
The survey shows Louisiana residents experience violence at an alarmingly high rate. Eight percent of people surveyed said they were subjected to physical violence in the past year, including 3% who said they were threatened with either a knife or a gun.

Who commits the violence and what form it takes largely depends on the victim’s gender. 

Over half of women (58%) who had experienced physical violence within a year of the survey reported their spouse or partner were responsible for the incidents, compared with just 14% of men. Most men (53%) who had experienced physical violence in that time period said they were targeted by a stranger, compared with just 5% of women, according to the report. 
Men were much more likely to be subjected to gun violence than women, however; 4% of men reported they had been threatened or attacked with a gun in the year before the survey was taken, compared with just 1% of women, according to the report.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Yet women (13%) were more likely to experience sexual harassment and sexual violence than men (6%). Almost one in four women (23%) surveyed also said they had been subjected to forced sex during their lifetimes, compared with 7% of men. 
Severe intimate partner violence, sometimes called domestic violence, was also much more prevalent for women. 

Almost 25% of women reported they had been subjected to potentially lethal forms of intimate partner violence — such as choking, suffocation, burns, beatings and use of a weapon — during their lifetimes. Only 6% of men reported being the victims of life-threatening violence from a spouse or dating partner. 
Mariah Wineski, executive director of the Louisiana Coalition Against Domestic Violence, said the study’s findings align with what domestic violence shelters and other victim advocacy groups see on a daily basis. 

“Many times, the most dangerous place for a woman is in her home or in her relationship,” Wineski said. 

Intimate partner violence is more widespread among younger people. Twelve percent of respondents who are 18-24 years old and 15% of those ages 25-34 experienced violence and controlling behavior from a partner in the year before the survey was taken. Only 1-2% over people 55 and older reported the same problem. 
Raj and Wineski said prevention programs aimed at reducing intimate partner violence need to start with adolescents in order to have the greatest impact. 
“It is much more effective to change the attitudes and beliefs of a child or adolescent,” Wineski said. “They are at a better place in their lives for learning all sorts of new things, including how to interact with other people.”
Programs that promote economic stability and lift people out of poverty also help curb violence, according to Raj’s report. 
Survey participants who reported not having enough money for food or other basic necessities were five times more likely to have experienced physical violence in the past year and six times more likely to experience intimate partner violence.

From the newsroom of the U.S. Senate Finance Committee: “U.S. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo, R-Idaho., and Ranking Member Ron Wyden, D-Ore., recently introduced the Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM) Price Transparency and Accountability Act to fix market distortions and increase transparency in federal prescription drug programs to lower patient costs at the pharmacy counter.”
This is a bipartisan attempt to bring down the costs of prescription medications for patients in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
As background, manufacturers do not set the final price of their drugs. Pharmaceutical pricing goes through a series of steps before drugs actually reach patients. Depending on whether people buy their prescription drugs directly from a pharmacy or through their insurance, several transactions and multiple layers of profit are built into the system.
In general, manufacturers sell to wholesalers who then sell to pharmacies. Most, if not all, insurance companies use pharmacy benefit managers to negotiate the best pricing from manufacturers. Drug wholesalers and Pharmacy Benefit Managers provide a service, but this comes at an added cost to the consumer.
Wholesalers and Pharmacy Benefit Managers will argue that they obtain better prices from manufacturers, but these contracts and the supposed benefits are not transparent. Actual contract pricing and rebates are usually closely guarded and not readily available to the public
What is known is that Pharmacy Benefit Manager companies, in general, have higher profit margins than drug manufacturers. Drug wholesalers and pharmaceutical benefit managers may have a role in the drug market, but only if they add value for patients. Their contracts and pricing should be transparent, so consumers can decide the amount of value added.
According to the U.S. Senate Finance Committee’s press release, the PBM Price Transparency and Accountability Act would:

“Delink PBM compensation from their negotiated rebates to disincentivize PBMs from promoting higher-priced medications;
Increase PBM reporting requirements to Medicare Part D plan sponsors and to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and empower Part D plan sponsors to audit their PBM for compliance with contract requirements;
Reinforce existing requirements that plan sponsors contract with any willing pharmacy that meets their standard contract terms and conditions to better protect independent pharmacies in rural areas from practices that have contributed to widespread closures;
Require participation by retail community pharmacies in the National Average Drug Acquisition Cost (NADAC) survey, which would ensure accurate Medicaid payments to pharmacies; and
Mandate PBMs pass Medicaid payments directly to pharmacies to ensure transparent drug costs for states and taxpayers.”

The lack of price knowledge in our health care system is a fundamental problem for patients who want to make informed medical decisions. The Senate Finance Committee is to be congratulated for attempting to make Pharmacy Benefit Managers responsible for holding down pharmaceutical costs.
Hopefully, the full Senate will take up the legislation in a timely fashion.

(File photo by Travis Bell/STATEHOUSE CAROLINA/Specia to the SC Daily Gazette)Republicans appear to have narrowly held a state House seat representing Dorchester County in a special election a week ahead of the Legislature’s return.
Unofficial results show Republican Greg Ford just 21 votes ahead of Democrat Sonja Ogletree Satani.
With all 22 precincts reporting late Tuesday, Ford had 50.2% of the vote to Ogletree Satani’s 49.6%, sending the race to an automatic recount. In South Carolina, a recount is required if less than 1 percentage point separates the candidates.
The 3,442 ballots cast represented 14% of the district’s registered voters. Special elections are typically low-turnout races. But the results were surprisingly close for a seat that had long been considered safely Republican.
The special election was triggered by the departure of Rep. Chris Murphy. The former House Judiciary chairman submitted his resignation in August, but it didn’t take effect until Monday. The state law he cited in his “irrevocable resignation” allowed the special election timeline to proceed while he was still technically in office.
First elected in 2010, Murphy replaced GOP Rep. Annette Young, who didn’t seek re-election after 20 years in the House.
Both Ford and Ogletree Satani defeated two opponents in their primaries.
Once certified by the state Election Commission, the winner will face re-election in November for a full term.
Ogletree Satani previously ran against Murphy in 2024. That vote wasn’t nearly as close: Murphy won re-election by 14 percentage points.
Tuesday’s special election marked the fourth for a Statehouse seat since the 2025 legislative session ended.
Three elections were held Dec. 23, all in ruby red districts. In the only race that day with a Democrat on the ballot, Lexington County pastor John Lastinger won with 62% of the vote to replace ex-Rep. RJ May, who is set to be sentenced next week after pleading guilty to distributing videos of children being sexually abused.
In the Upstate, former Sen. Lee Bright returns to the seat he lost in 2016 representing parts of Spartanburg and Greenville counties; and Dianne Mitchell, a former teacher with the backing of the hardline Freedom Caucus, will represent a Greenville County seat in the House.
If the results in the Dorchester County race are finalized this week, the legislative session will start Tuesday with all 170 seats filled.

The shelter location will rotate between six churches over the next nine weeks. (Photo courtesy of Caroline Wilson) In Martinsburg, six churches are teaming up with a local nonprofit organization to shelter homeless people during the coldest weeks of the year. 
The Cold Weather Shelter officially opened Saturday at Christ Reformed United Church of Christ in Martinsburg, West Virginia. The location of the shelter will rotate each week to a different Martinsburg church over the next nine weeks. It will be open from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. 
“Right now we’ve got six churches covering the nine weeks,” said Caroline Wilson, a social worker for WVU Medicine and one of the shelter project’s organizers. “So everything gets in the back of the truck on Saturday and goes to the next place.”
Shelter coordinator Hannah Cooper said as of Monday, the shelter had housed eight people. Staff expect more people in the coming days as word about the shelter spreads. 
“We’ve had quite a few individuals come in, and we’ve been able to help them in numerous ways, not only just having them stay there overnight, but also connecting them with the appropriate referral services for some needs they have,” Cooper said. 
The shelter will be staffed and operated by the Martinsburg Initiative. It will house up to 20 people per night. While the Eastern Panhandle has homeless shelters, Wilson said this one will be different because it won’t require people to participate in any programs in order to use the shelter. It will be open to anyone age 18 and order.

Wilson said a warming center or winter shelter was identified as a community need three years ago, and the shelter finally came to fruition this year. 
“The fact is, even though we do have some housing resources, there are still people sleeping outside,” Wilson said. “So we identified that we needed something that was low-barrier that people could go to when it was cold. Because we’ve had deaths across the state over the past few years, not a lot, but some people have died out in the cold. And we would definitely not want to see that happen here.”
Wilson said the project gained momentum when she connected with the Martinsburg Initiative and Rev. Sherry Miller, pastor of St. John’s Lutheran Church in Martinsburg. 
“Basically about six months or so ago we were able to form the right team of one nonprofit executive director, which is Margaret from the Martinsburg initiative, one pastor who was really passionate about this project, which is Sherry Miller, and then me, a social worker who was really passionate about homelessness,” Wilson said. “And so we kind of started working on this and pulling in churches and working towards funding and all of that.”
Miller said she’s wanted to find a way for her church to house homeless people since a 17-degree day during her first winter with the congregation, three years ago. 
Miller pulled in support from the churches, and the Martinsburg Initiative took on the staffing, insurance and liability needed for the shelter. 
“It really has just been amazing how this team of three have been able to get this off and running,” Miller said. 
The WATTS shelter in Winchester, Virginia and one in Charles Town — both that rotate between churches — became the models for Martinsburg’s cold weather shelter project, she said. 
The project is funded by the city of Martinsburg and has received other grants. 
Miller said the key to getting churches on board was having the nonprofit organization running the shelter take on the associated liability. Many parishes have older buildings that people put lots of time and energy into to take care of them, she said.
“The first thing is that the nonprofit status is through the Martinsburg Initiative, so that once they come into a church, then the church has no liability, because the nonprofit takes over,” Miller said. “And so that is the first hurdle for churches. And I really try to make sure that they’re aware of that.”
Miller said she also encourages churches to participate in order to fulfill Jesus’ command to care for their neighbors. Homelessness has increased in West Virginia and in the United States in recent years. Miller said the number of homeless people is only going to increase as the cost of living and rent increases, she said.

“We need to love our neighbor and support those who are marginalized, and churches need to get back to the basics on that,” she said. 
Wilson said she hopes other communities can adopt the same rotating location model. 
Cooper said it may take several volunteers to change locations each week, but she’s prepared to have as many or few who show up. 
“It’s just, how easy is it going to make it for the people that are moving the shelter every week and how fatigued they may get from doing it,” she said. “So I really want to have that nice range of volunteers so nobody gets overly fatigued trying to work it all by themselves.”
The shelter is also looking for volunteer help with laundry each week, she said.

(Photo: Gabrielle Nelson/Buffalo’s Fire)Tennessee soybean farmers are still facing tough decisions ahead of the next growing season as they await aid from the federal government meant to offset substantial losses from 2025. 
Stefan Maupin, executive director of the Tennessee Soybean Promotion Council, described 2025 as a “trifecta” of inflation, extreme weather and unstable trade amid tariff negotiations. The University of Tennessee estimated in August that the state’s soybean farmers would see a combined $110 million in losses in 2025.
Disruption of trade with China, the number one purchaser of U.S.-grown soybeans in the world, ratcheted up pressure on soybean producers nationwide. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture is expected to start issuing one-time assistance payments at the end of February for commodity crop farmers who experienced trade market disruptions and increased production costs.
Eligible soybean farmers will receive $30.88 per acre, with a limit of $155,000 per producer. The USDA is also issuing payments for multiple other commodity crops based on acreage. The department released payment rates for each eligible crop on Dec. 31.
“Farmers are very appreciative of this, and we believe it’s a good first step, but overall, the payments will not make up for the losses,” Maupin said. “The inflation in the input products has still driven all of the cost to put in a crop to extremely high levels. The prices have improved on soybeans some, but certainly not to the levels they were before 2024.”
This means soybean farmers are, for now, still anticipating losing money on each acre they plant, he said.
Maupin has heard of some farmers who decided not to put in a crop this year, and many are still trying to make decisions for the upcoming season.
“The farmers, being the eternal optimists that they are, are hoping that they will have a good growing season and that the yields of their crops will be high and that they will help compensate for these high input costs and moderate prices,” Maupin said.
But another tough year may be too much to weather.
“There will be farmers that financially can try one more year, and they’ve indicated that they will, but that’s just not the case for everybody,” he said.
Farmer Bridge Assistance program
The USDA’s Farmer Bridge Assistance program will pay out up to $11 billion to producers of specific row crops at a per-acre rate:

Barley: $20.51
Canola: $23.57
Chickpeas (Large): $26.46
Chickpeas (Small): $33.36
Corn: $44.36
Cotton: $117.35

Safflower: $24.86
Sesame: $13.68
Sorghum: $48.11
Soybeans: $30.88
Sunflower: $17.32
Wheat: $39.35

The remaining $1 billion will be reserved for specialty crops, sugar and other commodities not covered in the Farmer Bridge Assistance program.
Payments are calculated using farmers’ 2025 planted acreage reports. To be eligible, producers must have an adjusted gross income less than $900,000. 
The USDA will begin issuing payments on Feb. 28.

(Photo: Brandon Bell/Getty Images)Tennessee’s infant mortality rate has dipped since 2019 but remains significantly and persistently higher than the national average, a new report published by the state’s health department found.
Black families in Tennessee continue to experience the heartbreak of losing a baby in the first year of life at twice the rate of white families, a stubborn disparity linked to maternal health, preterm births and access to prenatal care, among other factors. 
West Tennessee had some of the highest rates of infant mortality: 9.7 deaths per 1,000 live births. Knox County had the lowest at 3.4 deaths per 1,000 live births. 
Overall, Tennessee’s infant mortality rate of 6.5 deaths per 1,000 live births was 16% higher than the national average of 5.6 deaths per 1,000 live births. The report focuses on 2023 birth outcomes.
The 2023 infant deaths were largely a result of medical conditions, including preterm and low-birth-weight deliveries, and congenital disease. 
But unsafe sleeping practices, such as putting a baby to sleep on its belly, outside of a crib or bassinet or with blankets and stuffed animals that can potentially lead to suffocation, remained a significant factor in infant deaths. Sleep-related deaths claimed the lives of one in four babies between 2019 and 2023, the report found. Nearly four in five sleep-related deaths were deemed “preventable” by teams of experts who review child deaths.
The report makes a series of recommendations to combat Tennessee’s high rates of infant deaths. They include promoting safe sleep practices, smoking cessation programs and increasing awareness of prenatal services offered by public health departments.

(Photo by Angela Breck/Maryland Matters)It has been a difficult year for Maryland businesses. This is especially true for the many businesses that do business with the federal government. They have faced disruptions caused by federal reductions in force (RIFs) as well as sweeping changes in federal contracting and procurement policies. Companies have also been affected by an increase in tariff rates. And some state taxes have increased as well.
I and my colleagues have just completed a detailed survey to assess where Maryland businesses stand as we head toward the end of 2025. The survey asked respondents about this past year’s performance relative to 2024, their outlook over the next six months, the impact of federal policy changes, and their views of Maryland as a place to do business. Respondents also provided open-ended comments, and these attest to the very human costs behind the topline findings.
Overall, the survey paints a picture of a business community under pressure from rising costs and shifting federal and trade policies. Performance in 2025 was weaker than in 2024 for about half the firms in our sample of more than 90 companies. Still, many are cautiously optimistic about the next six months.
Rising costs remain a major challenge: roughly 80% of respondents reported higher costs, and most expect the trend to continue. These cost pressures have translated into higher prices. When asked to identify the most significant challenge of 2025, respondents highlighted rising costs, federal policy disruptions, and weak sales. As one put it, “The Maryland economy now faces unprecedented challenges and struggle, compounded by electricity price surges and costs.”

Views of writers are their own.




Federal policy changes have been especially disruptive. Many firms – particularly those heavily involved in federal contracting – reported negative impacts from RIFs and from changes in procurement and contracting policies. Staffing cuts have delayed payments and created administrative bottlenecks. One firm noted: “Contract officers are untrained, payments for services rendered are delayed, putting financial strain on small businesses.”
In some cases, contracts, grants and anticipated solicitations have been canceled altogether: “Federal contracting has almost completely dried up for us. Option years have been canceled or significantly de-scoped for most of our multi-year contracts.” However, a small number of respondents did report positive outcomes, most often in the aerospace and defense sector.
Other policy-related impacts also surfaced in the comments. The termination of programs supporting minority and economically disadvantaged businesses, as well as environmental initiatives, was noted repeatedly. One firm wrote: “We feel as if we are now working against our own federal government, which is trying to kill the solar industry.” Another pointed to the erosion of protections for socially/economically disadvantaged and minority-owned businesses. Respondents also highlighted a trend toward contract bundling – the practice of combining multiple contracts into fewer, larger awards – which tends to favor large firms over small.
Trade policy has introduced its own set of pressures for firms. Many companies reported that new tariffs have raised the cost of imported inputs and reduced supply chain reliability, although a few cited benefits from reduced foreign competition. Firms reported shifting sourcing countries, moving from international to domestic suppliers, and stockpiling critical inputs to manage disruptions.
Finally, we asked about Maryland’s business environment. Many firms view it unfavorably, and some reported having considered relocating to another state. High taxes, high operating costs, and housing affordability were top concerns. One respondent captured the sentiment bluntly: “Maryland is not a business-friendly state. We are at the point we can no longer afford the taxes that continue to go up and up.”
The recent increase in the sales and use tax on data and IT services was cited by several firms: “The 3% Technology Tax makes it difficult to compete with firms in VA, DE, and PA that do not have such a burden.” If there is a silver lining, it is that minority-owned businesses were somewhat less likely to view Maryland as unhospitable.
The survey does not suggest a uniformly dire situation, and many firms remain optimistic about the months ahead. Maryland’s talent base and proximity to federal agencies continue to be viewed as advantages. However, it is hard to escape the conclusion that the state has pressing structural issues that require urgent attention. Maryland businesses also need to adapt to a new reality of changed federal policies and priorities. Our finding that policy disruptions are hitting some firms much harder than others points to how support can be appropriately targeted while firms adjust to the new reality.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/open-1.jpg,,,2026-01-07 09:13:08.480832

(Getty Images)The board that regulates optometrists in Kentucky has filed emergency regulations to address exemptions from licensure requirements it improperly granted some optometry graduates in recent years.
But the Dec. 31 regulations, which took effect immediately, are drawing fire from critics who say they do nothing to explain the past actions of the Kentucky Board of Optometric Examiners or address whether optometrists who were exempted from mandatory exams are qualified to continue providing eye care to patients.
“Our focus has always been on patient safety,” Dr. Jill Bryant, executive director of the National Board of Examiners in Optometry, or NBEO, said in an email. “We are deeply concerned that the people of Kentucky are still receiving treatment from improperly licensed optometrists who have never demonstrated that they can successfully pass national competency assessments — and, in some instances, have repeatedly failed those assessments.”
The regulation allows any optometry graduate from 2020-2023 who has not passed all required licensure exams to do so by 2027. 
The board began granting waivers to testing requirements during the COVID-19 pandemic, citing travel and other restrictions. It continued to approve exemptions after the COVID emergency had ended, including in December 2023.
The NBEO administers licensure exams for optometry graduates in all 50 states. The Kentucky Lantern reported in December that the national board had identified 21 optometrists in Kentucky who had gained licenses from 2020 through 2023 without passing “one or more” parts of the three-part national exam then required by state law.
Among them was Dr. Hannah Ellis, the daughter of former board president Dr. Joe Ellis, a prominent Kentucky optometrist active in state and national optometry circles. He abruptly resigned from the board last month and has not responded to requests for comment.
Several of the optometrists who had not met all requirements, including Hannah Ellis, were graduates of the University of Pikeville College of Optometry, which opened in 2016 as Kentucky’s only optometry school.
Patient safety ‘forgotten?’
The state board has not responded to multiple requests for comment from the Lantern and has made little public comment apart from two brief statements on its website, the most recent  announcing the emergency regulations.
The board “feels strongly that all licensees should possess the skills and knowledge to be granted a license,” the Dec. 31 statement said in part.
Questionable testing waivers put KY’s licensing of optometrists under scrutiny

But the emergency regulations fall short of that goal, according to the Kentucky Academy of Eye Physicians and Surgeons, which represents medical doctors who specialize in eye care. In a statement, it called for “full transparency” from the state board in addressing the matter.
“We are concerned that they do not have a plan to address the educational shortfalls of those optometrists who could not pass the nationally standardized licensure tests — at least some of whom are performing surgical procedures on Kentucky patients,” the academy said in a statement.
Optometrists hold a four-year doctorate of optometry degree and following a 2011 lobbying blitz at the Kentucky General Assembly, won a broad expansion of their scope of practice including the right to perform some eye surgeries. The NBEO has described it as “one of the broadest scopes of practice in the United States.”
Dr. William “Chip” Richardson, a Georgetown ophthalmologist and former president of the academy, said he is “frankly disheartened” by the board’s proposed solution that appears to allow optometrists who have not met professional standards to continue treating patients. He also believes the new regulations water down requirements.
“What’s sadly forgotten here is patient safety,” he said in an email.
‘Kind of puzzled’
A key legislator also wants further information from the state board, including why it granted exemptions for some candidates and whether they hold a valid license to treat patients.
Sen. Stephen Meredith, R-Leitchfield, (LRC Public Information)
Sen. Stephen Meredith, R-Leitchfield and chair of the Senate Health Services Committee, said he expects to seek answers from the board through his committee during the legislative session that convened Tuesday.
“I’m still kind of puzzled by it all,” Meredith said. “We need to know what’s going on.”
Meredith sought the Oct. 1 Kentucky attorney general’s opinion that found the state board circumvented state law by authorizing exemptions for licensure through board actions rather than through enacting new regulations.
It directed the board to review the licensure of all optometrists granted licenses with such exemptions.
Meredith said he’s also concerned that the former board president’s daughter was among those granted exemptions and plans to inquire about that.
“That’s obviously a conflict of interest,” he said.
The emergency regulations state they are in response to the attorney general’s opinion. 
It found that the board “acted beyond its authority” in waiving some requirements for licensure, instead allowing “alternative testing” it did not detail. The opinion added that “any person who applied for a license to practice optometry using the waiver and alternative testing did not comply with the relevant regulations.”
While the board has acknowledged waiving Part 3 of the exam, an in-person testing of clinical skills with patients — citing restrictions of the pandemic — it has remained silent about any other exemptions.
The Lantern identified at least six instances when the board acted on exemptions to testing — including an apparent decision in December 2023, after the COVID emergency had ended — to waive Part 1 of the exam.
Board minutes state without elaboration that some optometry school graduates unable to pass Part 1 “will be allowed licensure with additional educational requirements.” Part 1, which focuses on science and medical knowledge, is considered the hardest of the exam’s three parts.
Last year, the state board enacted a regulation allowing Kentucky licensure candidates to substitute the Canadian exam, considered easier to pass, saying in written comments that some optometry graduates were unable to pass Part 1 of the national exam.
 Duty to ‘protect the public’

The new regulations state that optometry graduates from 2020 through 2023 must show that they have passed either Part 1 of the national exam or the Canadian exam before they renew their licenses in 2027.

Also, they must pass Part 2 of the national exam, which tests a candidate’s skills at diagnosis and treatment.
And they must pass either Part 3 of the national exam, which tests how well a candidate performs in treating people posing as patients — or it allows for candidates to pass a new, Kentucky version of the test to be developed specifically for those candidates previously exempted.
 The emergency regulations say that all affected licensees will be notified by Jan. 15 of the requirements.
The Kentucky Optometric Association released a statement in support of the new regulation but called for the changes to be implemented “in a transparent manner to ensure that public safety and licensee qualifications are never called into question.”
The board’s Dec. 31 statement provides no details of how the board reached a decision, developed the emergency regulations or whether it took a vote on them.
The board met in December but made no public comment or what members discussed in a closed session. 
It has never responded to the NBEO which in a May 23, 2025 letter said that it had identified 21 optometrists in Kentucky who appear to have been granted a license without having passed “one or more” parts of the three-part national exam.
The Dec. 31 statement on the Kentucky board’s website said the board acknowledged it did not use the “correct regulatory process” during the COVID-19 emergency when it temporarily waived the requirement that candidates pass Part 3 of the national exam. It makes no mention of waiving Part 1.
However, all candidates seeking to renew licenses must show by 2027 that they have met all requirements, it said, stating:
“The duty of the Kentucky Board of Optometric Examiners is to license qualified optometrists as well as protect the public, and the current board members are committed to executing this responsibility.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2210182104-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-07 05:56:55.245249

(Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources)A Wisconsin Assembly committee held a public hearing Tuesday on a bill that would require the state to hold an annual hunt of sandhill cranes. 
The sandhill crane was once nearly extinct and its recovery is seen as a conservation success story. Similar to the return of the wolf, the growth of the sandhill crane population has caused a long running political debate in Wisconsin. For years, Republicans in the Legislature have been pushing for a sandhill crane hunt — arguing the opening of recreational opportunities would benefit the state’s hunting industry and advocating for eating the birds’ meat. 
The proposal this session stems from a legislative study committee commissioned last summer which examined how to mitigate damage caused by the birds to the state’s farm fields and the possibility of holding a hunt. Estimates say that each year the birds cause almost $2 million in crop damage, mostly to corn seeds that are eaten before they can sprout. 
In the initial version of the bill proposed by the study committee, a number of provisions were included that would have directly addressed the crop damage. If a sandhill crane hunt is authorized, that would allow farmers to access money through an existing Department of Natural Resources damage abatement program, but otherwise all the farm-specific provisions have been removed from the version of the bill now being considered by the Assembly. 
If a bird is frequently damaging a farmer’s crops, a depredation permit is obtainable from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, however federal law requires that the bird’s carcass not be consumed. 
Rep. Paul Tittl (R-Manitowoc), the bill’s author, said the bill is a “well thought out proposal to relieve farmers and promote new opportunities for hunters.” 
But Democrats on the committee and critics of the bill questioned why the specific farmer assistance programs were cut out, how a hunt would affect the crane population and how much establishing a hunt would cost the DNR. 
Rep. Vincent Miresse (D-Stevens Point) noted that the Republicans were simultaneously arguing that holding a hunt wouldn’t significantly impact the state’s crane population and that holding a hunt would help mitigate the crop damage caused by the birds. 
“If it’s not going to impact the population very much, then how do we protect farmers’ investment in seed and corn sprouts and potatoes and cranberries, if we’re not going to actually impact the population to the benefit of the farmer,” Miresse said. 
Taylor Finger, the DNR’s game bird specialist, said in his testimony that opening the existing crop damage abatement program up to sandhill crane damage without adding additional funds to the program would result in “worse outcomes for farmers seeking assistance.” 
Republicans on the committee largely questioned the testimony of sandhill crane researchers. Anne Lacy, director of eastern flyway programs at the Baraboo-based International Crane Foundation, said she is concerned about holding a hunt in Wisconsin because it is one of the few places on the continent where sandhill cranes breed. 
“I don’t think there is a [population] number that justifies a hunt,” Lacy said. “There are many states that hunt sandhill cranes, and they do it successfully. They’ve been managed for years, including this population. But Wisconsin is a breeding state, so that puts a different spin on a hunting season … So it’s not so much a number. It is how a hunt affects this bird because of its ecology.”
In an extended back and forth in which he raised his voice, Rep. Shae Sortwell (R-Two Rivers) pushed Lacy to say she is supportive of sandhill crane hunts elsewhere. 
“All right, so I catch you dodging me, so therefore you do not personally support a hunt in any other state,” Sortwell said.

(Photo by Jesus Vargas/Getty Images)As Virginia lawmakers prepare to return to Richmond next week for the start of the 2026 General Assembly, Democratic officials across the state and congressional delegation are mounting a unified pushback against the U.S. military strike on Venezuela and the arrest of President Nicolás Maduro, while Republicans have largely praised the operation as a long-overdue show of force.
Del. Dan Helmer, D-Fairfax, plans to file legislation ahead of the session that would restrict the federal government from deploying the Virginia National Guard to overseas conflicts like Venezuela — or using Guard troops in American cities — without clear legal authorization. 
“I’m a big believer that the Virginia National Guard should be used to support U.S. national security, but not to suppress the will of Americans or to support reckless adventurers overseas,” Helmer told The Mercury Tuesday. 
Helmer’s proposal comes as Democrats argue the strike represents an unconstitutional expansion of presidential war powers, even as Republicans contend it removed a dangerous authoritarian leader and strengthened U.S. security.
President Donald Trump announced over the weekend that U.S. forces had captured Maduro during a military operation inside Venezuela and that the United States would oversee a transition period in the country. 
Trump said the U.S. would “run the country” during the transition, remarks that drew immediate scrutiny from lawmakers concerned about executive overreach.
The operation involved U.S. military strikes and a special forces mission to detain Maduro, who has long been indicted in the United States on drug trafficking and narco-terrorism charges.  
Administration officials defended the action as necessary to disrupt drug networks and hold Maduro accountable after years of authoritarian rule.
 Helmer cites Guard authority, Venezuelan community as concerns mount

Trump’s announcement sent shockwaves through Washington and state capitals alike, including in Virginia, which is home to more than 9,000 Venezuelans, according to the most recent U.S. Census Bureau estimates. 
Many in that community fled political repression, economic collapse and violence under Maduro’s government, and have been closely following developments in their home country. Over 7.9 million Venezuelan refugees and migrants have left the country “in search of protection and a better life,” according to UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency.
Helmer, a former Army officer who served multiple tours in Iraq, said the strike underscores the need for states to assert their own authority when federal officials bypass Congress and governors in deploying National Guard troops.

His legislation, he said, is rooted in personal experience and concern about unchecked military deployments. 
“I lost friends in a war twice in Iraq because politicians lack the courage to stand up and stop a war of choice,” Helmer said, adding that Congress has too often failed to assert its authority before service members are put in harm’s way.
Helmer emphasized that his proposal would require a legal review of certain National Guard deployments, demand disclosure of their scope and justification, and allow the Virginia attorney general to intervene if a deployment is deemed unlawful. 
The bill would also prohibit the use of state resources to mobilize the Virginia National Guard against Virginians, against other states, or to influence elections, while stopping short of blocking Guard missions that clearly serve U.S. national security interests.
He said the measure is designed to place guardrails within existing federal law and Supreme Court precedent, giving states greater leverage to challenge what he called reckless or politically motivated uses of military force.
 Democrats cite constitutional limits, warn of escalation

Virginia’s congressional Democrats echoed Helmer’s concerns, framing the Venezuela strike as part of a broader pattern of unilateral military action.
U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, who has spent years pressing Congress to reclaim its constitutional role in authorizing war, condemned the strike as a return to failed interventionist policies.
“President Trump’s unauthorized military attack on Venezuela to arrest Maduro — however terrible he is — is a sickening return to a day when the United States asserted the right to dominate the internal political affairs of all nations in the Western Hemisphere,” Kaine said in a statement.
Kaine warned that bypassing Congress makes it harder for the United States to demand respect for its own sovereignty and questioned where such actions could lead. He said it was “long past time” for Congress to reassert its authority over matters of war and peace.
Alongside Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Ca., Kaine filed a War Powers Resolution last month, seeking to block U.S. military hostilities against Venezuela without congressional authorization. That resolution is expected to come up for a vote next week.
U.S. Sen. Mark R. Warner, vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said the decision to use military force for regime change demands “the closest scrutiny,” particularly given the global implications.
Warner said that while Maduro is a corrupt authoritarian who has repressed his people and overseen stolen elections and mass displacement, those facts do not grant the president authority to ignore constitutional limits.
“If the United States asserts the right to use military force to invade and capture foreign leaders it accuses of criminal conduct, what prevents China from claiming the same authority over Taiwan’s leadership?” Warner said, warning that such precedents invite instability and abuse by authoritarian regimes.

Warner also criticized what he called hypocrisy in the administration’s approach, noting that Trump recently pardoned former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández, who was convicted in a U.S. court on serious drug trafficking charges, while claiming similar allegations justified military force in Venezuela.
In the House, U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Newport News, said he was “deeply concerned” by reports of U.S. military strikes and the capture of a foreign head of state.
Scott said the administration has yet to identify a clear legal basis for its actions in Venezuela or explain how long U.S. involvement could last.
“Escalating military action inside a sovereign country without congressional authorization raises serious questions under both U.S. and international law,” Scott said, adding that military force is among the least effective ways to address drug trafficking compared with education, prevention and addiction treatment.
U.S. Rep. Suhas Subramanyam, D-Loudoun, a ranking member of the Military and Foreign Affairs Oversight Subcommittee, said the administration’s actions amounted to illegal regime change rather than a legitimate counter-drug effort.
“President Trump said he’d be the ‘Peace President’ and wouldn’t start any new wars, and yet here he is illegally invading another country and kidnapping its President,” Subramanyam said, warning the move could lead to prolonged instability and another “forever war.”
 Republicans praise strike, with some urging caution

Republicans in Virginia largely offered a sharply different assessment, praising the operation as decisive and long overdue.
U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Virginia Beach, whose district includes a large military population, said the operation demonstrated American resolve.
“The strength of the United States is rooted in the courage and dedication of the men and women who serve in our Armed Forces. That strength was on full display,” Kiggans said, thanking U.S. service members for carrying out what she described as a precise and successful mission to apprehend Maduro and disrupt narcotics trafficking.
U.S. Rep. John McGuire, R-Goochland, a former Navy SEAL, also celebrated the strike, linking it to domestic concerns about drug overdoses and border security. He said Venezuela had become a proxy for U.S. adversaries and a source of instability that harmed American communities.

Outgoing Gov. Glenn Youngkin praised Trump’s leadership in a post on X, formerly Twitter, saying accountability for Maduro’s abuses “protects Americans first and foremost” and strengthens democracy and security across the Western Hemisphere.
Attorney General Jason Miyares, who is also set to leave office next week, welcomed Maduro’s arrest, writing that it was “wonderful for the Venezuelan people” to see their leader detained after years of economic collapse under socialist rule.
But not all Republicans were unequivocal in their support. 
U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Salem, compared the situation to the 1990 U.S. capture of Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega but cautioned against open-ended military engagement.
“I am concerned about U.S. military intervention in foreign countries because of its potential to lead to protracted U.S. engagement,” Griffith said, adding that he would seek more information about future U.S. involvement and insist on congressional oversight.
With the General Assembly set to convene and Congress preparing to vote on war powers, Helmer’s legislation and Kaine’s resolution are set to test how much appetite there is to rein in presidential authority, amid Republican praise for what they describe as a decisive show of American strength.

(Photo by Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)As state lawmakers prepare to reconvene in Richmond for the 2026 legislative session next week, Virginia is also working to reduce its Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) error rate or risk losing its federal funding, while also now verifying recipients’ eligibility — which levies more work onto already-strained health and social service systems. They also must contend with forthcoming changes to Medicaid eligibility. 
Social services staffers around Virginia have for years grappled with outdated technology and are now preparing for extra workloads; a new bill could spur upgrades that might help.
Here’s what Virginia is doing so far to reduce its SNAP error rate

House Bill 66 by Del. Michael Feggans, D-Virginia Beach, would direct the Department of Medical Assistance Services and the Department of Social Services to modernize the information technology they use to provide social and medical programs to Virginians. 
While the federal shifts make it timely, the departments’ old tech isn’t a new issue. The Virginia Case Management System (VaCMS) — first built in the 1990s — is outdated, a 2024 state-commissioned study revealed.
It’s also a concern Feggans heard last year from constituents as he served on a bipartisan committee to assess how the state could respond to federal cuts. 
The 2024 study noted delays or timeouts if more than a few hundred social services workers were processing cases simultaneously on VaCMS — a common occurrence, considering eligibility determination work is handled by hundreds of local social services workers around Virginia. 
“Poor user experience with VaCMS leads to the use of workarounds, further increasing variability in the process,” the report stated. 
The note of constraints with VaCMS was among “strong concerns” relayed by the Virginia League of Social Services Executives in feedback last summer to the state government, records obtained by The Mercury show. 
Smaller staff at local offices have also expressed worry about the extra work outlined in the reconciliation bill Congress passed last summer. The federal legislation spurs states to reduce their error rates for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits along with eligibility determination changes for both SNAP and Medicaid. 
While SNAP helps low-income people afford groceries, states that fail to reduce their error rates could be on the hook for millions that the federal government typically provides. Error rates — an overpayment or underpayment to beneficiaries — can stem from paperwork mistakes by social service workers or outdated information from recipients. About 850,000 Virginians rely on the program to feed their families. 
Medicaid is a joint state and federal program that provides health insurance coverage to about 1.9 million Virginians who live with disabilities, are pregnant or low-income earners without employer-provided coverage. Changes to Medicaid eligibility could likely affect about 630,000 of Virginians at risk of losing it and the expanded work load for social services workers, which Virginia’s Medicaid director told state lawmakers last summer will “be hard on them.” 
Slower and outdated technology can  increase margins for human error and make it harder for Virginia to meet the federal mandates. 
Feggans said it’s important for state lawmakers to “make sure that we can take care of as many people as we can in the state with so many cuts coming from the federal government.”
The state government should invest in a new IT system to counteract these challenges, Feggans added. Prior to his service in the legislature, Feggans worked in health care technology for the U.S. Air Force. He “knows what it means” to have systems that are efficient. 
As the bill must advance through the legislature in order to end up on Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger’s desk, Feggans said he plans to work with his fellow lawmakers to sort out how feasible the upgrades may be and at what cost. Amid continued federal funding and service cuts, Feggans emphasized how careful Virginia must be with its resources while still being able to “take care” of constituents.
“The next few years are going to be about austerity,” he said.

Mike DeWine and the head of the state’s Department of Children and Youth say they’ve engaged with the Trump administration to prove Ohio’s child care system is heavily safeguarded and worthy of federal funding.
DeWine and department Director Kara Wente said they haven’t received final word that they will continue receiving federal funding for the Publicly Funded Child Care program, but the state has eight to 10 weeks before “that would be problematic for the program we have now,” according to Wente.
“Certainly we know that we need the federal funds to maintain our program as is,” Wente said in a Monday news conference with DeWine.
“We know that we are moving on every measure that (the Trump administration) has outlined.”
The state leaders spoke to the media after allegations of child care fraud in Minnesota resulted in federal funding freezes for the state, ordered by Trump administration officials.
The allegations came from a right-wing social media influencer and focused on facilities run by Somali immigrants in the state. While the issue was covered extensively in 2022, the social media influencer’s latest allegations have brought it back to the forefront.
Minnesota child care providers say Trump’s funding freeze will shut down their businesses

Ohio, like Minnesota, has one of the largest Somali populations in the country, but DeWine said the conversation should be steered away from the type of citizens running the centers, and toward protecting the public from fraud.
“We need to look at this as not a Somali problem, we need to look at this as a fraud problem,” DeWine said.
The governor said the “vast majority” of the Somali population in Ohio “have been here for a long time.”
He wouldn’t speculate on whether race or ethnicity was playing into the accusations of fraud at child care facilities.
“Many of them are citizens, many of them run businesses,” DeWine said. “So we need to not fixate on any one population, we need to fixate on the problem.”

The state leaders responded to calls from Republican state Rep. Josh Williams, who took to social media to demand that the Ohio Department of Children and Youth “investigate all Columbus-area daycares suspected of potential fraud.”
“We need round-the-clock, unannounced inspections of all child care facilities receiving public dollars to make sure not a single Ohioan’s tax dollars are being stolen,” Williams wrote in a post on X.
Wente said on Monday that her office has been in contact with Williams, telling him the measures he asked for are already methods the department uses to oversee child care centers.
DeWine also decried efforts by public citizens to enter child care facilities, saying the safeguards that are in place at facilities include keeping those who don’t work there or have children in the care of the facility from coming in.
“The facts are there’s a reason that citizens who are going up to video something and trying to see what’s going on inside the doors aren’t being allowed in,” DeWine said, adding that it shouldn’t be a shock that those people are barred from entry.
“Well hell no, no one should let them in,” he said.
At Monday’s press conference, DeWine and Wente provided a lot of the information provided by the governor’s office last week in a press release responding to the Minnesota headlines, including specific measures the state takes to try to prevent and identify fraud in child care centers.
That includes attendance-based funding, identity verification at individual facilities via PINs and QR codes, and regular inspections.
Child care advocates also defended the state’s child care sector last week, and affirmed the governor’s defense that facilities undergo strict scrutiny.
Wente also provided data on 61 child care facilities who were ordered by the department to return overpayments.
In total, the overpayments amounted to “just over $2 million,” the director told reporters.
In 2025, the department received 124 reports from citizens alleging child care fraud.
DeWine remains confident that the Trump administration will review Ohio’s child care program and continue sending federal funding to the state.
“We have about eight weeks and we have every confidence this will get resolved, and the federal government will be satisfied with what we’re doing,” DeWine said.

There’s more to come in 2026. The lawsuits are part of a coordinated legal strategy by Democratic AGs in 22 states and the District of Columbia to resist the ever-widening power of the executive branch.
It’s not unusual for states to sue an administration; the party not in the White House has often turned to the courts. But it’s one of the few pathways for Democrats now, since Republicans hold the presidency, both chambers of Congress and have appointed a majority of the U.S. Supreme Court. And Trump in his second term has taken a much broader view of presidential power than previous administrations, asserting far more authority than his predecessors.
Democrats hope to retake at least one chamber of Congress in November’s midterm elections. But for most of the coming year, the party will be relying on AG court challenges as their main venue to take on Trump.
‘A boundless power’: Democratic states ask Supreme Court to halt Trump troop deployment to Chicago

One of the most prolific AGs is Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield, who has led or joined 52 lawsuits against this Trump administration.
“It’s not a slogan or a political brand,” Rayfield said of the coalition in an email interview with Stateline. “It’s a working partnership. When we coordinate, we’re able to defend the constitutional balance, push back when a president overreaches, and make sure our residents aren’t left paying the price for unlawful decisions coming out of Washington.”
The state AGs have brought cases over Trump’s tariffs and National Guard deployments. They’ve also fought cuts to federal research, education programs, food assistance, disaster recovery, health care and housing. And they say it’s their job to maintain core civil rights protections as well as stick up for the people in their state who, they argue, are harmed by the whims of the president’s executive orders.
“None of the institutions in our government have been built to respond and react to the scale and speed of the destruction that’s being wrought by the Trump administration,” New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez told Source New Mexico.
Since the beginning of 2025, the attorneys general have toured the country on multistate listening tours and have touted their accomplishments on progressive legal podcasts. They’ve won 40 of the 51 resolved cases, according to a tracker from the Progressive State Leaders Committee.
The AGs are not alone in taking legal action. Individuals, businesses, labor unions, associations, universities, local governments and other entities have filed 554 cases against the president’s expansion of executive branch powers, according to Just Security, a daily digital law policy journal with a litigation tracker that monitors challenges to Trump administration executive actions.
But the attorney general coalition serves as “a coordinated, quick-moving and high-capacity force protecting the rule of law, federal funding streams, and people’s rights,” said Jonathan Miller, chief program officer of the Public Rights Project, which helps state and local governments partner on litigation that protects and advances civil rights.










That’s the foundation for restoring faith in democratic institutions: making the legal system work the way it’s supposed to for the people it’s supposed to serve.


– Jonathan Miller, chief program officer of the Public Rights Project


The attorneys general have proven such a successful coalition that the Public Rights Project is adopting a similar approach that makes it easier for cities and counties to pool expertise, coordinate legal theories and act collectively, Miller said.
“The rule of law is ultimately about people,” Miller said. “When courts enforce the law, families stay housed, public health and emergency services stay open, and local leaders can govern without political coercion. That’s the foundation for restoring faith in democratic institutions: making the legal system work the way it’s supposed to for the people it’s supposed to serve.”
Immediate action
Democratic AGs began filing their multistate lawsuits the day after Trump took office, challenging the president’s executive order ending birthright citizenship. The immediate legal action was intended to send a clear message to the Trump administration that state attorneys general will “stand up for our residents and their basic constitutional rights,” New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin said in a statement at the time. The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to hear arguments in the case this spring.
Rayfield said some days their work aims to build an emergency firewall to halt unlawful presidential actions — such as deploying the National Guard. Other days, it’s more targeted, fact-driven litigation designed to keep money, benefits and services flowing to states.
In December, Rayfield, New York Attorney General Letitia James and Washington Attorney General Nick Brown led a coalition of 19 attorneys general and the governor of Pennsylvania in challenging the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for threatening to punish doctors, hospitals and clinics that provide gender-affirming care.
Democratic AGs sue DOJ to receive federal funding for victims of violent crimes

In early November, the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments from Oregon’s then-solicitor general, Benjamin Gutman, who argued on behalf of a coalition of a dozen states that sued over Trump’s sweeping tariff policy on most goods entering the United States. Rayfield and Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes began discussing a tariff lawsuit in April, before a joint appearance at a town hall in Oregon. Both had been considering it, but it was their in-person discussion that led to the collaboration, Mayes said during a panel discussion hosted by the “Legal AF” podcast on the MeidasTouch Network.
“This is not what I get up every day wanting to do,” Mayes told Cronkite News outside the Supreme Court, after Gutman argued the tariff case. “But if Donald Trump decides to violate the Constitution, violate statute, or harm the people of Arizona, I’m going to file that lawsuit.”
After Trump’s 2024 election, Democratic attorneys general began meeting almost daily over Zoom to prepare their legal approach for a second term. This time around, they had a better sense for what was coming because it was outlined in Project 2025, the conservative blueprint that has shaped much of the Trump administration’s agenda so far.
As they enter their second year of legal collaboration, the AGs continue to meet regularly, but because they’ve developed close working relationships, it’s at a “more sustainable cadence,” Rayfield said.
Republicans sue, too
Republican attorneys general say they, too, are taking action to protect state sovereignty. Alaska Attorney General Stephen Cox wrote in an op-ed in The Washington Post in November that lawsuits emerging from progressive states, particularly state- and municipal-driven cases in state courts over climate change, are “as much of a threat to state sovereignty as the federal government” as well as an attempt to “remake the nation in the image of progressive enclaves such as San Francisco and Portland, Oregon.”
“They reach into states like Alaska with their rules and regulations,” Cox wrote. “They push misguided legal theories targeting ordinary Americans. And they file lawsuits that would give state courts in ideologically aligned jurisdictions the chance to control the economies of states like mine.”
Republican attorneys general have been largely supportive of the president’s second-term agenda, including supporting the deployment of out-of-state National Guard troops to protect federal facilities. Led by Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr, Republican attorneys general in 26 states sent a letter in support of such a mobilization in June in Los Angeles, describing it as “the right response — and one we fully support.” And as recently as October, Republican attorneys general in 16 states wrote a letter supporting the Trump administration’s attacks on boats it says are smuggling drugs in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean.
State attorneys general have long taken on the executive branch, no matter who was in power.
Democratic attorneys general filed 138 multistate lawsuits against federal agencies during Trump’s first administration, according to a 2020 assessment by Paul Nolette, a political scientist at Marquette University in Milwaukee.
And some Republican attorneys general were especially litigious during the Biden administration. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton famously sued the Biden administration 106 times, including a suit challenging the administration’s offshore drilling policy in the final days of the presidency. Paxton followed in the footsteps of his Republican predecessor, now-Gov. Greg Abbott, who sued the Obama administration 31 times as a Republican attorney general: “I go to the office. I sue the federal government. Then I go home,” he told The Dallas Morning News in 2012.
20 state AGs sue feds for tying transportation and disaster funding to immigration enforcement

Attorneys general in more progressive states say their actions during the current administration have kept their states from losing billions of dollars in federal funds that would have otherwise been blocked for schools, public health, domestic violence prevention and other services. In Oregon, it’s an estimated $4.5 billion, Rayfield said. Arizona estimates it has held on to $1.5 billion. In California, it’s $168 billion.
In Oregon, one of the lawsuit hearings this fall drew an audience so large that an overflow courtroom adjacent to a packed main federal courtroom was needed. A crowd quietly watched arguments on a video display as lawyers for the state of Oregon and the city of Portland argued that the Trump administration’s deployment of National Guard troops was not only a vast federal overreach, but also a threat to state sovereignty and public safety.
The administration said it deployed the Guard to protect federal agents, including those from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. But when an attorney for the U.S. Justice Department described protesters as “vicious and cruel radicals” for their demonstrations outside of an ICE facility in Portland, the phrase elicited muffled snickers from the otherwise decorous courtroom observers.
Among the protesters dominating news reports and social media feeds was a 20-something in a chicken costume. Other peaceful protesters spawned a new symbol of resistance: inflatable frog costumes. And naked bike riders rolled up en masse to the ICE facility, too, braving a cold, wet day and exposure on Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show.”
But the issue in front of U.S. District Judge Karin J. Immergut was no laughing matter.
Oregon’s lawsuit challenging Trump’s National Guard deployment was a critical public safety outcome for the state, Rayfield said. It prevented troops from mobilizing in Portland, forestalling what he described as “the kind of escalation that could have caused real harm.”
Attorneys general are prepared in 2026 to monitor and enforce their courtroom victories, Rayfield said. He and other state officials and local prosecutors have warned U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi that excessive force by DHS officers won’t be tolerated during immigration enforcement activities. If warranted, they’ll refer them for prosecution, he said.
“That isn’t just a legal win — it’s a safety win,” Rayfield said. “The president cannot use federalization as a shortcut to move troops into American cities without lawful cause. That matters for Portland, and it matters for every state watching what happened here.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-07 10:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"Flu cases, hospitalizations are rising sharply in CT",Jenna Carlesso and Angela Eichhorst,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/07/ct-flu-cases-hospitalizations-rising/,"Flu cases in CT have increased dramatically over the last month, and officials say the surge in illnesses is happening earlier this year.","Flu cases in Connecticut have increased dramatically over the last month, and health officials say the surge in illnesses is happening earlier this season.
For the week ending Nov. 29, 831 cases were reported. A month later, during the week ending Dec. 27, the state recorded 4,755 cases.
The numbers are far higher than what was reported in December of last year. During the final week of 2024, the state logged 611 flu cases.
Hospitalizations are also on the rise. Seventy-three were reported during the week that ended on Nov. 29; a month later, the state reported 432 hospitalizations.
“Looking at the trajectory of our curve for the flu right now, it’s up,” Dr. Manisha Juthani, the state’s public health commissioner. “Unfortunately, I predict it’s going to be a tough winter. I don’t know where we’ll top out.”
“It’s definitely far earlier than last year,” she said of the surge in cases. “And would I say it’s maybe a little bit earlier than a typical flu season.”
The increase is not unique to Connecticut. Several other states have seen big jumps in cases this month. New York’s health department said the week ending Dec. 20 marked the most flu cases the state had recorded in a single week since 2004: 71,000.
“What everybody’s alarmed about right now is the rapid rise,” said Dr. Ulysses Wu, chief epidemiologist and system director for infectious diseases at Hartford HealthCare. “The mountain was much steeper in the sense that we went from basically zero to 60 in a matter of weeks.”
Why are cases and hospitalizations up?
Health officials say the rise in cases and hospitalizations is being driven by a new flu variant known as subclade K.
There are two subtypes of Type A flu, and subclade K is a mutated version of one of them, called H3N2. The H3N2 strain is harsh, especially for older adults.
“Any year where H3N2 predominates tends to be a worse year,” Juthani said.
Subclade K’s mutations aren’t enough of a change to be considered an entirely new kind of flu. But they’re different enough to evade some of the protection from this year’s vaccine, medical providers said.
“The mutations have made it more communicable. It’s basically new to our immune system, so that’s why it’s evading our immune system,” Wu said.
While the new variant appears to spread more quickly, it’s not yet known if it is more severe than others.
“It’s definitely more transmissible,” said Dr. Karl Hellstrand, chair of the emergency department at Saint Mary’s Hospital in Waterbury. “The strain is new, so people don’t really have any kind of protection from seeing it in the past.”
The symptoms of subclade K are similar to other variants, he said. They include fever, body aches, sore throat, lethargy and sometimes vomiting and abdominal pain.
Still, Juthani said, the flu vaccine is effective against hospitalization and death. 
“In data that we’re seeing published around the world, the flu shot is 70% protective for hospitalization and death in adults,” she said.
What concerns do health officials have?
Health officials said they worry about increasing vaccine hesitancy and capacity at hospitals this flu season.
“My biggest concern is capacity at the hospitals,” Juthani said. “I worry about hospital capacity, [intensive care unit] capacity, and the overall strain on the health care system.
“Whenever there is less confidence in prevention efforts and less uptake of prevention efforts, health care will see the consequences down the road. That’s what I’m bracing for — what we’re going to continue to see as the weeks unfold.”
With the flu surge arriving earlier this season, physicians said they are concerned that not enough people have been vaccinated.
“It kind of snuck up on us. And there is a significant percentage of people who have not gotten vaccinated,” said Dr. Christopher Davison, chair of emergency medicine at Greenwich Hospital. “If you have not gotten vaccinated, now is the time to do that.”
“The annual, seasonal concern we deal with, almost like clockwork, is busy emergency rooms in combination with hospitals at capacity,” he added. “It’s a challenging combination, but we work through it.”

What can people do to protect themselves?
Getting a flu shot, practicing good hygiene — frequently washing hands and covering coughs and sneezes — and masking in crowded spaces can help prevent illness, health officials said.
“The influenza vaccine, it may not be perfect, but it will help you,” Wu said. “We measure vaccine effectiveness for some of these diseases by keeping people out of the hospital. So, its job is to keep people out of the hospital. Even though people may think there’s a bit of a flu mismatch with the vaccine, it’s still very important to get it.”
While this year’s vaccine isn’t a perfect match to the subclade K strain, a preliminary analysis from the U.K. found it offered at least partial protection, lowering people’s risk of hospitalization.
The CDC and major medical societies recommend a flu vaccine for almost everyone age 6 months and older. Despite recent misinformation and confusion about vaccines, the flu recommendations haven’t changed.
Flu is particularly dangerous for people 65 and older, pregnant women, young children and people of any age who have chronic health problems, including asthma, diabetes, heart disease and weak immune systems.
Health officials are urging people to stay home if sick.
“If you’re sick, don’t get other people sick,” Wu said. “When people are sick and they’re going into work or going to a party or going to school, and they’re getting other people sick, that may be fine for some of the general population. But when you spread it to somebody who may not do well — let’s say I got you sick … you gave it to somebody else, and then that person gave it to their grandmother, who passed away — people don’t see that downstream effect.”
Most people can treat the symptoms of the flu at home, but issues like breathing problems and chest pain should be evaluated by medical providers, physicians said.
“If you’re having generalized symptoms but you’re able to stay hydrated and control fever and body aches with over-the-counter medications, you can probably continue to do that in conjunction with a primary care doctor,” Hellstrand said. “But once you start having worsening of symptoms, including not being able to drink and stay hydrated, significant respiratory distress or feelings like you can’t breathe, chest pain, vomiting — those are times when you probably need to escalate care by being seen in the hospital.”

(Photo by Will Steinfeld/New Hampshire Bulletin)A federal judge has allowed four New Hampshire residents to join a legal fight with the Trump administration over access to the state’s voter file.
Magistrate Judge Andrea Johnstone of the U.S. District Court of New Hampshire ruled Monday that the residents could join the Secretary of State’s Office in opposing efforts by the U.S. Department of Justice to force a handover of state voter information.
Moving forward, the residents — liberal activist Louise Spencer; former Republican state Rep. Neal Kurk; former Democratic state Rep. Bob Perry; and Portsmouth attorney Christopher Cole — will be treated as co-defendants against the federal lawsuit.
“Even assuming that the proposed intervenors’ interest is adequately represented by defendants, their presence in this suit will assist the court in the just and equitable adjudication of this matter,” Johnstone wrote. 
The Trump administration has been requesting states’ voter files this year, with the federal Department of Justice arguing it needs to make sure states are properly vetting voter eligibility. Justice Department attorneys say they are entitled to the information due to the Help America Vote Act of 2002 and the Civil Rights Act of 1960. 
But despite multiple requests by the Trump administration, New Hampshire Secretary of State Dave Scanlan has refused to provide the voter file, pointing to state law that restricts the file to political parties and candidates. 
In September, the Justice Department challenged Scanlan’s refusal in federal court in Concord. 
The lawsuit is still pending. But days after it was first filed, Spencer, Kurk, Perry, and Cole filed a motion seeking to intervene. 
The residents argued their privacy rights as voters were being directly threatened by the federal government’s attempt to obtain the voter file, which includes voters’ addresses and party affiliation and can include confidential information like Social Security numbers and driver’s license numbers. And they said they needed to be represented as defendants because New Hampshire officials might otherwise attempt to strike a deal with the Trump administration that could violate residents’ privacy interests. 
After initially opposing the residents’ inclusion as co-defendants, Justice Department lawyers reversed course in December, telling the court it had “no position” on the matter. That reversal came days after the U.S. District Court of Michigan approved a similar request for two voters and the Michigan Alliance for Retired Americans to intervene as co-defendants with the state. 
In a statement Tuesday, Spencer said she was “pleased.” 
“It is important for New Hampshire voters to have an opportunity in court to advocate for our privacy rights and the security of our sensitive personal information,” she said. “We should not have to sacrifice our privacy rights when exercising our fundamental right to vote.”

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)In yet another sign of exploding inequality, a new data analysis finds that while affordability is an urgent issue for average Ohioans, the richest Americans keep getting richer. A lot richer.
The analysis by the Institute for Policy Studies said that the 935 billionaires in the United States saw their combined wealth grow by nearly 21% in 2025, to $8.1 trillion. The group used data from the Forbes Real Time Billionaires list to do the analysis. 
For comparison, the median family of four in Ohio saw its income increase less than 6% in part of 2025 when compared to the same period a year earlier, according to Census Bureau figures used by the U.S. Justice Department in bankruptcy proceedings.
Meanwhile, prices for consumers have charged ahead, leaving them further behind. 
The analysis referred to a poll conducted for Politico in December. Among other woes, it found that half of those surveyed found it difficult to afford food, 27% skipped a medical checkup due to financial worries, and 23% skipped taking prescription medications for the same reason.

While millions struggle, the analysis by the Institute for Policy Studies found that the richest billionaires have been doing particularly well. 
The 15 richest billionaires saw their combined wealth jump from $2.4 trillion at the beginning of 2025 to $3.2 trillion a year later. That’s a 33% increase in wealth.
When President Donald Trump signed the so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” last summer, it likely accelerated growing inequality, researchers have found. 
The bill made the 2017 tax cuts permanent, adding $4.1 trillion to the federal debt by 2035, while providing $1 trillion in benefits to the richest 1% of Americans over the same period. The bill also cut more than $1 trillion in programs for the poor, including Medicaid and federal food assistance.
Omar Ocampo, a researcher at the Program on Inequality and the Common Good at the Institute for Policy Studies, said the very rich are already paying taxes at much lower rates than average Americans.
“It’s not just that U.S. billionaires are entering 2026 with record-breaking increases in extreme wealth: it’s that they are also paying far less in taxes compared to the huge amount of wealth they amass,” he said in a written statement. 
“Average taxpayers like you and I pay income tax at triple the rate of the wealthiest Americans. Not only are a small number of Americans holding more wealth than the rest of America, but they’re also not paying their fair share of taxes.”
Perhaps not surprisingly, some of the very richest American billionaires did especially well last year, according to the analysis:

Elon Musk of Tesla, X and SpaceX, had $726 billion, up from $421 billion at the beginning of 2025. That’s a 72% increase.
Larry Page, Google co-founder, had $257 billion, up from $156 billion a year ago. That’s a 65% increase.
Sergey Brin, another Google co-founder, saw a 60% increase to $237 billion.
Larry Ellison, co-founder of Oracle, saw a 17% increase to $245 billion.
Jeff Bezos of Amazon saw a 4% increase, to $242 billion.

All of the top five are heavily involved in artificial intelligence. 
Ohio and many other states are providing huge tax subsidies to build data centers to support AI despite the fact that the centers work with skeleton staff and support few jobs. At the same time, the centers’ huge power demands have caused average consumers’ utility rates to spike.

(Photo from Google Maps.)This story was originally published by Canary Media.

In landmark rulings in November, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio ordered FirstEnergy’s three regulated companies to pay roughly $250 million for violations linked to the state’s largest-ever utility corruption scandal. More than $186 million of that will be refunded or credited to consumers.


It’s one of the biggest such penalties in U.S. history. The rulings in three cases represent ​“an important milestone in fixing the harms FirstEnergy caused,” said Ohio Consumers’ Counsel Maureen Willis — even though the relief comes more than five years after her office first asked regulators for accountability and falls well short of what she and others pushed for.


The utility corruption scandal surrounding FirstEnergy and House Bill 6 isn’t just the largest in Ohio history — it also ranks up there nationwide, where such occurrences have happened more often than regulators or consumers would want.


As part of the scheme, FirstEnergy paid roughly $60 million in bribes to pass the law bailing out unprofitable nuclear and coal plants, and then to thwart Ohioans’ constitutional right to a referendum on it. FirstEnergy also admitted that it paid $4.3 million to Sam Randazzo shortly before he became chair of Ohio’s utilities commission in 2019, with the understanding that he would provide favorable treatment for the company.


A lawsuit and subsequent legislation halted HB 6’s nuclear subsidies before they began. But the law’s coal subsidies lasted five and a half years, up until this August, costing consumers approximately half a billion dollars in all.


On July 21, 2020, just about a year after Gov. Mike DeWine (R) signed HB 6 into law, federal agents arrested former Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder (R), former Ohio Republican Party Chair Matt Borges, and others in connection with the bribery scheme. Householder and Borges were found guilty of federal racketeering charges in 2023.


The Nov. 19 rulings by the utilities commission, also known as the PUCO, mark the first time FirstEnergy’s utilities will pay anything to Ohio and its consumers for regulatory violations related to HB 6.


The company previously paid $230 million under an agreement with the Department of Justice to resolve a criminal charge, plus another $100 million to settle federal securities claims, and $20 million to avoid state criminal charges. The company also paid nearly $50 million to settle a class action lawsuit.


 Ripples in the rate cases

On the same day as its HB 6 rulings, the PUCO also approved a rate hike for some of FirstEnergy’s customers, albeit one much smaller than what the company initially requested. Regulators granted an annual increase of nearly $76 million for approximately 745,000 customers served by the Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co.


Meanwhile, rates will fall for customers of Toledo Edison and Ohio Edison by $24.4 million and $17.4 million per year, respectively. All told, regulators approved a net rate increase of about $34 million — far less than the combined $183 million FirstEnergy asked for.


Consumer advocates had pushed for regulators to go further. The Office of the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel — the state advocate for utility consumers — sought rate decreases totaling roughly $132 million for FirstEnergy customers, including a cut in the company’s rate of return to account for the poor management that enabled the HB 6 corruption scheme.


“FirstEnergy’s executive decisions contributed to increased financial risk, and it is unfair for its consumers to bear this burden through higher electric bills,” Willis said, adding that shareholders should shoulder the cost. ​“Reducing the profits built into rates is also a way to ensure accountability.”


Regulators ultimately rejected that approach.
Yet another battle over FirstEnergy’s rates will probably play out this year, and the HB 6 scandal will likely loom over that process, too.


The day after the PUCO rulings came out, FirstEnergy announced that its three Ohio utilities will file their next rate case in early 2026. So, different rates from the ones just approved will likely kick in as early as 2027.


“FirstEnergy’s announcement does not come as a surprise,” Willis said. That’s because legislation passed earlier this year calls for an end to most bill riders and speeds up rate cases. At least one company has already filed a new rate case under the law.


FirstEnergy’s utilities could use their new rate case to revisit some issues from the recently decided one.


All in all, ​“customers of Ohio Edison and Toledo Edison should be wary of the lower bills” they’ll get after last month’s rulings, said Dave Anderson, policy and communications manager for the Energy and Policy Institute, a watchdog group.

They’re an improvement for now, he said, but may not last.


 The book is not yet shut on HB 6

The PUCO’s rulings in the HB 6 cases also stopped far short of the relief sought by consumer and industry groups, which would have topped half a billion dollars.


And while regulators held that another corporate-separation audit should begin within the next three years, they refrained from providing a full review of FirstEnergy’s management practices, which advocates have sought since 2020.


Nonetheless, the $250.7 million in penalties and refunds imposed by regulators ​“are significant and welcome,” said Tom Bullock, executive director of the Citizens Utility Board of Ohio, a nonprofit watchdog group.


For their part, PUCO Chair Jenifer French and Commissioner Lawrence Friedeman each conveyed relief that the three HB 6 cases had wrapped up. ​“As this journey began, the commission has expressed an unequivocal intent to follow the facts wherever they led, and today we reached the destination,” Friedeman said at the Nov. 19 meeting.


But, as one of the commission’s rulings notes, another case has yet to be addressed. Five years ago, in response to calls for investigations following the initial arrests of Householder, Borges, and others, the PUCO — then led by Randazzo — took the ​“baby step” of ordering FirstEnergy to show that it did not use money from Ohio customers for its HB 6 efforts.


FirstEnergy’s utilities bear the burden of proof in the case. It may be difficult for them to prove the negative, because FirstEnergy had mixed funds from different sources in a money pool. It’s also unclear how much of a penalty regulators will impose if the companies can’t demonstrate that they followed a state law banning use of customers’ money for political or charitable purposes.


Written testimony in that case is due next month, and an administrative trial, called an evidentiary hearing, is set to start on Feb. 24.


Overall, Ohio’s rulings on the HB 6 saga so far have been a mix of good news and bad news when it comes to holding utilities accountable, consumer advocates say.


“What we’ve learned from the whole HB 6 affair was that there was an extremely lax attitude towards regulation [at] FirstEnergy and the other majority utilities in Ohio … that enabled the scheme to be played out,” Anderson said.


He is encouraged by the commission’s decisions last month, which reflected less deference to utilities and more serious financial consequences than past rulings.


“What the PUCO did do here that was quite strong was find FirstEnergy broke multiple Ohio laws,” Anderson said. The assessed penalties also include several instances where the commission levied fines of $10,000, $16,000, or $25,000 per day for different violations, which added up to tens of millions of dollars. If regulators in Ohio applied that approach all the time, not only in the wake of scandal, ​“it would provide utilities with a strong disincentive to take things as far as FirstEnergy did,” he added.


Beyond that, criminal charges remain pending in state and federal court against two former FirstEnergy executives. Whether the outcome of those cases will reduce the incidence of future utility scandals remains to be seen.

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)Maine lawmakers are again considering whether to create a separate department to handle child welfare matters after years of turmoil within the office. 
On Tuesday, Sen. Jeff Timberlake (R-Androscoggin) introduced LD 555 to create a new Department of Child and Family Services during a public hearing before the Legislature’s Health and Human Services Committee.
The proposal would set the stage to transfer the state’s child welfare system, which currently operates as the Office of Child and Family Services under the state’s Department of Health and Human Services, to its own department. It would have a commissioner appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Legislature.
Timberlake introduced a similar bill two years ago that was passed by the Maine Senate, but ultimately died. He said he is proposing it again because “the underlying problems it seeks to address have not gone away.”
Oversight panel suggests more than two dozen reforms for Maine child welfare system

In an October 2023 radio address, Timberlake said at the time he saw no other way forward than to separate child welfare from DHHS and reform it “into its own department to properly execute its focused mission of protecting Maine’s families.”
He isn’t the only one who has pushed for this change. The late Bill Diamond, a former Democratic senator from Windham, proposed legislation about five years ago to separate the agency from DHHS after similar conversations around the state’s failing to keep children safe from known abuse and neglect.  
Although DHHS had expressed openness to the idea the last time Timberlake proposed it, the department testified against LD 555, saying it is unaware of evidence that this would be in best interest for children. Instead, it argued that separating child welfare from the larger department would offer less cohesive support for children in state custody. 
Melissa Hackett, coordinator of the Maine Child Welfare Action Network, did not testify for or against the proposal, but said her concerns outweigh her support of the measure, adding that a new department is “not a silver-bullet solution.” She also said she hasn’t seen any research indicating that restructuring would benefit children and families and added that these changes could be challenging to implement at a time when the agency is already strained.
Between 2021 and 2024, roughly 30 children died each year, according to state data. That includes children who died as a result of homicide or whose families had involvement with the state child welfare system, including accidental deaths. Prior to those years, 2019 saw the most child deaths dating back to 2007 with 19.
The proposal has bipartisan support with two Democrats and another six Republicans as co-sponsors, including Sen. Joe Baldacci (D-Penobscot), who told the committee Tuesday that this is a human, not partisan issue.
Having served on the Legislature’s Government Oversight Committee for many years, Timberlake said few other issues have consumed as much time and attention as the shortcomings of the state’s child welfare system.
The legislative watchdog scrutinized the Office of Child and Family Services during the 131st Legislative session and came up with more than two dozen suggested reforms for the agency in May 2024. 
Since then, the Office of Child and Family Services has reported to work on implementing those policy changes and recommendations from lawmakers. The agency’s director has been providing quarterly updates to the Health and Human Services committee to keep them updated on the progress.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/state-signs-16-Large-1024x682.jpeg,,,2026-01-07 04:57:55.670460

She died Dec. 31. (Photo by Mark McCormick)Josephine Vonceal Pace “Jo” Brown visited my high school back in the 1980s. The administration at good ol’ North High invited her to speak about her historic career as the first Black woman to chair Wichita School Board. 
We learned that day that the Mrs. Jo spoke hard, even painful truths wrapped in her unique brand of sophistication. No one had the status nor the courage to censor her. Her voice carried. 
She told the auditorium about the Wichita she’d lived through, including a practice of allowing Black students to swim only late on Fridays, after white students. Staff then drained and refilled the pool, to save white students from swimming in the same water. 
That story landed hard. We were the last generation of youth whose parents were shaped in a pre-civil rights America. We understood this historically, but Mrs. Jo made us feel it. 
That will moor much of her legacy: standing 10-toes or high-heels down on truth and giving people the kind of cultural equilibrium to speak loud and true about what hurts.
She died New Year’s Eve at 96, unwilling to let the year end before having her final say. 
Years later, as a columnist, my reference to that pool story in a column ignited a reader firestorm. White, Jim Crow-era graduates claimed that the pools weren’t segregated.  
Letters begat calls for a retraction and for me to be fired. I dug in as the newspaper brass pressed me to relent. 
Enter Mrs. Jo. 
“They’re after you, aren’t they baby?” 
“Yes, ma’am.” 
She said, “Humph,” with a resolve in her voice. The cavalry had arrived. 
“Here’s what you do,” she said. “You go down to the Central Branch Library. Go into the Special Collections desk and ask for a book written by Sandra Van Meter.”
Mrs. Jo explained that as board chair, she’d commissioned a book documenting the district’s history and that in one of the chapters, we’d all learn the truth, and it proved worse than anything I’d shared. 
The district literally had convened discussions about building a separate school to keep Black students and white students out of the same water. The district never built that separate building but maintained the strange water-purity practice. 
Similar stories existed from Wichita to Salina to progressive Lawrence and into the South. Heather McGhee, in her 2021 book, “The Sum of Us,” shared how Montgomery, Alabama, paved over its municipal pool — that Black taxes help build — rather than integrate it. 
It’s precisely this kind of history many Americans today would banish rather than face. Their revulsion at this black-and-white image of themselves offers a brutal contrast to the lived experience of Black residents only allowed to skate or visit dentists on certain days. 
Mrs. Jo fought against such practices, and she’s partly the reason I prioritize telling various historic and social truths regardless of the often-frightening backlash. 
The point was not for her to forever stand behind me but to show me how to stand on my own. Much of the courage I stood on, whether calling out a school bus company or a police website humiliating women, came from her. 
Imagine what she lived through, not just as an educator following the Brown decision, but in a district that considered foregoing federal funds rather than integrating. Letters from white parents who didn’t want “n-words” teaching their children. 
Despite that, she offered a warm smile and regal kindness. She never seemed bitter, just resolutely unbothered. When I read this stanza in “Still I Rise” — 
 “Does my haughtiness offend you?
Don’t you take it awful hard,
‘Cause I laugh like I’ve got gold mines
Diggin’ in my own back yard.” —
 it reminded me of Mrs. Jo. In a society expecting her to dim her light, Mrs. Jo set the night sky ablaze with searchlights. 
 When she confronted the yet lingering vestiges of that era, at a bank or a store, she would correct them as she might one of her tiny students. Firmly but gracefully. 
 “You don’t pay and beg, baby,” she told me once. 
She could be blunt, but not cruel. Her advice pinched your heart but fixed your vision. She often attributed her ability to speak so boldly to her husband, the late Dr. Val J. Brown Sr., whose medical practice sheltered her from reprisals. 
That voice. It bridged eras and will outlast us all. She used that voice to help so many people and guided still more toward finding their own.

Ohio is at an energy crossroads. It forged America with steel and manufacturing, but our state is now facing the challenge of how to meet soaring electricity demand from AI facilities, data centers, and a growing central Ohio population, while also achieving state-level energy independence. And that’s all without driving up costs for working families.
One answer lies, quite literally, overhead.
Solar power represents one of the most practical, cost-effective, and job-creating opportunities available to Ohio.
It strengthens the grid, lowers long-term energy bills, and supports our manufacturing base.
From Mansfield to Toledo to Columbus, our steelworkers already produce the racking and components that support solar arrays across the country. This industry is where American labor meets Ohio ingenuity.
When electricity is produced near the point of consumption — whether homes, businesses, or factories — it eliminates the need for costly transmission upgrades that end up on ratepayers’ bills and avoids importing energy from other states.
One advantage solar installations offer is offsetting demand during peaks, like hot summer afternoons when utilities rely on expensive “peaker” plants to fill the gap.
By offsetting that demand, solar reduces grid strain and keeps energy costs down for everyone.
The need is urgent.
Ohio’s data center and AI boom has placed enormous pressure on local grids, water systems, and energy bills. A key study showed that these facilities now contribute around 95,000 jobs and $11.8 billion to our state’s economy.

At the same time, the electricity demand from these facilities continues to surge, with electric bills doubling for many Ohioans.
In places like New Albany and Dublin, local leaders are already weighing how to balance economic growth with infrastructure capacity.
Solar is the fastest and most cost-efficient way to meet that demand responsibly.
We’re up to the task. More than 26,000 Ohio families have already invested in solar.
Solar United Neighbors, a nonprofit that aids solar owners and supporters, has helped hundreds transition to solar through state-wide bulk purchase programs.
This local investment in solar is saving families money and fueling a growing homegrown industry.
Meanwhile, Ohio’s clean-energy workforce now boasts more than 100,000 jobs and 268 companies operating, specifically, in the state’s solar supply chain.
Terrasmart is one of those companies. It’s a leading solar racking manufacturer and installer that collaborates with 14 Ohio-based companies that supply steel, tubes, fasteners, galvanization, shipping, and installation services.
This is an example of how solar is feeding a state-focused supply chain while also employing more than 250 people in the Cincinnati area.
Every new array supports welders, fabricators, and electricians — the craftsmen who have long defined Ohio’s industrial spirit.
Expanding that workforce creates energy, strengthens small towns, and keeps prosperity within our borders.


That’s why state lawmakers are taking action.
In November, the Ohio House overwhelmingly passed a bill to expand community energy programs, which let Ohioans buy or lease shares in a shared solar project and get credits on their electric bills as if the panels were on their own homes.
For renters, apartment dwellers, and homeowners with shaded roofs, this reform offers a real way to take part in the energy economy. It expands ownership and helps local communities take charge of their power. The bill is now in the Ohio Senate.


Meanwhile, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio will soon determine how to share the costs of powering the state’s expanding data-center industry. Yet without additional local generation, those costs risk being passed along to everyday consumers.
This is a matter of economic foresight, not ideology.
Passing a community energy bill, supporting domestic supply chains, and aligning state and federal incentives will both protect ratepayers and secure Ohio’s role as a manufacturing leader in the 21st century.
The sun shines on every community in Ohio. Harnessing its power is practical and rightly typifies the belief that the nation’s energy future should be built here at home.

Wes Moore and Kenneth Naylor with Atlantic Pacific Cos., discuss future development in the Capitol Heights area near its Metro station. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)After his proposed housing legislation stumbled in the 2025 General Assembly, Gov. Wes Moore (D) unveiled a package of bills for the 2026 session that last year’s critics were giving a tentative thumbs-up Tuesday.
While there is likely “compromise waiting to happen” on parts of the package, an official with a lobbying group for Maryland county leaders, a key opponent last year, said county officials hope to come to agreement with the Moore administration on this year’s housing legislation.
“I think 2026 will be a different story,” said Michael Sanderson, executive director for the Maryland Association of Counties. “We’ve had a lot of conversations leading up to this year, and I think that’s been productive.”
Sanderson’s comments follow Moore’s unveiling Tuesday of his 2026 housing legislative package, a slate of housing development bills that he says will help reduce the state’s 94,000 housing unit shortage.
The presentation came at the Capitol Heights Metro station in Prince George’s County, to highlight part of his plan that includes a priority to encourage new development around high transit areas, including mixed-use housing, among other measures.
In 2026, affordable housing is needed ‘now more than ever,’ but getting there is the challenge

“We know that outdated zoning laws and bureaucratic red tape – they will limit housing supply, that they will cause a lack of affordability,” Moore said. “That’s why you will see on Jan. 14, our administration will continue to implement the most aggressive housing policies this state has seen in a generation, and we will do it unapologetically.”
His Maryland Transit & Housing Opportunity Act would eliminate parking minimums for housing developments within a quarter mile of transit, focusing on rail services. The bill would also delay collection of impact fees or excise taxes until after housing construction near transit is complete, among other measures.
Moore’s event coincided with the announcement of a contractor to redevelop the area around the Capitol Heights Metro station, and early renderings of the project.
“Today represents a new way that we are going to have these conversations, because this station represents the heart of the Blue Line corridor,” Moore said, referring to the Metro line in Prince George’s County that runs from the District line to the Downtown Largo station.
“For too long, we have seen how this has been acres of asphalt, a parking lot that just sits empty while the demand for housing skyrockets,” he said.
The state selected Atlantic Pacific Cos. to redevelop the area with approximately 300 new homes and 10,000 square feet of retail. Moore said that the development around the Capitol Heights station should serve as an example for the type of development his transit-oriented housing legislation would support.

Another one of the bills, called the Starter and Silver Homes act, would prohibit local jurisdictions from issuing minimum lot size requirements, allowing  developers to create smaller properties that serve as starter homes and homes for elderly people looking to downsize.
“Right now, local mandates require lot sizes that are so large, the only thing you can build is a huge home,” Moore said. “Not everybody needs a huge home, nor wants one.”
“It offers a measure of flexibility and freedom to stop shutting out Maryland’s working families and stop shutting out Maryland seniors from having the opportunity for home ownership,” he said.
The last piece of Moore’s housing package would reignite a battle around “vesting rights” for developers, meaning they would have a guarantee they can build on a property once a project is approved and that the project would be subject to the laws and policies in place at the time of its application. Vesting rights were part of Moore’s unsuccessful effort to push housing development legislation in the last session.
The 2025 legislation, which initially aimed to tie housing development to areas with high job growth, immediately came under fire from MACo because it limited county government say over some housing decisions.
The bill did not get its first hearing until March, in the back half of Maryland’s 90-day legislative session. It was heavily rewritten, replacing the administration’s proposal with language that granted vesting rights for developers, among other measures. It ultimately died in the Senate Energy, Education and Environment Committee as time ran out on the session.
Sanderson said that last year’s vesting right legislation “fell apart.”
“I feel like there is a compromise waiting to happen,” he said on vesting rights. “We’ve been talking very aggressively over the last several months, all pointing toward ‘let’s get something done.’ So I’m optimistic that we’re going to find a path to ‘yes’ on a lot of issues that have been elusive up to this point.”

Patrick Wolff
Patrick Wolff, a Democrat, is running for insurance commissioner. He is a financial analyst and investor and was a U.S. chess champion and an international grandmaster. 


With the first anniversary of the devastating Southern California wildfires approaching, CalMatters asked candidates for the 2026 state Insurance Commissioner race to share thoughts on what the state can do to help victims and stabilize insurers. This is the first of several candidate responses.
California’s insurance regulation is dysfunctional because politicians with no relevant qualifications keep running for Insurance Commissioner as a stepping stone.
I am a lifelong Democrat with over two decades of insurance and financial experience, first building an auto and home insurance brokerage business, then working as a financial analyst. This is my first run for elected office, and I will not run for any other office if elected. 
My only ambition is to fix what Sacramento has broken.
Solving our insurance crisis starts with reorienting the California Department of Insurance. It is too lax regulating insurance companies’ behavior, yet too strict controlling their market access. Customers lose both ways. My plan flips the script, holding insurance companies accountable while increasing choice and competition. 
The recently formed Smoke Claims & Remediation Task Force is an example of failing to hold insurance companies accountable. Modern wildfires cause unprecedented smoke damage, requiring new coverage standards. But reporting reveals the task force unacceptably favors insurance companies over science. I will create a new, unbiased task force to issue trustworthy standards and then make insurance companies follow them.
Another failure of accountability is claims payments. The state insurance department collects Market Conduct Annual Statements, identifying insurers who unfairly delay or deny claims. However, the insurance industry has lobbied to anonymize this data, shielding individual companies. I will have the insurance department release company-specific data and publish a claims performance report card for each insurance company, empowering customers to reward good actors and punish bad actors.
Customer empowerment requires robust choice and competition, yet the insurance department strangles both with bureaucratic red tape. Insurance companies filing product or rate changes wait 300 days for review versus 60 days in other states, and with much less predictable decisions than any other state because the department micromanages every case.
These endless delays and capricious rulings are disastrous, leading to insurers canceling policies and leaving California. I will streamline filing timelines and reserve strict reviews only for special cases as needed. Insurance companies will flock to our gigantic market once they have clear rules providing the reasonable certainty and flexibility they need to operate economically. 
As more companies come, more choice and competition will follow.
With strong regulation holding insurance companies accountable and empowering customers, ample choice and competition will prevent price gouging. But to hold ourselves accountable that the market is working and pricing is fair, I will publish an annual benchmarking report comparing California to all other western, fire-affected states.
As insurance becomes plentiful in California again, people will no longer need to turn to the FAIR Plan in desperation. Nevertheless, the FAIR Plan remains necessary and must be bolstered. I will require all insurance companies doing business in California to invest in improving FAIR Plan service. In return, we must allow FAIR Plan rates to become fully actuarially sound, as required by statute. This will stabilize FAIR Plan finances and incentivize customers to get better and cheaper coverage in the regular market.
Fixing insurance regulation can hold insurance companies accountable, provide transparency, make insurance widely available, prevent price gouging and stabilize the FAIR Plan. But to bring costs down to where they belong, we must aggressively reduce wildfire risk.
To protect homes, the state must provide clear home hardening guidance that aligns with insurance company underwriting and comes with accompanying discounts. Since home hardening helps everyone but burdens the homeowner, the insurance department must develop financial assistance programs homeowners need and deserve. 
Statewide, the way to sustainably lower the cost of wildfire risk — plus save lives and property — is to take better care of our forests. It is outrageous that our state government has allowed wildfire risk to get so bad. As Insurance Commissioner, I will fight relentlessly for better forest management.
California needs and deserves a functioning insurance system. With the right leadership, we can finally make insurance work the way it should for everyone in California.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)A House Republican is charging back into a continuing fight over vaccines and doctors that created a huge rift during last year’s legislative session.
Rep. Jeff Holcomb late last month filed HB 917, a proposal that takes aim at doctors who refuse to treat patients based on their vaccination schedule while also delving into other contentious health care treatment disputes.
The administration of Gov. Ron DeSantis backed a similar bill last year championed by Department of Health Secretary and State Health Officer Dr. Joseph Ladapo, but the vaccine provision was stripped from the bill.
In an email to the Florida Phoenix, Holcomb said he “feels strongly” the bill will pass this year.
Spring Hill Republican Rep. Jeff Holcomb (Photo/Florida House of Representatives)
“We saw during the Covid pandemic that medical decisions were made without proper safety measures. We have a similar situation with the childhood vaccine schedule. The vaccines our children are mandated to have do not have sufficient safety studies. This was confirmed yesterday with CDC shrinking the recommended childhood vaccine schedule,” he said, referencing the decision Monday to shrink the recommended number of childhood vaccines from 17 to 11.
Holcomb’s bill doesn’t eliminate any vaccine mandate now in Florida statute or rule. 
The bill does amend Florida’s Patient’s Bill of Rights and Responsibilities to make clear that a health care provider or facility cannot discriminate against a patient based upon the patient’s vaccination status. 
Additionally, Holcomb’s bill would add “vaccine status” to the list of reasons protected in law why patients cannot be discriminated against. That list now includes race, national origin, handicap, and source of payment.
The bill would allow the DOH or the appropriate licensing board to discipline providers who discriminate against patients based on vaccine status. The penalties in law vary from restricting, suspending, or revoking a license to imposing administrative fines or both.
Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics President Rana Alissa, a Jacksonville physician, said the association does not support HB 917.
“When you have somebody that is unvaccinated and coming with fever, what if that patient has measles? If they are going to come and be in the waiting room with people who have leukemia, or for any reason they do have a lower immune system, they are going to expose them to measles,” Alissa said.

Physician’s offices aren’t designed to safely accommodate unvaccinated patients, she said.
“You have to change the way clinics are built. You have to have a different waiting room, you have to have a different stairs, you have to have a different elevator. You have to have negative-pressure rooms to accommodate these unvaccinated kids when they have signs and symptoms of the illness,” she said. 
“You want to force them to take unvaccinated kids? Then you have to help them reconstruct their clinics and you have to basically accommodate them accordingly.”
The language is identical to what the DeSantis administration pushed for last year in a far-reaching bill that addressed an array of Department of Health-related issues, from background screening requirements for staff at medical marijuana treatment centers to physician licensure requirements.
While HB 1299 ultimately passed and was signed into law by the governor, it didn’t contain the anti-discrimination language the DeSantis administration wanted.
Another vaccine-related provision in HB 917 left over from the 2025 session addresses messenger ribonucelic acid (mRNA) vaccines.
The Legislature in 2023 passed a law that banned governmental entities, business establishments, and educational institutions from discriminating against someone based on mRNA vaccination status. Essentially, the law banned the use of vaccine passports in Florida. But it was valid only through June 2025.
 The DeSantis administration tried unsuccessfully last year to make the ban permanent in HB 1299, but the Legislature refused to go along. Lawmakers did agree, however, to extend the ban through June 2027. HB 917 would make the ban permanent.
No vax, no mask, but still service

DeSantis in September criticized the Legislature for refusing to go along with his health-care proposals. Specifically regarding the mRNA provisions, DeSantis said: “That’s got to be made permanent. I mean, everyone is glad that we did that. Even the far left, I don’t hear them, at least publicly they won’t admit they’re for vaccine passports. It doesn’t make sense. So, they need to do that.”

The governor and Ladapo said over the summer that they want to eliminate all vaccine mandates from Florida statutes. That would require legislative buy-in that isn’t clear the governor and Ladapo, his state health czar, can expect.
In the meantime, the DOH has proposed changing its rules regarding vaccine requirement for school and day care, specifically removing requirements for children to receive the hepatitis B, varicella (chicken pox), and haemophilus influenza B or Hib vaccine. The DOH is proposing to also eliminate those vaccines, along with the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for admission to a licensed day care facility.
It held a lengthy public meeting on the proposed rule changes in December.
Vaccines maintained, disclosure added 
HB 917 wouldn’t eliminate any vaccine mandate from statute. But the legislation would require every licensed health care provider authorized to vaccinate children to advise parents and legal guardians of the “unique risks, benefits, safety, and efficacy of each vaccine included on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Child and Adolescent Immunization Schedule.”
Holcomb’s bill would require health care providers to give parents and legal guardians the option of following “alternative vaccination schedules that may consist of not more than one injection or oral administration at each encounter.”
Parent and legal guardians would be required to sign a document attesting they have been provided the requisite immunization information.
 Behind-the-counter ivermectin

HB 917 would authorize pharmacists to sell ivermectin “behind the counter,” which means pharmacy assistance wouldn’t needed to obtain the product.
Ivermectin is an effective treatment for parasites in animals and for use by humans to treat parasites such as head lice and scabies, according to the National Institutes of Health. The FDA has not approved  Ivermectin for treatment or prevention of COVID-19, and so far recommends against taking it for COVID-19, instead suggesting people get vaccinated for protection.
Nevertheless, there was buzz during the pandemic about using it for treatment for COVID-19.
HB 917 provides pharmacists who sell ivermectin from behind the counter with immunity from civil and criminal liability as well as disciplinary protections.
Specifically, HB 917 would authorize pharmacists to provide ivermectin to patients and customers as long as the pharmacist provides written information about the indications and contraindications of the use of ivermectin and the appropriate dosage for using ivermectin. The information must advise the person to seek follow up care from a primary care physician.
There is no age restriction in HB 917 for the purchase of ivermectin. Holcomb has also filed HB 29, to legalize over-the-counter sale of ivermectin. That means it wouldn’t be limited but freely accessible.
HB 29 has been referred to three House committees. There is no Senate companion.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/FL-hospital.jpg,,,2026-01-07 00:12:15.716874

Yet, in his Nov. 24 opinion, “Time for Connecticut to rethink its climate strategies,” Noah Kaufman includes this quote: “The difficulty lies not so much in developing new ideas but in escaping from old ones. ” The opinion’s subtitle, “A lot has changed in climate policy over the last few years — meriting a new path,” tips off the reader to the “old is new, up is down” nature of his essay.
Kaufman’s “new idea” is for Connecticut to be less ambitious in its climate strategies and goals that are described in the Governor’s 2021 Executive Order but are now, apparently, an “old idea.”  It’s hard to believe that plans laid out less than five years ago are old.  But the approach becomes clearer in Kaufman’s statements:  “Under Trump, the U.S. is retreating from domestic decarbonization and actively undermining global efforts,” and Connecticut should “recalibrate its goals to better align with today’s economic and political realities.”  
In other words, retreat from the path forward because it has encountered bumps in the road.  Instead, Kaufman recommends that Connecticut stick with the actual old and familiar habit of using fossil fuels no matter how sick they make us (cancer, asthma, worsening of other respiratory diseases) and what the cost (destruction of forests and wildlife, pipeline leaks, increased cost of natural gas).
Should Connecticut, along with Rhode Island, have accepted the stop-work order from the Trump administration for the Revolution Wind project, a 704-megawatt wind farm, even though the project was fully permitted and 80 percent complete?  Would the loss of wind energy and all the construction and operating jobs have been a wise decision?  Does Kaufman disagree with the state’s evaluation that “Strategic investment in our port assets, a history of advanced manufacturing, innovative technology and research and development capabilities, have uniquely positioned Connecticut to serve as a first-mover in this new industry, already serving as a launchpad for three offshore wind projects supporting three states?”
No, to Connecticut’s credit (for example), it didn’t fall for Trump’s “I hate wind,” approach and instead pursued and won a federal judge’s decision ordering work to resume on the Revolution Wind project.  Work resumed on September 22, and the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management did not appeal the restart.  Connecticut refusing to bow to today’s supposed economic and political realities. On December 22, the Trump administration again halted construction of the project, along with pauses against four other offshore wind farms on the East Coast, for the reported purpose of evaluating national security concerns.
Once again, Connecticut is fighting back. The governors of Connecticut, New York, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island “are demanding either a briefing on purported security threats or an immediate lifting of stop work orders on five offshore wind projects under construction, including the Revolution Wind project.” In addition, Attorney General William Tong released a statement objecting to the stop work order and declaring that, “We are evaluating all legal options, and this will be stopped just like last time.” These actions show what the “new idea” really is – for Connecticut to be bold and courageous in pursuing a clean energy future.
The state should move rapidly to adopt other clean technologies that are being aggressively pursued by other states, such as solar in many forms, solar plus battery storage and geothermal networks.  The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported that solar is expected to contribute more than half of new electric generating capacity planned for 2025, with battery storage accounting for almost 20% of the remaining capacity additions.  These increases reported year over year will build the solar and battery capacity quickly.
Connecticut should also move promptly to build its geothermal network capacity.  Connecticut has been cautious and slow to move forward with geothermal networks, which are considered one of the most efficient ways to heat and cool buildings.  Our neighboring states are ahead of us, and we can learn from their experiences.  In fact, even in “today’s economic and political realities,” Massachusetts and New York are moving forward on several geothermal projects.  The nation’s first utility-led geothermal heating and cooling network in Framingham, MA, whose first section was completed in 2024, recently announced that an $8.6 million grant from the US Department of Energy will provide funding for the network to double in size.  A Boston-based nonprofit is the lead recipient of the funding, and Eversource and the city of Framingham are co-recipients.
Connecticut should also move rapidly from “studying” solar canopies (required by 2025 legislation) to building them.  Tremendous capacity is available on parking lots and other usable spaces near transmission connections.  Solar canopies can provide other benefits such as battery storage, reducing heat islands, protecting cars, and directing the flow of rainwater.
So yes, we should be clear about what are “new” ideas and what are “old” ideas, and we should work hard to develop the true new ideas for clean and renewable energy instead of backsliding on our climate goals and commitments.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-07 05:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,American Democracy needs religion — not less,Andrew Fowler,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/07/american-democracy-needs-religion-not-less/,"The United States may not have been founded strictly as a Christian nation, but Christian values are intrinsically linked to American democracy.","In a recent editorial, John Hall suggests  that religion is an obstacle to American democracy — a relic of “magical thinking” that breeds conflict, division, and impedes progress, driven by modern “angry, defensive Christians.” His perspective echoes the utopian vision evoked in John Lennon’s “Imagine:” if only there was “no religion too,” humanity could finally live in peace.
However, this dismissive argument misunderstands both American history and the culture’s present realities. Far from threatening democracy, as the headline “Can religion harm democracy?,” implies, religion has been the impetus for constructing the nation’s moral, legal, and civic fabric — and must be a cornerstone of civil society.
Indeed, the core American principles — that “all men are created equal” and limited government — were not borne from Thomas Jefferson’s pen in 1776, but rooted in a classical and Judeo-Christian tradition: that every person, from the powerful to the lowly, has an inherent dignity (or inalienable rights) because they were made in God’s image and likeness.
Although the United States may not have been founded strictly as a Christian nation, nevertheless, Christian values are intrinsically linked to American democracy. In the colonial period, many settlers emigrated  to the New World to escape faith-based persecution and, thus, enshrined the freedom of religious expression  into their charters, which would later appear in the First Amendment. Religiosity also compelled settlers to craft governmental frameworks and list rights in written documents like the Fundamental Orders of 1639 — one of the earliest, and perhaps first written constitutions of a democratic government, which had been adopted  in Connecticut.
As Matthew Spalding notes in The Making of the American Mind, it was “Christianity that largely transmitted the classical tradition, which meant natural-law reasoning, to the modern world.” Indeed, that there are “divine laws that exist prior to, outside of, and above the laws of the state” means the state’s laws are “limited and controlled by a higher or transpolitical authority.”
To an extent, Hall is accurate when expressing the Founding Fathers’ skepticism of religious fanaticism and deistic leanings. Yet they were not irreligious — or even opposed to religious practice. In fact, John Adams clearly  emphasized  the U.S. Constitution was “made only for a moral and religious people,” emphasizing, “It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.”
Moreover, the Founders’ predominant concern was not with religious fanaticism, but countering direct democracy, which they  equated  to mob rule and tyranny. As a result, the American republic did not merely implement checks and balances on various government branches, but  humanity’s fallen nature  — and proclivity to abuse power to bludgeon the opposition.
Decades after the Constitutional Convention, Alexis de Tocqueville — who also favored a separation of church and state — concurred with the Founders. Writing in Democracy in America, he saw religion “no less the companion of liberty in all its battles and its triumphs; the cradle of its infancy, and the divine source of its claims,” adding, “The safeguard of morality is religion, and morality is the best security of law and the surest pledge of freedom.”
The virtues of peaceful coexistence, social justice, and the Golden Rule also stem from religious fervor and tradition. Historically, these values have fueled  charitable giving; equality under the law; the abolition of slavery; the construction of hospitals, universities, and schools; scientific discovery; to even the establishment of free market economic practices, which raised more out of poverty  than its antecedents.
More than simply binding a people together, as Ian Speir argues  in Mere Orthodoxy, religion has been the means of cultivating virtue by governing one’s passions, and fostering a robust civil society. On the latter, a plethora of organizations were inspired by faith like the Salvation Army, Knights of Columbus, the American Red Cross, Samaritan’s Purse, and even the YMCA. As a nation, the U.S. government has a long-storied history  of granting public funding toward humanitarian aid and nonprofits. This impulse, no doubt, was spurred on by a Christian sense of duty to thy neighbor.
In short, the West has been, and continues to be, “utterly saturated by Christian concepts and assumptions,” as Tom Holland notes in Dominion:  How the Christian Revolution Remade the World. And when an injustice does occur, like racism, greed, murder, sexual assaults, or other crimes, we predominantly view it through this moralistic lens.
Yet, in recent decades, religion’s withdrawal  from the public square has not yielded good fruit sociologically. Coupled with the rise of secularization, New Atheism, and modern therapeutic deism, Americans are — coincidentally (or perhaps, consequently) — gripped by a persistent “happiness crisis ,” particularly among younger demographics. However, scientific evidence suggests that religious people are generally happier  and live longer. Indeed, prayer produces psychological benefits: reducing stress, loneliness, and fear, as well as increased connection to community 
But in the past few years, more Americans are religiously unaffiliated  (“nones”) than in previous decades. This poses a significant risk to the health of American democracy since “nones” are “less civically engaged and socially connected than people who identify with a religion,” according to a Pew Research Center survey  released in January 2025.As churches and civic associations close, there will be fewer opportunities to volunteer and collaborate — and, therefore, fewer interactions devoid of politics. The timing could not be worse. Polarization has intensified: most Americans disagree on “ basic facts;” nearly two-thirds  believe the country’s political culture is incapable of solving problems; and about a third  believe violence “may be necessary to set the country on track.”

These realities should give us pause. The erosion of religiosity in American democracy presents an existential crisis. Nonetheless, Hall ascribes the tense political landscape to Protestant fundamentalists’ “disdain” for secular liberals, progressive gender ideology, women’s rights, and the sciences, like vaccines and evolution. Moreover, he criticizes the right’s moral lapse in supporting Donald Trump, who he calls a “political demagogue.” Yet he is unfair to those on the religious right who have felt persecuted over the years, embodied by cases like Masterpiece Cakeshop, the Little Sisters of the Poor, the FBI spying on traditional Catholics, and even Coach Joe Kennedy’s public prayer.
And in a twist of spiritual irony, during the pandemic, the government deemed liquor stores to be essential , but not houses of worship. Point being, the religious right’s frustration is not without cause — and Trump has appealed to their plight more so than Democrats. This has not gone unnoticed by prominent Democrats, like U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock from Georgia, who believe the party has “ceded  ” religion to Republicans.
Ironic, still, is that Hall views these policy disagreements as a threat to democracy — yet disagreement is inherent in America’s republican government. It is a “messy, difficult, and essential struggle,” which he astutely recognizes. After all, no two people think exactly alike. Everyone possesses a unique, individual mind. However, prior to the United States of America, most governments failed to elevate individuality, favoring the authoritarian ‘might makes right’ rule.
Ultimately, any utopia, like the one imagined in John Lennon’s famous song, is impossible. Nevertheless, Lennon’s idealism persists in reducing belief into a coping mechanism for death, while promoting a new age deism. Yet faith-based hope, more so than secularization, has been a powerful force when earnestly lived, accomplishing incalculable good for untold millions be it the poor, marginalized, sick, dying, the uneducated, and the unborn.
The inherent dignity of others, enshrined in our founding documents and born from a religious tradition, has made possible the potential to pursue happiness more so than most persons throughout human history. That is worth protecting and safeguarding.
In truth, a nation unmoored from these values would be catastrophic to sustaining American democracy as we know it. The proof is in the empirical evidence.
So, no — religion is not harmful to democracy; in fact, it’s imperative.

What makes this moment different is the speed, scale, and breadth of change, and the absence of a coordinated response. If we fail to act, we are not witnessing inevitable progress; we are permitting displacement by design.","I WAS RECENTLY watching “Landman,” a television drama set in the oil fields of Texas, where generations of families have made their living on the rig. In one scene, workers attend an industry showcase filled with cutting-edge equipment meant to represent the future of drilling.
One machine stood out. It was a robotic drilling system, precise, tireless, and exact. It performed the same work these men had done for decades, the same work their fathers and grandfathers had done before them.
One worker looked at it and asked, “What is that?”
Another answered quietly, “That’s the machine that replaces us.”
That line has stayed with me because it captures a reality we are only beginning to confront. Artificial intelligence and automation are no longer abstract concepts or distant threats. They are actively reshaping the labor market, often faster than workers, educators, and policymakers can respond.
For years, much of our economic anxiety has been directed outward, toward globalization or immigration. But the most disruptive newcomer to the workforce does not cross borders or need housing. It works around the clock, does not get sick, does not take family leave, and never asks for a raise.
Artificial intelligence is already transforming how, and whether, people work.
Recent reporting underscores this shift. Major employers including Best Buy, American Airlines, Amazon, and Adidas have announced layoffs or restructuring tied to automation and efficiency efforts. These are not isolated incidents. They reflect a broader corporate strategy to improve margins by reducing labor costs through technology.
To be clear, innovation and efficiency are not inherently bad. Businesses must evolve to remain competitive. But there is a growing gap between technological advancement and the responsibility companies owe to the workers who helped build them. Long-time employees are increasingly treated as expendable, replaced by systems that promise savings but remain largely unproven at scale.
This pattern is not just economically disruptive; it is socially destabilizing.
As a teacher, I see the consequences of economic insecurity up close. Many of my students’ families depend on multiple jobs to survive. Losing even one source of income can trigger a cascade of consequences, missed rent, utility shutoffs, food insecurity, and, in extreme cases, homelessness. When jobs disappear suddenly, families do not have time to adapt.
The risks extend well beyond traditionally “replaceable” work. Technology ethicist Tristan Harris, who helped sound the alarm about the harms of unchecked social media, has warned that AI-driven displacement will hit entry-level workers especially hard. These are recent college graduates and young adults who rely on early career jobs as their entry point into economic stability. If those rungs disappear, upward mobility disappears with them.
Even highly skilled professions may not be immune. In medicine, for example, AI-assisted precision is already being explored in surgical settings. Faced with a choice between a machine that never tires and a human surgeon operating after long hours with little rest, insurers and patients alike may gravitate toward automation. The logic is understandable, but the workforce implications are profound.
This is not an argument to halt innovation. It is an argument for guardrails.
Massachusetts has long prided itself on being a leader in both technology and labor standards. That tradition now demands action. Policymakers must ensure that automation does not simply externalize costs onto workers and communities. That means requiring transition planning, investing in retraining that leads to real jobs, strengthening unemployment protections, and holding corporations accountable when automation results in large-scale displacement.
Without such safeguards, we risk allowing efficiency to become a euphemism for abandonment.
Technology has always changed work. What makes this moment different is the speed, scale, and breadth of change, and the absence of a coordinated response. If we fail to act, we are not witnessing inevitable progress; we are permitting displacement by design.
The machine I saw on that oil rig did more than drill holes. It exposed a question Massachusetts must now answer: Will innovation serve the public good, or will it erode the very workforce our economy depends on?
The answer will shape not just our labor market, but the stability of our communities for generations to come.

With votes still being counted in one of the four counties that comprise Senate District 26, Wade Dunn, a retired businessman who received the endorsement of the late Sen. Gary Stubblefield’s family, was in the lead. Brad Simon, a businessman who outspent all of his opponents, was in second. However, if current margins hold, neither candidate will the majority needed to win the nomination outright.
Franklin County posted unofficial final vote tallies by publication time on its Facebook page, and Logan County provided unofficial final vote counts directly to the Advocate. Johnson County reported partial results on the Arkansas Secretary of State’s website.  Sebastian County posted final unofficial results on its website.
“We feel this race is headed to a run-off and that we are well positioned to be in that run-off,” Dunn wrote on his campaign’s Facebook page Tuesday night.
Brad Simon (Courtesy of the Arkansas Secretary of State)
Simon said in a text message to the Arkansas Advocate that he was going to “wait on the final numbers, digest everything, and sleep on it.” He did not immediately respond to follow-up questions.
The five Republicans in the race were vying to replace Stubblefield, who died in September. Stubblefield was an outspoken opponent of the prison, which is set to be built in the district on a 815-acre property the state purchased in 2024, and was one of several senators who repeatedly voted against appropriating $750 million in state funds for its construction in 2025. The winner of the Feb. 3 Republican runoff will face independent candidate Adam Watson in the March 3 special election for Stubblefield’s seat.
Dunn, Simon and the other three candidates — former state Rep. Mark Berry, Stacie Smith and Ted Tritt — were united in opposing building a prison project in Franklin County and other issues such as cutting taxes, though their positions on alternatives to building the prison in the county were less unified. Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders in 2024 announced the state had bought 815 acres in the county for the planned 3,000-bed facility.
Sanders has said the prison is needed to address state prisons being over capacity. Critics say the state didn’t consult locals about the plan and that the site doesn’t have the infrastructure needed for such a project.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_5973-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-06 23:57:19.644206
,Mississippi Today,2026-01-07 04:11:18+00:00,Mississippi Today,Miami Hurricanes have two Mississippi connections – and one is quite large,Rick Cleveland,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/06/miami-hurricanes-mississippi-connections/,"Miami tight end Elijah Arroyo, left, celebrates with offensive lineman Markel Bell, second from left, after after scoring a touchdown during the first half of an NCAA football game, Saturday, Sept. 7, 2024, in Miami Gardens, Fla.","SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. – There are few connections where the Miami Hurricanes and the state of Mississippi are concerned other than Miami plays Ole Miss Thursday in the Fiesta Bowl.
But there are two interesting ones:

Delta native Markel Bell, former Cleveland Central and Holmes Community College standout, plays left tackle for Miami and protects quarterback Carson Beck’s blind side. Bell is, in a word, gigantic: 6 feet, 9 inches and 345 pounds. He will wear jersey number 70. Trust me, you cannot miss him. He will be the largest human being on the State Farm Stadium field Thursday night. And he’s more than just big. He’s really good. Through 14 games this season, Bell has not allowed a single quarterback sack and has allowed only one quarterback hit.
Miami offensive coordinator Shannon Dawson has Mississippi connections. No. 1, his first job as an offensive coordinator was at Millsaps College, right there on State Street in Jackson, back in 2006-07. There he worked for former Alabama head coach Mike Dubose and mentored the late Juan Joseph, the quarterback who eventually won the C Spire Conerly Trophy, the only Division III player to ever win the honor. No. 2, Dawson spent three years at Southern Miss, where he mentored Nick Mullens, who broke many of Brett Favre’s passing records and has gone on to a 10-years-and-counting NFL career.

Rick Cleveland
Unfortunately, Bell was not made available to the media here during Miami’s press conference Tuesday, but Dawson was. So naturally this Mississippi reporter asked Dawson about the only Mississippi native on the Miami team. Instantly, Dawson’s eyes lit up.
“Well, first of all, he is one large human being, and he is one helluva football player,” Dawson said. “Our offense is built around that offensive line. Those guys are our engine, and he’s one of our best. He is also a terrific young man, who has grown in so many ways in his two years at Miami.”
Bell is a prototypical rags-to-riches story. Most Division I football players are either 3-star, 4-star or 5-star recruits. Bell came out of Cleveland Central with zero stars. That’s right: zero, none, null set.
So Bell went to Holmes CC, where he began to attract attention. Let’s face it, when a 6-9, 345-pound player walks into a room – or onto a field – he gets noticed. Apparently, Bell’s rapid improvement in Goodman – and his obvious potential for more improvement – attracted a whole lot of attention. He made first-team all-star and first-team all-region and received offers from Ole Miss, Mississippi State, Auburn, Arkansas, Louisville and others.
How did he end up at Miami?
“He flew on a plane,” Dawson said, laughing at his own joke. “No, seriously, he came to us on a visit and loved the place. He picked us, and I’m glad he did.”
Ole Miss defensive coordinator Bryan Brown said when you turn on tape of the Miami offense you can’t help but notice Bell. “He is one gigantic human,” Brown said. “I mean, he is long and thick. And for a guy his size, he can really move. He’s a load.”
Dawson, a native of Clinton, Louisiana, fondly remembers his stints at Millsaps and Southern Miss. 
“I was a graduate assistant at New Mexico State when I got the call from Millsaps,” Dawson said. “It was my first chance to be an offensive coordinator. They had really struggled offensively. We got pretty good, won nine games one year. It helped to have a guy like Juan Joseph at quarterback.”
Dawson says he learned a lot about running an offense at Millsaps, and one of the lessons was quite painful. Remember the game that became known as “Lateralpalooza.” If you were there or have seen the tape, you will never forget it. Trinity and Millsaps were both nationally ranked. Millsaps led Trinity led 24-22 late and was trying to run out the clock. But the Majors turned the ball over on downs with two seconds left at the Trinity 40. And that’s when Trinity lateraled the ball 15 times en route to a 60-yard game-winning touchdown. The play became nationally famous on “ESPN SportsCenter” and all the various highlights shows.

“Everybody remembers all those laterals,” Dawson said. “What I remember is that if I had managed the clock a little better, they would have never gotten the ball back to run that play.”
From Millsaps, Dawson’s career took him Stephen F. Austin, then to West Virginia and then to Kentucky. Fired as the offensive coordinator at Kentucky after one season in 2015, Dawson took the same job on Jay Hopson’s first staff at Southern Miss. USM’s first game of the 2016 season: at Kentucky. Dawson’s offense went up and down the Commonwealth Stadium Feld and the Golden Eagles won 44-35. Some revenges are sweeter than others.
After three seasons in Hattiesburg, Dawson moved to Houston for four seasons and then to Miami. This is his third season there.
Said Dawson of Ole Miss’s defense: “Those guys  play exceptionally hard. They are very athletic. Their edge guys can bend the edge, and they are very disruptive up front. They do a lot of movement, a lot of things that give people trouble. They probably do a little bit more of that movement lately and why they were so successful against Georgia.”
Dawson continued, “I think Ole Miss is a lot like us. They play hard, they get after it and they have really gotten hot at the right time. Should be a heckuva matchup.”
Ole Miss and Miami have played only three times, all before players began wearing facemarks on their helmets and none with anywhere the importance of this Fiesta Bowl.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/06173725/AP24251849921265.jpg,,,2026-01-06 23:12:21.326719

Rep. Amanda Nedweski (R-Pleasant Prairie) and Sen. Jesse James (R-Thorp) introduced the bill late last year after a report from the Capital Times found that there were over 200 investigations into teacher licenses stemming from allegations of sexual misconduct or grooming from 2018 to 2023. 
Nedweski spoke about the case of Christian Enwright, a former Kenosha teacher who pleaded guilty last year to over a dozen misdemeanor counts of disorderly conduct after he had an inappropriate relationship with a 14-year-old student, during the Assembly Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee hearing. 
“Unfortunately, the Christian Enwright story is all too common. For too long, these cases have been swept under the rug and child victims were put through a lifetime trauma, often knowing that the person who preyed upon them is likely out there doing it to another child,” Nedweski said. “The strong penalties in AB 677 serve as a stern warning and deterrent to bad actors. The bill ensures that adults who exploit positions of trust to manipulate and prey upon children can no longer hide behind misdemeanor charges or technical gaps in state law.” 
Under the AB 677, grooming would be defined as “a course of conduct, pattern of behavior, or series of acts with the intention to condition, seduce, solicit, lure, or entice a child for the purpose of producing distributing or possessing depictions of the child engaged in sexually explicit conduct.” 
Examples of behavior that would constitute grooming include verbal comments or conversations of a sexual nature directed at a child, inappropriate or sexualized physical contact; communication over text and social media to lure or entice a child; promising gifts, privileges, or special attention to lower a child’s inhibitions or create emotional dependence; and acts intended to isolate a child from family or peers.
While the bill was spurred in part due to cases involving teachers, the bill authors told the Assembly Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee that the bill would not just address grooming happening in the school arena. 
“It is important to remember that grooming can happen anywhere — grooming can happen anywhere, not just in our schools. This bill is not targeted at schools, but at grooming whenever and wherever it might happen,” James said. “I believe that it will have a strong deterrence effect. Clear criminalization of grooming behavior sends a strong message that predatory conduct will not be tolerated in Wisconsin.” 
A person convicted of a grooming charge, under the bill, would be guilty of a Class G felony. The charge would increase to a Class F felony if the person is in a position of trust or authority, and to a Class E felony if the child has a disability and to a Class D felony if the violation involves two or more children. A convicted person would need to register as a sex offender.
During the hearing, Rep. Jodi Emerson (D-Eau Claire) said she thinks the bill is important, but expressed some concerns about whether it could result in a “chilling effect” that would discourage people from taking on mentorship roles or interacting with children. She said she wanted to ensure that lawmakers got the definition of grooming correct.  
“I think that this is a bill that if we get it right, we are going to protect so many kids and if we get it wrong, we are going to put a lot of people at risk,” Emerson said. 
Nedweski said legislators should remember that the bill would be related to a pattern of behavior, not a one-time occurrence, that there would need to be the intention to “entice” a child and it would be up to a prosecutor to decide whether a person’s behavior fits the crime. 
“That’s why we work so hard to get the definition as right as we can,” Nedweski said, adding that she and her colleagues  have worked with law enforcement and prosecutors to develop the bill and looked at what other states have done. “Nothing is ever going to be 100% perfect, but I think we’re pretty darn close.” 
Rich Judge, DPI assistant state superintendent for the division of government and public affairs, registered in favor of the bill on behalf of the agency, though he did not provide testimony. DPI Superintendent Jill Underly has previously said defining grooming is one of the top steps the state can take to work to address the issue.

The winner of the primary will face Republican Bo Renshaw of North Little Rock in the March 3 general election.
Smith-Johnson and Holladay will have a rematch in the district’s regular primary, also on March 3, and the winner will face Renshaw again in the general election on Nov. 3. The winner of the November election will serve a two-year term in the Arkansas House beginning in January 2027. 
Data from the Pulaski County Election Commission showed 228 votes cast for Holladay and 59 for Smith-Johnson during the early voting period from Dec. 30 to Monday.
Early vote returns released Tuesday night by the Pulaski County Election Commission showed Holladay leading, but numbers from other precincts were not yet available.
Holladay lost to Wing in the November 2024 election by 316 votes. Smith-Johnson had never run for office before Wing’s resignation triggered the special election.

Both candidates told the Arkansas Advocate they support well-funded public education, affordable health care and expanding access to pre-K.
Holladay recruits health care professionals for the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. Smith-Johnson is an Air Force veteran and a prevention coordinator for the Army National Guard.
The winner of March’s general election will take office before April’s fiscal legislative session, which focuses on the state budget.
If the Democratic candidate wins in March or November, parts of North Little Rock and Sherwood will be represented by a Democrat in the House for the first time in 12 years.
Voters in the Arkansas River Valley’s Senate District 26 also went to the polls Tuesday to choose between five Republican candidates in their own special primary election. The winner will face independent candidate Adam Watson on March 3.

(File photo Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)A senior aide to former House Speaker Adrienne Jones has landed a new job just steps away from his old one.
Matt Jackson, who served for a year as chief of staff to Jones, will be named senior policy adviser to Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City).
The announcement is expected as soon Wednesday. Jackson will fill a vacancy created after Ross Seidman was elevated to senior counsel to Ferguson.
Jackson brings a deep knowledge of the budget to a staff that already includes Deputy Chief of Staff Jody Sprinkle. Gov. Wes Moore (D) and the General Assembly face a difficult budget year that includes a $1.5 billion structural budget deficit. The Senate will get first crack at the budget after Moore introduces it later this month.
Jackson was one of three senior aides fired, along with Jones’ Director of Legislative Affairs Michele Lambert and Communications Director Marty McGowan, by House Speaker Joseline Peña-Melnyk just days after she was elected to succeed former House Speaker Adrienne Jones (D-Baltimore County). Prior to becoming chief of staff in 2024, Jackson served as deputy chief of staff.
In addition to making leadership and committee appointments, Peña-Melnyk has spent the last four weeks rebuilding her staff in advance of next week’s start of the 2026 General Assembly, including the appointment Monday of Heather Mizeur as her communications director.
Healey hangs it up after 36 years
Del. Anne Healey (D-Prince George’s), the second-longest tenured member of the House of Delegates, announced Tuesday that she will not seek reelection this fall but will step down when her term ends next January, after 36 years in office.
In a lengthy statement, Healey gave no specific reason for stepping down, but recounted a tenure that saw historic firsts and sweeping change, in the county and the state.

“Over my 35 years in the legislature, I have seen our community grow more diverse, and I am proud to support policies that reflect and respect that diversity,” her statement said. “Bringing people together across differences has been among the most meaningful parts of my work, and it has been an honor to serve this community.”
Healey, first elected in 1990 after three years on the Hyattsville City Council, has been in Annapolis for six governors — William Donald Schaefer, Parris Glendening, Robert Ehrlich, Martin O’Malley, Larry Hogan and Wes Moore — and has served under five House speakers — Clayton Mitchell, Casper Taylor, Michael Busch, Adrienne Jones and, now, her “close friend and supporter” Joseline Peña-Melnyk.
She currently serves as chair of the House Rules and Executive Nominations Committee and previously served as co-chair of the Joint Committee on Administrative, Executive and Legislative Review and vice chair of the Ways and Means Committee. She was president of the Women Legislators of Maryland in 2022.
Healey cited a number of historic votes during her tenure, including the repeal of the death penalty and the recognition of same-sex civil union, as well as her honor in casting votes to elect Jones as the first woman and African American to lead either chamber of the General Assembly, and Peña-Melnyk as the first Afro-Latina and first immigrant to hold the job.
“My work in the General Assembly consistently focuses on opportunity and dignity for all,” she wrote. “I am a strong advocate for working people — supporting increases to the minimum wage, enacting paid sick leave, and standing with state employees, tradespeople, union members and low-income workers.”
“Serving the people of District 22 has been the honor of my life. I am grateful for the trust placed in me, proud of the work we have accomplished together, and confident in the future of our district, the Maryland House of Delegates, and the State of Maryland,” Healey said in her statement.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Alaska is expected to have moderate statewide job growth this year, led by continued expansion in the oil and gas industry and the health care sector, according to a new state forecast.
The Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development’s 2026 jobs forecast predicts an additional 3,000 jobs, amounting to 0.9% growth in employment for the coming year. That is  slightly lower than last year’s growth of 1.2%, according to the forecast.
“Alaska’s economic drivers are mostly strong going into 2026,” said the statewide forecast, written by state labor economist Karinne Wiebold and published in Alaska Economic Trends, the department’s monthly research magazine.
By percentage, the oil and gas sector is expected to be the state leader in job growth; the 1,000 new jobs expected this year would amount to an 11.1% increase over 2025 total.
Much of the expected growth is from Santos’ Pikka oil field, where construction is now completed and production is set to start this year. Additionally, there is a general upswing in industry activity, the forecast said.
Growth in the oil and gas industry is expected to bring job totals in that sector to an average of 10,000 for the year – still below the peak of 14,800 achieved in 2014 but about back to the level in 2019, the last year before the COVID-19 pandemic. Oil and gas employment fell to its lowest point in the pandemic year of 2021, at 6,700.
Lower oil prices are not expected to have much effect on job numbers, Wiebold said by email. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, oil prices have fluctuated widely, even as production in Alaska has been fairly stable, she said.

	An unknown factor that could dampen job growth, she said, has been created by ongoing ConocoPhillips layoffs. The layoffs are global and not targeted at the company’s Alaska operations specifically, so effects on the North Slope and elsewhere remain unclear.
Health care, construction still growing, but some sectors still losing jobs
The health care sector is expected to add the biggest number of jobs in 2026. The anticipated  1,100 new jobs amount to a 2.5% increase from 2025, according to the forecast. Health care has been a perennial employment growth leader, in part because of needs created by the aging of Alaska’s population, Wiebold said.
The construction sector is still expected to gain jobs, but not at the booming pace of the past two years. For four of the past five years, Alaska has received over $2 billion in federal capital funds, among the highest annual totals ever, the forecast ports out.
One of the major federally funded projects that is poised to start this year is the Port of Nome expansion. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in August awarded a $399.4 million contract for the first phase of the project, a 1,200-foot causeway extension with about 600 feet of new dock space. Further causeway and dock expansion, along with harbor deepening and other work, is planned in coming years.
Another big federally funded construction project, the new bridge and road reconfiguration at the Pretty Rocks landslide area at the midway point of the 92-mile Denali National Park road, is nearing completion, the forecast points out.
The transportation, warehousing and utilities sector, which is often related to construction activity, is expected to gain jobs, as well.
But some Alaska industries have yet to recover to pre-pandemic levels and are expected to continue to shed jobs this year.

	One of those is seafood processing, which accounts for most of Alaska’s manufacturing sector. The seafood industry has been in a long-term decline, but the coming year’s losses are expected to be modest compared to the past few years. A bright spot is the 2025 salmon harvest, which was much improved from the 2024 harvest.
A trouble spot is federal employment outside of the U.S. Department of Defense.
The state lost 300 non-military federal jobs last year, and the forecast predicts that another 400 will be lost in 2026.
Southeast Alaska, where a smaller percentage of the federal jobs are military, “is likely a bit more vulnerable to federal job cuts than other parts of the state,” Wiebold said.
Overall, Southeast Alaska is expected to lag behind other parts of the state in employment. The region is expected to actually lose about 100 jobs this year, amounting to a 0.3% decrease, according to a regional analysis that accompanied the statewide analysis.
Elsewhere, state analysts expect increases. Expected job growth in the Matanuska-Susitna Borough is 1.3% and 0.8% in both Anchorage and Fairbanks, according to regional projections.
One statewide factor that poses uncertainty is the failure by Congress so far to continue subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, the forecast said. If there is no action to change that situation, as many as 25,000 Alaskans will face sharply increasing health insurance costs, the forecast said. “Beyond dampening demand for health care, this could significantly reduce households’ ability to spend on other needs, with spillover effects across sectors,” the forecast said.

Advocates, including ballot co-sponsor Jo Giles at podium, host a launch event in Omaha. Jan. 5, 2026. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — Advocates seeking an amendment to the Nebraska Constitution to “protect” and make it harder to tweak citizen-initiated laws, such as those around payday lending, gambling, minimum wage, paid sick leave and medical cannabis, will start gathering signatures this week for the 2026 ballot.
Proponents see the changes as necessary in light of recent legislative action or inaction on voter-backed laws. But some advocates of recent ballot measures and a few state senators said they worry about unintended consequences.
The new group, “Respect Nebraska Voters,” kicked off its 2026 campaign this week in Omaha. If successful, the effort would increase the threshold of lawmakers required to change voter-approved laws from 33 state senators (two-thirds) to 40 (four-fifths).

Nebraska’s officially nonpartisan one-house Legislature has 49 state lawmakers.
Former State Sen. Al Davis, a Sandhills rancher, helped lead a 2020 measure to cap payday lending rates. It passed with about 83% of the vote. He is now a co-sponsor of Respect Nebraska Voters and said the push could be important for the future of ballot measures.
“I fear we’re now in the unfortunate place where many everyday Nebraskans are left wondering if initiatives matter at all, or if lawmakers will simply reach for the eraser after every election,” Davis said. “I believe we can restore trust and do better by putting more power in voters’ hands.”
Petition specifics
If successful, the higher threshold for changes would apply to any ballot-passed laws approved since 2004 or beyond.
In 2004, voters set a threshold to tweak voter-enacted laws at 33 for any changes, no matter the magnitude, rather than 25 (a simple majority). The ballot measure passed with 55% of the vote. Thirty-three votes is the same threshold to shut off debate on contentious issues.
Constitutional amendments, which can’t be changed by the Legislature without a statewide vote, would largely remain unaffected. That includes a 2024 ballot measure banning most abortions after 12 weeks. Petitioners seeking constitutional amendments must secure more signatures than efforts around state statutes.

Attorneys with Respect Nebraska Voters confirmed the Legislature, under that amendment, could further restrict abortion with 25 or 33 votes, regardless of whether the 40-vote threshold is approved.
‘Didn’t come out of nowhere’
Dawn Essink, another sponsor of Respect Nebraska Voters and a previous volunteer for the minimum wage and paid sick leave campaigns in 2022 and 2024, said the effort “didn’t come out of nowhere.” She pointed to 2025 legislation to weaken both laws she fought for.
“They think Nebraskans don’t understand,” Essink said of senators. “They have said that we didn’t really know what we were voting for, or, even better, that the ballot language was confusing. That says a lot about what they think of the people they’re supposed to be representing.”
Under the group’s proposal, only legislation to facilitate and “safeguard” voter-enacted laws, and which “advance a compelling state interest by the least restrictive means,” could be passed by the Legislature after a successful ballot measure. That could set up new legal challenges.
The effort also constitutionally seeks to prevent the Legislature from making ballot measures tougher to run with new state laws. It would not address constitutional requirements for signature gathering.
“Such laws may include neutral, ministerial and administrative laws necessary to facilitate the fair, orderly and efficient administration of these powers, but no law shall be valid that conditions, restricts, burdens or otherwise impairs the exercise of these powers,” the proposed constitutional amendment states.

Jo Giles, executive director of the Women’s Fund of Omaha and the third of the group’s sponsors, said the effort is needed to protect Nebraskans’ rights to decide for themselves. Giles was one of the ballot sponsors for the paid sick leave campaign in 2024, which would have guaranteed paid sick leave for all workers beginning Oct. 1, 2025, until lawmakers stepped in.
Raising the threshold, Giles said, is a “common-sense safeguard that will ensure elected officials respect the will of voters.”
“The bottom line is simple: Nebraskans know what’s best for our communities. We make thoughtful decisions at the ballot box,” Giles said. “This amendment will ensure those decisions are respected.”
‘Responsible implementation’
Shelley Gillen, a medical cannabis advocate for more than a decade with Nebraska Families 4 Medical Cannabis, said she worries the effort could instead lock in legislative gridlock on complex issues. She helped the successful 2024 push to legalize and regulate the medicine.
Supporters of medical cannabis joined together in support of two related ballot measures for the 2024 general election at a public hearing for Initiative Measures 437 and 438 at the University of Nebraska at Omaha on Oct. 25, 2024. Among those in the photo are Dominic Gillen, far left, and Shelley Gillen, left front row, who is kneeling by their son, Will Gillen. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
She said when voters are unhappy, the answer isn’t to “freeze” policy or create additional barriers that could slow progress for patients and voters.
“We believe in respecting voters, but respecting voters also means ensuring their decisions can actually be implemented,” Gillen said. “On issues like medical cannabis, this amendment would make responsible implementation and necessary adjustments far more difficult.”
State Sen. Beau Ballard of Lincoln had worked with paid sick leave supporters and some businesses for “minor adjustments” in 2025. A spokesperson for the paid sick leave campaign said the group was “not concerned with” Ballard’s original proposal.
Broader changes from State Sen. Paul Strommen of Sidney that he said were needed to make the law “workable” later merged with Ballard’s bill. The package passed 33-16 and ultimately helped spur Respect Nebraska Voters.
‘Double-edged sword’
State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair continues to work with medical cannabis advocates to try to aid implementation of the 2024 laws. A 2025 bill fell short 23-22, well short of the current 33-vote threshold.

In 2026, Hansen said he’s still working to get to 33 for some tweaks, such as ensuring the voter-created Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission has a proper rollout and doesn’t further hinder Nebraskans’ ability to get medicine. Hansen’s 2025 efforts faced stiff opposition from Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers and U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., among others.
“It’d be hard enough to get 33 people to vote for it, let alone 40,” Hansen said of medical cannabis proposals. “It’s kind of a little bit of a double-edged sword.”
Giles, asked specifically about medical cannabis, said she and other coalition members feel similar frustration over medical cannabis implementation and hope legislators act.
“We know that elected officials can do the right thing at any time, and so we hope, for them, that there is an easier process to upholding the will of voters,” Giles said.
80% threshold for voters?
State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of Omaha, chair of the Legislature’s Business and Labor Committee, which forwarded the proposed changes to the minimum wage and paid sick leave initiatives to the full Legislature in 2025, said lawmakers are watching the Respect Nebraska Voters campaign.

If an 80% threshold is good for lawmakers, Kauth wondered Tuesday whether lawmakers should require ballot measures to pass with at least 80% of the vote, too.
Since 2004, just one ballot measure exceeded 80%. That was in 2020, to cap payday lending costs.
A ‘single subject’
Legalized gambling advocate Lance Morgan, the president and CEO of Ho-Chuck, Inc., the economic development wing of the Winnebago Tribe, said he also had concerns about the Respect Nebraska Voters effort. 
Morgan’s company helped fund 2020 ballot measures to authorize casino gambling and games of chance. He said it was one of the most economically impactful ballot measures for the state, but there was room for tweaks.
Changes to voter-approved laws might also be necessary with the Nebraska Constitution’s requirement that ballot measures, as well as legislative bills, can only deal with a “single subject,” Morgan said.

In 2020, there were three gambling measures on the ballot — one constitutional amendment and two state laws — and the Nebraska Supreme Court invalidated a medical cannabis constitutional amendment on “single-subject” grounds. 
The justices have given greater deference in defining a “single subject” with legislation than with initiatives.
As a result, ballot measures are often broader than legislative bills likely would be, absent the legislative negotiations and compromises and facing an up-or-down statewide vote at the ballot.
“I think that, given the situation in Nebraska, the fact that you have a really hard single-question rule, you’re going to need to have some sort of flexibility built into the system,” Morgan said Monday. “Or you’ll have trouble actually implementing what you want to do.”
State Sens. Eliot Bostar, Jason Prokop and Stan Clouse pushed for the Legislature to act in 2025 on sports betting for a narrower bill, and earlier legislative proposals for paid sick leave and medical cannabis that stalled were similarly narrow at first.
If the Legislature doesn’t act in the next few months, Morgan said he and supporters of legalizing online sports betting will pursue the 2026 ballot.

Morgan said the Respect Nebraska Voters effort might be a “step too far” and acknowledged making tweaks “shouldn’t be easy, but it shouldn’t be impossible, either.”
State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln told 10/11 News in December she’s unsure whether Respect Nebraska Voters could be targeted over the single-subject clause. Giles had said she thinks the group is OK, as the focus is on increasing the vote threshold for ballot initiatives.
Referendums, legislative operations
Conrad had also said an existing “remedy” is a referendum campaign or voting out lawmakers. She told 10/11 she worries Respect Nebraska Voters could make it harder to fix technical flaws or address implementation, or spur competing initiatives.
Paid Sick Leave for Nebraskans, for example, elected not to pursue a referendum in 2025.

The Respect Nebraska Voters changes would not prevent lawmakers from reinstating measures that voters repealed in referendum campaigns. Voters have reversed three legislatively passed laws since 2004: bills to dissolve Class I schools (2006), end the death penalty (2016) and set aside tax dollars for private school costs (2024).
Hansen said he wonders about a “slippery slope” in ballot measures dictating legislative operations, such as moves to prohibit secret ballots for legislative leadership or change the threshold needed to pass contentious legislation over minority opposition.
‘Unexpected consequences’
Davis, a one-term senator from Hyannis, said a legislator’s job is to write laws, though he said there are “rare circumstances” where it might be appropriate to amend past voter-enacted laws.
“But only after seeing them take effect and noticing unexpected consequences,” Davis said.
Giles and supporters estimated the changes under the Ballard-Strommen bill removed voter-approved paid sick leave protections for roughly 140,000 workers, including 14 and 15 year olds, workers in businesses with fewer than 10 employees and temporary or seasonal agricultural workers.
Employers can still choose to offer paid sick leave to those employees.

Giles said it’s “pretty clear” there was not a compelling interest in a bill that “gutted” earned time off.
Asked whether the 40-vote threshold was a risk worth taking, as it would require another ballot measure or 40 votes to expand paid sick leave, Giles said, “I don’t think it’s a sacrifice. I think it is respecting the will of the people.”
Giles and Essink said opponents of the 2024 paid sick leave campaign didn’t fund an opposition campaign, and the measure passed with 75% support among voters. Giles said business and “special” interests then went to “friends” in the Legislature to fight. 
Minimum wage and campaign finance
Giles acknowledged the group’s effort would likely increase campaign spending on the front end, a prospect that worries State Sen. Jane Raybould of Lincoln. 
Raybould, a former grocery store executive now in her 16th and final year of public service, is lead sponsor of a bill to cap annual increases to the minimum wage, changing what voters approved and set to begin next year and aimed at matching increases in the cost of living. Raybould’s bill would instead lock in minimum wage bumps at 1.75%, smaller than average inflation in recent years, though a guaranteed increase, saying it would make the increases easier for businesses to handle.

The bill remains one vote away from passing and, if it maintains its supporters, would have 33 votes to pass in 2026. She described her bill as having an “incredibly compelling economic impact.”
Speaking with the Examiner on Monday, Raybould said she worries the new ballot initiative “ties the hands of the Legislature,” which works with voters who are often described as Nebraska’s “second house.” 
“I thought we were a co-equal branch of government,” Raybould said, “working together, collaboratively and cooperatively, for the benefit of the majority of our fellow Nebraskans.”
Raybould said no senator disrespects the “will of our voters,” whose choices at the ballot box also empower Nebraska’s 49 senators to govern. She worried about future harmful ballot measures lawmakers might have a harder time counteracting, if needed. 
‘Proteger nuestra libertad de votar’
Lu Turco, a current junior at Millard North High School, asked voters Monday to get out and help young workers through Respect Nebraska Voters, teens he said are “first” on lawmakers’ list to roll back pay. Raybould’s minimum wage bill would create a “youth training wage” for workers aged 14 or 15.

Turco said the ballot measure could make a difference for the next generation.
“Labor is labor, regardless of who is doing it,” he said. “Unfairly undercutting young workers is harmful, especially after voters made it clear that they wanted these rights and wages for everyone.”
Perla Ochoa, a South Omaha community organizer with Heartland Workers Center, said Tuesday: “Estar recolectando firmas para proteger nuestra libertad de votar sobre los temas que afectan a nuestras comunidades. Esto se trata de proteger los derechos y los salarios de los trabajadores y mucho más.”
It means, “We are collecting signatures to protect our freedom to vote on the issues that affect our communities. This is about protecting workers’ rights and wages, and much more.”
Other supporters of the campaign include the Nebraska State AFL-CIO, League of Women Voters of Nebraska, Nebraska Appleseed, Civic Nebraska, Voices for Children in Nebraska, Nebraska Civic Engagement Table and Second House Collaborative.
Respect Nebraska Voters would need valid signatures from 10% of registered voters by July 2, or at least 125,000. The signatures must include at least 5% of registered voters in 38 of Nebraska’s 93 counties.
Asked why the 40-vote threshold plus additional constitutional language is the solution, Giles said it’s already a “huge lift” to reach the ballot.
“It should also be a huge lift for lawmakers to undo the will of voters.”
 




Reaching the ballot in Nebraska
Nebraska has two types of statewide ballot measures: initiatives and referendums. Initiatives create or amend state laws and constitutional amendments, while referendums repeal all or part of recently passed state laws. Both types are voted on during general elections in November.
Signatures for initiatives are due four months before the election, while signatures for referendums must be gathered within 90 days of the end of a legislative session in which a targeted law was passed.
Minimum signature thresholds are different for referendums and initiatives:

To repeal state laws: 5% of registered voters (if 10% or more, the law is suspended until the election).
To amend or create state laws: 7% of registered voters.
To amend or create state constitutional provisions: 10% of registered voters.

All ballot measures also require geographic distribution of gathered signatures, from 5% of registered voters in 38 of Nebraska’s 93 counties, in addition to the bulk requirement.
As of Jan. 1, there were 1.25 million registered voters in Nebraska. The total signatures needed are calculated when signatures are due. That’s July 2 for 2026 initiatives, for state laws or constitutional amendments.

Sanchez, 50, a five-term member of the city’s Common Council, will succeed Bobby Sanchez, a Democrat who resigned the House seat after winning the open race for mayor in November.
Results collected by the Democrats showed her winning by nearly a 2-1 margin in a district held by Democrats for more than half a century. Turnout was low, with fewer than 600 votes cast.
The representative-elect emigrated from Carolina, Puerto Rico to New Britain in 1994, settling in a House district that now is 56% Latino. Her predecessor, who is no relation, recruited her to run for council a decade ago.
Vaughan, 51, had first run for the seat in 2024, winning 29.9% of the vote against Bobby Sanchez. The showing was the best by a Republican in recent cycles.
Once the results are certified and she is sworn in, Democrats will outnumber Republicans in the House, 101 to 49, with one vacancy to be filled in a special election next week in the 139th District of Ledyard, Montville and Norwich.
The vacancy was left by the death of Rep. Kevin Ryan, D-Montiville, on Nov. 23.

Tim Walz speaks at a news conference touting the launch of Minnesota's paid family leave program in Minneapolis on Jan. 6, 2026. (Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer) A day after ending his campaign for a historic third term — and possibly his political career — an animated Gov. Tim Walz offered a preview of how he plans to spend the remainder of his term: defending his record, shoring up his legacy and hammering Republicans with the abandon of a man no longer chasing votes.
“For Republicans here, I have more energy than I’ve ever had. I am committed to this state more than I’ve ever been,” Walz said. “Expect for the next 11 months for me to ride you like you’ve never been ridden to make sure you’re doing your job.”
And then, “Republicans want to tear the state down. Republicans want to tell you it’s too dangerous to walk down the streets. Republicans want to tell you there’s nothing good comes out of Minneapolis (and) St. Paul. Republicans want to tell you everybody with brown skin is stealing money or that they’re not welcome here. They want to do nothing to improve this state.”
Walz was speaking at a news conference in the Coliseum Building in south Minneapolis to celebrate the launch of the state’s new paid family leave program — on time and under budget, according to his Department of Employment and Economic Development.
The program will be a defining accomplishment of his tenure as long as it isn’t enveloped in fraud and abuse like that which has plagued other state-run programs under his watch.
He said he had faith in the safeguards against paid leave fraud and would take accountability for any failures of the program — as well as its successes.
“If the buck stops with me on when there’s problems, the buck stops with me on successes,” Walz said. “Not a single Republican supported this. So every Minnesotan from here on forward, whoever uses this program, there is no bit of thanks that would go to Republican legislators.”
He chastised President Trump for leading a “petty, vile administration that doesn’t care about the well-being of Minnesotans,” in the wake of a freeze on federal child care funding and the deployment of thousands of immigration officers in what the Department of Homeland Security is calling its largest operation ever.
He condemned Republican candidates for remaining silent after Trump shared a video to Truth Social promoting a wretched conspiracy theory that Walz ordered the assassination of his friend and colleague, former House Speaker Melissa Hortman. (The Hortmans’ grown children issued a statement Sunday pleading with Trump to remove the video.)
“They are unwilling to stand with Melissa Hortman’s children, and I want to tell you this for those legislators who went and shed crocodile tears at her funeral, shame on you,” Walz said.
The return of the Walz of the euphoric, early days of the 2024 presidential campaign as Kamala Harris’ running mate might seem surprisingly defiant coming a day after what was surely one of the worst days of the worst years of his political career.
But with the indefatigable optimism that has long been his trademark, Walz said he has plenty of time to shore up his legacy by rooting out the fraud and helping a Democrat win in November.
“I have a year to continue to improve on a record that I think will stand up against anybody’s, a record that has made Minnesota better, a record that makes people want to come here, and a record that (has) respected not only the dignity of people, but the idea of rule of law,” Walz said.
After he leaves office next year at 62 years old — still young for a politician — Walz hinted he might leave public life to return to his roots.
“What I’m really good at is I’m a really good geography teacher,” Walz said. “I would find the joy in getting back in there.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/P1230796-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-06 21:57:28.481198

Ballot Initiative 4 would revoke all the powers given to “artificial persons,” namely taking aim at corporations, which are granted legal status by the state. Then, the initiative would “regrant” powers, but prohibit corporations from political activities and politicking for ballot issues.
However, in the ruling, written by Justice Jim Rice, the court said that the initiative makes too many changes and doesn’t allow voters to decide on each one separately. The 13-page ruling leans into several challenges brought by groups recently involving constitutional changes and the power of the Attorney General, Austin Knudsen, a Republican.
But the state’s highest court didn’t decide several of the issues the group, Transparent Election Initiative, raised, saying that the one-subject rule was fatal to the initiative, and if supporters of the measure want to present them to voters, they must do it with at least two separate ballot initiatives.
Jeff Mangan, a former Montana Commissioner of Political Practices, has spearheaded the effort to curb the amount of money that flows into the political cycle and Montana elections through the Transparent Election Initiative.
“Montana has a citizens’ initiative process that we can all be proud of, one that allows Montanans to roll up their sleeves to enact positive change for the betterment of family, friends, and neighbors.  I hear from Montanans every day how much corporate and dark money is damaging our political process. It is a privilege to work on a matter that is so important, and that is exactly what we will continue to do,” Mangan told the Daily Montanan on Tuesday. “We appreciate and respect the work of the court. We are grateful for the guidance and understand what the court is saying. We will re-file by the end of this week. Now, I need to get back to work!”
Montana politics in 2024, with a critical U.S. Senate race that saw incumbent Democrat Jon Tester beaten by political newcomer, Tim Sheehy, brought in more than $200 million in a state of around 1.2 million. Just the Tester-Sheehy race alone topped $169 million. 
The court said that while it understood the arguments of the group, its primary concern was protecting the voters of Montana and the constitution.
“The separate-vote requirement was designed to aid voters in casting their votes on constitutional issues, and as a check on the possible action of grouping several issues under one innocuous title,” the opinion said.
The decision explained that the language of the proposed amendment first revoked all powers of existing corporations, then regrants most of them, while prohibiting corporations from exercising political power. Meanwhile, the organization argued that all of those legal maneuvers were part of one overarching plan to change how corporations are treated in Montana.
The court dismissed that argument.
“We agree with the Attorney General that, even if a proposed initiative has an overarching goal, voters must be allowed to vote on each substantive change that is not closely related,” the court said.
The court said that it counted at least two items the proposed ballot initiative changes.
“Here, Transparent Election Initiative designated a target — the power to spend in politics — and casts a much wider net that revokes all powers,” the court said. “In this case, a voter may want to limit artificial persons’ ability to spend money on election or ballot-issue activity, but not limit any other powers that artificial persons may currently exercise in this state.”
Previously, the court has ruled against other initiatives that “log rolled” several issues into one ballot initiative. That is a technique that brings together disparate policies and tries to garner enough support from a wide swath of supporters.
“Although BI-4 does not combine unrelated amendments in an attempt to secure support from different groups, it would force voters who support abolishing corporate spending on elections or ballot issue to support … limit the rights of other entities … and potentially limited the powers of such organizations to engage in activities other than election and ballot issue activities in significant but unspecified other ways.”

The hefty sum falls below what the Trump administration gave to some other states, and the rough average of $200 million to each. But the state is in the middle of the pack when it comes to funding per rural resident. 
The return on Washington’s application for $1 billion over the next five years from the $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program didn’t necessarily come as a shock.
“I don’t think anyone was surprised that we received less than 200,” said Jacqueline Barton True, the Washington State Hospital Association’s vice president of advocacy and rural health. “We certainly internally had operated under the impression that we weren’t going to get $200 million.”
To Elya Prystowsky, the executive director of the Rural Collaborative, the award was a “pleasant surprise.”
“I would have been happy if we got $100 million,” said Prystowsky, whose organization represents Washington’s rural hospitals. “So $181 million is $81 million of gravy, as far as I’m concerned.”
Texas topped the list of funding recipients with $281 million, but the state has over 30 million residents compared to 8 million in Washington. 
Alaska got the next largest share, $272 million, followed by California and Montana, both with about $233 million. 
Democratic-led states tended to fare worse than those run by Republicans. Less rural states also got less money. 
Half of the $50 billion fund will be evenly distributed to all states with approved applications. But assessing how the rest of the money is distributed is complicated because it factors in the number of rural residents and medical facilities in each state, among other things.
Washington, which is less rural than many other states, was in the bottom 10 for funding awarded last week. The state has also had a tense relationship with the Trump administration and is at odds with it on health policy issues.
Here, the hospital association will help dole out infrastructure funding the state receives as part of the federal program. The association’s Barton True expects the state to start spending the money within a couple months.
If the award stays the same over the next five years, Washington would receive about $906 million. But the money states get will be recalculated each year.
Washington aims to use the money for an array of initiatives to not just boost rural hospital finances but reshape the health care system in these communities. 
This includes investing in new technologies, growing the rural health workforce, improving health care in tribal communities, building more community-based care and expanding the rural behavioral health system. Over $300 million was earmarked for hospital infrastructure in the state’s application.
“We could do a lot of good work with $181 million,” Prystowsky said.
It’s unclear what work may be on the chopping block due to the lower-than-requested funding. 
The state Health Care Authority is working to trim its budget plan, but not eliminate any ideas entirely. That revised plan is due to the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services by the end of the month.
“Although our state did not receive the full amount requested, we remain committed to improving the health and wellbeing of people living in rural Washington,” Health Care Authority spokesperson Rachelle Alongi said in an email.
Congress created the new funding stream to help make up for heavy cuts to Medicaid that are expected to disproportionately hurt rural health care providers. Advocates say the $50 billion won’t fill the gap Republicans created last year with their so-called “big, beautiful bill,” which reduced Medicaid spending to help offset the expense of lowering taxes. 
“This funding will not replace the dramatic cuts imposed by the Republican-led Congress and the White House,” Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson said in a statement, “but these funds will help fortify rural communities against what’s to come. It is a significant investment in Washington’s rural health care.”
In Washington’s rural communities, federal spending from Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income Americans, is set to drop over $4 billion in the next decade, according to an analysis by nonpartisan health research group KFF.
The sums from the rural health fund per rural resident varied widely across states, according to a KFF analysis released Tuesday.
Despite relatively modest awards, New Jersey and Rhode Island are getting the most dollars per resident in rural communities, according to KFF.
While big states like California and Texas and some states in the Midwest are getting under $100 per resident. Washington’s award is $162 for each of its 1.1 million rural residents, the KFF data show, landing the state 29th on the list of awards when using that metric.
Zachary Levinson, the lead author of the KFF analysis, noted 10 states are receiving less than $100 per rural resident, while eight states received more than $500.

A demerit for Washington also came from its alignment — or lack thereof — with the Trump administration’s “Make America Healthy Again” policies. These policies include reestablishing the Presidential Fitness Test and restricting how federal food stamp benefits can be spent. 
A Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services spokesperson said the funding amounts were based on a formula that includes a “combination of data-driven factors, merit review of RHT plans, and objective evaluation of state policy actions and commitments to those policies.”
“CMS did not require states to adopt any specific policy to receive funding, and politics played no role in funding decisions,” the spokesperson said Tuesday.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/hospital_beds_720.jpg,,,2026-01-06 20:12:16.866968

Mike Jones is headed back to the General Assembly — this time as a state senator — after winning Tuesday’s special election in Virginia Senate District 15, a Democratic-leaning seat vacated late last year by Ghazala Hashmi.
By 8 p.m., Jones had defeated Republican John Thomas by a margin of 67.8-32% out of 15,409 votes cast, according to unofficial election results, securing a seat that stretches across much of Richmond and parts of Chesterfield County. 
The win caps a fast-moving political reshuffle sparked by November’s statewide elections and ensures Democrats retain control of the district as lawmakers prepare to convene for the 2026 General Assembly session next week.
Jones’ victory immediately triggered another result down-ballot. In House District 77 — the Richmond-based seat Jones vacated to run for the Senate — Democrat Charlie Schmidt won a special election of his own Tuesday, defeating Republican Richard Stonage by 76.5-23.4% out of 5,970 votes cast. Smith will fill the remainder of Jones’ unexpired House term.
The twin victories keep both districts in Democratic hands amid a period of unusual turnover in the legislature, driven largely by lawmakers joining the administration of incoming Gov. Abigail Spanberger, who will be sworn in later next week.
State Sen. Lamont Bagby, D-Henrico, chair of the Democratic Party of Virginia, said Tuesday’s  results underscored Democrats’ momentum heading into the 2026 session.
“I am proud to congratulate Senator-elect Mike Jones and Delegate-elect Charlie Schmidt on their decisive victories,” Bagby said in a statement, calling the races “two more crucial wins for the Democratic Party of Virginia.” 
He said Jones has already demonstrated leadership “with results, integrity, and a deep commitment to the people he serves,” citing his work both in elected office and through his faith. 
Bagby also praised Schmidt as “an accomplished attorney and longtime community advocate” with a record of fighting for civil rights, supporting small businesses and advancing environmental justice. 
“Together,” Bagby said, “these victories send a clear message: when we remain laser-focused on making Virginia more affordable and a place where all can thrive, we can win and will keep winning.”
Tuesday’s contests were set in motion after Hashmi, a Richmond-area senator first elected in 2019, vacated her seat following her election as Virginia’s lieutenant governor. Senate President Pro Tempore Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, in December called Tuesday’s special election to fill the vacancy, compressing campaign timelines and forcing parties to quickly settle on nominees.
Jones, who had represented House District 77 since 2020, entered the Senate race soon after Hashmi’s elevation and emerged from a closely watched Democratic nominating contest last month. That primary exposed some internal party tensions but ultimately solidified Jones as the consensus standard-bearer for Democrats in the district.
Republicans nominated Thomas, who framed the race around public safety and cost-of-living concerns, but the district’s recent voting history and high-profile Democratic turnout efforts proved difficult to overcome.
Jones resigned his House seat shortly after securing the Democratic nomination, prompting a second special election in HD-77 that also landed on Tuesday’s ballot.
Tuesday’s outcomes preserve Democrats’ numbers in both chambers at a critical moment. 
While the party increased its majority in the House following the Nov. 4 elections, several departures — particularly from safe Democratic districts — have required leadership to juggle special elections even as committee assignments and legislative priorities for 2026 are being finalized.
In recent weeks, Democratic leaders have acknowledged that the churn has created logistical challenges but said it has not altered the party’s policy agenda heading into the new session.
Jones is expected to be sworn in quickly, allowing him to participate fully when lawmakers return to Richmond next week. He has built a reputation in the House as a reliable vote for Democratic leadership, with a legislative portfolio that includes criminal justice reform, labor protections and education funding.
Schmidt, the incoming delegate from HD-77 and self-proclaimed progressive Democrat, ran on a platform emphasizing continuity with Jones’ record and local ties to the district. 
The Richmond-area races are part of a broader wave of special elections unfolding across Virginia in the wake of November’s results. Several Democratic lawmakers have stepped down after accepting administration appointments, leaving vacancies that must be filled before or during the early weeks of the 2026 session.
Three additional contests are already on the calendar or expected soon in other parts of the state.
With Tuesday’s results, Democrats enter the 2026 session having successfully defended two key Richmond-area seats, even as the pace of special elections shows little sign of slowing in the weeks ahead.

Dan McKeon of Amherst before the session begins Wednesday.

State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, chair of the Exec Board, sent a letter to McKeon on Monday explaining the findings of the committee’s internal investigation and outlining the processes for an expulsion hearing following its recommendation.
The board recommended expelling McKeon following allegations that he had inappropriately touched a legislative staffer, allegations he denies. But the board also noted what it described as a “demonstrated pattern of behavior.”
The alleged incident with the staffer prompted the Legislature’s investigation and separately led to McKeon being cited for misdemeanor public indecency by the Nebraska State Patrol in September.
The criminal allegation has since been downgraded to a misdemeanor disturbing the peace charge, to which McKeon has pled not guilty after initially attempting to plead no contest but changing his mind.
The incident took place at an end-of-session party this spring, which is typically attended by a mix of lawmakers, staffers, friends and family. In Hansen’s letter he says the staffer claims McKeon jokingly asked her if “she was going to Hawaii to ‘get laid,’” and according to the Patrol, also accused the senator of making “inappropriate contact with her buttocks with his hand, over the top of her clothing.”

Hansen said the Exec Board found that McKeon’s conduct during this incident violates the Nebraska Legislature’s Workplace Harassment Policy, which defines sexual harassment to include “sexually oriented jokes, stories or discussions.”

McKeon has argued there was nothing lewd about this exchange, and claimed the incident has been “exaggerated and mischaracterized.”
“The conduct alleged does not rise to the level of severity attributed to it,” McKeon wrote in response to Hansen’s letter. “I made an ill-advised pun and gave a brief, non-sexual pat on the back as I departed.”
Hansen’s letter gave more details into the alleged “pattern of behavior” the Exec Board noted as a contributor to its recommendation of expulsion. The letter noted separate allegations claimed McKeon made an inappropriate joke in the presence of a female staffer during his first week in office, and said there are more pending complaints alleging McKeon has used “unprofessional language regarding colleagues and individuals of other races.”
McKeon asserted that Hansen’s letter included “material inaccuracies and unsupported characterizations.” He said he has not received any “reports, findings or notice” of the other allegations Hansen’s letter mentioned.
As Nebraska lawmakers consider first expulsion motion, here’s how the process works

Expulsion is the strongest disciplinary measure the board can recommend, and kicking a state senator out of the Legislature requires 33 votes.
Hansen’s letter said the Executive Board has prepared a resolution for McKeon’s expulsion that is ready to be introduced Wednesday, the first day of the 60-day session. The chairman said he intends to schedule a hearing on the resolution Jan. 12, which will include only invited testifiers including McKeon or his lawyer, and outside counsel that conducted the investigation.
McKeon argued his actions do not warrant expulsion, and said removing him would set a dangerous precedent for lawmakers moving forward.
“If disputed allegations, incomplete records, or undisclosed assertions are sufficient to justify expulsion, then no member of this body is secure from removal based on shifting standards rather than established facts,” McKeon wrote.

State Sen. Dan McKeon of Amherst faces possible expulsion after a unanimous recommendation from the Nebraska Legislature’s Executive Board, a panel of legislative leaders that acts as the branch’s human resources department.
The board recommended expelling McKeon following allegations that he had inappropriately touched a legislative staffer. But the board also noted what it described as a “demonstrated pattern of behavior.”

McKeon has made clear he has no plans to resign. On Monday, McKeon’s lawyer Perry Pirsch sent a letter lobbying lawmakers to vote against the expulsion motion, arguing that expelling McKeon risks opening the door for other senators to be expelled with no more than a “contested narrative.”
“Expulsion should not be used as a political shortcut or as a substitute for an election absent extraordinary circumstances,” Pirsch wrote in the letter.
While the Nebraska Legislature has never officially expelled a senator, Clerk of the Legislature Brandon Metzler noted there have been cases where expulsion was considered, but the senator in question resigned or the session ended before the option could be pursued.
“It is unprecedented in the sense of, yes the Legislature has never expelled somebody,” Metzler said. “But I think to say that we’ve never had a situation that rose to this level isn’t quite the same thing.”
As with any disciplinary measure within a legislative session, Metzler said the process starts with a legislative resolution, which can be introduced as soon as the session begins Wednesday.
In a Monday letter to McKeon, State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, the Exec Board chair, said the board has drafted a resolution that is ready to be introduced Wednesday.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Past resolutions typically listed supporting evidence to back up the recommended disciplinary action. In Hansen’s letter, he details some information from the board’s investigation and noted there are separate allegations claiming McKeon made an inappropriate joke in the presence of a female staffer, and joked about people of other races.
Once the resolution is referred to a standing committee — likely the Exec Board — there must be seven days between the notice of a public hearing and the date of the legislative hearing. Hansen said he intends to schedule the hearing Jan. 12, and only include invited testifiers. He said those testifiers can include McKeon or his attorney and outside counsel who conducted the investigation.
If the committee votes to advance the resolution, floor debate can begin immediately, Metzler said. An expulsion motion requires just one round of floor debate and needs 33 votes to remove a sitting senator.
If successful, Metzler said the measure would take effect immediately. McKeon’s seat representing District 41 would become vacant until Gov. Jim Pillen appoints a replacement. Later this year, the state would hold a special election in LD 41 to decide who serves the final two years of McKeon’s term.

The freeze would affect about $10 billion for the Child Care Development Fund, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, and the Social Services Block Grant program. The affected states besides Colorado are Minnesota, New York, California and Illinois, as reported by The New York Times. The states all have Democratic governors.
The freeze was first reported by the New York Post, which cited unnamed officials.

As of Tuesday afternoon, Colorado leadership had not received communication about the potential freeze from the federal government.
“Beyond reports in the media, the state has not been officially notified of any changes to these funding sources,” Shelby Wieman, a spokesperson for Gov. Jared Polis, wrote in an email. “These resources support families in need and help them access food and much more. If true, it would be awful to see the federal government targeting the most needy families and children this way.”
The freeze would affect about $7 billion in TANF funding, $2.4 billion for the CCDF and $870 million for social services grants, according to the Times.










Therefore, I urge my Republican colleagues to leverage their relationships with the administration to end this blatantly political attack against the most vulnerable families in Colorado.


– U.S. Rep. Diana DeGette of Denver


Colorado, which administers its TANF program through Colorado Works, receives about $136 million in block funding for TANF every year, according to Colorado Department of Human Services spokesperson Haysel Hernandez. In 2024, a Colorado family of three received a maximum monthly TANF benefit of $585, according to the National Center for Children in Poverty.
“The federal government has not yet notified CDHS of any changes to these funding sources. These resources support Colorado families in need and help them access job training, financial support, child care and other important social services on the road to self sufficiency,” Hernandez wrote in an email. “Should these funding sources change, we remain committed to supporting our families in Colorado and will continue to advocate for the appropriate programs and services to help our families thrive.”
Colorado was also allocated about $140 million in federal funds for child care programs last year, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. That money pays for care for children in low-income families.
The funding freeze follows a surge of fraud cases in Minnesota involving misuse of government funds for safety-net programs.There have not been comparable fraud charges or allegations in Colorado, but fraud reportedly is a justification for the freeze cited by officials.
“For too long, Democrat-led states and Governors have been complicit in allowing massive amounts of fraud to occur under their watch,” DHHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said in a statement. “Under the Trump Administration, we are ensuring that federal taxpayer dollars are being used for legitimate purposes. We will ensure these states are following the law and protecting hard-earned taxpayer money.”
In a statement, U.S. Rep. Diana DeGette, a Denver Democrat and member of the House Litigation Task Force, said she is “exploring legal action to reverse these unlawful cuts.”
“This devastating freeze will take food from families across the state, in both red and blue areas,” she said. “Therefore, I urge my Republican colleagues to leverage their relationships with the administration to end this blatantly political attack against the most vulnerable families in Colorado.”

After the sudden death of U.S. Rep Doug LaMalfa, a CalMatters reporter who covered him for 20 years reflects on his life and legacy.


If you hadn’t met Doug LaMalfa, his campaign signs probably seemed like the sort of eye-rolling attempt at folksy charm some slick politician who’s never had dirt under his fingernails might use to appeal to rural voters.
“He’s one of us!” they read, a cartoon cowboy hat perched off an “L” in LaMalfa’s name. 
But as I covered LaMalfa’s political career over the past two decades, often critically, I came to appreciate those signs as an accurate description of LaMalfa, the rural North State’s longtime Republican member of Congress. He died in surgery after being rushed to a Butte County hospital Monday for a medical emergency.
LaMalfa was 65. 
Love or hate his hardline, far-right Republican politics – President Donald Trump praised him Tuesday for voting “for me 100% of the time” — LaMalfa was as unique a political figure as you’ll find in Washington, D.C. or in Sacramento. When he said he was “one of us,” it wasn’t an act. LaMalfa, a fourth-generation rice farmer from Butte County, was as engaged with and emblematic of the people in his district as any politician I’ve known.  
You were much more likely to see LaMalfa having a burger and a beer at a watering hole like The Tackle Box in Chico or at the gas station filling up one of his classic cars than you were to see him standing at a lectern in a suit.
From the rice fields of the Sacramento Valley to Modoc County’s border with Oregon, odds were high you’d see LaMalfa’s tall, husky frame as he mingled with his constituents at some Rotary Club luncheon, a county fair, 4-H event, community festival or car show. He was usually wearing faded jeans and scuffed cowboy boots. 
Former Republican gubernatorial candidate and ex-state Sen. Brian Dahle, a farmer from Lassen County, represented much of LaMalfa’s rural district in the Legislature. He said he was in awe of how plugged in LaMalfa was.
“He’s in Modoc. He’s in Plumas. He’s in Siskiyou, He’s in Chico. He’s everywhere and then he’s on a plane five hours back and forth (to Washington, D.C.),” Dahle said. “It was amazing. … I always used to say, ‘You can’t out-backyard barbecue Doug LaMalfa because you’ll go to a backyard barbecue, and he’ll be there.’”
I grew up in LaMalfa’s district and most of my friends and family still live there. They bumped into LaMalfa all the time. I also covered what felt like 100 events featuring LaMalfa as a reporter fresh out of college, first at the Auburn Journal in Placer County and then for six years at the Record Searchlight in Redding in Shasta County. Later, during seven years at The Sacramento Bee, my reporting on environmental issues often took me home to LaMalfa’s district.
My career as a reporter began as LaMalfa was beginning his career in state and federal politics. After graduating from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and working on his family farm, LaMalfa was elected to the Legislature in 2002 first as a Republican member of the Assembly, then as a state senator. 
A politician unlike any other
LaMalfa was elected to Congress in 2012, and held the seat ever since. He planned to try to hold onto it after California voters in November passed Proposition 50, which redrew LaMalfa’s district to skew Democratic. Former California Sen. President Pro Tem Mike McGuire has announced he’s running for LaMalfa’s seat. His death shakes up the political landscape considerably, leaving uncertainty over who will be the Republican challenger in the expected special election to replace him. 
Over the years, I covered LaMalfa, sometimes unflatteringly. At the Searchlight, I wrote about the federal subsidies his family farm received, even as Republicans like him at the time were discussing slashing “welfare” programs for the poor. I wrote about how much money he charged taxpayers for mileage as he zipped around his massive district in one of his gas-guzzling sports cars.
At the Bee, I wrote about how LaMalfa, who as a farmer knew his way around heavy equipment, got into a bulldozer in Sisikiyou County and began mowing down illegal pot farms with the local sheriff’s department.
“I love the smell of diesel power in the afternoon. It smells like victory,” LaMalfa said in a video clip he posted on social media, riffing on the line from the Vietnam War epic, “Apocalypse Now,” before breaking into a grin.
It was a remarkably tone-deaf thing to say since those pot farms were owned by Asian immigrants, some of them Hmong whose relatives fought in the Vietnam War. They were accusing local authorities of race-based harassment. The movie line came right after the military napalmed an innocent Vietnamese village. 
I skewered LaMalfa and his no-compromise style, particularly on environmental issues, in a series of essays I wrote for The Bee about intractable wildlife problems in northeastern California, whose habitats are dear to me. I called him on his cellphone, five years to the day of his death, while the violent mob of Trump’s supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol. He didn’t pick up. LaMalfa would later join the group of Republicans who voted against certifying Joe Biden as president.

All that’s to say, I’m sure plenty of liberal members of LaMalfa’s district aren’t exactly shedding any tears at his loss, but I got choked up Tuesday morning when I read the news he’d died.
I always liked LaMalfa personally, though I don’t think he liked me very much thanks to some of those stories. I guess I just appreciated how Doug LaMalfa never really stopped being Doug LaMalfa, an unpolished farmer who was kind and warm in person, but who also spoke his mind, no matter who was in the room.
I remember seeing him once as I was covering the Kool April Nights car show in Redding. I’m sure he got some face time with the people he hoped would vote for him in the next election, but I could tell he wasn’t really there for that. He was checking out all the shiny old cars because he was a classic car guy and that was his jam. One of LaMalfa’s former staffers said he liked to ask potential hires “What’s your favorite car?”
I’ll also never forget LaMalfa attending an event in Redding at which my wife got an award for her job in a program that helped underprivileged kids. Only a couple of dozen people were there, there were no media cameras, and his office didn’t send out a press release saying he would be there. LaMalfa went because it was just a nice thing to do, quietly supporting those who supported Redding’s troubled youth.
And even though he was a touch frosty with me, he’d always ask how my wife and her dad were during interviews. He regularly ran into my father-in-law in Chico, where he volunteers for various service organizations. 
Republican state Sen. Tony Strickland was LaMalfa’s roommate while the two served in the Legislature. He said “Papa Doug” always took the time, no matter how busy he was, to ask him about his daughter, now in college, who he used to hold as a baby.“He just really is a deeply caring human being,” Strickland said. 
Never afraid to speak his mind
In this era of hyperpartisanship, I respected how, instead of running to cable news to offer a partisan critique, LaMalfa would wait to speak with then-President Biden after his State of the Union addresses. He politely pressed Biden personally to pay more attention to wildfire prevention and other issues important to his constituents. 
I also respected how intensely passionate LaMalfa was about the Oroville Dam spillway disaster in 2017 and the Camp Fire that burned down the town of Paradise the next year. At one point, LaMalfa got on a conference call, hosted by state officials, for the media and began lambasting the people in charge. He was livid. 
Those were his family and friends living below the shattered spillway and whose homes had burned in Paradise.
“You may not agree with his particular viewpoint or his particular stance on an issue,” Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea, who worked closely with LaMalfa during the dam ordeal, the Camp Fire and several other major disasters, told me. “That said, I do believe wholeheartedly, he was passionate about representing the interests of the North State residents that he served, and he did it consistent with his values and what he thought was best for the community.”

Erin Mellon feels the same, despite often being on the receiving end of blistering criticism from LaMalfa when she was spokesperson for the California Department of Water Resources, which manages Oroville Dam. 
Although she is a Democrat, Mellon said even after LaMalfa gave her an earful, she appreciated how kindly he and his team treated her afterwards. At one point, LaMalfa even took her on a personal tour of the spillway in his red Thunderbird convertible.
“In one meeting, he could be reaming you and ripping you, and then the next second, he’s taking you for a tour of Oroville Dam in his prized red convertible sports car,” she said, choking up at the memory. “For him to take that time to respect you as a person is unique. … He was very authentic. He was really himself, and he was really, he was just a great representative of that part of the state. He really fought, I think, for his constituents, and he wasn’t terribly selfish about it.”
LaMalfa is survived by his wife Jill, four children, one grandchild, two sisters and a host of cousins, according to a statement from his office.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/071622-Doug-Lamalfa-Dixie-Fire-GETTY-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-06 19:57:57.325357

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)State Sen. Josh Boschee, D-Fargo, announced Tuesday he is running to become the next mayor of Fargo.
If elected, the former House minority leader said he would resign from the state Legislature.
“It’s a city of 137,000 people and we have a lot of needs, and it needs to have my focus,” Boschee said in an interview. “And the residents of District 44 deserve to have a senator to dedicate their full time to the district.”
Boschee represented Fargo in the North Dakota House of Representatives from 2013 to 2024, serving three sessions as House minority leader. He was elected to the North Dakota Senate in 2024, succeeding Democratic-NPL lawmaker Merrill Piepkorn, who challenged Gov. Kelly Armstrong in the gubernatorial contest. 
Boschee said he thinks it’s time for a new generation of leadership for the state’s largest city, and he believes his relationships with other state lawmakers and the governor’s office will help him continue Fargo’s growth.
“With the seat being open, without an incumbent mayor, it provides an opportunity to really set a new direction for Fargo,” Boschee said.
There is no state law preventing a lawmaker from also serving as mayor or member of a commission, said John Bjornson, director of Legislative Council.
Boschee said serving as mayor of Fargo is a full-time job, and he would not want to disenfranchise residents of Fargo in trying to do both at the same time.
Boschee’s Senate term expires in 2028. If he’s elected mayor, the Democratic-NPL district 44 committee would appoint a new lawmaker to serve the remainder of the term, said Erika White, election director for the Secretary of State’s Office. 
Denise Kolpack, Fargo’s deputy mayor and member of the city commission, launched her mayoral campaign in a social media post Monday. Kolpack and Boschee are the only candidates who have formally announced their candidacy, but others are expected to join the race.
Fargo Mayor Tim Mahoney has served as mayor since 2015 and is ineligible to run for reelection due to term limits.

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)Colorado continues to recommend children receive six vaccinations despite the federal government switching its guidance on them. 
The Trump administration now says the necessity of vaccinations for a raft of diseases and infections should be decided between the doctor and the parent, while previously it recommended universal vaccinations. 
President Donald Trump in December directed the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to review vaccine recommendations from peer nations and recommend any changes to vaccination schedules based on those findings. That review resulted in changed recommendations, announced Monday, for hepatitis A, hepatitis B, rotavirus, meningococcal disease, the flu and COVID-19 vaccines.

The Colorado Board of Health, in accordance with a 2025 state law, updated state vaccine guidance so that it could rely on science-based recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics and other authorities, in addition to the federal government. Legislators passed that law out of fear that the Trump administration would make recommendations for vaccinations that are inconsistent with scientific evidence.
The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment recommends families follow the AAP’s recommended vaccination schedule, which encourages the six shots on which the federal government changed its guidance.
“Colorado’s vaccine guidance is rooted in decades of strong scientific evidence and real-world experience,” Dr. Ned Calonge, chief medical officer at CDPHE, said in a statement. “Regardless of changes at the federal level, our priority is ensuring families and providers have trusted, evidence-based guidance to keep children and communities healthy.”
Health insurance companies will continue to fully cover the six vaccines for children. School vaccine requirements in Colorado also remain the same. 
“Vaccines have an exceptional safety record and remain one of the most effective tools we have to prevent serious disease,” Dr. Rachel Herlihy, deputy chief medical officer at CDPHE, said in a statement. “Colorado will continue to follow expert guidance that reflects the best available science and supports informed decision-making between families and their health care providers, as always.”
Colorado Gov. Jared Polis celebrated the appointment of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has spent decades spreading misinformation and conspiracy theories about vaccines and other health issues. Polis spokesperson Derek Dash said the new changes won’t affect vaccines in Colorado, and Polis “remains committed to ensuring that Coloradans have access to safe, effective vaccines and clear, science-based information so they can make informed decisions about their health.”
“We are protecting access, minimizing confusion, and empowering individuals to choose the protections that are right for them,” Dash said in a statement. 
U.S. Rep. Diana DeGette, a Denver Democrat, said all reputable health care providers say the federal change is dangerous. She said Trump and RFK Jr. are “sabotaging the future of American medicine.” 
“This reckless change in the vaccine schedule by RFK Jr. and his hand-picked team of anti-vaxxers is a direct attack on the health of every American,” DeGette said in a statement. “Without these vaccines, more children will die from preventable illnesses.”

(Photo by McKenzie Romero/Utah News Dispatch)A child in Madison County contracted measles after traveling out of state to an area with an active outbreak, eastern Idaho health officials said Tuesday.
In a news release, Eastern Idaho Public Health officials said they believe the child likely caught measles while traveling, not locally. The child was not vaccinated for measles.
Officials said Madison Health, the Rexburg-based hospital where the child was treated but not hospitalized, has contacted people who were potentially exposed to measles. Eastern Idaho Public Health says it will not publicly announce more cases within the child’s household in a news release. 
Last year, Idaho reported 13 measles cases amid the nation’s worst outbreak in decades. All Idaho measles cases last year were in unvaccinated children, or children whose vaccination status was unknown.
Vaccination is the best way to prevent measles, which is highly contagious and usually leads to hospitalization for one in five children younger than 5 years old who are infected.
Measles is highly contagious but rare. Up to 90% of non-immune people in contact with an infected person can become infected. The virus can live in the air up to two hours after someone infected leaves.
Symptoms typically appear seven to 14 days after exposure and include high fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, and a distinctive rash, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says. While many recover without problems, measles can lead to serious complications, especially in very young children and people with weakened immune systems.
Idaho has a spotty record for measles vaccinations, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
The virus’s serious complications can include pneumonia, encephalitis (an inflammation of the brain) and, in rare cases, death.
People with measles symptoms should not enter health care settings without calling ahead, and they should contact their health care providers. People exposed to measles should monitor for symptoms for 21 days after exposure.
There is no antiviral treatment for measles, according to the CDC.

(Photo  by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was in the Twin Cities Tuesday as the Trump administration launches what it’s calling “the largest DHS operation ever.” 
CBS News reported over the weekend that around 2,000 Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agents are being deployed in Minnesota, in addition to the 700 already present in the state as part of “Operation Metro Surge,” which began in December. 
In a video posted to the Department of Homeland Security’s official X account, Noem and several heavily armed and masked agents arrested a man in St. Paul. In another video, Noem appeared to greet and thank local ICE staff. 
One photo showed Noem meeting with Assistant U.S. Attorney Joe Thompson, who is leading the prosecutions of people accused of defrauding Minnesota’s social services programs. 
The Trump administration’s focus on Minnesota was sparked by unsubstantiated allegations shared by right-wing media figures that Somali Americans who committed fraud were using the proceeds to fund terrorist organizations abroad.
“@POTUS Trump and @Sec_Noem have rallied DHS law enforcement personnel to keep Americans safe and ERADICATE fraud,” DHS posted on X. 
ICE did not respond to the Reformer’s requests for comment. 
Immigrant rights organizations have been fielding many reports of ICE arrests around the metro, but an exact number of arrests is difficult to confirm. Unlike a few high-profile raids in Minneapolis and St. Paul in 2025, which involved dozens of agents and attracted large crowds, ICE appears to be focused on conducting smaller and faster operations.
Walz blasted the deployment as a waste of government resources on social media, sharing a video from a little over a week ago showing dozens of agents leading a single person out of a Hennepin County government building. He said the Trump administration did not give his office advance notice or any additional information on the operation. 
“We have a ridiculous surge of apparently 2,000 people not coordinating with us that are for a show of the cameras,” Walz said at a news conference on Tuesday. “We don’t even know they are, they’ll be wearing masks.”
Noem fired back at the governor for accusing them of misusing taxpayer dollars given the widening scandal of fraud in state-run social service programs that led him to end his campaign for a third term on Monday.
Around the country and in Minnesota, immigration agents have been accused of violating constitutional rights: detaining U.S. citizens for days, targeting individuals based on their speech; and arresting and holding people without probable cause.

In late December, ICE agents entered a private area of the Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis without a judicial warrant, according to immigrant rights activists and Democratic elected officials, who urged Hennepin Healthcare to adopt a clear policy and train employees on how to interact with immigration agents. 
Janna Gewirtz O’Brien, a pediatrician and president-elect of the Minnesota Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said fear of ICE is keeping immigrant families from seeking health care. 
“There is a sense of fear that has been perpetuated by our administration, and we need hospitals to step up,” Gewirtz O’Brien said.

MONTPELIER — A Jewish group that opposes Israel’s military campaign in Gaza has lodged ethics complaints against the five members of the Vermont House who traveled to Israel last September on a trip that was sponsored by the Israeli government.
The Vermont and New Hampshire chapter of Jewish Voice for Peace argued in filings last week that by accepting invitations to go on the trip, the Democratic and Republican legislators ran afoul of state laws limiting what gifts public officials should accept.
The lawmakers are Rep. Sarita Austin, D-Colchester; Rep. Matt Birong, D-Vergennes; Rep. Gina Galfetti, R-Barre Town; Rep. Will Greer, D-Bennington; and Rep. James Gregoire, R-Fairfield. In all, 250 legislators from all 50 states attended the trip, which was described as the largest-ever gathering of U.S. state legislators in Israel.

According to an Instagram post from Israel’s government at the time, the lawmakers “witnessed the magnitude of the October 7 tragedy, experienced Israel’s innovation and cutting-edge technology, tasted our incredible cuisine, and met with Israel’s leaders — including the Prime Minister, the President, the Foreign Minister, and many others.”
At a press conference Tuesday in the Statehouse — the first day of the 2026 legislative session — members of Jewish Voice for Peace, and several other advocacy groups, lambasted the lawmakers’ decision to travel to Israel and demanded they resign.
Officials from the Israeli government valued the trip at $6,500 per person, according to records attached to the ethics complaints that Jewish Voice for Peace filed.
“As elected representatives of Vermont, they implicated our state in Israel’s atrocities,” said Ashley Smith, a member of the Vermont Coalition for Palestinian Liberation, one of the groups at the press conference, speaking to a crowd of dozens of people.
Israel’s ground and air campaign against Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip has killed more than 70,000 people, according to local health authorities. Israeli strikes have destroyed vast swaths of buildings and other infrastructure in the enclave. At the same time, the United Nations has declared a famine there, saying that more than half a million people face “starvation, destitution and death” as a result of Israel’s war. 
An independent U.N. commission determined last year that Israel has committed four “genocidal acts” in Gaza since Oct. 7, 2023. The Hamas attacks on that day that prompted the campaign killed about 1,200 people and led to 250 being taken hostage.
Three other current state legislators were also at the press conference standing among the presenters, including Sen. Tanya Vyhovsky, P/D-Chittenden Central; Rep. Kate Logan, P/D-Burlington; and Rep. Esme Cole, D-Hartford. Vyhovsky called the trip “unconscionable.”
Jewish Voice for Peace is asking Vermont’s State Ethics Commission to recommend that the Vermont House’s internal ethics panel “conduct a thorough investigation” of the group’s complaints. The State Ethics Commission has little authority to take substantive action on ethics complaints when those complaints are related to legislators’ conduct, but the body is generally required to refer such complaints when it receives them.
Christina Sivret, the commission’s executive director, said Tuesday she could not discuss publicly what actions were or were not being taken regarding the complaint.
According to Jewish Voice for Peace, most aspects of the legislators’ trip did not fall into one of the categories of gifts that state law allows public officials to accept. Moreover, the group contended in a press release, the trip amounted to a paid lobbying effort by Israel’s government “with the expectation” that the lawmakers “would support legislation in their home states favorable to Israel’s geopolitical and economic interests.” At the least, the group wrote in its complaints, that created the appearance of a quid pro quo.
The legislators did not file lobbying disclosures with the Vermont Secretary of State’s Office, as is required for some gifts, at the time of the trip. But Vermont legislators aren’t required to disclose gifted trips, anyway, Seven Days reported last year.
The group pointed to how four of the five sponsored a bill last year aimed at creating a new curriculum for Vermont students, and new training for Vermont teachers, focused on “the evolving nature of antisemitism” in the U.S. The legislation, H.310, would also create a new definition of “antisemitic harassment” in Vermont law that includes, among other pieces, “negative references to Jewish customs or the right to self-determination in the Jewish people’s ancestral and indigenous homeland,” which is Israel.
The group also noted how, during a stop in Jerusalem, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar urged the assembled legislators to pass laws in their states that would hinder the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement. That’s the international movement aimed at using economic pressure to force Israel’s government to change its policies.
All five of the legislators pushed back against the advocacy groups’ assertions and calls for resignation in written statements and interviews on Tuesday. 
Birong chairs the House Government Operations and Military Affairs Committee and is the most powerful Vermont legislator who took the trip. 
“In a world increasingly filled with siloed media and narrowed information streams, I wanted to take the opportunity to witness for myself and ask questions,” he said in a statement. “When accepting the invitation, I was under no illusion as to the perspective of our hosts.”
Gregoire is vice chair of the House Corrections and Institutions Committee and pushed back against the assertion that the trip was a lobbying effort by a foreign government. 
“We went during the off session and there was no connection to our legislative work,” Gregoire said in a statement. “No one asked us to do anything beyond standing up against antisemitism and that was during casual conversations.”
Austin said she did not believe she or her colleagues had violated any ethics rules when traveling on the trip. Both Galfetti and Greer said they were eager to move forward with their legislative work for the year, and pointed to how they have been threatened and have feared for their safety since the details of their trip were made public last fall.
Galfetti said in a statement that the complainants and organizers of Tuesday’s press conference “have lied and continued to lie about this trip, pushing an incendiary false narrative designed to spread disinformation in these troubled times.”
In a statement, House Speaker Jill Krowinski, D-Burlington, said her office did not have purview over the legislators’ decision to go on the trip and that “our established, independent review process — the House Ethics Panel” — was where any issues from critics of the trip could be reviewed. The panel’s proceedings are highly secretive, with little information typically available to the public about a given complaint or how it gets resolved.
Meanwhile, Pattie McCoy, the House GOP leader, said in a statement Tuesday that she supported the legislators’ decision to go on the trip. 
“We support State Representatives who reach out and travel to engage in, and build, international relations,” the Poultney Republican said. “Through these efforts Vermont has built business partners that continue to increase our economic presence globally, allowing Vermont businesses to grow and thrive.”

Ohio Senate President Rob McColley has been tapped as GOP frontrunner Vivek Ramaswamy’s running mate in the 2026 governor race, according to their campaign spokesperson.
First reported by NBC News on Tuesday evening, Ramaswamy’s team announced that, if elected, McColley would serve as his lieutenant governor.
McColley, an attorney from Napoleon, Ohio, had long been the expected choice for the Cincinnati-born businessman.
The Senate president, 41, joined Ramaswamy, 40, for many events across the state during the lead-up to this announcement.
Ramaswamy previously told us he will be working with the legislature for all of his policy ideas.
“That’s the type of leadership we need to build upon the foundation that we’ve already set in this state to make us not just the best in the Midwest, but the best in the entire country,” McColley told me in September.
Strategists continued to suggest McColley could be Ramaswamy’s running mate because he can navigate the lawmakers.
Serving as the top leader in the Senate, he controls 23 other Republicans.
McColley was instrumental in getting Ohio’s new flat income tax passed. He also personally pushed back on the House’s more marijuana-friendly legislation on numerous occasions.
Although McColley broke out of lockstep with House Speaker Matt Huffman on several major occasions over the past year, he is the best choice to mediate between the executive branch and legislative, strategists said.
Other than his ability to work with the General Assembly, strategists have told us that McColley can help win over Christian voters.
In December, Ramaswamy wrote a guest essay for the New York Times, condemning racist and Hinduphobic attacks he has faced as he continues to campaign.
McColley’s background
After growing up in Northwest Ohio, he graduated from OSU and went to the University of Toledo for law school.
McColley started in state politics in 2017, first serving in the House and then moving over to the Senate. He has served in leadership positions in each chamber. Before being president, he served as the Senate’s majority floor leader.
He lives in Napoleon with his wife and three kids.

(Photo by Jacob Orledge/North Dakota Monitor)The North Dakota Supreme Court on Tuesday passed the gavel to a female chief justice for the first time in state history. 
Justice Jon Jensen formally stepped down from the role and welcomed Chief Justice Lisa Fair McEvers during a ceremony in front of a packed crowd.
“Women have been eligible to serve on this court since 1920, when women gained the full right to vote, and it took us until now to have a chief justice,” Fair McEvers said during a speech. “While I’m humbled to be the first, I certainly hope that I won’t be the last.”
Fair McEvers earned 83% of the votes cast by sitting justices and district court judges in the December election to determine who would succeed Jensen. Justice Jerod Tufte was the other candidate.

Fair McEvers said the support she has received from across the state and across the country since the election has been overwhelming. 
“I do realize the historical significance of this moment,” Fair McEvers said. “While I’m not a big deal, I’m just a Class B kid from Minto, North Dakota, it’s obvious from the number of people who have contacted me following the ballot opening that this is a big deal to many people that we have selected the first woman in North Dakota to serve in this capacity.”
Fair McEvers has served on the Supreme Court since 2014, when she was appointed by then-Gov. Jack Dalrymple to fill a position vacated by former Justice Mary Muehlen Maring. She was elected to the court to serve a two-year term in 2016 and a 10-year term in 2018.
Susan Bailey, a district court judge and a friend of Fair McEvers since they attended law school together, said she made calm confidence her hallmark. 
“In every role, the same core values shine through. Fairness, humility and an unwavering respect for the rule of law,” Bailey said during the ceremony.
Jensen, who did not seek reelection to the post of chief justice, will continue to serve as one of the Supreme Court’s five justices. 
Fair McEvers said she hopes to build on many initiatives begun by Jensen. 
“I intend to be a chief who listens, is patient and values the ideas of others, even when I might not agree with them,” Fair McEvers said.

(Photo by Audrey Carleton/Capital and Main)The Pennsylvania Supreme Court on Tuesday ended appeals of a lower court’s ruling that the commonwealth’s participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative was illegal. 
The court’s order dismissing the cases as moot follows Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro’s agreement to withdraw from the multi-state climate compact as part of his deal with Republican state lawmakers to bring the five-month budget stalemate to a close in November.
It also came more than six months after the  state’s highest court heard oral arguments in the cases in May.
While many who opposed the program said it would drive up energy costs and constitute a drag on the economy, environmentalists argued a well-designed carbon cap program would reduce climate warming emissions while generating billions of dollars for the commonwealth. 
The initiative, which is ongoing in 11 states, requires major carbon dioxide emitters, such as fossil fuel-fired power plants, to purchase carbon credits in an auction. Money from the credits is invested in sustainable energy projects in the states.
Challengers argued Pennsylvania’s membership in the program violated the state constitution. 
They claimed Gov. Tom Wolf overstepped his executive authority by entering into the agreement without approval from the General Assembly and the cost of carbon credits constituted an illegal tax.
Siding with challengers, the Commonwealth Court ruled in November 2023 that to pass constitutional muster, Pennsylvania’s participation in RGGI “may only be achieved through legislation duly enacted by the Pennsylvania General Assembly.” 
In a series of eight orders, the Supreme Court dismissed appeals by Constellation Energy, Citizens for Pennsylvania’s Future, Clean Air Council, the Sierra Club. It also dismissed appeals by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection and the Environmental Quality Board, which issued the regulations establishing RGGI in the commonwealth.
The commonwealth entered the compact during Wolf’s administration in April 2022 when the final regulation was published in the Pennsylvania Bulletin as required by state law. 
Pennsylvania joined neighboring states New York, New Jersey, Maryland, and Delaware in RGGI more than three years after the regulatory process first began and after considerable bipartisan pushback from opponents who said Wolf’s decision to join the multi-state agreement was an example of executive overreach.
In arguments before the seven-member Supreme Court last spring, environmental groups argued the state constitution guarantees the protection of public resources including clean air and that the DEP’s plan to limit carbon emissions is constitutional because it is part of its program to protect the public’s environmental rights.
“Air is a public trust resource, and the department and other trustees have to act to protect it,” Jessica O’Neil, who represented Penn Future, the Sierra Club, the Clean Air Council and the Environmental Defense Fund, said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/homer-city-power-plant-capital-and-main-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-06 18:58:57.982142

Vermont confronts each cost crisis separately, even as they amplify one another and squeeze budgets year after year. What Vermont needs now is a change in mindset.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Benjamin Brickner: Vermont’s cost crises are connected. Our solutions should be, too..","This commentary is by Benjamin Brickner, of Pomfret. He is a practicing attorney and chair of the Pomfret Selectboard.



As towns and school districts across Vermont finalize their budgets, local officials are staring down a familiar question: with healthcare, housing, personnel and other non-discretionary costs out of control, what gets cut?
For Pomfret and its 916 residents, hard choices are inevitable. Road maintenance may be scaled back. Overworked staff may go without needed support. Taxes still rise. Important services take the hit — and with them, the quality of life that defines our community.
After several years in local office, here’s what troubles me: Vermont confronts each cost crisis separately, even as they amplify one another and squeeze budgets year after year.
Consider healthcare costs and their far-reaching effects on seemingly unrelated but personnel-intensive areas like road maintenance, municipal administration and education. Recent efforts to institute drug price caps (Act 55) and reference-based pricing (Act 68) are helpful, but they don’t address actuarial realities in a small state with an aging population.
Education reform faces similar headwinds. Act 73 focuses largely on consolidation. That may reduce the number of school districts, but it won’t solve what motivated reform in the first place. Even consolidated districts remain vulnerable to rising costs like health insurance, which is projected to soon consume one-fifth of school budgets.
Housing costs compound these pressures. Act 181’s recent changes to Act 250, Vermont’s Land Use Law, have altered the regulatory landscape, but they don’t address the labor and material costs that put housing out of reach for many young families, including children of lifelong Vermonters.
The result is familiar: towns with stagnating grand lists, schools with falling enrollment and residents squeezed as essential costs spiral.
The question isn’t whether Vermont should tackle these issues. We must. The real question is whether we’ll approach them as a single, interconnected challenge or continue patching leaks while the foundation shifts. Acts 55, 68, 73 and 181 are sensible in isolation. Collectively, they miss the mark.
What Vermont needs now isn’t more task forces, commissions or disconnected legislation. We’ve tried that, with mixed results. We need a change in mindset.
As lawmakers reconvene in Montpelier, we must think in systems, not silos. Health insurance premiums shape school budgets. Housing affordability shapes demographics. Each policy sends ripples far beyond its intended target. These connections aren’t always obvious, which makes on-the-ground listening essential.
Local officials are often the first to see the cascading effects of well-meaning reform: road crews short-staffed because housing costs outpace wages; school districts unable to hire because health insurance is prohibitive; towns cutting office hours to keep municipal taxes down as education taxes rise. When laws are written without input from those living these impacts, unintended consequences are inevitable.
Vermont can no longer afford that cycle.
Lawmakers should break the silos by consulting with towns and schools before drafting legislation. Ask what pressures they face, what would change if healthcare or housing costs stabilized, and what would help stretch limited dollars.
Voters should connect the dots. You don’t need budgetary expertise to see the patterns. Learn what towns control and what they don’t — and tell your representatives what you see. Informed feedback from constituents is as valuable as any expert report.
Local officials should document the realities. Towns and schools can help lawmakers see the system by presenting data showing how costs rise, what gets cut and who is affected. This gives lawmakers the information they need to craft reforms that stand a chance of working.
Vermont can address education costs, healthcare affordability and housing shortages. We have the tools and the talent. What we need is a clearer understanding of how these problems connect.
In Pomfret, we don’t have the luxury of tackling one problem at a time. We manage interdependent issues by understanding their connections and responding accordingly. Vermont must do the same.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-06 23:40:55+00:00,CT Mirror,CT assures continued insurance coverage for childhood vaccines,Katy Golvala,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/06/ct-assures-continued-insurance-coverage-for-childhood-vaccines/,Childhood vaccines will remain covered by insurance despite recent recommendation changes by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.,"Childhood vaccines will remain covered by insurance plans despite recent recommendation changes issued by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, interim state insurance commissioner Josh Hershman confirmed in a statement Tuesday evening.
“Parents should be clear on this point: childhood vaccines remain covered by insurance in Connecticut, and nothing about the CDC’s recent announcement changes insurance coverage requirements for childhood vaccinations,” Hershman stated. “Families should continue to obtain vaccinations in consultation with their health care providers.”
On Monday, the CDC announced updates to its recommendations for childhood vaccines, which came after conducting an analysis of “how peer, developed nations structure their childhood vaccination schedules” at the request of President Donald Trump. The review found that the United States “recommended more childhood vaccine doses than any peer nation” and that “countries without vaccine mandates had as high immunization rates as the U.S.”
In response, the CDC issued a new, tiered recommendation, grouping childhood vaccines into three buckets: shots recommended for all children, those recommended for certain high-risk groups and those where decisions should be left up to “shared clinical decision-making,” or conversations between people and their doctors. 
As of the end of 2024, the vaccine schedule recommended 17 immunizations for all children. The updated schedule broadly recommends just 11, including polio, whooping cough, measles, mumps, rubella and chicken pox. Among the vaccines the CDC no longer recommends for all children are flu, hepatitis A and hepatitis B.
In a fact sheet published on Monday, the federal government clarified that, despite the recommendation changes, all vaccines would continue to be available to anyone who wants them through ACA plans, Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program and the Vaccines for Children program. 
“Families will not have to purchase them out of pocket. Among peer nations, the U.S. will continue to offer the most childhood vaccines for free to those who want them,” stated the fact sheet.
Hershman reiterated this message to Connecticut residents on Tuesday evening. 
“The vaccines referenced in the CDC announcement were not removed from the immunization schedule. Instead, they were moved from a routine recommendation to clinical decision-making recommendation,” Hershman stated. “Because these vaccines remain on the CDC schedule, they continue to be covered by health insurance plans regulated by the CID.”
Department of Public Health Commissioner Manisha Juthani “is solely responsible” for determining Connecticut’s vaccine schedule, and the state’s recommendations for childhood vaccines will remain unchanged, a DPH spokesperson confirmed. 
In a statement issued on Tuesday, Juthani said she had “serious concerns” about the CDC’s changes and said the move “risks creating confusion, placing more burden on parents and clinicians, and making preventive care harder to navigate.”
Juthani also addressed the federal government’s analysis comparing the U.S. vaccination schedule to peer nations.
“Other countries’ vaccine schedules reflect their own health systems and disease patterns, and a one-size-fits-another-country approach does not reflect the realities facing children in the United States,” Juthani stated.
Lawmakers have already started to discuss how Connecticut can address the uncertainty surrounding federal vaccine policy during the upcoming legislative session.
“Yesterday’s news was not surprising but absolutely shocking,” Public Health Committee co-chair Cristin McCarthy Vahey, D-Fairfield, said. “We will likely want to decouple ourselves from that federal guidance.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP24248694401334-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-06 18:58:57.982142

Inside the Capitol, U.S. House Democrats gathered in a small meeting room, apparently unable to secure larger accommodations for an unofficial hearing that largely rehashed the findings of a House committee that spent 2022 investigating the attack.Trump, meanwhile, addressed House Republicans three miles west at the Kennedy Center. In an hour-plus address, he blamed then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for the violence on Jan. 6, 2021 and recommended the GOP lawmakers pass laws to make election fraud more difficult. Trump’s claim that his 2020 election loss was due to fraud sparked the 2021 attack.“Our elections are crooked as hell,” he said, without citing evidence.House Dems blast pardons Inside the Capitol, at a morning event that U.S. House Democrats organized and in which Republicans didn’t take part, lawmakers and experts criticized Trump’s pardons of people involved in the 2021 attack, one of his first acts after returning to office last year.They also decried his continued recasting of the events of the day.White House officials launched a webpage Tuesday that blamed the attack on Democrats, again including Pelosi, and restated the lie that initiated the attack: The 2020 election that Trump lost was marred by fraud and should not have been certified.“Democrats masterfully reversed reality after January 6,” the page reads. “...In truth, it was the Democrats who staged the real insurrection by certifying a fraud-ridden election, ignoring widespread irregularities, and weaponizing federal agencies to hunt down dissenters.” Pelosi at the hearing on Tuesday condemned Trump’s version of the attack. “Today, that president who incited that insurrection continues to lie about what happened that day,” the California Democrat said.

Other Democrats and their invited witnesses also described the pardons as signaling that the president accepted — and even encouraged — his supporters to pursue illegal means of keeping him in power. Brendan Ballou, a former U.S. Justice Department prosecutor who resigned shortly after Trump’s 2025 pardons, told the panel the executive action sent Trump supporters the “clear message” they were above the law.“The January 6 pardons also fit into a broader narrative of what’s going on with this administration, that if people are sufficiently loyal and willing to support the president, either in words or financially, they will be put beyond the reach of the law,” he added. “It means that quite literally for a certain group of people right now in America, the law does not apply to them.”Former ‘MAGA granny’ testifiesHomeland Security Committee ranking Democrat Bennie Thompson of Mississippi led the panel discussion, with Judiciary Committee ranking member Jamie Raskin of Maryland and several others also sitting in on it.The first panel of witnesses included Ballou, other experts and Pamela Hemphill, a former Trump supporter from Idaho who traveled to the nation’s capital five years ago to “be part of the mob” in support of the president before becoming an advocate for reckoning with the day’s violence.An emotional Hemphill, 72 and once known as “MAGA granny,” apologized to U.S. Capitol police officers.

“Once I got away from the MAGA cult and started educating myself about January the 6th, I knew what I did was wrong,” Hemphill told the panel. “I pleaded guilty to my crimes because I did the crime. I received due process and the DOJ was not weaponized against me. “Accepting that pardon would be lying about what happened on January the 6th,” she added.She explained her decision to decline Trump’s blanket pardon of offenders convicted of crimes related to the attack, saying it papered over the misdeeds of people involved in the riot. She implored others not to accept revisions of the narrative about what happened in the attack.Subsequent panels included current and former House members, including two, Republican Adam Kitzinger of Illinois and Democrat Elaine Luria of Virginia, who sat on the committee tasked with investigating the attack.Flowers for Ashli BabbittThe crowd of marchers, which included pardoned Jan. 6 attack participants, gathered in the late morning to retrace their path to the U.S. Capitol five years ago.Organizers billed the march as a memorial event to honor Ashli Babbitt, who was killed by U.S. Capitol Police during the riot in 2021 as she attempted to break into the House Speaker’s lobby.Far-right activists celebrating the five-year anniversary of the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol marched in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, Jan. 6, 2026, from the Ellipse to the Capitol.

(Video by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)The crowd of roughly a couple hundred walked from the Ellipse, where Trump spoke to rallygoers in 2021, to just outside the Capitol grounds, where police contained the small crowd on the lawn north of the Reflecting Pool. Law enforcement officers permitted Babbitt’s mother, Michelle Witthoeft, and a few others to walk closer to the Capitol to lay flowers at roughly 2:44 p.m. Eastern, the time they say Babbitt died.A group of counterprotesters briefly approached the demonstration, yelling “traitors.” Police quickly formed two lines between the groups, heading off any clashes.Proud Boys former leader on-site Among the crowd was former Proud Boys national leader Enrique Tarrio, who was sentenced to 22 years in federal prison for seditious conspiracy and other charges related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack. Trump commuted Tarrio’s sentence upon taking office for his second term.While looking on at marchers, Tarrio told States Newsroom he was “just supporting.”“It’s not my event. I’m just trying to help them with organizing and marching people down the street, I guess. But we're here for one purpose, and that's to honor the lives of Ashli Babbitt and those who passed away that day.”

When asked if marchers were also honoring the police officers who died in the days and months after the attack, Tarrio said he mourned “any loss of life” but added “I heard some suicides happened. I don't know. I haven't really looked into that. I've been in prison.”U.S. Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick suffered injuries during the riot, according to the Capitol Police. He died the following day from natural causes, according to the District of Columbia Office of the Medical Examiner.Four responding police officers died by suicide in the following days and months.As the march continued, a group of Capitol Police and Metropolitan Police officers on bicycles stopped Tarrio and asked him to confirm the march route to avoid any “confusion.”When counterprotesters began to heckle the Jan. 6 attack supporters, Tarrio waved the marchers forward, “C’mon, c’mon, keep moving.”

Connors said he didn’t enter the Capitol during the 2021 attack, but said he was in the district that day to protest the 2020 presidential election, which he falsely claimed was “robbed” from Trump.“Donald Trump, I'll take the bullet for that man.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Massachusetts late Tuesday afternoon released transcripts from videos attributed to the suspect in the Dec. 13 mass shooting at Brown University and the Dec. 15 homicide of MIT professor Nuno Lunoeiro in Brookline, Massachusetts.
The set of four transcripts were translated into English from Portuguese, U.S. Attorney Leah Foley’s office said in a news release. The investigation between federal and local law enforcement remains ongoing, but Foley’s office said investigators were ready to share one cache of findings from a federal search warrant for the New Hampshire storage facility where Claudio Manuel Neves Valente had rented a unit and was found dead on Dec. 18 by investigators. 
“Neves Valente showed no remorse during the recordings; on the contrary, he exposed his true nature when he blamed innocent, unarmed children for their deaths at his hand and grumbled about a self-inflicted injury he suffered when he shot the MIT professor at close range,” Foley’s office stated. “Our investigation into the motives behind Neves Valente’s heinous acts will continue.” 
Neves Valente claimed to have the storage unit for three years and he imagined he had enough money to last “a few more good years, if it was in Portugal or a cheaper place.” The transcripts suggest Neves Valente had possibly been planning the shooting for six semesters.   
The FBI found “an electronic device containing a series of short videos made by Neves Valente after the shootings,” according to Foley’s office. The videos are timestamped Dec. 16, the same day investigators and an autopsy have confirmed is the day Neves Valente killed himself at the storage facility in Salem.

Neves Valente is a Portuguese national who had attended Brown as a young adult in the early 2000s before dropping out.
In the first video, which is cited as the longest at around six and a half minutes, Neves Valente says his eye was injured during the close-range shooting of Lunoeiro, his former colleague who attended the same physics program at a Portuguese university. 
Neves Valente noted that he was not “extraordinarily satisfied” with the shootings, nor was he regretful. 
He also commented on media coverage and social media chatter about the shootings, especially speculation on what he had yelled upon entering the classroom in Brown’s Barus & Holley building.  
“It seems like someone over there said that I was saying that I was… Allah Akbar or some s— like that,” the transcript reads. “I do not remember having said anything. If I did say something, it must have been some kind of an — an exclamation.”
The transcript ends with Neves Valente ridiculing the Brown students for not leaving the classroom when he opened fire.  
Foley’s office added that while Brown University was Neves Valente’s intended target, “he did not provide a motive for targeting students at Brown University or the professor at MIT.”

While it may seem like this information is simply lost in the ether, it is actually stored in data centers, which have been popping up across the United States. And we are now starting to see them in our own backyards. Data centers are being proposed in places such as Sioux Falls, Toronto (Deuel County), and even at the gate of the sacred Black Hills, in Rapid City’s new industrial complex.
AI developers state that they are targeting colder climate areas to reduce the amount of energy needed to operate these data centers. Addressing the energy needs, employment promises and overall environmental impact of data centers will allow South Dakotans to decide whether we really want this infrastructure to be developed in our state. We live here, and our voices matter.
Politicians and data center developers are downplaying the massive energy requirements that the proposed data centers will demand. Approximately 400 megawatts of power from our electric grids could be needed for one data center, consuming half of the energy that South Dakota has spent over 75 years sizing up to sustain the expanding population and economic growth we are seeing today.
Congressman speaks in support of data centers in SD, calling anti-development rhetoric ‘un-American’

These massive data centers are filled with computers to store AI and cryptocurrency data, and computers generate a lot of heat. To avoid overheating and ensure proper functioning, large amounts of water are needed to cool the systems down. Some data center developers claim that water usage for the proposed data centers here will be no more than that of the average U.S. household. However, our cold season does come to an end, and as temperatures continue to rise and display record summer highs year after year, these claims will become less valid. There is already a strain on our water resources here in South Dakota, so potential water shortages could result if the issue is aggravated.
Furthermore, claims that the demand on our energy grid will not increase our already rising energy bills are sugarcoated at best. Americans have seen about a 13% national increase in electricity prices since the beginning of 2025, and this trend is expected to continue.
Transparency is a must when it comes to grandiose promises, such as the statements that data centers will create substantial job growth for South Dakotans. While the construction of these large buildings will bring temporary employment, once construction ends, so will most of these jobs. Also, the construction of a data center requires highly skilled workers. We can’t be sure that out-of-state companies won’t be brought in for the construction.
On average, an operating data center needs between 30 and 100 full-time employees. There is currently no data to show how the hundreds of jobs promised compare to the jobs that are actually created, or what kind of jobs those even are.
Data centers also bring a slew of environmental problems in their wake. As stated previously, they will consume a large amount of water. We’re talking hundreds of thousands to millions of gallons of water per day for an evaporative-cooled system in the data center. On the low end, this water usage is equivalent to the needs of a city the size of Pierre. On the high end of consumption, it would be more comparable to the water needs of Sioux Falls. There is technology that operates on a closed-loop system where the water is cooled and recycled. However, this could increase the electricity demand by more than 20% and further burden our fragile energy grid, contributing to ratepayers’ increased energy costs.
The message is clear — communities need to have transparency around proposed data centers so they can weigh the economic and environmental impacts in order to protect hardworking South Dakotans and our beautiful lands. These impacts must be weighed against proposals to bestow tax rebates on the billion-dollar companies building these data centers (Google, Meta, Amazon).
More factual information regarding the jobs promised, the electrical and water usage, and environmental risks needs to be brought forward and discussed before any construction begins. Finding ways to mitigate the environmental and economic effects that are correlated with data centers should be a top priority for South Dakotans as we take a stand to protect our communities.

(Pool photo by Trent Nelson/The Salt Lake Tribune) Prosecutors and defense attorneys both agree the armed protest volunteer accused of shooting and killing an innocent bystander in Salt Lake City in June was trying to neutralize what he thought was a threat. They disagree on whether what he did was a crime. 
The case got underway Tuesday as Matthew Scott Alder, 43, appeared in court for the first time to answer a charge of manslaughter, more than seven months after the shooting.  
Prosecutors say he was aiming at a man carrying a rifle when he mistakenly shot Arthur “Afa” Ah Loo at the No Kings protest on June 14. They allege Alder committed a crime with one “reckless” shot that hit Ah Loo, of three total. 
Alder, wearing a gray suit, stood quietly in court Tuesday during the brief hearing, lasting less than three minutes. He did not respond to a request for comment from Utah News Dispatch as he left the courthouse.

His defense attorney Philp Wormdahl told reporters that Alder did not break any law and has a strong self-defense claim. Wormdahl said his legal team plans to make use of a 2021 Utah self-defense law requiring judges to dismiss certain cases early on if prosecutors can’t prove by “clear and convincing evidence” that the use of force was unjustified.
“Obviously, on that date in June, it was a great tragedy,” Wormdahl said. “But given the evidence that I’m aware of now, the lawyers who are involved in this are all uber-confident that no reasonable person could find that he wasn’t justified in his actions.”
Wormdahl noted charging documents quote a witness who told police she “was concerned for the lives of everyone around me” based on the actions of the man with the rifle.

On Tuesday, a 3rd District Court commissioner ordered Alder to have his fingerprints and photograph taken at the Salt Lake County Jail. The commissioner scheduled a court date in March before wishing Alder luck. 
Alder has not been jailed in the case. Prosecutors said last month he is not a flight risk and requested a court summons instead. 
In June, Alder told investigators he saw someone “charging the handle” of a rifle, making it ready to fire, and moving toward the crowd. Alder yelled for the man to stop to no avail, charging documents say, and thought the man wielding the gun was going to “mag dump into a crowd of people.” He told police that what he saw “scared the hell out of me.” 
In announcing the charge against Alder in December, Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill drew distinctions between the first two shots that wounded Arturo Gamboa in the abdomen and hit his gun, and a third that had a different backdrop “within a large gathering with so many different people,” including Ah Loo. 
Gill cleared Gamboa, who was originally jailed for six days as Salt Lake City police said they were investigating him for murder. Gamboa has said his weapon was unloaded and he was exercising his First and Second Amendment rights that day.

While his actions of assembling an AR-15 under cover during a mass gathering were “alarming and irresponsible,” he didn’t commit any crime, Gill said, noting Utah law allows people to openly carry rifles at protests. 
Rep. Verona Mauga, D-Salt Lake City, said last month she’s working on a proposal to change that. If Utah were to prohibit firearms from demonstrations, it would join North Carolina and Alabama. Under Texas law, displaying a “firearm or other deadly weapon in a public place in a manner calculated to alarm” fits a misdemeanor offense of disorderly conduct. 
The June event drew an estimated 10,000 demonstrators voicing their opposition to President Donald Trump’s policies. 
Ah Loo, a celebrated fashion designer and father of two from Clearfield, was taking video of fellow protesters when he was killed. His widow, Laura Ah Loo, said in December that the months she waited for answers after his death were “long, painful and deeply frustrating.”

Her attorneys have said she plans to sue Alder and is gathering more information about what led up to the shooting. 
Gov. Spencer Cox said in June that the Department of Public Safety had warned Utah 50501
organizers ahead of their protest that arming people was a “bad idea.” The group said in response the governor was “grossly misinformed.” 
The state then released copies of correspondence with organizers that said “a ‘private security team’ is not allowed at the Utah State Capitol.” Whoever applied for the Salt Lake City protest event permit used an alias and got approval anyway, the city acknowledged in August, prompting it to strengthen its requirements. 
If convicted, Alder faces 1 to 15 years in prison and up to a $10,000 fine. He returns to court March 20 for a scheduling hearing.

Kansas Fire Marshal Mark Engholm said the motors were destroyed because of all the debris hidden in the water that rose during deadly summer flash floods, causing more than $1 billion in damage.
Kansas was one of a handful of states that aided Texas agencies in recovery and rescue.
“They went through their local resources fairly quickly,” Engholm said. “Within 48 hours, they were asking other states for help.”
The effort cost the state at least $370,000. The State Finance Council, made up of the governor and legislative leadership, on Tuesday unanimously approved the funds be reimbursed. Initial estimates placed costs at $265,000.
Local firefighters from Kansas City, Kansas; Manhattan; and elsewhere in the state sent water rescue teams to Texas. 
They worked for 14 days, focusing on recovery efforts while “working through some very, very difficult situations,” Engholmsaid.

Happy first day back to school session! How was your summer? The floors are a little cleaner and the eyes are a little brighter as the both the Senate and the House of Representatives begin their second year of the biennium. 
The House gaveled back into session Tuesday morning after some seemingly requisite first-day-back technological hiccups and all-but-obligatory mentions of creemees and Carhartt, lest lawmakers forget they’re in Vermont.
As if compelled by some invisible force, the conversations in the halls and on the chamber floors all seemed to drift toward addressing the unfinished business of last year’s big education bill.

“If last year asked a lot of us, this year will ask even more,” House Speaker Jill Krowinski, D-Burlington, told her colleagues, nodding to some of the challenges on education, housing and health care. 
So, as lawmakers go back to the books to figure out how to organize the state’s schools, I decided to talk to the building’s school-aged visitors about how it feels on the first day of session.
Winnie Liu is an eighth-grader from Montpelier who was mere hours into her first day as a legislative page when we spoke: “It’s not as busy as I expected at first, but it’s going really smoothly and all the directions are clear,” she said of day one. We will have to see how she feels come May.
For Liliana Klimanska, a high school exchange student visiting Vermont, “it’s a really nice opportunity to see, not from the TV or from the news, but from inside, how people behave, how people interact with each other and how they create this whole community. You can actually see that they’re casual with each other, they connect, and they appreciate each other’s efforts to make Vermont better. It’s really cool.” 
That picture of a body going back to school was clear for Klimanska’s peer, Amelie Richter, a German exchange student: “Even before it started, you could see all of the House people just talking with each other, like us coming back after a holiday break.”

On the move
The House and Senate sent more than 100 bills to committee on Tuesday. Stay tuned as we track the key pieces of legislation.
Rather than attempt to override Gov. Phil Scott’s veto of last year’s attempted overhaul of Vermont’s motel housing program, Speaker Jill Krowinski sent the bill, H.91, back to committee.

On Monday, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scaled back federal vaccine guidelines for children, removing six vaccines from a “recommended” status. The House Committee on Human Services hit the ground running, reviewing the newly introduced H.545, which would reissue state-level vaccine recommendations and bolster Vermont’s ability to provide immunizations to those who want them.

In a moment of flipping the focus, so to speak, Rep. Doug Bishop, D-Colchester, recognized VTDigger’s own staff photographer Glenn Russell for the start of his 40th year covering the Vermont Legislature. “He has helped bring his keen eye and enormous skill to the stories published by the publications he’s worked with. He’s helped deliver the human side of those stories,” Bishop said. We couldn’t agree more.

Governor calls for a rehearing and urges lawmakers to draft a constitutional amendment to let Wyoming voters settle the matter. 
The post Abortion-rights advocates cheer Wyoming Supreme Court ruling; opponents plan constitutional amendment appeared first on WyoFile .","As a plaintiff in the 2022 lawsuit that kicked off years of legal sparring over Wyoming abortion rights, Dr. Giovannina Anthony had waited a long time for Tuesday’s Supreme Court decision on the state’s abortion bans.
“It has been a long road,” she said. One with ups and downs, drawbacks and delays. And even though the high court ruled against the state’s abortion bans, she’s not under the illusion that the fight for abortion access is over. 
“But at least today, we can claim a victory and say, it was really worth it,” said Anthony, a Jackson obstetrician. “It was worth it to go four years and keep it up and keep raising money and keep the awareness going. I’m really proud of our team. I’m really proud of what we accomplished.”
In reading the Supreme Court’s decision siding with plaintiffs, Anthony said, “Clearly, this is a court that holds a lot of respect for our constitution.” 
That’s because much of the decision hinged on constitutional language. 
Anthony and other plaintiffs argued that abortion is enshrined in the “right of health care access” in Article 1, Section 38 of the Wyoming Constitution. The clause states, “Each competent adult shall have the right to make his or her own health care decisions.”
The state’s attorneys, meanwhile, countered that abortion isn’t health care. 
But in deciding what that language means in this case, “all five Wyoming Supreme Court justices agreed that the decision whether to terminate or continue a pregnancy is a woman’s own health care decision protected by Article 1, Section 38,” the court’s summary stated.
As abortion rights activists in Wyoming and beyond celebrated the decision, the anti-abortion camp decried it and called for legislative action. 
“This ruling is profoundly unfortunate and sadly serves to only prolong the ultimate proper resolution of this issue,” Gov. Mark Gordon said in a statement. While the ruling may settle a legal question for the time being, Gordon said, “it does not settle the moral one, nor does it reflect where many Wyoming citizens stand, including myself.”

Gordon asked the Attorney General’s office to file a petition for rehearing the decision, which it will file within 15 days.
The voters of Wyoming should settle the matter once and for all, Gordon argued. “A constitutional amendment taken to the people of Wyoming would trump any and all judicial decisions.”
He called on the Legislature to pass such an amendment during the upcoming session and deliver it to his desk. A constitutional amendment requires a two-thirds vote in both the House and Senate to appear on the ballot in the following general election. 
Gordon may get his wish during the Legislature’s 2026 budget session, which convenes Feb. 9.
State lawmakers are already preparing a bill to modify the Wyoming Constitution and clear a path for another attempted abortion ban. Speaker of the House Chip Neiman, a Republican from Hulett, said that he’s been workshopping language with Torrington Republican Sen. Cheri Steinmetz. 
“I’ve got to run it by a lot of other people,” Neiman said.

Ideally, he added, a single constitutional amendment would be considered, although the legislative strategy is still up for discussion. 
“We’ve got a little over a month before we have to be in session,” Neiman said. “That’ll give us time to kind of see which is maybe the best plan of action.” 
A constitutional amendment would have to navigate the legislative process in a 20-day session geared toward passing Wyoming’s budget. Then, in the 2026 general election, more than half of Wyoming voters who cast a ballot would have to agree to the constitutional change.
Neiman struck an optimistic tone about an amendment’s prospects of passing the first hurdle during the session in Cheyenne.
“I can’t speak for the other chamber,” he said, “but in my chamber I’ve got a lot of phone calls and a lot of texts from a lot of my legislators who are just beside themselves at what happened.”
Senate President Bo Biteman did not return a phone call before this story published.
Victorious 
Chelsea’s Fund, an organization that helps pay for abortion services, was another of the plaintiffs that challenged Wyoming’s abortion bans. Executive Director Janean Forsyth said Tuesday’s decision affirms what her organization has long known: “that abortion is essential health care, and Wyoming women have a constitutional right and the freedom to make their own health care decisions, and that should be without government interference.”
Forsyth was flooded with messages and calls Tuesday, she said, especially from the community of reproductive rights organizations. 
“I think that [the news is] a beacon of hope for, not only Wyoming communities and families, but also nationwide,” she said. 
Christine Lichtenfels was Chelsea’s Fund executive director when the original suit was filed and throughout much of the legal battle. Relief wasn’t quite the word to describe how she felt Tuesday, she said. 
“In reading the decision, there is just a sense that, ‘Oh, there is reason in the world,” she said. “It makes me think that, yes, Wyoming is the Equality State. We can say that now without cringing.” 
(Disclosure: Lichtenfels is currently working with WyoFile on an unrelated legal matter.)

Wyoming’s only abortion clinic, Wellspring Health Access in Casper, was also a plaintiff in the lawsuit. Knowing the decision would directly impact the facility’s fate, Clinic President Julie Burkhart was nervous when she opened it. Reading quickly dispelled her fears, she said, as it dawned on her that the justices sided with the plaintiffs’ legal team. 
“We are delighted,” she told WyoFile.  
Many people questioned her 2021 decision to open an abortion clinic in such a conservative state, she said. The court decision solidifies an intuition she felt back then about Wyoming residents’ sense of what’s fair and right. 
Burkhart and colleagues expect future challenges to arise, however. 
“While we celebrate today’s ruling, we know that anti-abortion politicians will continue their push to restrict access to health care in Wyoming with new, harmful proposals in the state legislature,” Burkart said in a statement. “Patients should not have to live in fear that their health care decisions will be suddenly upended at the whim of a judge or lawmaker.”
Across the state in Jackson, Dr. Anthony anticipates the Wyoming Freedom Caucus will attempt to pass laws that impose targeted restrictions against abortion providers — such as forcing patients to hear a fetal heartbeat or wait a certain time period before the procedure. 
“Unfortunately, the fight’s not over,” Anthony said, “but this is a great moment for us.”
Heartache 
Abortion opponents expressed sadness Tuesday and vehemently disagreed with the court’s opinion. 
State Rep. Rachel Rodriguez Williams was lead sponsor of one of the abortion bans. The Cody Republican and chair of the Wyoming Freedom Caucus did not respond to a request for comment, but posted about the decision on X. 
“My heart aches for Wyoming today,” Rodriguez Williams posted. “Thanks to the decision of four unelected, unchecked attorneys, it’s open season in Wyoming for innocent, preborn babies. Make no mistake: courts can get things wrong, and they sure did get this wrong. I’ll never stop fighting to protect life.”

Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray also protested the decision, which he called “outrageously wrong” and “a leftwing activist decision totally out of touch with the Wyoming Constitution.”
Natrona County anti-abortion activist Bob Brechtel, a former Wyoming House member, also expressed frustration with the courts, criticizing the nearly two-year-long wait for a decision and saying he was “ashamed” of the outcome from the high court. 
In 2011, Brechtel co-sponsored the bill authorizing a later-successful constitutional amendment ballot measure that now protects individuals’ rights to make their own health care decisions. Born out of opposition to the Obama-era Affordable Care Act, what became Article 1, Section 38 caused some lawmakers to worry about potential unintended consequences. 
Fifteen years later, one unintended consequence came to fruition. Reached Tuesday, Brechtel confirmed that he did not intend to protect women’s right to have an abortion in Wyoming. 
“There was nothing in the legislation about killing innocent human beings,” he said. “This whole thing has been completely regenerated into something that it was never intended to be.”

,Mississippi Today,2026-01-06 22:55:57+00:00,Mississippi Today,FAQ: What is school choice? What are Mississippi lawmakers considering?,Devna Bose,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/06/faq-what-is-school-choice-mississippi-legislature/,"Students walk to their classrooms on the first day of school at Callaway High School in Jackson, Miss., on Monday, July 28, 2025.","The school-choice debate has simmered for years in Mississippi. But now that the 2026 legislative session has started, the issue is expected to come to a head.
You’ve probably heard the term “school choice,” but as lawmakers on both sides of the issues have argued their cases in the weeks leading up to the session that kicked off Tuesday at noon, you may have gotten lost in the opposing points flying from both angles. Even more confusing, some politicians have renamed school choice as “education freedom” in an effort to further their agenda.
Here are answers to some frequently asked questions on what is on the table with the Mississippi Legislature on school choice and how it might impact public education. 
What is school choice? 
School choice is an umbrella term used to describe numerous policies and programs aimed at giving parents more say over where their child is educated and the kind of education they receive. That often includes using public tax dollars to fund their choices, including for private schooling. 
What are the different kinds of school choice?
Different types of school choice include charter schools, public school open enrollment or “portability” and private school-choice programs. Private programs include education savings accounts, vouchers and tax credit scholarships — ways parents can use public money for private education options.  
What are ESAs?
Education savings accounts, or ESAs, give parents public-funded government savings accounts to use toward their children’s education. Parents can put this money toward curriculum, tutoring, school tuition, among other things. Some lawmakers, including Speaker Jason White, have signaled that a universal ESA program — a program that would at least be partially open to all students, regardless of income or group — would be their ideal policy.

What are vouchers?
Vouchers differ slightly from ESAs. They allocate the public funding that would typically have been sent to a public school for a child’s education to parents to use toward tuition at a private school. 
What are tax-credit scholarships? 
There are various kinds of tax-credit programs, including tax-credit scholarships, tax-credit ESAs and refundable tax credits. All of these programs give parents a tax break for spending money on alternative education for their child. 
What are charter schools?
Charter schools are publicly funded but operate outside the regulations that apply to traditional public schools. Charter schools can be established in Mississippi in areas where the local school district is rated A, B or C if the district’s school board approves, and without board approval in areas rated D or F.  The state charter board has pushed for loosening this policy. 
What is portability?
Public school portability, or open enrollment, refers to policies that aim to make student transfers easier, or even automatic and have tax dollars follow the pupil. Currently, a student’s home school district has veto power over a student switching to a school in a different district, which could make transfers nearly impossible.  One proposal from Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann, pending in the Senate, would remove the home district’s veto ability. 
Does Mississippi have school choice? 
Mississippi already has various forms of school choice, though they are limited. Mississippi has a couple of voucher programs and an education savings account program, all for students with disabilities. Mississippi also has various private schools and charter schools. Students can also transfer to public school districts outside of their area, as long as both school districts approve the move. 
How many other states have school choice?
According to Education Week, 30 states and the District of Columbia have at least one private school choice program. In the Southeast, six out of nine states have a universal school-choice program.

What do opponents say?
People against school choice often argue that the policies siphon money away from public schools, which they argue are a public good funded with taxpayer dollars, and often send that money to schools with less oversight than traditional public schools.

What do supporters say?
Proponents of school choice say that parents deserve final say over their child’s education and, as taxpayers, should get money to fund those choices.  
READ MORE: School choice debate: Should private schools have to meet state standards if they take public money?
Who supports it?
Conservative think tanks, such as Americans for Prosperity, have led the push for expanded school-choice policies across the country. Various local municipalities have passed resolutions against expanding school choice in recent months. And while school choice favor in the House has quietly grown, the Senate still appears lukewarm, which could make for a standoff this session.

(Photo by Willie B. Thomas/Getty Images)Leaders of New Mexico’s healthcare exchange are reporting a third straight year of enrollment increases, even as federal healthcare tax credits expire and average premiums are set to rise in 2026. 
As of Monday, with more than a week until open enrollment ends, more than 81,000 New Mexicans had signed up for medical and/or dental coverage through BeWell, the state’s exchange, including more than 9,400 new enrollees. 
That’s an increase from 2025, when a little more than 71,000 New Mexicans enrolled, and from 2024, when about 57,000 New Mexicans enrolled, according to BeWell data.
Alex Sanchez, the chief experience officer of BeWell, told Source New Mexico on Tuesday that the steady increases reflect the exchange’s marketing efforts and year-long community engagement. 
Six things to know about Enhanced Premium Tax Credits heading into New Mexico’s special session

Extending the Affordable Care Act subsidies Congress created in 2021 emerged as the main factor that prompted a federal government shutdown late last year. Republicans did not agree to extend the subsidies, so millions of Americans already face huge increases in annual premiums this year. 
The tax credits offered significant savings to health care costs, with some estimates suggesting annual premiums could increase by $1,500 for those who no longer get the tax credits.  
In advance of the lost tax credits, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and state lawmakers during a special session in October approved $17.3 million to cover costs of tax credits the federal government previously covered for a little more than 6,000 New Mexicans whose income is more than 400% of the federal poverty level. That built on a previous allocation covering others during the regular session in January 2025.
Sanchez also credits the state coverage as a factor in the increased enrollment here, and noted the discrepancy between New Mexico and states that did not cover the lost credits, such as Pennsylvania, which saw a 16% decline in enrollees already this year. 
“It’s just terrible to see our other states who are really struggling, who didn’t have the commitment that we had from our elected officials,” Sanchez said. 
The money allocated in New Mexico  will run out by the end of the state’s fiscal year ending June 30, but Lujan Grisham has already promised the state will continue to cover the expired tax credits. 
Feds award New Mexico $211.5 M for rural health funding

In a news release from her office on Tuesday, she noted that her budget proposal from the upcoming session seeks to extend the assistance beyond June 30. 
She is seeking $81.1 million to cover the credits, according to budget documents her office released in December. 
“The Republican-controlled Congress is forcing families to endure a massive premium hike in the new year, and New Mexico won’t stand for it,” Lujan Grisham said in a statement. “We created the Health Care Affordability Fund for moments like this — when Washington fails to protect working families and the most vulnerable among us. 
Lujan Grisham’s statement noted that New Mexico’s congressional delegation all pushed to extend the premium tax credits, and a statement from Health Care Authority Secretary Kari Armijo urged Congress to take up the issue.
“Congress created this cliff, and Congress can avoid it by extending enhanced premium tax credits so people in every state can keep coverage within reach,” Armijo said. “We urge immediate action to prevent families from having to choose between health care and rent, groceries or gas.”

The public school transfer bill is the first major policy proposal that a legislative committee has advanced this year enhancing school choice, the issue many expect to headline the session. 
School choice refers to numerous policies and programs to give parents more say on where and how their children are educated, often by letting them use public money. The school-choice movement, backed by national conservative groups, has grown nationally, and is being pushed by the Trump administration.
READ MORE: Lawmakers want to expand ‘school choice’ in Mississippi. Here’s what it looks like in neighboring states
The policy approved by the Senate committee would make it easier for parents to send their children to public schools outside of their home districts. Currently, both the home school district and the receiving school district have to approve a student’s transfer. The proposal removes the home district’s veto power. 
Lawmakers also took the committee’s vote on Tuesday as an opportunity to draw a line in the sand: Vouchers, which give parents public dollars to fund education outside of traditional public schools, are not on the table in the Senate, said Senate Education Chairman Dennis DeBar. That’s in opposition to the House, where support for expansive school-choice policies has been quietly growing, thanks to a full-court press from the other chamber’s leader, House Speaker Jason White. 
DeBar, a Republican from Leaksville, said loosening public school district transfer regulations would allow parents a greater voice in their child’s education. But he said the proposal will change little else from current law aside from the home district’s veto power and will not conflict with any standing school desegregation orders under which some areas of Mississippi still operate. 
The money the state allocates to districts for teaching each pupil, a little less than $7,000 a year, would follow the transferring student, but receiving districts under the Senate bill would retain their power to charge a fee for admitting these out-of-area students to offset the cost of accepting students not in their tax base. They also still would have to provide some rationale for turning students away. 
Sen. Rod Hickman, a Democrat from Macon, took issue with districts’ ability to charge public school students a fee. 
“Doesn’t it further exacerbate the socioeconomic issue?” he asked. “If we say we’re giving parents a choice to educate their children, particularly to leave a bad district … to then say you can charge a fee, doesn’t it allow one set of people to be able to do that and another set of people not to be able to do that?”
Nancy Loome, a public school advocate and leader of the Parents Campaign, was similarly concerned, but lauded the Senate Education Committee’s strong stance against school vouchers. 
“I really worry about creating a system of haves and have-nots, where children who have fewer resources also have many fewer options,” she said. 
DeBar said all of the committees’ efforts on Tuesday were in service of the state’s public schools. 
“We need to support our public schools,” he said. “To come out and say this hurts public schools, I do take offense to that. 
The committee also advanced a long-awaited teacher pay raise, amounting to $2,000 a year. DeBar said he hopes the Legislature can eventually increase that raise to $5,000 a year, assuming the state isn’t bogged down with other expenses.
The pay raise would extend to teacher assistants, as well as professors at community colleges and universities, and there are financial consequences for school districts that avoid increasing teacher assistant pay by lowering the local contribution in response to the state-funded raise. 
The last meaningful teacher pay raise, also about $5,000, was in 2022, but teachers said it was quickly eaten up by inflation and insurance premium increases. Educators say the state’s teacher shortage, which stands at 3,815 vacancies statewide according to the Mississippi Department of Education, is largely fueled by the abysmal pay. Mississippi teachers, on average, are the lowest paid in the country.
Senators also took a shot at addressing the state’s teacher shortage by making it easier for retirees to return to teaching, or teach for the first time. The new bill would allow any person in the state public employee pension system to teach without forfeiting their retirement benefits. 
Sen. Hob Bryan, a Democrat from Amory, expressed concerns about how the bill would impact funding in the Public Employees Retirement System. He questioned whether the proposal would lead people to rush to retirement and return to the classroom the next day, getting to draw down retirement pay as well as a salary. 
“I’m just saying, it’s in the financial interest for every single person to do that,” he said. “I think we’re going to transfer the cost of paying teachers to the retirement system.”
The education committee’s affirmative vote on the retiree bill came just minutes after the Senate Appropriations Committee voted to add $1 billion over a decade into the pension system. 
All of these measures can now be considered by the full Senate chamber. The House Education Committee is set to meet Wednesday afternoon.

To recap, American troops entered Venezuela early Saturday morning and captured President Nicolás Maduro. The news reportedly caught many members of Congress, which has the authority to declare war, by surprise, as well as President Donald Trump’s pronouncement later that day that the United States will “run the country.” 
Many Democrats from across the country raised concerns that the strike violated the U.S. Constitutions’ separation of powers  — Article I gives Congress authority to declare war — and lacked foresight. 
Republicans, meanwhile, largely praised the outcome as well as the strike’s precision. And most GOP lawmakers appeared to accept the administration’s assertion that the move was not an act of war, which would require Congressional approval, but a law enforcement operation. Maduro had been indicted in 2020 on multiple charges, including narco-terrorism conspiracy, and will stand trial in federal court.
But not every lawmaker followed the party lines.
Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman has emerged as arguably the most vocal Democratic cheerleader of the administration’s actions, and its approach to foreign policy more broadly.
Two swing district Republicans, Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick and Ryan Mackenzie, have struck a more cautious tone than their GOP colleagues, warning against a prolonged deployment of American forces in the country. Fitzpatrick also joined Democrats in calling for Congress to reassert its war-making powers and for the administration to work more closely with lawmakers.

While a clear picture of Venezuela’s future, and America’s role in it, is still emerging, the Capital-Star reached out to each member of the commonwealth’s delegation with a list of questions and a request for each member’s response. Their replies ranged from written answers to issued statements to links to social media posts. One member, Democratic Rep. Madeleine Dean, agreed to a phone interview.

Fitzpatrick is a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Chairman of its subcommittee on the CIA (the intelligence agency was reportedly involved in the Venezuela operation), and a member of the subcommittee on Open-Source Intelligence.
He released a statement on Jan. 3
“Three statements of fact regarding our foreign policy as it pertains to Venezuela:
“1. Nicolás Maduro is an illegitimate narco-terror dictator. He terrorized his people, dismantled democratic institutions, and turned the machinery of government into a state-backed criminal enterprise — exporting drugs and cartel violence into the United States, with devastating consequences for hundreds of thousands of American lives. His ouster and prosecution are long overdue. We are thankful for the incredible bravery of the men and women of the U.S. military and our national security professionals.  
“2. The only country that the United States of America should be ‘running’ is the United States of America. The United States should join the international community in monitoring and overseeing a free and fair election in Venezuela, allowing the Venezuelan people a pathway to a true democracy. 
“3. We must all place paramount importance on lawful process and constitutional responsibility. The Authorized Use of Military Force (AUMF) resolutions have been interpreted by multiple presidents, under multiple scenarios, to cover groups and situations not initially envisioned, leading to debates about the balance of power between the Article I and Article II branches of government. As the Chairman of the CIA Subcommittee on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, we will continue our coordination and collaboration with CIA Director John Ratcliffe. Important information will be shared in forthcoming briefings, and we will continue our active role of proper congressional oversight. What is already clear, however, is this: terrorists, tyrants, dictators, and drug lords must always be met by justice and the rule of law; the extraordinary men and women of our military and intelligence community are the finest in the world; and the future of a free and democratic Venezuela belongs to the Venezuelan people alone.”

Dwight Evans (D-03)
Evans answered a series of submitted questions from the Capital-Star via email.
Capital-Star: Do you support the recent removal and arrest of Nicolas Maduro by the U.S. using military force?
Evans: No!
CS: What do you think Congress’ role should have been in this action, if any, and do you believe it should have a role in approving any military activity in Venezuela or other countries going forward?
Evans : I oppose the Trump-Vance administration’s unauthorized and unconstitutional military actions in Venezuela. Once again, this administration has no regard for the rule of law, risking American lives in and near Venezuela. I voted last month for a resolution that would have barred President Trump from military action against Venezuela without authorization by Congress, but House Republicans narrowly defeated it. Trump can’t even run our country well and now he’s focused on trying to run another one – and threatening to attack other countries.
U.S. Rep. Dwight Evans (D-3rd District)
America does not need another ill-conceived ‘forever war.’ We have serious problems here at home that Democrats in Congress will keep pushing to address, like Trump letting health-insurance premiums skyrocket Jan. 1 for 22 million Americans. I will continue to fight for Philadelphians and oppose this backwards, disastrous Trump-Vance agenda!
CS: Is there any specific action you believe Congress should take now in response to the recent actions?
Evans: Congress should pass legislation to rein Trump in like the war powers resolution I voted for last month.
CS: President Trump has said he’s open to putting “boots on the ground” or striking Venezuela again if his administration deems it necessary. He’s also suggested the U.S. should have a role in governing the country. What do you think the U.S. role in Venezuela should be going forward?
Evans: The Trump-Vance administration should NOT be taking further military action in Venezuela or the waters off its coast. These illegal actions need to STOP.
Madeleine Dean (D-04)
Rep. Madeleine Dean, a Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and the co-chair of the Bipartisan Fentanyl Prevention Caucus, agreed to an interview with the Capital-Star on Monday. The following excerpts were edited for length and clarity.
Dean said she learned about the military action along with the public when she woke up Saturday, seeing news of the attack on her TV. In subsequent discussions with Democratic colleagues, she learned that neither House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), Sen. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), nor Ranking Member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee Gregory Meeks (D-NY) were alerted by the administration either. 
U.S. Rep Madeleine Dean (D-4th District)
“That to me is a grotesque abuse of power by this president and his administration,” Dean told the Capital-Star. “They had an obligation to come to Congress first. They had actually said the words that before they would go into Venezuela, they would come to Congress, as required.”
She rejected the administration’s argument that the capture of Maduro was a “law enforcement” operation. 
“Listen to the president,” she said “He spoke first and he said this was a military operation. And he followed that with ‘And we are going to run Venezuela.’ When you go in with a number of air vehicles, and military, and CIA, and whoever else was involved in what was apparently a remarkably well-executed event by our military and intelligence folks — when you go in and seize the leader of a sovereign nation, this is an act of war … Secretary Rubio after [Trump] tried to change the tenor of it and said that it was a police action. Well, it wasn’t a simple arrest. The president himself said it was a military action.”
On the operation itself, Dean praised the U.S. military’s planning and execution
“I’m with [Republicans] in terms of praising the skill of the operation,” she said. “The level of planning and preparation — it’s awesome, what our military can do. I have absolute full confidence in our military. What I don’t have confidence in is the set of decisions that the Commander-in-Chief is making, and that the people in his administration are making. I am in awe of our military, of their service to this country, but I am also mindful that this president has the power and the responsibility not to put them wrongly in harm’s way.”
In particular, Dean said she’s worried about a lack of long-term plan for stability in Venezuela and Latin America.
“The danger here is they don’t have a plan,” she said. “Not only do they not have a plan, not only are they acting lawlessly and recklessly, my fear is that the president talked about the possibility of ‘boots on the ground.’ I worry about military members who are my constituents, military members who are Pennsylvanians, who might be called into this mess. So I call upon my Republican colleagues in Congress in Pennsylvania, like Scott Perry, a veteran himself, to say, ‘No way. This is not what we’re going to do — your crazy, imperialist ideas.’ And remember, allegedly, we picked [Maduro] up for drugs, narcotics trafficking. But the president revealed exactly what this is about. This is about oil. The oil wealth of that nation. So I expect Republican members to stand up alongside the Democrats and say Congress is the authority here in terms of going to war, and we have to demand that of the president and his reckless administration…”
“Don’t mistake any of my grave concern over this for any sympathy for Mr. Maduro. I’m glad he’s out of power.  I hope he’s brought to justice. But guess what? In December, as these boat strikes were going on, who did President Trump pardon? [Former president of Honduras Juan Orlando] Hernández, who was arrested, indicted and convicted for the exact same parallel charges [as Maduro] … This president isn’t serious at all about drugs.”
Dean was equally alarmed about the Trump administration suggesting more military action could be possible in countries like Cuba, Colombia and NATO ally Greenland. Along with the possibility of U.S. military deployment, she said she’s worried about the long-term effects the rhetoric will have on America’s standing and influence on the global stage.
“Look at how irresponsible the president is in signaling these things, and how juvenile,” she said. “In the press conference, he talked about the Monroe Doctrine, and said, ‘Some are calling it the Donroe Doctrine.’ He is so arrested in his development, and in his curiosity, and in his responsibility as the Commander-in-Chief. Someone has sewn these ideas of an imperialistic Donald Trump conquering the hemisphere. So the president is in, I think, a very precarious place. He sees himself as being bigger than life. I see him as shrinking. What he did with this move on Venezuela, without the consultation of Congress, without a plan for the day after, and the day after that, reduced his influence in the world. How does this president now talk to Mr. Putin and say, ‘You know what? What you did in Ukraine was wrong.’ He just reduced his own global influence in a most dangerous way. And these idol chit-chats around Greenland, around Canada, around Cuba, around Colombia, around Mexico, it’s very dangerous.”
Asked what lawmakers should do to reassert their constitutional war powers and rein in the Trump administration, Dean called on members of his own party to act.
“I expect Republican members to demand better, to actually find their spines, their backbones, and their constitutional authority under Article One, which has been drained away from them, and demand briefings … We have to absolutely together demand accountability of this administration. They need to let us decide whether we want to be at war … I am gravely concerned that this president’s seeing oil dollar signs in his eyes, and cares not enough about risking American bloodshed.”
Republicans, largely, have praised the Trump administration’s actions. And many, at least publicly, have brushed aside concerns that Trump’s action required congressional authorization.
Asked what congressional Democrats should do if they don’t receive GOP support, Dean offered few specifics.
“We caucused yesterday, so I won’t tell you what was said, but we are going to do everything in our power to stand up to the president, and to push Republican members, including the speaker of the House, to understand their responsibilities under Article One, and to reclaim them,” she said. “We will use every lever we can. Take a look at what we’re facing right now. The American people are facing increased health care premiums. Many of my constituents are losing health care because they simply cannot afford it. My constituents are livid that we would go to war and pretend that we can run that country when this president hasn’t shown he can run the one he’s in charge of.
“What I tell my constituents, my friends and family, is that it’s on all of us,” she continued. “We [Democrats] are in the minority, but we can be very noisy, we can be very vocal, and we will continue to be, and it will grow. But it’s on every citizen to say this is an unacceptable, grotesque use of power by this administration … I have confidence that people are hungry for ethical, competent government. We’re going to see this thing tip over. A lot of people are going to get hurt in the meantime.”

Chrissy Houlahan (D-06)
Houlahan did not respond to outreach from the Capital-Star, but shared  a critical statement from ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee Adam Smith (D-Wa.)  on social media.
She is one of six Democratic members of congress, all veterans, who released a video last year urging military service members not to follow unlawful orders. The move was called “seditious” by Trump, and has prompted the FBI to seek interviews with the lawmakers.
Addending Smith’s statement, Houlahan wrote:

Ryan Mackenzie (R-07)
Arnaud Armstrong, a spokesperson for Mackenzie, provided a statement in response to questions from the Capital-Star.
Like Fitzpatrick — another Republican representing a swing district — Mackenzie praised the U.S. military action, but warned against long-term involvement in Venezuela’s governance.
“Congressman Mackenzie remains opposed to foreign military interventions that lead to unnecessary, protracted conflicts abroad, like the ‘forever wars’ we have been involved with for the past few decades,” Armstrong wrote. “That’s why he led the way in Congress on repealing outdated AUMFs [Authorizations for Use of Military Force] in the most recent NDAA [National Defense Authorization Act]. 
Republican U.S. Rep. Ryan Mackenzie, PA-07. (Official photo)
“Congressman Mackenzie understands that while the focus of this effort in Venezuela was to capture an indicted narcoterrorist who was illegitimately claiming to be the president of Venezuela through fraudulent elections, we must now ensure that the Venezuelans quickly move to self-governance and that the U.S. does not get involved in another long-term conflict.”
Mackenzie himself released the following statement: “The capture of Nicolás Maduro is a decisive victory for U.S. security and regional stability. Maduro was an illegitimate dictator and narcoterrorist who funneled drugs into the United States — killing countless young Americans. As a result of this operation, the United States, the western hemisphere, and the broader world are safer and more secure.”
“With Maduro’s reign now toppled, and American justice on the horizon, we look forward to working alongside the Venezuelan people to establish a democratic and prosperous nation that no longer poses a threat to American families. We thank American servicemembers for their bravery, ingenuity, and success, and we pray for a swift recovery for all those who were injured. We are grateful that there have not been any immediate fatalities among our armed forces.”
Rob Bresnahan (R-08)
Bresnahan responded to questions from the Capital-Star with an emailed statement:
“Nicolás Maduro is a thug who stole an election and ran a narcoterrorist regime disguised as a government that spread violence, drugs, and chaos that cost thousands of American lives. The world is safer today because the United States acted decisively and stood up to evil.”
“Our troops are the best in the world, and I am grateful to those who carried out this mission with unmatched skill and bravery.”
Dan Meuser (R-09)
A spokesperson for Meuser pointed the Capital-Star to a statement posted on social media shortly after the capture of Maduro.

Lee responded to questions from the Capital-Star with an emailed statement:
“Invading a foreign country without congressional approval and kidnapping its leader is a blatant violation of U.S. and international law. This sets a dangerous precedent that threatens international stability and security, puts Americans further at risk, and infringes on the sovereignty of foreign countries. Congress must act and reassert its authority. We must pass a War Powers Resolution and stop this unilateral executive action immediately.”

Joyce responded to questions from the Capital-Star with an emailed statement
“Nicolas Maduro’s criminal and corrupt reign is over thanks to the courage, bravery, and heroism of the service members who carried out this past weekend’s targeted operation.

Reschenthaler responded to questions from the Capital-Star with an emailed statement
“President Trump and our nation’s warfighters successfully executed an operation to bring Nicolas Maduro to justice. Maduro is an indicted narco-terrorist who enabled the ruthless Venezuelan cartels that funnel lethal drugs into the United States. This precise and decisive action demonstrates to our adversaries what happens when you place Americans in danger. President Trump has once again made our nation safer.”

Renee Gamela, a spokesperson for Thompson, responded to questions from the Capital-Star with a statement.
“Maduro has been indicted since 2020 and his regime has not been considered legitimate. An interim president is now in place, and it is Congressman Thompson’s hope that any further intervention will be minimal. This arrest should serve as a warning for other bad actors who put their personal interests ahead of their people and the rule of law.”
Mike Kelly (R-16)
A spokesperson for Kelly pointed the Capital-Star to a statement released on Jan. 3, shortly after the capture of Maduro.
“Today, President Trump has once again shown the world that the United States will defend itself from terrorism of all kinds, including narcoterrorism led by Venezuela’s illegitimate leader Nicolás Maduro,” said Rep. Kelly. “For years, I’ve sounded the alarm about foreign intervention against the United States throughout the Western Hemisphere. This includes illegal drug trafficking into our country. Today’s tactical military operation in Venezuela is the Trump Doctrine in action. This is the right time to have the right president in the White House.”
Chris Deluzio (D-17)
A spokesperson for Deluzio shared a statement released on Jan. 3. 
Deluzio drew the ire of the Trump administration as one of six Democratic members of Congress, all military service veterans, who released a video urging troops not to follow illegal orders.
“Neither the American people nor the United States Congress has authorized an invasion of Venezuela, a war with Venezuela, or a military occupation of Venezuela. We have enough problems here at home in America that President Trump is failing to fix; we do not need a reckless and unconstitutional foreign military occupation that would drain precious American blood and treasure.”
“To the young people of Pennsylvania: Should you die for regime change and an occupation of Venezuela? To Pennsylvanian parents and grandparents: Should your children or grandchildren be sent to risk their lives? More to the point — in a Constitutional Republic such as ours, no President has the power to send American troops into war and occupation like this.”
U.S. Rep. Chris Deluzio (D-17th District)
“Our Constitution is clear: the American people through our representatives in Congress have the sole power to declare war and send Americans to topple foreign governments and occupy foreign lands. Yet, Donald Trump thinks the American people have no say in any of this and that we should all foot the bill for his unconstitutional actions in Venezuela.”
“Maduro is an illegitimate and brutal dictator who stole an election to cling to power. He is hardly alone across the globe, yet it is not the American people’s responsibility to launch regime change wars against every foreign despot.”
“My generation of veterans knows the heavy costs and long-lasting wounds of unnecessary forever wars fueled by a lust for oil abroad. No more. No Americans should bleed and die in an unnecessary war and occupation that the American people have not approved. Congress needs to grow a spine and take back authority over war powers. My constitutional oath is sacred, and I will do everything in my power to defend our Constitution.”
Sen. John Fetterman
Fetterman did not respond to questions from the Capital-Star. In an interview with Fox News on Jan. 5, Fetterman reiterated that support, and support for the Trump administration’s foreign policy approach more broadly. In particular, he compared the military action in Venezuela to America’s strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities last year. He noted the direct approach in that instance did not appear to cause the kind of regional chaos critics warned about, and said he’s hopeful for a similar outcome in Latin America following the capture of Maduro.
Fetterman also praised the Trump administration for giving Maduro a trial, as opposed to assassinating him, and brushed off concerns raised by primarily Democratic lawmakers about the lack of transparency and consultation prior to military deployment.

The following is an excerpt from that Fox News interview, edited for length and clarity:
“[Venezuelans are] celebrating these kinds of things. We want to remember the kinds of chaos and suffering that Maduro brought to Venezuela. Why can’t we call this a good development now, and be open to better kinds of outcomes for that nation? Our nation was forced to absorb over 500,000 Venezuelans … This wasn’t a war. This wasn’t ‘boots on ground’ in that kind of way. This was surgical and very efficient. I want to celebrate our military.”
“Now they’re also putting [Maduro] on trial. They didn’t assassinate him. They didn’t disappear him. He’s actually on our TV right now, and they’re gonna give him a trial.”
“I’d like to also make a point: so many people were freaking out about the Iranian strikes last year. I absolutely called for those things, and I supported those kinds of things. The Middle East didn’t just spiral. It’s actually much more peaceful. Now, many of the members of BRICS [a group of countries designated as having emerging economies in the early 2000s, including Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa] are absolutely paying attention to what happened in Venezuela. If I’m in Iran, I’m thinking, ‘Woah. Maybe I won’t talk so tough anymore.’ It just reminds people that we have the capabilities to touch you wherever you are. Now I think things are going to be more stable, if anything … So, for me, I’m open for better opportunities, and I have to call it necessarily positive. I can’t just condemn it because I happen to be a Democrat.”
Sen. Dave McCormick
McCormick did not respond to outreach from the Capital-Star, but on Jan. 5, he shared a clip from a Fox News interview on social media.
“It was a great day for the Venezuelan people. It was a great day for our military … an incredible operation that was executed with great competence and great lethality. And what a great day for the President, who demonstrated once again that he’s willing to fight for America’s interests.

“And Venezuela, under Maduro, was killing Americans, killing Pennsylvanians — a major transshipment center. 4,000 Pennsylvanians died last year from drug overdoses. Venezuela is part of the reason for that. It was also a host to Iran, China and Russia — many of our adversaries, where they could essentially launch terrorist kinds of activities on American soil. So this was a fight for America’s interests, and the President, and the team and the military executed it brilliantly.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/venezuela2026-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-06 17:57:55.543264

One of the deaths was reported by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health earlier this week, while the second was confirmed overnight, bringing the statewide total of pediatric flu-related deaths this season to four.
“This is obviously a devastating loss for both of their families,” Boston Public Health Commissioner Dr. Bisola Ojikutu said Tuesday. “And we actually in Boston have not had a pediatric flu death since 2013 so it’s clear that we’re having a particularly bad season, particularly for children.”
When asked by reporters if the two children who died were vaccinated, especially vulnerable, or faced an aggressive flu strain, Ojikutu declined to give specific details, citing patient confidentiality.
The U.S. is experiencing a sharp increase in flu activity
In the last two weeks of December, confirmed cases among children under 5 in Boston rose 142 percent, according to ata presented by Ojikutu. Emergency department visits for influenza-like illness among that age group increased 225 percent, and hospitalizations “nearly tripled” over the same period.
Compared with last flu season, Boston has already seen twice as many pediatric flu hospitalizations, Ojikutu said, and hospitalizations among children under 5 have exceeded last season’s peak — even though flu season is “nowhere near our peak yet.”
The Massachusetts Department of Public Health is reporting “very high and rising levels of influenza activity” statewide, with nearly 9,000 emergency department visits per day last week, about one-quarter of them related to acute respiratory illness. As of late December, an estimated 20.5 percent of emergency department visits were tied to acute respiratory disease, according to DPH’s respiratory illness dashboard. Hospitals in some regions have reported capacity levels exceeding 90 percent, largely driven by influenza.
Ojikutu attributed the severity of the season to the aggressiveness of the circulating strain — H3N2, subtype K — and lagging vaccination rates.
“We do have a new subvariant that’s out there that is behaving in a more aggressive way,” she said. “And then our vaccination rates for the flu are low.”
About 32.5 percent of Boston residents received a flu vaccine as of December 27, Ojikutu said, compared with roughly 34 percent statewide. She said vaccination rates are only slightly lower than last year, but remain “overall low.”
“While the flu is usually mild, it can cause hospitalization and death,” Ojikutu said. “Children under the age of two are at higher risk.”
Public health officials stressed that most flu infections in children remain mild but urged parents and caregivers to seek immediate medical attention if children develop warning signs of severe illness. Those include trouble breathing, persistently high fever, extreme lethargy, confusion or signs of dehydration such as markedly decreased urination.
In babies, parents and caregivers should look for signs of escalating irritability, Ojikutu said. She encouraged them to bring their children to a medical provider if they had any questions or concerns.
“This can happen rather quickly when children have the flu,” Ojikutu said. “So it’s being aware of these signs and symptoms and then bringing kids into the emergency department as soon as possible.”
Both the Boston Public Health Commission and the state Department of Public Health are urging residents 6 months and older to get vaccinated, noting that this year’s flu vaccine was developed before the H3N2 subtype K strain became predominant. While that makes the vaccine a potential mismatch for the strain now circulating most widely, Ojikutu said available data show the vaccine still reduces the severity of illness, lowers the risk of hospitalization, and decreases the likelihood of death, particularly for young children and others at higher risk.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Cold_Flu_Child.png?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-06 17:57:55.543264

(Henry Redman | Wisconsin Examiner)The Wisconsin Assembly Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety on Tuesday held a public hearing on a pair of bills that would require homeless people on the state’s sex offender registry to wear ankle monitors and increase the penalty for selling drugs close to homeless shelters. 
Under the first bill, authored by Rep. Dave Maxey (R-New Berlin), people required to sign up for the sex offender registry and unable to provide a permanent address must be placed under GPS monitoring. An estimated 16% of Wisconsin’s homeless population is on the sex offender registry, according to Maxey, who said he wanted to make sure this population was not a blind spot for Department of Corrections monitoring of people on the list. 
“This bill is a clear and common-sense public safety measure that applies one uniform standard so every registrant is monitored at the same level, regardless of housing status,” Maxey said. “This is a straightforward way to protect every member of our society.”
A number of Democrats on the committee had concerns about putting the proposal into practice. 
Rep. Jodi Emerson (D-Eau Claire) wondered if the cost of the monitoring would end up being paid for by the state. 
“Most times, the GPS monitoring is paid for by the person who needs to wear it eventually,” Emerson said. “And if they don’t have the resources to afford a home, I don’t know if they’re going to have the resources to pay the state back for this. And is this something that we’re just going to end up incurring extra costs on? I’m trying to balance the cost versus safety factor.”
Rep. Sequanna Taylor (D-Milwaukee) noted that the ankle monitors need to be regularly charged, which might pose a challenge for people without a home. 
“When we talk about the GPS, I know even the people that are not in this situation, who may be on it, there are sometimes tweaks or glitches with them, and also the everyday charging, if we’re talking about someone who’s homeless, is not staying anywhere, I guess I’m just trying to see, how can we encompass or ensure that it will be charged, because once it’s not able to be charged and it’s off, are they meant to go report somewhere or is that a process we haven’t thought about yet?”
Another bill heard by the committee Tuesday, authored by Rep. Bob Donovan (R-Greenfield), would add homeless shelters to the list of places including schools, government buildings and public parks that are considered drug-free zones. Convictions for selling drugs within these zones carry harsher penalties. 
“Drug-related crimes pose a severe threat to community safety, particularly in areas where at-risk populations are located, current law wisely imposes enhanced penalties for distributing illegal drugs within 1,000 feet of sensitive locations like schools and parks, adding up to five years to the maximum sentence,” Donovan said. “These Drug Free Zones deter illegal activity and safeguard those who are most vulnerable. However, homeless shelters are not included in these protections. Many, many homeless individuals face profound challenges, including addiction and mental health issues. Extending these zones is about punishing malicious drug dealers who prey upon the homeless while providing basic security for them as they attempt to reenter society.”
But advocates for addiction treatment and criminal justice reform questioned the wisdom of the proposal. 
Dr. Charles Schauberger, an Onalaska resident and president of the Wisconsin Society of Addiction Medicine, said making homeless shelters a drug-free zone could increase police presence around a shelter, which might push homeless drug users away from the area and into more dangerous situations. 
“This legislation is not only ineffective in helping homeless people, but potentially worsens the situation,” Schauberger said. “Increasing criminal penalties for substance-related offenses near shelters may lead to increased law enforcement presence around these facilities for people who use substances they may carry, or may even carry a small amount for personal use, which creates a great deal of fear, fear of harassment, fear of incarceration, fear of losing the only safe place they have yet to go.”
He added that when people are afraid to use shelters, “they don’t disappear. They move further into unsafe spaces. They sleep outside. They use substances alone. They disengage from services. They increase risk of overdose. Medical emergencies, deaths make it much harder for clinicians like me to reach them.”
Amanda Merkwae, advocacy director of the ACLU of Wisconsin, said that while the proposal has an “admirable goal” it comes with unintended consequences. She said that in the state’s larger, denser cities, so much of the land is covered by various drug-free zones that lots of drug-related activity is punished there more harshly than in rural parts of the state. 
“In densely populated urban areas, that radius around each of these integrated locations overlaps to the point where sometimes an entire city can become functionally a drug-free zone,” she said, noting that the city of Milwaukee contains 156 public schools, 101 private schools, 12 multi-unit public housing facilities, four public swimming pools, dozens of youth and community centers, hundreds of child care facilities, six correctional facilities and more than 130 public parks. 
“So studies have shown that these zones don’t necessarily track where drug activity is most prevalent, but rather where certain populations are concentrated,” she said. “So we create this kind of two-tiered justice system based on geography rather than the nature of the crime. So residents in cities can face greater exposure to enhanced maximum penalties than those in rural or suburban areas for the exact same conduct.”

The Iowa Dental Board recently charged 74-year-old James Conrad Walgren with failure to maintain adequate safe and sanitary conditions for a dental office.
The board alleges that at some unspecified time in the past, it received a complaint “alleging areas of concern related to infection control” at Walgren’s practice. An inspection revealed what the board calls “some failures with regard to the sterilization of instruments,” which the board says Walgren has since addressed.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In order to resolve the case, the parties have agreed to a settlement that involves a $500 civil penalty. The settlement also calls for Walgren to complete a board-approved educational course focusing on infection control.
In addition, Walgren’s license has been placed on probation for two years, during which he will submit to worksite monitoring.
The monitoring program will require Walgren to hire a registered dental assistant or dental hygienist to assist with infection control and serve as a worksite monitor. The monitor will then submit quarterly reports to the board detailing the infection control measures that Walgren is following — such as sanitization of instruments and Walgren wearing a face mask as recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Prior sanctions were tied to cocaine use and sales
In May 1989, the board charged Walgren with nine separate regulatory violations, including failure to maintain a reasonable standard of competency, dishonorable or unprofessional conduct in the practice of dentistry by ingesting cocaine on numerous occasions between 1979 to 1988, diverting or distributing cocaine through his dental practice from 1979 to 1982, and selling cocaine to friends on at least one occasion in 1984.
The board also charged Walgren with an inability to practice dentistry with reasonable skill and safety due to the habitual or excessive use of drugs, habitual intoxication or addiction to the use of drugs, the willful or repeated prescribing or dispensing of drugs for illegal purposes, numerous instances of failing to record required information in patient records, and the willful or repeated prescribing or dispensing of drugs for uses not directly related to dentistry.
At the time, the board alleged Walgren had started using cocaine and marijuana during college from 1969 to 1973, continued using cocaine and marijuana while in dental school from 1974 to 1978, and then began practicing dentistry in Dubuque in July 1978.
According to the board, Walgren admitted to diverting about 20% of the clinic’s pharmaceutical cocaine to his own personal use, and to his friends’ use, from 1979 to 1982.
The board alleged Walgren also admitted to frequent use of cocaine from 1984 to 1986, and alleged that Walgren stated he had last used cocaine in early 1988 while vacationing in Jamaica.
The case was resolved with a board order suspending Walgren’s dental license for two years, followed by an indefinite period of probation and board supervision.

When a handful of  Red Onion State Prison inmates burned themselves in late 2024 amid allegations of racism and abuse, the Office of the State Inspector General (OSIG) launched an investigation into inmates’ claims of physical or sexual abuse, inhumane treatment, poor food quality and prolonged periods of isolation for some inmates.
Most of the claims have been found “unsubstantiated” by OSIG’s Corrections Ombudsman team in a report obtained by The Mercury Tuesday, while allegations of racism and retaliation against inmates have been deemed “inconclusive.”
Virginia’s new corrections ombudsman to prioritize Red Onion prison probe

This means that they could not be totally proven, nor disproven. 
With a series of both announced and unannounced visits to the Southwest Virginia prison, the investigation team reviewed more than 500 complaints it’d received, along with 77 incident reports that inmates had filed along with associated camera footage. The investigation was “limited to relevant circumstances as specified in the complaints,” the report stated. 
The sporadically redacted report outlined how interviews with inmates and correctional officers, along with reviews of incident reports and other evidence, led to OSIG’s conclusions. Among the redacted information was how many inmates burned themselves — a number disputed between prison reform activists and Virginia Department of Corrections Director Chad Dotson. 
Dotson told state lawmakers that six people burned themselves “using improvised devices that were created by tampering with electrical outlets,” while activists have asserted that closer to a dozen people harmed themselves in protest of the living conditions. 
Some correctional officers interviewed as part of the investigation believed the inmates who burned themselves were seeking transfer to be closer to their families — echoing a sentiment Dotson relayed last year. 
 Complaints about racism, religious discrimination and retaliation

The Mercury has communicated with Ekong Eshiet over the past year, one of the inmates who purportedly burned himself. He expressed concerns about officers retaliating against inmates who spoke out and said he felt unsafe around officers who’d purportedly taunted him for his Muslim faith. He has since transferred to an out-of-state-facility.
Other inmates relayed similar concerns in interview, saying they feared their access to phones or kiosks to transmit electronic communications would be limited, either in retaliation or as part of the regular operations. The report noted that phone access was a problem for inmates.  
Kenneth Hunter, a former Red Onion inmate who now frequents the Virginia State Capitol as an organizer with the Virginia Interfaith Center for Public Policy, said in an interview last year he spent prolonged time confined solitarily in Red Onion during his sentence for a nonviolent drug charge. He said he is “well aware” of the racism allegations that have stemmed from the facility.
Hunter, a Black man, recalled how large portions of his fellow inmates were Black, in contrast to the white correctional officers. Black people are also disproportionately incarcerated in Virginia, reports show. 
 ‘Unsubstantiated’ claims

Incarcerated people, their families and prison reform activists have repeatedly complained about what they call excessive use of solitary confinement. Though Virginia doesn’t technically label it as solitary confinement, “restorative housing” is a form of confined housing that is used in correctional facilities here.
A 2024 lawmaker-directed report by a consulting firm confirmed the use of restorative housing and signaled at least one, unnamed facility was not granting legally-required out-of-cell time for those who’d been isolated.
The new OSIG report shed more light on how restorative housing is used at Red Onion and found the facility had not abused the practice. The report said some inmates placed in restorative housing had chosen not to participate in out-of-cell time or had refused to comply with search procedures. 
“It is a safety concern when an inmate refuses to participate in search procedures and inmates are not allowed to leave their cell until they participate in search procedures,” the report stated.
The report dismissed other claims of medical or mental health neglect, poor food quality, inhumane living conditions and physical or sexual abuse. 
The probe also did not find Red Onion in noncompliance with VADOC’s grievance procedures, which must be addressed within 180 days of filing and requires inmates be notified at their completion. Review of a sexual harassment complaint and eight abuse complaints filed by a redacted name appear to have also cleared Red Onion staff of those allegations, per the OSIG report. 
The report noted “Additional information” concerning those allegations but the redactions make it difficult to ascertain the context. 
With the report concluded, investigators recommend the prison make complaint forms more accessible to residents and consider offering a course on self-advocacy and accessing health resources.

Dan McKee's State of the State 2025 address on Tuesday, Jan. 14, 2025. (Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)The second floor entrance to the floor of the Rhode Island House of Representatives will remain closed when Gov. Dan McKee unveils his 2026 State of the State address next week. But the rest of the State House will remain open for members of the public to exercise their constitutional right to assemble and speak out.
That is the plan per an agreement announced Tuesday by the Rhode Island chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) as part of a lawsuit against the McKee administration for blocking off the rotunda during last year’s “People’s State of the State” rally.
Most of the first floor of the State House will be open to the public during this year’s State of the State speech scheduled for Tuesday, Jan. 13.
“Our administration developed a plan to provide meaningful public access to the State House, including the rotunda, during the 2026 State of the State Address, while prioritizing the safety and security of all individuals present,” Olivia DaRocha, a spokesperson for McKee’s office, said in an email to Rhode Island Current. 
The agreement crafted by Attorney General Peter Neronha’s office guarantees public access to the rotunda and the hallways of the first floor of the State House with a small pathway cordoned off near the stairway to the second-floor House chamber where the speech takes place. Public access to designated third floor hallways will also be allowed.
But the decision to close the area at the entrance to the House chamber during McKee’s speech still dismayed advocates like Harrison Tuttle.
“The governor is still participating in restricting freedom of assembly,” said Tuttle, formerly director of Black Lives Matter RI PAC, which dissolved last year, in a phone interview Tuesday afternoon. “It’s childish.”
Tuttle was a lead plaintiff in a lawsuit against McKee filed Oct. 28, by the ACLU in U.S. District Court. The suit claimed the governor violated protesters’ First Amendment rights and requested a ruling be made ahead of the upcoming State of the State Address.
Tuttle now works as a warming center coordinator for the Rhode Island State Council of Churches.
Advocates organized by Black Lives Matter RI PAC had planned to gather in the rotunda during McKee’s 2025 speech to call on the governor to declare a public health emergency to shelter the state’s growing homeless population over the winter. But when people started to arrive around 5 p.m. on Jan. 14, 2025, they were met by State and Capitol Police. Stanchions cordoned off the rotunda declaring the space was “reserved for the State of the State through the Department of Administration” from 4:30 to 10 p.m. 
Blocked from State House Rotunda, ‘People’s State of the State’ moves one story down

Demonstrators were instead told to gather in the “Bell Room” on the first floor, tucked away from the State House’s main entrance and elevators. The rotunda remained vacant throughout McKee’s 2025 speech.
On Oct. 28, 2025, the ACLU sued McKee in U.S. District Court over claims the governor violated protesters’ First Amendment rights and a request that a ruling be made ahead of the upcoming State of the State Address.
Because of the new plan from the McKee administration, the ACLU is no longer seeking a preliminary injunction. But that doesn’t mean the ACLU is dropping its case, which has yet to go before Chief Judge John J. McConnell.
“For more than 50 years, the State House rotunda has served as an indispensable space for the exercise of First Amendment rights,” Steven Brown, executive director for the ACLU of Rhode Island, said in a statement.
Still, advocates are painting the agreement as a minor victory as they prepare to gather again to call on state leaders to provide additional care for Rhode Island’s homeless population.
“For too long in our state, people have not provided adequate enough care that is needed for our most marginalized people,” Tuttle said. “Whatever happens in the governor’s address is not going to address those who are most marginalized.”

Video footage of the arrest shows that, shortly after the camera lights were turned off, two Grand Rapids Police Department officers came up behind Jessica Plichta, an organizer with Grand Rapids Opponents of War who planned Saturday’s rally, to arrest her. 
Plichta can be heard in the footage saying “I am not resisting arrest, I am going peacefully” as she is handcuffed.
Plichta was arrested, according to a statement from a Grand Rapids police spokesperson, after being positively identified as involved in an earlier instance where protesters were marching in the roadway. 
“Over 25 announcements were made from the PA system of a marked police cruiser for the group to leave the roadway and relocate their activities to the sidewalk,” the statement continued. “Blocking traffic in this manner is a direct violation of city and state law. The group refused lawful orders to move this free speech event to the sidewalk and instead began blocking intersections until the march ended.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“I was put in the police car, and they drove me to a secondary location, because they said I was making a scene. And so they got me out at the secondary location,” she told WZZM following her arrest. “They had me bend over the police car, they patted me down, ruined my belongings, and then they put me back in the police car without buckling my seat belt and drove me to [the Kent County jail].” 
Plichta added that she was held for around three hours before being released, and as of Monday evening, had not received notice of official charges being filed. 
The Grand Rapids Police Department did not respond to questions from the Michigan Advance about whether official charges had been filed or what those specific charges would be. 
The police department also did not respond to questions about whether any other protesters were arrested based on that incident or other incidents at the rally, or if any additional arrests were expected. However, the police statement added that patrol officers at the scene were informed by their sergeant and watch commander that “if the individuals could be located, they were subject to arrest.”
Plichta expressed her disappointment at the police intervention at the protest, saying, “Why does Grand Rapids seem to be the only city in Michigan where protesting is illegal? I believe it’s our sacred right in this country to protest.”

This year, amid economic headwinds, the fate of yet another tax cut remains uncertain.
“There will be a revenue measure filed and passed at some point during this session. What that looks like? I’m not ready to say yet,” House Speaker David Osborne told reporters after adjournment on the first day of this year’s session Tuesday.
Osborne, R-Prospect, said lawmakers “continue to have discussions about different measures on tax policy.” 
Senate President Robert Stivers, R-Manchester, signaled a more cautious approach, saying Republicans should abide by the fiscal guardrails they established in a landmark 2022 law aimed at reducing the income tax while avoiding the kind of fiscal crisis that followed deep tax cuts in Kansas.

“I’d love to reduce it again, but then you start, ‘Well, what’s the next time? Where’s the next line?’” Stivers said. “We’ve drawn it. We’ve set it. We should abide by it.” 
The fiscal triggers for another half-percentage point reduction were barely missed in the most recent fiscal year, though some Republicans, notably House Majority Whip Jason Nemes, are still pushing lawmakers to approve another income tax cut this year. 
The 2022 law created a system of fiscal triggers based on state finances to determine when the state can afford to lower the income tax rate by a half-percentage point. Since then the Republican-controlled legislature has lowered the personal income tax rate from 5% to 3.5%, working toward a goal of eventually eliminating it. 
In the background of income tax cut discussions is a more challenging two-year state budget that lawmakers need to pass during the 60-day session. 
Kentucky expects a $156 million revenue shortfall for the current fiscal year, which economists attribute to uncertainty around trade and tariffs.
Osborne cited national, global and economic “uncertainty” when saying that this may be “the most difficult budget that we will have done since taking the majority.” Kentucky Republicans won control of the House in 2016 for the first time since 1920.
“Normally, when you think of difficult budget situations, you think of it in terms of not having money. And the fact of the matter is that we do have money and our revenues remain strong,” Osborne said. “Uncertainty is the enemy of a good budget, and we have a dramatic amount of uncertainty: Global uncertainty, national economy, things that are coming down (from) House Resolution 1 that we will have to deal with.” 
House Resolution 1, better known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, will cut Medicaid spending over 10 years by $880 billion. Congress approved the measure last summer. More than 1 in 3 Kentuckians depend on Medicaid to pay for their health care. 
“All of those things create uncertainty. And when you have uncertainty, you have a lot of opinions about how to address that and I think that they will require a lot of debate, a lot of conversations,” he said. “I don’t expect that to be contentious by and large, I just think that it’s genuine disagreements and differences in opinions.” 
Kentucky is “constantly looking for ways to make our delivery of services better,” Osborne said, to make sure safety net programs are “accomplishing the goals that they’re intended to” while “also being mindful of the fact that these are taxpayer dollars.” 
Sen. Chris McDaniel, the Republican chair of the Senate Appropriations and Revenue Committee, said last year that federal food assistance program costs shifted to states through the One Big Beautiful Bill Act could also amount to a $180 million “hit” to the budget. 
Senate President Stivers, of Manchester, gave a brighter outlook on the state budget, telling reporters that Republicans “feel like we’re pretty comfortable dealing with the budget as it currently exists.” Lawmakers also have the Budget Reserve Trust Fund to potentially rely on, also known as the state’s “rainy day” fund, which has more than $3.7 billion as of August 2025.
The GOP is expecting growth in the state’s receipts despite recent cuts to the state income tax, Stivers added.

Senate Democrats, who hold a small minority in the chamber, called for more transparency about fiscal matters ahead of lawmakers reconvening Tuesday. 
Senate Democratic Floor Leader Gerald Neal, of Louisville, said the caucus would focus on finding solutions to the state’s housing shortage, improving access to health care and education and increasing the state’s minimum wage. 
Neal repeatedly said Senate Democrats were concerned about future cost shifts from the federal government to states on programs like Medicaid and SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.
“We are beginning at the circumstances that demand both fiscal responsibility and moral seriousness,” Neal said. “Decisions made in Washington are already shifting costs onto states, counties and local communities. Our responsibility in Frankfort is to confront those realities head on and not contend that they do not exist.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_2711-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-06 17:57:55.543264

(Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — As lawmakers return for a new session, the Nebraska Capitol walls are lined with golden-colored, framed portraits of the signers of the Declaration of Independence distributed online by conservative nonprofit PragerU. 
The 82 paintings along the first-floor hallway highlight the 56 signers of the Declaration of Independence, key events from the founding of the United States and women of the American Revolution. The display is part of a push from the Trump administration’s White House Task Force 250, an outreach effort this year designed to celebrate America’s semiquincentennial. 
The White House has sent letters to state governors and leaders encouraging them to put the “Founders Museum” in state capitols, schools and embassies, NPR has reported. The White House also partnered with Hillsdale College to produce a history video series. Some view the Christian liberal arts school of about 2,000 students in Michigan as a conservative alternative to traditional higher education.

Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen said the purpose of hosting the exhibit is to let the state “celebrate the country’s 250th anniversary” and do things that put Nebraska on the map.
The state also unveiled a logo for the semiquincentennial and a website link listing upcoming events in the state and nationally for the 250th anniversary. The state’s Semiquincentennial Commission sponsored the “Founders Museum” at the Capitol, officials said.
Conservative radio host Dennis Prager and Allen Estrin, Prager’s producer at the time, founded PragerU in 2009 to produce short videos on viewing historical, economic and climate issues using a conservative lens. The group has touted itself as a “free alternative to the dominant left-wing ideology in culture, media and education.”

PragerU has faced criticism for sharing content historians consider misleading and inaccurate. The nonprofit has pushed the view that the U.S. was founded on“Judeo-Christian values” and it is and should remain a Christian nation. 
When asked about the leanings of the nonprofit and criticisms of it, Pillen said that if people have a problem, he would tell them, “Hey, we’re the United States of America. We are Americans.” 
“Let’s celebrate America together and focus on unity, and let’s not get distracted by the 1/10 of 1%,” Pillen said, referring to what he described as the far ends of both sides.

U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon has said the traveling exhibit is dedicated “to the purpose of patriotic civics education in this country.” She said she hoped students and others would honor the founders by learning and debating their ideas.
“Patriotic education does not mean propaganda to produce blind allegiance to the government,” McMahon said during the opening last year of PragerU’s exhibit at the White House. “The patriotism of the revolution was the opposite of blind allegiance.” 
Next to the portraits in Lincoln are short biographies with QR codes that link to artificial intelligence-generated videos from PragerU featuring the historical figures talking about their lives. 
William G. Thomas, vice president of the research division at the American Historical Association, told NPR that he has “real concerns about the extent to which they weave together words that are preserved in primary sources from historical figures with other sort of commentary.”

(Photo by Nancy Lavin/Rhode Island Current)The first day of the 2026 legislative session featured all the hallmarks of an opening celebration.
Lawmakers exchanged hugs and posed for selfies. Gun safety advocates, health care workers and lobbyists lined the State House second-floor corridors. The shrill reverberation of the 4 p.m. bell signaled legislators and onlookers to attention.
But the typically jubilant occasion was tinged with sorrow, as leaders of both chambers recognized the need for healing after a mass shooting at Brown University less than a month ago, which killed two students and injured nine more. 
“These last difficult weeks have emphasized what we all know to be true: Rhode Islanders come together in difficult times,” House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi, a Warwick Democrat, said.
Across the rotunda, Senate President Valarie Lawson, an East Providence Democrat, called for a moment of silence for the victims, university faculty and staff, health care workers, first responders and the Providence community. 
In an interview after the close of session, Lawson elaborated on the personal pain she felt as a former educator, whose own training on mass shooting preparations changed drastically over the course of her 30-year teaching career.
“What happened is tragic,” Lawson said. “When I started teaching, gun shootings wereas not a training we did.”
Dual resolutions honoring the victims and commending first responders were unanimously approved in both the chambers Tuesday.

Much like the uncertainty that gripped the state during the five-day manhunt before the shooter was identified and found dead in a New Hampshire storage facility, state lawmakers are also facing unknowns as they begin the six-month-long session. Chief among them: the fallout of federal funding cuts under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which threaten state programs and services at nearly every turn — from Medicaid and the Supplemental Assistance Nutrition Program to infrastructure projects and secondary and higher education support. 
R.I. lawmakers are back in action on Tuesday. Here’s what awaits them.

A trio of state-commissioned reports published in October offered a cursory projection of the financial and human costs for federal spending cuts, but the extent of the damage for Rhode Island has not been determined.
Despite the challenges posed by unprecedented and unpredictable actions in Washington, and a $101 million state budget deficit, Shekarchi and Lawson each pledged to protect and support the people and programs of the state.
Health care — costs and access for patients, support for hospitals and more competitive pay for primary care providers — were a shared emphasis in both leaders’ opening day remarks. Shekarchi also noted the “significant situation” around Roger Williams Medical Center and Our Lady of Fatima Hospital, which remain under threat of closure or state-appointed receivership if the prospective buyer, The Centurion Foundation, cannot finalize its purchase by Jan. 15.
“My father was a surgeon at Pawtucket Memorial Hospital, and I saw how much the surrounding communities were impacted when that hospital closed,” Shekarchi said. I do not want to see a major disruption to the already burdened health care system.”
Lawson, meanwhile, drew upon her teaching and present role as elected head of the National Education Association Rhode Island. She named expanded subsidies for child care providers to pay for their own child care — currently set to expire in 2028 — universal pre-K, a state constitutional right to education and a new workforce development center at the Community College of Rhode Island as some of her priorities for the 2026 session.
Shekarchi renewed his focus on affordable housing, touting “positive results” from the 60 new housing laws passed over the last five years under his tenure as speaker. Building permits for new housing rose 70% from 2022 to 2023, increasing again in 2024 in what marked the largest increase since the 2008 recession, Shekarchi said.

Crickets on RIPTA and a millionaire’s tax
Despite supporters making an early push for additional state funding for the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA) was not addressed in either leader’s first-day remarks. Transit advocates plan to unveil their own funding proposals for the cash-strapped bus agency Thursday afternoon. RIPTA faces a nearly $14 million budget shortfall in the next fiscal year.
The prospect of a tax on top earners, also a priority among various advocacy groups, was not mentioned on Tuesday, either. Asked directly about the policy idea in an interview after the session, Lawson reiterated the increased need for additional state revenue, potentially through a “millionaire’s tax.” Lawson has co-sponsored iterations of the bill in past legislative sessions.
Both leaders concluded their brief remarks with messages centered on collaboration and inclusion. No other policies were introduced or voted on.
“For Rhode Island’s future, let us listen to one another, learn from one another, and reaffirm our shared commitment to the shared values we cherish,” Lawson said. “No matter the challenge before us, when we work together, we can and will emerge stronger.”
The message applies especially in the Rhode Island Senate, where a series of leadership challenges over the last two years and the April 2025 death of former Senate President Dominick Ruggerio divided chamber Democrats. Lawson and Majority Leader Frank Ciccone, chosen as the new leadership team in the final two months of the 2025 session, told Rhode Island Current in December interviews that the lingering tensions had evaporated.
Sen. Alana DiMario, a Narragansett Democrat who voted against Lawson and Ciccone in a party caucus in April, seemed to agree.
“Honestly, the absolute disaster we are facing with the Trump administration is going to serve as a unifying force,” DiMario said in an interview after the session.
Sen. Jonathon Acosta, a Central Falls Democrat who last year excoriated the feuding factions within his party for placing personal politics over policy, also said he was “cautiously optimistic.
Acosta referenced a December meeting convened by Senate leadership in which more detailed policy priorities and a schedule were presented — two facets he felt were absent during the 2025 session.

The race is on 
In the House, the biggest unspoken presence hanging over the chamber is the career path of its leader. Shekarchi has been widely named as a potential candidate for the 2026 governor’s race, though he has fended off direct questions with a promise to announce a decision in the first three months of the year.
Asked on Tuesday, Shekarchi gave the same timeline for his answer.
The attorney general’s race also influenced first-day activities. Rep. Carol Hagan McEntee, a South Kingstown Democrat, formally accepted the role of chair of the House Committee on Judiciary on Tuesday. She had been informally tapped in November after the former chair, Rep. Robert Craven, a North Kingstown Democrat, was removed from the leadership role.










Honestly, the absolute disaster we are facing with the Trump administration is going to serve as a unifying force.

Craven’s fall came amid new scrutiny of decades-old domestic violence charges, brought to light during his brief run for state attorney general. He also suspended his campaign for attorney general. He intends to serve out the remainder of his term, but has already said he will not seek reelection in November.
“At a time when countless rights are being trampled upon with disregard, the House Judiciary Committee stands as a crucial line of defense for all Rhode Islanders,” McEntee said. “This is a tremendous honor.”
Committee leaders remained unchanged in the Senate. 
State lawmakers will meet biweekly on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 4 p.m.
Gov. Dan McKee is scheduled to deliver his annual State of the State address on Tuesday, Jan. 13 at 7 p.m. in the House chambers. He is expected to unveil a proposed fiscal 2026 budget in the following days.

(Photo by the Oklahoma Turnpike Authority and provided by the Oklahoma Department of Transportation)OKLAHOMA CITY – The Oklahoma Turnpike Authority on Tuesday approved spending nearly $500,000 to repair six bridges that were struck by a truck carrying an oversized load.
The agency’s governing board approved paying $491,700 to Built-Right Construction following an emergency declaration that allowed immediate repairs to be made to the six bridges over the Will Rogers Turnpike. 
The incident took place Dec. 16 on the turnpike near Claremore in Rogers and Mayes counties.
“The bridges sustained significant damage to multiple beams in the eastbound direction,” according to OTA.
Joe Echelle, OTA executive director, said the emergency repairs were completed within a week of the accident, and the bridges are now open and structurally sound.
After the bridges were struck, four were closed and two remained open, said Darian Butler, OTA engineering director.
Butler called the event “monumental,” adding that OTA officials “hadn’t seen anything quite like it.”
Butler said the agency will pursue reimbursement for the cost to repair the damages with the truck company’s insurance carrier.
“This was an illegal load,” he said, adding that the company did not get the required permit.
The driver of the 2021 Freightliner was cited for failure to have a permit, according to a citation provided to Oklahoma Voice by the state Department of Public Safety.
Service Oklahoma on Tuesday did not immediately release the collision report detailing the incident.
Oklahoma Department of Transportation Director Tim Gatz told his panel on Monday that the truck was transporting a utility pole base of some kind.
Gatz said had the company sought a permit, a suitable route could have been determined.
“This load was not routed and certainly was not observing the travel ways they should have been sticking to,” Gatz said. “The fact that they hit six of these bridges is on the inexcusable side.”
Because bridges had to be closed, disruption in local travel patterns was significant, Gatz said.

Doug Mastriano (R-Franklin) said reporting known or suspected overdoses to a central database would help first responders coordinate their responses. (Whitney Downard/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)Starting this year, emergency medical service providers are now required to report known or suspected overdoses to a statewide mapping system overseen by the Pennsylvania State Police.
It’s the result of a new law sponsored by Sen. Doug Mastriano (R-Franklin). 
The Overdose Information Network previously included reports from law enforcement, which Mastriano said excluded an estimated 80% of fatal and nonfatal overdoses where EMS responded. 
“This isn’t just data collection,” said Mastriano. “It’s about saving lives.” 
Collecting information in one place could allow first responders to identify “bad batches” of drugs, such as concoctions with higher amounts of fentanyl or other addictive compounds, Mastriano said. 
“All of us are flawed people, sinners, and we struggle with things. And sometimes people end up in the throes of addiction,” said Mastriano. “When people are stuck in addiction, we don’t want them to die in Pennsylvania. We want to try to save their lives.” 
An interactive data report from the Pennsylvania Office of Drug Surveillance and Misuse Prevention breaks down overdose data, including demographic information.
In 2023, 4,719 Pennsylvanians died from an overdose and there were 37,371 nonfatal suspected overdoses, according to the state Department of Health. Fatal overdoses dropped by 29% in 2024 to 3,341 — though the most recent state report doesn’t include a figure for nonfatal overdoses. 
Senate Bill 89, now Act 18, passed both chambers unanimously and was signed into law in June. A companion bill sponsored by Mastriano, Senate Bill 92, passed out of the Senate in April on a 33-16 vote. 
It would impose a mandatory 25-year minimum sentence on anyone who sells or distributes fentanyl that kills another person. The proposal targets dealers who might otherwise “cut deals for lenient sentencing,” as detailed in an accompanying memo. 
The measure hasn’t advanced in the House.
Mastriano left the stage after his portion of the press conference, and did not respond to questions about whether or not he would run for governor. 
He was resoundingly defeated by now-Gov. Josh Shapiro in 2022. Opponents of his campaign repeatedly highlighted Mastriano’s role in supporting President Donald Trump’s attempt to overturn the 2020 election, including his presence outside the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, when rioters stormed the building and drove Congress from its chambers to disrupt the vote certification. 
Shapiro is expected to officially launch his campaign for reelection this week. State Treasurer Stacy Garrity received the Pennsylvania GOP’s endorsement for the party’s nomination in September, but Mastriano hasn’t ruled out running again.

(Photo courtesy of the West Virginia Office of Gov. Patrick Morrisey)Gov. Patrick Morrisey is expanding his efforts to improve the state’s overburdened foster care system, announcing a plan to put programs in public schools aimed at helping children before they need the child welfare system.
There are around 6,000 children in West Virginia’s foster care system, and the state has received more than 10,000 referrals so far this year. 
“This is a very difficult area, but I do think we’re making progress, and it’s important that we continue to update people about what’s going on,” Morrisey said Tuesday at the state Capitol in Charleston, West Virginia.
In an effort to reduce the number of children coming into the foster care system, Morrisey announced that the state will expand a program known as Star Academy. It’s a school-within-a-school model designed to help at-risk middle school students. 
The program, built on site at current schools, provides classroom instruction along with an academic recovery program to help students catch up. 
“I think it’s going to help kids, keep kids engaged in school and reduce some of the risks that lead to foster care involvement,” Morrisey said. 
His administration plans to open eight new Star Academy sites in the state.
Alex Mayer, secretary of the West Virginia Department of Human Services, said it was a good step in establishing primary prevention in the state. 
“I think prevention is a key part, though, to the overall success and reform in child welfare,” he said. “So while it’s not, I think, the only thing we have to be focusing on, it’s a key part in the reforms that we’re going to be putting in place and moving forward with here in West Virginia.”
Morrisey will use unspent federal Temporary Assistance for Need Families dollars to pay for the $8 million project, and he’ll need lawmakers to approve some changes to allow the expansion. States have discretion about how they use TANF, a federal emergency relief program, and it can be used to pay for a wide range of programs.
The program can serve up to 80 students per year and generally operate on a three to five year cycle. Morrisey that could allow the programs to serve up to 240 to 400 students per school. 
Star Academy has been piloted in four areas — Charleston, Logan, Martinsburg and Philippi. Results from West Virginia’s four pilot programs show an 81% decrease in behavioral incidents and a 63% increase in attendance. 
“We’re seeing that they’re already producing some strong results in math and English scores. But it’s on the behavioral side that we’re really encouraged,” Morrisey said.
West Virginia recently enacted a new school discipline law outlining how teachers can respond to violent and threatening behavior in the classroom following increased student discipline issues. 
Educators have linked worsening behavioral issues in schools to the state’s ongoing substance abuse crisis; behavioral issues can be because of abuse and neglect or a result of neonatal abstinence syndrome, they said. 
Fewer than half of the state’s 55 counties have alternate learning centers for children with behavioral issues.
No planned changes for homeschool students 
The Star Academy will serve students in public schools, and Morrisey said he wasn’t interested in “a whole new regulatory scheme” for parents who are homeschooling their children. 
The number of homeschool children in the state is growing. 
Previous Gov. Jim Justice and some Republicans previously floated the idea of tightening homeschool students’ reporting requirements after 14-year-old Kyneddi Miller, a homeschool student, died in 2024 from apparent starvation in Boone County. The girl’s mother hadn’t turned in the required homeschool assessments to the local school district that could have prompted someone to check in on the child. 
The Senate last year declined to take up a bill that would paused a parent’s request to homeschool if there’s a pending child abuse investigation against the parent. The measure was named “Raylee’s Law” for an eight-year-old girl who died of abuse and neglect in 2018 after her parents withdrew her from school. Educators at her elementary school had notified Child Protective Services of potential abuse. 
In response to a question from WOWK reporter Maddy Sperling, the governor said he trusted parents to take care of their children.
“I think it’s important that our kids are always brought up in the best and proper environments, and if there are complaints, they’re made, they’re all going to get addressed,” he said. 
Morrisey has announced several foster care reform efforts since taking office last year and recently unveiled a plan to bring 380 foster children in out-of-state institutions back to West Virginia. Foster children are in facilities in states including California, Texas, Utah and Washington, according to DoHS data.
The governor said he’ll request $6 million in state funding for a new fund aimed at renovating current state-owned buildings with the goal of opening beds for foster children who need acute mental and behavioral health services. 
The 60-day legislative session begins Wednesday, Jan. 14. Morrisey will deliver his second State of the State address that evening.

Kyle Howe resigned from City of Toledo’s police force in 2023 when city officials publicly condemned him for what they alleged were multiple instances of excessive force. Howe’s resignation came in the midst of an internal investigation that involved a review of various body-camera videos involving several individuals he had arrested.
At the time, City Attorney Michael Marquess said city officials were “shocked and dismayed by Mr. Howe’s abhorrent behavior in what we believe to be several instances of unnecessary force.”
In September 2023, two separate lawsuits were filed against Howe and the City of Toledo in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa, each alleging false arrest, assault, battery, negligent supervision and civil rights violations. That was followed by similar lawsuits filed by other citizens in November 2023, February 2024 and May 2024. A sixth lawsuit was filed in February 2025.
Court records indicate that of the six lawsuits, one resulted in a jury finding in favor of Howe, one resulted in a summary judgment in favor of Howe, one resulted in an out-of-court settlement and three resulted in a dismissal that may or may not have involved a settlement.
In February 2024, the Iowa Law Enforcement Academy initiated its efforts to suspend or revoke Howe’s certification. In December 2025, a final decision was made to suspend Howe’s certification for three years. By suing the academy, Howe is now seeking judicial review of that decision.
Arrest triggers investigation, resignation
According to Howe’s court petition, he graduated from the Iowa Law Enforcement Academy in October 2017 and was hired a few weeks later by the State Center Police Department. In August 2018, he was hired by the Toledo Police Department.
Court records indicate the City of Toledo promoted Howe to the position of sergeant in November 2022 and bestowed several awards and accommodations on him during his years with the department. According to the records, Howe received no formal field training or training in report writing or conflict de-escalation while working for the city.
On March 30, 2023, Howe conducted a traffic stop and arrested Shyla Wolf, who later complained to the police chief that she was mistreated by Howe. On April 7, 2023, the city opened a formal investigation into the matter and one week later Howe was placed on administrative leave.
On April 23, 2023, Howe resigned. The next day, the city’s hired investigator, Jon Thomas, presented the preliminary report on his investigation to the city, which publicly condemned Howe’s conduct while stating it did not rise to the level of excessive force.
Around that time, Howe was the focus of a KCRG-TV report that included body-camera footage of him physically restraining Wolf, who was suspected of driving while barred.
The Tama Toledo News Chronicle subsequently posted to its YouTube channel a series of videos from traffic stops conducted by Howe, some which show Howe pushing people to the ground and yelling, seemingly without provocation, “Stop resisting!”
On Feb. 15, 2024, the Iowa Law Enforcement Academy initiated efforts to decertify Howe as an Iowa peace officer.
Howe, meanwhile, had taken a job with the Polk County Juvenile Detention Center where he worked as a youth service worker. He later was hired as a youth counselor for the state-run Iowa State Training School in Eldora.
Report: Howe lacked the ‘cognitive capacity’ to recall arrest details
State records show Howe contested the academy’s efforts to suspend or revoke his certification, which led to a two-day hearing in April 2025 before Administrative Law Judge Denise Timmins.
At the hearing, Thomas served as the state’s expert witness and indicated he had reviewed several arrests by Howe and although he found no use of excessive force, he did conclude Howe had problems “overall (with) some poor decision making” related to documentation, report writing, and inappropriate language.
Thomas found that Howe’s tone of voice, his choice of words, and his use of profanities were unprofessional and helped create what he characterized as “a public perception of excessive force.” Howe, Thomas said, had demonstrated a pattern of conduct in which he “just did not attempt to de-escalate or bring down the temperature of the conversation” with arrestees.
In his investigative report for the City of Toledo, Thomas stated that while Howe’s written arrest reports  may have conflicted with what could be seen on video of those arrests, Howe “did not have the cognitive capacity to accurately recall” all of the details of those arrests when writing his reports.
Judge: Howe ‘lacked judgment and discipline’
While lawyers for the academy argued that Howe, by providing false information in his reports, had committed serious misconduct warranting the revocation of his certification, Timmins found that Howe was, at most, “careless in his report writing.”
Timmins also found that while Howe had claimed in his reports to have “assisted” — rather than forced — arrestees to the ground, such language doesn’t represent a false statement but is instead a “poor choice of words” that reflects the actual language Howe and other police officers throughout the nation are specifically trained to use in their reports.
“If one were to watch the videos without having any other context or evidence to supplement what is observed, the immediate emotional reaction is alarm and dismay over the actions taken and words said by (Howe),” Timmins wrote in her decision “However, in legal proceedings, emotions cannot replace evidence.”
As to whether Howe committed a lower level of misconduct that could result in the suspension of his certification, Timmins sided with the state.
Timmins wrote that Howe’s “tone of voice, his aggressive stance, the consistency of his desire to take subjects to the ground, his choice of words used during his interactions, and his overall lack of empathy and respect when dealing with another human being that he has authority over, all fall well below the current standards of the profession … Just as important, this conduct occurred over an extended period of time with multiple instances.”
She added that during Howe’s “tenure with the Toledo Police Department, he was rough around the edges,” and “lacked judgment and discipline of emotions when others around him challenged his authority.” She stated that while “none of these actions are ideal in a law enforcement officer,” they are traits that “can change with age, maturity and proper training.”

According to a statement shared to social media, Romulus Police responded to a report of an active shooter at 9:53 a.m. after school employees instituted a lockdown upon seeing a man with a handgun attempting to enter the school’s main doors. There were reports of shots fired. 
Officers apprehended the man near the main entrance and recovered a handgun at the scene. An investigation into the suspect’s motives or intentions remains ongoing, with the department advising anyone with information related to the incident to contact Detective Sergeant Jason Otter at 734-942-6857. Callers may remain anonymous.
There is no ongoing threat to the school or the community, the department said, commending the school employees for “their quick recognition of danger and immediate notification to 911.” 
“Their professional and timely actions may have prevented this incident from becoming much worse,” the department wrote in a statement. 
State Sen. Darrin Camilleri (D-Trenton), whose district includes Romulus, issued a statement Tuesday afternoon, noting that he’d been briefed on the matter by local leaders including Romulus School Board President Porsche Laster and Mayor Robert McCraight.
“I’m extremely grateful that our school staff and first responders were able to ensure that all students and staff remained safe during this frightening moment,” Camilleri said. “Every safety system worked today, and we avoided any potential tragedy.

The Vermont Senate Ethics Panel dismissed two complaints against Sens. Seth Bongartz, D-Bennington, and Scott Beck, R-Caledonia, and found their conduct was not unethical under the state’s Senate rules.
The complaints were filed over the summer, after lawmakers worked overtime to craft the final form of a wide-ranging education bill, now called Act 73.
The ethics complaints allege the senators advocated for private schools they are associated with. Beck, the Senate minority leader, is employed as a teacher at St. Johnsbury Academy, while Bongartz, the chair of the Senate Education Committee, served almost two decades on the board of Burr and Burton Academy.

Bongartz and Beck both held critical positions on a conference committee charged with reconciling differences in the House and Senate versions of education reform legislation.
The Legislature passed the bill June 16 and Gov. Phil Scott signed the bill into law on July 1.
One complaint, filed by Friends of Vermont Public Education board member Geo Honigford, alleged that the two senators violated ethical standards by negotiating the reform bill and used their positions to advance provisions benefiting the private schools.
Among its many components, the bill set new limits on which independent schools would remain eligible to receive public funding in the future and how much they would be able to charge.
The other complaint, filed on July 9 by Essex-Westford school board Chair Robert Carpenter, alleged ethical violations against Beck specifically.
Carpenter, in his complaint, said he was “alarmed at the conflicts of interests we watch unfold at the state level,” and asked why Beck did not recuse himself from education reform negotiations.
Carpenter attached correspondence his board had with Beck during the state’s implementation of Act 127, a law that tweaked the state’s education finance formula. In the exchange, Carpenter asked Beck whether it was “the will of the legislature and the governor to scale back public education in Vermont?,” to which Beck replied “yes.”
In the Senate Ethics Panel letters dismissing the complaints, panel member Sen. Kesha Ram Hinsdale, D-Chittenden Southeast, wrote that the panel “did not find probable cause an ethical violation occurred” under Senate rules.
Senate Ethics Panel correspondence typically remains confidential but in this case was shared with VTDigger. The panel’s dismissal of the complaints was first reported by Seven Days.
In correspondence with Carpenter, Hinsdale wrote that Beck’s employment as a teacher “was no secret” at the time of his election. She wrote that he has been employed with St. Johnsbury Academy longer than he’s been a senator.
“To issue an ethical violation to a Senator solely for being an employee/member of a class, known to voters prior to his election in the body, may create constitutional challenges and undermine the sovereignty of the electorate,” Hinsdale wrote.
Bongartz said in an interview the complaint against him was “vacuous” and said he “knew from day one” it would be dismissed.
“I never lost a moment’s sleep over it,” he said. “There was absolutely nothing there.”
He called the complaint “an attempt to weaponize the ethics process, which is unfortunate.”
Beck also said he had not given the complaints much thought.
“My job in here is to represent my towns, the schools in my districts, the students in my district, and that’s what I do, and if somebody from a faraway district doesn’t want me to do that then, I’m not gonna not do what I’m supposed to do,” he said. “I’m gonna do my job.”
Honigford said he was not surprised by the panel’s dismissal. “I knew they were going to dismiss it before I even filed it,” he said.
“You basically have to get caught with your hand in a cookie jar,” he said. “And aside from that, there’s really nothing you can do to be unethical in Vermont.”
Carpenter in an interview suggested that school boards are held to higher standards than sitting senators are.
“I did believe that ethics were not being followed, and that there was private interest involved,” he said. “At the local school board level that would have zero tolerance whatsoever — our constituents would vote us out of office instantly.”
A third complaint against Beck, meanwhile, remains in process. Filed by Danville School District’s board Chair Clayton Cargill, the complaint alleges Beck “used his position and legislative influence to advance a narrative and push” the district to close high school grades at the Danville School to benefit St. Johnsbury Academy.
Beck similarly dismissed that complaint. Cargill said he has not heard back yet from the Senate Ethics Panel.
Statehouse Bureau Chief Ethan Weinstein contributed reporting.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa lawmakers meeting Tuesday said they recognized the need for expanding access to subacute mental health services in Iowa — but said there are no specific plans on how to tackle the issue yet.
The Subacute Mental Health Care Services Interim Study Committee met Tuesday, the week before the 2026 legislative session is set to kick off, to discuss concerns and issues with certain services in Iowa’s mental health system. Subacute mental health programs are for people who do not need emergency hospitalization but need more intensive support than is available through outpatient care — a type of care that Iowans and officials said was extremely limited and difficult to access in the state.
Mary Neubauer, a former spokesperson for the Iowa Lottery, said her family had extensive experience in seeking subacute mental health care system as they pursued care for their son, Sergei, who died by suicide in 2017. Sergei, who was adopted by Neubauer and her husband in 2009, struggled with major depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder after going through an abusive childhood in Russia.  Neubauer said their family knew he would need “more support” as he transitioned to life in the U.S., but that after his second inpatient psychiatric care hospitalization, “it was obvious he would need longer-term care if he were to have a chance to regain his health.”
When Neubauer and her husband asked the psychiatrist treating their son where they could find such care, she said “the doctor’s answer was that there were great subacute care programs out there, but he did not know of any in Iowa, and we would have to find them.”
“I do not denigrate that doctor,” Neubauer said. “He was doing the best he could in the state with few resources at the time, but for us as parents who were so scared and stressed, that answer was devastating.”
After extensive research, Neubauer said, her family found two subacute mental health treatment centers that they believed would be a good fit for Sergei, located in Arizona and Wisconsin. Sergei received care in the Arizona treatment program for five weeks, and then went on for three months of “step-down care” in California.
After completing these programs, he returned to Iowa. While he appeared to be doing well in his first weeks home, Neubauer said, he eventually committed suicide in September 2017.
“I don’t know if Sergei’s story would have been different, would have had a different outcome if more mental health treatment options would have been available for him here in Iowa,” Neubauer said. “But I do know that his journey to regain his health was made that much harder by having to go halfway across the country to receive that care, and it made our journey as his parents trying to support him absolutely excruciating. If we can keep another family from having that experience, we will have done something good.”
The committee members heard from officials with the Iowa departments of Health and Human Services and Inspections, Appeals, and Licensing about why there was a dearth of subacute mental health programs in Iowa.
One of the major difficulties identified in Iowa’s current oversight of these subacute mental health care was a provision in Iowa Code stating these services “shall be limited to a period not to exceed ten calendar days or another time period determined in accordance with rules adopted by the department for this purpose, whichever is longer.”
Sara Throener, legislative liaison for DIAL, said the 10 days marked in this section was not meant to be a hard limit for receiving subacute mental health services, but a period for receiving “rolling assessment” on the patient’s condition. While there is the ability to provide longer care, Throener said it is possible the 10-day language is “misconstrued by payment providers or by providers thinking that’s all that they can offer.”
Neubauer said as their family looked at treatment options for their son, subacute mental health treatment programs typically ranged from six weeks to three months in length.
The perceived 10-day limit was also brought up by providers in a Request for Information from Iowa HHS, according to Cory Turner, HHS division administrator for state-operated specialty care.
“It’s not a fault of the rules or HHS at the time, it’s just the way in which it’s written and the way in which it’s interpreted, providers see it as a detriment,” Turner said. “… It doesn’t ensure that there’s viability in their business model. If you have a 10-day limit on someone, and that 10th day comes and goes, the individual may already be discharged by the time they receive payment, or they may not get payment for services at all.”
Turner said these issues on time limits may be part of why Iowa’s currently available subacute mental health care provisions are being underutilized. There are currently at least 30 beds at six health care providers in Iowa that provide this treatment, according to HHS data — but Turner said in one RFI response, a provider said of the 16 beds available in their program, only two were being used.
Other issues were funding and reimbursement streams for these programs, he said, as well as difficulties recruiting qualified staff.
Turner said investing more in subacute programs could help lessen the burden on other parts of Iowa’s mental health care system. At several of Iowa’s mental health care institutes, he said, there are significant numbers of patients “in the facilities for longer lengths of stay than are necessary.” He said some of these individuals likely would benefit from moving from an emergency, acute level of care to a subacute treatment program, that would help “unkink” the system and free up resources for others in crisis.
There are also other rules, like higher professional requirements for practitioners in subacute facilities than in crisis facilities, as well as lower limits on how many patients at a time can be cared for in these programs, that officials said make it less economically viable for health care providers to offer these services in Iowa.
Though the committee discussed several issues, the panel did not move forward with any suggestions at the meeting. Rep. Gary Mohr, R-Bettendorf, who co-chaired the committee, said “it sounds like there is sufficient interest that we are going to move something forward.” However, he said any potential legislation on this issue is far from finalized.
“Many of you are going to think as a result of today, we’re going to come out with a grandiose, multimillion-dollar plan — don’t count on it,” Mohr said. “Some of you expect us to come out with virtually nothing, and maybe one or two recommendations — don’t count on it. We’re going to get as far as we can moving this issue forward, based on the knowledge we have now and the questions we still have yet to ask. But it’s an issue that seems to be important, and we will move this forward through our committee structure probably, the Legislature — again, you know how things work here, there’s no definite path for it.”

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)As Utah adds more titles to its banned book list, three award-winning authors and two high school students are suing the state, the board of education and three school districts over what they describe as “the freedom to read.”
In a lawsuit filed Tuesday with the American Civil Liberties Union of Utah, authors Elana K. Arnold, Ellen Hopkins and Amy Reed, the Kurt Vonnegut Estate, and two anonymous students challenged Utah’s “sensitive materials” law that the Legislature expanded in 2024, making it easier to prohibit “criminally indecent or pornographic” books from public schools statewide.
“The right to read and the right to free speech are inseparable. The First Amendment protects our freedom to read, learn, and share ideas free from unconstitutional censorship,” Tom Ford, attorney at the ACLU of Utah said in a statement. “This law censors constitutionally protected books, silences authors, and denies students access to ideas, in violation of the First Amendment rights of students and authors alike, and must be struck down.”

Plaintiffs are asking a 3rd District judge to rule the state’s book bans as unconstitutional under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, since, they say, they constitute “blatant violations of the free speech rights of students and authors alike.”
The Utah State Board of Education has a list of 22 titles that at least three school districts have reported to contain “objective sensitive materials,” which the law defines as “pornographic or indecent.” And, hundreds of books have also been removed from individual school libraries in the state.
Arnold is the author of “What Girls are Made of” and “Damsel,” and Ellen Hopkins is the author of “Tilt,” “Fallout” and “Tricks,” all books that have been prohibited from public school libraries all over the state. Other individual libraries have banned works including Vonnegut’s “Slaughterhouse-Five” and Toni Morrison’s “The Bluest Eye.” 
The Utah State Board of Education said in a Tuesday statement that it is aware of the lawsuit and cannot comment on specifics of ongoing litigation.
“We remain committed to fulfilling our responsibilities under state law and supporting local education agencies in serving Utah students,” the board wrote. “The Board will respond through the appropriate legal channels.”



Let us know what you think...


 


In the lawsuit, plaintiffs criticized that the book ban applies to “any book that contains even a single description or depiction of sex, no matter how fleeting, no matter its context, and no matter its literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.” 
One of the student plaintiffs said in an ACLU news release that making books disappear sends “a clear message about whose stories matter and whose do not.”
“Book bans do more harm than simply removing stories. Empty shelves cost us understanding and connection, turning schools from places of learning into systems of control,” the student said. “Censorship does not just make ideas disappear, but also makes schools more confusing and dangerous because of its chilling effect on our right to learn.”
The suit also rejects a lack of distinction between kindergartners and 12th graders in the rule.
“This creates an absurd mismatch with other parts of Utah’s own legal standards. State law permits sixteen-year-olds to consent to certain sexual activity,” the lawsuit reads. “Yet the same students whom Utah trusts to make intimate, real-world decisions about their bodies are, under the Book Removal Law, barred from accessing out books that contain a mere single passage describing the very conduct in which is lawful for them to engage.”  
Plaintiffs say no one disputes that pornography and obscene material should be excluded from school libraries. However, statewide bans have gone further than what the U.S. Constitution allows, according to the lawsuit. The Constitution protects books from removal if they “have value as a whole” under the Miller-for-minors standard.

MONTPELIER — House Speaker Jill Krowiniski had some less-than-cheery opening remarks to her colleagues to kick off the 2026 Vermont legislative session.
“Let’s be honest, last year was tough, and anyone who tells you otherwise didn’t sit where you are and confront the decisions that came before us in this chamber,” the Burlington Democrat said.
Last year, lawmakers worked into June — well past their more typical May adjournment — to hammer out the details of Act 73, the year’s landmark education reform package. Despite the marathon work of 2025, this year is expected to require similar fortitude, as lawmakers determine how and if to consolidate school districts, and whether to restrict school spending to limit property tax increases.

To complicate matters, lawmakers are eyeing the onslaught of federal funding cuts, and the Legislature’s budget writers have warned their colleagues that 2026 will require agonizing spending decisions. 
The start of the second year in the biennium, Tuesday began at a fast pace. Over 60 bills were introduced on the House floor, and almost as many moved in the Senate. And with numerous new lawmakers in both chambers, leadership appointed incoming representatives and senators to their legislative committees. 
In no surprise, Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Baruth, D/P-Chittenden Central, told his upper chamber colleagues that education would be the year’s big topic. He said he expected to release a bill this week that would seek to limit the growth of school district spending for two years while Act 73’s other reforms play out.
Gov. Phil Scott welcomed the Legislature back to Montpelier in a statement reflecting on the fifth anniversary of Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riots.
“It’s an important reminder that fear, anger, and deeply held beliefs can be manipulated and elevated to the point of destruction and violence,” he said. “It’s also a reminder that our democracy depends on respect for the rule of law, peaceful political disagreement, and the integrity and accountability of the institutions created to serve the people.”
The anniversary accompanied looming changes in Vermont’s capital. The session launched with enhanced security. All visitors were directed to a single point of entry rather than the usual multiple doors, and police checked bags with X-rays, as was sometimes the case last year. 
Baruth indicated in his introductory remarks that these precautions may become more regular, and that Capitol Police have been working to “beef up” security.  
“We mean to go there full time at some point,” he said of the single point of entry. “This particular session you will see that on and off as we get accustomed to it.”

We’ve put everything you need to engage with statehouse lawmaking in one story, with links. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Your starter kit for the 2026 Vermont legislative session.","Every year, for roughly five months, the Vermont Legislature takes up the people’s business, debating policies and passing laws that impact all aspects of Vermonters’ lives.
As part of our annual Legislative Guide, we’ve gathered the essential information to follow along, with links to deeper explainers and tools you can use all session.
No matter where in Vermont you live, you have at least one person representing you in each chamber of the Legislature — the House and the Senate. You can find out who they are and how to contact them in the state’s legislative directory, or learn about other ways to contact them directly at the Statehouse. 
Lawmakers in each body are elected every two years. Those two years are considered one biennial session, though each annual lawmaking period is also described as a session.
You can watch representatives and senators work in real time. Anyone can show up at the statehouse, at 115 State St. in Montpelier. Plus, the Vermont General Assembly — what we usually just call “the Legislature” — livestreams most of its activity on YouTube. That includes debate and votes in both chambers. Since the Covid-19 era, the offerings have also included committee meetings where lawmakers craft and vet bills in specific policy areas. 
Each committee has its own YouTube channel. New streams begin every time the body convenes, and videos are saved on the channel for later viewing.
The House and Senate calendars, posted daily on the Legislature’s homepage, list the bills and other items that each chamber plans to take up. You can also read about what’s happening in Final Reading, our daily Statehouse newsletter. 
Who runs things?
To be a good observer, you need to know who’s in charge. There are a number of key roles in the Vermont Legislature. 
The most powerful individual in the statehouse, at least on paper, is the speaker of the House. That person has abilities that, in the Senate, are distributed among several officials. Specifically, the speaker sets the agenda for the chamber and is responsible for moderating the action on the floor. She also makes committee assignments and assigns committee chairs.  
Unlike the House, the Senate does not choose its presiding officer. The people do that, when they vote for lieutenant governor. But while the lieutenant governor technically runs Senate meetings, the president pro tempore (often referred to as the “pro tem”) does so in practice. 
In the Senate, committee chairs and members are appointed by a three-member Committee on Committees, which includes the lieutenant governor, the pro tem and the so-called third member. That last person is selected by a vote of all 30 senators at the start of the biennium. 
Each political party in the House and Senate selects one member in each chamber to serve as its leader. The parties also generally elect an assistant or deputy leader — sometimes known as the “whip” — to help enforce priorities and count votes before a bill reaches the floor. 
Two offices carry the institutional knowledge of the House and Senate: the clerk of the House and the secretary of the Senate. As chief parliamentarians, they ensure that each chamber’s rules are followed by lawmakers. And as the chambers’ chief administrative officers, they keep the building running. 
Read about these leaders and other supporting officers in the Legislature here. 
What do they do? 
One of the primary jobs of the Legislature is to create and adjust the laws of the state by approving bills. 
A bill becomes a law if a majority of the members in both chambers — the House and the Senate — vote to approve it, and the governor signs it. Simple, right?
Not quite. There are lots of ways a bill can die before it reaches the governor’s desk — and even then, the governor has a few options for how to treat legislation that’s been passed by the House and Senate. Only bills that clear all the potential hurdles become state laws.
Here’s a more detailed look at the process.
Another key role for the Legislature is to approve government spending and taxation. That involves voting on annual budget bills, tax bills and bills involving infrastructure investments. Typically, though not necessarily, these bills are developed with the input and approval of the governor. The executive branch is then charged with raising and spending the money necessary to keep the state running, and it has a certain amount of discretion to determine where that money goes. 
There is, of course, a longer answer.

El déficit de California está creciendo, la incertidumbre se cierne sobre el estado y los líderes estatales pueden tener menos opciones que antes para hacerle frente.


This article is also available in English. Read it here.
El gobernador Gavin Newsom abrió el 2025 con un pronóstico optimista : impulsado por $17 mil millones más en ingresos de lo planeado previamente, el estado tendría un modesto superávit de $363 millones para el año fiscal 2025-26, dijo a los periodistas en enero.
 Pero la vida da un giro repentino.
Los incendios forestales de enero que arrasaron Los Ángeles obligaron al estado a gastar miles de millones de dólares en ayuda por desastres y a retrasar la declaración de impuestos de los residentes de Los Ángeles. El costo de Medi-Cal, el programa estatal de seguro médico para residentes de bajos ingresos, se disparó 6 mil millones de dólares más de lo previsto. Las políticas arancelarias intermitentes del presidente Donald Trump sacudieron la bolsa de valores , de la que California depende en gran medida para obtener ingresos fiscales. Además, el estado presentó una serie de demandas contra la administración Trump por su amenaza de retener fondos federales para asistencia alimentaria, recuperación ante desastres y otras subvenciones.
 En mayo, Newsom ya no predijo un superávit modesto, sino un déficit de 12 mil millones de dólares.
Para tapar el hueco, Newsom inicialmente propuso recortes drásticos a Medi-Cal. Pero el presupuesto final que negoció con los legisladores estatales dependió en gran medida del endeudamiento interno, utilizando las reservas estatales y congelando la inscripción a Medi-Cal para inmigrantes indocumentados para evitar recortes profundos a otros servicios sociales.
 Si bien los líderes demócratas culparon en gran medida a la administración Trump del problema presupuestario de California, la volatilidad de los ingresos estatales no es nueva. California depende en gran medida de la tributación de los ingresos y las ganancias de capital de las personas con altos ingresos, cuya fortuna a menudo depende de la bolsa. En 2022, el estado registró un superávit de casi 100 000 millones de dólares, seguido de un déficit proyectado de 56 000 millones de dólares durante los próximos dos años.
 Perspectivas para 2026
 Se proyecta que el déficit alcance casi 18 mil millones de dólares el próximo año, principalmente porque se espera que el estado gaste tanto dinero que compensaría, si no eclipsaría, los fuertes ingresos fiscales impulsados por un auge de la IA, dijo la Oficina del Analista Legislativo no partidista en su perspectiva fiscal el mes pasado.
 Si la estimación se mantiene, será el cuarto año consecutivo durante el mandato de Newsom que California enfrenta un déficit a pesar del crecimiento de los ingresos.
 Peor aún, el déficit estructural podría alcanzar los 35.000 millones de dólares anuales para el año fiscal 2027-28, afirmó la LAO.
 California se enfrenta a un gasto adicional de 6 mil millones de dólares el próximo año, incluyendo al menos 1300 millones de dólares porque el estado ahora debe pagar más para cubrir los beneficios de Medi-Cal según el proyecto de ley presupuestaria de Trump. El estado también podría perder más fondos del gobierno federal para la vivienda y las personas sin hogar.
 ¿Cómo pueden los legisladores solucionarlo? Las opciones son limitadas, ya que el estado ya tomó medidas puntuales para equilibrar las cuentas. La LAO señala que resolver un problema presupuestario estructural persistente requiere encontrar fuentes de ingresos más sostenibles, realizar recortes drásticos, o ambas cosas.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/051425_Newsom-May-Budget_FG_CM_03.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-06 16:58:32.153249

(Photo courtesy of University of Iowa)The University of Iowa is working to upgrade equipment and expand its materials science learning capabilities for students and researchers across Iowa with the support of a grant from the U.S. Department of Defense.
The university announced it has received a nearly $1.5 million grant to study potential combinations of different materials to develop “light- or electronic-based quantum systems,” according to a news release.
Titled “Heterogeneous Nanoscale Materials Collaborative for Quantum Technologies at The University of Iowa,” the grant-funded initiative will bring together researchers in physics, chemistry and engineering and allow for the purchase of new equipment to better study materials at sub-microscopic levels and manipulate them for combination.

“We want to utilize the quantum mechanical properties of new materials,” said Ravitej Uppu, assistant professor in the UI physics and astronomy department and a principal investigator on the award, in the release. “If we can harness these new materials, functionalize them, then we could make sensors that can achieve better image quality and better sensing performance.”
The UI Materials Analysis, Testing and Fabrication Facility will act as the project’s base and will see its equipment and infrastructure updated through the grant, facility director Tori Forbes said in the release.
New equipment will have etching and pattern-creation capabilities, the release stated, and a new printing system will be able to layer materials “to optimize their optical and electronic properties.” Uppu said in the release the technology will help researchers potentially turn “conceptual structures into working devices” and fabricate “everything from light-routing devices to tiny transistors relevant for quantum technologies in a university research setting.”
“It’s been challenging to keep this aging equipment functional and enable faculty and students to conduct research in this area,” Forbes said in the release. “This award will ensure that students can receive training on state-of-the-art equipment and faculty can continue to innovate.”
Just under 30 academic teams received grants from the Department of Defense this fall through its Defense Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research, or DEPSCoR. More than $19 million was awarded, with both the UI and Boise State University selected for funding up to $1.5 million over two years and the rest receiving up to $600,000 over three years.
According to the release, students and faculty from other Iowa colleges and universities will have access to the work and opportunities afforded by the Materials Analysis, Testing and Fabrication Facility and the grant. Uppu said in the release the team plans to run a summer school program for students from regional colleges interested in learning to use the new equipment.
“That way, we create a new bridge between the universities to start thinking about potential collaborative projects. And naturally, MATFab becomes the central hub for that, because it hosts all the required facilities,” he said in the release.

(Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)Environmentalists are cheering after a New Jersey appellate court upheld controversial new state environmental regulations and rejected a challenge from scrap recyclers and a labor union that alleged regulators had acted arbitrarily and exceeded their statutory authority.
The court’s Monday decision will keep in place, for now, the landmark New Jersey law that requires additional environmental reviews for projects in overburdened communities and allows the Department of Environmental Protection to block those projects if they would disproportionally worsen public health there.
“Today’s decision was a win for all New Jersey residents, but primarily for the environmental justice communities that have long championed this fight. When our environmental laws protect our most vulnerable communities, they protect us all,” said Casandia Bellevue, an attorney with Earthjustice, which represented supporters of the law.
Plastic pellets known as ‘nurdles’ are polluting beaches and waterways

Some business groups lamented the decision. Ray Cantor, deputy chief government affairs officer for the New Jersey Business and Industry Association, said the environmental rules “have had, and will continue to have, a chilling effect on New Jersey’s business community.”

The 2020 Environmental Justice Law requires state environmental regulators to reject permit applications for facilities like gas power and waste treatment plants that produce significant contaminants in communities where at least 35% of residents are low-income (or 40% are non-white or have limited English proficiency) if they fail to pass a public-interest balancing test.

The law is meant to limit further contamination in parts of New Jersey that historically saw significant pollution during the state’s industrial era, though provisions allow some projects to continue based on public need or mitigation technology approved by regulators.
The public-interest balancing test does not consider whether a project’s economic activity could be used to overcome disproportionate health impacts. The New Jersey branch of the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries and the Engineers Labor Employer Cooperative Local 825 argued that excluding economic gains from the test is impermissibly arbitrary because a better economy could boost education and employment levels, reducing public health stressors.
But the court agreed with state officials who said economic benefits are difficult to quantify while reviewing a project’s application, adding that they cannot enforce promises of economic growth.
Though other New Jersey environmental laws balanced economic growth against public or environmental health, the Environmental Justice Law did not, the three-judge panel found.
“It is clear from the Legislature’s intent in [the Environmental Justice Law] that it requires prioritizing the health, safety, and environmental needs of the individuals in [overburdened communities] and that neither DEP nor applicants for approvals are allowed to trade fewer pollution reductions for more jobs and tax ratables,” Judge Heidi Currier wrote for the panel.
New Jersey marks all or part of 341 municipalities covering more than 5.2 million residents as overburdened communities, according to data maintained by the Department of Environmental Protection.
Those include portions of cities — swathes of Newark and Atlantic City, for example — but they also include parts of wealthier suburbs like Voorhees, where significant percentages of residents in a given census block are low-income, are non-white, or speak limited English.
The court rejected the plaintiffs’ other challenges for similar reasons. Rules requiring reviews for expansions at existing facilities — including ones that do not alter a facility’s physical footprint — are not overbroad because those expansions could still strain public health, the court said.
Rules requiring additional environmental reviews in census blocks with zero residents bordering overburdened communities are likewise permissible because pollution generated there could flow to areas covered by the law.
Regulations requiring air pollution controls at some sites are also permissible, the judges ruled. Scrap recyclers and the union had charged that those provisions conflict with the Air Pollution Control Act and are impermissibly vague.
The court also rejected plaintiffs’ claims that the department violated the Administrative Procedures Act by failing to provide meaningful analysis of the rules’ impact on jobs and the economy, arguing its impact reports were “devoid of meaningful analysis or information.”
The department had released all required economic impact statements alongside the rule proposal, the judges said, adding the law does not require the department to make a more fulsome analysis of how the rule might affect New Jersey’s economy.
“Neither the rule nor the APA require an agency to provide specific cost information or quantify the expected costs and revenues generated or lost. ‘All that is required is for the agency to describe the expected economic impact,’” Currier wrote, citing an earlier case.
Dennis Toft, who represented the engineers union, expressed disappointment in the ruling.
“We’re disappointed that the appellate division deferred completely to DEP when circumstances where it was admitted by the DEP that the legislation had gaps in it that DEP, on its own, decided to fill those gaps without pointing them out and going back and having the robust legislative debate that would’ve been called for,” he said.
He said it is too early to say whether his clients would petition the New Jersey Supreme Court for an appeal. An attorney for the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries did not immediately return a request for comment.

Anna Paulina Luna with Gov. Ron DeSantis in Clearwater on Jan 6, 2025. (Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)CLEARWATER — Pinellas County Republican U.S. Rep. Anna Paulina Luna’s push for a congressional stock trading ban received an endorsement Tuesday from Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.
Saying members from both major parties have unfairly boosted their personal financial fortunes based on information they learn while serving in Congress, the governor added that every member of the state’s 28-member congressional delegation should support the legislation when it comes to a vote in the House later this year.
And he said he will advocate for a state law to require all candidates running for federal office in Florida to check a form about whether they intend to trade individual stocks while serving.
“It’s really odd,” he said while speaking at a press conference held at the U.S. Coast Guard Air Station in Clearwater.
“You’ll have people get elected to Congress having never shown any investment acumen ever in their life, and then all of a sudden they become Warren Buffet on steroids. They’re putting some of the biggest hedge funds in America to shame with these stock trades that have these really suspicious timings. Because, look, if you buy a stock and it goes up 400% in like a month? That’s like a once in a lifetime investment, and yet these guys seem to be doing this quite frequently. And they have access to certain information I believe that is helping to fuel that.”
Public opinion polls have shown for several years that banning stock-trading in individual companies by members of Congress is popular.
Portfolios increase
Republicans from across the country have made former Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi the symbol of how members of Congress have become exponentially wealthier during their time in Washington. Over the past three years, Pelosi reported a trade volume of more than $50 million, according to Capital Trades, a website that monitors the stock activity of members of Congress.
However, according to the government watchdog group Common Cause, that only put the California Democrat eighth among the members of the 119th Congress in terms of trade volume (Connecticut Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal was first).
Both DeSantis and Luna referred to Pelosi Tuesday but acknowledged that members from both political parties are at fault.
“On average, members that do engage in stock trading on both sides are getting 600% returns now outperforming the S&P,” Luna said. “So, how could you ever expect members of Congress to truly work for the American people if this is indeed what they’re doing? And it’s wrong and it needs to stop and so I’m very happy that Gov. DeSantis has been able to lead on this effort.”
“If you look at Nancy Pelosi’s portfolio, she has absolutely shattered a lot of these investment records,” DeSantis said. “But it’s not just that. There’s a whole bunch and it’s on both sides of the aisle.”
Members of Congress are allowed to buy and sell individual stocks, as long as they don’t violate insider trading rules, under the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act of 2012 (STOCK Act).
The public perception that members of Congress are disproportionately benefitting from their positions has been growing in recent years. Members of Congress who later ascend to leadership positions outperformed rank-and-file members by 47 percentage points, according to a November 2025 paper produced by the National Bureau of Economic Research.
State legislation to address the issue
DeSantis said he believes so strongly about the issue that he is supporting state legislation to require candidates in Florida who qualify for federal races to fill out a form declaring whether they intend to trade individual stocks while serving. If those candidates run for re-election, he added, they will need to fill out a form asking them whetehr they traded any stocks while serving.
“If they say ‘yes,’ then that means they broke their word to do and, honestly, lied on those forms. That’s what we’re going to do,” he said.
DeSantis served in Congress for six years (2012-2018) and said that he stopped buying and selling stocks when he went to Washington because he didn’t want to be questioned about his integrity.
“My reason was, why would I want to be in a situation where, like, I take some action and then someday someone will say, ‘Well, that’s because you own Microsoft or you own this or that,’” he said.
DeSantis is national co-chair of a bipartisan campaign with the group U.S. Term Limits to enact congressional term limits via a constitutional amendment. And he travelled to Idaho earlier this year to promote a constitutional amendment requiring the federal government to balance its budget.
Rep. Luna has been battling with Speaker of the House Mike Johnson to force a vote on the issue. Last month, she introduced a discharge petition to move the proposal directly to the House floor, similar to the tactic used by a bipartisan group of lawmakers to force a vote on the Jeffrey Epstein files. The Pinellas Republican said Tuesday that she has received word that the bill will get a vote.
“I’m happy to report, governor, that we actually have met with the Speaker of the House and that we are going to be putting something on the floor coming up this quarter that will permanently stop insider trading ,which it is happening in Washington D.C., but it’s permanently going to stop it in D.C., so happy to report back on that,” she said.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/0-1-1024x771.jpeg,,,2026-01-06 16:58:32.153249

The project was one of five offshore wind farms that were under development until the Department of Interior ordered work halted last month due to national security concerns. It’s the second time that the Trump administration had shut down work on Revolution Wind, a 704-megawatt project that is due to begin producing power for the New England electric grid by the end of this year.
On Friday, Revolution Wind’s developers — a collaboration between Skyborn Renewables and the Danish energy company Ørsted — filed a request for a immediate injunction against the stop-work order within an ongoing lawsuit in the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C.
A hearing on the developers’ request has been scheduled for Monday, Jan. 12, in front of U.S. District Court Judge Royce C. Lamberth.
Both Tong and his counterpart in Rhode Island, Attorney General Peter Neronha, followed up with their own request on Monday which reiterated the developers’ claim that federal intervention risks raising costs for electric customers while upending thousands of local jobs.
That includes hundreds of workers at the State Pier in New London, which serves as the on-shore staging area for Revolution Wind and a sister project, Sunrise Wind.
“Donald Trump is escalating his lawless and erratic attack on Connecticut ratepayers and workers,” Tong said in a statement Tuesday. “Every day this project is stalled costs us hundreds of thousands of dollars in inflated energy bills when families are in dire need of relief. Revolution Wind was vetted and approved, and the Trump Administration has yet to disclose a shred of evidence to counter that thorough and careful process.”
In addition to their request for an injunction, both states on Monday sought to consolidate their lawsuit with the case brought by Revolution Wind’s developers. (The states’ lawsuit, originally filed in federal court in Rhode Island, has already been transferred to Washington, D.C.)
In a statement responding the injunction request on Tuesday, U.S. Department of the Interior Spokesperson Matt Middleton defended the agency’s actions by citing the costs of offshore wind projects as well as national security concerns.
“Under President Trump, this administration is putting America First by safeguarding reliable, affordable energy and defending the safety of the American people,” Middleton said. “We will not sacrifice national security or economic stability for projects that make no sense for America’s future.”
“We will not sacrifice national security or economic stability for projects that make no sense for America’s future.”Matt Middleton, U.S. Department of the Interior
In its Dec. 22 announcement of the pause on offshore wind projects, the Department of Interior cited the potential for spinning turbines to create a kind of radar interference known as “clutter” that can hamper the military’s ability to identify and track targets nearby.
The Interior Department initially said that reports detailing the potential for clutter were not classified. However, agency staff did not respond to a subsequent request by the Connecticut Mirror to provide those reports.
In a legal filing on Monday, attorneys for Interior’s Bureau of of Ocean Energy Management said they were prepared to share relevant classified information with the court in a closed-door meeting.
Critics of the Trump administration’s actions have said that national security concerns, including potential radar impacts, were extensively vetted during Revolution Wind’s multi-year vetting process.
Lamberth, the judge who is considering both injunction requests, previously sided with the project’s developers by lifting the Trump administration’s earlier stop-work order in September. At the time, Lamberth said the government had failed to provide proper justification for its decision to rescind its prior approvals for Revolution Wind.
At the time of the initial stop-work order, construction of Revolution Wind was already 80% completed. During the few months work was allowed to resume, construction progressed to around 87% completion, according to the developers’ legal filings.
The latest pause is costing Revolution Wind roughly $1.4 million a day, according to those filings, and the developers are nearing the end of their contracts with the specially-built vessels needed to mount the massive turbines onto their foundations. 
If they are forced to cancel the project due to delays, Revolution Wind’s developers say they will be saddled with an additional $1 billion in costs on top of their current $5 billion investment.
If it is completed, Revolution Wind will be supported by power purchase agreements with electric utilities in Connecticut and Rhode Island. Its sister project, Sunrise Wind, is slated to sell its power to customers in New York.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Revolution-installed-turbine-file-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-06 16:58:32.153249

The measure passed out of the committee with no audible opposition. If passed into law, the proposal would pump at least $1 billion into the Public Employee Retirement System over the next decade. 
Sen. Daniel Sparks, a Republican from Belmont who authored the legislation, said giving the Public Employees’ Retirement System a large cash infusion is a necessary next step after the Legislature last year overhauled it, moving forward.
“The employees of the state of Mississippi have done their part,” Sparks said. “Now we’ve got to fund it.”
The cash injection comes after the Legislature voted last year to create a new system with fewer benefits for new hires that will be a hybrid of a defined contribution plan, similar to the 401(k) system many private employers offer, and a defined benefit plan, which the state has had for decades. 
Opponents of the new hybrid plan say its more austere benefits will make it hard for the state to hire and retain workers, particularly first responders and teachers. First responders, through their associations of chiefs of police and firefighters, are calling on lawmakers to create a separate retirement plan for them.
Both Sparks and Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann have defended the hybrid plan as a necessary change to prevent the pension system from disastrous shortfalls in the future, while still giving state employees a retirement package. The system has unfunded liabilities of about $26 billion.
House leaders have proposed a recurring revenue stream for PERS, either from the state lottery or by legalizing mobile sports betting.
Sparks on Tuesday did not appear receptive to those proposals, and said such earmarked streams would not stabilize the system like the large cash infusion the committee passed. The Senate measure now heads to the full chamber.
PERS covers about 350,000 current public employees or retirees — about 10% of the state’s population. Changes to the system can have a substantial economic impact on the state in the future.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/06034415/3X0A4453-copy-scaled.jpg,,,2026-01-06 16:58:32.153249

Kim Reynolds initiated a state task force to evaluate the potential for nuclear energy expansion in Iowa.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Efforts to expand nuclear energy in Iowa have kicked off in 2026 with the formation of a state nuclear energy task force and the Linn County approval of a rezoning request for Iowa’s sole nuclear plant’s planned restart.
The Iowa Nuclear Energy Task Force, initiated by Gov. Kim Reynolds, will generate a report and advise state leadership on opportunities to embrace nuclear energy in the state of Iowa. 
Reynolds said in a news release the task force marks a “strategic step forward” to ensuring Iowa has a “safe, efficient, and responsible integration” of nuclear energy. 
“Nuclear energy is a vital part of Iowa’s energy future, and I am committed to advancing reliable, sustainable energy solutions that strengthen our energy independence and fuel economic growth,” Reynolds said. “With our strong foundation in manufacturing and energy innovation, we are uniquely positioned to lead the nation in developing and deploying nuclear technologies.” 
Presently, Iowa has no operational nuclear energy plants, but NextEra Energy is working to restart the Duane Arnold Energy Center in Linn County. The company’s request to rezone close to 400 acres at the site was approved by Linn County Supervisors Monday, though there are still several regulatory hurdles NextEra must cross to be operational at the start of 2029 as it plans.
The plant, if restarted, would generate 615 megawatts of energy and have more than 400 onsite, full-time jobs. Google signed an agreement with NextEra in October to purchase power from Duane Arnold nuclear site to power Google cloud and artificial intelligence operations.

Lane Witten, a vice president at NextEra, was chosen as one of 14 members to serve on the Iowa Nuclear Energy Task Force. 
The task force is chaired by Mark Nutt, a graduate of Iowa State University’s Nuclear Engineering program and the director of Nuclear Energy Programs at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. Other members represent utilities, local government, industry and the Iowa Utilities Commission. 
State legislators Sen. Mike Bousselot, R-Ankeny; Sen. Izaah Knox, D-Des Moines; Rep. David Young, R-Van Meter; Rep. Hans Wilz, R-Ottumwa, and Rep. Sean Bagniewski, D-Des Moines, also serve on the task force. 
According to the news release, the task force is asked to assess emerging nuclear technologies for Iowa’s energy sector, engage with industry leaders to help develop the necessary workforce for the industry, as well as engage with manufacturers and other stakeholders to identify potential barriers to entry in the nuclear field. 
The task force is also asked to explore engagement opportunities with federal nuclear energy programs to “ensure Iowa’s policies and initiatives align with national regulations” and to evaluate opportunities for economic growth within the nuclear energy sector. 
While energy consumption remained fairly stable across the U.S. from 2000-2020, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, a recent report from the consulting firm ICF projected overall energy demand will increase by 25% by 2030. The report attributes the growth in part to data centers that power cloud and artificial intelligence models, as well as increased electrification in transportation and building sectors. 
Reynolds has identified nuclear energy as one of her priorities to build an “affordable, reliable and sustainable energy system” for the state. The governor’s energy bill from the 2025 legislative session also called for the General Assembly to “encourage the development” of nuclear electric power generation, but the bill did not make it to the floor for debate in either chamber. 
Nuclear energy expansion and acceleration has also been a priority outlined by President Donald Trump. NextEra’s website for the Duane Arnold restart claims the project contributes “toward the Administration’s goal of adding 5,000 megawatts of nuclear energy by 2030.” 
According to the news release, the task force has 180 days to submit a final report on its findings and recommendations to the governor, per the executive order. 
Additional task force members include:
May Farlinger, president of Alliant Energy’s Iowa company, Interstate Power & Light Company; Mike Fehr, senior vice president of renewable generation and compliance at MidAmerican Energy; Brandy Meisheid, chair of the Linn County Board of Supervisors; Jim McCalley, distinguished professor at Iowa State University; Sarah Martz, chair of the Iowa Utilities Commission; Matt Resor, business manager for IBEW Local 405, and Andy Roberts with Central Iowa Building & Construction Trades Council.

John Larson as ally in fight against Trump,Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/06/william-tong-endorses-john-larson-as-ally-in-fight-against-trump/,U.S. Rep. John B. Larson accepted the endorsement of A.G. William Tong on the fifth anniversary of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.,"U.S. Rep. John B. Larson, D-1st District, accepted the endorsement of Attorney General William Tong on the fifth anniversary of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, each ignoring the congressman’s three Democratic rivals to focus on their party’s great unifier: President Donald Trump.
The chosen venue for the Tuesday morning press conference was the community center named for his late mother, Lois Nolan Larson, at Mayberry Village, the one-time federal housing project in East Hartford that has been a blue-collar touchstone for Larson through his nearly 50 years in public life, the last 27 as a congressman.
Tong, the first of the state’s six statewide constitutional officers to take sides in the rare intra-party challenge to a Connecticut congressional incumbent, said he and Larson share modest beginnings that shape their politics and fuel their opposition to a president the attorney general has sued 45 times this year.
“I don’t have to guess what John Larson is about. I don’t have to guess what this campaign is about. It’s about the people that live here,” said Tong, the son of Chinese immigrants. “It’s about the people that fight for every inch, every single day.”
Larson, 77, who has not had a Democratic primary since winning the open seat in 1998, is facing a challenge from former Hartford Mayor Luke Bronin, state Rep. Jillian Gilchrest of West Hartford, and Hartford school board member Ruth Fortune.
Tong’s repeated references to Mayberry Village and  Larson’s upbringing in a public housing seemed calculated to draw a contrast with Bronin, who grew up in Rye, N.Y., and Greenwich, and is by far the best funded of the three challengers. 
Larson is “fighting for people that come to Mayberry Village, that come to the community center here. He’s fighting for immigrants like my parents, who walk around with a target on their backs every single day,” Tong said. “That’s why I’m supporting John Larson. The other reason why I’m supporting John Larson is because in our official roles, we are on the front lines of this fight against a president and the federal government that every day seeks to do us harm.”
Tong’s endorsement was expected. He had joined Larson in September in opposing the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigrants and speaking out against the Department of Homeland Security targeting the congressman over his harsh criticism of the tactics employed by DHE’s  Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.
Larson had compared masked ICE agents to the SS and Gestapo of Nazi Germany.
On Tuesday, Larson accused Secretary of State Marco Rubio of lying to Congress when he assured members that the Trump administration was not working for regime change in Venezuela, not long before U.S. commandos seized its president, Nicolas Maduro, snubbing congressional leaders who should have been consulted.
“How about respect for the law, the Constitution and the War Powers Act?” Larson said. 
He offered sarcastic praise for the president on one count.
“At least he was honest about this: It’s about the oil. It’s about the oil and taking over those refineries,” Larson said. “And by the way, who’s going to defend those refineries and the American corporations that go there? And who’s going to defend that pipeline? United States military. This president and his administration need to come before Congress.”
Larson said Democrats need more than criticism of Trump and pivoted to a favorite topic: the preservation of Social Security. He faulted Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee after President Joe Biden quit the race, for failing to talk about issues other than Trump’s fitness.
“I begged the Harris administration to talk about Social Security, to put it out there, and we didn’t. We talked about Donald Trump, and as bad as he is, if you don’t have a plan, you’re not going to be successful. And we will have a plan, and you’ll hear about it in more detail.”
Larson said he is working with two other members of the House Ways and Means Committee, Richard Neal of Massachusetts and Mike Thompson of California, on legislation addressing student debt and the difficulty in renters becoming homeowners.
“We’re going to be back to the new New Deal,” Larson said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_9382-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-06 16:58:32.153249

This is down from an overall rate of 29.77 the year prior, and 32.56 in 2021 — the year that the agency switched to publishing what is known as “incident based reporting” data. Due to the difference in definitions and categories, comparing rates with prior years is often not “apples to apples,” the report notes.

Almost 60% of the crimes reported in 2024 were crimes against property, like theft, and less than half of that, 12,586, were crimes committed against people. Slightly more than 4,700 reported crimes were considered crimes against society, such as drug violations, gambling and prostitution.
Violent crimes such as murders, rapes, aggravated assaults and robberies have generally been low in Maine, but followed the overall trend, declining steadily from 1,432 in 2021 to 1,374 in the latest report.

Dec. 7, 2023. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The University of Nebraska will pay outgoing University of Nebraska-Lincoln Chancellor Rodney Bennett a one-time sum of $1.1 million as part of his Jan. 12 resignation agreement.
The compensation is part of Bennett’s negotiated resignation, which Bennett and NU President Jeffrey Gold agreed to Jan. 2 and announced Monday. 
The Nebraska Examiner obtained the agreement via a public records request Tuesday. Bennett joined UNL as chancellor on July 1, 2023, for a three-year term until June 30, 2026. Bennett will leave about six months early, ranking his tenure among the shortest of UNL chancellors.
“Chancellor Bennett acknowledges and agrees that he is resigning his employment with the university voluntarily, without duress, based upon his own belief that it is in his own best interest to do so,” the agreement states.

20260102 Bennett Resignation Agreement Release_Redacted 
Bennett signed the resignation at 4:24 p.m. Jan. 2. Gold signed it an hour later. Bennett could revoke the agreement in writing within seven days of signing. Bennett was given 21 days to consider the agreement, the document states. 
He voluntarily signed sooner.
Multiple members of the UNL chapter of the American Association of University Professors condemned the resignation agreement in light of recent budget cuts at UNL that Bennett steered.
Gold did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday regarding the resignation agreement. Asked if Bennett could sit down for an interview in the next week, a UNL spokesperson said Bennett “is not currently available for interviews.” 
Resignation specifics
In October, Bennett told the Examiner he desired a contract extension but did not know if or when that might occur. Gold said then he supported an extension but said it was a decision left to the NU Board of Regents. In December, Bennett said the Examiner had to “talk to the boss” about his contract.
As part of the resignation agreement, the regents will pay Bennett nearly $1.14 million “as soon as possible,” but no later than late February. The sum includes $36,000 for dental and group health insurance for the remaining months of his insurance eligibility period.
The NU Board of Regents hired Bennett at a salary of $720,000 in 2023. His salary increased to $732,000 the following two years, or $61,000 per month, according to NU salary records.

Bennett will not receive at least $250,000 in “deferred compensation” from his contract,  an amount tied to his salary. His wages end Jan. 12, an NU spokesperson confirmed, and he will not be paid for the remaining five and a half months.
Gold said a search for a permanent UNL chancellor would likely begin in mid to late spring.
Kathy Ankerson, former UNL chief academic officer and former dean of UNL’s College of Architecture, will take over for Bennett in the interim. Her salary was not immediately available. 
If Bennett had resigned to seek or accept an administrative post at another academic institution or higher education campus before June 30, 2025, he would have been required to pay NU $1 million.
On Monday, Gold told the Examiner that Bennett’s choice to resign was a “very personal decision” and a “fairly abrupt decision” made with his family.
The agreement barred Bennett and NU leaders from releasing it unless requested under public records laws. Bennett is barred from disparaging UNL in the future, as are regents and other top NU leaders. Gold’s office will prepare Bennett a reference letter for future employment, too.
Bennett is barred from being employed at any NU campus for three years under the resignation’s terms, and Bennett agreed to cooperate in transitioning his duties over the next three months.
Resignation follows budget cuts
Bennett’s departure and payout come after UNL finalized $27.5 million in cuts last fall, including the elimination of four academic programs with regents’ approval in December. After that meeting, Bennett told the Examiner the campus had “a lot of work to do” with implementation.
“We’re going to do that with a lot of care and concern for everybody who’s impacted,” he said.
Bennett’s plan included cuts meant to close a $21 million structural deficit and $6.5 million in “proactive” steps to mitigate the need for future cuts.

UNL’s AAUP chapter said the payout demonstrates the cuts were a choice, including for the more than 50 faculty and 500 students in the departments approved to be eliminated.
Another 69 UNL long-time, tenured faculty had until Monday to decide whether to take an NU-wide early retirement offer. It’s not yet clear how many accepted the one-time lump sum.
Bennett, in November, became the first UNL chancellor to receive a vote of “no confidence” from UNL faculty. The vote passed 60-14, citing, among other concerns, his handling of the budget.
“The university cannot credibly claim that it lacks the resources to sustain academic programs and faculty positions while simultaneously paying over a million dollars to a failed chancellor,” said Sarah Zuckerman, president of the UNL AAUP. “This payout exposes the administration’s financial crisis narrative as a matter of priorities, not necessity.”
Administrator pay
Crystal Garcia, an AAUP Executive Committee member, said the public deserves to know why educators are being fired while “executive failures are rewarded.” Garcia and Zuckerman are in the Department of Educational Administration, which the regents voted to eliminate 8-0.
“Nebraska’s legislators and taxpayers should be asking hard questions about governance, oversight and whose interests are truly being served,” Garcia said.

Alexander Vazansky, another UNL AAUP Executive Committee member and professor in the UNL Department of History, said Bennett’s situation is “not just a failure of one chancellor” but also of a “systemic failure of leadership at the highest levels,” including Gold and the regents.
The AAUP called for an immediate halt to faculty and staff terminations, reconsideration of the elimination of academic programs and full transparency into university finances, including executive compensation and information used to make budget decisions.
Regent Kathy Wilmot of Beaver City thanked and defended Bennett’s work handling the budget after the “no confidence” vote and after the December regents meeting.
State Sen. Dave Murman of Glenvil, chair of the Legislature’s Education Committee, said Tuesday he was “very disappointed” Bennett is resigning. Murman noted he’s frequently talked about being careful with administrator pay, at all levels of education, but deferred to NU on its decision for any buyout.
Said Murman of Bennett: “I think he’s done a good job as chancellor under very challenging circumstances.”

Greene, a conservative Republican who was once one of President Donald Trump’s most stalwart allies, announced plans to resign in November after publicly feuding with the president over issues including health care costs, Israel’s actions in Gaza and the release of the Epstein files.
The two also reportedly clashed behind the scenes over whether Greene should run for either U.S. Senate or Georgia governor, which Trump said he disapproved of her doing.
Monday was Greene’s final day representing Georgia’s District 14 in Congress after four years in office.
Early voting is set to begin on Monday, Feb. 16 in the district, which includes Catoosa, Chattooga, Dade, Floyd, Murray, Paulding, Polk, Walker and Whitfield counties and portions of Cobb County.
The winner will serve the remainder of Greene’s term and be up for re-election all over again in November.
If no candidate exceeds 50% of the vote, a runoff between the top two will be held on April 7.
That’s a pretty likely outcome – as of Tuesday afternoon, 22 candidates have already filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission to run. Candidates from both parties will all appear on the March 10 ballot together.
The official qualifying period will run from Jan. 12 to 14, so the total number of candidates could grow even higher.
The northwest Georgia district is the most heavily Republican district in the state, and Greene was known as a staunch conservative, appearing alongside Trump at rallies, echoing his false claims of election interference and boosting him on social media before their falling out.
The district’s strong Republican base makes it a plum spot for a conservative lawmaker who would like to avoid challenges from the left.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)Kentucky lawmakers are expected to propose more than 1,000 bills this year, and several wasted no time by filing legislation on the first day of the 60-day session. 
On Tuesday, Republicans filed bills to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs in Kentucky public schools and have the state honor the late conservative activist Charlie Kirk, while Democrats, who hold a small minority in the statehouse, filed a bill to raise the state’s minimum wage. 
High priority bills are still to come, including the legislation for the next two-year state budget. 
On the Republican side, Sen. Lindsey Tichenor, of Smithfield, filed a bill to prevent Kentucky public schools from having any kind of DEI program, or risk legal action from the Kentucky attorney general’s office. Among its several provisions, Senate Bill 26 prohibits schools using resources to keep DEI offices, having DEI training or employees whose role is related to advancing DEI. 
Tichenor previously presented the proposal in committee during the interim, arguing that it would “eliminate the wasteful, ineffective and divisive DEI initiatives” in K-12 schools. 
Sen. Steve Rawlings, R-Burlington, filed Senate Bill 31 to designate Oct. 14 of each year as “Charlie Kirk Day” in honor of the right-wing activist who was assassinated at Utah Valley University in September. Kirk’s birthday is Oct. 14. 
Kirk was the founder of Turning Point USA, which aimed to mobilize conservative youth and young adults on high school and college campuses. He often visited campuses around the country to discuss contemporary hard-right topics, including anti-LGBTQ positions and encouraging young women to retreat from careers and return to the home. Kirk also hosted a daily radio show and podcast. 
Rawlings’ bill says Kentuckians would be encouraged to use the day to “reflect on the principles he championed, participate in educational events promoting civic engagement, and honor his legacy as a martyr for truth and liberty.”

Meanwhile, Democratic Whip Sen. Cassie Chambers Armstrong, of Louisville filed a resolution to honor Minnesota House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman, who was killed along with her husband, Mark, in June, as well as a resolution to condemn all acts of political violence. 
Lexington Sen. Reggie Thomas, the Democrats’ caucus chair, said in a Tuesday morning press conference he would file a bill, Senate Bill 16, on the first day of the legislative session to increase Kentucky’s minimum wage from the federal rate of $7.25 an hour to $10 an hour. The legislation would also include the state eventually moving toward a $15 an hour minimum wage in 2030. 
Thomas said 30 states, including five states neighboring Kentucky, have a higher minimum wage than the federal rate. 
“We don’t have to be tied to the federal minimum wage,” Thomas said. “Thirty other states have acknowledged that. Why should we be different? There’s no reason why Kentucky should be at the bottom in terms of saying what our workers should be paying.” 
Senate Democratic Floor Leader Gerald Neal, of Louisville, added that Thomas’ bill would be a “primary position of the caucus” and Senate Democrats would try to sway their Republican counterparts on supporting the measure. Senate Democrats are beginning this session with six members to the Republicans’ 32. 
Temporary chambers

Tuesday was the first time the Senate and House had convened in temporary quarters near the Capitol Annex while the Capitol undergoes a multi-year renovation.
Rules in both chambers were updated to reflect that neither the House or Senate will have in-person galleries for members of the public to watch legislative proceedings. 
In the Senate, Republican Floor Leader Max Wise, of Campbellsville, gave a summary of the Senate rules changes, including removing references to the gallery in the chamber, as the temporary chamber has no seats for members of the public to view proceedings in-person, and limiting guests who may come to the Senate floor to lawmakers, their immediate family members, staff and reporters. The Senate approved its rules in a voice vote without any senators objecting to the changes.
However, two House Democrats expressed concern about shortening the daily business order of motions, petitions and communications for lawmakers from 30 minutes to 15, but the rules were still adopted. Republican House Floor Leader Rep. Steven Rudy, of Paducah, said the limitation was because lawmakers could not have floor guests to introduce this year. Much of the House changes were similar to the Senate rules.
More to come
In other matters, the House must review impeachment petitions it received earlier this year, including a petition filed by Louisville attorney and GOP official Jack Richardson against Supreme Court Justice Pamela Goodwine. 
Osborne told reporters lawmakers are still talking about forming a committee to handle citizen petitions the House received.
On the petition to impeach Goodwine, Stivers said he’s told Senate Republicans to “say nothing about it” while it’s still in the House’s purview. 
“We should wait for the House to come up with some type of dispositive action, because we will be the jury, the trier of facts, so we should not in any way weigh in to express an opinion one way or another,” Stivers continued. “That would be, from my perspective, totally inappropriate and improper.” 
Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear has made a push for the state funding universal pre-K ahead of session, but it must clear the GOP-controlled legislature. 
Stivers told reporters that it is a “flawed concept.” Republicans do agree that access to child care is an issue that should be addressed, but not through universal pre-K.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_5529-1024x709.jpg,,,2026-01-06 16:12:37.247768

(Photo by Alon Skuy/Getty Images)CLEARWATER — Gov. Ron DeSantis admits he wasn’t familiar with the federal legislation vetoed by Donald Trump last week that would have given the Miccosukee Tribe more control over a portion of the Everglades.
But he says he agrees with the president’s assertion that the tribe has worked against the president’s immigration efforts.
In his statement last week announcing his veto of H.R. 504, the Miccosukee Reserved Area Amendments Act, sponsored by South Florida Republican U.S. Rep. Carlos Giménez, Trump declared the Miccosukee Tribe “has actively sought to obstruct reasonable immigration policies that the American people decisively voted for when I was elected.”
That was a reference to the fact that the Miccosukee Tribe of Florida is part of a lawsuit against the state which claims planners behind an immigration detention center in the Everglades, dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz,” failed to follow federal environmental regulations in constructing the 3,000-bed facility.
The legislation (previously supported by a bipartisan group of Florida lawmakers, including U.S. GOP Sens. Rick Scott and Ashley Moody) would have added a small village called the Osceola Camp to a section of the Florida Everglades that the Miccosukee Native American Tribe controls. It would also require the Department of the Interior to protect structures in the village from flooding.
“What he pointed out — [the tribe] is trying to obstruct the immigration — that is true,” DeSantis said during a press conference in Clearwater Tuesday. “I mean, they tried to obstruct and it was demagogic, they were not being honest about what was going on.”
The governor went on to call the Miccosukee Tribe “wrong” and said it was “disappointing to see them do that,” apparently referring to the organization’s involvement in the lawsuit.
The Miccosukee Tribe did not immediately respond to a request for comment about DeSantis’ remarks, but a spokesperson told the Phoenix Monday that they have “long supported President Trump’s commitment to Everglades restoration for the benefit of America’s public lands.”
“The Tribe has a constitutional duty to protect and defend the Everglades ecosystem, our traditional homelands. We never sought to obstruct the President’s immigration agenda. Instead, we have taken action to ensure sufficient environmental due diligence is performed to protect federal restoration investments,” Chairman Talbert Cypress said in a written statement.
He added that the tribe was “disappointed to learn that the White House vetoed a measure intended to mitigate restoration impacts on a Tribal village.”
Politico reported Monday that the U.S. House of Representatives will vote Thursday whether to override two vetoes, one being of HR 504. That outlet reported that “senior House Republicans and Democrats generally expect the chamber will approve the overrides in a rare rebuke of Trump.”
Prosecuting Maduro in Florida?
DeSantis also said on Tuesday that Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier’s office is “looking very seriously” at bringing a state criminal case against Nicolás Maduro, removed Saturday as president of Venezuela by U.S. troops on four criminal counts that include narco-terrorism, cocaine importation conspiracy, and possession of machine guns and destructive devices. He pleaded not guilty to those charges in federal court in New York on Monday.
Because Maduro “was obviously very involved with bringing drugs, particularly to Florida,” DeSantis said, the state could charge  him with bringing criminals and gang members here.
The former Venezuelan president “would empty his prisons and send them to America across the border, and we’d end up with some of these people in Florida, Tren de Aragua gang members that were in prison there and he did that, and so to me that is a very hostile act,” he said.

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)North Carolina Supreme Court Justice Anita Earls announced Tuesday that she was diagnosed with breast cancer late last year.
“I had surgery over the holidays and will continue a course of treatment to address this disease,” said Earls in a video released on social media.
Earls told supporters that the diagnosis will not impact her ability to continue to serve on the court or campaign.
“We are not slowing down. We are not losing focus. This is just a bump in the road on the way to a win this November,” said Earls. “And we all know courageous women who have experienced breast cancer and treated it successfully, including some of our most brilliant political leaders here in North Carolina.”
Earls said she is fortunate that the disease was discovered early during a routine mammogram, and it’s because of that early detection that her prognosis is positive.

“I know it can be easy to put off doctor’s appointments, but I encourage every woman to get regularly screened for breast cancer,” said Earls.
State representative Sarah Stevens (R-Surry) is running this year against Earls for a seat on the state’s highest court. In January 2024, Stevens announced that she too had undergone treatment for breast cancer. Stevens told the Associated Press breast cancer runs among women in her family, and she expected to make a full recovery.
Breast cancer survivors serving in the state House and Senate urged legislators last year to pass legislation that would provide health coverage parity for breast cancer diagnostic imaging.
“You shouldn’t be in a situation where women are denied access [to care] because they can’t afford the actual screenings,” said Senate Democratic Leader Sydney Batch (D-Wake) during a press conference last April.
The Senate did not advance Batch’s bill after its introduction. In the N.C. House, Rep. Howard Penny Jr. (R-Harnett) encouraged lawmakers to support a companion bill for better breast imaging, noting he had also been treated for breast cancer. House Bill 297 passed the House with Penny’s help, only to stall in the Senate.

(Stock photo by Getty Images)A Florida bill banning drivers from holding their phones on the road was re-filed Tuesday, one week before the start of the 2026 legislative session.
Republican Sen. Erin Grall’s bill, revived from last session, would expand the Sunshine State’s ban on texting while driving to cover holding or “supporting” a handheld device while on the road.
This means drivers would not be able to make calls from their phone, hold it, or even rest it on their laps if the bill becomes law. If passed, it would take effect on Oct. 1.
“‘Handheld manner’ means holding a wireless communications device in one or both hands or physically supporting the device with any other part of the body,” SB 1152 reads. These devices could range from phones to laptops to gaming devices.
The bill would not apply to first responders or include small radios or in-vehicle systems.
Drivers who violate the law while moving through either a school zone or past construction workers would be slapped with a $150 fine and 3 points off their licenses. A subsequent offense would include a $250 fine and 3 more points against the license, and a third offense would include a $500 fine, 4 points against the license, and a 90-day license suspension.
Where did the bill come from?
Tallahassee resident Demetrius Branca has been a leading advocate for a hands-free driving law, which would mirror those of 30 other states plus Washington, D.C. In 2014, Branca’s 19-year-old son Anthony while on his way to Tallahassee State College was killed by a distracted Comcast driver.
During the 2024 session, when the measure passed the House but was never scheduled in the Senate, Branca blasted then-chairman of the Senate Transportation Committee, Nick DiCeglie, during a Pinellas County legislative delegation meeting. The two engaged in a sharp exchange, but DiCeglie changed course when the bill reemerged during the 2025 legislative session, the Phoenix previously reported.
“I looked at the statistics,” DiCeglie said at the time. “I looked at the data, and I looked at what 31 other states did. And I thought of you and I thought of your son, Anthony.”
Although it passed the Senate that time around, the legislation was never scheduled in the House — a reversal from the year before. Branca blamed Rep. Linda Chaney, who chaired one of the committees that was supposed to see the bill.
“You stopped it cold,” Branca told her at a Pinellas County legislative meeting. “After all the work, all the testimony, all the grieving parents who begged you to act. You chose to not let it through. That was not leadership, that was political cowardice and I’m standing here to look you in the eye and tell you to your face.”
In 2023, distracted driving resulted in the deaths of 3,275 people, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which reported that “texting is the most alarming distraction.”
This year, Grall’s bill has yet to have a House companion.

(Photo by Will Jacott/Minnesota Reformer) Three senior leaders in the finance department of Minneapolis Public Schools have been placed on administrative leave, according to two people with knowledge of the personnel decisions, just as the district begins its annual budget process. 
Administration of the state’s fourth largest school district placed the three leaders on leave Friday, according to the two people familiar with the moves. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were  not authorized to speak publicly.
The officials placed on leave are Ibrahima Diop, senior finance officer; Tarior Chapinduka, executive director of finance; and Aaron Gilbert, controller. 
When reached by phone, Gilbert would not confirm her employment with the district and would not provide further comment. Diop and Chapinduka did not respond to voice messages left seeking comment.
Donnie Belcher, executive director of communications, said the district could not comment on the personnel changes due to personnel privacy laws.
The school board is set to vote Tuesday night to designate certain financial authorizations to Senior Executive Officer Ryan Strack. These designations were previously held by Diop.
The removal of finance department leadership comes at a crucial time for the district. The district expects a $30 million gap between its revenue and expenses next school year, or roughly 4% of the annual budget. . This deficit comes despite the district cutting more than $70 million in expenses during its last budget cycle, and voters approving a $20 million increase to the district’s operating capital levy in 2024.
The district failed to complete its annual financial audit by the state deadline of December 31. The district’s auditor, Bergen KDV, told the board on December 9, 2025, that the delay was because the district’s finance department had failed to provide the necessary on time. The auditors expect to finish by the end of January.
The district as an ongoing structural budget deficit as costs — primarily wages and benefits — continue to grow faster than revenue. The structural deficit is exacerbated by the district’s physical footprint, designed to serve over 40,000 students while only 28,000 students are currently enrolled. 
The district’s auditors have warned for years that the district lacks sufficient finance department staff to appropriately segregate its accounts payable and accounts receivable functions.
Superintendent Lisa Sayles-Adams made significant changes to the district’s leadership after she started in February 2023. Diop was one of the few district leaders hired by former Superintendent Ed Graff that she left in place.
Staff were told in December that Diop would end his tenure with the district at the end of January. Diop joined the district as its senior finance officer in 2015, under the leadership of former superintendentGraff. At the time, the district was in financial turmoil, with the board spending down district reserves rather than making budget cuts to erase a $27 million budget deficit. 
During Diop’s tenure with the district, district enrollment dropped over 20%. The majority of district revenue is tied to enrollment, while state law limits the district’s property tax levies. This forces school districts to cut expenses to balance their budgets.
Chapinduka was first hired by the district by Diop; both had previously worked together for Omaha Public Schools in Nebraska. Chapinduka left the district to work at Hopkins Public Schools in 2019 before returning to Minneapolis in 2025.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MinneapolisSchool_1-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-06 15:57:36.201107

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana legislators are talking about possibly banning one form of internet gambling while also giving the Hoosier Lottery permission to sell tickets online.
The House Public Policy Committee endorsed a bill on Tuesday allowing online lottery sales, a move sought for years by state lottery officials as a way to boost revenues.
Another proposal under discussion by the committee would prohibit so-called online “sweepstakes” games where players can win money from simulated casino games.
Hoosier Lottery’s online push
Illinois, Kentucky and Michigan are among 18 states currently with online lottery sales, said Jared Bond, the Hoosier Lottery’s external affairs director.
“When the Hoosier Lottery was created in 1989 … there was really only one way to buy a lottery ticket,” Bond said. “You walked into a retailer with cash, but today Hoosiers utilize their mobile devices for all kinds of different things, like banking and to shop.”
Online lottery sales likely wouldn’t start until the summer of 2027 as lottery officials hire the needed vendors and set up measures to confirm app users are at least 18 years and are within the state lines when making purchases.
Committee members voted 9-3 to advance House Bill 1078 to the full House for consideration, as some members objected to the bill not including provisions allowing the state’s casinos to offer online games.

The committee last year endorsed a bill for both online lottery and casino games, but it didn’t reach the full House for a vote amid concerns that internet gambling would draw business away from physical casinos and risk greater gambling addiction.
“I strongly feel that i-gaming and i-lottery should be hand in hand, and we’re picking winners and losers,” said Rep. Cory Criswell, R-Middletown. “I don’t think that’s the way it should work.”
An analysis prepared by the Legislative Services Agency projects that online sales would boost the Hoosier Lottery’s revenues by between $314 million and $629 million in the third year. That would increase the lottery’s annual profits — $340 million for fiscal year 2025 — by between $31 million and $94 million in the third year.
The lottery’s sales have been flat at around $1.7 billion for the past five years.
Lisa Hutcheson, the vice president for prevention and policy at Mental Health America of Indiana, warned committee members about rising gambling addiction among young men with the proliferation of sports wagering.
Hutcheson said online gambling such as i-lottery “removes many of the physical safeguards that exist in brick-and-mortar facilities.”
“Online gambling heightens those risks through constant access, targeted advertising, secrecy and the perception of quick financial gain,” she said.
If given approval for online sales, the Hoosier Lottery could sell tickets for instant games and jackpot drawings such as Powerball and MegaMillions via the internet and host online instant games on its website. 
“Sweepstakes” ban considered
A separate proposal under discussion would prohibit any online “sweepstakes” game that “simulates casino-style gaming, including slot machines, video poker, table games, lottery games, bingo, and sports wagering.”
Such games are not specifically covered by Indiana law, so the state Gaming Commission doesn’t have authority to set rules or monitor them, said Natalie Huffman, the commission’s general counsel.
Other than sports wagering, Indiana’s 13 state-regulated casinos are not allowed to offer online gambling.
The sweepstakes games, however, have gained an estimated 200,000 players in Indiana, said Sean Ostrow of the Social Gaming Leadership Alliance, an industry lobbying group.

Rep. Ethan Manning, chair of the Public Policy Committee, said he supported legalizing i-gaming by the casinos but is sponsoring House Bill 1052 that includes the ban on sweepstakes games.
“People are going to sweeps because that’s what’s available right now, even though it’s a black or gray market, depending on your perspective,” said Manning, R-Logansport. “But if i-gaming were legal here … there wouldn’t be much market for the sweeps casinos.”
Huffman said eight states had banned such games and that Indiana was among nine states currently considering doing so. 
Representatives of companies providing sweepstakes games told the committee that no states were regulating the games so far.
They said they were open to discussions about state oversight and taxation, arguing that a ban would push out responsible companies that try to ensure only those older than 21 play the games and work to prevent fraud and money laundering activities. 
“If this bill passes and legitimate companies like us are forced to exit, consumer demand will still remain and our players will simply drift to those offshore sites that have no compunction about operating illegally, allowing minors to participate and not paying out legitimate prizes,” said Dan Marks, chief financial office of Miami-based ARB Interactive.
The committee did not vote on the bill Tuesday, with Manning saying he expected to bring it back for further action in the next couple of weeks.

(Laura Paskus for Source NM)A male house finch belts out his springtime song. Mustard greens have pushed through the loam in my backyard. The hyssop and salvia are greening up, and so are the Mexican sage and globemallow. Sunflowers and poppies are sprouting, and I slept Sunday night with the window cracked open — 38 degrees is usually my threshold for allowing cold air into the room. In the morning, there’s not even a skiff of ice on the birdbath water.
Like many of you, I’ve been walking a fine line between joy and terror this winter. 
Oh, it’s so nice to be outside! And I love listening for screech owls and coyotes at night. But these balmy days and nights fill me with dread. They aren’t just omens of a hot, dry year. They also weaken ecosystems and species that rely upon winter. Including humans. 
In 2025, Albuquerque experienced its hottest year on record, and at the end of December, more than 80% of the state was in drought. 
In early January, Red Flag warnings already exist for Quay, Curry and Roosevelt counties. The National Interagency Fire Center is forecasting above normal wildlife potential for eastern New Mexico in February. And  the soil moisture map looks like the state is breaking out into measles. 
Snowpack across New Mexico is grim. (Do you really want to see the median numbers as of early January? Rio Grande Headwaters in Colorado: 52 percent. Upper Rio Grande in New Mexico: 30. San Juan River Basin: 51. Rio Chama River Basin: 57. Jemez River Basin: 17. Pecos River Basin: 34.) And we’re facing continued La Niña conditions, at least through the next three months. 
‘Snow drought’ observed across the West, amid higher-than-average winter temps

Meanwhile, New Mexico doesn’t have much in its water savings account; just look at the reservoir numbers from the top of the Rio Chama to the Lower Rio Grande in New Mexico. Heron Reservoir is 7% full; El Vado, 13%; Abiquiu, 58%; Elephant Butte, 8%; and Caballo, 7%.
From this vantage point in early January — with a few decades of warming temperatures, drying rivers, burning forests and aridifying croplands already behind us — it’s clear that human-caused climate change is tightening the noose on a viable future for New Mexicans, and for the wildlife and ecosystems we are bound to, inextricably.
In 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a special report, noting that if the Earth’s temperature increased by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius, the climate consequences will be “long-lasting” and “irreversible.” Scientists wrote that human-caused emissions of carbon dioxide would need to “fall by about 45 percent from 2010 levels by 2030, reaching ‘net zero’ by 2050.” 
In 2025, the Earth passed the 1.5-degree Celsius threshold. And we’re nowhere near to cutting greenhouse gas emissions by significant levels. 
Nothing that’s happening right now should be a surprise — not the melting ice caps nor the drying rivers. We’ve had decades to pivot or at least prepare. 
Yet, 60 years after President Lyndon Johnson’s science advisory committee warned that the carbon dioxide humans were sending into the atmosphere would cause changes that could be “deleterious from the point of view of human beings,” in 2025, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin launched the Powering the Great American Comeback Initiative, deregulating industries and “driving a dagger straight into the heart of climate change religion.” 
Meanwhile, U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Chris Wright last year told The Guardian that he’s not a climate skeptic. Rather, he’s a “climate realist.” 
“The Trump administration will treat climate change for what it is, a global physical phenomenon that is a side-effect of building the modern world,” Wright said. “Everything in life involves trade-off.”
The men spearheading the Trump administration’s plans know climate change threatens the lives of billions of people and ecosystems ranging from the sea’s coral reefs to Earth’s mountaintops. And their tradeoffs involve the calculated obliteration of longstanding federal environmental laws, the privatization of public lands and watersheds, and of course, the subversion of climate science. (Not to mention, the waging of illegal wars.)
In just a few weeks, New Mexico state legislators will convene for a 30-day session. It’s a fast-paced budget session, which means climate and water won’t top the list of priorities, again. No matter what the mustard greens, house finches, bare mountaintops, and drastically low reservoirs show us. 
This winter, temperatures will drop here and there. Some snow will fall. There will be days that feel like winter. But we’re past the point of comforting ourselves that these warm winter temperatures are an anomaly. They are our future. 
Decades ago, I rented an attic bedroom in a house in western Colorado from a woman who was kind and angry and trying very hard and battling demons. Because she had taped handwritten quotes inside the kitchen cabinet next to the sink, every time I reached inside, I would read them. There’s one quote from the late Joanna Macy I think of every day.  
“The point is not to save people. The point is to create the conditions for the possibility of grace.” 
The point right now isn’t to save the planet — or even ourselves or the more-than-human species we rely upon or love. The point is to create the conditions for the possibility of grace. The possibility of a climate-changed future in which all the best and most beautiful things about this Earth haven’t been traded away.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/dryriogrande.jpeg,,,2026-01-06 15:12:46.853577

About one-third of the petition pages submitted Dec. 9 won't be checked because the signatures were collected prior to Oct. 14 (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).Signatures on only two-thirds of the petition pages submitted to force a statewide vote on Missouri’s gerrymandered congressional map will go through the verification process, new filings in a Cole County court case show.
Secretary of State Denny Hoskins delivered 33,068 pages to local election authorities out of 49,773 pages with signatures collected by a political action committee called People Not Politicians. The PAC began circulating petitions after lawmakers passed the new map on Sept. 12. Those pages will be checked to determine which signatures are from registered voters.
Hoskins held back the rest because he does not believe signatures collected before Oct. 14 — the day he approved the form of the petition — are valid. Any pages with at least one signature dated Oct. 14 or later were sent to local election authorities, an exhibit included in the court filings state.
The filing is part of the case pending before Cole County Circuit Judge Christopher Limbaugh over which signatures must be counted. On Dec. 12, Limbaugh declared he would not issue a ruling until the verification process shows whether the referendum petition can succeed without signatures collected before Oct. 14.
People Not Politicians needs approximately 110,000 signatures spread among six of the state’s eight congressional districts to put the redistricting plan to a statewide vote. The 49,773 pages have 305,968 signatures overall, but the filings do not show how many signatures are on the pages being checked.
In other court filings, People Not Politicians has stated that about 103,000 of the signatures were collected before the cutoff date.
The raw signature counts — including the names on pages not sent for verification — show enough signatures were collected in the city of St. Louis to qualify the 1st District and enough in Greene County to qualify the 7th District. 
The data did not show the breakdown in split counties. There were 71,008 signatures submitted from St. Louis County, which is split between the 1st and 2nd districts. There were 59,823 signatures collected in Jackson County, which includes the 4th, 5th and 6th districts, and  30,110 signatures collected in Boone County, which is split between the 3rd and 4th districts.
The two districts where the petition is unlikely to have enough signatures are the 6th Congressional District in north Missouri and the 8th Congressional District in southeast Missouri.
The gerrymandered map was forced through by Republicans who succumbed to pressure from President Donald Trump and revised the eight districts during a September special session.
The intended result from the new map is to flip the 5th District to the GOP. The district, based in Kansas City, has been represented by Democratic U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver since 2005. 
The district is carved up under the new map with portions attached to the 4th and 6th Districts. Heavily Republican areas stretching along the Missouri River to Boone County would be added to the remaining Kansas City portions.
If the referendum has sufficient signatures, the map would be on the November ballot unless lawmakers set an earlier date.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Referendum-security-20251209-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-06 15:12:46.853577

Bounds is the institutional historian for the institution, Monday, Nov. 17, 2025.","The audio version of this story is AI generated and is not human reviewed. It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
For Alexis Dean, age 21, attending Tougaloo College is literally a dream come true.
The idea came to her in a dream. The dream worked out, and she’s now a senior music education major. There’s a lot of hands-on instruction, the teachers are supportive and she loves her classes, though the building where her classes are located might be considered nightmarish by some.
Ballard Hall is the home of Tougaloo’s music department and one of the oldest buildings on campus, but it’s in need of renovations after over a century of use.
“People are scared of this building,” Dean said. “They call it the haunted house because of how it looks on the outside.”
Tougaloo College is working to secure funding to save the historic Ballard Hall from disrepair.
C. Erskine Brown is the assistant vice president of facilities and real property management at Tougaloo. Brown explained that Tougaloo is preparing “a comprehensive preservation and rehabilitation effort” that is in line with preservation guidelines from the Mississippi Department of Archives and History and the National Park Service.
“Preserving this building is not simply a construction project,” Brown said. “It represents the safeguarding of Tougaloo’s legacy, identity and cultural heritage for generations to come.”
The building needs major repairs, including roof replacement, modernizing the HVAC system and interior rehabilitation. Efforts to secure funding for an engineer to survey the building for soundproofing and acoustic treatment are also ongoing.
Dr. Jessie Primer III, chair of Tougaloo’s music department, said the soundproofing and acoustic treatment is part of an effort to gain accreditation from the National Association of Schools of Music. This accreditation would bring the department up to national standards and improve recruitment.
Primer said the overall renovations would improve student morale.
“When alumni come back to visit on campus, they’re surprised to see that this old facility is still standing,” said Primer.
Tony Bounds, Tougaloo’s institutional historian,  explained that the building will become unusable without renovations, and that Toougaloo doesn’t have a place to relocate the music department. The music technology and audio principal labs have already been relocated to the Zenobia Coleman Library.
Bounds believes Ballard Hall is “a hidden gem,” which is why he nominated it to Mississippi Heritage Trust’s list of the “10 Most Endangered Historic Places in Mississippi.” The list raises awareness about places, buildings and things that may be lost to demolition, disrepair and other forces.
“You don’t find too many structures that remain that were actually funded directly by abolitionists, and Ballard Hall is a product of that era in American history,” Bounds said.
“I think that’s very important because it’s material culture. It’s something that we can actually still handle and see and study and delve into physically.”
Ballard Hall was constructed in 1886, mostly by students at the American Missionary Association, which established Tougaloo. It’s named after philanthropist and businessman Stephen Ballard, who contributed money to Black schools throughout the South. His $5,0000 donation was used to construct three buildings, and Ballard Hall is the only one that remains standing.
The 139 year-old building has been repurposed multiple times. It was a preparatory school, the home of Mississippi’s first accredited all-Black high school. It’s been the home of Tougaloo’s music department since 1957.
One of the notable moments from the history of Tougaloo’s music department and Ballard Hall occurred on April 4, 1968. The College’s choir and famed pianist and orchestra leader Duke Ellington had to stop their performance at Carnegie Hall in New York for Ellington and then-Tougaloo President George A. Owens to announce the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King.
In 1998, Ballard Hall and the rest of the Tougaloo College Historic District joined the National Register of Historic Places.
Brown explained the challenges faced getting funding: the work the building needs is expensive; the college has limited resources; state and federal preservation grants are very competitive; and there are few funding streams for historically Black colleges and universities for historic preservation.
The total renovation project is estimated to cost a little over $1 million, though the design team hasn’t provided a full schedule of costs yet. Once funding is secured, construction would take an estimated 12 to 18 months.
Bounds says Tougaloo is currently in talks with private funding entities that were recommended to the college by the Mississippi Heritage Trust.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/17151750/Ballard-Hall-2.jpg,,,2026-01-06 15:12:46.853577

(Photo by Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas State University has resolved a student complaint about the presence of diversity, equity and inclusion efforts within its student government following pressure from legislative leadership to investigate.
The Legislature passed a provision in 2025 requiring state agencies, including state universities, to eliminate DEI-related positions, mandates, programs, activities, training requirements, grants and contracts by Aug. 1.
Universities and agencies scrubbed their websites of DEI terminology, reassigned or eliminated staff positions, refocused clubs and departments, examined contracts and removed pronouns from email signatures.
But a student was not satisfied with K-State’s efforts and sent an anonymous report to legislative leadership in July outlining complaints. The Kansas Board of Regents, which oversees the state’s higher education institutions, informed K-State of potential issues within the university’s student government.
Among the issues was language within the university’s Student Governing Association’s constitution that required planning diversity training for student government members. The association also has power to allocate funds to clubs that could involve DEI-related topics. The student senate repealed the training requirement at its Sept. 4 meeting.
Marshall Stewart, chief of staff for K-State’s president, told the State Finance Council on Tuesday that K-State did not realize it was out of compliance at the time of the complaint and worked hard to course correct. The State Finance Council is made up of Gov. Laura Kelly and legislative leadership.
Stewart said students took the matter seriously and resolved to no longer disperse money or make appointments that could be in conflict with the state’s anti-DEI law.
“Universities are big, complex organizations, and I’m not going to say if you go deep enough and look hard enough you’re not going to find some things,” Stewart said. “But if you do find them, we ask that people share those with us.”
Young America’s Foundation, a conservative youth organization, complained to the U.S. Department of Education’s civil rights office in March that K-State’s wasn’t complying with federal anti-DEI efforts. The organization’s letter mentioned the Student Governing Association and other K-State departments by name. However, it did not produce a formal investigation, according to U.S. Department of Education records.
Tuesday’s issue is a carryover from that March complaint and the State Finance Council’s July meeting. Senate President Ty Masterson, an Andover Republican and candidate for governor, had charged state officials with investigating the anonymous report, which was sent to his office. 
Adam Proffitt, the secretary of administration, who must certify all agencies and universities are in compliance with the state’s anti-DEI law, presented his findings Tuesday to the council.
He said his legal team worked with K-State, and he was satisfied with the university’s updated report. Masterson commended the university’s effort but expressed interest in crafting additional anti-DEI provisions in the upcoming legislative session.
University leaders recently appeared before the House Committee on Government Efficiency to detail efforts to extricate DEI from college campuses. Legislators on the committee expressed interest in censoring related college curricula.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Masterson-9-Senate-3.26.25-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-06 14:58:01.637292

The remainder are offering foreign catch and failing to inform their customers about where it’s sourced. 
The test results show a significant disparity between establishments on the west bank versus those on the east bank that were found to have much higher authenticity rates for local shrimp. The results also depart from the high authenticity rates found two years ago among independent vendors at the Westwego Shrimp Lot, an open-air seafood market on the west bank.
The testing, performed by SeaD Consulting, analyzed genetic tissue of shrimp served at 24 restaurants randomly selected on the west bank of Jefferson, Orleans and Plaquemines parishes. Sixteen served locally caught seafood, while eight offered foreign, farm-raised shrimp while fraudulently presenting it as domestic catch. 
None of the eight restaurants had signage or menu language disclosing that they were serving imported seafood, as required under law. Seven businesses falsely labeled the imports as domestic, wild-caught shrimp on their menus or through verbal communications with SeaD’s undercover inspectors. One of the eight west bank restaurants had staff that didn’t know what kind of shrimp was being served, according to a news release issued Tuesday.
SeaD Consulting does not publicly identify the businesses that have violated the law, instead focusing on those who are in compliance.  
It is illegal under federal and state law to mislabel imported seafood as local and can result in heavy fines or other penalties, including prison time for some federal cases. 
There have been 2,600 violations of Louisiana’s imported shrimp law — and no fines

For more than a decade, Louisiana law has required restaurants and other food establishments to state on their menus the country of origin of any shrimp and crawfish being served. The same requirement applies to food vendors at fairs and festivals. 
Local seafood was once easy to find in Louisiana, but an influx of cheap foreign catch — particularly shrimp and crawfish — has flooded the market over the past two decades. 
In December 2024, the Louisiana Shrimp Task Force, an advisory panel for the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, asked SeaD Consulting to analyze shrimp from restaurants across the state in an effort to eliminate consumer seafood fraud. Its analysis includes sampling 24 randomly selected restaurants in different metropolitan areas across the state. The company shares the results with the Louisiana Department of Health, which has authority to enforce the state shrimp labeling laws at restaurants. 
“When the local shrimp is so abundant, there’s no excuse not to serve them,” Shrimp Task Force Chairman Andrew Blanchard said in the release. 
SeaD Consulting is a food safety technology company that developed a rapid seafood species identification test. Dave Williams, a fisheries scientist and Houston resident, developed the process in collaboration with Florida State University microbiologist Prashant Singh. Over the past two years, SeaD has made headlines for uncovering foreign-sourced shrimp sold fraudulently as local catch at restaurants and festivals across the Gulf Coast.

(Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)Shootings in New Jersey hit a record low last year, for the third year in a row, state officials announced Tuesday.
They said 559 people were shot in 487 incidents last year, down from 778 in 2024 and 924 in 2023.
Before 2023, the number of shooting victims had topped 1,000 every year, annually averaging about 1,300, since officials began tracking gun violence statewide in 2009, Attorney General Matt Platkin said. Atlantic City, Camden, Newark, Paterson, and Trenton all saw their shooting numbers drop, officials said.
The lethality of gun violence also fell, with 107 fatalities reported last year. That’s down 31% from 2024 and more than 60% from 2016, when 273 people were shot to death in the deadliest year for gun violence since 2009, officials said.
NJ’s attorney general says he hasn’t ‘shied away’ from tough fights

“Just a few years ago, many experts — and by the way, yours truly — said getting below 1,000 shootings in a year was impossible. But we did it, and then we went further, nearly cutting that number in half,” Gov. Phil Murphy said during the announcement in East Rutherford.
Murphy and other state officials credited the drop to the state’s famously tough gun laws, street teams that work to de-escalate community tensions and reduce violence, interventions like Arrive Together that pair police with mental health professionals to respond to calls, and better data tracking that ensures “an intelligence-led strategy” to cutting gun crime.
“We are not just reacting to crime. We are identifying it, targeting it, and preventing it,” acting Superintendent Lt. Col. David Sierotowicz said. “Our real-time crime centers and gunfire detection technology and other surveillance techniques allow us to identify shootings as they occur in real time, rapidly deploy resources, and provide investigators with critical information to identify both suspects and victims.”
New Jersey also has seen “a meaningful drop in auto thefts, a crime that too often escalates into other forms of violence,” Murphy noted. The number of vehicles stolen statewide fell 9% from 15,041 in 2024 to 13,693 last year, according to the New Jersey State Police.

Pittman, the founder and executive director of Recidivism Reduction Educational Program Services, Inc. (RREPS), was sent to prison at age 18 and served 11 years and six months for conspiracy to commit murder. January 26 will mark eight years since his release and return to the Southeast Raleigh community in which he was reared. 
“I started a nonprofit when I came home and began advocating for individuals coming out of the [incarceration] system but I also put in programming to try to help them reintegrate into society with a little more ease,” Pittman said.
His experience behind bars gave him insight into what other formerly incarcerated individuals needed after they left prison.
“I had family support, so I had housing. but a lot of my friends didn’t have any place to go. Or if they did, there was a time limit on how long they could stay,” Pittman said.
Pittman’s purchase of the abandoned, 400-bed prison is an extension of the work he started soon after he left prison. He plans to create re-entry housing and a workforce campus where formerly incarcerated people can attain job skills or industry certifications.
“The campus would be like a stabilization phase for guys coming out of jail or prison, to give them a six-month pause so they can get their life back on track,” Pittman said. 
Pittman estimates it will take up to two years to get the former prison ready for as many as 300 residents who would live on the campus until they completed the six months-long program. Another class of up to 300 would replace the previous residents each six months, he said.  
He envisions residents studying and training to become electricians, plumbers, HVAC technicians, construction workers and other trades that are in high demand.
“Right now, not only in the United States, but particularly North Carolina and particularly rural North Carolina, they are experiencing a decline [in people] seeking trade jobs,” Pittman said.
Other residents might choose a track to earn industry certifications or a Commercial Driver’s License, he said. 
The program will be open to previously incarcerated individuals from across the state, Pittman said.
“We’ll take referrals, we’ll have a case management team that go inside the jails and prison … and then we’ll go and see if the candidate is the best fit for our program,” Pittman said. 
Pittman said it would make sense to locate such a facility in Goldsboro even if the former prison wasn’t available.
“Goldsboro is suffering right now with the plague of not only violence, but also poverty,” Pittman said. “It only made sense when this institution came up for sale to purchase it because of all of the other things that are going on in Eastern North Carolina, but also in that area.”
Pittman said he bought the former prison for under a million dollars and projects it will take about $2 million to refurbish it, while taking care to ensure it no longer looks like a prison. Pittman will rely heavily on private donations to fund the enterprise but has not ruled out pursuing local, state or federal funding.
The prison closed in 2013 as North Carolina sought to save money by reducing prison capacity after inmate populations declined.

Wayne County Commissioner Bevan Foster had not heard about the project but was excited after a reporter shared the news.
“If he’s able to do what he said he’s gonna do, it’d be great,” Foster said. “It’s the kind of program we need.”
Foster noted the irony of the prison being repurposed to help formerly incarcerated individuals.
“They’re using it for some good,” Foster said. “It would be a great thing.”
Wayne County Commissioner Antonio Williams also had not heard about Pittman’s proposal but said it would be a “wonderful opportunity” for people leaving prison.

“You can look around and see a lot of people who have been rehabilitated, but they come home and it’s challenging for them to even have housing, it’s challenging for them to find a job,” Williams said.
Many formerly incarcerated individuals return home to find that relatives or other loved ones have died or they’ve just lost those relationships while they were away and don’t have any place to go, Williams said.
“Pittman’s proposal, he said, “would definitely give them a chance to rejoin life and get the basic steps in order such as finding jobs, housing and health care, all of those things that are valuable and have meaning.” 
As NC Newsline previously reported, a year ago, Pittman launched the state’s first mobile reentry service center to bring resources and support to people reentering society from prison. He followed up with a second mobile center six months later.
The centers provide previously incarcerated people with case management and other services such as job placement, housing assistance, mental health support and help obtaining important documents such as identification.

(Keila Szpaller/The Daily Montanan)A group of conservation organizations said U.S. Critical Materials presented a “bad faith” proposal for “a mining plan” in the Sheep Creek area — not just an “exploration” plan as the company describes.
A letter Monday from the groups to the Bitterroot National Forest asks the U.S. Forest Service to reject the operations plan to look for valuable minerals at the headwaters of the Bitterroot River.
The letter is signed by 21 conservation and planning organizations, some focused on the Bitterroot Valley and others focused on Montana or specific issues.
Signers include Friends of the Bitterroot, MPG Ranch, Ravalli County Fish and Wildlife Association, Bitterroot River Protection Association, Montana Environmental Information Center, Alliance for the Wild Rockies, Wild Earth Guardians and Center for Biological Diversity.
The West Fork Ranger District office was closed Monday and a spokesperson could not be reached for comment in time for this story.
U.S. Critical Materials, a privately held company with an interest in mine exploration, has proposed a controversial 3.9 acre project to look for “rare earth” minerals to see if a fullscale mine is feasible. Company representatives have said the operation would support the local economy and national security.
But members of the public have raised numerous concerns including a lack of transparency on the part of company representatives, the environmentally sensitive nature of the site, and the potential for impacts to the entire watershed, especially on water.
After public outcry at a packed December meeting at the Hamilton fairgrounds, Ravalli County Commissioners sent letters to members of the Congressional delegation asking the project to be removed from the FAST-41 list of federal projects to be expedited.
FAST stands for Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act. Title 41 aims to streamline infrastructure projects related to energy, pipelines and other areas including mining.
Monday, the project still was listed on the federal FAST-41 dashboard as a priority in Montana.
Members of the congressional delegation sent their own letter to the Forest Service urging it to ensure transparency from U.S. Critical Materials. Earlier, U.S. Sen. Tim Sheehy and U.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke explicitly called for the project’s removal from the FAST-41 list.
As chief among their concerns, members of the public and county commissioners have cited a lack of public engagement by U.S. Critical Materials, which states on its website that it is headquartered in Salt Lake City and has a mission to reduce foreign reliance of imports.
Rare earth elements are key ingredients used in everyday products such as cell phones and cars.
Ravalli County Commission Chairperson Dan Huls said Monday county commissioners have yet to hear from U.S. Critical Materials since the December meeting, and they too want more information from the company, especially about projected truck traffic.
The letter Monday from the conservation groups outlines multiple concerns, including that the plan of operation by U.S. Critical Materials is “missing basic critical information” and would require a full environmental impact statement as opposed to a less exhaustive environmental assessment.
“Among the numerous omissions and ploys we note, there is no discussion about testing for asbestos, a potentially immediate human health issue, and no plans to mitigate foreseeable impacts of toxins like arsenic, thorium, lead or possible asbestos,” the letter said.
U.S. Critical Materials could not be reached for comment through a voicemail left Monday afternoon.
The letter also said the project is designed to allow U.S. Critical Materials to ignore waste from the site — “and they already are ignoring it.”
The plan proposes to transfer excess waste “to a containment pad and then offsite via truck to be utilized in gravel production or backfill unrelated to the proposed site activities,” the letter said. It said that could spread toxic contamination, as happened in Ravalli County with Curlew Mine waste, and it raises another concern.
“This seems to be a cynical ploy to stay within a five-acre limit to surface disturbance,” the letter said.
The Bitterroot Star reported that old tailings from the Curlew Mine near Victor were used for graveling roads and even as fill for stream culverts by the Ravalli County Road Department, and a study linked lead contamination to the mine.
At the Sheep Creek site, the letter said waste is a significant issue.
It said mining a mile-long 12-by-12 foot tunnel will require more than an equally large space for storage — “think pulling a sleeping bag out of its stuff sack. The waste will be bigger than the hole it came out of.”
And the waste disposal is related to the mining and needs to be evaluated as a “foreseeable, connected, cumulative impact,” the letter said.
It said storage also is a problem.
“Storing rock inside the mine tunnel, which could be flooded with groundwater, looks like a recipe for a toxic stew of assorted minerals leaching off finely fractured rock surfaces into the water drainage,” the letter said. “We have no idea how the stew will turn out.”
Chairman Huls said the county still is missing important information from U.S. Critical Materials.
For example, he said the county commissioners have no idea if the project in its production or exploration phase would mean 10 trucks or 20 or 30 in any time period.
But the county is responsible for many of the roads leading to the site, he said, and more trucks mean more use, more traffic and budget implications.
“Frankly without a large infusion of cash, we can’t improve those roads as it is,” Huls said.
Since the December meeting, Huls said the county has continued to hear from the public. He estimated 99% of the comments are opposed to fast-tracking the project and oppose the mine altogether, although he said a couple of callers said it presents an opportunity.
Huls said the county commissioners are monitoring the situation and will continue to do so.
“While we do as a commission support the extraction of critical materials, we think there are lots of better opportunities, and we don’t think the sensitivity of the environment where this proposed mine is can be healthy for our economy here in the Bitterroot — and especially with the potential environmental hazards that it possesses,” Huls said.

(Provided by MSU for the Daily Montanan.)The last time Montana State University football team claimed a national championship, U.S. Sen. Steve Daines was graduating from the school, in 1984.
“What a time to be a Bobcat!” Daines wrote in a social media post on X last night from Nashville, where he was in attendance to witness MSU pull off an incredibly exciting overtime victory over Illinois State, 35-34.
Also in attendance supporting Montana State’s run to the top of the FCS was Gov. Greg Gianforte and U.S. Sen. Tim Sheehy.

“What a game! Bobcats are the National Champs. So proud!” Gianforte wrote on X, along with photos of himself and his wife celebrating the win on the field.
The Bobcats returned to the FCS championship game for the third time in five years, after losing a close game 35-32 to North Dakota State University.
At the start of this season’s playoffs, NDSU was ranked No. 1, with the Bobcats entering as the No. 2 ranked team following their Big Sky Conference title earned in a Brawl of the Wild win against the University of Montana.
The Cats earned their championship berth with a second victory over the Griz in a semifinal game on Dec. 20, setting the stage for a trip to Nashville to take on Illinois State.
MSU jumped to an early lead in the game, with quarterback Justin Lamson rushing three yards to put points on the board first.
Another rush by Lamson in the second quarter put MSU up by 14 before the Redbirds finally responded with their own touchdown.
The teams continued back and forth with MSU always holding the lead until the fourth quarter, when the Redbirds reached the endzone twice, tying the game at 28 with just over five minutes on the clock.
The momentum seemed to be with Illinois State, as the Bobcats saw a three-and-out that gave the Redbirds the ball, and they drove deep into Bobcats territory with a chance to kick a field goal for the win with a minute to go.
But a block by Bobcats cornerback Jhase McMillan ended that dream, and gave the Bobcats their own chance to end the game in regulation time.
Instead, a bad snap sent the ball over Lamson’s head and gave the chance right back to Illinois State, which sent the game into overtime, a first for an FCS championship.
The Redbirds kept up their second-half momentum by scoring in two plays in OT, on a 10-yard pass from quarterback Tommy Rittenhouse.
It wasn’t enough, however, as once again, an MSU player blocked the additional point.
The Bobcats marched back down into Illinois State territory and Lamson landed a 14-yard pass to Taco Dowler for the touchdown, and the point after by Myles Sansted clinched the game.

The beauty of sports is overwhelming sometimes.
What a game. What a season. What a memory.

The proposal is part of a larger effort to reform Maine’s overburdened indigent defense system, which courts have ruled is in violation of defendants’ Sixth Amendment rights. 
Last session, several bills were proposed to reduce the number of cases brought to the courts in order to alleviate the backlog. Most did not pass, though some were carried over to this session.
The bill, LD 449, sponsored by Rep. David Sinclair (D-Bath), would allow first-time criminal defendants to file a motion for conditional discharge as an alternative sentencing option. 
Only those convicted of the less serious crimes (classes C, D, and E) would be eligible if they have not been previously convicted of a serious offense. 
The Maine Commission on Public Defense Services supported the bill, arguing it would help reduce the number of criminal cases, as hundreds of indigent defendants wait for court-appointed attorneys.
“Right now, we have a very, very significant backlog of cases,” said Frayla Tarpinian, the new executive director of the Maine Commission on Public Defense Services, told lawmakers during a Judiciary Committee work session Tuesday. “And it’s really taxing everybody who’s involved in the system: the court, the courts, the prosecutors, defense attorney resources. And so establishing narrow places where judges can intervene and off-ramp cases… could help alleviate some of that burden.”
But prosecutors raised issues with the proposal’s potential to increase the number of motions filed, saying it would burden the courts. 
Shira Burns, executive director of the Maine Prosecutors Association, told the committee that the bill also fails to consider the impact conditional discharge would have on victim rights, particularly in domestic violence cases. Burns argued the bill is too broad, and does not prevent repeat offenders from filing motions of conditional discharge — even if they may not be eligible for it.
Committee co-chair Sen. Anne Carney (D-Cumberland) echoed Burns’ concerns, pointing out that the proposal, carried over from last session, could have been amended to address those issues, but wasn’t. She also noted the overlap with another reform that recently took effect that allows prosecutors to charge certain Class E crimes as civil violations.
Carney previously told Maine Morning Star that she wasn’t sure whether it is possible to make the changes proposed in LD 449 to the state criminal code, although she said the proposal is “trying to get at that same concern: that we’re spending more resources charging and prosecuting people than we need to spend, in order to achieve the rehabilitative purpose of the criminal code.”
With the committee unanimously opposed, the legislation has little chance of passing the full Legislature and will likely be rejected without a roll call vote. However, members of the Judiciary Committee will consider several other reforms to the indigent defense system in the coming weeks.

Jeff Landry speaks in the Louisiana House of Representatives on the opening day of a legislative special session, Nov. 6, 2024, at the State Capitol in Baton Rouge. (Hilary Scheinuk/The Advocate, Pool)Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry wrote in an opinion column he believes captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro should be put to death for his alleged drug-related crimes. 
“Personally, I’d like to see Maduro executed for the crimes he has committed against the people of the United States and the families left to mourn,” Landry wrote for the right-leaning news outlet Breitbart. “However, I would be well satisfied to see him and his wife spend the rest of their days at Camp 57 in Angola.” 
Camp 57 is an Immigrations and Customs Enforcement-run facility Landry set up at Louisiana State Penitentiary in Angola. Landry named the site in honor of himself, the 57th governor of Louisiana. 
Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were captured by American forces last week after an attack on Caracas, the capital of Venezuela. They were brought to New York, where they face federal drug trafficking and other charges. The couple pleaded not guilty. 
“Since 2015, over 800,000 Americans have died from opioid overdoses. The vast majority of those cases are from fentanyl, a drug that makes its way into the United States through various drug cartels,” Landry wrote. “One of the largest in the world was the illegitimate government of Venezuela, run by indicted criminal Nicolás Maduro.” 

“Because of the actions of the president of the United States and the world’s finest military force, he will be brought to justice,” Landry continued. 
Federal law enforcement agencies attribute the bulk of illegal fentanyl shipments into the U.S. from China and Mexico.
President Donald Trump has said the United States will run Venezuela, and American oil companies will increase their operations in the country. In Maduro’s absence, Vice President Delcy Rodríguez has been sworn in as acting president. 
Landry believes Trump’s plans for Venezuela will be economically beneficial for Louisiana. 
“Our ports will be key logistics bases for the rejuvenation of the Venezuelan oil and gas industry,” Landry wrote. “Our oil and gas companies will see tremendous opportunities in this process. More importantly, our people will find high-paying jobs in support of this effort.”

The New Mexico Department of Justice said Jan. 5, 2026, it is “reviewing” the legality of a recent ICE detention contract extension. (Patrick Lohmann/Source NM).The New Mexico Department of Justice is reviewing whether the Torrance County Commission violated the state Open Meetings Act last week when it quickly approved a contract extension enabling a federal agency to continue housing immigrant detainees at a local jail, an NMDOJ spokesperson told Source New Mexico. 
The commission met for only a few minutes Dec. 30 and voted without debate or public comment to extend the contract between the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency and CoreCivic, which owns and operates the Torrance County Detention Facility in Estancia. Before commissioners met last week, the contract had been defunct for two months.
The contract extension to March 31 of this year increased the monthly payment ICE makes to the county to roughly $2.4 million, funding the county then passes on to CoreCivic. The parties also backdated the contract to Nov. 1, 2025, the date the original contract expired.
The meeting between Christmas and New Year’s Day to extend a backdated contract has piqued the interest of the New Mexico Department of Justice, according to spokesperson Chelsea Pitvorec.
50 NM immigrant detainees say mail issues at jail hurting their legal cases  

“The information surrounding the December 30 meeting raises real concern regarding backdating a contract, compliance with the New Mexico procurement code, and whether the Open Meetings Act was complied with,” Pitvorec told Source in an email Monday evening. “NMDOJ has authority over local government compliance with the Open Meetings Act, and we intend to gather more facts and review what transpired in accordance with State law.”
Ian Philabaum, a program director for Innovation Law Lab, an Oregon-based immigrant legal advocacy group that does weekly jail visits, told Source New Mexico last week that he was concerned county officials did not provide adequate notice about the meeting. 
The county’s 2025 Open Meetings Act resolution requires county commissions holding “special meetings” like the one last week to provide public notice at least 72 hours in advance to an area newspaper and a television or radio station.
In response to questions from Source NM, Torrance County Manager Jordan Barela did not directly address whether the county had provided that notice, though he said in an email county officials published notice on its website about the meeting on Dec. 26. 
“This means that the notice was posted in excess of 96 hours before the date of the meeting. In addition, this meet[ing] was posted in the same form and manner as all other special meetings conducted by the County Commission,” he said via email Monday. 
He also said it’s common practice for the commission not to allow public comment in special meetings where there is only one agenda item.

Leaders in the House and Senate could not agree on a general operating budget in 2025. With the chambers divided over the state’s planned income tax cuts and how much to increase pay for state workers and teachers, they left town with negotiations in a holding pattern until this year’s short session.
In the meantime, much of state government has been running on a continuation of the 2024 budget. Republican legislative leaders say that level of funding is adequate, but agency heads on both sides of the aisle disagree.
Democratic Secretary of State Elaine Marshall told the governor and other members of the council that more than 172,000 new businesses were created in North Carolina last year, nearly 10,000 more than in 2024.
While the growth has been remarkable, Marshall said on Tuesday, it was disappointing that her calls for additional personnel within the agency have fallen on deaf ears at the legislature.
“I sat at this very seat in August of ’23 asking the General Assembly for help,” said Marshall. “Two years later, that help has still not come. This is now our second year without a new state budget.”
The workload at the Secretary of State’s office has essentially doubled since 2017, yet staffing levels have remained largely unchanged, Marshall said. The agency has implemented technology improvements to manage a flood of new filings, but technology alone cannot solve every issue.
“People are essential,” said Marshall.
State Insurance Commissioner Mike Causey said his agency was understaffed for the amount of work investigators are asked to do. (Photo: NC Council of State livestream)
But Marshall said her employees are the second lowest paid employees in state government.
“We’ve consistently communicated to the General Assembly leadership the need for additional staff positions. While there’s growing awareness on Jones Street, the reality remains that there has been no budget,” she said.
State Insurance Commissioner Mike Causey, a Republican, joined Marshall in criticizing the failure of lawmakers to address the state’s budgetary needs.
Causey said his department’s team of 50 criminal investigators was called to investigate more than 7,600 cases of possible insurance fraud in 2025.
“Last year, these teams made 380 arrests,” said Causey. “We’re still only scratching the surface when it comes to fighting fraud.”
From 2017 to 2025, the Department of Insurance recovered over $76.6 million for people who were victimized by insurance fraud, according to the commissioner.
Governor Josh Stein said the lack of a comprehensive budget is hurting state employees and teachers. (Photo: NC Council of State livestream)
“I don’t think there’s an agency here that couldn’t use more staffing,” said Causey. “But both the Senate and the House, when they came out with their proposed budgets, were asking us as a self-funded agency to cut 20 positions or $2 million from our budget at a time when we need to be adding that many [positions] or more.”
Governor Josh Stein empathized with both agency heads and echoed their call for state legislators to get moving and pass a comprehensive budget that should have been in place last July.
“We have public safety officers who are not paid well. We have teachers who are earning less money on a real basis today than they were a year ago,” lamented Stein.
The governor noted that North Carolina ranks 48th in per-pupil spending and 50th in the country in terms of funding effort of K-12 education.
“These are numbers in which we can take no pride,” said Stein. “The legislature needs to pass a budget. I’m at the table ready to get to work whenever they are.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Marshall_1-6-2026.jpg,,,2026-01-06 13:57:34.699472

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Monday recommended that the previous number of childhood vaccines of 17 be reduced to just 11 vaccinations.
In a statement issued Tuesday, Dr. Natasha Bagdasarian, Michigan’s chief medical executive, said that the new changes may create confusion for families and clinicians in terms of school vaccine requirements, clinical workflows and the supply and use of combination vaccines.
“[The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services] will continue to provide clear guidance, backed by science, to help protect Michigan families,” Bagdasarian said.
The new schedule is specifically suggesting tighter restrictions on vaccines for rotavirus, hepatitis A and B, meningitis and seasonal influenza, recommending that those vaccines only be given to children with high medical risk or at the recommendation of a pediatrician or health care provider.
NPR reported that those vaccines now exist in a category designated as “shared-decision making.”
The move follows U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s missives on the federal government reevaluating the number of vaccines given to children and their effectiveness, which follow his long history of questioning vaccines and their disproven ties to autism and unsubstantiated connections to other disorders.
Schedule changes issued Monday by Jim O’Neil, the deputy secretary in Kennedy’s agency, were the product of consultation with National Institutes of Health Director Jay Bhattacharya, Food and Drug Commissioner. Marty Makary, and U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Mehmet Oz, as well as the health ministries of what the agency described as peer nations.
Recommended for all children are vaccines for measles, mumps, rubella, polio, pertussis, tetanus, diphtheria, Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib), pneumococcal disease, human papillomavirus (HPV), and varicella (chickenpox).
In response, Bagdasarian said that the underlying scientific evidence surrounding vaccine effectiveness remains unchanged, and that the state will continue to follow guidance produced either by the American Academy of Pediatrics or the American Academy of Family Physicians.
Bagdasarian in December 2025 issued a standing recommendation to follow that guidance despite whatever changes the federal government made regarding the vaccine schedule, and she stands by the recommendation.
Both the state’s health department and the federal health agency have said that all vaccines, including those moved to shared clinical decision-making category, will remain covered with no out-of-pocket cost via Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act-regulated private insurance plans and federal coverage programs such as Medicaid and the Vaccines for Children program.
U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham), who has become one of Kennedy’s foremost critics in Congress, said in a statement that the agency’s move was part of why she has called for his impeachment.
“RFK Jr. is ignoring decades of reliable science and making our children less safe — this is the latest step,” Stevens said. “The Secretary of Health and Human Services is supposed to protect the health of the American people. Instead, at every turn, RFK Jr. actively chooses to make our country sicker.”
Stevens added that Kennedy’s “conspiracy agenda is dangerous and unacceptable.”

California es uno de los 32 estados que no exige que los niños de 5 años asistan a la escuela.



This article is also available in English. Read it here.
En los últimos años, California se ha centrado en el ABC, el 1-2-3 y las ruedas del autobús, invirtiendo más de 5 mil millones de dólares en educación de la primera infancia.
Pero el kínder, un elemento básico de las escuelas primarias durante más de un siglo, sigue siendo opcional. A pesar de casi media docena de intentos legislativos para hacerlo obligatorio, California es uno de los 32 estados que no exige que todos los niños de 5 años asistan a la escuela.
Eso podría cambiar en el 2026. Los legisladores planean presentar un nuevo proyecto de ley para exigir la educación preescolar y confían en que tendrá mejor suerte que sus predecesores, que fracasaron en comisión o fueron vetados, en gran medida debido a su costo.
 “Los niños necesitan estar rodeados de otros niños, necesitan aprender. Es importante”, dijo Patricia Lozano, directora ejecutiva de Early Edge California, organización que aboga por la educación infantil temprana. “No veo por qué California no puede lograrlo”.
Los datos, según los activistas, son contundentes. Los niños que asisten al kínder obtienen mejores resultados en matemáticas y lectura a partir del tercer grado, y mayores tasas de graduación de la preparatoria. También tienen menos probabilidades de ser suspendidos o abandonar la escuela más adelante.
 ¿Por qué algunos padres optan por no participar?
Si bien California exige que todos los distritos escolares ofrezcan kínder, no obliga a las familias a matricular a sus hijos. La mayoría lo hace, pero aproximadamente un 5% al año opta por no inscribir a sus hijos. Las razones varían: algunas familias creen que los niños no están preparados para los rigores de la escuela, mientras que otras están satisfechas con la situación actual de sus hijos, ya sea preescolar, guardería o quedarse en casa con la familia.
Las familias latinas son las menos propensas a enviar a sus hijos al kínder, según los datos. Lozano explicó que esto se debe a diversas razones: o bien no lo saben debido a la barrera del idioma; o bien tienen miedo de inscribir a sus hijos en la escuela por preocupaciones migratorias; o bien los padres trabajan tanto que no recibieron las notificaciones del distrito escolar; o bien una combinación de las tres. En cualquier caso, las escuelas necesitan mejorar su acercamiento a esa comunidad, afirmó.
 Cecelia Kiss, maestra bilingüe de kínder del Distrito Escolar Unificado de la Ciudad de Sacramento, comentó que recientemente tuvo una alumna cuya madre fue deportada, y la niña no pudo asistir a la escuela porque no había nadie disponible para llevarla. Aunque le encantaba la escuela y la familia valoraba mucho la educación, era logísticamente imposible llevarla a la escuela. La escuela y la familia tardaron varias semanas en organizar el transporte.
“Para los latinos, la educación es fundamental. Queremos darles a nuestros hijos lo mejor posible”, dijo Kiss, quien también es madre de un niño de kínder. “Pero a veces no podemos con todo. Confiamos en maestros bondadosos que cuiden a nuestros hijos, que los ayuden a aprender y que los preparen para el primer grado”.
 La senadora estatal Susan Rubio afirmó que el hecho de que el kínder no sea obligatorio desalienta a las familias ya desfavorecidas a matricular a sus hijos. En su experiencia, las familias latinas tienen un gran respeto por el sistema escolar público, y si este les dice que el kínder es opcional y, por lo tanto, no es una prioridad, “lo escuchan”.
Por eso ha propuesto dos proyectos de ley anteriores para hacer obligatorio el kínder. El estado debe transmitir a las familias un mensaje claro: la educación en la primera infancia es esencial para el éxito escolar y personal de los estudiantes, afirmó. El estado  de California ya ha implementado el kínder de transición para todos los niños de 4 años, ha ampliado la educación preescolar financiada por el estado y ha añadido más plazas a su programa de guarderías subvencionadas. El siguiente paso debería ser reforzar el kínder, añadió.
El superintendente estatal de Instrucción Pública, Tony Thurmond, coincide con esta apreciación. Este mes, declaró que la obligatoriedad del kínder es una prioridad legislativa para 2026 y se comprometió a apoyar cualquier proyecto de ley que lo aborde. Varios legisladores afirmaron que considerarían patrocinar uno.
‘No es una necesidad urgente’
 Los dos proyectos de ley anteriores de Rubio sobre jardines de infancia fracasaron: uno en el Comité de Asignaciones del Senado y el otro cuando el gobernador Gavin Newsom lo vetó. En su nota de veto, afirmó que apoya la educación temprana en general, pero que el estado no había presupuestado el costo, estimado en 268 millones de dólares anuales.
 “Si bien la intención del autor es loable… es importante mantener la disciplina en lo que respecta al gasto, particularmente el gasto continuo”, escribió Newsom.
 Numerosos grupos apoyaron los proyectos de ley, incluyendo la Asociación de Maestros de California (el sindicato de docentes más grande del estado) y varios distritos escolares. Sin embargo, tuvo algunos oponentes, en particular la Asociación de Educación en el Hogar de California. La oposición del grupo no se basaba en las ventajas del kínder en sí, sino en la capacidad del estado para despojar de derechos a los padres.
 “La mayoría de los niños ya van al kínder. Pero algunos padres tienen buenas razones para dejar a sus hijos en casa”, dijo Jamie Heston, miembro de la junta directiva del grupo. “Los padres quieren tener la opción de decidir qué es lo mejor para sus hijos”.
 La Asociación de Contribuyentes Howard Jarvis no se ha pronunciado al respecto, pero en general se opone a las nuevas iniciativas que cuestan dinero, como la educación preescolar obligatoria. Es improbable que esta postura cambie si resurge un proyecto de ley sobre educación preescolar, declaró esta semana la vicepresidenta del grupo, Susan Shelley.
 “Desde un punto de vista presupuestario, este año hay mucha presión para mantener el gasto bajo control”, dijo Shelley. “Este no sería un gasto único. Sería continuo. Y no hay una necesidad urgente de ampliar el jardín de infantes, en comparación con otras necesidades más apremiantes que enfrenta el estado en este momento”.
Bruce Fuller, profesor de educación en la Universidad de California en Berkeley y especialista en educación infantil temprana, afirmó que la Legislatura debería centrarse en las necesidades más urgentes de los menores de 6 años. Entre ellas se incluye cómo la implementación del kínder de transición ha provocado el cierre de muchos centros preescolares, dejando a muchos niños de 3 años sin lugares de cuidado diario. Además, Head Start enfrenta dificultades financieras y otros obstáculos impuestos por la administración Trump, incluyendo intentos de excluir a familias no ciudadanas. Y aunque California ha ampliado el acceso a la educación preescolar financiada por el estado, no hay suficientes familias que sepan que son elegibles.
“No hay tantas familias optando por no asistir al kínder, así que no es una gran necesidad”, dijo Fuller. “Hay preocupaciones más inmediatas”. 
 Brechas de aprendizaje entre los estudiantes
Aun así, Rubio confía en que un proyecto de ley sobre jardín de infantes tiene buenas posibilidades de aprobarse este año, en gran parte porque la Legislatura ha experimentado una rotación significativa desde la última vez que votó sobre un proyecto de ley sobre educación preescolar en 2024. Veintisiete nuevos senadores y miembros de la Asamblea fueron elegidos el otoño pasado.
Para Rubio, cuyos padres emigraron de México, el asunto es personal. Aunque a ella le fue bien en la escuela, a su hermano gemelo no. A temprana edad, lo asignaron erróneamente a educación especial, se retrasó y tuvo dificultades durante toda su etapa escolar, hasta que finalmente abandonó los estudios. Rubio cree que le habría ido mejor si hubiera recibido una educación infantil de alta calidad.
Ella también es maestra de primaria y ha visto la brecha entre los estudiantes que han asistido a preescolar, kínder tradicional y jardín de infancia, y aquellos que nunca se matricularon en la escuela hasta primer grado. Los niños que han asistido a jardín de infancia saben sostener un lápiz, escribir sus nombres, contar hasta 20, esperar por su turno y quizás incluso leer o hacer cálculos matemáticos básicos, comentó. Los que no han asistido se quedan muy atrás de sus compañeros y algunos nunca se ponen al día, añadió.
 “Tengo recuerdos muy vívidos de mis alumnos rompiendo a llorar al final del año porque no pudieron hacer un examen. No sabían las respuestas, y es muy doloroso verlo”, dijo Rubio, quien está de licencia en su trabajo como maestra en el Distrito Escolar Unificado de Monrovia, en el condado de Los Ángeles. “Es duro para ellos y para los maestros, porque esos niños necesitan mucha ayuda adicional”.
 Lozano dijo que cree que el proyecto de ley se aprobará con el tiempo. La iniciativa costaría dinero, pero el estado ahorraría dinero a largo plazo si más estudiantes tuvieran éxito en la escuela y se graduaran.
 “Nos llevó 20 años conseguir el TK. Se necesita tiempo para cambiar de opinión y de políticas”, dijo Lozano. “El kínder ofrece muchísimos beneficios, especialmente para los niños que más lo necesitan. Creemos que los beneficios superan los costos”.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/032723-Buttonwillow-LV_CM_15.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-06 13:57:34.699472

On Dec. 30, U.S. Deputy Secretary of Health and Human Services Jim O’Neill announced on X that the Administration of Children and Families will now “require a justification and a receipt or photo evidence” before it will send money to a state for child care purposes. 
The Administration of Children and Families oversees the distribution of federal child care funds to states. It administers funding from the Child Care and Development Block Grant and the Child Care and Development Fund, or CCDF. 
In New Hampshire, the fund and grant bankroll the Bureau of Child Development and Head Start, the Child Care Scholarship Program, mental health and substance misuse programs, and other initiatives. New Hampshire received over $28 million in CCDF funds in the grant year 2025. 
The announcement comes after a video from a right-wing social media influencer went viral, claiming there is widespread fraud in Somali-run day care programs in Minnesota. As a result, the Trump administration froze all child care payments to Minnesota and announced that all states must produce funding receipts. 
As of Tuesday, the federal Department of Health and Human Services has frozen over $10 billion in funding — specifically for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, CCDF, and the Social Services Block Grant — in New York, California, Illinois, and Colorado, in addition to Minnesota. 
Josh Corbett, spokesperson for New Hampshire Gov. Kelly Ayotte, said the governor’s office had not received any notice from the federal government about a pause in child care funding as of Monday. 
O’Neill said that funds will be released “only when states prove they are being spent legitimately.”
To receive CCDF funding, the state submits biennial plans and quality progress reports. The federal government has not specified what additional documentation could be required to keep funding available. 
Freezing federal dollars could significantly impact Granite State families and child care providers across the state. As of November 2025, 4,976 children were actively using the Child Care Scholarship Program.
While the program is funded through both federal and state dollars, the majority of funding comes from the federal government. 
Additionally, a pilot program began on Jan. 1 that would allow scholarship applicants to be presumed eligible and receive scholarship funds for the program while completing their applications. 
The state Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to questions about how a pause in federal funding could impact either initiative. 
Meanwhile, the Trump administration continues to make changes to child care subsidies. 
On Monday, U.S. Health and Human Services rescinded rules from 2024 that required states to pay providers before verifying any attendance and before care was delivered. Under the new rule changes, attendance-based billing will be restored, upfront payments will no longer be required, and voucher flexibility for parental choice will be restored. 
In the press release, O’Neill said that upfront payments based on enrollment instead of actual attendance “invites abuse” and that the new rules will “make fraud harder to perpetrate.”
On Dec. 1, New Hampshire started its prospective payment system, which would allow child care providers to bill a week in advance for Child Care Scholarship Program services, in an effort to ease administrative burdens.
It is currently unclear how new federal guidelines will impact New Hampshire’s programs.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/childcaresubsidies-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-06 13:57:34.699472

The move comes as the Trump administration has heightened federal oversight of child care subsidy distribution after a conservative social media influencer alleged fraud in Minnesota’s child care programs. 
After Minnesota fraud allegations, HHS orders states to justify child care spending

In a letter last week, two Idaho Republican lawmakers — Rep. Josh Tanner, an Eagle Republican who on Monday became co-chairman of the Legislature’s powerful budget committee, and Sen. Brian Lenney, a Nampa Republican — asked the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare to freeze payments for Idaho’s program, which they called similar to Minnesota’s.
Idaho’s funds haven’t yet been doled out, but the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare is shoring up oversight efforts now, agency spokesperson AJ McWhorter said in a statement Friday. 
“Recent federal enforcement actions in Minnesota, now under investigation as one of the largest welfare-fraud schemes in U.S. history, have revealed systemic vulnerabilities in childcare subsidy programs similar in structure to Idaho’s,” Tanner and Lenney wrote. “Those investigations identified inadequate enrollment verification, limited financial oversight, and insufficient inspection controls.”

In their Dec. 31 letter, Lenney and Tanner asked Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Director Juliet Charron to temporarily suspend “proposal solicitations, contract issuances, and fund disbursements” linked to $14 million in funding the Legislature approved in 2025 to expand child care availability, “pending implementation of enhanced program-integrity and fraud-prevention safeguards.”
Lenney and Tanner could not be reached for comment. 
 Idaho’s funds haven’t been given out, Department of Health and Welfare says

The lawmakers called on freezing the state’s spending for $14 million in federal funds for the Idaho Child Care Program. Last year through Senate Bill 1206, the Legislature allowed the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare to spend that money to boost child care availability through contracts, grants and programs. 
The Department of Health and Welfare “is committed to administering all programs with robust oversight and will continue efforts to address suspected fraudulent behavior by bad actors,” McWhorter said last week. “While the department has established processes for fraud and abuse identification and mitigation, the department has been working closely with the Governor’s Office since Monday to take additional steps to conduct heightened reviews of subsidies that were previously disbursed.”

“The department is actively redirecting staff to scale up resources to continue to support these reviews and necessary actions, including provider termination when appropriate,” he said. “Any bad actors will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”
In an X post last week, Lenney called their letter “just the opening shot.”
“Minnesota got torched for BILLIONS in childcare fraud. We’re not waiting around to be next,” he wrote.

It isn’t immediately clear whether fraud has been alleged in Idaho’s program. The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare could not be immediately reached about whether it received specific fraud allegations in its program.
 Idaho’s request came after Minnesota fraud allegations that prompted federal crackdown

On Dec. 18, a federal prosecutor said fraud in Minnesota’s Medicaid services could be more than $9 billion, the Minnesota Reformer reported. 
Then last week, the Trump administration cracked down on child care funding in response to a viral YouTube video by right-wing social media influencer Nick Shirley that alleged Somali-run child care centers receive state and federal funding but had no children attending those centers, the Minnesota Reformer reported. 
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced it froze all child care payments to Minnesota and is requiring states to provide “justification” that federal child care funds they receive are spent on “legitimate” providers in order to get those dollars, States Newsroom reported.
In August 2024, the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare paused new enrollments for parents to receive subsidies through the program for months as the agency anticipated the program would face a budget shortfall. At the time, state officials said the projected shortfall was caused by rising costs of child care and expanded program eligibility, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported.

Collins, a Republican from Jackson, is seeking the GOP nomination to face Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff in November’s midterm election. He is set to face fellow GOP Congressman Buddy Carter and former football coach Derek Dooley in the Republican primary in May.
The House Ethics Committee announced the probe in November but offered no details about the allegations at the time.
A report from the Office of Congressional Conduct released Monday found “substantial reason to believe that Rep. Collins used congressional resources for unofficial or otherwise unauthorized purposes” and paid an intern who was the girlfriend of his chief of staff but who did not actually perform any duties.
According to witnesses cited in the report, the intern, identified as Caroline Craze, received payments of about $5,000 in 2023 and 2024. Craze was reportedly in a relationship with Collins’ then-chief of staff, Brandon Phillips, and was working for Sandy Springs-based Cox Communications during the time she was allegedly paid by Collins’ office.
Phillips served as Collins’ chief of staff from January 2023 through last month and now works as a senior policy adviser for Collins’ campaign.
The report also accuses Phillips of potentially inappropriately spending money set aside for official duties on campaign expenses.
The report says that Collins, Phillips and other campaign staff did not cooperate with the investigation and recommended that the House Committee on Ethics issue subpoenas to them as well as Craze.
In a statement, Collins’ office denied the allegations.
“This bogus complaint is a sad attempt to derail one of Georgia’s most effective conservative legislators in Congress. Rep. Collins looks forward to providing the House Ethics Committee all factual information and putting these meritless allegations to rest,” the office said.
In a letter to the House Committee on Ethics, attorney Russell Duncan, who represents Collins and Phillips, said that the allegations came from “two disgruntled, former members of Congressman Collins staff” and called on the committee to dismiss the matter.
Duncan said the decision to temporarily hire Craze was within Phillips’ discretion and that she “provided valuable assistance to the Office throughout both years regarding communications and other work of the Office.”
Surrogates from both parties are hoping the allegations will stick.
“Mike Collins wouldn’t be refusing to cooperate if he had nothing to hide,” said Devon Cruz, senior communications advisor with the Democratic Party of Georgia, in a statement. “Collins’ apparent abuse of power is disturbing and once again underscores he cannot represent Georgians in the United States Senate.”
The House Ethics Committee consists of 10 members, five from each party. If an investigation reveals wrongdoing, the committee has the power to levy punishments ranging from private letters of admonition to, in especially rare and severe cases, recommendations of expulsion, which require a two-thirds majority vote from the entire House to enact.

Community resident confirms Christina Park needs additional support to address abandoned personal property, trash removal, restroom cleanliness, and other basic services.
 
WILMINGTON, Del. (Jan. 6, 2026) — The City of Wilmington is formalizing the growth of the Christina Park unhoused community and expanding on-site services through a new partnership with Friendship House of Delaware, city officials announced Tuesday.
Mayor John Carney said the agreement places Friendship House in charge of daily management of the city-sanctioned community at Christina Park, which is now the only location in Wilmington where camping is permitted for people experiencing homelessness.
Christina Park was temporarily designated in October 2025 as part of the city’s response to a rising street-unhoused population. City officials estimate more than 600 people are unhoused in Wilmington and nearly 1,600 statewide. Rather than displace residents living outdoors, the city chose to formalize the site as a managed, temporary community focused on safety, sanitation, and access to services while longer-term housing solutions are developed.
Under an initial six-month contract — expected to extend to at least a year — Friendship House will provide daily oversight and coordination for up to 100 tents. Services include implementation of site infrastructure; cleaning and sanitation; cold-weather protocols coordinated with Code Purple; installation of safety stations and posted rules of decorum; coordination of food and donation drop-offs; and on-site case management connecting residents to housing, healthcare, employment, mental-health, and substance-use services.
City officials said the Christina Park community replaces unsanctioned encampments elsewhere in Wilmington. Camping will be prohibited in other locations, with enforcement focused on directing people to the managed site.
A resident’s view underscores service needs
For some residents, Christina Park is more than a temporary shelter — it is a self-described community that still faces daily challenges.
Alfonzo, a 61-year-old veteran and former Boy Scout who lives at the park, said he prefers to call himself a “city camper” rather than a member of the unhoused population. He lives in one tent and uses a second tent as storage for blankets, food, and personal belongings. He said he chose to live at Christina Park rather than stay with his sister in Wilmington.
Alfonzo said he informally serves as an “ambassador” for the park, welcoming new residents and helping them adjust. He said he is not using drugs, though he acknowledged that substance use affects some residents. According to him, his veteran benefits provide $79 a month, which he used to purchase the tents.
He said he is one of the few residents who can boil water — an important capability for washing dishes and maintaining sanitation — and that he regularly helps others access clean water. At the same time, he said the community needs additional support to address abandoned personal property, trash removal, restroom cleanliness, and other basic services.
Alfonzo said he was recently released from jail following an attempted bank robbery and did not want to return to living with family. He described Christina Park as offering structure and autonomy, but said consistent management and services are necessary to keep the site safe and functional — needs the city says Friendship House is contracted to meet.
Part of a broader strategy
City leaders emphasized that Christina Park is not a permanent solution. It is part of a broader homelessness strategy that includes plans for a new daytime dining and service center at 600 Fourth St., expanded affordable housing development, coordination with behavioral-health providers, and potential zoning changes to support additional housing options.
Residents interested in donating food, clothing, or essential items are asked to contact volunteer@friendshiphousede.org.

Gary Tramontina/AP Images for Kmart/WWE","The trial for Ted “Teddy” DiBiase Jr. will be the first, and maybe the only, criminal case brought to jurors in the Mississippi welfare scandal that’s unfolded over the last six years.
The former WWE wrestler, who often appeared publicly alongside the state’s disgraced former human services director from 2018 to 2019, is accused of defrauding two federal assistance programs, while DiBiase has argued he was a lawful contractor.
The other seven people charged with crimes, including the former human services director, a prominent nonprofit founder and DiBiase’s own brother, have pleaded guilty and agreed to aid the prosecution. None are in prison as they continue to await sentencing.
Many other characters have emerged – whether through audits, civil litigation or investigative reporting – for their potential roles in the conspiracy to divert tens of millions of welfare dollars away from the needy. But the federal government hasn’t opened any new indictments in the case in over a year. It hasn’t publicly identified any additional targets.
DiBiase’s trial could signal the beginning of the end of a saga that catapulted government bureaucrats in a poverty-drenched state – as well as the failures of federal welfare reform – into the national spotlight.

Leading up to the trial that started Tuesday, U.S. District Court Judge Carlton Reeves cautioned attorneys against doing anything that may delay the proceedings or trigger the need for a new trial years from now.
In his December 2024 order, Reeves mentioned the defendants awaiting sentencing. “They might be eager to get the DiBiase trial behind them, as it represents a major step toward finality in their own cases,” he wrote.
Days before trial, DiBiase retained an additional lawyer, Eric Herschmann, who is a former adviser to President Donald Trump and has defended retired NFL quarterback Brett Favre against civil charges in the welfare scandal, prompting the federal government to raise questions about a potential conflict of interest. Reeves ultimately allowed Herschmann to represent DiBiase.
Eighty people filed into the Thad Cochran U.S. Courthouse in downtown Jackson Tuesday morning for jury selection.
The federal government is accusing DiBiase – son of famed 1980s-era WWE heel Ted “The Million Dollar Man” DiBiase – of stealing more than $1 million in federal public assistance funds by using “sham contracts” with two nonprofit organizations that controlled the funds. 
On paper, the nonprofits hired the younger DiBiase’s companies to provide leadership outreach services, assess the need for emergency food assistance and create programs to help inner-city youth. He received payments upfront.
But prosecutors allege DiBiase did not provide, or intend to provide, those services. The 13 counts in the indictment include conspiracy, wire fraud, theft of federal funds and money laundering. The federal government also alleges he used the money to purchase a vehicle and a boat and to put a down payment on a roughly $1.5 million lakeside home in the Madison community of Reunion, which the federal government has since seized.
DiBiase’s lawyer refuted the government’s narrative in a 2023 interview with Mississippi Today, saying evidence shows the former pro wrestler did carry out work under the contracts and that DiBiase was free to use the money he earned through his fees as he wished.
The money came from two federal public assistance programs: the Emergency Food Assistance Program and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF, which is best known for supplying the monthly “welfare check” to very low-income households. But Mississippi typically spends very little of its TANF funds on direct assistance to needy families.
The allegations in DiBiase’s criminal case deal with just a sliver of spending within a broader scandal. Auditors have questioned agency purchases totaling nearly $100 million from 2016 to 2020.
Indeed, the nonprofits unlawfully showered TANF funds on dozens of people or companies, according to audits and an ongoing civil lawsuit. 
Judge Reeves’ order hinted at a possible strategy by DiBiase’s defense: Using “testimony to illustrate how many other entities and persons” that the nonprofits “wrongfully sent TANF funds to.” 
In this order, Reeves was discussing the need for defense attorneys to avoid certain testimony because the law firm defending DiBiase had previously defended a separate character in the larger welfare case, posing a potential conflict.

But if the defense is interested in highlighting other improper TANF recipients, it wouldn’t need to mention that person or entity, Reeves wrote, since, “There are many other options available to them to land this blow with the jury.”
For DiBiase, participating in Mississippi’s welfare delivery model was a family endeavor. His father’s nonprofit ministry, Heart of David, and his brother Brett DiBiase also took part. The wrestling family secured nearly $6 million in federal grant funds, according to a forensic audit, under the leadership of former Mississippi Department of Human Services Director John Davis. 
Davis and Brett DiBiase, also a wrestler, pleaded guilty more than three years ago. Ted DiBiase Sr. has not been accused of a crime. All three DiBiase men are named in a separate ongoing civil lawsuit brought by the welfare department.
Davis had become especially close to the wrestlers during his tenure, text messages retrieved by investigators revealed. After the agency selected two nonprofits to run a multi-million dollar statewide welfare program called Families First for Mississippi, Davis then allegedly directed the nonprofits to pay his wrestling buddies in violation of federal law. In one instance, Davis got one of the nonprofits to pay $160,000 in TANF funds for Brett DiBiase’s four-month stay at a luxury addiction treatment facility in Malibu, California.

Davis and others may have believed they could get away with this kind of spending because the federal government barely checks what states do with TANF block grants. Across the nation, states have openly diverted more and more funds away from families in poverty. 
The federal government allocates nearly $90 million a year in TANF funds to Mississippi. “The headline figure is an illusion, though,” wrote Reeves, because in the most recent year on record, the state distributed just $4 million of that to needy families through cash assistance. 
The federal department tasked with overseeing state use of TANF funds is the Administration of Children and Families, or ACF, an agency under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. But as Mississippi Today has reported for several years, that agency has almost no say over what states do with the money. State officials don’t have to spend a dime on the monthly “welfare check” if they don’t want to. Much of the money, instead, is spent on subgrants with organizations that claim to provide services such as parent initiatives, after-school programs or workforce development.
Favre, the most prominent celebrity in the scandal, allegedly helped steer subgranted TANF funds to construct a volleyball arena at his alma mater, the University of Southern Mississippi, as well as to an experimental pharmaceutical company that claimed to have found a cure for concussions. Favre is named in an ongoing civil suit, but he has not been charged with a crime.
Favre has denied any wrongdoing, saying he’d never even heard of the TANF program until more than two years after his projects began receiving the funds. 
“Importantly, I have learned that nobody was — or is — watching how TANF funds are spent,” Favre testified during a U.S. House committee hearing in 2024.

The federal government only requires that states provide a one-page spending breakdown using a number of vague categories, and the agency doesn’t do anything more to verify the accounting. If a state like Mississippi wants to fib, if it wants to describe the construction of a volleyball facility as “Fatherhood and Two Family Parent Formation,” “there’s no way to check that,” the federal agency’s former director told Mississippi Today years ago. 
Revelations from the Mississippi scandal have changed little on the national level. In fact, oversight at ACF has likely only taken a hit as the Trump administration has slashed positions in the agency, closing and consolidating the regional offices that exist to provide guidance to states on their administration of these funds.
New TANF rules proposed under President Joe Biden’s administration – which would have limited some non-assistance spending and finally allowed the federal government the power to determine if purchases were “reasonable” – were abandoned before Trump began his second term.
This all speaks to what the future holds for the TANF program. But what about the past?
There’s no debate that some federal TANF funds were misspent in Mississippi. Seven guilty pleas demonstrate as much. But the federal government has not sent one person to prison or forced the state to repay a dime.
Back in 2020, during Trump’s first term, HHS officials confirmed to Mississippi Today that the state would have to repay any stolen or misspent TANF funds using state dollars. In other words, it could not use federal TANF money to pay the clawback. 
Four years later, Biden’s appointed ACF leadership sent a letter to Mississippi demanding repayment of $101 million. The letter was always expected to serve as a starting point for negotiations. The federal government would allow the state to provide documentation to prove some purchases were lawful in order to whittle down the amount the state must return. 
During Trump’s second term, that penalty letter has been rescinded. The most recent letter from ACF in April said the agency “will issue a new penalty letter at the appropriate time.” 
This federal clawback process hinges in part on Mississippi Department of Human Services’ slow-moving civil lawsuit. The agency is still attempting to verify which TANF purchases were illegal, and recoup those funds, through a lawsuit against dozens of people or companies – sans at least eight lower-level defendants who settled their way out of the lawsuit. 
The department filed the lawsuit in 2022 and has spent roughly $2 million – in TANF funds – on outside attorneys. 
A handful of those defendants, such as Jacob Black, were employees of the very agency bringing the lawsuit. The former lawyer for the human services department is accused of crafting the lease structure officials used to fund the volleyball arena, skirting a federal prohibition against spending TANF on construction costs. For this, he has faced no criminal charges.
Most recently, defendants in the civil case took depositions of a former division director at the state auditor’s office, Stephanie Palmertree, who now runs her own firm that DHS has contracted with to provide expert testimony in the case. The welfare department has paid the firm $112,500, according to the state’s public expenditure database, but by Monday, the agency had removed Palmertree as its expert. No trial has been scheduled in the DHS case.
In another civil case that began in early 2023, Favre is still suing State Auditor Shad White for defamation. A trial is set for November 2026. Ted DiBiase Sr. also filed a defamation complaint against White in August. 
As for criminal consequences, the following people have pleaded guilty in connection to the scandal and await sentencing:

John Davis pleaded guilty to state and federal fraud charges in September 2022.
Nancy New pleaded guilty to state bribery and fraud charges in April 2022.
Zach New pleaded guilty to state bribery and fraud charges in April 2022.
Jake Vanlandingham pleaded guilty to a federal fraud charge in July 2024.
Brett DiBiase pleaded guilty to a state fraud charge in December 2020 and a federal conspiracy charge in March 2023.
Christi Webb pleaded guilty to a federal theft charge in March 2023.
Ann McGrew pleaded guilty to a state fraud charge in October 2021.

Another defendant originally arrested in 2020, Gregory “Latimer” Smith, underwent pretrial diversion, effectively avoiding prosecution. 
Only DiBiase is still fighting charges. 
It’s common for prosecutors to wait until the resolution of an investigation, or the conclusion of all cases, before sentencing. These defendants have agreed to aid the prosecution and may appear as witnesses. Their sentences could be contingent on their level of cooperation. 
And while the public waits for justice, more than $150 million in Mississippi TANF funds sit unused, according to the most recent federal data. 
Mississippi Today has reported on these federal reports for years, and while the figures in them fluctuate wildly, they conjure deja vu.
Since the scandal, Mississippi’s welfare department has tightened oversight of its TANF subgrants, instituting a competitive application process. It also successfully secured an increase to the monthly TANF benefit – raising the amount from $170 to $260 for a family of three – and adopted a “pass-through” that allows families to keep more of their child support dollars before the state recoups the rest. More recently, the agency has elected to transfer nearly $30 million a year in TANF funds to the state’s child care voucher, allowing that program to serve more working families. 
“The agency needs to be acknowledged for those efforts, too,” said Mark Jones, spokesperson for the human services department.
Still, the state is spending less of its TANF funds on direct cash assistance today than it did under the leadership of convicted felon Davis.
This can be attributed, at least in part, to the state’s stringent eligibility criteria for TANF set by the Legislature. The state also continues to use a large chunk of its block grant to fill holes at a separate agency, the Mississippi Department of Child Protection Services. And nonprofits are still awarded five times more than poor families receive directly.

Though the monthly “welfare check” is administered under a program called the “TANF Work Program,” nearly 80% of the families on the program are “child only” cases, meaning no parent is receiving assistance or workforce training as part of the case. And fewer than 1,500 families receive the assistance each month. 
This is in a state where over 100,000 families live below the poverty line.
The “Mississippi welfare scandal” – nearing its sixth anniversary since initial arrests – has multiple possible definitions. 
Was the tragedy that a volleyball arena project, or a nebulous pharmaceutical startup, or a famous and wealthy athlete received TANF funds? Or that poor families didn’t?
Because in the case of the latter, the scandal endures.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/06120502/100116138569-scaled.jpg,,,2026-01-06 13:11:41.628427

Miller,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2026/01/lamalfa-dies-vacancy/,"LaMalfa was known for his dedication to water access and forestry management, key issues for his largely rural district. His death leaves House Republicans with an even more precarious majority that could struggle to pass Republican legislation.","In summary
LaMalfa was known for his dedication to water access and forestry management, key issues for his largely rural district. His death leaves House Republicans with an even more precarious majority that could struggle to pass Republican legislation.


Rep. Doug LaMalfa, a fourth generation rice farmer and Republican who for the last 13 years represented much of California’s rural north in Congress, has died. He was 65.
His sudden death, confirmed Tuesday morning by House Republican leadership, further shrinks the party’s already razor-thin majority, which now stands at 218  following Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s resignation this week. The GOP can now only afford to lose two members on any given party-line vote.
While President Donald Trump and House Republicans could consistently count on LaMalfa’s support for conservative priorities such as last year’s mega domestic policy bill, he never adopted the firebrand or antagonist persona that many of his colleagues preferred. 
Instead, LaMalfa developed a reputation as a pragmatic and affable member who prioritized water access and forestry management, key interests for his largely forested, fire-prone and agricultural-heavy district. It’s those issues that led him to staunchly oppose Proposition 50, Gov. Gavin Newsom’s redistricting plan that proposed to lump much of the rural north with parts of the far more urban and liberal San Francisco Bay Area.
Under California election law, Gov. Gavin Newsom has 14 days to call a special election to fill the remainder of LaMalfa’s current term. That election will take place under the existing congressional district lines, which stretch from much of the Oregon-California border through rural Shasta and Sutter counties, rather than the new Democratic-leaning district adopted after voters approved Prop. 50 in November.
That sets up a potentially confusing scenario for voters, as Newsom could set the special election to replace LaMalfa to coincide with the already scheduled statewide primary in June, which uses the new Prop. 50 maps. 
LaMalfa was known for his steadfast commitment to issues that affected his district. One tradition of his was to stake out the president after the State of the Union speech. In those precious few minutes, as the leader of the free world descended the dais and moved to exit the chamber, LaMalfa would make his legislative requests. As the Washington Post reported, after President Joe Biden’s final address, LaMalfa asked the president to force the U.S. Forest Service to speed up permits for cutting timber, telling the president, “We gotta cut some trees.” 
LaMalfa strongly opposed Prop. 50, framing the gerrymander as a significant loss of representation for rural Californians. At a press conference last fall, he stressed how much he loved representing the farmers, ranchers and other agricultural workers in his district, rattling off names of small towns such as Fort Goodwin and Cedarville, where he said he’s knocked on countless doors and held various town halls over the years. 
“I know where all those places are,” LaMalfa told the handful of reporters gathered in the Butte County Farm Bureau lodge. “Do you think that’s going to happen when people from Cedarville, Modoc County, are lumped in with people from Sausalito and Marin County?”
It’s possible that LaMalfa’s successor won’t be sworn in for several months, depending on when Newsom calls the special election and whether any candidate receives 50% of the vote. If not, voters will have to cast ballots in a runoff election. 
“Whoever runs for it is literally going to be a congressman for a month,” said Paul Mitchell, the primary architect of the Prop. 50 districts. He noted that even though a Republican would likely win the special election, “there’s no reality that they’re going to win the Prop. 50 map.”
He noted that House Republicans would benefit from uniting behind a single candidate to avoid a runoff, whereas Democrats would likely prefer to keep the seat open as long as possible. 
Neither of LaMalfa’s Democratic challengers, state Sen. Mike McGuire and Chico State Professor Audrey Denney, immediately said whether they would run in a special election.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/081124_LaMalfa-TownHall_SO_CM_31.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-06 12:58:57.383658

(Photo courtesy of Revolution Wind)Rhode Island and Connecticut attorneys general in legal filings Monday asked to consolidate their federal lawsuit against the Trump administration with a separate complaint lodged by the developers of the Revolution Wind project. 
Both lawsuits were initially filed in the wake of an Aug. 22 stop work order from federal regulators on the 65-turbine project, then 80% complete south of Rhode Island’s coastline. Both complaints sought court intervention — the developers in D.C. and the AGs in Rhode Island — to bar the Trump administration from what plaintiffs argued was an unconstitutional overreach of federal authority on the 704-megawatt wind project.
The developers’ case progressed more quickly, with Senior Judge Royce Lamberth of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia granting a preliminary injunction on Sept. 22 temporarily barring federal regulators from interfering with the project. The AGs’ case languished in Providence with no court order until being transferred to D.C. in early December.
The two complaints remained on separate trajectories when the U.S. Department of Interior issued a second suspension order on Dec. 22, forcing Revolution Wind, and four other area projects, to press pause for 90 days. 
Revolution Wind developers seek second court order against Trump administration

By Jan. 1, Revolution Wind LLC, a partnership between Danish renewable energy company Orsted A/S and a consortium of other companies led by Skyborn Renewables, replied with a flurry of new court filings asking for a second preliminary injunction. The new submissions reprised many of the same arguments of the original case: The Trump administration’s latest move was “arbitrary and capricious” with significant financial, economic and environmental consequences for the companies if work did not resume quickly.
The project was 87% complete when the second suspension was handed down, with 58 of 65 turbines built and offshore installation on track to be completed by mid-February. Since Dec. 22, the project developers estimate they are losing $1.44 million a day, with a projected $6 billion loss and risks of broken contracts if they cannot resume work by Jan. 12, according to court filings.
Rhode Island and Connecticut stand to suffer major losses, too, underscored in the lawsuit filed by Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha and Connecticut Attorney General William Tong.
The 704 megawatts of nameplate capacity is enough to power 350,000 homes across both states, with the 400 megawatt share directed toward Rhode Island representing one-fifth of the state’s electricity needs, according to a Jan. 5 affidavit from Chistopher Kearns, the state’s acting energy commissioner. The renewable energy infusion is critical to meeting mandated state emissions reductions under the 2021 Act on Climate Law, and to smoothing seasonal fuel supply and price fluctuations across the regional grid.
“Any significant impact to this project, including but not limited to the loss of the 704MW load, would have grid reliability risks to Rhode Island and New England,” Kearns wrote.
The project has already employed more than 1,000 union laborers in Rhode Island, including 200 on standby amid the second pause. And even after Rhode Island’s first major wind project is up and running, other area projects will rely on the Ocean State’s workforce expertise and upgraded ports to assist in their own construction and operations.
“Revolution Wind’s investments have continued to catalyze infrastructure upgrades at ProvPort and the Port of Davisville, and positioned Rhode Island as a leader in attracting global ocean economy companies,” Kearns wrote.
The AGs have asked Lamberth to rule on their request to consolidate their case with the Revolution Wind developers by Wednesday. They are also seeking to join the developers’ motion for a second preliminary injunction, with a hearing scheduled in Lamberth’s D.C. courtroom on Monday, Jan. 12.
Meaghan Wims, a spokesperson for Orsted, declined to comment in an emailed response Tuesday.  
Matthew Nies, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Justice, which is representing the Trump administration in both cases, declined to comment in an emailed response Tuesday. However, Justice Department attorneys previously argued that the AGs’ case should be transferred to D.C. and consolidated with the Revolution Wind developers lawsuit.

It shows, two law professors explained, that the nation has worked hard to move on quickly from the events of that day — perhaps too fast.
“This is true in Michigan and around the country, that the people who were involved really at any level of the effort to steal the election,” said Quinn Yeargain, a professor of the law of democracy at Michigan State University, “every single person, for the most part, with some notable exceptions like Rudy Giuliani, have largely managed to evade consequence for their actions, and have just resumed doing what they were doing before, or have come into greater positions of power.” 
“By not having consequences, it sort of entrenched that that was an acceptable thing to think and do,” he added. “And to the extent that we’re able to unravel this mess, I think that there definitely has to be consequences, whether they’re political, criminal, legal, for people who have facilitated all of this and committed crimes along the way.”
Samuel Bagenstos, a professor of law at the University of Michigan who worked in the Biden administration, said that he understood the desire to focus on other pressing issues, not least the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. But he also called it “fundamentally a mistake” to not have also addressed the Jan. 6 attacks with the same urgency.

GPO-J6-REPORT 
“Our elected leaders decided that they wanted to move on from this challenge to democracy, and what that meant was it created a space for January 6 to become just another contested issue between the parties,” Bagenstos said. “And so instead of coming together to defend our democracy and our Constitution, what we have is now just division over this as every other issue in the United States between the parties.”
Michigan had a central part to play in the election denialism that led up to the events of Jan. 6, 2021, as one of the key swing states that eventually voted against Trump to lead Joe Biden to victory. But those involved in the attempts to deny and overturn the election here in Michigan have, following national trends, avoided significant consequences. 
Analysis: What we now know about Michigan’s pivotal role in the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection

Michigan’s alleged “false electors,” who attempted to cast the state’s slate of electoral votes in 2020 for Trump, had their charges dismissed in September by Lansing 54-A District Court Judge Kristen Simmons, who said that there was not sufficient evidence to prove that those who allegedly signed the documents had criminal intent. That decision came after one of the alleged electors, James Renner, testified in court following a cooperation agreement that led to charges against him being dropped.
All 16 of the alleged false electors were also pardoned in November by Trump in sweeping pardons of over 70 individuals nationwide — though those federal pardons would not apply to the state-level charges that they had faced, which Attorney General Dana Nessel has indicated her office is reviewing. 
Yeargain said state laws are not set up to deal with these kinds of prosecutions. 
“The dismissal of the indictment against people involved in Michigan’s fake electors scheme really shows that and generally the difficulties that state level prosecutors have had in bringing some of these charges,” Yeargain said.
Among those pardoned were former Republican National Committeewoman Kathy Berden and former Michigan Republican Party co-chair Meshawn Maddock. Others remain in elected office: Amy Facchinello sits on the Grand Blanc Board of Education, while Kent Vanderwood serves as the mayor of Wyoming, and Stanley Grot was re-elected as the township clerk in Shelby Township in 2024. And both Maddock and Kenneth Thompson are county co-chairs on the U.S. Senate campaign for Mike Rogers, who has himself cast doubt on his own electoral loss in 2024.
Screenshot of post dated 12/14/20 from Meshawn Maddock’s Fakebook page
Meanwhile, Matt DePerno, a lawyer facing felony charges of election tampering during the 2020 election, is running for Michigan Attorney General in 2026. DePerno was nominated by the Republican Party in 2022 for the same race, losing to incumbent Dana Nessel by nearly 10 points, but is seeking another shot at the seat.
The lack of consequences for those who participated in the Jan. 6 riots and the surrounding attempts to overturn the election, has set the stage for Trump’s second term in many ways, Yeargain and Bagenstos both agreed.
“I don’t know how to disaggregate January 6 itself from Trump’s second term,” Yeargain said. “In many ways, I think that the pillaging of the federal government that has taken place in the past year has really been January 6, part two.”
But while Michigan was at the center of the election denialism movement in 2020 and 2021, Bagenstos said that the larger failures were on the federal level — specifically, Congress’ failure not to immediately impeach Trump and hold a Senate trial. 
“It was this idea by the leadership that what we needed to do was move on and let the temperatures cool,” he said. “What that did was give Donald Trump and the people around him who had engaged in this violent scheme to seize power and not give up power, gave them the opportunity to regroup and to start to plot to return to power.”
As for whether consequences will come in the future for those who took part in the attempts to overturn the 2020 election, “That must be the case,” Yeargain said. “There must be that kind of reckoning. If we are to maintain as a democratic republic with any sense and semblance of constitutional meaning, there must be.”

In November, OU psychology junior Samantha Fulnecky filed a formal claim of illegal discrimination after receiving a zero on an essay on gender stereotypes in which she cited the Bible as her sole source, later published by The Oklahoman.
The instructor, Mel Curth, said in her grading comments the paper did not follow the assignment and was at times “offensive.” In the essay, Fulnecky wrote that the “lie that there are multiple genders… is demonic and severely harms American youth,” as well as “lies spread from Satan.”
Curth was placed on administrative leave during the university’s investigation and was later relieved of all instructional duties at the investigation’s conclusion — a decision Curth is appealing, according to a Bluesky post from civil rights attorney Brittany Stewart.
OU claimed Curth’s grading of the paper was “arbitrary.” It did not release the findings of the investigation into Fulnecky’s religious discrimination claim, and the grade appeal was decided in her favor.
The petition, which has 24,571 signatures as of Monday afternoon and is addressed to OU President Joseph Harroz, demands OU:

“OU’s decision to place the instructor on administrative leave following a routine grading dispute — a decision it has yet to adequately explain — and subsequent failure to defend her from harassment and discrimination, including reported death threats, raises serious concerns about the University’s commitment to educational standards, academic freedom and instructor safety,” the petition reads.
OU’s Faculty Handbook pulls its definition of “academic freedom” from the AAUP:
“As teachers, faculty members encourage the free pursuit of learning in their students,” the policy reads. “They hold before them the best scholarly and ethical standards of their discipline. Faculty members demonstrate respect for students as individuals and adhere to their proper roles as intellectual guides and counselors. Faculty members make every reasonable effort to foster honest academic conduct and to ensure that their evaluations of students reflect each student’s true merit.”
OU-AAUP President Michael Givel said the university’s actions open a “can of worms” for academic freedom and scholarly integrity.
“There’s a crisis at OU,” Givel said. “… are there concrete standards, in terms of academic integrity, scientific values, scholarly research? Or do instructors and anybody else have to worry about somebody who doesn’t like their grade claiming they’ve been discriminated against based on, supposedly, religion?”
Givel said the AAUP chapter wants clarity on the university’s response process for student discrimination complaints — a process he said is not in writing.
The case has drawn backlash from all sides. In November, Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt posted on social media, calling for the OU Board of Regents to review the investigation. National publications have taken notice. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis called the incident “intellectual rot in higher education.”
In December, hundreds of supporters gathered at OU’s Norman campus to protest Curth’s suspension.
Fulnecky has since spoken to media outlets and at a recent event hosted by local conservative group Original Constitutional Principles Affecting Culture.
“I was asked to give my opinion, and I gave my opinion,” Fulnecky said at the event. “I’ve gotten 100% on every essay I’ve written in that class.”
Punitive measures for universities are also making their way to the state Capitol. Last week, Rep. Gabe Woolley (R-Broken Arrow) filed House Joint Resolution 1037, which would grant the legislature the authority to freeze, suspend or withhold up to 100% of state-appropriated funds recommended for allocation to a higher education institution within the Oklahoma State System for Higher Education. If approved, the measure would be placed on a statewide ballot.
OU did not return a request for comment on the AAUP’s petition. Givel said his organization will decide what it will do next if the university does not respond to the demands.

The Wyoming Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled that the state’s two abortion bans are unconstitutional, preserving a hotly contested right amid a push by legislators to end the practice in the Equality State.
In a 4-1 decision, the court agreed the bans conflict with a 2012 amendment to the Wyoming Constitution that protects individuals’ rights to make their own health care decisions. That amendment, ironically, was enacted by voters after a push by conservatives in the same Legislature that’s since made repeated attempts to curtail abortion.
Ballot initiative to end Idaho’s abortion ban has more than 50,000 signatures, group says

“A woman has a fundamental right to make her own health care decisions, including the decision to have an abortion,” the ruling states.

“The State did not meet its burden of demonstrating the Abortion Laws further the compelling interest of protecting unborn life without unduly infringing upon the woman’s fundamental right to make her own health care decisions. As such, the Abortion Laws do not constitute reasonable and necessary restrictions on a pregnant woman’s right to make her own health care decisions.”
The ruling represents a victory for abortions rights advocates in one of the nation’s reddest states. They contend abortion bans conflict with the state’s long history of skepticism toward government involvement in medical and other personal decisions.
For abortion opponents, the decision is a bitter setback that suggests an abortion ban would require changes to the Wyoming Constitution — a more difficult hurdle than a simple majority vote in the Republican-dominated statehouse.
 Republican push to end abortion in Wyoming came after fall of Roe v. Wade

Wyoming’s once vaunted live-and-let-live political ethos for years thwarted legislative attempts to restrict abortion. That began to change in the years before the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark 2022 decision overturning Roe v. Wade, which had guaranteed abortion rights in the U.S. since 1973.
In early 2022, Wyoming lawmakers passed a trigger law that banned abortion with Roe’s fall. But that ban did not go into effect due to a court challenge that centered, in part, on Wyoming’s 2012 constitutional amendment.
In 2023, Republican lawmakers in the Legislature tried again, this time succeeding in passing two abortion bans. One was a fairly comprehensive prohibition that included only a few notable exceptions, such as in the case of rape or incest. A second law banned medication in abortions — the first law of its kind in the nation.
A group of abortion providers and advocates challenged the constitutionality of the bans, and Teton County District Judge Melissa Owens temporarily blocked them as the case played out.

Finally in November 2024, Owens ruled the bans were unconstitutional. The state, which was represented by the Wyoming Attorney General’s Office, appealed the decision to the Wyoming Supreme Court. The justices heard arguments on the case in April.
In the meantime, Wellspring Health Access in Casper has provided abortions for women in Wyoming and neighboring states. The facility was targeted by an arsonist before it opened and later became a plaintiff in the legal challenges to the growing number of abortion restrictions passed by state lawmakers, including mandatory ultrasounds and a 48-hour waiting period passed earlier this year.
Justice Kari Gray was the dissenting vote in the case while Justice John Fenn authored a concurring opinion. Meanwhile, retired Justice Kate Fox participated in the case’s consideration and decision since she heard the case, per state law and the Wyoming Constitution.

(Getty Images)Nearly 92% of Indiana’s high school seniors graduated in 2025, setting the highest graduation rate on record, the Indiana Department of Education announced Monday.
“Today’s record-high graduation rate is a testament to the hard work of Indiana’s students, families, and educators,” Gov. Mike Braun said in a news release.
“While high school graduation marks the end of a student’s K-12 journey, our schools play an essential role in preparing students for all that comes next, whether that’s going to college, starting a career, or joining the military,” he continued. “This strong improvement in our state’s graduation rate shows that when we focus on academic excellence and establish clear, personalized pathways, our students thrive.”
The 91.83% graduation rate bested the 90.23% record set in 2024 by 1.6 percentage points.
It represents the third straight year of post-pandemic improvement kicked off in 2023, when 88.98% graduated. Seniors recorded a decade-low graduation rate of 86.65% in 2022.

“As we continue to scale the new Indiana diploma and readiness seals statewide, we will not only strengthen the value of high school and help more students graduate, we will ensure that they are prepared to succeed in whatever path they choose for their future,” state Education Secretary Katie Jenner said.
Numerous student populations improved in the results released Tuesday.
Almost 87% of Black students graduated in 2025, up 3 percentage points from the previous year, along with nearly 90% of Hispanic students, in a boost of 2 percentage points. White students improved to 93%, or by about 1.5 percentage points, and their multiracial classmates logged a graduation rate of 88%, up by 1 percentage point.
Seniors learning English, receiving free and reduced-price meals, and in special education also graduated at higher rates than the year prior — but still lagged their native speaker, paid lunch and general education peers.
The rate of students who graduated without waivers additionally cleared 90%. Students who do not complete or pass some graduation requirements can still qualify for a diploma if they demonstrate knowledge or skill.
The waivers are intended to help students with special circumstances, like those who’ve transferred to a new school or who have attempted to pass competency tests at least three times.

State education and policy leaders have for years sought to lower dependence on waivers, including by setting caps on the percentage of graduation waivers that can be counted toward a school’s state and local graduation rate. They took effect with the 2024 cohort.
Non-public schools outperformed their public counterparts by about 1 percentage point — 93% versus 92% — but the differences between traditional public and public charter schools were not reported. In the 2024 results, about 93% of students at traditional public schools graduated as opposed to just 59% of students at public charter schools.
Indiana’s federal graduation rate increased, almost hitting 90% compared to 2024’s 89%. The rates are calculated differently because of differences between state and federal accountability models, according to IDOE.

(Photo by Kevin Hardy/Stateline)When I heard my former student Mike was suspended after shoving and injuring my 2nd grade student, Eddy, as they got off the bus at the start of a recent school day, I wondered if I could repair what had been done, providing an outcome that would make a positive difference in the lives of these boys.
Could I mediate a conversation between them so that Mike, now in middle school, understood the gravity of what he did? Could I help ensure Eddy felt safe around older students?
Buoyed by the idea of using restorative practices, which separate the deed from the doer and shift the focus away from punishing Mike to address and fix the harm that was done, I asked my school administrators and the boys’ families if Mike could spend time in my classroom as a tutor and mentor to Eddy.
The powerful connection that grew between the boys as a result of this extra effort gives me so much hope.
Across the country, including schools around Pennsylvania, projects are underway to turn traditional student discipline models on their heads. Why? It’s all about encouraging appropriate behavior by bringing students into the collaborative process to resolve the issues.
A recent study by the University of Chicago Education Lab found that schools that implemented restorative practices saw proactive changes in students’ behaviors—including an 18% decrease in suspensions—with many youth experiencing a stronger sense of belonging.
In 2023, Representative Anthony Bellmon introduced bipartisian legislation that reflected this growing body of research and would have embedded conflict resolution instruction into both coursework and educator training. The bill, which didn’t pass, was meant to ensure students develop skills such as mediation, effective communication, emotional regulation, and relationship-building by equipping educators with sustained professional learning to put these practices into action in our schools.
Restorative practices and  more robust teacher training are important strategies that go beyond what is included as student supports in Pennsylvania Statute.
Here’s why:
First, they are a more effective and sustaining way to address discipline. Suspension, which pulls students away from their classrooms and learning, doesn’t always help them see the bigger picture of how their behaviors affect others. After the incident, Eddy was hesitant to be anywhere near Mike. However, as I supported them, each boy had a role to play as they worked together. Eddy became more relaxed; feelings of safety and trust replaced his uncertainty as they built a mentor-mentee relationship. Meanwhile, Mike got a “little brother” out of the deal.
Another reason for employing restorative practices is that it teaches students collaborative skills. With Mike’s support, Eddy, who struggled with reading comprehension, became more confident to ask questions of me and his peers when he struggled to understand what he read. For his part, Eddy’s calm nature forced Mike to slow down, which helped him be more patient and understanding while also strengthening his confidence in his abilities as Eddy’s reading tutor. And the time they spent together encouraged conversations outside of academics. Soon Mike and Eddy were singing songs they both liked.
Just as important, restorative practices help students work through conflicts, giving students tools to engage with each other during disagreements and empowering them to use their voice and become part of change.
During the last week of school, as the students walked to their bus, Mike playfully pulled Eddy into a hug and ruffled Eddy’s hair. Eddy was full of smiles and giggles. I was near enough to overhear their conversation: “Eddy, I’m sorry for what I did to you. I don’t know why I did it. If I could take it back, I would.”
The Latin root for discipline is discere which means “to learn.” Restorative practices are a tool that educators can use to teach students how to navigate their social world. Let’s bring it into schools across Pennsylvania so that students like Mike and Eddy can move beyond punishment and into a place where they belong and get along.

Free.,Death of US House member from California narrows already slim GOP majority,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/death-us-house-member-california-narrows-already-slim-gop-majority,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. California Republican Rep. Doug LaMalfa has died and Indiana Republican Rep. Jim Baird was injured in a car accident, President Donald Trump said Tuesday. Speaking to a meeting of House Republicans at the Kennedy Center, Trump said he wanted to express “our tremendous sorrow” following LaMalfa’s death and said the congressman was “a fierce champion on California water issues.”“I also want to send our best wishes to Congressman Jim Baird and his wife, who are recovering from a car accident. They’re going to be okay. But they had a pretty bad accident,” Trump said. “And we’re praying they get out of that hospital very quickly. He’s going to be fine. She’s going to be fine. But it was a bad accident.”The cause and timing of LaMalfa’s death were not immediately clear on Tuesday morning. It will reduce Republicans’ already slim House majority, making it more complicated for leadership in that chamber to pass legislation that’s not bipartisan. Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s resignation earlier this week, combined with LaMalfa’s death, decreases the GOP majority to 219 seats. Baird’s absence until he recovers and can vote in person further erodes that to 218. And it could be narrowed even more by GOP lawmakers missing votes for other reasons. Democrats control 213 House seats, giving Republican leaders next to no margin for defections on partisan bills. LaMalfa, 65, was first sworn in as a member of Congress in January 2013 and represented California’s 1st Congressional District, which covers a large section of the northeastern corner of the state. Baird, 80, has been a member of Congress for seven years, representing Indiana’s 4th Congressional District constituents in the central and northwestern parts of the state. Baird’s office released a statement shortly after Trump’s announcement, saying the congressman ""is in the hospital and is expected to make a full recovery, and he is extraordinarily grateful for everyone’s prayers during this time. “Congressman Baird looks forward to continuing his work on behalf of Hoosiers. The Office of Congressman Baird will continue to provide services and support for those who need it. Congressman Baird and his office remain steadfast in their commitment to serving constituents and focused on advocating for Hoosiers at the highest levels of government.”Johnson, Jeffries mourn LaMalfaSpeaker Mike Johnson, R-La., released a statement saying that “Congress is devastated to learn this morning about the passing of our dear friend and colleague, Doug LaMalfa.” “Doug was a lifelong resident of northern California and deeply loved its people. He was as fierce of a fighter for his state’s vast natural resources and beauty as we have ever known,” Johnson wrote. “We are mourning the loss of our friend and brother today and we send our respects for his life and work to his wife Jill and the LaMalfa family during this difficult time.” House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York wrote in a statement that he joined “people across Northern California in mourning the untimely passing of Congressman Doug LaMalfa. “Doug and I joined the Congress as classmates in 2013, and it was an honor to witness firsthand his passion and personal resolve for more than a decade,” Jeffries wrote. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., released a written statement that he was “devastated to hear of the passing of my dear friend and colleague, Doug LaMalfa.”“A fourth generation rice farmer, he fought passionately for the region’s agricultural community and small businesses, and in 2024 was elected Chairman of the Congressional Western Caucus, which focuses on the priorities of Western and rural America,” Scalise wrote. “He also worked to bolster disaster recovery efforts and funding for rural schools.”National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Richard Hudson of North Carolina wrote in a statement that he was “deeply saddened by the passing of my colleague and close friend, Congressman Doug LaMalfa.” “I cherished our time serving together on the Agriculture Committee and discussing NASCAR; he was a real gearhead and motorsports fan,” Hudson wrote. “I will deeply miss my ‘amigo.’ Renee and I are praying for his beloved wife Jill, as well as Kyle, Allison, Sophia, Natalie, and all his loved ones, friends, and staff during this incredibly difficult time.”",,,,2026-01-06 11:58:46.502630

Tim Walz ending his reelection campaign in light of alleged widespread fraud in the state’s social services programs, Michigan Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt, who is also a Republican candidate for governor, is now seeking an audit of the Great Lakes state’s child care programs.
Nesbitt, of Porter Township, on Jan. 2, issued a letter to Michigan’s Auditor General Doug Ringler asking his office to take a look into the Michigan Child Development and Care Program housed in the relatively new state Department of Lifelong Education, Advancement and Potential, or MILEAP. While the program began in 2018, it moved to MILEAP when Gov. Gretchen Whitmer created that agency in her second term via executive order.
A message seeking comment from the department was not returned at the time of publication.
Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz ends campaign for third term

The senator and gubernatorial candidate wrote that he wanted Ringler to take a deeper look into the program in light of what was happening in Minnesota.
Reporting from Michigan Advance’s sister publication, the Minnesota Reformer, shows that Walz, a Democrat who was the 2024 vice presidential nominee, faced headwinds after national Republicans learned about the wide-scale fraud in Minnesota’s social services programs during Walz’s tenure. That includes the Feeding Our Future scandal, in which fraudsters pocketed hundreds of millions in taxpayer dollars intended to feed children during the pandemic, the Reformer reported.
It has also been reported that the national attention to Minnesota’s issues was driven by a right-wing YouTuber specifically directed to various day care centers by that state’s Republican Party.
In his letter to Ringler, Nesbitt noted that Michigan’s program is intended to assist low-income families with the cost of child care and has received more than $540 million in taxpayer support this year. 
“The lack of affordable child care is one of the greatest challenges facing families in Michigan,” Nesbitt wrote. “As such, every tax dollar lost to fraud or waste makes it even more difficult for law-abiding Michiganders to get the child care they need.”
Nesbitt also said the audit was important because of what he viewed as previous oversight failures from the Whitmer administration.

Trump […]","The Nevada State Republican Party posted this picture on social media after party chairman Michael McDonald, center, and five other Republicans signed a fake certificate in December 2020 falsely claiming that Donald Trump had won the 2020 presidential election in Nevada that Trump lost to Joe Biden.Nevada State Republican Party Chairman Michael McDonald and the five other 2020 fake presidential electors from Nevada – James DeGraffenreid, Duward James Hindle III, Jesse Law, Shawn Meehan and Eileen Rice — must be celebrating today in observance of the violent attempt to overthrow an election by storming the U.S. Capitol five years ago.
Trump attorneys instructed McDonald, DeGraffenried, et al. to meet in Carson City in December 2020 and pretend Trump had won the presidential race in Nevada, even though old Joe Biden beat Trump fair and square.
Due to the patent absurdity of not only the McDonald-led cast of characters but also their empty election fraud claims, their tawdry little ceremony on Dec. 24, 2020, was mostly brushed off at the time as just another exhibition of Trump-inspired quackery.
And yet the plot to steal the election, and the January 6 insurrection that ensued, rested on the existence of fake electors from Nevada and six other states. That’s why Team Trump instructed Nevada’s fake electors to put on their pathetic little show and then send fake electoral certifications to Congress.
Under the scheme crafted largely by Trump lawyer John Eastman, Vice-president Mike Pence, while overseeing the electoral vote count, would accept the fake certificates from Nevada and other states as grounds to declare the election results in dispute and either not count them or throw the election to the House of Representatives to determine the election outcome. Under either scenario, Trump would have been declared the winner of the election he lost.
Of course it turned out Mike Pence had at least an ounce or two of something wholly undetectable in the likes of Trump, Eastman, or McDonald: patriotism. If you’ll recall, according to Trump’s followers that day, patriotism is an offense punishable by hanging.
McDonald is still the chair of the Nevada State Republican Party, and the party has an astounding preponderance of weak candidates and failed campaigns to show for it.
The most — only — high profile victory by a Nevada Republican in a competitive contest over the last ten years was Joe Lombardo’s win over former incumbent Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak in 2022. Upon securing the nomination, Lombardo’s campaign tried to get as little of Trump, or the Nevada Republican Party, on their candidate as possible, and Lombardo won  despite the state party, not because of it.
But the Nevada Republican Party’s considerable fecklessness notwithstanding, under McDonald’s leadership, it can always be relied upon to diligently and faithfully put Trump’s interest ahead of Nevada’s.
Like fake electors in other states, McDonald et al. were indicted. Democratic Attorney General Aaron Ford literally could not have been slower in bringing the indictments, only to have a court rule Ford filed the case in the wrong jurisdiction. The Nevada Supreme Court overruled that decision in November, and the case is scheduled to finally be heard next month.
In 2023 the Nevada Legislature passed a law clearly and specifically outlawing fake electors. Perhaps remembering that his political career could be ended with a single social media post from Trump, Lombardo vetoed it.
Trump pardoned the 1,600 lawless insurrectionists on the ground in Washington on Jan. 6. He also pardoned the fake electors in Nevada and the other states who made it all possible. But Ford’s charges are state, not federal, so Trump’s pardon of Nevada’s electors was nothing more than a minor red meat media hit for the base.
Meanwhile, Ford hopes to be the Democratic nominee for governor against Lombardo this year. So maybe Ford will slam Lombardo for vetoing the bill to outlaw fake electors.
Then again, maybe not.
Five years after the insurrection, the most glaring thing about Nevada’s fake electors is the degree to which the state, including many of its elected officials — Republican and Democrat alike — have sought to ignore them, or if that’s not possible, then to normalize them, effectively succumbing to Trump’s attempt to deny and rewrite history.
And now, ironically thanks to a Nevada electorate whose votes Trump and Nevada’s fake electors tried to nullify five years ago, we’ve got the president to show for it.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/fake-electors-bordered.jpg,,,2026-01-06 11:58:46.502630

According to a news release, a traveler from South Carolina who has been diagnosed with measles spent a night in Albuquerque, with potential exposure to others between 11:45 p.m., Dec. 28 and 7 a.m., Dec. 29 at the Quality Inn (450 Paisano St. NE).
The health department said anyone who stayed at the Quality Inn during that time period should check their vaccination status; report any symptoms in the next three weeks to a health care provider; and stay home if symptoms develop. Those symptoms include: fever, cough, runny nose and red eyes followed by a spotted rash that begins on the head before spreading to the rest of the body. People can pass measles on from four days before and after the rash begins.
“This situation reminds us there continue to be active measles cases across the United States,” NMDOH Chief Medical Officer Dr. Miranda Durham said in a statement. “The measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine remains the best protection against measles.”

Wyoming Supreme Court rules two bans passed by state lawmakers are unconstitutional.
The post Abortion remains legal in Wyoming after state high court strikes down bans appeared first on WyoFile .","The Wyoming Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled that the state’s two abortion bans are unconstitutional, preserving a hotly contested right amid a push by legislators to end the practice in the Equality State.
In a 4-1 decision, the court agreed the bans conflict with a 2012 amendment to the Wyoming Constitution that protects individuals’ rights to make their own health care decisions. That amendment, ironically, was enacted by voters after a push by conservatives in the same Legislature that’s since made repeated attempts to curtail abortion.
The ruling represents a victory for abortions rights advocates in one of the nation’s reddest states. They contend abortion bans conflict with the state’s long history of skepticism toward government involvement in medical and other personal decisions.
For abortion opponents, the decision is a bitter setback that suggests an abortion ban would require changes to the Wyoming Constitution — a more difficult hurdle than a simple majority vote in the Republican-dominated statehouse.
Wyoming’s once vaunted live-and-let-live political ethos for years thwarted legislative attempts to restrict abortion. That began to change in the years before the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark 2022 decision overturning Roe v. Wade, which had guaranteed abortion rights in the U.S. since 1973.
In early 2022, Wyoming lawmakers passed a trigger law that banned abortion with Roe’s fall. But that ban did not go into effect due to a court challenge that centered, in part, on Wyoming’s 2012 constitutional amendment. 
In 2023, Republican lawmakers in the Legislature tried again, this time succeeding in passing two abortion bans. One was a fairly comprehensive prohibition that included only a few notable exceptions, such as in the case of rape or incest. A second law banned medication in abortions — the first law of its kind in the nation.
A group of abortion providers and advocates challenged the constitutionality of the bans, and Teton County District Judge Melissa Owens temporarily blocked them as the case played out. 
Finally in November, Owens ruled the bans were unconstitutional. The state, which was represented by the Wyoming Attorney General’s Office, appealed the decision to the Wyoming Supreme Court. The justices heard arguments on the case in April. 
In the meantime, Wellspring Health Access in Casper has provided abortions for women in Wyoming and neighboring states. The facility was targeted by an arsonist before it opened and later became a plaintiff in the legal challenges to the growing number of abortion restrictions passed by state lawmakers, including mandatory ultrasounds and a 48-hour waiting period passed earlier this year.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-06 16:06:20+00:00,CT Mirror,HHS bars Head Start providers from using ‘women’ and ‘race’ in grant applications,Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/06/hhs-bars-head-start-providers-from-using-women-and-race-in-grant-applications/,A coalition of organizations said in court filings that Trump officials told a Head Start director in Wisconsin to cut over a dozen terms from her application.,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is telling Head Start providers to avoid dozens of terms in federal grant applications, including “race,” “belonging” and “pregnant people” — a directive that could reshape the early education program.
A coalition of organizations representing Head Start providers and parents said in court filings last month that the Department of Health and Human Services told a Head Start director in Wisconsin to cut those and over a dozen other terms from her application. She later received a list with nearly 200 words the department discouraged her from using in her application, including “Black,” “Native American,” “disability” and “women.”
President Donald Trump’s administration associates the terms with diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, which it has vowed to root out across the government.
The guidance could lead Head Start centers to preemptively drop anything that could be seen as fitting the administration’s definition of DEI, said Ruth Friedman, who led the Office of Child Care under President Joe Biden.
“Grantees are sort of self-selecting out of those activities beforehand because of fear and direction they’re getting from the Office of Head Start that they can’t do these important research-based activities anymore that are important for children’s learning and that are actually required by law,” Friedman said.
The filings came in a lawsuit filed in April by parent groups and Head Start associations in Washington, Illinois, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin against Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other officials. They allege the Trump administration is illegally dismantling Head Start.
The plaintiffs say the administration is trying to force providers to change how they operate in violation of the Head Start Act, which requires directors to provide demographic information about their families, a task that becomes difficult if they are banned from using “Black,” “disability” and “socioeconomic.”
Health and Human Services officials said they do not comment on pending litigation.
Head Start centers receive the bulk of their funding from the federal government. The long-standing preschool and family support program serves babies, infants and toddlers who come from low-income households, foster care or homeless families.
Plaintiffs’ attorneys say the anti-DEI guidance has generated confusion for Head Start programs, which are operated by nonprofits, schools and government agencies. The grant application itself contains many of the banned words, asking directors to include demographic data about their community that includes estimates of the number of pregnant women and children with disabilities.
“This has put me in an impossible situation,” the unnamed Head Start director in Wisconsin wrote in the court filing. If she complies with the Head Start Act and includes the banned words in her application, she could end up losing her grant, she said. But if she follows the Trump administration’s guidance, she said she fears she’ll face penalties for violating the law down the line.
Another Head Start, located on a Native American reservation in Washington state, was told to cut “all Diversity and Inclusion-related activities,” leading it to drop staff training on how to support autistic children and children with trauma, according to the court filing. Officials there also told the director that she could no longer prioritize tribal members for enrollment — even though the Head Start Act expressly permits this. The word “Tribal” is among the disfavored terms.
For some, the new grant application rules are another attempt to undermine Head Start, a program with a history of bipartisan support that some conservatives have been attacking as problematic and ineffective.
“They don’t believe these public programs should actually be open to serving all communities,” said Jennesa Calvo-Friedman of the ACLU, an attorney for the plaintiffs. The effort to ban words from applications “is a way to gut the fundamentals of the program.”
Not long after Trump took office, his budget chief unsuccessfully tried to halt all federal grants, saying they needed to be reviewed to root out any DEI efforts. Head Start was not supposed to be part of the freeze, which was quickly reversed, but in the months afterward, grantees reported problems drawing down their funding. Some had to briefly close.
The Government Accountability Office later said the delays violated the Impoundment Control Act, which limits when the president can halt the flow of government funds.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/dims.apnews-1-1024x683.webp,,,2026-01-06 11:12:19.146688

The state has the nation’s fourth-highest per capita population of Native Americans, and about one in ten of the residents in its second-largest city — Rapid City, gateway to Mount Rushmore and the Black Hills for millions of annual visitors — are Native American.

Native-led tourism alliance launches ‘economic catalyst’ tours on reservations

It’s the site of the Wounded Knee Massacre, but also the American Indian Movement of the 1970s and its occupation of Wounded Knee. More recently, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe drew international attention to protests over the Dakota Access Pipeline just north of the South Dakota border and etched the phrase “Water is Life” into the cultural lexicon.
Those tribal ties help draw tourists. A survey from South Dakota Tourism in 2018 found that around 80% of visitors want a Native American “experience” during their stay. Yet the state’s nine tribal nations typically don’t see much from the billions in economic impact that tourism delivers to the state.
The South Dakota Native Tourism Alliance formed in 2019 to help bridge that divide. The nonprofit organization trains tour guides, plans tribal tour itineraries and works to develop tourism infrastructure in tribal communities.
Recently, it secured one of 10 J.M. Kaplan Innovation Prize awards, earning it $175,000 and connecting it with other early stage nonprofits across the U.S. for collaboration and guidance.
South Dakota Searchlight recently spoke with Rhea Waldman, South Dakota Native Tourism Alliance’s executive director, and Sarah Kills In Water, a Rosebud Sioux tribal member and member of the group’s board of directors.
EDITOR’S NOTE: The following conversation has been edited for length and clarity.
What can you tell us about what you’ve done so far? Can you give us an update on your economic catalyst tours?
Kills in Water: We worked with Destination America and developed multi-reservation tours, a multi-day tour that started in the Black Hills. They came through Pine Ridge, spent two days on Rosebud and went up to Standing Rock. They ended up marketing that itinerary to a company called Trafalgar, which operates heavily in South Dakota. So that was one major win.

Our tour guide training came up out of a need for another initiative that we worked on, helping the Sicangu Oyate Treaty Council and the Wild Foundation host the Wild 12 conference last year. They brought in people from all over the world, and they wanted to hear from our youth on questions like “How is the mining in the Black Hills going to impact your youth for the next seven generations, for the foreseeable future?” 
So we went to engage with the Sicangu Youth Council, and they jumped on the opportunity. They provided a tour experience for a group of 50 international visitors at Bear Butte State Park. The kids were excited, and they were wanting to expand and do more, and so I brought them into my Trafalgar itinerary this year. They actually do the tours on Rosebud when Trafalgar comes through. 
What’s lacking in the tourism landscape today that your organization aims to improve upon?
Kills In Water: The cultural piece is so important. Having these experiences with us, provided by us, told in our voices, our stories, everything, it makes it more personal, and I think it brings the realization to our visitors that these people are still here. After all the years of government oppression and everything that’s been done to them, they’re still here, and they’re still vibrant.
Tribal people sometimes have a really bad idea when they think about tourism. They think we’re selling our culture, but that’s not what we’re doing. All we’re here to do is help tribal nations define what stories they want to tell. What do you want to share with your visitors? 
Waldman: South Dakota Tourism has been a great partner for us, and really helped us, because obviously they have a lot of data. One of those data points is that over 80% of people want to have a Native American experience when they visit South Dakota. Not even half of them actually do, though. So why don’t they do that? It’s because people don’t know where to go, where to find information.
What are the hidden gems that are already there that you point people to? 
Waldman: Every tribal nation has their own gems. The tribes along the river have some of the most beautiful scenery you can imagine. Cheyenne River has one of the biggest buffalo herds in North America. There are cultural centers that have phenomenal art, that are showcasing local artists and the breadth of the history that Native Americans have experienced.
One of the challenges comes when you think about the great American road trip. When you’re on Interstate 90 between Sioux Falls and Rapid City, none of the reservations really are right there. I live in Pierre, and even though we’re the state capital, it is actually hard to get people out here. It’s because we are 35 miles from the interstate, so it takes you at least an hour and a half to travel there and back. So how much can you see here in order for people to come? That’s even worse for the reservations, because they are not the capital, and people don’t necessarily know all the things they can do. 
What is it that this grant in particular might help you do? 
Kills in Water: The nine tribal nations in our state are so geographically spread out. We don’t always have the resources to get out and go to these tribal nations ourselves. I live in Rosebud, and unless there’s gas money or something tied to it, sometimes I can’t just go to Flandreau. Pine Ridge is close enough where I can volunteer my time, because they’re only an hour and a half from us. With these funds, I see us increasing our partnerships with each tribal nation and really strengthening our efforts that way at the grassroots level.

Waldman: The grant is unrestricted, and that is huge. We’re all aware of travel reimbursement after the fact, but if you’re living in a place where you’re maybe living paycheck to paycheck and you don’t have a thriving business yet, waiting for travel reimbursement can take a while. If you do something like gift cards for gas, that is definitely not something that you can reimburse with federal grants.
And we’re not only getting money. There are 10 different organizations that receive this innovation grant, and we are meeting with them frequently. We can learn from those other amazing entrepreneurs. In addition, the entire team at the JM Kaplan Fund are there to help us succeed, because they know they are funding early stage nonprofits. They’re there with us every step of the way. Yes, money is great and we still need more, but having people that rally for you, that are there for you, that are your family and want to see you succeed, that is really special.

(Courtesy photo)Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger announced on Tuesday morning that long-time educator Jeffrey Smith would be Virginia’s next secretary of education.
The Richmond Times-Dispatch first broke the story about the announcement, as the next administration prepares to shape education and other areas of state governance for the next four years.
Smith has over 32 years of experience in public education, including 15 years as a superintendent. He led Hampton City Schools for eight years and served seven years as superintendent in the Town of West Point. He now leads the Virginia Air and Space Science Center. 
Spanberger appoints former state education secretaries to transition team

“As a mother of three daughters in Virginia’s public schools, I understand the importance of making sure Virginia’s students are set up for success and the invaluable foundation that the Commonwealth’s schools provide for our next generation of leaders,” said Spanberger in a statement. “Dr. Smith’s decades of experience leading districts in Virginia gives the Commonwealth’s students a champion who I know will work tirelessly on their behalf — and I’m excited to work alongside him to strengthen our schools.”
Once confirmed by the General Assembly, which will be under Democratic control in the House and Senate, Smith will guide education agencies and key state learning institutions, including the Virginia Department of Education, the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia, museums and cultural institutions, and boards and foundations.
His career also includes work in several Virginia school divisions and teaching roles at Old Dominion University and William and Mary. 
In 2020, the Virginia General Assembly recognized Smith for his service and academic achievements during his time with Hampton City Schools, among other local, state, and national recognitions. Smith was one of four finalists for AASA National Superintendent of the Year and recipient of the Virginia Department of Education’s Mary Peake Award for Education Equity.
While at Hampton, Smith was involved with two notable accomplishments:  strengthening the division’s dual-enrollment program with the Virginia Peninsula Community College and expanding career pathways at the Academies of Hampton.
“It is an honor to serve as a member of Governor-elect Spanberger’s administration. I strongly support her Strengthening Virginia Schools Plan,” Smith said in Tuesday’s announcement. “Together, we can advance a vision for a Commonwealth that is stronger, safer, and more affordable for all Virginians, ensuring that every learner has the opportunity to achieve and succeed.”
Spanberger will be inaugurated in Richmond on Jan. 17, replacing Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who cannot run for a second consecutive term.

It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
House Speaker Jason White and Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann at separate events on Monday said they plan to push for legislation this year to make it easier for K-12 students to attend schools outside their home districts. 
Hosemann, the Republican president of the Senate, said he wants a more measured policy tailored to public schools. White, the Republican leader of the House, is pushing for a more comprehensive package of policies commonly called “school choice.” 
Hosemann said at a Stennis Institute of Government Capitol Press forum that he wants the Senate to pass a measure to ease restrictions for students to attend public schools outside their districts. 
Mississippi has a very limited version of this policy already, commonly called “portability.” Students can attend schools outside their district, but the receiving and the home districts both have to agree to the transfer. 
Now, Hosemann is pushing his colleagues to remove the requirement that the home district must approve a transfer. 
“I think that’s something arcane and needs to be removed,” Hosemann said. “Where you don’t have the ability to hold a student back who wants to leave and go to another school.” 
Hosemann also said he is pushing the Senate to pass a bill that would raise salaries for K-12 teachers, as well as community college and university professors. 
White on Monday afternoon conducted a press conference in his Capitol office but blocked Mississippi Today from attending. Multiple media outlets provided audio of the press conference to Mississippi Today. 
The first-term speaker also favors legislation that would make it easier for students to transfer to other public school districts But he said on Monday that he will also advocate for legislation for taxpayers to pay for 10,000 or 15,000 students to attend any school in the state, including private schools. 
These programs are referred to as “vouchers” or “education savings accounts” in other states. Families can apply for public tax dollars to pay for education outside of traditional public schools, including homeschooling. Some of these programs are universal, meaning any student can apply. Others are limited by income or group. Mississippi has had an education savings account program for students with disabilities since 2015.
White proposed Monday that of the available slots, lower-income students who come from families making up to 300% of the median income level would receive priority. 
“The slots will be limited,” White said. “And we will receive half of the slots only for current public school kids, and the other slots will be available for any and all students in the state.” 
The speaker also said he will push for legislation to reform Mississippi’s charter-school application process, including allowing charter schools to open in any area of the state. Current state laws only allow charter schools to open in school districts with a D- or F-rating.

The Republican primary field is already crowded, featuring House Speaker Lisa Demuth; MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell; 2022 GOP nominee for governor Scott Jensen; state Rep. Kristin Robbins; and perennial candidate Kendall Qualls, who recently won a straw poll of delegates in the GOP State Central Committee. 
Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan, who is running for U.S. Senate, said in a statement Monday she is focused on the Senate race and will not run for governor. Former U.S. Rep. Dean Phillips said on X that he has no intention to run for governor. 
Primary elections are on Aug. 11. 
Here are some potential Democratic candidates for governor: 
U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar

Amy Klobuchar has represented Minnesota in the U.S. Senate since 2007, and has handily won each of her re-election campaigns since, though the margin of victory has narrowed over time, perhaps reflecting political changes here and nationwide. In 2024, she outperformed presidential candidate Kamala Harris by more than 5 percentage points. 
A source close to Klobuchar, who was granted anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly, said, “Sen. Klobuchar is getting outreach from people encouraging her to run, and is seriously considering it.”
Klobuchar ran in the Democratic presidential primary in 2020 but dropped out after performing poorly in early contests after some withering national press scrutiny. She wound up endorsing former President Joe Biden just before Super Tuesday.
The senior senator previously served as Hennepin County attorney, where she brought high-profile charges. That could give her a platform to talk about the public program fraud that is expected to continue to dominate the political conversation in the coming months.
Secretary of State Steve Simon

Steve Simon has been the state’s top elections administrator since 2015, among the other duties of the secretary of state. For more than a decade prior, Simon represented a west metro House district in the Legislature. 
During his time in office, Simon has battled against election misinformation among the public and high-ranking elected officials. He has refused to comply with Trump administration requests for voter rolls, calling the requests unconstitutional. 
At the 2022 state DFL convention, Simon spoke briefly about how his great-grandfather, a Lithuanian Jew, wound up in America. 
“He didn’t just emigrate to America. He fled. He fled discrimination and persecution. He was what today we would call a refugee. The year before he left for America, Jews in the Russian empire lost the right to vote.” 
Simon announced in December he would seek a fourth term as secretary of state.

Keith Ellison represented Minneapolis in Congress for 12 years before winning a narrow election to become the state’s top legal officer in 2018. In 2022, he won re-election by less than 1 percentage point. 
Ellison was the first Black person elected to statewide office and the first Muslim elected to any statewide office in the United States.
As attorney general, Ellison has taken on cases against gun manufacturers, TikTok and negligent landlords. He is part of a cohort of blue-state attorneys general that is fighting the Trump administration in the courts, suing dozens of times on a range of issues including funding cuts, trans athlete bans and immigration status checks in federal programs. 
Ellison said in October he would seek a third term as attorney general.

She received a BA in Art from Elmira College, in Elmira New York where she met Larry.  She completed an MA at the College of Saint Rose. After graduating she began her teaching career at the Bement school in Deerfield, Mass. and continued at the Montessori School of Albany.  After a series of international adventures in the late 1970’s (midnight crossing from East Berlin through Checkpoint Charlie, and in Britain, a mistaken identity as a member of the Baeder-Meinhof gang) and travel (Britain, Holland, Germany) she married Larry to move to Montréal.
After three years in Québec, both were ready to return to the States, and they chose to move to Burlington, Vermont area where they made their home for the past 40 years. Martha taught Art at Richmond Elementary School for 10 years. She had a second career teaching basic skills to adult learners and New Americans at Vermont Adult Learning.
Martha was predeceased by her parents Elizabeth (Baggerly) and Paul Colyer.
She leaves her husband Larry Keyes, his brother Philip and Phil’s wife Laura and their children, Tor and Christopher. She leaves her sister Nancy Buckley and her Nancy’s children Peter, Elizabeth, David and Sarah and eight grand nieces and nephews. She also leaves her cousins Joanne, Betty, Liz and Andrea.
Martha and Larry were married for 43 years, and were together for much of 10 years prior to getting married. For Larry, Martha was his “Lebensgefährtin”, “the person with whom I traveled through life”. 
Martha has many life-long friends from childhood and from teaching.  Many are far away, but she maintained a regular correpondance with cards, calls and emails. Margaret Sansone, Michéle Dominy, Cassie Keith, Leslie Knauf, Carmine Sargent, Lee Hollister and many others.
The family would like to thank the staff of the University of Vermont’s Cancer Center, and UVM Hospice. A very special thanks to Margaret Sansone… who with Larry, took loving care of her during her last days.

(Photo provided by SC Department of Motor Vehicles)COLUMBIA — When getting new license plates, South Carolina residents can choose — at no additional cost — to brag about the state’s role in winning the Revolutionary War.
Department of Motor Vehicles offices across the state began offering the commemorative plate last week as one of its two standard options, coinciding with this year’s 250th anniversary of the country’s founding.
The tag replaced the decade-old, blue-and-white plate with the state’s motto, “While I breathe, I hope,” printed above a Palmetto tree. Those license plates will remain valid until their expiration date, according to the DMV.
As per state law requiring the switch, the American Revolution tag will remain the state’s regular plate through December 2032, the 250th anniversary of the British completing their evacuation of occupied Charleston, which ended the war in the Carolinas.
Drivers can still opt for the license plate reading, “In God we trust,” with an American flag and Palmetto flag flying.
The new plate, which is nearly identical to one available by request since Jan. 1, 2022, includes an illustration of Sgt. William Jasper retrieving Fort Sullivan’s flag during the Battle of Sullivan’s Island in 1776. As the British Royal Navy bombarded the fort, Jasper grabbed the fallen flag, replaced its pole with a cannon gunner’s staff, and replanted it.
Known as the Moultrie Flag, it’s depicted on the license plate with a white crescent in one corner — copying the original flag — and the word “LIBERTY” in all caps across the bottom, which didn’t exist on the flag 250 years ago.
The only difference between the new, standard plate and the 2022 special plate is the words across the top.
The plate available for the last three years read, “250 Year Anniversary Revolutionary War.” The new one reads, “Where the Revolutionary War Was Won.”
After success at State Fair, SC250 considers how to show exhibit year-round

“It’s recognizable, and it’s one of those things where, if it’s not broken, don’t fix it,” said Molly Fortune, executive director of the SC250 Commission.
The change in wording to take credit for the nation’s independence was a late addition by the state Senate in the legislation signed by Gov. Henry McMaster last May. Senators pointed to the more than 200 skirmishes and battles fought in the state, including multiple significant fights, in proposing the tagline, which passed both the House and Senate unanimously.
Historians cite the decisive Patriot victory at South Carolina’s Battle of Cowpens in 1781 as laying the groundwork for the surrender at Yorktown in Virginia nine months later. Thomas Jefferson called the Battle of Kings Mountain in 1780 “the turn of the tide of success.”
Rep. Neal Collins, an Easley Republican and the law’s main sponsor, has seen some debate online about the accuracy of calling South Carolina the place the war was won, since the final major land battle took place hundreds of miles away. That discussion is a good thing, he said.
“Hopefully that’ll get people to crack open a book or ChatGPT it and get some answers,” Collins said.
As long as people are learning about the state’s role in the Revolutionary War, the plates are serving their purpose, said Collins, who also proposed the 2021 law creating the previous special plates.
South Carolina has plenty of Revolutionary War stories, much like the other states involved, Collins said: “It’s just that over the years we haven’t marketed it as well.”
Much of the celebration for the country’s sestercentennial will center around July 4 to mark the adoption of the Declaration of Independence, but that “was really just sort of a beginning of an era,” Collins said.
The 2022 plates are still available upon request. Unlike other specialized plates, which show off emblems for businesses, nonprofits and universities, the special Revolutionary War plates are available at no additional cost, according to the DMV.
There are 1,667 of the 2022 special license plates in circulation, said DMV spokesman Mike Fitts.

(Photo by Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Jordan Chessher senses an urgency surrounding an effort to increase the criminal penalties in Kansas for child endangerment.
Fatal and near-fatal cases involving children across Kansas have stuck with him “because warning signs were missed, oversight failed or the law lacked the strength to intervene early and decisively,” he wrote in a Dec. 20 open letter to news outlets.
A bill filed in the Kansas House ahead of the 2026 legislative session may address his concerns. House Bill 2412 seeks to increase penalties for people convicted of child endangerment or aggravated child endangerment if their crimes involve children younger than 6 years old.
Chessher is the cofounder of Project Heaven, a Wichita-based grassroots group advocating for legislative changes to prevent child abuse. He said the bill, if passed into law, could save children’s lives.
“This legislation is not about punishment alone — it is about deterrence, accountability, and prevention,” he said.
Child endangerment applies when a person “knowingly and unreasonably” allows a child younger than 18 years old “to be placed in a situation in which the child’s life, body or health may be endangered,” according to state law. Aggravated child endangerment applies to the same situation but when a person recklessly causes or allows a child to potentially be placed in danger.
Typically, those situations involve drug manufacturing or use.
For children younger than 6 years old, the bill proposes upping child endangerment from a misdemeanor to a felony.
Sara Hortenstine, executive director of the Kansas State Child Death Review Board, said the board consistently has found that infants and young children are at heightened risk for serious injury and death.
That’s often because of their developmental stage, physical dependency on their caregivers, and a limited ability to seek help and protect themselves, she said.
“Recognizing this vulnerability helps ensure accountability is proportionate to the level of risk and dependency involved and supports enhanced safeguards for very young children,” Hortenstine said.
The review board sits within the Kansas Attorney General’s Office and acts as a citizen panel responsible for gauging whether state and local agencies are adequately protecting children by reviewing every child death in the state. The results of the board’s evaluation are published in an annual report.
The board’s most recent report examined deaths that occurred in 2023. Of the 361 children who died in Kansas in 2023, a toxicology screening was performed for 180 of them. There were 24 detections of marijuana, 16 of fentanyl and nine of alcohol, according to the report.
Nearly half of the 221 sleep-related sudden, unexpected infant deaths in Kansas between 2019 and 2023 involved a parent or caregiver with a history of substance use. In 12 instances, a caregiver was under the influence at the time of a child’s sleep-related death, the report said.
In more than half of all child deaths during that time period, a parent or caregiver had prior or current involvement with child protective services, according to the report.
The board outlines each year a series of public policy recommendations to improve child death investigations, enhance data collection and prevent future child deaths. Many have reappeared year after year. Modifying child endangerment statutes was not one of the recommendations featured in the 2025 report, but Hortenstine said the bill enhances legal protections for young children.
Rep. Ken Collins, a Republican and convenience store owner in Mulberry, filed the bill on Dec. 10.
In 2024, a high-profile, unlicensed day care incident led to permanent medical conditions for then-4-month-old Benny Cannon in Pittsburg, near Collins’ district.
Two day care attendants who left Cannon alone in a bouncer were sentenced earlier this year. One pleaded guilty to aggravated battery, two counts of child endangerment, aggravated child endangerment, marijuana possession and drug paraphernalia possession, according to court records. She served 60 days in jail and was given 18 months of probation along with mandatory substance use treatment and restitution payment requirement. The other pleaded guilty to three counts of child endangerment, served 30 days in jail, was given 18 months of probation and must pay restitution.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Statehouse-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-06 09:58:46.251936
,CommonWealth Beacon,2026-01-06 14:13:35+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,Mass. insurer of last resort wrestles with thorny questions around affordability,Jordan Wolman,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/environment/mass-insurer-of-last-resort-wrestles-with-thorny-questions-around-affordability/,"Now, after the FAIR Plan saw its largest single-year jump in 2024 in new enrollees in two decades, the plan will need to decide this year whether it wants to raise the rates it charges — something that hasn’t happened in 20 years.","MASSACHUSETTS MAY BE faring better than other states in riding out turbulence in the home insurance industry, but its insurer of last resort is being forced to confront the affordability of its own coverage amid a reckoning across the state over the high cost of living. 
Rising home insurance prices around the country and in New England, driven by increasing climate risk and higher rebuilding costs due to inflation and tariffs, are accelerating the FAIR Plan’s next critical juncture. 
Already, the FAIR Plan’s premiums have gone up 11 percent between 2019 and 2023 even without a rate hike, and last year it increased the amount of coverage new policyholders are required to purchase. 
Now, after the FAIR Plan saw its largest single-year jump in 2024 in new enrollees in two decades, the plan will need to decide this year whether it wants to raise the rates it charges — something that hasn’t happened in 20 years. 
“This is the tension between getting everybody insurance and what that costs,” said Charlie Sidoti, a former insurance executive who now serves as executive director of the Cambridge-based nonprofit InnSure, which works with insurers and communities navigating climate risk. “Either way, people are screwed. If the premiums provide the coverage people need in case disaster strikes, but they can’t afford it, that causes strain. If the coverage is inadequate but affordable, there’s a protection gap that could really hurt people and whole communities during the next catastrophe event.” 
Last year, the FAIR Plan, which provides home insurance for those unable to get it in the private market, launched a new requirement to raise the amount of coverage new policyholders must purchase. Those enrollees must now buy insurance that covers at least 90 percent of the reconstruction cost of their home, up from 80 percent.  
Frank O’Brien, the FAIR Plan’s general counsel, said in an interview that most other private insurers now also require coverage of at least 90 percent of the reconstruction cost and “we didn’t want to be inconsistent with the marketplace.” 
That reflects a growing tension: whether the insurer of last resort should continue to be both widely available and affordable amid rising prices and nonrenewals from private insurers. While being so accessible would help more people get needed coverage, it could also concentrate risk within the FAIR Plan among coastal properties, which are most vulnerable to severe damages from flooding, high winds, and other forms of extreme weather.  
Such a scenario would disproportionately saddle the FAIR Plan with massive losses should a major storm hit Cape Cod and Plymouth and Bristol counties. Those areas now account for 55 percent of all FAIR Plan enrollees. 
O’Brien said the decision to raise the amount of coverage new enrollees must purchase was essentially made with these tradeoffs in mind.  
“We made that change because we were growing,” he said. “And one of the concerns is that when you have a large and growing residual market, which is what the FAIR Plan is, that’s a sign that the market is not as healthy as it should be. Our ability to do things that would slow growth down is pretty limited. One of the things that we looked at, however, was this requirement. It’s not a good thing when somebody’s under-insured — when something bad happens, they get the check and can’t go rebuild their house with it.” 
The next decision in the FAIR Plan’s hunt for the affordability sweet spot will be more dramatic and impact far more people. 
A two-year ban on the FAIR Plan being able to file for a rate increase will lift in March. Any rate changes would need approval from the state division of insurance, and the FAIR Plan agreed to the two-year prohibition in 2024 as part of a package of reforms it made in coordination with regulators.  
O’Brien declined to say whether or not the plan would request a rate hike, saying that “we’re constantly evaluating where we are in the marketplace” and that it “depends on a lot of circumstances” like the plan’s costs and claims.  
The last time the FAIR Plan filed for a rate increase, in 2013, the insurance division denied it. A rate increase would likely impact all policyholders within the FAIR Plan and would be a recognition that the base cost of coverage is going up due to a higher potential for climate-driven disasters and increased repair costs. 
The churn at the FAIR Plan, accelerated by a spike in enrollment in 2024 and the expiration of the ban on a rate increase, shows how the insurer of last resort is navigating a time of change in the industry. 
The Bay State, though, is in a better spot than others. A number of private insurers remain competing for business in Massachusetts, unlike in states like California and Florida, where several companies exited altogether in the wake of catastrophic wildfires and hurricanes that prompted dramatic spikes in enrollees in their insurers of last resort. 
And the 11 percent increase in FAIR Plan premiums in Massachusetts between 2019 and 2023 is still far lower than other states’ insurers of last resort, including the 393 percent jump in California, the 116 percent spike in Georgia, the 735 percent increase in Louisiana and the 18 percent hike in Rhode Island.  
Insurance in the private market is also likely more expensive since the FAIR Plan last raised rates in 2006, though premiums have gone up in the plan despite rates remaining flat because of increases both in the risk for individual properties and of property values over time. 
One tweak that the Massachusetts FAIR Plan made years ago struck right at the heart of the tug-of-war over affordability for homeowners now versus ensuring they can rebuild later in the event of a major loss – and it’s stirring controversy today. 
In 2019, the FAIR Plan changed wording in its manual for agents and brokers that required homeowners to purchase insurance based on their home’s reconstruction cost, which is more of a “worse case scenario” of what it would take to rebuild a replica of a home after a loss, including demolition or debris removal and higher labor and material costs.  
Buying insurance based on the reconstruction cost can be more expensive than buying it based on the replacement cost, which doesn’t take those factors into account, but could offer a more accurate representation of the price of rebuilding a home after a disaster and thereby grant the homeowner better protection. (The FAIR Plan’s policy terms for home insurance, however, references replacement costs as the level to which a home must be insured.) 
Frank Lombard, a Chicopee-based independent insurance adviser, has complained to the FAIR Plan that that switch in wording paved the way for what he views as unnecessarily high insurance costs for policyholders above what the policy terms require, according to emails viewed by CommonWealth Beacon.
For two of Lombard’s clients, according to valuation documents, the difference between the replacement cost and reconstruction cost of the homes was roughly $193,000 and $644,000, respectively. The disparity between purchasing insurance based on the replacement cost and the reconstruction cost, then, would account for the significant increase in premiums those clients shouldered, he argued. 
Lombard said he has no doubt private insurers are following the same practice. The difference, he said, is that people enrolled in the FAIR Plan have nowhere else to go for coverage. 
“They’re inflating the amount of coverage that’s required,” Lombard said in an interview. “In some cases, these are retired people, or elderly households. It’s not fair.” 
O’Brien denied that that change had any impact on the premiums people are paying, arguing that the FAIR Plan treats those terms as interchangeable. He pointed to policy language that states the plan will “repair or replace” the damaged home after a loss, which O’Brien says essentially renders moot any difference between the terms. Premiums, he added, can change for any number of reasons. 
There’s some divergence among insurance experts about whether the wording in the agent’s manual would have an impact on the amount of coverage provided and the corresponding premiums that homeowners pay. 
Tristan Hormann, executive director of the Washington state FAIR Plan, said replacement and reconstruction costs are, in his experience, used interchangeably, especially when there is the “repair or replace” clause in the policy like there is in Massachusetts. 
Chris Stark, executive director of the Massachusetts Insurance Federation, said although the reconstruction cost is generally a more specific value that incorporates more of what it would cost to rebuild a damaged or destroyed home, the disparity in definitions between the terms could look different in practice: In many cases, Stark said, the two values may be similar. But the reconstruction cost of a historic Victorian-style home could be much higher than the replacement cost of that home, for instance, since there could be a large difference in costs between simply building a new home of similar square footage and building that home with today’s prices with identical Victorian style and materials. 
Still, even if it costs more to maintain coverage based on the reconstruction value, the homeowner gets more in return, he said. 
“This is likely a balance of solvency and ensuring the proper coverage for homeowners by the FAIR Plan, as was the decision to require more coverage for new policyholders, and eventually any decision to raise rates will be one, too,” he said. “We always have to balance solvency with consumer protection. In this instance, you actually are getting more protection for these changes.”  
And the FAIR Plan’s choice to use the reconstruction cost value in determining the coverage offered and the corresponding required premium is emblematic of the insurer’s larger tensions, Stark said. The plan is trying to keep insurance affordable in an era of soaring premiums while raising the level of protection for homeowners so they can be made whole should disaster strike and ensuring that the plan has the capital it needs to cover that risk and pay those claims, he added.  
“All of this is about addressing the delta that people have between what they are insured for versus what it would cost to get that home back into its pre-loss condition,” Stark said. “It’s a careful balance of having consumer access to affordable and available insurance products while at the same time making sure that they’re not risking their solvency. Collectively, these are all various decisions that help maintain that balance as much as possible with affordability always in mind, especially for the insurer of last resort.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Climate_Flooding_House_Lowell.png?fit=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-06 09:58:46.251936

People are trickling in for lunch, served every weekday to Missourians 60 and older for an optional donation. One person asks about the soup of the day, while another donates a stack of Sunday papers. There are coupons for baby formula inside, she explains, in case anyone has family who could use them.
“Seniors need socialization,” said Diana Asher of Holts Summit, who has been attending the lunches a few times a week since moving from California in June. “Most people are busy. Seniors tend to end up alone at home one way or another, even if they have a spouse.”

Rebecca Nowlin, CEO of Aging Best, said the nonprofit, which is central Missouri’s area agency on aging, was able to keep offering all of its services throughout the 2025 federal government shutdown. But to cope with delayed reimbursements, it instituted a hiring freeze and expanded the waitlist for home chore services.
Funding delays during the shutdown forced other area agencies on aging to also cut back services or furlough staff, causing lasting harm to the agencies and the older Missourians who rely on them, agency leaders said.
Now Missouri’s 10 area agencies on aging are facing more uncertainty. Federal funding for the Older Americans Act, currently sustained by the same legislation that ended the shutdown in November, is set to expire on Jan. 30. 
“These are dollars and funds which for more than 50 years have been stable funding in the community to help seniors with day to day needs, so that they don’t have to go into a nursing home,” said Anneliese Stoever, director of the St. Louis Area Agency on Aging.
The federal law, enacted in 1965, established a national network of area agencies on aging to connect older Americans with services to help them stay safe and healthy in their homes. 
In Missouri, those services include free or subsidized home-delivered and community meals, transportation to medical appointments, to buy groceries or visit family, home modifications like grab bars and relief for family caregivers. 
All agencies have now been reimbursed for services they offered while Congress was deadlocked, said Lisa Cox, a spokesperson for the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, which administers state and federal funds for the agencies. 
Cox said in an email to The Independent that the federal government has always come through with funding for the agencies.
“This has happened in the past, and funding has always continued,” Cox said. “There has been no cut to the funding to date.”
But since it takes four to eight weeks for funding to be processed at the federal and state levels after a shutdown, some agencies have only recently been reimbursed for services they provided while Congress was deadlocked.
Stoever said at the end of December that the agency was “just now receiving the dollars that are flowing as a result of the last government shutdown.”
And as agencies fight to build up their cash reserves to protect against future funding delays, some services haven’t resumed.
Most Thursdays since the end of October, there have been no weekly hot meals at the Cameron Lunch Club Senior Center.
Penny Crawford, CEO of Young at Heart Resources, the area agency on aging for northwest Missouri, said the group meals it hosted in Cameron attracted 60 to 70 people before the shutdown.
Now the Cameron senior center only serves lunches when there’s a private donation — like when a client donated $1,000 to fund a Thanksgiving lunch, complete with turkey, mashed potatoes, green bean casserole and pumpkin pie.
“She said, ‘I have to have my Thanksgiving meal here. It’s the only way I get Thanksgiving,” Crawford said. “So she [got] everyone a Thanksgiving meal, and she got to be with people.”
 Home and community-based services

Stacy Morse, executive director of the Missouri Council on Aging, said that by improving health outcomes among older Missourians, services provided by the agencies save the state money and reduce stress on rural hospitals. 
Morse added that stable Older Americans Act funding is crucial in addition to short-term sources of federal investment, like the Rural Health Transformation Program passed by Congress this summer as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. 
Missouri has been awarded more than $216 million for fiscal year 2026 through the program, one of five potential years of funding. With the money, Missouri proposed expanding a pilot project called ToRCH, or Transformation of Rural Community Health, that put six rural hospitals in charge of local health initiatives and enabled medical and community providers to get Medicaid compensation for a broader range of preventative services.
Morse said that in order to take advantage of a future outcome-based Medicaid payment system, Missouri needs reliable support for services that keep people healthy.
Cheryl Lee, of Lamar, Missouri, for years received meal and grocery deliveries from the Region X Area Agency on Aging. Services from the agency enabled her to die at home instead of in a nursing home (photo submitted).
“We need the Older Americans Act money to support home and community-based services in order to make the ToRCH program successful,” Morse said.
Nowlin said staff of area agencies on aging, including Aging Best, are experts in connecting clients with services in their communities.
“I don’t think anybody else out there probably has the expertise of some of our people,” Nowlin said. “If you call us, they know who to talk to.”
Jennifer Shotwell, CEO of Region X Area Agency on Aging in Joplin, said meal and grocery deliveries are the only way some older Missourians can access nutritious food, especially in rural areas.
Shotwell said Cheryl Lee, a client from Barton County, for years depended on meals and groceries from the agency. The agency even delivered food for her cats.
Where she lived, outside of Lamar, Shotwell said, “they don’t have delivery. They don’t have DoorDash, no Uber.”
“We did our job,” Shotwell said, “because she passed away at home where she wanted to be and not in a nursing home.”
Morse said these services provide a lifeline to older Missourians who use them.
“Just think, for one day, what that would be like to not have access to food,” Morse said, “to not have access to transportation, to not have anybody to help you, whether it’s to open your medicine bottles or take you to the bathroom to get cleaned up.”
 Funding stress

Even without federal disruptions funding has not kept pace with increased costs and demand as Missourians age, said Julie Peetz, executive director of the Missouri Association of Area Agencies on Aging.
“I had one [agency leader] tell me recently, ‘I don’t have any more rabbits to pull out of my hat,” Peetz said. “I just can’t do more. There’s no fallback anymore.”
The total state and federal funding Missouri’s agencies received increased by only 15% from fiscal years 2019-2024, from $40.8 million to $47.1 million, according to data provided to The Independent by the association, though there were spikes due to supplementary funding during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Cox, the spokesperson for the state’s health and senior services department, said about 71% of Missouri’s funding for the agencies for fiscal year 2026, or $30.1 million, comes from the federal government. 
The agencies have begun to benefit from a state tax on insurance premiums passed by Missouri lawmakers in 2019 to help fund home and community-based services. But that new funding stream was intended to supplement existing funding sources, not replace federal contributions.
Shotwell said that during the shutdown, her agency could only keep offering lunches at its six senior centers thanks to private donations and loans from several city governments.
“I couldn’t keep assuming expenses if I had no idea when we were going to be reimbursed,” Shotwell said.
Shotwell said the agency, which serves Barton, Jasper, Newton and McDonald counties, has had to place about 40 people on a wait list for home-delivered meals.
Crawford’s agency, which serves 18 northwestern counties, furloughed half of its staff and halved its in-home services. The agency cut its program to help clients navigate Medicaid eligibility recertifications and paused transportation services.
Peetz said some furloughed staff quit.
“They’re not going to wait around a month or two months to see if they’ll have a job,” Peetz said.
Between staff losses and services that were cut, Peetz said the shutdown did “permanent damage” to agencies “and most of all to the clients.”
Stoever said her agency, one of two in Missouri that are part of a local government, was able to sustain its services throughout the shutdown partly through support from the city of St. Louis. Most agencies in the state are nonprofits.
The agency collaborated with the antipoverty and disaster relief organization Convoy of Hope to distribute 965 cases of food across 10 senior center food pantries to meet heightened demand due to the pause of monthly food benefits through the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, Stoever said. 
About 22% of Missouri’s 1.1 million residents 65 or older receive SNAP benefits, according to the state’s Department of Health and Senior Services.
As a result of the delays in federal benefits, Stoever said, the agency delivered 3,325 emergency meal boxes in November.
 Lasting effects

Agency leaders said they are adjusting their financial planning in anticipation of more frequent funding delays. 
Stoever said that due to funding uncertainty, she’s had to tell contractors and community partners that while she doesn’t anticipate cutting their funding in the coming fiscal year, she can’t increase it either. 
Shotwell said her agency is trying to increase its cash reserves, aiming to have six months in the bank rather than three. 
“Previous to this shutdown,” she said, “if I had more than three months’ worth of my expenses in the bank, I’m doing a horrible job as a nonprofit. My job is to turn dollars into services to help older adults live independently and with dignity.”
But Shotwell said the shutdown — along with inflation and increasing labor costs as Missouri has increased the minimum wage — have demanded a “paradigm shift.”
Shotwell said she is “constantly chasing grant money and fundraising” to accumulate carryover funds.
But that won’t ultimately be enough, she said.
“We can’t keep up the pace we’re at without an investment in the [Older Americans] Act,” Shotwell said.
Morse said it isn’t sustainable for Congress to keep funding area agencies on aging through temporary spending measures, called continuing resolutions. 
“We need to stop this continuing resolution business and get a budget so that [the agencies] have some defined numbers and stability,” she said.
Nowlin said that even though reimbursements from the shutdown have come through, Aging Best is still being careful with funds.
They haven’t lifted the hiring freeze yet. And the agency has plans to install a permanent LED sign in front of the new senior center, but it’s had to wait.

Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, speaks at an Aug. 4, 2025, news conference in her Anchorage office. (Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)It was an eventful year in national politics, and Alaska’s senior senator was often in the spotlight for bucking the Republican Party or the Trump administration.
She sat down with veteran Alaska reporter Nathaniel Herz of the Northern Journal to reflect on the last year and look forward into 2026 — in a conversation that ranges from federal funding for public broadcasting to Alaska’s 2026 U.S. Senate election to transboundary mining.
The Alaska Beacon is republishing this edited transcript of their conversation.
Nathaniel Herz: Have you seen these t-shirts yet, with this quote from you?
Lisa Murkowski: I’m looking at it. What is it? Oh, yeah. It says, ‘What’s woke about the birthday line?’
Right? What’s woke about the Talk of Alaska Merry Christmas greeting (show) today?
Nathaniel Herz: My understanding is, the genesis of these t-shirts was that you were at the public media station in Bethel, in Western Alaska, KYUK. And that this was maybe a cheeky question that you posed about their Birthday Line program, in the context of critics saying that public media is woke and liberal.
Lisa Murkowski: I’m like, ‘Yeah, really?’
Nathaniel Herz: Because the Birthday Line is, like, people calling in and wishing people happy birthday?
Lisa Murkowski: Mm hmm. ‘I want to wish my auntie in Aniak a happy birthday.’ ‘I want to wish my brother Tom downriver a happy birthday.’
Nathaniel Herz: And your point was, ‘This is not anti-Trump. This is not anti-whatever’?
Lisa Murkowski: This is not radical, woke, leftist bias. It’s just not. And people in the Lower 48 only wish that they had fun things like the Birthday Line. We could transform America with the birthday line.
Nathaniel Herz: I had a question about public media, which was effectively close to zeroed out in the federal budget last year. It seems like a lot of people had their minds made up about this issue while it was being debated. But I was questioning whether the argument that folks were making about the need and value of public broadcasting was the right one. Because there was this big emphasis on emergencies. But today, everyone gets tsunami alerts on their phones. Was there a more compelling argument than the one you guys were making that could have resonated more with folks?
Lisa Murkowski: You know, I don’t disagree with you. As I think back to how I was trying to get people, like, exercised about it — it was really convenient, oddly enough, to have had that massive earthquake over in Russia, and the impact on the tsunami.
But as I think about the real value — the real value is the ability to connect people within their communities.
I think particularly, the role that KYUK would have played in this whole (Western Alaska) typhoon incident. Yeah, we know that everybody from (the village of) Kipnuk is evacuated. But you have so many people, like: ‘Well, my brother was born here in Kipnuk, but he’s living down in Kasigluk.’ And the way that people just checked in with one another was by listening to public radio.
It’s not necessarily the Birthday Line. It’s like, oh, you knew the generator has been out in this town for two weeks now. So, you know that you’re going to call your brother and say, ‘How you doing?’
I think that’s the type of thing where, in Alaska, particularly, where you don’t have roads that connect people, this public media is your connector. It’s your communications connector. Maybe it’s been replaced a little bit by Facebook. I’m not a Facebooker, so I don’t know. But I think it’s the connections, and that’s why people in rural America understand, a little bit more, the value of public media. Because they, too, need those connections
Nathaniel Herz: There’s this year of funding through the Bureau of Indian Affairs that Alaska’s junior senator, Dan Sullivan, I think, helped make happen, which is supporting some Alaska stations.
Lisa Murkowski: It was (South Dakota Sen.) Mike Rounds who made it happen.
Nathaniel Herz: What’s your sense of the outlook for whether you can get Corporation for Public Broadcasting funding, or some sort of recurring federal funding, back for stations once that first year expires?
Lisa Murkowski: We are working to, kind of, reexamine, and we’ve been working directly with the corporation. They’ve got a big decision to make as to whether they even remain in existence. And my pitch to them — I actually talked with their board a couple of weeks ago — was like, ‘We know how we’re going to limp through this next year. But I need you to exist for a little bit longer, until we can figure out if we can get more predictable funding streams. If it’s a more reduced version of what we’re seeing at the federal level — which I believe it will be — but it is still somewhat reliable, then you can kind of piece in the other things after that.’
So, I am not convinced that it’s going to be through what the Bureau of Indian Affairs is doing. BIA actually called up the corporation and said, ‘We have no clue how to implement any of this.’ For lack of a better word, ‘Can we contract with you?’
I mean, this is how bizarre the whole thing is, and how stupid it is, and what a waste of money it was. But this is how they got Sen. Rounds to stand down from his opposition. ‘Your tribal stations, we’ll support them.’ But I think, initially, the commitment was going to be, they were going to support the tribal stations without a one year limitation. So, I think he kind of got ripped off, myself.
Nathaniel Herz: Did the junior senator from Alaska and the representative for all Alaskans miss an opportunity to be more outspoken and to have made an impact on the outcome here?
Lisa Murkowski: There were a lot of other issues that were going on. But this place was electric with the buzz about funding for public media. And I don’t think it was reserved just for the conversations that I was part of. It was a big deal. People would come in and they wanted to talk about health care, they wanted to talk about energy. And it was like, ‘Oh, and, don’t forget, this is important.’ So, I don’t know. I don’t understand how you can say you support public broadcasting and then you don’t support public broadcasting when it’s in front of you.
Nathaniel Herz: There has been a ton of speculation about Democratic former U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola and what she’s going to do, as far as running for Alaska governor or U.S. Senate. I’ve been hearing increasingly about the potential for her to run for Senate against Sullivan. What kind of position would that put you in, given that you work with Sullivan on a day-to-day basis but have also supported Peltola in the past?
Lisa Murkowski: Well, it’s not so much about me. That’s a hard race. Sen. Sullivan is coming up on finishing two terms, and not without significant successes. So, anybody who’s thinking about taking him on, I think, is setting themselves up for a very, very hard and a very expensive race.
You know, I made it very clear, when Nick Begich was running against Mary (in 2024) — I said, ‘No offense to you, Nick, but Mary has been my longtime friend, and I’m going to support her.’
If she were to run against my colleague, yeah: It puts me in a difficult spot. But I also think it puts a lot of Alaskans in a difficult spot. Mary, not unlike me, is able to attract support from both sides, right? And granted, it’s early right now. But my sense is that Dan is doing a pretty good job of shoring up this support from not only traditional Republican voters and donors, but from many who kind of view themselves more independently.
Nathaniel Herz: He’s trying to broaden his base a little bit.
Lisa Murkowski: I think that will put people in a spot where it’s like, ‘Yes, I may have supported you (Peltola) when you were running for the House. But we’ve got a different scenario here.’ So, I think it would be hard. I think it’d be really hard.
Nathaniel Herz: Do you feel like you could say at this point whether you’d support Mary if she made that decision?
Lisa Murkowski: No, I can’t say that I would support, no.
My hope is that we have an election where we recognize the value of the individuals that are running, the contributions that they’ve made, and we don’t get into this nasty, going-at-one-another’s-throats campaigns. I really don’t want to see that. I don’t think Alaskans want to see that.
Nathaniel Herz: Would you like to see Mary run?
Lisa Murkowski: For Senate, for governor, for house?
Nathaniel Herz: For Senate.
Lisa Murkowski: I think it would be a very, very, very hard race. I think it’d be hard on people in this state. And again, I don’t like the idea of, just, a really nasty, nasty race at the Senate level. I have said many times very publicly that Mary is my friend. I want Mary to do what’s going to make Mary happy. And only Mary can determine that.
Nathaniel Herz: My sense, from having done some reporting on her choices here, and from reading others’ reporting on it, is that there is very clearly a dynamic when it comes to the national Democrats that have pushed her to run for U.S. Senate. And that perspective is not about Mary, it’s not about Alaska, it’s about the big picture sort of politics.
Lisa Murkowski: Just put a name to it. (U.S. Senate Democratic leader) Chuck Schumer would like to be in the majority. And he’s got to figure out where he picks up more votes. And so, the pressure to get a Democrat who has that level of notoriety, public support — he’s going to weigh in and promise, probably, the sun, the moon and the stars to her.
But it’s one thing to go through a campaign. I have said many times, you know, ‘Well, I may not always agree with some of the decisions that come out of the Trump administration, or from my Republican leadership.’ I have no desire or design or intention of being in a caucus that is led by Chuck Schumer.
I think it would be hard. I think it would be really, really hard for Mary Peltola, or any Democrat from Alaska, to be in a caucus like we currently have with Schumer as the leader over there. I don’t think it would work for any Alaskan.
Nathaniel Herz: Change of subject. We’ve been doing some reporting on transboundary mines — those on the Canadian side of the border, in watersheds that flow into Alaska. You’ve been pretty consistent in your support for resource development inside Alaska, and haven’t necessarily expressed those same kinds of concerns about mining projects here, even as others have expressed concerns about them.
What’s different about these projects in Canada compared to the ones in Alaska that are making you feel more compelled to speak on behalf of folks who are concerned about them?
Lisa Murkowski: It’s an easy question, and the answer is, Tulsequah Chief. (Tulsequah Chief is an abandoned mine in Canada that has been leaching pollution into a watershed that drains into Alaska.)
For how many years? Well, it’s been at least 25, because I was in the state Legislature when I first heard of what we were dealing with, coming from the Canadian side. And not only a level of contamination that was basically left unchecked, but just a whole series of finger pointing. Promises that they were going to address it, and no delivery.
In that instance, we saw, just, a complete failure, and a failure that went on for decades to the point where, in British Columbia, they know that they have got to address it. They know that for projects going forward, they’re kind of stained by the operation there, and so they’re making the same promises, ‘Our environmental regulations are tough. We’re going to be good stewards.’ But it’s really hard when they have failed to keep their word.
I look to the requirements that we have on our side of the border. They’re much more stringent than the Canadians’. And so, I think that’s where you have the difference.
We made some headway during the Walker administration, when Byron Mallott was lieutenant governor. I think we had a real good level of communication going on for the first time in a while. (But) we’ve kind of pulled back from that. And it’s been tough to get the U.S. State Department involved. And I don’t feel like we’re going to have that much luck with this particular State Department, so we’re exploring other ways to get the attention of Canada on, just, the obligations.
Nathaniel Herz: Like what?
Lisa Murkowski: I mean, noodling. Maybe we incorporate some things on, you know, from a tariff perspective. We’ve been doing kind of the same thing for a while, and we haven’t really gotten the attention to it.
Nathaniel Herz: The idea being that tariffs are a tool that could be used to get their attention.
Lisa Murkowski: Yeah. And we haven’t explored it any further than that. But again, we’re just kind of spitballing.
Nathaniel Herz: It’s an idea. It’s not legislation that’s drafted.
Lisa Murkowski: Yeah.
Nathaniel Herz: I get the sense that you experienced a lot of pressure, and had to do a lot of work, in this past year. And I’m just curious, looking back on it, if you would say this was the most difficult year you’ve experienced in D.C., or if you wouldn’t go that far.
Lisa Murkowski: I don’t know if it’s been the most difficult year. But I can tell you that I am so happy to be having the door of 2025 close on my butt, and I’m done with it.
It has been — it’s been a challenging year, and a lot of it has to do with, just, the unknowns that were in front of us. You have a new administration coming in, and that’s always different. But there was just a lot that was coming before us that caused anxiety with a lot of people — whether it’s anxiety about, you know, ‘My health insurance is going to triple in cost, and so I’m stressed out about that.’ Or, you know, ‘We’re in the middle of a government shutdown, and I’m having to work, but I’m not getting paid, and it’s costing me 100 bucks to fill up my truck to get into work, and I still have to pay childcare.’ And the uncertainty that comes about when you had all of the DOGE rifts early on, and people not knowing what their situation was going to be.
We received all of that, as incoming. People wanting answers on their grants, to know whether or not they needed to lay off an extra staff person, or whether something is coming in. And it was hard. It was just, emotionally, a hard year for a lot of Alaskans. And maybe it’s because I’m a very empathetic person: I don’t want people to be anxious that way. I don’t want them to be suffering. I don’t want them to feel like this is a really bad place for them, their family. And so, I kind of absorbed a lot of that, to kind of carry it. And so, it’s been a hard year, because there’s just been so much uncertainty.
Nathaniel Herz: Does it push you one way or the other, as far as your desire to do this for another six years when we get to 2028 and your re-election?
Lisa Murkowski: It’s hard, because the harder the job is, the more you realize why it’s so important that you’re there doing the hard job, if that makes any sense. It just does.
I take really seriously the responsibility that I have to the Constitution, to the oath of office that I have made. And that sounds maybe a little bit old fashioned. But I don’t get to sit in this office just because we pay the rent every month. It is a privilege that has been given, because people have asked me to try to help them. And part of that means that you have to stand up for what you think is right.
And when an administration of your own party is doing something that either you don’t feel is right, or you don’t feel comports with their authorities under the Constitution, there’s a responsibility to stand up. And that can be hard.

The top artificial intelligence and tech companies in California may be swimming in cash for now, but as skepticism grows over whether this current AI boom will continue or bust, so do concerns over the state’s budget and its reliance on the AI industry.
As CalMatters’ Levi Sumagaysay explains, California’s biggest source of revenue is personal income tax. In addition to base wages, many tech companies pay employees in stock options, which when fully vested and owned by employees are treated like ordinary income for tax purposes. Companies pay withholding taxes on some of that income to the state and U.S. governments.
The revenue paid from these taxes by some of the state’s biggest tech companies is expected to make up about 10% of all income tax withholding this year, according to the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office. As California faces a projected $18 billion deficit this year (more on that below), the state’s financial outlook is partly tied to these AI companies.

Chas Alamo, LAO’s principal fiscal and policy analyst: “We’re seeing a real boost to income-tax receipts because of this — for a relatively small number of employees. If the AI market were to deteriorate, we could see these withholdings decline.”

That’s because other aspects of California’s economy, such as job growth and wages, remain stagnant or are declining: In September California’s unemployment rate rose to the highest in the country, and from 2024 to 2025, the number of Bay Area tech jobs decreased. Some tech companies, such as San Francisco-based Salesforce, cite AI as a reason why they must layoff employees. 

Jeff Bellisario, executive director of the think tank Bay Area Council Economic Institute: “Tech booms in the past have led to an employment boom. This doesn’t feel like that.”

Coming soon: The last Newsom budget

Speaking of the state budget, Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday will unveil his preliminary spending plan for 2026-27 — his last as California’s governor. With an $18 billion deficit projected for the fiscal year, how Newsom plans to handle the deficit could have notable implications for his expected presidential bid, writes CalMatters’ Yue Stella Yu.
The deficit is a result of the state’s escalating spending, federal funding cuts and rising economic insecurity under President Donald Trump. State Republicans and other Newsom critics also blame the deficit on Newsom’s mismanagement. 
To close the gap, state leaders could walk back some of last year’s funding commitments. Medi-Cal is also California’s most expensive program, though Newsom has not indicated whether he’ll target it for cuts. But as a lame-duck governor eyeing the presidency, Newsom would be even less inclined to enact major policy changes to address the state’s long-term budget issues, political strategists say.

Garry South, longtime Democratic consultant: “It’s not an uncommon occurrence in California for a departing governor to leave a note on the new governor’s desk that they’ve got a budget deficit.”

Most Altadena residents still displaced, still awaiting utility settlements

Utility company Southern California Edison has paid out just 82 victims of the Eaton Fire through its wildfire recovery compensation program, despite drawing in nearly 1,800 customers into the program, writes CalMatters’ Malena Carollo.
A year ago, the deadly wildfire killed 19 people and destroyed over 9,000 structures in Los Angeles County. About 80% of Altadena residents are estimated to still be displaced as of October. Though an official cause has yet to be determined, federal prosecutors cite faulty Edison equipment for the fire. 
To settle numerous lawsuits against the company, Edison launched a compensation program two months ago. Survivors have criticized the program for excluding some residents, underpaying others and requiring participants to waive their right to sue the company.
Edison offered a total of $34.4 million to settle the 82 claims, with half of the claims for total losses, and the others related to smoke and ash damage.

The Trump administration is attempting to drastically cut the amount of federal funds that can be spent on permanent housing for homeless individuals. CalMatters’ Marisa Kendall and video strategy director Robert Meeks have a video segment on why advocates say this move could force people out of housing, as part of our partnership with PBS SoCal. Watch it here.

California Voices
CalMatters columnist Dan Walters: As Newsom kicks off his last year as governor, California’s intractable issues not only serve as a potential drag on his presidential campaign, but they also color the campaigns of his would-be successors.
The attention brought to incarcerated firefighters during last year’s L.A.-area wildfires showed that people want to see second chances given to incarcerated people working to turn their lives around, writes Jose Angel Amezcua, a formerly incarcerated firefighter from Salinas.

How will he address it?,Yue Stella Yu,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2026/01/gavin-newsom-politics-budget-deficit/,"As Gov. Gavin Newsom prepares to release his spending plan this Friday, a projected $18 billion deficit awaits. Will he raise taxes or cut spending? Either could spell trouble for Newsom’s legacy.","In summary
As Gov. Gavin Newsom prepares to release his spending plan this Friday, a projected $18 billion deficit awaits. Will he raise taxes or cut spending? Either could spell trouble for Newsom’s legacy. 


In 2019, first-year Gov. Gavin Newsom inherited a state flush with cash. With a $21.4 billion budget surplus to play with, an ambitious Newsom invested billions in affordable housing, child care and health care expansion while paying down the state’s debt and shoring up reserves. 
The next governor won’t be that lucky.
When Newsom unveils his last spending plan as governor Friday, he will do so with the spectre of a projected $18 billion deficit — the result of the state’s fast-growing spending, federal funding losses and heightened economic uncertainties under President Donald Trump’s administration.
The deficit could balloon to $35 billion annually in the next few years if state leaders don’t pursue long-term solutions, namely making sustainable revenue increases or cutting spending, according to the Legislative Analyst’s Office, the nonpartisan fiscal adviser to lawmakers. 
But neither will be appealing options to Newsom and legislative leaders this year. 
They have repeatedly resisted increasing taxes on average Californians and high-income earners alike — a politically dicey pitch to make in a state with high tax rates and increasing revenue. Spending cuts are equally painful to swallow, especially for Democrats running for re-election in November who have fought to expand services, such as Medi-Cal, that may now be rolled back. 
For Newsom, a lame-duck governor with presidential aspirations, there is even less incentive to address the state’s long-term budget health through major policy changes, political strategists say. 
“It’s not an uncommon occurrence in California for a departing governor to leave a note on the new governor’s desk that they’ve got a budget deficit,” said longtime Democratic consultant Garry South.
But how Newsom tackles the structural deficit will almost certainly have implications for his expected presidential bid. State Republicans, such as Assemblymember David Tangipa of Fresno, are already blaming the budget problem on Newsom’s mismanagement. “A Newsom presidency would be a fiscal and governance disaster of historic proportions,” Tangipa wrote in a December op-ed.
It’s the fourth consecutive year in Newsom’s tenure that the state is projecting a deficit even as revenue grows. In the past, state Democratic leaders resorted to temporary fixes such as internal borrowing, deferring payments, one-time cuts and drawing from California’s rainy day fund to avoid cutting into the social safety net. 
But that cushion is deflating: The state’s reserve stands at $14 billion, half its peak balance, after two years of withdrawals. State leaders have borrowed more than $20 billion from other state funds, debts that will come due in later years. Continuing to rely on those options would leave the state “undeniably less prepared” for an economic downturn, the LAO warned. 
“Eventually you are going to run out of Band-aids,” said Steve Maviglio, a Democratic strategist who worked for then-Gov. Gray Davis during a massive budget deficit. “(Newsom) has used every trick in the book, and after a certain point, there’s nothing left.”
More health care cuts to come?
Newsom has not indicated whether he’ll consider cuts to Medi-Cal, the state’s primary health insurance program for low-income residents. But as the state’s most expensive program, it is an attractive target. More than half of the $200 billion program’s funding comes from the federal government. 
Last year, as Newsom and legislators scrambled to close a $12 billion budget gap, they froze new Medi-Cal enrollment for undocumented immigrants, charged immigrant enrollees a $30 monthly premium and delayed cutting certain benefits. The cost of Medi-Cal has been rising faster than expected, forcing the state Legislature to allocate $6.2 billion midyear to prevent a shortfall. 
The decision was contentious, with some health care advocates and Democratic lawmakers slamming their leaders for creating a “two-tiered health care system” that deemed immigrants less worthy of quality coverage. 
“That was an incredibly disappointing backslide,” said Amanda McAllister-Wallner, executive director of Health Access California, which advocates for universal health care.
This year, Trump’s budget reduced the federal government’s share of funding to Medi-Cal, requiring the state to pay more to provide the same benefits. California is projected to spend at least $1.3 billion more to implement that change, a figure that could reach $5 billion by fiscal year 2029-30, the LAO estimated.

Assemblymember Mia Bonta, an Oakland Democrat who chairs the Assembly Health Committee, said solving the state’s budget crunch shouldn’t come at the expense of health care.
“California needs its state and federal leaders to look for more innovative solutions to fill the gaps, make health care affordable, and keep our families healthy,” she said in a statement that did not offer specific alternatives. 
Any cuts to Medi-Cal could bring political consequences for Democrats who often pride themselves on expanding social services. Rolling back Medi-Cal could hurt Newsom’s legacy, too, since it was under him that the state began offering Medi-Cal to immigrants.
“Democrats are the party of expanding health care,” Maviglio said. “To slash it goes against everything they stand for.”
McAllister-Wallner acknowledged she isn’t optimistic about the budget outlook. But she said she hopes the state finds new revenue through taxing corporations instead of making cuts to vulnerable populations.
If “we are addressing this through cuts only, and cuts to the most vulnerable, that’s … not the leadership that we are looking for,” she said.
State leaders could also walk back some of last year’s funding commitments in other areas. While state lawmakers negotiated $500 million for homelessness to counties and delayed it until next year, it is not guaranteed. Newsom, who has blamed the state’s homelessness problem on local governments, could withhold the money. 
Newsom also promised last year he’d reach a deal with Bay Area transit advocates over state funding to save the area’s transit net from collapsing. But last month, in light of the budget shortfall, Newsom urged advocates to dip into previously allocated dollars to save the regional transit network, instead of a $750 million loan the advocates had requested.
Taxing the rich a nonstarter for Newsom
It’ll be hard to muster the political will in Sacramento to raise taxes. 
Former Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon, a Los Angeles Democrat running for state superintendent of public instruction, said he’s long supported higher taxes on industries that have “skated away from taxation for a long time.” 
But even the most progressive Democrats in California have had little appetite to raise taxes, he said, because many represent affluent areas such as Silicon Valley where their wealthy donors live. 
Even when the state faced a projected $56 billion deficit over two years in 2023, Rendon said Democrats were “shrugging” at the problem and pointing to the state’s reserves as a solution, which he said reflected a culture of reliance on the rainy day fund.
This year, Newsom has already spoken out against a proposed labor-backed wealth tax ballot measure, consistent with his past opposition to similar proposals. 
The ballot measure, titled “The 2026 Billionaire Tax Act” and filed with the state attorney general’s office in October, seeks to tack a one-time 5% tax on those with a net worth of at least $1 billion and use the money to fund the state’s health care and education programs. The effort is led by the SEIU-UHW, a powerful labor union representing health care workers, and St. John’s Community Health, one of the largest nonprofit health care providers in Los Angeles County.
State. Sen. Roger Niello, a Roseville Republican and vice chair of the Senate Budget Committee, applauded Newsom’s opposition to the proposed tax increase. 
“To have a situation where we have developed an increasing deficit in the face of an economy that is not in recession, and revenues are increasing, it would seem to be silly to solve that by further increasing revenue,” he said. 
While taxing the rich is a popular Democratic talking point, backing a proposal like that could mean alienating the wealthy donors Newsom will likely rely on for his presidential run. 
There would also be no political gain for Newsom in his last year to stabilize the state’s progressive tax structure, which heavily relies on high-income earners, despite him promising to do so when he took office.

,California,2026-01-06 13:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,California tax revenue getting a boost from AI boom — but for how long?,Levi Sumagaysay,,,,,https://calmatters.org/economy/technology/2026/01/california-tech-tax-revenue/,"As talk of a possible AI bubble grows, so does uncertainty around an important source of California tax money.","In summary
As talk of a possible AI bubble grows, so does uncertainty around an important source of California tax money.


As California becomes more dependent on tax revenue from the tech industry, its stake in the health of the artificial intelligence industry has grown.
The state is seeing financial benefits from the AI boom, a new analysis by the Legislative Analyst’s Office shows. But the boom raises questions: Will it continue to be accompanied by a decline in tech and other jobs? Is it a bubble? 
Tax revenue from stock-option withholding paid by some of the state’s biggest tech companies made up about 10% of all income tax withholding in 2025, estimated Chas Alamo, the principal fiscal and policy analyst with the LAO. Alamo looked at tech companies’ public financial filings and other data through the second quarter of 2025. That figure would be about the same as 2024, and is up from more than 6% just three years ago, when he first did the analysis.
The state’s biggest source of revenue is personal income tax. It’s common for tech companies to pay employees in stock options in addition to their base wages. Stock options that have vested and are fully owned by employees are treated like ordinary income for tax purposes, so companies pay withholding taxes on some of that income to the state and U.S. governments. 
Shining a spotlight on where the state’s tax revenue comes from is especially timely, when it needs all the revenue it can get. California is expected to have a nearly $18 billion budget deficit this year, with the state expecting to have to fill funding gaps because of cuts by the Trump administration. But the state’s growing reliance on AI-driven revenue is risky for two reasons: fears that the technology is overhyped, and because AI’s rise threatens livelihoods.
Alamo based his analysis on the performance of the state’s five most valuable tech companies by market value: Apple, Google, Nvidia, Broadcom and Meta. Shares of Nvidia, Broadcom and Google did especially well in 2025: They rose 25%, 46% and 59% for the year, respectively. Alamo also included Intel, Cisco, AMD, Intuit, Paypal, Applied Materials and Qualcomm in his analysis because they paid substantial amounts of withholding on their employees’ stock options.
“We’re seeing a real boost to income-tax receipts because of this — for a relatively small number of employees,” Alamo told CalMatters. “If the AI market were to deteriorate, we could see these withholdings decline.” 
In other words, if the AI bubble pops, California could see a steep drop in tax revenue. That’s because there has been little job growth and wages are not rising, Alamo said, adding that the analyst’s office has been raising its concern over “the stagnant nature of the state’s labor market and broader economy” for the past couple of years. In September, the most recent data available, California’s unemployment rate rose to 5.6%, the highest among U.S. states.

‘AI is not a job-gainer’
Despite the AI boom, the number of tech jobs in the Bay Area actually decreased from September 2024 to August 2025, according to the latest analysis by the Bay Area Council Economic Institute, a think tank supported by the Bay Area Council, a business coalition. Jobs in the information industry were down 1.3% over that period, while jobs in professional and business services fell 1.5%. Some tech companies, such as San Francisco-based Salesforce, mentioned AI as a factor when they disclosed layoffs of thousands of employees. 
“Right now, on net, AI is not a job-gainer,” said Jeff Bellisario, executive director of the think tank. “The bigger question for us is, you put aside (tech companies’) valuation and think about the number of people employed in these companies.” 
Another analysis of employment data by the California Business Roundtable’s information arm, the California Center for Jobs and the Economy, shows a loss of more than 130,000 jobs in high tech, including manufacturing jobs, through the first quarter of last year. 
“Tech booms in the past have led to an employment boom,” Bellisario said. “This doesn’t feel like that.”
There’s no consensus about whether this tech boom is set to go bust anytime soon. Some of the biggest AI optimists include Jensen Huang, chief executive of chipmaker Nvidia, who told investors in November: “There has been a lot of talk about an AI bubble. From our vantage point, we see something very different.” 
Another optimist is Dan Ives, longtime tech analyst and managing director at Wedbush Securities. 
“This is not a bubble,” he told CalMatters. “This is Year 3 of an 8- to 10-year buildout of the AI revolution.” Ives said AI could be huge for U.S. innovation, and that this moment in time reminds him “much more of a 1996 moment than a 1999 or 2000 moment.” 
Bubble back-and-forth
In the mid-1990s, widespread adoption of personal computers and the advent of the graphical web browser paved the way for the dot-com boom and gave rise to companies such as Google, Netflix and PayPal. But by 2000 or shortly afterward, after the founders of those companies made their fortunes, many other internet companies had gone out of business — some in spectacular flameouts, such as Webvan or Pets.com.

Today, there are signs that there are too many startups in certain subsectors, according to analysts at PitchBook, which tracks public and private capital markets. Among the ones they mentioned in their 2026 outlook: AI scribes in health care, which automatically generate medical notes; aerial defense drones; content development in gaming; personal assistant bots; and more. The analysts warned investors that startups would really need to differentiate themselves to bring value.
Researchers for Allianz Trade, the global insurance company, wrote in a November brief: “The financial market frenzy over AI shows classic signs of an asset bubble: widespread consensus, unproven valuations and returns at times detached from earnings.” The researchers also said they were watching a lot of corporate spending on AI as concerns grow around tightening energy constraints. AI is driving demand for data centers, which are straining the electric grid.
Discussion about a bubble aside, some tech-friendly experts point out that California’s reliance on AI means the state should help the sector succeed, such as by not overregulating it. 
“What’s important to remember is that California’s social safety net depends on a healthy tech industry, “ said Kaitlyn Harger, an economist for Chamber of Progress, a think tank funded by the tech industry. The financial cushion tech provides helps the state fund public-sector jobs, health services, education, social services and more, Harger said. 
California leads all states in trying to regulate AI, and is expected to fight against the president’s recent executive order to develop federal laws around AI that would supersede state laws.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/122025-Data-Center-Vernon-GETTY-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C709&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-06 08:59:42.018184

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)The moment Gov. Tim Walz was cooked was little remarked upon at the time, but in retrospect illustrates how he and his administration were sleeping through an enveloping crisis. 
At the late 2024 budget forecast, he said disability and autism services were driving state government spending beyond expectations. When he was asked about potential fraud in the autism program — about which we’d reported an FBI investigation six months prior — he seemed unfamiliar. I traded texts with an incredulous reporter who was there and wound up publishing a column called, “Minnesota: an easy mark.” 
More recently, Walz faced the full force of the right-wing propaganda machine in the past two months. It was a frightening sight to behold, and a healthier democracy would never be host to such a parasitical malignancy. 
Although restoring American democratic habits of mind to eviscerate that propaganda machine should be on our lengthy, long-term to-do list, the lesson here for me is that the most underrated tool in the political toolbox is … governing. 
Deadly dull, I know, but the word governor even has the word “govern” in it: competently administering programs to help people who need it; ensuring Minnesota’s children are learning literacy and numeracy; and managing the state’s vast infrastructure assets. That’s the job. 
Former St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter, another one-time rising star in Minnesota politics, recently faced the same sort of governing reckoning as Walz, when Mayor Kaohly Her pulled off an upset November victory promising to make stuff work again. May Democratic elected officials everywhere take notice. 
We live in perilous times, no question, but Minnesotans are right to expect a minimum level of competency in these matters of public administration. It’s especially important for the party of government, i.e., the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, to pay attention to details, like whether a 3,000% increase in spending on the autism program is reasonable, especially when some of the providers had ties to Feeding Our Future. 
Tim Walz is at heart a decent man, and he doesn’t deserve what’s been thrown at him in recent weeks — especially a despicable allegation leveled by the president of the United States and the odious propagandist Nick Shirley that Walz was involved in the assassination of former House Speaker Melissa Hortman. 
He made some mistakes, but he’s not evil, unlike some of the loudest and most influential voices in American politics today, whose greed and lust for power are boundless. 
Walz’s first term was marked by almost constant crisis, none of it his doing. He was a mostly steady hand, even as Republicans came to despise him during the pandemic and the aftermath of the police murder of George Floyd.
His second term comprised major legislative accomplishments — for which the credit mostly belongs to Hortman and the late Sen. Kari Dziedzic — as well as his (again, in retrospect) disastrous candidacy for vice president. All the while, thieves were stealing the people’s money with gusto.
Walz has served the community of Mankato, the people of Minnesota and his country. 
And now he has saved us from what would have been a deeply divisive campaign, and which would have put the state of Minnesota under federal siege. 
Unlike former President Joe Biden, who doomed his party and the country with his insistence on running for a second term, Walz is stepping aside before any more damage is done to his state and the DFL. He says he’ll focus all his energies on cleaning up the mess. 
He deserves our thanks for that service and for making this decision.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/MG_9328-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-06 08:59:42.018184

(Illustration by Alex Cochran for Utah News Dispatch, image courtesy of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement)After President Donald Trump returned to the White House last January and launched an aggressive immigration crackdown, at least 3,040 immigration arrests have happened in Utah — more than double the number of arrests under former President Joe Biden’s administration in 2024.
Of those, slightly more than half of the arrests in Utah last year — 55% or 1,685 — have been of people with criminal convictions. But that’s not so for the other 45%.
About 27.4% or 832 arrests were of people with what immigration officials categorized as having pending criminal charges at the time of their arrests. And the other 522 arrests — making up about 17% — were detained solely for alleged immigration violations. That’s more than six times the number of immigration arrests in Utah of people with no criminal record (82, or a 7% share) under former President Joe Biden’s administration in 2024.
That’s according to data obtained through public information requests and litigation by the  Deportation Data Project, a group of academics and lawyers that collects and shares anonymized U.S. government immigration enforcement datasets, and compiled into a dashboard developed by Relevant Research, a research group focused on immigration data. 
The dashboard includes Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrest data dating back to September 2023 and through Oct. 15, 2025. Monthly arrest data in that time frame show a clear uptick in ICE arrests starting last January and continuing through 2025, according to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement data obtained and processed by the Deportation Data Project, and analyzed by Utah News Dispatch. 



Because about 16% of the government data provided to the Deportation Data Project is missing state information, the number of immigration arrests in Utah may be higher.
Through 2025, the share of arrests of people in Utah solely for alleged immigration violations and no pending or criminal charges have also grown compared to 2024.
From September 2023 to December 2024, 1,457 immigration arrests took place in Utah, according to the dashboard. Of those, 71% (1,034) were of people with criminal convictions. About 22% (322) were of people with pending criminal charges, and less than 7% (101) were solely for alleged immigration violations. 
The data paints a statistical picture of ICE operations in Utah. Under Trump, ICE arrests of all types are up — and a majority include those with criminal convictions. But even if it’s a smaller percentage, there’s a growing share of people arrested by ICE with no criminal record. 
Notably, Utah’s share of immigrant arrests solely for alleged immigration violations is smaller than the national share of those arrested with no criminal record, which makes up roughly one-third of immigrants arrested nationwide. 
While high-profile ICE operations in major cities like Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and Massachusetts have resulted in more than half of those arrested with no criminal record, according to The New York Times, operations in the red state of Utah haven’t been as aggressive.

However, the numbers only go so far to tell the story of what’s been happening in the Beehive State, where ICE operations have largely flown under the radar — except for certain arrests that have sparked outcry. 
Among them was an arrest of a woman at the Salt Lake City International Airport — which went viral after a video posted on social media showed four plain-clothes ICE officers take her away as she screamed for help. 
In the state’s Democratic stronghold of Salt Lake City, leaders condemned the arrest. Mayor Erin Mendenhall said she was left “aching from the fear and pain these types of operations keep striking in my heart and the hearts of so many of us.” 
‘Worst of the worst’
While ICE officials under Trump have said they’re targeting the “worst of the worst,” critics including immigrant advocates and attorneys in Utah have criticized the Trump administration’s approach. 
They say the federal government’s tactics have been “broad” and “haphazard,” sweeping up too many otherwise law-abiding people while the nation’s immigration system remains broken and difficult to navigate.
Utah News Dispatch sent a request for comment to the Department of Homeland Security pointing to the data that shows arrests of all types are up in Utah, but also asking about the growing percentage of people in Utah who are being arrested solely on alleged immigrant violations. The department issued a statement from Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs, that has been provided to other news outlets maintaining the Trump administration is focused on “the worst of the worst.” 
“This story only reveals how the media manipulates data to peddle a false narrative that DHS is not targeting the worst of the worst,” McLaughlin said. “Nationwide our law enforcement is targeting the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens — including murderers, rapists, gang members, pedophiles, and terrorists.”
She added: “70% of illegal aliens ICE arrested across the country have criminal convictions or pending criminal charges just in the U.S. This statistic doesn’t account for those wanted for violent crimes in their home country or another country, INTERPOL notices, human rights abusers, gang members, terrorists, etc. The list goes on.”

The Department of Homeland Security statement also pointed to a list of press releases it said were examples of “non-criminals” arrested by ICE that are wanted for crimes allegedly committed outside of the U.S. 
The Department of Homeland Security has also created a “worst of the worst” dashboard to highlight arrests. As of Monday, about 250 arrests were listed on that dashboard from Utah. The dashboard lists their name, city where they were arrested, and what they were convicted of, according to the Department of Homeland Security. 
The convictions listed next to some of the highlighted arrests on the “worst of the worst” dashboard range from homicide, assault, sexual assault and drug trafficking. Some convictions listed, however, include nonviolent crimes such as fraud for making a false statement, forgery, and illegal re-entry. 
The dashboard doesn’t list dates for the arrests, but the 250 highlighted in Utah make up about 8% of the 3,040 immigration arrests that occurred in the state in 2025, according to Deportation Data Project data. It’s also less than 15% of the total number of people arrested (1,685) with criminal convictions in all of 2025 in Utah. 



Is being present in the U.S. in violation of immigration laws a crime? 
On its own, no, it’s not a crime, but a civil infraction. The act of entering the U.S. without being inspected and admitted is a federal crime (a misdemeanor or a felony, depending on the circumstances). But many undocumented immigrants do not enter the U.S. illegally. “They enter legally but overstay, work without authorization, drop out of school or violate the conditions of their visas in some other way,” according to the American Civil Liberties Union. 



While more than 80% of ICE arrests in 2025 in Utah have been of people with pending criminal charges or convictions, the increased enforcement on others without criminal records has raised alarms for immigration advocates and legal defenders.
With eyes on what’s happening both nationally and in their home state, they say the uptick of ICE operations — and particularly arrests of people with no criminal backgrounds — have left many immigrants, their families and their communities living in fear and uncertainty. 
They say the tactics — especially arrests of those seeking legal status at Salt Lake City’s U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office — have intimidated many to retreat further into the shadows. 
A human and economic cost
The cost of more aggressive immigration enforcement is both human and economic, said Bob Babcock, a longtime construction attorney specializing in an industry that is highly dependent on immigrant labor. 
“I feel like we are abusing this community,” Babcock told Utah News Dispatch in a recent interview. “And I am shocked that so many of our citizens don’t understand and they think it’s a simple solution — ‘Oh just go back and come legally,’ you know? That’s a bunch of crock.” 
Babcock said he wishes more people understood there’s not a simple “line” that undocumented immigrants wait in to obtain legal status. 
“There is no line for carpenters, concrete workers, drywall workers,” he said. “No such line exists.” Meanwhile, he said the industries are short employees because the natural birth rate in the U.S. has long been declining and fewer people are willing to work in labor-intensive fields. 










They’re not criminals. They’re not the ‘worst of the worst.' That’s not who they’re getting. They’re getting anybody and everybody they can. 


– Bob Babcock, construction attorney


In a recent op-ed for the Deseret News, Babcock posed a question for leaders and residents of a state that has long been known to be welcoming and solutions-focused when it comes to immigrants and refugees: Are Utahns OK with what ICE is doing in their state? 
“Everybody’s very fearful,” Babcock told Utah News Dispatch, adding that his clients in the construction industry have seen workers occasionally being “picked up and detained.” 
“They’re losing guys. They’re not criminals. They’re not the ‘worst of the worst,’” he said. “That’s not who they’re getting. They’re getting anybody and everybody they can.” 
Babcock said he’s not aware of any major raids or large-scale arrests on job sites in Utah, but the arrests that have happened instill fear. That fear has been leading some to not show up to work at times.

“And the expectation is it’s going to get much worse,” he said. 
While Republicans and Democrats alike have for years agreed the nation’s immigration system is broken, nothing has been done about it, Babcock said. And the resulting reality is it’s common for undocumented people to work in construction and agriculture, and without them the industries would suffer, he said. 
The current approach, he said, is doing more harm than good. He called on Utah’s state and federal leaders to be courageous and stand up to the Trump administration and say what’s happening isn’t only inhumane — it’s damaging the workforce and economy. 
“Everyone should be standing up and saying, ‘We need a solution,’” he said. “Crushing the workforce day by day is not the solution.” 
What has Gov. Cox said about ICE enforcement in Utah?
In late 2024, Gov. Spencer Cox announced a “targeted” state effort to support the Trump administration’s immigration policies with an emphasis on immigrants “who have committed crimes and pose a threat to public safety.” 
“When it comes to immigration policy, the safety of Utah residents is my top priority,” Cox said in a statement at the time. “Utah will continue to welcome refugees and immigrants who enter the country lawfully, and we will continue pushing for reforms to the asylum process and for more visas to support our workforce needs. We have zero tolerance, however, for those who demonstrate a threat to public safety while in the country illegally.” 










My position is always that laws are supposed to be followed, that we are, I believe, the most welcoming state in the country when it comes to people who are seeking a new life and who are coming here. But you also have to do it the right way, and that’s really important.


– Utah Gov. Spencer Cox


When asked during his most recent news conference broadcast by PBS Utah on Nov. 25 about ICE operations in Utah becoming more frequent and aggressive, Cox said “my position hasn’t changed at all.” 
“My position is always that laws are supposed to be followed, that we are, I believe, the most welcoming state in the country when it comes to people who are seeking a new life and who are coming here,” he said. “But you also have to do it the right way, and that’s really important.” 
Cox added that his administration has been “very supportive of operations to enforce the law and will continue to be.” 
Cox’s office did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this story.  
‘Haphazard and broad enforcement’
Like the arrest data shows, civil rights advocates have noticed an uptick of ICE enforcement in Utah — and “we have seen an increase in detentions and arrests of folks that don’t have a criminal record or only have a record of more minor criminal offenses,” said Ellie Menlove, legislative and policy council for the ACLU of Utah. 
“We’re seeing more haphazard and broad enforcement without regard to a person’s criminal status,” Menlove said, “which is extremely worrying to us from a civil rights perspective, and it wasn’t what ICE said that they were going to do in the state.” 
The ACLU of Utah is part of the Utah Immigrant Advocacy Coalition — a group of organizations “committed to ensuring Utah remains a welcoming and supportive community for all immigrants, regardless of their status,” according to the coalition’s website. 
The ACLU of Utah has been keeping an up-to-date tracker of the various types of 287(g) agreements that state and local governments have adopted to give local police the power to enforce federal immigration law. In effect, the agreements can turn local officers into ICE agents, “fueling deportations, racial profiling, and fear in immigrant communities,” the ACLU of Utah says on the site. 



The following Utah government entities have adopted 287(g) agreements, according to the ACLU of Utah

Utah Department of Corrections — Warrant Service Officer 
Riverton Police Department — Task Force Model
Cache County — Warrant Service Officer 
Weber County — Task Force Model
Tooele County — Task Force Model
Utah County — Task Force Model and Warrant Service Officer
Wasatch County — Warrant Service Officer
Sanpete County — Warrant Service Officer
Sevier County — Jail Enforcement Model and Warrant Service Officer
Beaver County — Warrant Service Officer
San Juan County — Jail Enforcement Model
Kane County — Warrant Service Officer
Washington County — Task Force Model and Jail Enforcement Model

 



“This just creates a lot of fear in immigrant communities, and it’s overall very harmful to public safety in general when people are under the impression that a law enforcement agency is working with ICE,” said Molly Karasick, a legal fellow with the ACLU of Utah.
The different types of 287(g) agreements grant varying levels of power to local agencies to enforce immigration law — but they all have the same effect of giving the impression that those agencies are partnering with ICE, and that has a chilling effect on communities, Karasick said. 
“When you see that your local agencies partner with ICE, that gives a broad impression that they’re working with ICE and it undermines the community towards law enforcement in general,” she said. “And then, in effect, we have people who are scared to contact their local police or sheriff’s department because they’re under the impression that they’re working with immigration. And when people aren’t reporting crimes, that’s more dangerous for every single person.” 
There are three different types of 287(g) agreements — the Jail Enforcement Model, the Warrant Service Officer and the Task Force Model. 
The Task Force Model grants the most power and is the most concerning to civil rights advocates. Described by ICE as a “force multiplier,” it allows state and local law enforcement agencies to make immigration arrests during regular police enforcement.
The Jail Enforcement Model delegates some immigration authority to state and local law enforcement agencies to identify immigrants in state and local custody and place them into immigration proceedings. “Corrections officers in local jails, under the supervision of ICE, are deputized by the federal government to interrogate people in their custody about their immigration status and funnel people into the deportation pipeline,” the ACLU of Utah says. 
The Warrant Service Officer model grants limited powers, allowing ICE to train, certify and authorize state and local law enforcement officers to serve administrative immigration warrants on people who are in custody in their jails.

‘One of the great horrors of our generation’
Immigration Attorney Nicholle Pitt White was among the attorneys last month warning immigrants to get legal consultation before going to appointments at the U.S. Citizen and Immigration Services field office in Salt Lake City due to reports that arrests of immigrants in the process of applying for legal status had started taking place there. 
Though data shows more than half of ICE arrests in Utah have been of people with criminal convictions, Pitt White said the growing number of people arrested solely based on alleged immigration violations is unjust. 
‘Stuck between a rock and a hard place’: Lawyers warn of arrests at Salt Lake immigration office  

Pitt White said she takes the following legal principle of criminal justice to heart: “It’s better that 10 guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer.” 
“And I think that’s true for immigrants, too,” she said. “The vast majority of these people, even the ones with criminal history, their crimes are generally pretty minor.”
To Pitt White, what’s happening in the U.S. is “one of the great horrors of our generation.” 
She has multiple stories of aggressive ICE arrests from her own law firm. 
From a case that happened in Utah, Pitt White described seeing dashcam footage “of a dad that had his toddler in the car with him, that had a removal order, meaning a deportation order, but there was reason to believe that should be re-opened.” 
“ICE stopped him. They broke the window where his toddler was. They refused to identify themselves,” she said. “He didn’t know if they were actually ICE or just criminals trying to harm him and his kid, and he took off.” 
Thanks to the dashcam footage, Pitt White said she and her legal team were able to prove “he didn’t actually harm any of the ICE officers” in the face of federal officials accusing him of trying to cause intentional harm to a federal officer. “He was able to provide video evidence to prove that was a big fat lie.” 
“But that’s one of the most egregious things I’ve seen,” she said.

Pitt White said she’s also heard of “several examples” in areas like West Valley City and Magna where “ICE has just kind of sat outside of apartment complexes that are heavily Latino, and they’ll just stop everyone on their way out and ask for papers. And they’ve, like, filled up vans of people and taken them away.” 
Compared to other states, Utah’s ICE operations aren’t as large-scale or high profile — but Pitt White noted Utah does have a fairly large immigrant population in parts of the state, and arrests are happening here, even though many go unreported in the media. 
“I think we had a false sense of security here because Utah is so red,” she said. “But the more we know and the more we’ve seen, it’s not any different here.” 
Like Babcock, Pitt White said she wishes Utah’s political leaders would stand up to what’s happening. Most immigrants are here seeking safety, not to cause trouble. 
“I’ve met so many people that have come here not just because they wanted to work and make a better life for themselves and their family, but because in their home country they were raped by multiple family members and the police refused to help them,” she said. “And the only place they felt they could be safe was here. Because here we follow the laws and we have police that will protect you and we care about your rights.” 
“It’s horrifying,” she said, “that that no longer seems to be the case.” 
Pitt White also urged people who might support the Trump administration’s actions to take a step back and recognize there are good people being swept up by ICE — it could be their neighbor, a friend, someone who cleans their house, or who works on a local farm or at a nearby mechanic shop.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)The commotion at the security checkpoint was unusual for a weekday in October. Travelers heading to their gates stopped in their tracks as a woman cried out for help, yelling “No!” and “I have my papers” at Salt Lake City International Airport.  
Video quickly spread of four immigration officers pulling her to the ground and taking her away as she tried to break free, jumping in her stocking feet. Since then, immigration attorneys say the emotional and widely viewed arrest has marked a turning point in Utah.
The viral airport arrest has ratcheted up fear for Utahns without permanent legal status. And it changed the advice Utah attorneys give many of their clients about booking any flights as the Trump administration continues to intensify immigration enforcement.

Two months later, would-be travelers continue to ask South Jordan attorney Carlos Trujillo if it’s unwise to buy plane tickets out of state to visit family or take their children to a Disney theme park. He now advises those with pending applications for green cards or asylum to stay home. 
“The best answer you can tell them is, honestly, if it’s not a necessary flight, if somebody’s not dying, it’s not recommended,” Trujillo said. “It’s not, because that’s where they’re grabbing people.” 
He also tells naturalized citizens and permanent residents to bring their documents with them, saying several clients have been stopped for further questioning. 
“They’ve been taken to secondary screening for the first time in all their life here, and that seems to be picking up more and more,” Trujillo said.  
Few interactions involving immigration enforcers in Utah have been as visible as the airport arrest. Before this year, authorities didn’t typically arrest flyers in the busy, public setting unless they were wanted in criminal cases. The woman they detained on Oct. 29, originally from El Salvador, had a prior deportation order but no criminal record.

The dramatic video reinforced how immigration operations are increasingly being carried out in public, at businesses, near schools and in public places across the country. Trujillo said he anticipates immigration enforcement will intensify in 2026 after a cash infusion from Republicans’ “big, beautiful bill.”
Congress set aside $30 billion for ICE hiring, transportation and other costs as part of the legislation. ICE did not respond to a request for comment from Utah News Dispatch about the arrest at the airport or the new funding’s impact in the state. 
Kimberly Tobar, a therapist with Jacky’s Recovery Support Services who works with members of Utah’s Latino communities, noted the significant change to daily life for many immigrants who  haven’t left their homes in months and aren’t going to work or school because they’re worried about being stopped by authorities. 
“Even people who have documentation here feel that fear, because they feel that they’re going to get racially profiled and just be accused of not having documentation,” Tobar said.

She said that worry has left many in a state of isolation and constant anxiety “that they feel very powerless over, because they’re like, ‘What can I do?’”
Tobar said teenagers her organization works with report they’re worried about ICE coming to their school or job and detaining them, or that they’ll come home at the end of the day to find their parents aren’t there anymore. Others have brought up that they aren’t traveling to see loved ones. 
“A lot of the youth have also been the ones that are learning about their rights and teaching their family members,” Tobar said. 
Attorneys representing the woman detained at the airport emphasize that she has a current work permit and no criminal history.
“What it demonstrates is that ICE is actively using everything in its means to try to identify individuals who have outstanding deportation orders,” said one of her attorneys, Andrew Armstrong. 
He said his client applied for asylum in the U.S. years ago with the help of someone she hired to assist with the paperwork. But that person never provided her with correspondence from the government demanding her further participation in the process, Armstrong said.

Her subsequent lack of response triggered the deportation proceeding, Armstrong told Utah News Dispatch. She didn’t receive notice of that case either, and didn’t know it ended in a deportation order until she was carried out of the airport, he said. 
“I don’t want to criticize the ICE agents having to do their job,” Armstrong said. “But they were large men who forcefully removed her from the airport who did not speak Spanish and were not able to explain to her what was going on.”
She is being held in a detention center in Louisiana, Armstrong said, as she waits to hear whether a judge will withdraw the deportation order. Such arrests “create fear so that they inspire certain immigrants to leave on their own because they are so afraid of what might happen to them if they stay here,” Armstrong said. 
His client came on the radar of ICE via a list of passengers that airlines provide the federal government, Armstrong said. The Transportation Security Administration has begun sharing more data with ICE to deport more people, including in her case, The New York Times reported in December, citing internal documents the newspaper obtained. 
TSA and ICE are both under the umbrella of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. 
Ysabel Lonazco, an immigration attorney in West Valley City, agrees the dramatic scene near the baggage claim was a turning point. 
She now counsels those living in Utah without documents to avoid traveling. 
“There’s an Ysabel before the airport — and after the airport,” Lonazco said. “The attorney before the airport event would tell you, ‘OK, you can fly with your passport, you’ll be fine. Keep on with your life.’ But after, it’s like, ‘Don’t go anywhere. Don’t fly out of state.’” 
She also advises clients at risk of deportation to avoid driving to Zion National Park, because the sheriff’s office in neighboring Washington County has a formal partnership with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement known as a 287(g) agreement.
Lonazco said she tries to avoid instilling more fear in clients, but has new advice for those whose travel plans cause her concern:  “just try to find joy within home.”",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/saltlakecityairport_0-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-06 08:12:06.784381

(Annie Knox/Utah News Dispatch)On an early December weekend hundreds of Latinos congregated at a Salt Lake Community College conference center in Sandy. Tables were set in a fair-like style, the smell of a mixture of perfume samples saturated the air, the hot pink and bright yellow of Venezuelan snack packaging and stress balls from an immigration law firm decorated some areas.
A voice with a Maracaibo accent announced an upcoming raffle for a piece of pernil-style pork, a traditional Christmas dish every hour, this year’s initiative at the annual Christmas celebration hosted by Utahzolanos, a social media outlet and community.
The event has been a tradition kept for five years. But this time, amid stronger immigration enforcement tactics deployed by the Trump administration, and increasing immigration arrests in the state, the sentiment and tone around the event changed.

Organizers modeled the party into an event in support of the community, said Patricia Quiñonez, who runs Utahzolanos. However, she said, it still was “a chance to cheer each other on, to give each other strength.”
Fewer people showed up this year, Quiñonez said. Still, about 2,000 came, which is about 1,000 less than what the organization had seen in past years.
“We are happy because we expected fear to prevail over the call, the invitation to attend,” she said.
This year’s Christmas party had Santa Claus hats, toys, crafts and gifts. However, the busiest tables were those of immigration law firms offering free consultations. 
But, other events, like Utahzolanos’ New Year’s party, an often-sold out event where over 1,000 people gather for food and music, was almost canceled as ticket sales languished. The traditional celebration ultimately came together, but with 60% fewer attendees this year.
“We didn’t want to lose the tradition we’ve had for the past five years,” she said. “The families who didn’t come told us they were afraid to attend a predominantly Latino event that might attract the attention of ICE.”
Venezuelans living in the U.S. have felt a particularly heavy impact since the second Trump administration took power. The Temporary Protection Status, a protection from deportation that Trump granted Venezuelans during his first term, has been eliminated, abruptly leaving about 600,000 Venezuelans without work permits, driver’s licenses or permission to remain in the country. In all, more than 1.5 million people lost legal status in 2025.
Quiñonez says many of her group’s followers have said they are self-deporting out of fear of being detained and separated from their families. Others have voluntarily left the country after the detention of the breadwinner.

“It’s not just people who have been here for two, or three years. We are talking about friends who applied for asylum 10, eight, seven years ago,” Quiñonez said in Spanish, adding that many feel worn out by how cases are playing out in immigration courts. 
In October, the Department of Homeland Security reported that 1.6 million people had voluntarily self-deported since President Donald Trump reclaimed the White House.
“Fear is overcoming faith or the choice of moving forward with immigration cases,” she said.
Since Venezuela and the U.S. don’t share a diplomatic relation, first-generation Americans born in Venezuelan families aren’t able to receive a visa to Venezuela to join their parents if they are deported. 
Some of those who decide to stay have begun limiting their routines — Latin restaurants have become off-limits for many fearing an ICE raid. And some churches have low attendance on Sundays, as well, she said. Immigration attorneys have started advising their clients to restrict travel, a new recommendation stemming from a high-profile ICE arrest at the Salt Lake City airport.
However, in the last three months, Quiñonez has also seen Latino entrepreneurs opening businesses, including restaurants, barber shops, insurance companies and car dealerships, she said. 
But, amid these sparks of hope in the Latin community, immigrants remain uncertain about whether immigration enforcement will turn more aggressive in Utah, especially now with reports naming Utah the home of an upcoming 10,000-bed ICE detention facility. 
“It makes you wonder, if that 10,000-people capacity means that they’ll be stricter. Will they search for more people to be at that detention center?” Quiñonez said.
‘The fear isn’t exclusively quarantined just to Latinos’
Like other owners of establishments with international offerings, for a naturalized American business owner with warehouse operations in Salt Lake City, watching how ICE raids developed in 2025 makes him feel “completely uncomfortable.”
While the business owner is an American citizen, with tensions lingering in the immigrant community, he asked not to be identified for fear of becoming an ICE target.
“Their program is to remove criminals from our communities, but our community is suffering because they don’t pause and take the time to respect human rights,” he said, adding that officers have often detained people without a criminal record. “It’s terrible for our communities, and it’s terrible for any industries where immigrants and minorities are working.”
Anecdotally, there hasn’t been a massive mobilization across Hispanic businesses in the state, said Victoria Petro, a Salt Lake City Council member and executive director of the Utah Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. But, this federal administration’s tactics instill fear among communities in the state.
“People are more susceptible to false alarms and anecdotes, right?” Petro said. “So it just creates kind of a jumpiness and a difficulty for our people to understand, where is truth? Where is credible information?”



Let us know what you think...


 


The immigration enforcement operations have also brought a chilling effect to Utah Hispanic establishments — mostly from anxiety about spending money in Latin businesses in fear of being detained, even with a legal immigration status, she said.
“If I’m a consumer, and I go to a market that caters predominantly to the Hispanic community, ‘la migra’ might show up there a lot more readily than they’re going to show up at Smith’s,” Petro said. “So we’re seeing a transfer of buying power to a more dominant paradigm, and it’s more difficult to aggregate audiences and consumers in places where they worry they might be profiled.”
With more Latin consumers saving up for emergencies and avoiding Hispanic establishments, the conversation around immigration enforcement in the chamber has been ongoing, Petro said, with many businesses aiming to determine how to maintain consumer bases with this threat. 
“I was just with a business the other day that showed me their year-over-year, their expenses have skyrocketed and their revenues have gone down,” she said.
And, not only Hispanic-owned businesses have suffered the impact of the federal operations. 
“We’ve seen an influx from construction companies who are looking into membership with us to stand with us, and to try to stay up to date as to what they’re facing in labor supply,” Petro said, “So the fear isn’t exclusively quarantined just to Latinos. It’s being shared now by the dominant paradigm as well.”
The Salt Lake City business owner still hopes his staff doesn’t feel targeted just for the fact his business has Mexican origins. He has done some planning, ensuring that everyone knows their rights in the case an immigration officer comes knocking on his business’ door. But, he’s not making a big fuss out of it, especially since not every employee that works for him “happens to be Mexican,” he said.
His job, he said, is to run his business, “not to create chaos.”",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4962-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-06 08:12:06.784381

“The premise behind this is to make sure that every child in the state of Alabama, especially with the emphasis on the Literacy Act and other programs that have recently been implemented, but to make sure that every child in the state of Alabama has access to books and to help them develop a love for learning,” Kitchens said in a recent interview.

Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library is a book gifting program that mails free “high quality books” to children regardless of their families income. The initiative was started in 1995 by Parton to distribute books to families in Sevier County, TN. In 2000, Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library became a nationwide program.
Gov. Kay Ivey launched a statewide expansion of Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library in 2023. The prefiled bill makes no changes to the program but codifies an executive order Ivey signed in 2023 to establish the statewide expansion of the Imagination Library.
State funds will make up half of the funding for the program, while local partner programs will make up the other half.
Collins filed a similar bill in the House during the 2025 legislative session. It did not pass through the Senate due to time constraints. 
Under the legislation, the Alabama Imagination Library will be managed by the Alabama Department of Early Childhood Education (ADECE). The department will also be required to work with a nonprofit agency to operate the program and create rules as needed.
Private donations are also allowed to be contributed to help fund the program.
“When you pass legislation, more people are going to hear about it, so more families with young children will be able to sign up. They’ll be more informed about it, and then local groups or individuals that are looking for something to support, they can see the benefits of this, and so they can choose to support it,” Collins said in a recent interview.
The books provided for the children must be considered age appropriate.  
“Age appropriate when they’re very young, would be those big, almost cardboard pages, so that their little fingers can turn them by themselves,” Collins said “And they may have more touch, and there’ll be less as they get a little bit older. They’ll still be simple books, but there’ll be some that they can start recognizing some of the words and some of the things that go with the pictures.”
On Dec. 1, Ivey said in a statement that 2 million books have been distributed by Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library to children in all 67 counties in the state. The statement also said over 106,000 children are enrolled in the program.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Wes-Kitchens-May-8-2024-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-06 08:12:06.784381

Gavin Newsom's State of the State address may hint at how he'll balance his last year as governor with his presidential campaign image.,"Political California cranked up for the New Year Monday.
The Legislature reconvened after a 114-day recess, Gov. Gavin Newsom renewed his nascent campaign for president and the dozen or so men and women who covet his job continued to seek ways to reach a so-far-uninterested electorate.
Newsom’s interview Monday on MS NOW, the cable channel beloved by Democratic politicians and activist voters, implied anew that his final year as governor will be dominated by his all-but-certain bid for the White House in 2028. He spent much it criticizing President Donald Trump for refusing aid to Los Angeles fire victims and cracking down on undocumented immigrants.
Newsom’s preoccupation will color whatever he and the Legislature do about a deficit-ridden state budget and a half-dozen or so other stubborn issues that have emerged or become more acute since Newsom took office seven years ago.
In past years Newsom has been lackadaisical about delivering the annual State of the State message to the Legislature that the state constitution requires. But he’ll perform the chore later this week, then unveil his response to the projections of semi-permanent, multi-billion-dollar deficits.
Gabe Petek, the Legislature’s budget analyst, sees an immediate $18 billion gap between income and outgo that could mushroom to $35 billion if not closed. He’s warned that Newsom and legislators can’t count on a sluggish economy to solve their problem.
They have used a variety of gimmicks, including raids on emergency reserves, off-the-books loans and deceptive accounting gambits to stave off the day of fiscal reckoning, but the shortfall, born of overspending revenues, has continued.
“If our estimates hold, the Legislature will face a fourth consecutive year of budget problems — all during a period of overall revenue growth,” Petek said in a November analysis. “As it stands — with larger forecasted deficits and many fewer tools available to address them — California’s budget is undeniably less prepared for downturns.”
The Legislature’s leaders, pressed by a powerful progressive contingent, don’t want to reduce the health care and income support services they so willingly enacted after Newsom declared, erroneously, that the state had a $97.5 billion surplus three years ago.
Progressives and their allies in public employee unions and other left-of-center groups want to close the budget gap with new taxes and are sponsoring two ballot measures, one to extend a surtax on the highest-income taxpayers that’s due to expire and a second to impose a new wealth tax on the state’s billionaires.
Newsom has steadfastly rejected tax increases to deal with the deficit, unwilling, obviously, to become a pro-tax presidential candidate. But neither has he offered, so far, anything other than gimmicks to solve the problem his wildly off-base 2022 surplus declaration created.
The state’s stubborn budget deficit is just one of the issues that continue to defy resolution as Newsom’s final year begins. Other issues include high levels of homelessness and poverty, a housing shortage that’s just as acute as when he took office in 2019, an insurance crisis born of chronic wildfires, a woebegone bullet train project, soaring costs of living, persistent water supply uncertainties and a looming shortage of gasoline as refineries close due to hostile state regulation.
On top of everything, California’s $4 trillion economy is more or less stuck in neutral, with the nation’s highest unemployment rate, no net job growth since the COVID-19 pandemic and severe employment cutbacks in signature sectors, such as film and TV production technology.
The stark existence of such issues during Newsom’s final year as governor is not only a potential drag on his presidential campaign, but it colors the cast-of-thousands campaigns to elect a successor.
Will the would-be Democratic governors be willing to point out Newsom’s leftover issues — especially the budget deficit — and tell voters how they would approach the challenge? Or would they merely joust over who can be the loudest?",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/010526-Newsom-BB-Getty-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-06 08:12:06.784381

Dina Titus. (Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)Nevada’s sole Republican congressman, Rep. Mark Amodei, had as of Monday evening yet to comment on the military capture of former Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro or President Donald Trump’s assertion the country and its oil production industry are under U.S. control.  
Maduro and his wife, captured Saturday in Caracas by an elite U.S. military squad, entered pleas of not guilty Monday in New York to charges of trafficking cocaine. 
Amodei’s office did not respond to a request for comment Monday. His silence comes as Nevada’s Democratic congressional delegates are calling out Trump for deploying the military for a criminal matter and for engaging in regime change and nation-building, policies Trump has previously decried. 
“Our current strategy of nation-building and regime change is a proven, absolute failure,” Trump said while campaigning in 2016. 
Maduro “was a brutal dictator who deserves no sympathy,” Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto said on social media. “But the Trump Administration using American service members to overthrow a foreign leader it has criminally indicted under U.S. law sets a dangerous precedent.”
Trump, she said, “made a dangerous decision to bypass Congress with his actions in Venezuela, and so far he has offered no real details on plans for the future other than a vague assertion that the ‘United States will be running the country.’” 
The prosecution of Maduro, Cortez Masto added, “contradicts” Trump’s pardon of former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez, who was found guilty by a federal jury of conspiring to traffic cocaine and sentenced to 40 years in prison. He was released last month as a result of Trump’s pardon. 
On Monday, Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez was sworn in as interim president in Maduro’s absence. But in an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper, Stephen Miller, a White House deputy chief of staff, laid out a scenario that more closely resembles a military takeover than the criminal apprehension of two individuals.
“We live in a world in which you can talk all you want about international niceties and everything else. But we live in a world, in the real world, Jake, that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power,” Miller said. “By definition, we are in charge, because we have the United States military stationed outside the country. We set the terms and conditions. We have a complete embargo on all of their oil and their ability to do commerce. So for them to do commerce, they need our permission. For them to be able to run an economy, they need our permission.” 
Sen. Jacky Rosen, a Democrat and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, called Maduro an “illegitimate and brutal dictator” but noted only Congress has the power to declare war. “This illegal regime change operation won’t make our country safer and risks destabilizing the region, dragging us into additional military conflicts, and increasing the amount of immigrants seeking refuge at our border.”
Trump’s administration needs to “explain why it lied when it claimed in its briefings that regime change wasn’t the U.S. goal in Venezuela,” Rosen said, and urged Congress to pass Senator Tim Kaine’s (D-Virginia) War Powers Resolution “to prohibit Donald Trump from carrying out additional strikes without our input.”
In a statement issued Saturday, Rep. Dina Titus, a former Political Science professor at UNLV, detailed more than half a century of U.S. regime change efforts in Latin America. 
“In each case, our long-term interests were not advanced, regional relationships were damaged, and the Hemisphere saw more turmoil and violence, not less, “ she said. “Instead of learning from history, President Trump has perpetuated a failed foreign policy.”
The Trump administration’s action, Titus said, “is clearly based largely on the desire to take over Venezuela’s oil.”
The U.S. invasion of a sovereign nation, she added, “opens the door for Xi Jinping to do the same in Taiwan and lends legitimacy to Vladimir Putin’s goals in Ukraine.” Titus said Trump, who calls himself “the ‘President of Peace’ has once again shown that he is the ‘Commander-in-Chaos.’”
Titus faces challenges in 2026 from six Republicans, including State Sen. Carrie Buck, who did not respond to requests for comment on Trump’s takeover of Venezuela. 
Rep. Susie Lee, also a Democrat, said Maduro’s capture raises “more questions for the Trump Administration than answers. The American people are opposed to another forever war.”
Lee noted that taking control of Venezuela is “an act of war, not a law-enforcement activity, and requires Congressional authorization and clear legal authority, neither of which the Administration has been given.” 
Three Republicans vying to replace Lee are praising Trump’s actions. 
Dr. Aury Nagy praised Trump’s “decisive leadership” but a spokesman was unable to say whether Nagy supports putting U.S. troops in Venezuela. 
Marty O’Donnell, who is prioritizing affordability in his campaign, commended Trump and the military for taking decisive action without loss of life to Americans. 
Dr. Jeff Gunter, who served as an ambassador during Trump’s first term, praised the military action that resulted in Maduro’s capture as a “’lawful, moral, and necessary’ step to protect American families from drug cartels and liberate Venezuela from socialist tyranny.”
Gunter is best known in political circles for an attack ad in the 2024 Republican primary race for U.S. Senate, in which he portrayed fellow Republican Sam Brown as a swamp creature. Brown was disfigured by an improvised explosive device in 2008 in Afghanistan, where he was serving in the U.S. Army. 
Gunter did not respond when asked whether he supports U.S. troops on the ground in Venezuela. 
Rep. Steven Horsford, a Nevada Democrat, echoed colleagues in asserting Trump’s actions “appeared to be driven largely by access to Venezuela’s oil resources.”
“Nevadans struggling through the Trump Slump get no relief from another reckless attempt at nation-building abroad,” he said. “President Trump is occupying Venezuela for corporate oil profits while the American people are clamoring for affordability relief here at home.”
David Flippo, one of several Republicans seeking to oust Horsford, praised Trump’s actions. In a statement, the former Air Force commander said Trump acted “exactly how the Commander-in-Chief is supposed to act…” 
He did not respond when asked whether he supports prolonged U.S. involvement and troops in Venezuela. 
Cody Whipple, another Republican seeking to represent Horsford’s Congressional District 4, applauded Trump’s capture of Maduro.
“Operations like this send a clear and unmistakable message: the United States will not tolerate criminal regimes poisoning our communities with fentanyl and other deadly drugs,” Whipple said in a statement. He did not say whether he supports deploying U.S. troops to Venezuela.

We reached out to all the stakeholders from the sheriff’s department, the fire department, the police department, the county and the League of Municipalities, on how to get the services to the individuals when they need them,” Treadaway said in an interview after a meeting of the commission on Monday. “I think we’ve accomplished that. I think that they’re going to be able to get those services.”

According to the Mayo Clinic, both the symptoms of PTSD and when they arise can vary from person to person. Typically, symptoms appear within the first three months of the traumatic event, but it could also take years and last for a year, or more. Symptoms are grouped into four categories, according to the clinic: intrusive memories, avoidance, negative changes in thinking and mood, and changes in physical and emotional reactions.
According to a 2023 study, about 1% of all suicides in the United States between 2015 and 2017 were first responders. Most of them were law enforcement officers, followed by firefighters.
The report is not available to the public until it is submitted to the Speaker of the House and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate. The commission has until Jan. 15 to do so. But Legislative Attorney Jeff Condra walked members of the commission through its contents on Monday. 
“The overall purpose of the report is to demonstrate to the Senate president pro tem and to the House speaker that the commission was faithful to its charge,” Condra said.
Condra said the report contains the discussions of the commission’s October and November meetings. It also includes the findings of a survey the commission sent to first responders and veterans across the state.
“There are key insights from the survey responses that were gleaned by the study commission: the need for better communication to first responders about available mental health resources, the fact that health insurance is provided through the local government, their health care insurance program does include mental health treatment, the importance of peer support, and the fact that a lot of these current problems kind of operate in isolation from one another,” Condra said. “Which means that there could be a lot of inefficiency, and there can be gaps in what we might call the continuum of care.”
The report also includes a communication plan from the Alabama Department of Mental Health (ADMH) that aims to increase awareness of available resources. 
“This plan focuses on the existing resources so that it’s easier for them to be told about it, and then actually access those resources,” Malissa Valdes, public information officer for ADMH, told the commission on Monday.
Valdes said ADMH will measure the success of the communication plan by tracking usage of the 988 suicide hotline, downloads of the Connect Alabama app and social media analytics. 
“We feel people will actually utilize this in order to reduce stigma, actually go out there and get help, create the mental health resilience that they need in order to help with PTSD,” she said.
Treadaway, who was a police officer for 31 years, said that awareness of resources is the biggest issue and that he learned about many programs through the commission.
“I think what we’re learning each year is that mental health has a lot of challenges, and the state of Alabama and the Legislature is ready to meet those challenges,” Treadaway said in an interview after the meeting.
Treadaway said additional legislation is possible but not guaranteed for the 2026 legislative session, which begins on Jan. 13.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_5915-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-06 08:12:06.784381

Dan Caine at Mar-a-Lago Saturday, January 3, 2026. (Official White House Photo by Molly Riley)An image circulated over media the weekend of Jan. 3 and 4 was meant to convey dominance: Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, blindfolded and handcuffed aboard a U.S. naval vessel. Shortly after the operation that seized Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, President Donald Trump announced that the United States would now “run” Venezuela until a “safe, proper and judicious transition” could be arranged.
The Trump administration’s move is not an aberration; it reflects a broader trend in U.S. foreign policy I described here some six years ago as “America the Bully.”
Washington increasingly relies on coercion – military, economic and political – not only to deter adversaries but to compel compliance from weaker nations. This may deliver short-term obedience, but it is counterproductive as a strategy for building durable power, which depends on legitimacy and capacity. When coercion is applied to governance, it can harden resistance, narrow diplomatic options and transform local political failures into contests of national pride.
There is no dispute that Maduro’s dictatorship led to Venezuela’s catastrophic collapse. Under his rule, Venezuela’s economy imploded, democratic institutions were hollowed out, criminal networks fused with the state, and millions fled the country – many for the United States.
But removing a leader – even a brutal and incompetent one – is not the same as advancing a legitimate political order.
 Force doesn’t equal legitimacy

By declaring its intent to govern Venezuela, the United States is creating a governance trap of its own making – one in which external force is mistakenly treated as a substitute for domestic legitimacy.
I write as a scholar of international security, civil wars and U.S. foreign policy, and as author of “Dying by the Sword,” which examines why states repeatedly reach for military solutions, and why such interventions rarely produce durable peace.
The core finding of that research is straightforward: Force can topple rulers, but it cannot generate political authority.
When violence and what I have described elsewhere as “kinetic diplomacy” become a substitute for full spectrum action – which includes diplomacy, economics and what the late political scientist Joseph Nye called “soft power” – it tends to deepen instability rather than resolve it.
 More force, less statecraft

The Venezuela episode reflects this broader shift in how the United States uses its power. My co-author Sidita Kushi and I document this by analyzing detailed data from the new Military Intervention Project. We show that since the end of the Cold War, the United States has sharply increased the frequency of military interventions while systematically underinvesting in diplomacy and other tools of statecraft.
One striking feature of the trends we uncover is that if Americans tended to justify excessive military intervention during the Cold War between 1945–1989 due to the perception that the Soviet Union was an existential threat, what we would expect is far fewer military interventions following the Soviet Union’s 1991 collapse. That has not happened.
Even more striking, the mission profile has changed. Interventions that once aimed at short-term stabilization now routinely expand into prolonged governance and security management, as they did in both Iraq after 2003 and Afghanistan after 2001.
This pattern is reinforced by institutional imbalance. In 2026, for every single dollar the United States invests in the diplomatic “scalpel” of the State Department to prevent conflict, it allocates US$28 to the military “hammer” of the Department of Defense, effectively ensuring that force becomes a first rather than last resort.
“Kinetic diplomacy” – in the Venezuela case, regime change by force – becomes the default not because it is more effective, but because it is the only tool of statecraft immediately available. On Jan. 4, Trump told the Atlantic magazine that if Delcy Rodríguez, the acting leader of Venezuela, “doesn’t do what’s right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro.”
 Lessons from Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya

The consequences of this imbalance are visible across the past quarter-century.
In Afghanistan, the U.S.-led attempt to engineer authority built on external force alone proved brittle by its very nature. The U.S. had invaded Afghanistan in 2001 to topple the Taliban regime, deemed responsible for the 9/11 terrorist attacks. But the subsequent two decades of foreign-backed state-building collapsed almost instantly once U.S. forces withdrew in 2021. No amount of reconstruction spending could compensate for the absence of a political order rooted in domestic consent.
Following the invasion by the U.S. and surrender of Iraq’s armed forces in 2003, both the U.S. Department of State and the Department of Defense proposed plans for Iraq’s transition to a stable democratic nation. President George W. Bush gave the nod to the Defense Department’s plan.
That plan, unlike the State Department’s, ignored key cultural, social and historical conditions. Instead, it proposed an approach that assumed a credible threat to use coercion, supplemented by private contractors, would prove sufficient to lead to a rapid and effective transition to a democratic Iraq. The United States became responsible not only for security, but also for electricity, water, jobs and political reconciliation – tasks no foreign power can perform without becoming, as the United States did, an object of resistance.
Libya demonstrated a different failure mode. There, intervention by a U.S.-backed NATO force in 2011 and removal of dictator Moammar Gadhafi and his regime were not followed by governance at all. The result was civil war, fragmentation, militia rule and a prolonged struggle over sovereignty and economic development that continues today.
The common thread across all three cases is hubris: the belief that American management – either limited or oppressive – could replace political legitimacy.
Venezuela’s infrastructure is already in ruins. If the United States assumes responsibility for governance, it will be blamed for every blackout, every food shortage and every bureaucratic failure. The liberator will quickly become the occupier.
 Costs of ‘running’ a country

Taking on governance in Venezuela would also carry broader strategic costs, even if those costs are not the primary reason the strategy would fail.
A military attack followed by foreign administration is a combination that undermines the principles of sovereignty and nonintervention that underpin the international order the United States claims to support. It complicates alliance diplomacy by forcing partners to reconcile U.S. actions with the very rules they are trying to defend elsewhere.
The United States has historically been strongest when it anchored an open sphere built on collaboration with allies, shared rules and voluntary alignment. Launching a military operation and then assuming responsibility for governance shifts Washington toward a closed, coercive model of power – one that relies on force to establish authority and is prohibitively costly to sustain over time.
These signals are read not only in Berlin, London and Paris. They are watched closely in Taipei, Tokyo and Seoul — and just as carefully in Beijing and Moscow.
When the United States attacks a sovereign state and then claims the right to administer it, it weakens its ability to contest rival arguments that force alone, rather than legitimacy, determines political authority.
Beijing needs only to point to U.S. behavior to argue that great powers rule as they please where they can – an argument that can justify the takeover of Taiwan. Moscow, likewise, can cite such precedent to justify the use of force in its near abroad and not just in Ukraine.
This matters in practice, not theory. The more the United States normalizes unilateral governance, the easier it becomes for rivals to dismiss American appeals to sovereignty as selective and self-serving, and the more difficult it becomes for allies to justify their ties to the U.S.
That erosion of credibility does not produce dramatic rupture, but it steadily narrows the space for cooperation over time and the advancement of U.S. interests and capabilities.
Force is fast. Legitimacy is slow. But legitimacy is the only currency that buys durable peace and stability – both of which remain enduring U.S. interests.
If Washington governs by force in Venezuela, it will repeat the failures of Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya: Power can topple regimes, but it cannot create political authority. Outside rule invites resistance, not stability.

Wired for Profit: Second in a series about Alabama Power’s influence over electric rates, renewable energy, pollution and politics in the Yellowhammer State.
There’s a curious sight on the far-left wall of the Alabama Public Service Commission’s main hearing room.
Framed 8-by-10-inch photos of the previous commissioners dating back to 1881 line the wall. The photos are black and white. The commissioners are just white, but that’s not the strange part.
The strange part is that in the bottom left quadrant of the photo wall, directly above the most recent former commissioner, Twinkle Andress Cavanaugh, hangs the smiling mug of one of the most notorious faces in Alabama history.

Eugene “Bull” Connor, the former Birmingham police commissioner whose brutal suppression of civil rights demonstrations with police dogs and firehoses drew worldwide condemnation, stares back at the observer with his slicked-back white hair, horn-rimmed glasses and the slight vestige of a smile.
Connor, after his presence became an untenable black eye for the city of Birmingham, was shuffled off to Montgomery and the Alabama Public Service Commission, where he served as PSC president from 1965-1973.
Alabama’s civil rights history is inescapable, even in places most people wouldn’t expect. Their electric bills, for example.
George Wallace, the four-term governor who famously stood in the schoolhouse door in an attempt to prevent Black students from enrolling at the University of Alabama, was never on the commission, but may be as responsible as any single political figure for the state of Alabama’s electric regulation today.
That’s because throughout the 1970s, when crying “segregation forever” was no longer a viable political strategy, Wallace needed a new target for his brand of populist demagoguery. He found it in Alabama Power.
Wallace railed against what he called Alabama Power’s “exorbitant rates” for years, attempting to thwart or delay nearly every rate increase or construction project the company proposed. That campaign turned the state’s regulatory environment into a circus, pushed the state’s largest utility to the verge of bankruptcy and provoked a backlash that still clouds the ratemaking process
David Rountree worked at the PSC for 12 years in the 1990s, 2000s and 2010s, including stints as chief of staff or principal advisor for three different commissioners. Rountree said Wallace’s actions still reverberated through the PSC building decades later. Years before joining the PSC staff, Rountree had actually covered some of the hearings as a reporter for the Montgomery Advertiser newspaper.
“Those rate hearings were just a nightmare,” Rountree told Inside Climate News. “Nobody wanted to get sent over to have to cover a PSC rate hearing. It was like, ‘Can you just pull my fingernails out?’ And they would last for months on end.”
After years of Wallace’s chaotic attacks on the system, the PSC snapped back hard in the other direction. The commissioners attempted to create a system that would take political chaos out of utility ratemaking and prevent another George Wallace from hijacking the regulatory process. Rate increases were put on “autopilot,” Rountree said, going up automatically whenever Alabama Power’s earnings fell below a certain percentage.
The commission voted to approve the new system, called rate stabilization and equalization, or RSE, in 1982. That was the last time Alabama Power held a formal rate case that nearly all other states require. The RSE process did its job of averting contentious and costly rate cases, but there were serious side effects. One, according to environmentalists and public interest lawyers, has been a lack of transparency and almost any meaningful public participation.
The public rate cases that had become so toxic under Wallace had been eliminated, but those hearings served as the best method for the public to gain insight into how their power bills were calculated, and which utility decisions they were paying for. Now the public and advocate groups have to fight and claw for information that is public and easily accessible in other jurisdictions.
In a 2013 white paper titled “Public Utility Regulation without the Public,” the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis writes that Alabama’s RSE process “allows Alabama Power to adjust its charges each year without any public evidentiary hearings and, indeed, without any participation by ratepaying consumers whatsoever other than off-the-record and after-the-fact comments at an informal hearing that completely lacks public transparency.”
The paper states that only Louisiana and Mississippi have similar processes for utility regulation, but notes that those states have more “meaningful opportunities for public involvement.”
A spokesperson for Alabama Power told Inside Climate News that the RSE process still ensures oversight over the company, even if it differs from other states.
“Alabama’s Rate RSE framework provides continuous, formula-based oversight with monthly filings, annual PSC review, and automatic refunds or adjustments when earnings fall outside the approved range,” Alabama Power said. “Different structure does not equal lack of regulation.”
The Alabama Public Service Commission is in the process of completing its required review of Rate RSE that takes place every six years. It is not clear when the findings of that review will be made public.
“Following the review process engaged in by staff with representatives from Alabama Power and the Alabama Attorney General’s office, staff will consult with the Commission and provide an assessment of the effectiveness of Rate RSE and discuss any potential modifications deemed necessary,” a PSC spokesman said in an email. “The Commission will determine whether any further course or courses of action are necessary based on those consultations with staff. Any determination regarding the need for outside input will not be made until the Commission has made an assessment of the findings compiled by staff.”
Alabama Power went from the precipice of bankruptcy to being one of the most stable and profitable utilities in the country. But its customers shouldered the highest total electric bills in the country last year, according to an Inside Climate News analysis, and pay the highest electric rates in the Southeast.
Advocates who have criticized Alabama Power’s high returns point to the RSE process as a key reason that the company’s profits are so high.
Here’s how it happened.

George Wallace v. the Power Company

To say Wallace was popular in Alabama through the 1960s and ‘70s is an enormous understatement. He was elected governor of Alabama four times from 1962 to 1982, bouncing in and out of the governorship as term limits allowed. He didn’t leave the governor’s office for good until 1987.
In 1966, the Alabama constitution did not allow governors to serve consecutive terms, blocking Wallace from seeking reelection. So Wallace’s wife, Lurleen Wallace, ran for governor in his stead, explicitly stating that her husband would stay in control. Her name appeared on the ballot as “Mrs. George C. Wallace,” and she won handily, winning the primary without a runoff and garnering 63 percent of the general election vote. Alabama would not elect another female governor until 2018.
Lurleen Wallace died of cancer 16 months into her term, casting the Wallaces temporarily out of the governor’s office. Doctors reportedly told Wallace of his wife’s cancer as early as 1961, but he insisted she not be told, delaying any possible treatment for years. She remained unaware of her condition until 1965, when a different doctor told her directly. Despite her condition, she handled a rigorous campaign schedule throughout 1966, but her health began to deteriorate shortly after taking office.
Lurleen Wallace died in 1968. That same year, Alabama voters approved a constitutional amendment to allow governors to serve two consecutive terms, setting the stage for George Wallace to run and win in 1970, 1974 and 1982.
In 1970, as Wallace campaigned to retake the governor’s office after his first interregnum, he campaigned against “banks and utilities and the rich on Wall Street who don’t pay their taxes,” former Newsweek columnist Stewart Alsop wrote at the time.
Alsop added that Wallace’s “attacks on the big newspapers, the banks, and the utilities account for that electric current in his shirt-sleeved crowds at least as much as the race issue.”
After his reelection, Wallace hired well-known attorney Maurice Bishop to formally intervene in the rate cases at the PSC. A handful of commissioners elected in the next several years had close ties to Wallace or at least shared his views on Alabama Power’s rates.

Meanwhile, Wallace held rallies and gave televised speeches criticizing the power company and called multiple special sessions of the legislature in unsuccessful attempts to give the governor’s office and/or the Alabama Supreme Court the power to directly overrule the PSC on electricity rates. Wallace was unwilling to compromise on any of those issues, which never advanced past the state Senate. He blamed Alabama Power for wielding “undue influence” over senators who balked at his proposals. Some of the senators pushed back.
“George Wallace had made a career out of raising emotional issues and demagoging his way into office,” state Sen. Joe Fine said, according to the Montgomery Advertiser. “First he used the race issue, black against white, but [now] that’s run out.”
In June 1976, the PSC rejected a rate increase request from Alabama Power, which the company’s president Joseph Farley called “shocking and dismaying.” The company appealed the PSC’s decision to the Montgomery County Circuit Court, which ordered the PSC to grant at least a partial increase. Alabama Power appealed that decision to the state Supreme Court.
The pattern would continue for several years, with rate cases bouncing between the PSC and the courts, and with Alabama Power repeatedly filing emergency rate cases before the courts had ruled on its previous rate increases.
People angry over their electric bills were bussed to PSC meetings from across the state. PSC hearings were moved to larger venues to accommodate the crowds.
Financial firm Standard and Poor’s dropped Alabama Power’s credit rating from A- to BBB. The company was forced to rely on high interest, short-term loans to stay afloat due to the long lag between rate increase decisions.

1977: ‘The terrible year’

In the book “Developed for the Service of Alabama,” a company history published by Alabama Power in 2006, historian Leah Rawls Atkins calls 1977 “the terrible year,” though 1978 and 1979 may have even been worse.
Skyrocketing prices caused by inflation and the oil embargo were creating huge costs for the company, and the clashes in Montgomery put the company on its most perilous financial footing since its early days of existence.
In January, an emergency rate case hearing was relocated to Montgomery’s Garrett Coliseum, where huge crowds packed the arena for what was, by most accounts, a circus.
Media reports at the time estimated the crowd ranging from 800 to 2,000 people, more or less evenly split between those who supported Alabama Power’s rate increases—power company employees, steelworkers, construction workers, economic development officials—and those who opposed the increases.
More than 50 witnesses testified, ranging from Alabama Power executives and expert witnesses to everyday Alabamians worried about their ability to pay higher bills in times of economic downturn and inflation.
Stewart B. Clifford, a senior vice president at Citibank, testified as a representative of a nine-bank syndicate that had granted Alabama Power $350 million in short-term loans over two years.
“None of them are willing, under present conditions, to extend any additional credit to Alabama Power,” Clifford said, according to The Birmingham News.
Meanwhile, numerous residents, many elderly, testified that they would not be able to pay their power bills if the increase were approved. So did construction workers who said they would be laid off if Alabama Power were not allowed to build the infrastructure it was planning.
One of the commissioners stated he believed the rate increase to be illegal because a previous rate increase was still awaiting judgment in the Alabama Supreme Court.
At one point in the two-day hearing, officials resorted to playing Simon and Garfunkel’s “Bridge Over Troubled Water” over the PA system to ease the tensions.
In the end, the PSC approved a smaller increase than the company asked for, but the struggles continued for the next two years.
In 1978, after Alabama Power reported a dramatic drop in earnings due to the newly constructed Joseph M. Farley nuclear power plant, the PSC approved an emergency rate increase to steady the ship in November, after that year’s elections. Wallace appealed and got a court to issue an injunction blocking the rate increase.
In December, the company filed a request for an emergency $288.8 million rate increase, saying its return on equity had fallen to a “disastrous” 4.5 percent.
According to Rawls’ book, Alabama Power responded by freezing officer salaries, cutting back construction projects and paying its bills only on an as-needed basis. The company sold five of its buildings with agreements to rent the spaces instead, freeing up cash, but losing out in the long run.
In January 1979, the Alabama Supreme Court denied Alabama Power’s motion to lift the injunction blocking its rate increase. The court found the PSC’s rate increases null and void and dismissed all appeals.
Rawls’ book quotes Alabama Power comptroller Jack Minor as saying the company had $45 million in unpaid bills and was unable to borrow money or sell stocks or bonds to cover them. He reported stacked invoices on his desk, not to be paid “until someone demands payment.”
The company put word out that it would remember which vendors were forgiving of its struggles, and which were not. Rawls says that there were some major suppliers that showed a “lack of support during this critical time,” and that Alabama Power “never did business with them again.”
Alan Martin, who held many executive positions in Alabama Power, including senior vice president, said executives in the company who experienced those times came out stronger for it.
“The enduring effect was positive,” Martin said in Rawls’ book. “Those who lived through those years were like the World War II generation. We were tougher. Our leadership has been real conservative, but when the company is criticized, we are quick to jump like a tiger to defend it.”

A solution emerges

By 1982, it was clear that the situation was untenable. Even Wallace and those in his administration conceded that something had to change.
Billy Joe Camp, Wallace’s former advisor and spokesman, had been elected PSC president, and he and the other commissioners implemented the rate stabilization and equalization system.
The goal of the system was to put utility ratemaking on autopilot, removing the possibility of messy rate case battles and political grandstanding that dominated the previous decade.
“At times the rate structure was used as a political football,” Camp said, according to the Associated Press. “I was part of that irresponsibility sometimes. We had to get to a new environment.”
An approved rate of return range was set for Alabama Power at 13 to 14.5 percent of the value of its common equity. Every December, if the company’s earnings for the coming year were projected to fall below that range, rates would go up automatically in January. If the company earned more in the course of the year than its allowed range, some of that money would be refunded to customers the next year.
The new system did not require a vote by the commission to increase rates, nor were there any public rate hearings or formal testimony from the utility on its revenue. In trying to stop political manipulation of the rate system, the PSC nearly removed the public from the process altogether, limiting the opportunities for public engagement or even understanding of the ratemaking process.

Instead, the PSC hosts informal hearings each year in December. The company presents its latest revenue figures for the year in progress and projections for the coming year, as well details about its environmental compliance plans for the next five years.
Company representatives answer questions from PSC staff, the attorney general’s office or members of the public, but they are not under oath as they would be in a formal rate case. The commissioners, if they attend, sit in the audience with everyone else. Proceedings are not streamed online, as regular PSC meetings are.
Christina Tidwell, a senior attorney for the Southern Environmental Law Center, attends the informal sessions on behalf of SELC clients, asking questions about Alabama Power’s profits, or issues like renewable energy adoption, coal ash cleanup plans, energy efficiency or electric vehicle charging programs offered by the company.
The one-day hearing typically lasts about four hours.
“The informal meetings held in December are the only opportunity for the public to ask Alabama Power questions about its environmental compliance costs or its profits,” Tidwell said in an email. “They are limited in scope—there is no discovery or opportunity to offer expert testimony and Alabama Power’s witnesses are not under oath. There is also no transcript of the meeting.
“It’s unclear to me what role these hearings play in overall utility regulation.”

High interest rates preserved for decades

One criticism of the RSE process is that utility return rates were locked in at 1982 rates for more than 40 years. And the early 1980s featured the highest interest rates since at least the 1950s thanks to inflation control measures taken by the Federal Reserve.
As Alabama Power demonstrated during its turbulent times in the 1970s, a utility company needs to earn returns higher than benchmark interest rates in order to attract investors to fund its operations and construction projects. If investors can get similar returns on government bonds, there’s little incentive to wade into the slightly riskier waters of utility companies, where politicians could scuttle or delay needed rate increases.
In 1981, the U.S. average interest rate spiked to 16.38 percent, dropping to 12.26 percent in 1982. But after 1982, interest rates dropped sharply for decades. This year, it is 4.21 percent after spending much of the past 20 years at near-zero levels in the wake of the 2008 economic crash and the COVID pandemic.
Utilities in other jurisdictions had to appear before state regulators periodically to justify their return rates, which dropped as well in many cases. Yet Alabama Power kept earning the same margins.
The only major change to the system occurred in 2013, when the PSC switched from using the industry-standard return on equity metric to evaluate Alabama Power’s profit margins to a novel weighted retail return metric developed for Alabama. The new metric gives Alabama Power additional incentives for having a higher percentage of equity as opposed to debt, a good thing when measuring financial health of the utility, but also made it harder to compare Alabama Power’s returns to other utilities.
By then, the 13 to 14.5 percent returns guaranteed by RSE were among the highest in the nation. After the adoption of the weighted return, Alabama Power’s return on equity remained around 13 percent through 2020, but has since dropped to around 11 percent.

Rountree, the former PSC employee who served as chief of staff to then-Commissioner Terry Dunn when the switch was made in 2013, said the change seemed mostly cosmetic, to deflect criticism over the high allowed returns.
By that time, Rountree said Dunn was being boxed out by the other commissioners, having advocated strongly for formal rate hearings that the other commissioners opposed.
“I crunched a lot of numbers back in the day when they were doing that, because I wanted to make sure that I understood it, and Commissioner Dunn wanted to make sure that we knew what they were doing,” Rountree said. “It looked to me like basically what they were trying to do was refashion the presentation of the numbers so that they look more benign.”
Dunn was the lone PSC commissioner to oppose the change to weighted returns, as he had been the only commissioner criticizing Alabama Power’s high return rates. Dunn lost the Republican primary the next year, after what he called a “smear campaign” linking him to national environmental groups and criticism from other Republicans.
Alabama Power’s return on equity, based on figures included in its federal Securities and Exchange Commission filings, remained above 13 percent through 2020, falling to around 11 percent after that. It is on track to earn about 11.1 percent this year, per filings with the PSC.
Last year’s nationwide average return on equity for an electric utility approved by state regulators was 9.74 percent, according to S&P Global.
Those handful of percentage points can add up. The Energy and Policy Institute, a nonprofit advocacy group, calculated in 2020 that from 2014 through 2018, Alabama Power earned over $1 billion more in profit than it would have if it earned industry-average returns.
The group found that Alabama Power’s profits over those five years totaled $4.26 billion at around a 13 percent return on equity. The group estimates that at industry average rates of return 9.75 percent, Alabama Power would have earned $3.24 billion.
Alabama Power is projected to earn $1.56 billion in profit this year, according to its filings.
The utility agreed to a two-year rate freeze this year with the PSC, intended to avoid increases through 2027, as concerns mount about high rates and the potential need for new generation to accommodate hyperscale data center projects that are currently being planned in Alabama.
U.S. Sen. Katie Britt has, on multiple occasions, said that Alabama Power has the “highest rates in the Southeast,” and called the situation “unacceptable.”
Alabama Power and the PSC have said that any data center customers will pay the “full and fair costs” of their operations, including any new infrastructure that is required. Specific details of those contracts however will likely not be made publicly available.
Rountree said he believes it is vital that utilities be allowed to earn a fair return on their investments.
“In utility regulation, you’re trying to have your public utilities do the job they’re supposed to do as best they can, and as efficiently as they can,” Rountree said. “It’s very important to make sure that you don’t starve them to death, that they have the wherewithal to do it well.”
Rountree credits Alabama Power for being a “first-rate utility” and for helping recruit major industries like Mercedes-Benz and Hyundai to build facilities in Alabama. But he also believes the returns are too much.
“Perhaps in the earlier years, giving Alabama Power that extra boost of return to build itself into a well-operating, good utility, maybe there was some wisdom there,” Rountree said. “But by God, I think it’s unfair, and I think it should be less than it is, the allowed rate of return.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/George-wallace-horizontal-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-06 07:11:40.876744

Among contaminants the city found exceeding state health thresholds on some home demolition sites are arsenic, chromium, lead, and PAHs, a highly toxic class of chemicals that suggests parking lots or roadways were used as backfill. 
Test results show the city is not testing dirt on the demolition sites’ surfaces. The surfaces must be checked to fully and accurately gauge the health risk, independent experts say. That and other testing gaps may leave residents living next to unsafe toxic waste sites as Duggan leaves to run for governor. 
The gaps show “total ignorance,” of proper testing protocol, said Allen Burton, an ecosystems management researcher with the University of Michigan who studies the health risks in sites contaminated with toxic substances. 
“They don’t really know what’s going on at these sites,” Burton told Michigan Advance. “They should go out and sample the part that people are exposed to – the surface. That would answer the question of ‘Is there a health risk?’”

The Duggan administration has maintained there was no way to prevent the problem, a claim public health advocates say is untrue. The failure to address the contaminated soil, and the ongoing “dirtgate,” as some observers have dubbed it, raises questions about the success of Duggan’s blight elimination program, which he touts as he runs for governor as an independent.
“If you want to find fault, it’s in them not having a robust method for avoiding this,” said Steve Hoin, a former state regulator who worked on previous Detroit demolition site remediations. “How did this fail in the first place? It doesn’t lend confidence to the whole thing.” 
 A Duggan gubernatorial campaign spokesperson in an email statement said, “None of that is true. Every time there [w]as an issue, the dirt was tested.” 
However, no experts suggested the dirt was never tested – they allege the testing is inadequate to determine a risk. 
The Duggan administration has previously said the fact that it caught the contaminated dirt is evidence of its protocols’ success. 
Duggan announced on Dec. 22 that around 425 Detroit home demolition sites were potentially backfilled with toxic dirt that may in effect create hundreds of small toxic waste dumps throughout the city’s neighborhoods. That came after a Detroit Office of Inspector General report found 42 of 47 home sites it reviewed had dirt that was “unsafe for direct human contact.” 
The December announcement marks the fifth contaminated dirt discovery during Duggan’s tenure, in which his administration demolished around 30,000 abandoned structures.
Duggan and the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy, or EGLE, did not release which contaminants were in the dirt until Dec. 29, after The Guardian published a report stating that the information was being withheld. 
Officials have said some debris from the demolished Northland Shopping Mall was used to fill former basements and level demolition sites. Other sources of contaminated construction slag were used, but officials have not disclosed which. 
Some of the contaminants found on the sites are carcinogens, linked to neurological damage or present other serious health risks at very low exposure levels. Those living around the sites face a long-term health risk from dust. The situation presents a more immediate risk for kids playing in the neighborhood, or for those gardening, experts say. 
The city tested dirt samples from between 1-2 feet and 5-6 feet below the surface. It is removing dirt at sites where there are exceedances of state health thresholds for direct contact or inhalation. 

DRAFT_DETR0060_3526_Beatrice.TCLP_.RPT_REV.12.12.25 
Independent remediation experts said the testing and removal was a good step, but it does not cover the most likely exposure risk for neighbors – the surface dirt. Even if the dirt was removed, residents may have been exposed for years. 
Hoin, a former EGLE geologist, said the city’s testing did not aim to determine whether surface dirt had put neighbors’ health at risk. Instead, it aimed to determine if the backfill was toxic to a level at which state law triggered a cleanup. 
“The goal was to determine if the bulk fill material was contaminated and needed to be removed, not to determine whether there was a risk to hypothetical neighborhood kids,” Hoin said. 
Hoin praised the city’s testing, which he said looked for a wide range of contaminants and took a “conservative” approach to determining removal. But he said asking whether residents have been, or are, safe is a different question. That would require testing the surface, Hoin said. 
Nick Leonard, director of the Great Lakes Environmental Law Center in Detroit, said it is “commonplace” in these situations for the surface to be tested because “that is typically the dirt that people are going to be exposed to.” 
The city may not have sampled the surfaces because the sites were allegedly covered with a foot of clean topsoil. During his December 22 press conference, Duggan downplayed the health threat, stating that there would only be a risk “if you were to dig through the foot of topsoil and spend a lot of time digging in the dirt.”
However, the contractors have allegedly lied about the source of their dirt, raising questions about whether topsoil was actually spread, whether it was clean, or whether a full foot was spread across each site.  
Even if a foot of clean topsoil was spread, that depth is not considered an adequate toxic waste cap for residential redevelopment, U of M’s Burton said. Caps require a thicker layer, a membrane, or several feet of clay. 
Meanwhile, the city is not removing dirt at sites in which it did not find exceedances of state health thresholds for individual contaminants. But multiple toxic chemicals are at the sites, and low levels of lead, PAHs, arsenic, chromium and other toxins in combination could present a risk, even if the individual levels do not exceed health thresholds. 
Regulations do not cover multiple exposures at once. The leaves people living next door to sites that have been determined to be safe facing a potential health threat. Leonard said exposure to multiple carcinogens can especially increase the risk of cancer.  
Most of the contaminants found at high levels are carcinogens, though Leonard added that there are a number of factors that determine cancer risk, like the route and length of exposure. 
“But it’s certainly not a good thing to be exposed to a multitude of different environmental risks, particularly for Detroiters who in some respects are more susceptible to these risks for a variety of reasons,” Leonard said. 
The inadequate testing is not unique to Detroit. The government often develops testing plans or protocols that are not designed to fully determine a health risk. 
In a late December email, then-Duggan administration spokesperson John Roach said it is impossible to stop contractors from using contaminated dirt. 
“There is no protocol that suggests the City of Detroit has any legal authority to supervise and regulate the day-to-day operations of landfills or gravel pits in Oakland County – that authority belongs to EGLE,” Roach said. 
But Leonard said the city could contractually require dirt contractors to test dirt, or the city could sample the dirt. However, that would have slowed the demolition program on which Duggan is now campaigning. 
“I think it’s safe to say that the city prioritized getting things done quickly, and at the price of getting things done in a proper way that protected people,” Leonard said.

She’s pro. He’s against.
As city council members in Pasco and Lynden, respectively, they fought two of seven battles in Washington in the past two years over fluoridation in public water supplies. Those fights reflect a spike in skepticism about the long-time, dental-related practice supported by health experts. Washington already is below the national average in residents served by fluoridated water.
Barajas, who left office in recent weeks after not seeking reelection, grew up in Salinas, California, where she began raising two sons.
Salinas’ water system did not have fluoride. Barajas had to stretch a small family budget to provide fluoride to protect her boys’ teeth. After moving to Pasco 20 years ago, she got heavily involved in the community, becoming a city council member in 2018 and later serving as mayor.
A proposal went to the Pasco City Council last year to eliminate fluoride from the city’s water system because of concerns about the health effects and wanting citizens to make their own decisions about fluoride.
With one seat empty, the council split 3-3 on taking this matter to a public ballot. A follow-up vote on just the council making the decision passed 4-2 to remove the fluoride. Mayor David Milne hesitantly switched sides to apparently put the issue to bed on Nov. 17.
“It’s a disservice to those children. It’s a disservice to those families,” Barajas said.
Meanwhile, Bode has been on the Lynden City Council for 26 years. He has read lots of literature criticizing fluoridation as a health risk — lower IQs, softening bones in senior citizens, and damaging pineal glands, part of the brain that helps regulate sleep cycles.
“There’s a laundry list of studies,” Bode said.
More than two years ago, and minus one member, Lynden’s council began holding hearings and debates on ending fluoridation. It voted 4-2 to remove fluoride, but the mayor vetoed the decision. The council went through the whole process again to get a veto-proof 5-2 vote on April 21.
“This is the most important thing I’ve done for public health,” Bode said.
Health and dental experts say there appears to be an increase in anti-fluoridation efforts involving local governments, although they do not collect statistics for comparison.
Along with Pasco and Lynden, the city councils of Aberdeen and Camas have voted to remove fluoridation from their water supplies in 2024 and 2025. The Longview and Battle Ground councils voted to reject anti-fluoridation efforts. Yakima’s council is pondering the issue.
Washington’s state health department policy is to leave this matter up to local governments. “Some people think it infringes on their autonomy in their decisions on what goes into their bodies,” said state health officer Tao Kwan-Gett of the Washington State Department of Health.
This year, 46% of Washington residents have access to public fluoridated water, according to the department. It did not have percentages for previous years. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that about 72% of Americans had access to fluoridated water in 2022.
The state health department, the Washington State Dental Association and the statewide dental lobbying organization, the Arcora Foundation, are not aware on any coordinated effort to remove fluoridation, but pointed to U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s national push to stop fluoridation. 
So far, Utah and Florida have banned fluoride in public water systems.
“These (Washington efforts) are grassroots organizing. But the national narrative is driving it,” said Chris Dorow, outgoing president of the Washington State Dental Association and the only dentist in Othello. The natural water around Othello is already high in fluorides.
The use of fluoride in drinking water dates back to Colorado Springs in 1901. Spearheaded by a Colorado Springs dentist, wondering why brown stains showed up in children’s teeth, he and other researchers spent the next 30-plus years trying to figure out why those stains occurred in Colorado Springs and a few other western areas, and not elsewhere, according to the federal National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research.
During that research, it was found that the brown-stained teeth were stronger and more resistant to cavities than other teeth. Fluorides in the natural water was pinned down as the source of brown stains and stronger teeth in the 1930s. Researchers then tackled finding a fluoridation sweet spot on strengthening teeth without causing brown stains.
Researchers found that balance, and Grand Rapids, Michigan, decided in 1945 to become the first city to fluoridate its public water supply. Fluoridation has a good track record on dental health. The CDC says the proper levels of fluoridation reduce tooth decay by 25%.
Poor oral health can cause pain and handicap a person’s ability to eat, sleep, learn and work, according to Arcora. Untreated oral disease can make chronic health conditions, like diabetes, worse. Medical costs can increase.
Percentages of tooth decay in Washington can vary from city to city. Hispanic, Native American, and Black children have consistently higher rates of tooth decay than their white counterparts, according to Arcora.
Lynden’s Bode pointed to numerous articles that linked fluoride with the loss of IQ points in children. The most commonly cited figures are a loss of 5 to 7 IQ points.
The peer-reviewed Journal of the American Medical Association looked at 74 articles on studies on the links between IQ points and fluoride. Authors of the JAMA article determined that there is a high risk of scientific bias in 52 of those studies and a low risk of bias in 22. Forty-five of the articles originated from China.
The links between fluoride and loss of intelligence show up when the fluoride levels in water are above 1.5 milligrams per liter, the JAMA review found.
“There were limited data and uncertainty in the dose-response association between fluoride exposure and children’s IQ when fluoride exposure was estimated by drinking water alone at concentrations less than 1.5 mg/L,” the JAMA review said.
“That’s much higher than what we use for public water fluoridation,” said Washington state health officer Kwan-Gett.
The CDC says the recommended level for fluoride in a public water system is 0.7 milligrams per liter. Dorow pointed to the centuries-old concept that the dose of a substance often dictates whether or not it is poisonous, not the substance itself.
“There are no negative impacts at normal levels,” Kwan-Gett said.
Regarding Bode’s concerns about pineal glands and bone health, the state health department emailed a number of observations.
The agency said that while some animal studies suggest that high levels of fluoride could affect the pineal gland, studies in humans are inconclusive and limited. And the American Dental Association says that there is no known effect of fluoride on the functions of the pineal gland.
Additionally, the department pointed to a recently published review of scientific literature that concluded low concentrations of fluoride have no significant harmful effect on bone health. A recent study reported a link between fluoride exposure and bone density and fracture risk, but that was at fluoride levels that are more than twice what is used for community water systems.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/water-faucet-1024x746.jpg,,,2026-01-06 07:11:40.876744

(Photo courtesy of the Indiana Department of Transportation)The number of nixed road and bridge plans is rising, the Indiana Department of Transportation told state lawmakers on Monday, citing “funding constraints.”
“We’ve continued to cancel projects. They’ve continued to have to be postponed,” Legislative Director Aaron Wainscott said.
INDOT reported hitting the brakes on 300 projects this time last year.
“I don’t have a specific number, but I can tell you for sure that number has continued to increase over the last 12 months,” Wainscott told the House’s Roads and Transportation Committee.
“It probably wouldn’t be real hard to get that number,” replied Committee Chair Rep. Jim Pressel, R-Rolling Prairie, who also requested the dollar amount associated with those projects.
Priority initiatives have been among those trimmed, per Wainscott.
INDOT had planned a “major” interchange improvement project northwest of Indianapolis, near Whitestown. But “due to funding constraints, we’ve had to break that into about three different projects that are going to be carried out at different times,” he said, instead of all at once.
Strategic legislative revisions aid renewed Indiana drive for tolling

Another priority project, which could cost $1 billion to build, took some heat.
The Mid-States Corridor is intended to better link State Road 66 to Interstate 69 in southern Indiana, according to its dedicated website. INDOT is still working on environmental review but plans to begin construction next year, Wainscott said, prompting disbelief from Pressel.
“We canceled over 300 projects in the last year and a half, but we’re going to spend a billion dollars on a brand-new roadway,” Pressel said. “… I’m not — I’m not getting it. … I’m really looking for some guidance on how we’re doing this, but yet we’re killing other projects.”
INDOT has eyed tolling as a potential revenue generator.
U.S. law generally bans user fees on federal-aid highways, including those that make up the Interstate Highway System. There are exceptions: two “mainstream” programs, which don’t require any state-federal tolling deal, and two application-only, limited-slot pilot programs.
Wainscott confirmed INDOT submitted a tolling application late last year to the Federal Highway Administration specifically for Interstate 70, but didn’t provide it to committee lawmakers or the Capital Chronicle.
“I’m not sure if it’s necessarily public, publicly displayed. That would not be up to me to make that decision,” he told Rep. Carey Hamilton, D-Indianapolis.
“Well, I’m officially requesting it,” she responded.
Wainscott also said INDOT has received “good feedback” on the application but noted the agency doesn’t know how long approval will take.
Gov. Mike Braun has said that he wants to capture dollars from out-of-state vehicles traveling through Indiana that don’t fill up at the gas pump.
The federal highway department previously referred the Capital Chronicle to INDOT regarding the application but didn’t say why it couldn’t disclose a copy.
Wainscott additionally reviewed early results from a highway construction speed enforcement pilot — reporting that “excessive” speeding of 11 miles per hour over the speed limit or more has dropped by 70% in camera-enforced zones. Ticket revenue goes to the state’s General Fund, not INDOT.

It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
Mississippi’s 174 legislators will return to the Capitol at noon on Tuesday for their 2026 regular session. 
This will be the third year of the current Legislature’s four-year term. Over the next three months, lawmakers will likely file 3,000 or more bills, winnow them down to a few hundred that are passed into law, and also set an over $7 billion state budget.

Already, legislative leaders have telegraphed that “school choice” and other K-12 public education policy will likely dominate the session.

Here are some of the major issues the Legislature is expected to focus on during this year’s session. 
School choice 
School choice policy, which includes allowing families to pay for alternative education options with public dollars, is set to be the top issue of the session.
Over the past year, House Speaker Jason White has led the charge to expand school choice. 

Proponents, who often refer to the policies as “education freedom,” say expansion would give parents more say over their children’s education. Opponents of school choice say the policies will siphon money away from an already underfunded public system and give it to private schools with little oversight.

The House committee White created to study school choice has met several times ahead of the session, and is stacked with pro-school choice advocates. Meetings of the Senate Education Committee, on the other hand, have centered on the public education system’s achievements, potentially setting up a clash between the two chambers of the Legislature.

White has vowed to bring the issue, and a bill, up early in the session. Public school advocates who oppose a universal voucher or school choice system in recent days on social media have told their followers a House vote on the issue could happen on day one of the session.
Mississippi already has some version of school choice — a limited education savings account system, some charter schools, and a plethora of private schools. But none of those are accessible to every student.

Teacher pay 
Mississippi teachers are among the lowest paid in the country, and legislative leaders have indicated they want to change that this year. 
The average teacher starting salary, $42,492 a year in Mississippi, ranks 40th in the nation, according to the National Education Association.
In 2022, state lawmakers passed the last meaningful teacher pay raise, an average annual increase of $5,140. But health insurance premium increases and inflation almost immediately started chipping away at the extra pay, and many other states in the region raised their salaries as well.
Even when adjusted for cost of living, Mississippi educators are the third-lowest paid in the country, nearly $9,000 less than the national average, according to a report from State Auditor Shad White.
Teachers recently told Mississippi Today that they have to keep second jobs and cut corners financially to make ends meet.

Ballot initiative 
For the fifth year in a row, lawmakers plan to introduce legislation to restore the ballot initiative, a way for citizens to circumvent the Legislature and place issues directly on a statewide ballot. 
The Mississippi Supreme Court ruled in 2021 that the prior initiative process was invalid due to some legal technicalities.
Over the last four years, the House and Senate failed to reach an agreement over how the process could be replaced.

Prison health care reform 
House Corrections Chair Becky Currie, a Republican from Brookhaven, said she will introduce legislation based on findings gleaned from numerous tours of Mississippi’s prisons as well as instances of alleged denial of medical care documented by Mississippi Today in its “Behind Bars, Beyond Care” series.
Currie last year drafted a bill that introduced several reforms, including giving authority to the Mississippi Department of Health to review prison health care and make policy changes. Other central tenets of the bill included ensuring that inmates have access to 24/7 medical care, dispensing medication in a way that ensures inmates who need it actually receive it, requiring prisons to provide communal electronic kiosks for prisoners to request medical appointments and waiving fees for a wide range of medical services.
Long considered one of the most conservative members of the Mississippi House, Currie last year secured support from the entire House, winning over everyone from tough-on-crime Republicans to criminal justice reform-minded Democrats. The bill passed 118-0 in the House. It was amended and whittled down before passing the Senate, but ultimately died in late negotiations between the chambers.
Currie believes the bill contained too many provisions, drawing opposition from the office of Gov. Tate Reeves and some of his Senate allies. To avoid a similar impasse this year, Currie will introduce many of the same measures, but in separate bills.
One key policy fix Currie plans to reintroduce this year is revamping the process by which inmates request medical attention at many prisons. Prisoners often still need to rely on guards to bring them to an infirmary. This arrangement gives guards, who are not medical professionals, the power to determine whether a prisoner receives immediate care.
Another prison health care issue Currie plans to tackle again is the spread of hepatitis C. Documents and private conversations reported by Mississippi Today show the problem appears to be widespread in state prisons.
Currie plans to keep pushing for the Department of Corrections and VitalCore to purchase hepatitis C medication through health care organizations enrolled in the federal 340B program, which requires pharmaceutical companies to sell outpatient drugs at discounted prices. The program can offer discounts on drugs in the range of 20% to 50%.
In an interview, Senate Corrections Chairman Juan Barnett, a Democrat from Heidelberg, said that he “vaguely remembered” Currie’s bill and supported some of its key provisions, but wanted to center efforts in his committee around reducing Mississippi’s prison population to free up more money for health care services.

Opioid settlement spending 
The Legislature must decide how to spend over $100 million Mississippi is receiving from a national opioid lawsuit settlement. These funds are intended to help address the state’s ongoing opioid crisis that has killed thousands of Mississippians over the past decade. 
One portion of the funds is specifically earmarked for programs to prevent and treat opioid misuse, and another smaller pot can be used for any public purpose. But the Legislature must eventually appropriate money from both of the funds. 
Lawmakers in 2025 created the Mississippi Opioid Settlement Fund Advisory Council to review grant applications from organizations proposing addiction prevention projects and make prioritized recommendations to the Legislature. The council recently recommended more than $80 million in the two highest tiers for specific projects.

Public Employee Retirement System 
Legislative leaders once again want to address the financial sustainability of the state’s public pension system, which has a $26 billion unfunded actuarial liability.
They will also likely debate concerns over the massive changes to the system they passed into law last year, including creating a new system for new hires that will be a hybrid of a defined contribution plan, similar to the 401(k) system many private employers offer, and a defined benefit plan which the state has had for decades. Opponents of the new hybrid plan say its more austere benefits will make it hard for the state to hire and retain workers, particularly first responders and teachers.
First responders, through their associations of chiefs of police and firefighters, are calling on lawmakers to create a separate retirement plan for them.
Speaker White and the House leadership aim to establish a dedicated, recurring revenue stream for PERS, but Hosemann and his Senate leadership have favored a direct cash infusion to address the liability. 
Specifically, House leadership has favored diverting the bulk of the state’s lottery proceeds to PERS, or legalizing mobile sports betting and taxing a portion of the bets.

(Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Missouri’s largest state employee pension fund can’t recover losses from investments in Ontario-based capital funds, a Cole County judge ruled last month as he closed out a five-year court battle.
The Missouri State Employees Retirement System, or MOSERS, spent at least $21 million pursuing the case accusing Catalyst Capital Group Inc. of mismanaging $175 million entrusted to its care. In a Dec. 19 decision, Circuit Judge Daniel Green ruled MOSERS failed to prove its allegations of misconduct against Catalyst and ordered MOSERS to pay the defendants’ costs to contest the lawsuit.
The ruling comes as lawmakers return to the Capitol this week to start working on the state budget for the coming fiscal year. MOSERS is again asking for an increase in the pension contribution rate — to 32% of state payroll costs — as investment returns lag behind increases in promised benefits.
For fiscal 2027, which begins July 1, MOSERS is asking lawmakers for $864 million, including $533 million in general revenue. The total request is almost $330 million more than the state’s contribution for fiscal 2023.
The final ruling from Green came after several preliminary decisions pared the lawsuit down by dismissing several claims. One barred MOSERS from seeking damages on behalf of other investors because MOSERS had not attempted to make other investors, including the University of Missouri, parties to the lawsuit.
Chuck Hatfield, the attorney representing Catalyst, said the decision vindicated the investment group’s actions. MOSERS claimed losses linked to three funds created by Catalyst that have purchased companies like Cirque du Soleil and Canada-based Gateway Casinos were due to misconduct by fund managers.
“These funds all still own companies that are not sold yet,” Hatfield said. “When they do (sell), MOSERS is probably going to make a fair amount of money on that sale.”
MOSERS filed the lawsuit in 2020 when Catalyst called for the pension system to fulfill $10 million of its $100 million commitment to one of the three funds. 
In a statement to The Independent, MOSERS spokeswoman Candy Smith said Green’s order didn’t address the merits of the allegations.
“The judge’s rulings did not evaluate the actual misconduct at issue,” Smith wrote. 
The lawsuit outlined what MOSERS considered to be loans that were made to an insider at Catalyst that also put too much of the funds into a single entity. 
The system’s board of trustees will consider whether an appeal has a likelihood of success, Smith wrote.
MOSERS is the general pension system for state employees, covering workers in most state agencies and state universities. There are 56,494 retirees and their dependents currently receiving benefits and 44,673 active state employees, with another 17,943 vested and scheduled to receive a benefit at retirement age.
According to the latest annual report, MOSERS had $12.1 billion in cash and investments at the end of June, with net assets of $9.6 billion. At the end of June, it had enough money to cover 55.4% of current and future obligations. That is down from 59% in fiscal 2021, when the lawsuit was filed.
During arguments in court, attorneys for MOSERS said it invested $120 million of $175 million in commitments to Catalyst Funds III, IV and V, pledging to invest up to $50 million, $25 million and $100 million, respectively.
At a hearing in 2020, MOSERS said it lost $34 million from $50 million invested in Fund III, $18 million from $25 million invested in Fund IV, and $7.2 million of the $45 million invested to that point in Fund V.
In the investment section of the most recent annual report, the market value of the funds were listed as $11.2 million for Fund III, $6 million for Fund IV and $61.2 million for Fund V. The report does not state how much has been received as distributions from those funds.
One reason MOSERS saw several of its claims dismissed in early 2025 was because its attorneys did not bring other investors into the case as co-plaintiffs. Instead, MOSERS sought to assert the claims on their behalf — and recover the damages — without their participation.
“MOSERS argues that defendants engaged in rampant, potentially criminal misconduct for the better part of a decade, and that such conduct caused more than $1 billion in damages to these investment funds,” Green wrote in the January 2025 decision. “If that were true, it is reasonable to think that MOSERS could muster evidence that even one other investor (some of whom contributed hundreds of millions of dollars to the funds) shared MOSERS grievances.”
Green refused to issue an order at that point to bring other investors into the lawsuit.
“The judge said they were a day late and a dollar short,” Hatfield said. “Many of their claims were time-barred and they should have known long ago. And many of their claims were just wrong on the law.”
Through the end of June, MOSERS had paid $20.6 million for legal help, including $15 million to the law firm Quinn Emanuel, $3.6 million to  Thompson Coburn and $2 million for expert witnesses.
Changes in investment assumptions, not the payments to attorneys, are the reason MOSERS is falling behind in its actuarial evaluations, Smith said. The return on investments for fiscal 2025 was a strong 9.8%, she said.
The board “implemented positive changes to the funding policy, fully aware that these changes would cause a short-term decline in the funded ratio and an increase in the contribution rate,” Smith wrote, “but work toward the long-term goal of being fully funded.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/050523_Mosers2-1024x640.jpg,,,2026-01-06 07:11:40.876744

(Photo by Anne-Marie Caruso/New Jersey Monitor)LGBTQ advocates urged New Jersey lawmakers Monday to protect health care for the state’s transgender community, demanding action on stalled legislation at a midday rally outside the Statehouse in Trenton as federal threats mount.
A bill that would shield both patients and providers in New Jersey from criminal or civil liability for getting or giving health care related to gender dysphoria and gender incongruence has languished since it was introduced in June 2024. Almost half of the Legislature has signed on as sponsors, and the bill’s backers say it has enough other legislative support to pass.
The bill would codify protections Gov. Phil Murphy (D) outlined in a 2023 executive order.
“Everyone deserves health care without discrimination, and trans people are part of everyone. It’s just health care, legislators! It’s nothing to be afraid of!” said Melissa Firstenberg, a transgender woman from Marlton who emceed the rally.
Louise Walpin, an advocate who helped lead the fight to legalize same-sex marriage in New Jersey more than a decade ago, said lawmakers have failed to act despite a flood of constituent calls and emails supporting the legislation.
“This is not how a democracy works. This is a failure of government, and we will call it out,” Walpin said. “Delay is not neutrality. Delay is collaborating with hate. Delay is harm.”





















































































The delay is also “batsh*t crazy,” said one lawmaker who joined the rally to support the bill.
“If New Jersey wants to be a state that protects people instead of targeting them, if we are going to be choosing compassion and courage over cruelty, then this bill needs to pass and be enacted swiftly,” said bill sponsor Sen. Raj Mukherji (D-Hudson).
Rich McGrath, a spokesman for New Jersey’s Senate Democrats, said Senate President Nicholas Scutari had no comment on why the bill hasn’t moved. Spokespeople for Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin did not respond to a request for comment. Both men control what bills advance in their chamber.
Assemblyman John Burzichelli (D-Gloucester), a bill sponsor who also joined the rally to talk up the bill, conceded lawmakers have a rapidly shrinking window to get the bill to Murphy’s desk, with the next two-year legislative session set to begin on Jan. 13. But if they fail to act, he added, the bill will just be introduced again in the new session.
“We’re hoping to get it done. Speaking personally, I’d like to get it done this week. If not, the game goes on. We regroup very quickly,” he told the New Jersey Monitor.
It’s unclear if Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill (D) would support the legislation. Her spokespeople did not respond to a request for comment.
The legislative inaction comes as hospitals around New Jersey, following a national trend, have increasingly scaled back or abandoned altogether gender-affirming care, fearing federal funding cuts and other reprisals.
On his first day in office, President Donald Trump issued an executive order declaring his administration would recognize only two sexes. The Trump administration also issued a report critical of gender-affirming care, and threatened to withhold funding from hospitals that provide such care to youth.
Trump loomed large at Monday’s rally.
Tina Neal, who heads the transgender-supportive nonprofit Tertium Quid, said the Trump administration’s strategy of threatening to defund hospitals to force compliance is a “mafia tactic.”
“I don’t blame providers for making impossible choices under financial coercion. That’s exactly why this administration is doing it. But you know who has money? The state. You know who has the power to keep this care alive for those who need it? The state,” Neal said. “So New Jersey, we ask you: Are you going to stand up for your children?”
Other states, including Connecticut, New York, Maryland, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island, have passed similar shield laws, and outgoing New York City Mayor Eric Adams created a $2 million emergency fund last month to ensure access to such care, according to Andy Bowen, a former Garden State Equality executive director and the group’s first transgender leader.
New Jersey legislators should protect gender-affirming care because restricting it for transgender people is discriminatory, said Nathan Rodriguez, executive director of the Trans Equity Coalition. Cisgender people receive gender-affirming care every day already in the form of hormone treatment for menopause, breast reconstruction for cancer survivors, hair transplants, and testosterone for men with low hormones, Rodriguez said.
“That is gender-affirming care, and there’s no outrage, no legislation, and no moral panic,” he said. “If you are willing to let the government strip these rights from trans people, please ask yourself this: Who will be next? How far are you going to let them go before they are knocking on your door, deciding what care you are allowed to receive?”

According to our recent survey of officials in Michigan communities, local democracy is humming along and city hall is taking care of business.
The federal government was shut down in October and November 2025, but cities and towns around the United States continued to fill potholes, purify drinking water, respond to emergency calls and issue construction permits, mostly with little fanfare.
But Michiganders should not take this local resilience for granted. Officials – especially in rural communities – are also raising some red flags about declining public engagement, deteriorating public discourse and harassment.
 The view from city hall

At the University of Michigan’s Center for Local, State and Urban Policy, we have been surveying local officials in Michigan’s 1,856 cities, villages, counties and townships since 2009. About 70% of local governments in the state complete our survey each year, which means that our results reflect the opinions of everyone from township clerks in the Upper Peninsula to mayors of larger cities in the Metro Detroit area.
This Michigan Public Policy Survey has covered a wide variety of local issues over the years. One topic we track closely is how democracy is functioning in local communities.
While many public opinion surveys ask how Americans feel about democracy, very few examine the viewpoints of local officials whose job it is to carry out the daily work of democratic governance. For example, instead of asking whether people trust their government, we flip the question around and ask local officials whether they trust their residents to be responsible participants in policymaking.
 Democracy at its grassroots is strong

To get a high-level understanding of local democratic health, we ask Michigan local officials to rate the overall functioning of democracy in their communities on a scale of 1 to 10, from total breakdown to perfectly functioning.
Statewide, 82% reported a score of 7 or higher when we surveyed them in the spring of 2025. This percentage has remained remarkably steady since we first began tracking it in 2020.
At the other end of the scale, only 2% of communities this year rated democracy poorly – 4 or below – falling from a high of 7% in 2024.

 Small and rural communities are falling behind

While these high ratings are good news for local democracy in general, when we break down the results by whether communities consider themselves more urban or rural, we see some divergence. While 82% of communities overall reported relatively good democratic health this year, this reflects 92% of urban communities and 79% of rural communities.
We also see evidence of a growing urban/rural divide in resident engagement, an essential ingredient of democratic health. When we asked local officials how engaged their residents were with their local governments, 64% of urban communities said their residents were somewhat or very engaged, but only 41% of rural communities felt the same. In fact, 13% of rural communities said their residents are not engaged at all, compared with only 5% of urban communities.

Similarly, local officials in urban communities have higher levels of trust in their residents to be responsible participants in local policymaking – for example, by contributing ideas, volunteering or speaking with elected officials. In Michigan’s urban communities, 48% of local officials said they trust their residents nearly always or most of the time. However, only 38% of rural local officials had the same level of trust in their residents.
 The big picture looks less rosy

While rural communities currently appear to be struggling more than urban communities to engage with their residents, looking over time, democratic participation is getting worse everywhere. For example, 18% of Michigan communities statewide reported this year that civic discourse among residents was somewhat or very divisive, up from 11% in 2012.
Between 2012 and today, despite their efforts to expand engagement opportunities, particularly online, local officials’ satisfaction with their residents’ level of engagement has plummeted from 58% in 2012 to 38% in 2025. Among the most common frustrations are that their efforts attract the same people over and over and that a small vocal minority of residents is negatively affecting overall engagement.
Even more troubling, about half of local officials who responded to the 2022 version of our survey have experienced some kind of personal harassment, with 39% reporting in-person harassment such as hostile or aggressive comments, 31% reporting online harassment and 3% reporting violent actions like assault or destruction of property.
 Looking ahead

While only 17% of Americans currently trust the federal government to “do what is right” “just about always” or “most of the time,” according to a recent Pew survey, 65% of Americans still trust their local government. And as our survey results suggest, most local officials feel pretty confident that they’re being good stewards of local democracy, despite declining help and input from their residents.
To any Americans worried about the state of their democracy, may we suggest heading to the next meeting of the local planning commission? We hear there are sometimes even snacks.

(Photo by Paul Bradbury/Getty Images)OKLAHOMA CITY — A legislative measure that seeks to slap restrictions on where homeless shelters can operate across most of Oklahoma is a misguided effort that will cause more harm to an already marginalized community, some advocates say.
Critics of Senate Bill 484, which prevents new homeless shelters from being built within 3,000 feet of a school or school property, said while the legislation appears targeted at registered sex offenders, it would create unintended consequences for unhoused families. They said there are better solutions to address the issue.
Kori Hall, chief programs officer for City Care, an Oklahoma City service provider for homeless people, said lawmakers envision schools and churches as a place where children can access services, and they pass legislation restricting sex offenders from accessing those areas.
But Hall said this bill, which could be considered by the House when lawmakers reconvene in February, has the potential to harm those youth too because a lot of people experiencing homelessness and utilizing services and shelters are families with children.
“Children need to be able to have access to shelters and also to school,” she said. “So creating that distance barrier can kind of be a barrier for them to receive both of the services that they need.”
Hall said her organization is located less than a 0.5 miles from three different elementary schools, and they’ve never had an issue.
“Those schools partner with us because people staying in our shelter have kids who go to their schools,” she said. “It’s actually a benefit for them to have those families close because it makes sure that their kids can go to school and not have truancy.”
The bill would apply to every Oklahoma city with populations of less than 300,000. Only Oklahoma City and Tulsa have populations greater than that. Existing homeless, domestic violence and youth shelters and those operating within places of worship would be exempt.
According to the 2024 Annual Homelessness Assessment Report to Congress, a report compiled by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, 5,467 people experienced homelessness in Oklahoma in 2024, a 17.6% increase from the previous year. Of those, 1,060 were “people in families with children,” and 450 were “unaccompanied youth,” a term for minors who are not under the care of a parent or legal guardian.
State Sen. Lisa Standridge, R-Norman, who authored the measure did not respond to requests for comment, but in January 2025 said the bill is intended to address public safety.
“That’s a constituent bill from my town of Norman which is absolutely a Dumpster fire right now, and what they’ve done to allow the homeless to establish a vagrant nation, if you will … The public safety at Norman is at risk,” she said.
Standridge’s bill narrowly cleared the state Senate last year and is available to be considered by the House when lawmakers reconvene in February.
Norman Mayor Stephen Tyler Holman, whose city would be impacted by the legislation, said the measure seems “arbitrary, capricious, potentially discriminatory” in that it exempts Oklahoma City and Tulsa.
 “It obviously doesn’t really address or solve the issue of homelessness at all,” Holman said. “And it aims to take away the ability for local residents to decide for what we think is best for our own communities. (I am) hoping that we can work with Senator Standridge and other state representatives on ways to actually address the root causes of homelessness and why it’s such a big issue in the state of Oklahoma statewide.”
Cleveland County, where Norman is located, experienced an approximate 12.7% increase in the total number of homeless in 2024 compared to the previous year, according to a 2024 Point in Time Count, an annual census of people experiencing homelessness.
Holman said lawmakers could help his community by determining the future of the state mental hospital that is in Norman, as well as the future of the services it provides to the homeless population located in that area.
“And, if we can more adequately address the shortage of housing, we can prevent more people from becoming homeless, then the homeless issue is easier and less expensive to deal with, ideally,” he said.
He said it would also help if lawmakers also adequately funded mental health services.
Alissa Gilmore, program director and treasurer of the Micah Community Movement, an Oklahoma City-based homelessness service organization, said she doesn’t see any positives to Standridge’s bill.
She said systematic issues in society create homelessness.
Increased access to mental health and affordable drug addiction treatment would both be better solutions.
“Those are things that help to solve homelessness, not just move it around,” Gilmore said. “This kind of bill does nothing to solve homelessness. It basically just moves it around. It’s not an attempt to  make anything better.”

Mike Braun discusses Indiana public safety in an interview on Monday, Jan. 5, 2026, in his Statehouse office. (Photo by Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Gov. Mike Braun on Tuesday touted what his administration called major public safety gains in its first year, pointing to large drug seizures, stepped-up traffic enforcement and a sharp decline in overdose deaths as evidence that Indiana is “safer” under his watch.
In a news release, Braun credited the Indiana State Police with disrupting drug trafficking networks operating in and around the state and removing impaired drivers from Hoosier roads.
The governor said those outcomes are the clearest way he judges whether his administration’s public safety strategy is working.
“You look at statistics — overdose deaths, what we’re taking off the streets — that’s how you measure it,” Braun said in a sit-down interview with the Indiana Capital Chronicle on Monday. “Hopefully, you see big improvements at first, and then over time, you see it trend down and compare favorably to other states.”
‘Safer’ Indiana roads
Public safety was a central theme of Braun’s campaign and transition agenda, which emphasized tougher enforcement against violent crime and drug trafficking, stronger penalties for repeat offenders and closer coordination between state and local law enforcement agencies. 
The plan specifically singled out methamphetamine and fentanyl as major drivers of crime and overdose deaths in Indiana and posited that drug trafficking networks exploit gaps in border enforcement.
Indiana State Police roll out new fleet of Dodge Durangos, Ford Mustangs

“When you look at the consequences of open borders, many of us think every state, every county, every town pays the consequences of it,” Braun said.
“There was such an infrastructure built up with cartels basically having easy ways to enter, and that’s been disrupted” by federal efforts, he added, but every state “still has to do its own part.”
Since taking office, Braun has also highlighted traffic safety as a key component of that approach. The governor’s office said Tuesday that operating while intoxicated arrests increased 17% in 2025 — from 3,406 the year before to 3,985. Braun attributed the increase to ISP’s intensified enforcement efforts aimed at impaired driving.
Those arrests coincided with a decline in fatal crashes statewide. Indiana saw 737 fatal crashes in 2025, down from 804 the previous year, according to the governor’s office. Braun’s administration said the 8.3% decrease is the result of greater traffic enforcement by state police and local law enforcement.
Late last year, for example, the state police rolled out a new fleet of patrol vehicles as part of a broader push to modernize the agency’s roadway enforcement tools and increase visibility on Indiana’s highways.
ISP leadership said the updated fleet — which includes a handful of high-performance Ford Mustang GTs —  is intended to help troopers more effectively deter reckless driving, aggressive behavior and street racing.
“We’re paying more attention to it,” Braun said of impaired driving enforcement. “That OWI number went up because we’re ferreting it out. We’re finding it. If it increased by 17%, that tells you there were way too many people still out there driving while intoxicated.”
State police up drug seizures
ISP interdiction teams additionally seized hundreds of kilograms of illegal drugs in 2025, according to the governor’s office, including nearly 1,100 pounds of cocaine found in a U-Haul truck and more than 70 pounds of heroin recovered from a semi-truck. 
State police also confiscated roughly 70,000 THC vape cartridges, which officials said were unregulated products intended for illegal distribution.
Altogether, ISP reported seizing 630 kilograms of cocaine and 38 kilograms of opioids last year, which Braun’s administration described as a significant blow to cartel supply lines feeding Indiana communities.
The release said ISP detectives relied on advanced investigative tools, including wiretaps, to dismantle drug rings operating in small and midsize Hoosier communities, targeting “not only couriers, but the suppliers directing distribution into the state.”

As a result, opioid seizures increased by 117% in 2025, according to the governor’s office.
State officials further pointed to a reported 60% drop in overdose deaths statewide as the most consequential outcome of those efforts.
“Overdose deaths — that’s one of the biggest indicators,” Braun said. “A lot of what was coming across the border illicitly is not anymore, and when you’re taking millions of dollars of drugs off the street, that’s how you start to see those numbers change.”
And Braun’s team said drug interdiction efforts have continued into 2026. 
Over the weekend, ISP seized 140 kilograms of cocaine during a traffic stop — an estimated $7 million street value, according to the governor’s office.
Braun championed several public safety-related measures during the 2025 legislative session, including policies that increase penalty levels for crimes involving fentanyl and provided additional tools for prosecuting impaired driving and drug-related crimes.
Lawmakers returned to the Statehouse on Monday for the 2026 short session, which is scheduled to conclude by the end of February. Neither the House nor Senate Republican supermajority caucuses have released their priority agendas yet.
Braun isn’t expected to release his newest legislative priorities until next week. He admitted that state lawmakers “might already be worn out” from hectic work during last year’s budget-setting session and a legislative battle over redistricting in December, “but they’re going to have some good ideas” on public safety matters.
“A lot of what we did through executive orders is already being used as a template for legislation,” Braun said. “When something makes sense, you want to codify it. So, we’ll keep pointing that out.”

Wyoming's small towns struggle to maintain law enforcement services in the face of unstable funding, sparse populations and vast distances.
The post Policing in Medicine Bow went boom, then bust, reflecting statewide funding challenges appeared first on WyoFile .","During a recent Medicine Bow Town Council meeting, a local radio station owner asked if the town could cite a resident for a barking dog. The answer is no, Mayor Justin George explained, because no local ordinances can be enforced without a functioning marshal’s department.
Nestled in the northeastern corner of Carbon County, Medicine Bow is home to fewer than 250 people. Made famous by Owen Wister’s 1902 novel “The Virginian,” the small town today struggles with sustaining law and order in such a remote enclave.
In early 2024, the Medicine Bow Town Council voted to dissolve its local law enforcement, the town’s Marshal’s Office. Soon after, the council traded three unused patrol cars, three rifles and $55,000 to the Carbon County Sheriff’s Office in return for 360 hours of annual patrol time. Before the agreement was finalized, Sheriff Alex Bakken made it clear that his deputies could not enforce local ordinances. Instead, deputies would spend the contracted time in Medicine Bow responding to emergency calls and monitoring traffic on Highway 30.
Last summer, the contract came up for renewal. During their regular August meeting, Medicine Bow Town Council members publicly criticized the coverage the sheriff’s department provided, citing multiple alleged instances of deputies’ vehicles facing away from the highway as traffic passed through town without slowing down. Due to those allegations, and a lack of funding, the council unanimously voted not to continue the partnership, leaving the community without a law enforcement contract.
Sheriff Bakken did not respond to a request for comment prior to publication. 
Small-town justice
Between its founding in the late 1860s and 2019, Medicine Bow relied entirely on Carbon County to provide law enforcement. In 2019, flush with impact assistance funding from nearby wind projects such as the Ekola Flats wind farm, the Town Council voted to allocate $1 million to establish a Town Marshal’s Office. The plan was to maintain local law enforcement as long as possible using the impact money, while the marshal and his deputies supplemented the operating budget by writing citations.
But the experiment came to an abrupt end. In early 2024, with less than $400,000 left in the budget, the council decided to close the department and return law enforcement duties to the sheriff. Councilors said they had anticipated the funds would last longer than they ultimately did.

With the Medicine Bow Marshal’s Office now shuttered, the town was left with tens of thousands of dollars’ worth of equipment, including guns, ammunition and patrol vehicles. In July of 2025, the council voted to sell the weapons and equipment to a local firearms dealer. That’s when the council concluded that much of the money allocated to the marshals had been spent inefficiently.
In November 2025, Mayor Justin George ticked through an itemized list of leftover equipment from the closed office along with the cost to the town. As a whole, the governing body expressed disbelief at the amount of equipment purchased by the Medicine Bow Marshal’s Office during its five years of operation.
As an example of waste, the mayor reported that the department spent nearly $2,000 on 5,200 rounds of 9mm ammunition for mandatory firearms training. However, an inventory revealed that every bullet was present, indicating no training had occurred.
Additionally, the Marshal’s Office had purchased six $600 spike strips, three $200 combat-ready trauma bags with folding stretchers, three $120 bolt cutters, a $500 pair of Vortex-brand binoculars, and a black cowboy hat, valued at between $100 and $300.
“That was ridiculous, that stuff they had,” Councilwoman Kristi Wickizer said at the November meeting. “It was beyond ridiculous.”
Town policy allows department heads to spend up to $5,000 without prior approval from the council, the mayor said, adding that many of the questionable purchases fell just below the spending threshold.
Medicine Bow is set to recover $8,000 from the firearms sale, money that will be used to pay off outstanding debts from the marshal’s five-year stint, including a $17,000 Motorola radio service bill.
But two former mayors defended the marshal’s department, including its spending, and told WyoFile that they’re disappointed to see it disbanded.   
In 2022, voters elected Sharron Biamon, who was on the council when the marshal’s department was established, as mayor. She resigned the following year, and Councilor Lucy Schofield was appointed to replace her as mayor. Schofield resigned that summer.
While none of the elected officials responsible for the formation of the Medicine Bow Marshal’s Office are still on the council, both Biamon and Schofield said their councils fully supported how the department was run. Purchases had been approved and backed by the council, they said. They added that if the roughly $200,000 in annual ticket revenue had been reinvested into the Marshal’s Office, instead of going into the town’s general budget, the department would still be operating today.
The price of enforcing laws
Medicine Bow isn’t the only Wyoming town struggling to maintain a dedicated law enforcement agency. Twenty miles to the west, in the former coal-mining town of Hanna, local officials continue to wrestle with the cost of operating their own marshal’s office.
Hanna was once a major supplier of coal for the Union Pacific Railroad. After more than a century of mining, however, the seams became increasingly difficult to reach, and by the early 2000s the last coal company had shut down. During the height of the coal era, the town established the Hanna Marshal’s Office to police its few thousand residents. With the mines now closed, Hanna’s population has fallen to fewer than 700. Despite the decline, the town continues to maintain its own law enforcement operation, now staffed by only two part‑time marshals. The Hanna Town Council has repeatedly said it cannot afford to hire any full-time officers.
Many municipalities in Carbon County are turning to the Sheriff’s Office for the entirety of their law enforcement coverage. Like Medicine Bow once did, the towns of Riverside and Baggs signed memorandums of understanding, agreeing to pay the county to have deputies spend a set number of hours in each community. Carbon County commissioners have said towns that rely on the Sheriff’s Office for policing should help fund the department, especially in light of recent state property tax relief measures.
When Carbon County saw 2025 property tax revenue drop by more than $900,000, commissioners cut services across a county spanning nearly 8,000 square miles.
Providing legally required core services, such as water, sewer and law enforcement, is becoming increasingly expensive. In Saratoga, rising equipment costs have led the town, which still maintains its own police force, to cede emergency dispatching duties to the Carbon County Sheriff’s Office. Sheriff Alex Bakken has spent years studying if all dispatching services should be consolidated under his supervision, a prospect the Rawlins Police Department doesn’t fully support.
Even as counties and municipalities struggle to provide law enforcement coverage, state legislators are pursuing additional cuts to property taxes — a primary mechanism of funding county and local governments — including proposals to eliminate residential property taxes entirely. Sheriff Bakken has said that consolidating all emergency dispatching services under one roof is inevitable. Facing increased costs and decreased funding, some local officials wonder whether the same may eventually apply to law enforcement departments themselves. 
In the meantime, Medicine Bow residents must continue relying on the Sheriff’s Office, 40 miles away, for emergency response.

Barrasso and Lummis ""sanewash"" president's dangerous behavior in attack on Venezuela, columnist Kerry Drake opines. 
The post Wyoming’s dynamic Senate duo blindly follows Trump downhill appeared first on WyoFile .","Is there a lie that Donald Trump can tell to distract Americans from his incompetence that Wyoming’s U.S. Sens. John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis won’t stand up and applaud?

Opinion

I don’t think so, based on their response to Saturday’s reckless military strike against Venezuela. Trump’s administration didn’t even tell Congress it had invaded the country and captured President Nicolás Maduro and his wife until after the mission was completed.
Neither Barrasso nor Lummis questioned why the U.S. would attack a sovereign nation to force regime change that was certain to be condemned by dozens of other countries for breaking international laws, including China, Russia, most of Europe and Venezuela’s neighbors.
Whatever happened to Trump’s “America First” agenda that stoked his base in the last election? It sounds like he pushed it off the table to focus on his own dictatorship dreams.
The two senators didn’t say a word about how the move will destabilize the world and give bad actors like Russia an excuse to seize control of any country and its assets. 
Lummis went on social media to praise Trump’s “decisive leadership.” Both she and Barrasso branded Maduro a “narco-terrorist” — the GOP’s catch phrase of the day — and characterized his arrest as saving thousands of American lives.
Let’s be clear: Both senators were right when they called Maduro a dictator and said the world is safer with him out of power. But to contend that he posed an imminent threat to the U.S. and had to be forcibly removed without even consulting Congress just isn’t true, no matter how many stories Trump invents.
The Poynter Institute’s PolitiFact examined Trump’s justification for blowing up more than 30 boats off the coast of Venezuela since September, killing at least 115 people. It noted he never provided any evidence about what illegal drugs were supposedly on the ships or where they were headed. In one high-profile case, a second strike was ordered to kill two survivors who were clinging to wreckage to keep from drowning. 
If that’s not a war crime, what is?
At his post-invasion press conference, Trump claimed drugs on each boat would kill, “on average, 25,000 people.” If true, the mini-armada would have killed some 800,000 people, nearly 11 times as many drug overdose deaths as the U.S. reports annually.



But Trump gave himself credit for knocking “out 97% of the drugs coming in by sea.” In less than four months! Do you believe it? Of course not, but Barrasso and Lummis apparently have to if they don’t want to get knocked around on Truth Social.
In reality, experts in crime, drugs and Venezuela say the country plays a minor role in trafficking drugs that reach the U.S. compared to Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala and Mexico. But we aren’t toppling those nations’ leaders and rushing them to New York City for criminal trials.
Trump repeated his ridiculously false claim that Maduro emptied Venezuela’s mental institutions and prisons and sent them all to the U.S. “They were drug dealers. They were drug kingpins. They sent everybody bad into the United States, but no longer,” he said. “And we now have a border where nobody gets through.”
Then the president told us the real reason he invaded Venezuela. The South American nation, he said, “unilaterally seized and sold American oil, American assets, and American platforms costing us billions and billions of dollars.” Trump is pissed off, and he wants his revenge.
“Massive oil infrastructure was taken like we were babies, so we didn’t do anything about it,” Trump said. “I would have done something about it. America will never allow foreign powers to rob our people or drive us back into and out of our own hemisphere.”
I never expected the truth to suddenly burst from Trump’s lips, but he spelled out how he intends to help his billionaire oil buddies clean up. He said — again without evidence — that our country’s role in governing Venezuela “won’t cost us anything” because U.S. oil companies will invest in new infrastructure.
“It’s going to make a lot of money,” the president added, though many Americans would probably come to that conclusion on their own.
I think Wyoming voters still wearing blinders when it comes to Trump’s huge credibility problems, should ask themselves what’s more plausible: Is he actually kicking ass and fixing our national drug problems by taking over another country in total upheaval, or is Trump trying to make us forget all those phony promises to lower prices and turn the economy around?
There are myriad reasons why starting an illegal war probably seemed like a great option for Trump, who certainly won’t view it as a moral issue as long as people give him proper credit for doing it. 
His first year back in the White House must have been a miserable experience, except when he demolished the East Wing to build a garish $300 million ballroom, or added his name to the John F. Kennedy Center for the Arts, or got his kicks ridiculing a famous Hollywood couple who’d just been stabbed to death.
The national media is finally focusing attention on Trump’s rapid physical and mental decline, though not nearly as much as it did by being complicit and railroading Joe Biden out of office.
Then there’s that pesky scandal about Trump’s dead pedophile pal, Jeffrey Epstein, and the treasure trove of documents yet to be released about the infamous crimes. It’s even driven a wedge between the president and some of his most previously loyal MAGA followers, like U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene. Who could have seen that coming?
There won’t be any splits like that from the Wyoming delegation. Barrasso can’t keep his position as the No. 2 Senate Republican without Trump’s backing. Lummis is leaving the Capitol at the end of her term next year, but she won’t rock the boat. And her likely successor, Rep. Harriet Hageman, was strangely silent about the Venezuelan attack over the weekend, but she owes her political career to the president. 
If Secretary of State Chuck Gray continues his unlikely climb up the state’s political ladder and lands Hageman’s U.S. House seat, he’ll remain a loyal lapdog.
It would be great to see a Wyoming candidate who would dare question why Trump bypassed Congress. Even his chief of staff, Susan Wiles, told Vanity Fair that Trump would need a green light from Congress to approve land strikes in Venezuela.
A president can use military force as commander in chief, but only Congress can constitutionally declare war or fund one. If Trump used this mission just to take the heat off himself for the moment, I can see him simply declaring victory and looking for the next big magic trick to avoid accountability. 
But will any Wyoming Republican politician ever be held responsible for allowing Trump’s madness to be “sanewashed?”

(Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)Five years ago today we were transfixed by the surreal spectacle of the attack on the U.S. Capitol. The violence and horror of that day was made more bearable when the insurrectionists were arrested and the election results they tried to overturn were certified.
But now they’re back, pardoned by President Donald Trump and released from prison and planning to parade triumphantly today through the streets of Washington, D.C. 
Among the people convicted and later pardoned by Trump, at least 33 have been arrested and charged with new crimes, according to the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. Their alleged continuing criminal behaviors include rape, illegal possession of weapons, firing on police officers, and, in the case of Chrisopher Moynihan, threatening to murder House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. 
Some of the most violent offenders are back behind bars. But the most powerful proponents of the Big Lie, including Trump himself, the enablers who staff his administration and the Wisconsin Republicans who hatched the fake electors scheme to try to overturn the results of the 2020 election, continue to work to undermine our democracy. 
“We must continue to defeat election deniers and the threats they pose,” the Wisconsin-based progressive firm Law Forward declares on its website, in a section devoted to a timeline of the fake electors scheme. Law Forward brought the first class-action lawsuit against Wisconsin’s fake electors, and forced the release of documents, text messages and other evidence showing how the plot unfolded. They present the timeline “as a call to action for every American to see how close our democracy came to toppling and how the freedom to vote must continue to be protected, not taken for granted.” 
For a few years it seemed as though we had dispelled the nightmare of Jan. 6. But the lawless, emboldened second Trump administration has dragged us back to that scary, dangerous time.
The brave work of people like Jeff Mandell, founder of Law Forward, and the other lawyers, judges and investigators who continue to struggle against the agents of authoritarianism trying to destroy American democracy is still making a difference. 
Last month, Dane County Judge John Hyland found probable cause to continue the trial of Wisconsin attorney James Troupis and Trump campaign aide Mike Roman, charged with felony forgery by Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul in connection with the fake electors scheme. Hyland  rejected Troupis’ desperate effort to scuttle the case by claiming another judge had a personal bias against him.
Wisconsin attorney Ken Cheseboro, the originator of the fake electors plot, is also facing felony charges.
As Trump and his gang openly defy the U.S. Constitution, pursue baseless, vindictive prosecutions of their political enemies, launch military actions without the consent of Congress, threaten to seize other countries and use their positions to enrich themselves while destroying the public welfare, it feels as through that dark moment on Jan. 6 when American democracy was under physical attack was just the beginning.
But as Mandell told me last year, a few months after Trump took office, “I think building a stronger, more resilient democracy in Wisconsin is its own form of resistance.”
“When things feel most shocking and unstable at the federal level,” at the state and local level, Mandell said, “we can show our institutions still work and provide some reassurance.” 
We need that reassurance today more than ever.
“We are slow to realize that democracy is a life and involves continual struggle,” said Robert M. La Follette, the great governor and senator from Wisconsin and founder of the Progressive movement. I’m grateful for the Wisconsinites today who, like La Follette, are committed to that life and willing to continue the struggle.

(Photo: Getty Images)Despite the urging of county mayors, child advocates, clergy and educators, Gov. Bill Lee has declined to secure millions of dollars in federal funding to provide food to low-income kids by the government’s Jan. 1 deadline.
Lee has remained quiet about the apparent decision to forgo approximately $84 million from the federal government’s Summer EBT program, also known as SUN Bucks. In the past, the federal funding has helped feed 700,000 Tennessee kids during summer months when school is out. The governor’s office, for weeks, has not responded to reporters’ questions about whether he planned to participate in the federal Summer EBT.
On Monday, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed that “Tennessee has not submitted their intent to participate in Summer EBT for 2026.” 
Gov. Bill Lee stays mum as a deadline looms to opt into a summer food program for kids

Lee rejected the funding last year, too, aligning with more than a dozen Republican governors who cited reasons ranging from opposition to “attempts to expand the welfare state” to administrative costs. In 2025 Tennessee spent $5 million to administer the federal program. 
In its place, the governor established a Summer Nutrition Initiative operating in 15 counties, providing 18,000 kids the same per-child funding as the federal program: $120 for each child. In total, the state spent $3 million on the program.
Hundreds of thousands of children in Tennessee’s other 80 counties, including the state’s urban centers in Shelby and Davidson, weren’t eligible.
It remains unknown whether Lee intends to reintroduce the state-funded Summer Nutrition Initiative again this year. Lee’s office did not respond to questions Monday.
Tennessee launches its summer food benefits this week. Most students in the state will miss out.

In the weeks leading up to the January 1 deadline set by the federal government for states opting into the Summer EBT program, Tennessee lawmakers, faith leaders and county mayors have publicly urged Lee to take advantage of federal dollars, noting high levels of food insecurity among children in Tennessee. 
The funding, made available in the form of debit cards to use while food shopping, impacts more than just hungry children, they noted. 
Before Lee rejected the funding, the Food Research & Action Center estimated the federal funding flowing into Tennessee had a $115 million positive economic impact on the state, a result of virtually all funding spent on buying food in Tennessee grocery stores, farmers markets and convenience stores.

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)There is, of course, nothing new about the spectacle of everyday people being forced to endure great suffering because of the whims, foibles, fears and egos of powerful rulers and politicians. From the forced labor that helped construct the pyramids to the countless wars waged to boost a leader’s domestic political standing, millions of people throughout history have suffered greatly because of a powerful man’s – and it’s almost always been a man’s – desire for power.
We Americans sometimes like to think that our country has advanced beyond the kind of crude politics in which a leader issues edicts that sentence innocent people to pain and even death based on a personal desire for wealth, glory and power (or even just their mood on a particular day), but as President Donald Trump has made clear on numerous occasions, it has not.
And today, here in North Carolina, we are experiencing this phenomenon at the state level in the maddening actions and inactions of the state’s Republican legislative leadership – and in particular, one especially powerful leader, state Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger.
Berger, as you may or may not recall (and if you don’t it’s understandable, because it’s been a very long time), was elected to the Senate a quarter-century ago and has presided over the chamber for 15 years. Like a lot of other Republicans who entered politics around the turn of the century, Berger was elected during a time in which the North Carolina GOP was, rather ironically as it turns out, championing term limits for lawmakers and regularly decrying then-Senate President Pro Tem Marc Basnight’s long tenure in office. Basnight led the Senate through nine two-year sessions – a number that Berger clearly aspires to match or exceed. 
Basnight ultimately lost his Senate presidency when Democrats lost their Senate majority in the 2010 elections, but for Berger, the threat to his position comes not from the opposing party, but from within his own. 
Thanks to aggressive GOP gerrymandering, Republicans have almost no chance of losing their state Senate or House majorities anytime soon – even if Democrats win far more votes in legislative elections. But an interesting side effect of that gerrymandering is the way it has emboldened far-right candidates in GOP primaries to seek to outdo incumbents in demonstrating their slavish allegiance to Trumpism.
Hence, the current remarkable situation in Senate District 26, in which Berger, a hard right Republican who has adhered diligently to the Tea Party/MAGA line throughout his time in office, is nonetheless being challenged in the upcoming March primary by Rockingham County Sheriff Sam Page. From all indications, it appears to be a credible challenge by a man who has long been a Trump backer and campaign chair and who has won national attention as a loud promoter of anti-immigration policies.   
And that brings us to the crazy and deeply harmful situation that this primary electoral battle in a mostly rural state Senate district – a race that could be decided by a few thousand (or hundred) votes — is inflicting on millions of average North Carolinians. 
Because Berger is clearly determined to cling to power, he has chosen not to allow the Senate to take any actions that might provide fuel to Page – even if he knows deep down from years of experience in Raleigh that doing so will harm the state’s residents. 
And so it is that as the New Year dawns, six full months into the 2026 state fiscal year, North Carolina is the only state in the nation not to have enacted a budget. The central issue: taxes and tax cuts. 
As fiscal analysts have repeatedly noted, now is not the time for North Carolina to plunge ahead with another round of income tax cuts benefiting the wealthy and profitable corporations. Overall public investments are already down effectively by more than a third since the GOP gained power 15 years ago, and the state is failing miserably to meet its basic obligations in numerous core areas of governmental service like schools, health care and fighting hunger. 
The new cuts that took effect January 1 will make this situation much worse. Even Republican leaders in the state House acknowledged the need to at least slow the tax cut rush in the budget proposals they crafted last summer.
Unfortunately, Berger has determined that such a pause would, if enacted, provide red meat for the Page challenge. 
The result: scheduled tax cuts are now in place and the funding shortages that are starving our schools, keeping thousands of children malnourished, and precipitating scores of preventable deaths among people who’ve lost their health care coverage will continue to metastasize.
Will things go on like this? One fantasizes that after the primary Berger might somehow relent and allow common sense policy to prevail.
If Basnight’s 18-year record remains the goal, however, that seems like a longshot. And as has been the case with Trump and so many other power-obsessed leaders throughout history, average North Carolinians will continue to pay the price for Berger’s ambition.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_3951-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-06 06:12:16.094844

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)In the wake of the insurrection at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, President Donald Trump quickly took up the cause of a 35-year-old veteran named Ashli Babbitt.
“Who killed Ashli Babbitt?” he asked in a one-sentence statement on July 1, 2021.
“An innocent, wonderful, incredible woman, a military woman,” Trump said during a Fox News interview a few weeks later.

This report was originally published by The 19th. The Illuminator is a founding member of the 19th News Network.

To Trump and his Make America Great Again movement, Babbitt was not an insurrectionist shot while trying to get close to the members of Congress who were certifying the election results, the sole rioter killed by police that day. She was a martyr, someone who died for her beliefs. She was a woman who had died for lack of protection.
Trump’s framing of Babbitt’s death in the months after he left office served as one of the guiding principles of his second term: the necessity of “protecting women” and an insistence on identifying and eradicating those he sees as posing a threat to them.
Who was Ashli Babbitt?
She was an Air Force veteran who had done tours in Afghanistan and Iraq. She was married and divorced and then married again. She faced criminal charges after an altercation with an ex-girlfriend of her second husband. She voted for Barack Obama. She bought a pool care business with her husband. She discovered the far-right conspiracy theory QAnon, which asserted that Trump was trying to save the country from a cabal of Satan-worshipping child molesters installed within the United States government.
Over time, Babbitt became increasingly steeped in QAnon and was primed to believe the robustly disproved conspiracy that the 2020 election had been stolen from Trump. So when Trump encouraged his followers to go to Washington to support him on January 6, 2021, she did. While the election results were being officially certified by Congress, Trump addressed a crowd that included Babbitt. And when he encouraged them to go to the Capitol, many did — Babbitt among them.
Not everyone who went to the Capitol broke into the building, but she did. With a Trump flag draped over her shoulders like a superhero’s cape, Babbitt was part of the group who tried to gain access to the Speaker’s Lobby, just outside the House chamber. Another rioter smashed glass. As Babbitt tried to crawl through, a Capitol Police officer shot her from inside the lobby.
Video footage from the day shows Babbitt falling backward into the crowd as blood pours out of her mouth. After the shooting, many rioters began to flee the Capitol grounds. Babbitt was transported to Washington Hospital Center. She was declared dead upon arrival. 

The officer who killed Babbitt was cleared of wrongdoing; Lt. Michael Byrd potentially saved lives by stopping the mob, lawmakers and police said.
But her death gave Trump’s Make America Great Again movement something it needed: a martyr.
Religiosity moves in
A religious frame has been present in Trump’s politics since his rallies in the leadup to the 2016 election.
Jeffrey Sharlet, a veteran journalist and professor at Dartmouth College who was an early chronicler of the rise of Trumpism and its ties to religiosity, said these rallies were shaped by the prosperity gospel, a branch of Protestantism rooted in the supposition that, effectively, God wants you to be rich.
In 2020, the religious tenor was still there — but it had shifted to a more conspiratorial approach. Trump stopped merely “winking at QAnon” and began “invoking that level of conspiratorial thinking that has been absorbed into the DNA of the movement,” Sharlet said.
Before Babbitt’s death, Sharlet said, Trump had already been working to incorporate martyrs into his rhetoric, invoking a list of names, usually people who had been killed by immigrants in the country without legal status. They would typically fall into two categories, he said: “blonde white women and promising young Black men” — think Jamiel Shaw Jr., a rising football star in the midst of college applications who was shot and killed by a gang member who was in the country illegally, orSarah Root, who was killed by an undocumented drunk driver the day after her graduation from college.
Sharlet calls Babbitt “a perfect storm”: a White woman killed on camera in footage seen by millions, a Black man —  the Capitol police officer — responsible for her death.
“That changed everything,” Sharlet said. “The first real martyr who really takes hold of Trumpism is a woman, and it gives the movement a real religiosity.”
And it set the stage for Trump to ascend into a kind of religious figure himself after a would-be assassin shot him in Butler, Pennsylvania, in July 2024.
“Every martyr disappears into the cult of personality,” Sharlet said. “She was a placeholder. She keeps the cross warm until Trump gets up there and he’s the martyr. Now, he’s the martyr for us all — but it started with a certain appeal to women.”
Martyrs can’t speak
Babbitt was an active participant in the insurrection — but that didn’t mean she couldn’t be reassigned the role of someone who needed protecting.
Sharlet recalled watching videos of Trump supporters talking about Babbitt in the wake of her death: “They’re aging her backward, they’re lowering her weight, they’re lowering her height, they’re turning her into a little girl.”
It was a blueprint for what was to come, he said of Babbitt: “The blondeness is important, the smallness is important, but so is the camouflage of being a veteran.”
Her race, too, was important, Sharlet said.
“It’s about the Whiteness of things. It’s not enough for them that a woman be murdered,” he said. “She has to be a little girl. She has to be White.”
Meghan Tschanz, a former missionary who has emerged as a critic of patriarchal systems in evangelical Christianity, drew a connection between Babbitt and Laken Riley, a college student whose murder by an immigrant who was in the country illegally was highlighted by Trump. Both women’s deaths became part of a larger narrative — one designed to accomplish a political goal, not mourn the victims.
Tschanz, who lives in Athens, Georgia — where Riley was killed — stressed that criticizing the politicization of Riley’s death is in no way a dismissal of the reality and severity of her killing. Rather, she said, politicization can dilute the pain of the loss in service to a larger narrative.
“Again and again, we see women die and the response isn’t, ‘Let’s make it so women don’t die.’ It’s, ‘Let’s make it so that I can use this to further my narrative that immigrants are evil,’” she said.
Riley’s father, Jason Riley — a Trump supporter — told NBC News about the pain of watching his daughter become a political tagline after Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, at the time a strong Trump ally, heckled President Joe Biden during his State of the Union speech in 2024, urging him to say Riley’s name.
“I think it’s being used politically to get those votes. It makes me angry. I feel like, you know, they’re just using my daughter’s name for that. And she was much better than that, and she should be raised up for the person that she is,” Jason Riley said. “She was an angel.”
It’s a dynamic also echoed in Babbitt’s death. Though Babbitt’s mother, Michelle Witthoeft, emerged as a leading advocate for the release of those who were arrested for their actions on January 6, she also has publicly grappled with the way in which her daughter’s death became something other than an acute family tragedy.
Witthoeft told The Washington Post in 2021, “Half the country loves her and half the country hates her,” she said. “It’s weird to have your child belong to the world.”
For Trump, Riley’s and Babbitt’s  deaths helped reinforce the message that women’s lives are in danger and that they need to be saved — something he emphasized in his campaigns as he painted immigrants and his political opponents as threats.
“It all plays into the fears and vulnerabilities that women have to navigate, which is that women are more vulnerable to sexual and gender-based violence and women are tasked culturally with caring for the home and for their children,” said Hilary Matfess, an assistant professor at the University of Denver and the co-author of an analysis done by the Program on Extremism at George Washington University on gender and the January 6 insurrection. “So this message of scary immigrants are going to come in and destroy your communities with drugs and rape your women and children is intended to strike fear into a very specific demographic — namely, suburban White women.”
Matfess pointed to how the role of martyr cemented a view of Babbitt for Trump’s followers. She became someone who needed protecting, a figure whose memory is in need of constant, everlasting protection.
“Being put on a pedestal means you can’t move around too much,” Matfess said.
The ‘protection racket’
Matfess said there is a long-standing academic notion of the “protection racket,” in which a government offers protection from an imagined threat to deflect from the threat posed by the government itself. It’s something that can be used to keep women in subservient roles — and thus effectively in need of some form of protection from others.
“The Trump administration is not saying, ‘Wow, we should really expand access to prenatal health care’ or ‘We need more resources for women that are victims of domestic violence,’ because it is not about protecting women,” she said. “It’s about protecting certain men’s ability to wield power and influence under the banner of protection.”
Babbitt’s death in some ways challenged the narrative, too — she was part of the group trying to stop the certification of the election, not sitting by.
Matfess noted the ways that the Proud Boys — the far-right, all-men neo-fascist group that have become rigorous defenders of Trump and his agenda — insist on the fact that there are in fact no Proud Girls, often suggesting that the best way women can support the politics they espouse is by staying home and reproducing.
Matfess points to early rumors from within the far right that Babbitt was part of a false flag mission — evidence that the movement had to grapple with a woman who was attacking, not asking for protection.
“There’s a lot of utility to narratives that talk of attacks against women and children, and so it becomes that once they decided it wasn’t a false flag, that she was there of her own political beliefs, it becomes a compelling narrative of a woman sacrificing herself for this movement. Whether or not the movement would have been kind to her had she lived is besides the point,” Matfess said.
“The memorialization takes away the kind of difficult questions of how this movement would deal with women who are taking on more transgressive gender roles. Once someone’s a hero, you can leave it at that.”

Sean Cleary, R-Bismarck, speaks on the Senate floor on March 19, 2025. He has asked for an attorney general's opinion on the scope of authority for the State Investment Board. (Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)Two North Dakota lawmakers have asked Attorney General Drew Wrigley to formally weigh in on whether the State Investment Board has the authority to offer bonuses to staff responsible for managing the Legacy Fund. 
Sen. Sean Cleary, R-Bismarck, and Rep. Mitch Ostlie, R-Jamestown, requested the opinion as the board considers $1.3 million in proposed bonuses for 12 employees of the Retirement and Investment Office. 
“This is a fairly new program and a unique one,” Cleary said of the bonuses to state employees. “A formal opinion by the attorney general could just provide clarity for everyone, for myself, for the State Investment Board, for RIO.”
Wrigley said he couldn’t comment on the specifics of the request because his office is actively working on the legal opinion.
“I’m prioritizing the matter and I expect to be able to publish my attorney general opinion on that in the relative near term,” the attorney general said Monday. 
The incentive program was approved by legislators in 2023 and implemented in 2024 by the State Investment Board, which oversees the Retirement and Investment Office. This would be the first time bonuses would be awarded under the program.
The incentive pay is based on the performance of the state’s investment funds compared to earnings benchmarks that represent standard market performance. But the approval of the bonuses was tabled at the November meeting of the State Investment Board because of questions about whether the board has the legal authority to do so without a specific legislative appropriation. 
The Attorney General’s Office later verbally advised that the agency could safely proceed with the approval of the bonuses, Retirement and Investment Office Executive Director Jodi Smith said during a December meeting. 
The bonuses are expected to be on the agenda for the State Investment Board’s Jan. 16 meeting. Cleary said “it would be prudent” for the board to delay that decision until the extent of its authority to award the bonuses is clarified by the attorney general. 
“There was ambiguity in how the law was interpreted and discussed across multiple meetings. When public dollars are involved, the responsible step is to get clarity in writing so taxpayers have certainty, not confusion, about how their money is spent,” Cleary said.
North Dakota investment board delays action on $1.3 million in employee bonuses

Seven of the 12 proposed bonuses exceed $100,000 and the largest is $293,000, for the chief investment officer. The agency created the program to encourage investment managers and other staff to focus on bringing in more money for the state, as well as to improve staff recruitment and retention. 
The four largest funds managed by the State Investment Board are the Legacy Fund, the Public Employees Retirement System, the Teachers Fund for Retirement and Workforce Safety and Insurance.
Those funds outperformed benchmarks by $191 million between July 1, 2024, and June 30, 2025. 
A spokesperson for the Retirement and Investment Office declined to comment at this time, noting any action on the issue must be approved by the full State Investment Board. 
Gov. Kelly Armstrong, who chairs the board, declined to comment through a spokesperson, who said he anticipates the topic will be on the Jan. 16 agenda. The governor has previously expressed reservations about the proposed bonuses. 
The State Investment Board is composed of the governor, legislative leaders and other state officials.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)A former House staffer — pardoned for a federal corruption conviction — is asking to delay a hearing before the state’s campaign finance watchdog to testify about a political action committee he formed secretly in 2020 to affect the election.
The move is drawing opposition from at least one key member of the Registry of Election Finance.
An attorney for Cade Cothren, ex-chief of staff for former House Speaker Glen Casada, requested that a January hearing before the Tennessee Registry of Election Finance be postponed to allow more time to prepare. The Registry board voted in November 2025 to drop a subpoena against Cothren and, instead, order him to explain the formation of the Faith Family Freedom Fund, a PAC that worked to defeat a Casada nemesis, Republican Rep. Rick Tillis of Lewisburg, in 2020.
Cothren’s attorney, Cynthia Sherwood, notified the Registry that because of the holidays and changing legal issues related to the subpoena, she needs extra time to work on the case. In a Dec. 30 email, she also asked for a one-week continuance from Jan. 2 to turn in sworn documents.
Registry staff attorney Seth May told Sherwood that neither he nor Executive Director Bill Young have the authority to delay items on the board’s agenda and that the request would be scheduled for consideration when the board meets Jan. 22, according to email documents obtained by the Lookout.
May added a note of caution, saying, “Just for purposes of your preparation, it is my instinct that the Registry will not grant a continuance.”
Tennessee campaign finance agency seeks probe of secret PAC

Registry member Tom Lawless, a Nashville attorney who will chair the meeting, said there is “absolutely no reason why this matter cannot proceed at this time.” 
“There has been sufficient time and energy put into this matter, and I cannot foresee how continuing it would necessarily benefit the public and provide the transparency that is so incumbent upon what we do in the Registry,” Lawless said.  
In addition, asked which statutes Cothren allegedly violated, May told Sherwood that state law requires a political campaign committee to accurately certify the name and address of its political treasurer.
“The Registry’s concern is that the treasurer listed on the committee’s filing was not correct, and that in fact Mr. Cothren was acting as treasurer for the committee,” May wrote.
An immediate decision by the board could muddy Cothren’s potential political rebound after he resigned from his post amid a racist and sexist texting scandal that also led to Casada’s departure in 2019.
Since receiving a pardon from President Donald Trump late last year, Cothren has made overtures toward a state House bid for the District 71 seat held by Republican Rep. Kip Capley that takes in Lawrence, Hardin, Maury and Wayne counties. If Cothren refuses to pay any civil penalty levied against him by the Registry board, he would be ineligible to run for state office.
The state House qualifying deadline is March 10, which likely falls before the Registry board’s next regularly-scheduled  meeting.
The Registry board subpoenaed Cothren in 2022 after a former girlfriend, Sydney Friedopfer, testified he asked her to form the political action committee, listing herself as treasurer, so he could run it secretly. She also said in telephone testimony that Cothren told her she didn’t need to worry about responding to questions from the Registry.
Cothren refused to comply with the board’s subpoena and never appeared before the Registry, invoking his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. The Registry board sent the matter to the Attorney General’s office, which took it to Chancery Court to be enforced. It remained there until Cothren’s federal corruption case wrapped up with a presidential pardon following a conviction on multiple charges involving a bogus campaign vendor.
The Registry board also asked the Williamson County District Attorney’s Office to investigate the matter, and that was put on hold until Cothren’s federal case wrapped up.
The Faith Family Freedom Fund spent money donated in the 2020 campaign by a North Carolina restaurateur, whom the Registry was unable to locate, to pay for campaign ads attacking Tillis, a political enemy of Casada’s. Rep. Todd Warner of Lewisburg, who enlisted Cothren for political work, defeated Tillis that year, and two months later the FBI raided the offices and homes of Warner, Casada, Cothren and former Rep. Robin Smith of Hixson. Smith, whose sentence was changed to one year of probation house before was slated to check into federal prison on Monday, continues to seek a pardon after pleading guilty and cooperating with federal prosecutors in their case against Cothren and Casada.
The Registry board initially audited the Faith Family Freedom Fund PAC because of a complaint filed by Greg Hazelwood, the treasurer for Tillis, who claimed the political action committee illegally coordinated with Warner’s campaign. Auditors were stonewalled but finally found Friedopfer, who registered the PAC, in Utah.

Brad Little gives his annual State of the State address on Jan. 6, 2025, on the House floor at the Statehouse in Boise. (Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)The Idaho Legislature and our governor have noted the influx of disenfranchised Californians moving into our state. They have heard the boom of the economic growth. And they have asked, as Dorothy did, “Is this Kansas?” And they have said “Yes Dorothy, we are in Kansas.”
The Idaho Legislature and our governor have cut taxes so much we now face a budget deficit while our population grows. I know Gov. Brad Little thought this was unwise, but he signed it. Our Republican Legislature voted for this whole hog. We will pay. Our population increases and our state funding declines.
Idaho’s projected budget deficit estimated at $40 million heading into 2026 legislative session

Kansas did this. In 2012, the Kansas Legislature and Gov. Sam Brownback passed huge income tax cuts. The supply side people cheered. Grover Norquist, the pseudo economist who argued he wanted government to be so small he could drown it in a bathtub, was in ecstasy. The Koch Brothers, Texas billionaires who pull Idaho state legislators’ strings, grinned. The Kansas model would prove all their points.
But it didn’t.
Cutting taxes does not make an economy boom. It didn’t for Kansas. They depleted their reserves and struggled to fund schools. Idaho has this on the horizon.
Especially when tax cuts just benefit the wealthy and corporations. Us pogues drive the consumer economy, and we have not gotten these Idaho gifts. We are hurting. But our schools and our roads and our lives will suffer.
So how did the Kansas Experiment work out? Not so great.
Kansas is almost as Republican as Idaho, but Gov. Brownback ended up leaving the state to serve as “Ambassador at Large for Religious Freedom.” A Democrat succeeded him in the governor’s mansion in Topeka.
Idaho would never do that. And we don’t have a governor’s mansion.
I doubt Brad has international ambassadorial dreams.
He loves Idaho. And he knew these tax cuts were stupid. He said so. But he signed them.
Idaho has seen growth. People love the Treasure Valley. Do they need schools and roads? Maybe they are over 60 and just want a small ranchette. At least they have escaped the liberals in California.
Is this the Idaho Brad Little said he wanted?
No.
He said he wanted this to be a state where the kids born here would find good jobs and want to raise their  families. I can’t think of a higher aspiration. Three of my four daughters are Idaho taxpayers. I love this state too. It’s why this Idaho Democrat voted for him.
I realize such an endorsement might not be welcome. That’s his problem.
But then he signed the ruby slippers tax cuts. And he’s holding back money to balance the budget. That’s his job. But he did sign the bills. We will dip into reserves, so the pain isn’t felt this year, but it’s coming. The budget will be balanced. And we will feel it.
Brad knows state finances better than anyone. And he can see the coming crash. But he signed the bills.
The problem is the Idaho Legislature, who we elect from these bizarre districts. Our legislators write these laws.
But then Brad signs them.
We, the voters, need to be seeing this issue. Please study Kansas. They did the experiment. Why do we need to redo it here?
Maybe the problem isn’t with Brad or those clowns in the Capitol. It’s with us. We don’t learn.
Maybe we don’t care about Kansas.
Maybe we’ll just have to learn this lesson here in our beloved state.
We deserve the representation we vote for. And they, no we have brought this upon us. When it comes, look in the mirror and think what you/we could have done different.
For the twister comes.

(Photo of Blue Ridge mountains by Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)In June, North Carolina launched its long-awaited program to rebuild single-family homes damaged by Hurricane Helene in western North Carolina.
For state officials, it represented the most expansive, highest-stakes slice of an unprecedented hurricane recovery effort. The single-family program, funded with more than $800 million in federal grant money, would take years to complete. And it would be forced to follow a troubled homebuilding operation in the eastern part of the state, wracked by accounting woes and bureaucratic slog.
Six months later, the state now has a grip on the scale of that program as it prepares to close applications: more than 5,000 eligible submissions. A separate program, launched in mid-December, will rebuild small rental projects. Later in 2026, large rentals and workforce housing projects will be eligible for rebuilds.
Eager to distinguish themselves from a long-struggling recovery effort in the east, the state hustled to launch this program — “faster than we’ve ever done it in this state and faster than any state, for any storm, in ten years,” Commerce Secretary Lee Lilley said in an interview.
“We’ve got a big chunk of folks who are ready to go,” Lilley said of applicants in the single-family housing program. “I think in 2026, we’ll see a pretty significant increase in our pace in putting people through construction and closeout.”
The state in mid-December extended applications for the program through the end of January. Meanwhile, officials keep closely watching the numbers on tourism — the lifeblood of many western communities. And they continue to push FEMA and the federal government for more aid, amid increased frustrations with months-long delays.



A six-month sprint to get homeowners signed up
Applications were slow in the opening weeks of the program, as households first learned about its requirements and details. By Aug. 11, roughly two months after launch, the state had 862 active applications. (Applications that were deemed ineligible or inactive are not included in that count.)
Two weeks later, that number had almost doubled as the state and its prime contractor, Horne LLP, began to expand their outreach in western North Carolina. That included door-to-door canvassing and tables at community events. Outreach staff made more than 24,000 phone calls in addition to paid messaging like billboards, radio and social media.
Advocates, wary of alternative recovery efforts that might not come through for survivors, have aimed to recruit more eligible households in the final weeks. 
“A thing I am concerned about is there may be people who right now are counting on a different kind of program,” said Emma Smiley of Legal Aid of North Carolina, which has helped households apply to the program. “It might be Samaritan’s Purse, it might be a local church, something like that.”
Those nonprofit and religious groups have played a key role in recovery, taking on smaller repair projects on faster timelines than the state is capable of doing with federal funding. But Renew NC’s case managers and leaders alike have encouraged eligible homeowners to apply for the state program regardless to get their foot in the door.
The governor himself echoed that sentiment in early December, pleading for last-minute applications as the deadline approached.
“It’s not an onerous application at all,” Stein said during a press conference on Dec. 3. “We want people living in safe, habitable homes. Especially as we come into winter.”
As of late December, the vast majority of active applications for the program are under intake review, the first of eight phases. That includes a review of “duplication of benefits,” in which applicants have to prove that insurance and FEMA are not paying for the same aid — often the most laborious part of the application process. 
The state is hoping to have most, if not all, of applicants through the intake review by the end of Q1 of 2026, Lilley said. 
In the coming months, Smiley said attorneys would be particularly watchful for issues that pop up with heirship — or proof of property ownership that’s been passed down. Some western homes are generations old, without written deeds or formally drawn property lines. 
“We haven’t seen any of those cases so far, but it’s also very early days,” Smiley said. “So I expect that we will see them.”

FEMA buyout applications still pending in Washington
State officials began submitting applications for a key FEMA property buyout program in early February 2025. Almost a year later, they’re still awaiting approval within the agency’s layers of bureaucracy.
The initiative, called the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program or HMGP, is designed to offer relief for landowners of destroyed or flooded properties. Those properties can be bought out entirely, elevated or made less hazardous with federal dollars.
Homeowners can’t apply for the program directly. Rather, local governments submit batches of homeowners’ applications, reviewed by the state, to FEMA. As of mid-December, North Carolina had submitted 585 total applications in 22 batches. Those requests total $218 million.
Earlier this year, shortly after the one-year anniversary of Helene, FEMA sent the state a letter saying it was eligible to get around $1.5 billion in federal funds through the program. But getting those projects approved to use that money is another matter.
“[Applicants] are in some cases paying mortgages on damaged or destroyed homes,” said Matt Calabria, who leads the governor’s team for Helene recovery. “So these delays are very acutely felt by so many of these families, who are essentially waiting in limbo until we get word from FEMA.”
The delay of the HMGP applications is among the longest bureaucratic slowdowns at FEMA, but it’s far from the only one frustrating state officials. 
Earlier this month, the director of North Carolina’s emergency management department and groups representing local governments in western North Carolina wrote to express their frustration with proposed changes to how FEMA reviews and approves Public Assistance applications, NC Newsline previously reported.
As of mid-December, the state still has no indication of when those buyout applications — or the more costly Public Assistance requests — will be approved, or whether they will be approved in the first place.
State is wary of ‘sluggish’ tourism in 2026, even amid positive recovery signs
Tourism, the engine of western North Carolina’s economy, has steadily recovered over the past year and culminated in a “leaf peeping” fall season that left state officials feeling encouraged about the region’s long-term health. 
But the state’s tourism head is still wary of broader economic trends that he said are almost certain to impact revenue over the coming year. North Carolina is still seeing a steady stream of visitors, Visit NC director Wit Tuttell said, but they’re spending less — on dining, attractions and “just about everything but hotels.”
“That’s not a great thing for the industry, because we really want these people to come here and spend,” Tuttell said. “People have kind of got this recession mindset, it seems. Even though we’re not in a recession, people are behaving like we are in one.”
Still, there are reasons for optimism in the mountains, even if the state won’t have exact data on spending for months. 
In particular, tourism officials have been pleased with an uptick in activity in smaller tourism spots. In the aftermath of Helene, there were widespread concerns that more rural locales would be unable to bounce back like Asheville and Boone. That hasn’t been the case.
“We’re seeing places like Burnsville, Spruce Pine, some of those places that were hit hard and don’t have as many resources – they’ve really done an excellent job of getting back together quicker than we expected,” Tuttell said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/WNC-view-of-the-Blue-Ridge-Mountains-from-Biltmore-Kingdollar-1024x524.jpg,,,2026-01-06 06:12:16.094844

Mississippi’s Trinidad Chambliss nearly gave up football, won a Division II national championship and has shone since being unexpectedly thrust into the spotlight.
Their paths will converge in the desert at Thursday’s Fiesta Bowl, with a spot in the national championship game on the line.
“Only four teams have the opportunity to go play this week,” Beck said. “I’m super grateful for that.”
Beck has been building toward this since starring as a high schooler in Jacksonville, Florida.
The 6-foot-4, 225-pound pro-style passer won a national championship in 2022 — the Bulldogs’ second straight — as a backup to Stetson Bennett IV, learning as he went. Beck took those lessons onto the field, throwing for more than 7,000 yards and 52 touchdowns in the next two seasons while leading Georgia to 24 wins.

A knee injury kept Beck out of the Bulldogs’ College Football Playoff loss against Notre Dame in early 2025 and, after initially declaring for the NFL draft, he opted to transfer to Miami, a school with a potent offense and plenty of NIL cash to throw around.
He’s been a perfect fit.
Poised and steady, Beck has thrown for 3,313 yards and 27 touchdowns on 74% passing with 10 interceptions. He led the Hurricanes (12-2, CFP No. 10 seed) to wins over Texas A&M and Ohio State in the playoffs and is 36-5 as a starter as he winds down his college career.
“He’s very experienced, he’s been successful everywhere he’s been,” Ole Miss coach Pete Golding said. “He’s always had his teams competing at a championship level and being in the playoffs.”
Chambliss’ career took a different trajectory.
With no Division I offers out of high school, the quarterback from Grand Rapids, Michigan, opted to play at Ferris State, where he redshirted the first two seasons — the second due to respiratory issues. He considered transferring to a Division III school to give college basketball a try, but chose to give football one more shot.
Good decision.
Chambliss led the Bulldogs to the Division II national championship in 2024, leading to offers from numerous Division I programs. He chose to play at Ole Miss, figuring he would be a backup but at least have the DI experience.
Chambliss’ fate changed when starter Austin Simmons went down with an ankle injury during the second game of the season. Chambliss took off and kept going, throwing for 353 yards against Arkansas in his first start and playing so well he kept the starting job once Simmons was healthy.
The dual-threat quarterback put pressure on defenses all season, rocketing passes into tight windows with his strong arm while extending plays with his legs.
Chambliss has thrown for 3,660 yards and 21 touchdowns with just three interceptions on 66% passing, adding 520 yards and eight more scores rushing. He led the Rebels (13-1, CFP No. 6 seed) to a win over Tulane in the CFP opening round and picked apart Georgia in the quarterfinals with 362 yards and two touchdowns in a 39-34 win.
“He’s a limitless football player,” Miami coach Mario Cristobal said. “Certainly, you could see on the sideline and watching some of the stuff on TV, his leadership skills and the way people gravitate to him. He’s had a tremendous impact on the program and plenty of respect for him.”

“I don’t remember anything about the woman I was taking care of,” recalled Gilpin, now a sexual assault nurse examiner of more than 20 years who works at Med Center Health in Bowling Green. “I remember paying attention to the instructions on the kit, making sure the police officer got it.” 
She knew after that experience that she needed more education and resources so the next time a sexual assault survivor came to her emergency room, she was better prepared. She had to learn how to balance the human connection and the forensic exam. In 2004, she was finally able to take the class she needed to become a sexual assault nurse examiner (SANE). 
Two decades later, Kentucky still needs to improve access to — and incentives for nurses to pursue — SANE education, a report released in December by the Legislative Research Commission shows. 
The report is the culmination of research sought by Rep. Rebecca Raymer, R-Morgantown, who in 2025 sponsored a resolution directing the LRC to study access to sexual assault nurse examiners across the state. Raymer wasn’t surprised by the report, which she said provides the General Assembly with a good foundation for addressing gaps outlined in it. 
“One of the reasons why we wanted to do the report is we knew there were gaps in coverage. I suspected that … urban versus rural was going to be a big part of it,” she said. “To do good legislation, you really need good data. So, I felt like before we just started passing bills, we really needed to see what that data looked like.”

The report shows an increase in recent years of nurses getting credentialed in sexual assault examination, but an urban-rural divide persists and 100 of Kentucky’s 120 counties do not have a SANE-ready hospital. Hospitals must have a sexual assault nurse examiner on call 24/7 to qualify for SANE-ready certification. 
Of those 100 counties without SANE-ready hospitals, 44 don’t border a county with a SANE-ready hospital, according to the report. This was among the most “concerning” findings to Raymer, she said. During the 2026 legislative session, she plans to introduce a bill that would create a statewide SANE coordinator, a recommendation that came out of the report.
This person would be housed in the Cabinet for Health and Family Services and would help more hospitals get SANE-ready, Raymer said. She also plans to add an appropriation request to make sure the position has adequate state funding.
“We’re still having those conversations of what that price tag would be,” she said, but: “I do plan on putting that in the bill.”
The number of SANE credentials increased from 296 in 2019 to 556 in 2025, according to the report, though Gilpin said that may not accurately represent access to this specialized care. 
“I know of at least a dozen who have those same credentials, and they’ve never taken care of a patient for various reasons,” she said. “So having those credentials doesn’t necessarily mean they’re working as a SANE anywhere.” 
Raymer’s proposed statewide coordinator would also keep a more accurate database of who both has a SANE credential and who is using that credential, she said.

Kentucky Board of Nursing Executive Director Kelly Jenkins said the report wasn’t surprising to her and the recommendations were “very thoughtful and very much in line with the work that’s already been underway.” 
For example, the report recommends hospitals should train all staff to work with sexual assault survivors. A law passed in 2025 already directed facilities to conduct such training. 
Sexual assault nurse examiners are “a very unique, dedicated, compassionate group of people,” said Jenkins. 
“I just have the utmost respect for SANE nurses,” she said. “They’re seeing somebody in their worst moment. It takes a lot to deal with that trauma, especially those that (handle) multiple facilities, so they’re being called out a lot. It’s a lot going through that trauma. They definitely have a lot of respect, for sure, from me. It’s … the gold standard of care for survivors.” 
Kentucky emergency departments are required by law to be able to examine, collect and report evidence of sexual assault and treat victims. Without a sexual assault nurse examiner with advanced forensic training on hand, though, the nurse using a rape kit may experience what Gilpin did in 2001 before she was certified as a SANE: A heavier focus on reading rape kit instructions than on caring for the patient in the room. 
Findings and recommendations 
According to the report: 

Access to training and the costs and time commitments associated with training are major obstacles to becoming a sexual assault nurse examiner. Burnout and lack of incentives for becoming a SANE are additional barriers to nurses qualifying for and maintaining their credentials.
Kentucky has  45 hospitals that employ at least one SANE full time, and 25 hospitals contract with at least one SANE for on-call services.
As of July 2025, there were 512 nurses with a SANE credential in Kentucky. Of those, 491 had a sexual assault nurse examiner adult or adolescent credential and 66 had a sexual assault nurse examiner pediatric or adolescent credential. There were 45 nurses with both credentials. These nurses were mostly concentrated in urban counties.
The number of SANE credentials increased from 296 in 2019 to 556 in 2025.
Six counties have 10 or more SANEs living in them. 
There are 81 counties with three or fewer SANEs living in them. Of those 81 counties, 30 counties have no SANEs living in them. 
As of October 2025, there were 25 SANE-ready hospitals in Kentucky. That number has increased steadily since 2017. 
As of October 2025, most SANE-ready hospitals were located in Louisville, Central Kentucky and Northern Kentucky. There are no SANE-ready hospitals west of Owensboro. 
There are 100 counties without a SANE-ready hospital, and of those, 44 counties don’t border counties with a SANE-ready hospital. 
From 2019 to 2024, there were 4,468 sexual assault forensic examinations that were logged in the Kentucky State Police kit tracking portal.

The report’s recommendations include: 

Hospitals should consider developing monetary incentives and specialized job codes to incentivize more nurses to become SANEs.
The Kentucky Board of Nursing should consider working with SANE training programs to make them more accessible to potential candidates.
The General Assembly may wish to consider requiring that hospitals have a sexual assault nurse examiner on call 24 hours each day.
All applicable medical providers should receive training that includes information on the treatment of survivors of sexual assault. 
Kentucky hospitals should consider developing potential monetary incentives and job codes for SANEs. 
The Cabinet for Health and Family Services and the Sexual Assault Response Team Advisory Committee should consider developing a statewide SANE coordinator position, which would coordinate the efforts of different state agencies and hospitals in order to increase access to sexual assault nurse examiners, promote standards in training and practice, provide technical assistance to build and maintain SANE programs, and to collaborate with community partners and appropriate state agencies.

SANE-Ready-Hospital-Map
Overall, the Board of Nursing, the Kentucky Hospital Association and Gilpin support the recommendations outlined in the report. 
The suggestion that hospitals provide a 24/7 SANE nurse, however, could be a challenge for some. 
“Although we think that is a great goal, and we’ve been trying to help work toward it for a long time, just (with) the reality of the financial situation of many of our very small hospitals, particularly our rural hospitals — I just would hate to have that probably-unfunded mandate in place,” said Deborah Campbell, the vice president for clinical strategy and transformation at the Kentucky Hospital Association. 
That recommendation, said Campbell, is “really the only one that gives me any heartburn.” 
Deborah Campbell is theVice President, Clinical Strategy and Transformation with Kentucky’s Hospital Association.
Creating job codes specific for SANEs could help ensure certified SANEs can work in that role.  
“Many of the SANEs now are working in labor and delivery, or the ED. They have their regular job, and the only difference in pay is if they sign up as ‘on call’ (for SANE work) outside of their hours, and then if they get called in,” Campbell explained. “Is that enough incentive for someone to do the training and keep up the continuing education that needs to happen?” 
Additionally, access to SANE education — and help paying for it — varies by location. 
“I think it is fair to say that if you are working in rural Eastern Kentucky and you want to go to a training, it’s not going to come to you,” Campbell said. “And it’s several days of training for just the didactic part of it. Either their hospital has to pay for them to go and have a hotel and food and travel expenses, or they have to have that burden themselves.” 
“If they have children, they have to have sitters or arrange for their family,” Campbell said. 
“It’s a bit burdensome, depending where you live,” she added. “That’s something that we really want to work on.” 
Having a statewide coordinator to connect survivors to resources, and SANEs with various facilities, as recommended in the report, would be a huge help, Gilpin and others said. 
“I would not be opposed to having such a position at the (Board of Nursing),” said Jenkins. Funding would have to align to make it happen, she said, but “it would just help align resources and try to cover some of those regional gaps that we’ve got.”  
“We know we need more training in the far east and far west,” she said. 
Hybrid training opportunities have and will continue to help bridge that gap as well, she said. 
“SANES are a vital role in providing care to citizens in the state,” Raymer said. “We would hope that nobody ever needs that type of care, but if we find our citizens needing that, I think that it’s an expectation that we make sure that that care is available to our citizens.”
Being a SANE in Kentucky: Part of the healing 
Gilpin, who is the clinical educator for the emergency department at Med Center Health, started her career as a sexual assault nurse with a clear goal: “I wanted bad guys to go to jail. I wanted to get good evidence so it could go to trial and put a bad guy in jail so they couldn’t hurt another person.” 
She’s learned over the last 20 years that real life justice is slow, if it happens at all. 
Now, she’s more focused on how her presence makes her survivor patients feel. 
A sexual assault exam is a success when “the person that I’m taking care of — that’s right there in front of me — is glad that they came, feels that coming to the hospital, having the exam was a positive, and they’re leaving knowing that they were cared for, knowing that they have a connection to what they need going forward to begin that healing process,” Gilpin said.

Still, the stress of seeing so many people — including young children who can’t yet talk about being assaulted — can wear with time. Gilpin has her own mental health “touchstones” that she uses to support her mental health. 
“I like to just be outside, walking in quiet, or spending time with family,” she said. “But I always encourage nurses who are getting into this field to have a recharge, to know when they need a break, to know when they need to talk to somebody else. And I think everybody deals with trauma and stress a little bit differently.” 
It also helps to stay connected to other nurses in similar roles, she said, who will understand the unique stressors of the job. 
“But I certainly encourage every nurse that takes this class: This is very difficult, and it compounds over the years, right?” Gilpin said. “All of the things that we hear and see; the worst part of what humans do to other humans. So I think that having other nurses who are in similar roles that you can talk these things through is very helpful, and then having a plan for your own mental health is super helpful, whether it is in exercise or in activities that just recharge you. I think that that is critical to not allowing this to sort of overtake everything that you do.” 
The hard truth, Gilpin said, is that rape and sexual assault are much more common than some may realize. 
According to the Kentucky Association of Sexual Assault Programs, around 39% of women in Kentucky will experience sexual violence at some point in their lives. Around 23% will experience a rape. And, about 18% of men will experience sexual violence in their lifetime, according to KASAP’s data, which only represents what is reported. 
“What I’ve learned over the years of doing this is this is so much more prevalent than we realize,” Gilpin said. “I learned early on in my career that a lot of the survivors that I served would disclose to me that this was not the first time that they had been assaulted. It may be the first time they sought help, or even felt comfortable telling anyone, but this wasn’t the first time they’d experienced rape.” 
Over time, Gilpin said, sexual assault nurses learn the skills needed to correctly gather evidence, which frees them up to show personalized compassion and humanity to their patients. 
“Collecting evidence is one aspect, and we need to do that and we need to do that well, but more importantly, we need to take care of that human being and ensure that we are helping that human on their path to healing, rather than re-traumatizing,” she said. “And that’s always the goal, that we’re not part of the problem, that we’re part of the solution and part of that healing process.”

Kennedy Profile in Courage Award that he received in 2024 for increasing voting days in Kentucky and protecting election integrity. (Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)FRANKFORT — Thinking beyond this new year to 2027, Kentucky Republican Michael Adams is weighing a complicated question — could he be the type of candidate who gets Kentuckians to focus on the state’s challenges instead of the national politics of the day. 
Adams, who was the top vote-getter in 2023 statewide elections and carried all but two of the state’s 120 counties, is about halfway through his second term as secretary of state, Kentucky’s top elections official. The 49-year-old from McCracken County earned praises from Republicans and Democrats alike on his election policies, but he told the Kentucky Lantern in a recent interview that he cares deeply about other issues too, like the state’s housing shortage and bettering education. 
At the national level, “there’s only one brand” for the GOP, Adams said, but a Kentucky governor’s race is different. 
‘Profile in Courage:’ Kentuckian Michael Adams honored for protecting election integrity

“I feel like at the state level, there’s a little more room for a Republican official or candidate to have an identity of his own, to have a brand,” he said. “There’s a little more room to be a nice guy, and to be modest in your style, and to be substantive.”
Adams said Kentucky Republicans should not “nominate somebody for a governor who is going to be seen as angry or partisan or difficult or unpleasant, nasty.” 
Controversies beset the last two Republican governors, he said, tarnishing their images, and both were defeated by Democrats named Beshear.
Kentuckians, Adams said, “want a nice guy to be the governor, to solve problems, to stay focused on state issues, to be the kind of person you can be proud of when there’s a disaster.” 
“I think people, including Republicans, want a reasonable, decent person who will go do the job, and I feel like there’s an appetite for that, and we see that in who wins these races,” Adams told the Lantern. “But it also comes down to: Would I have the funding available to get that message out right and remind people of what they like about me, and can I get voters to care about the stuff that I care about? I care about civics. I care about housing. I care about education. If we’re voting on stuff that’s not really about our state government, then I shouldn’t win.” 
How will Kentuckians view Trump next year?
Some Kentucky political observers think Adams could have a chance if he decided to run for governor. Trey Grayson, a former Republican secretary of state, said that he jokes “that we secretaries of state are good enough to become credible candidates in our primary, but never good enough to win it.” After leaving office, he was his party’s nominee for U.S. Senate, as was former Democratic Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, and they did not win. Bob Babbage, another Democratic secretary of state, lost a primary bid for governor in 1995. 
Yet, nationwide, secretaries of state have moved on to higher office. Grayson pointed to Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, who was previously a secretary of state. 
Adams has had “a pretty high profile, probably the highest profile any of us have ever had in performing our job,” Grayson said. In Adams’ first term, he had to navigate access to elections amid the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, which was also a presidential election year. 
Also while he’s not the “most MAGA” Republican, Grayson noted that Adams has previously endorsed President Donald Trump and supported policies Trump cares about, like enacting photo ID laws for voting. 
“I think he’s got some credibility, having won a couple times,” Grayson said. “But the question becomes: can he convince people that he’s the kind of Republican that they want? And he won’t know until he tries.” 
Danny Briscoe, a Democratic political consultant, told the Lantern that Adams has earned respect across the aisle because he “hasn’t let politics interfere” with his job. 
Briscoe added that nationwide, politics are changing, pointing to the election of Zohran Mamdani as the next mayor of New York City with more than 50% of the vote. That “wouldn’t have fit the bill of any previous mayoral election that I can remember,” Briscoe said. 
Briscoe said U.S. Rep. James Comer would be “the Trump disciple” of a hypothetical 2027 GOP primary. The congressman has previously said he is interested in the 2027 race. 
However, if Trump’s popularity in Kentucky changes by then, that could be a disadvantage for Trump-aligned candidates, Briscoe said. The president has won elections in the Bluegrass state for nearly a decade, though he will not be on the ballot in 2027 and Republicans are hoping to maintain control of Congress in the 2026 midterm elections. 
“Whether (Adams) can get elected or not depends on the mood of this state, and I think it’s a little too early to judge that, because a lot of it depends on Trump’s positives and negatives,” Briscoe said. “If he’s still popular, Comer would be the one to beat. If he’s unpopular, maybe Adams could do it.”
Legislative session
Heading into what will be the final budget legislative session of his last term as secretary of state, Adams said he would focus on things that can be improved, such as increasing state funding to county clerks, strengthening laws around personating election officials and ensuring funding for the Safe At Home program which protects victims of domestic violence.
Kentucky county clerks have hoped to attract more poll workers in recent election cycles. A big issue that often comes up is increasing the pay for poll workers, Adams said. A state formula that determines how much money county clerks get for elections “was set in the ’80s, and it’s never been adjusted for inflation,” he added. 
“I’m conservative. I don’t like to spend money, but it costs money to pay poll workers, and it’s hard to get people in the labor force today,” Adams said. “And when I was a poll worker 30 years ago in McCracken County, they’d pay me 100 bucks, and they pay the same 100 bucks today, 30 years later.”
Adams previously asked lawmakers to make it illegal in Kentucky to impersonate an election official and expressed concern about a political consultant using robocalls to mimic President Joe Biden during the 2024 primary. The calls encouraged Democratic voters in New Hampshire to not cast ballots in the primary. The consultant later received a $6 million fine from the Federal Communications Commission and faced criminal charges in New Hampshire because of a state law that makes it a crime to impersonate a candidate. 
Adams said that while he doesn’t know if voters fell for the scam, “it showed us what people are capable of doing.” 
A 2023 law established the Safe at Home program, which allows victims of domestic violence to hide their addresses when registering to vote without a protective order from a judge. It also allows the state Capitol to be the address on public records and lets those moving from out of state easily join the program.
Participation in the program has grown to more than 1,000 people, Adams said, but a small amount of money goes toward funding it each year. The dollars come out of a joint fund from fines for breaking laws and are split multiple ways. 
Adams would “like to have a stable fund for that,” and doesn’t think an extra appropriation would be needed, but his office needs authorization from lawmakers to touch restricted budget funds to reallocate dollars to the program. 
One issue he hadn’t yet decided on pursuing this session was pushing again for improving civics education in Kentucky. His office previously released a civic health assessment of the state, giving Kentucky a C grade as residents are generally more knowledgeable about civics than the average American, but there’s still room to improve. 
Adams made national headlines in November after sharing on social media that his office was getting calls asking why polls were closed in Kentucky. The state had no statewide elections in 2025. 
“We’re getting calls about polls being closed. They are closed because we do not have elections today. Kentucky votes next year,” Adams wrote on X. “You cannot vote today in Kentucky for the mayor of New York City or the Governor of Virginia. Sorry.” 
Adams told the Lantern that those calls “proved my point that it’s getting bad out there.” It also showed that more and more people aren’t getting local news from local journalists, he added. They instead are reading about elections and national news from elsewhere in the country. 
Adams previously called on lawmakers to implement civics education requirements for public school students, which led to instituting a graduation requirement for students to pass either a citizenship test or civics course. Adams said the law ended up being a “really watered down bill that just didn’t make a difference.”
Adams said he’s talked about the issue with lawmakers since then, but keeps hearing that it’s not a high priority for parents who contact lawmakers about issues. 
“Of all the things people are talking to legislators about, it’s just not on the list. It’s just not a thing that people are talking about right now,” Adams said. “There’s so many other things that compete, so we’ve not decided if we’re going to make a push for it or not. If so we’ll probably decide in the middle of the session.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_5483-e1767656350741-1024x971.jpg,,,2026-01-06 05:56:45.501462

(Getty Images)Mark Batterson’s new book is a provocative read. Titled “Gradually Then Suddenly,” the author details how the biggest dreams sometimes seem as if they will take forever and then … POOF! … it happens seemingly overnight.  
One of my favorite examples from the book is Olympic gold medal winner Rowdy Gaines. Batterson reminds us that the United States boycotted the 1980 games in Moscow, which means Gaines trained for eight years in preparation for the 100-meter freestyle, a race that lasted less than a minute. Add up all the practice laps for those eight years, and you’ll see that he swam some 20,000 miles for a race that lasted 49 seconds. 
Gaines won that gold medal for the U.S. gradually before winning it suddenly.
When it comes to policy, wins for kids have been coming far too gradually. There have been too many “wait until next year” and far too few lightning strike wins. As the opening gavel falls on the 2026 General Assembly, our lawmakers must turn the “gradual pace” into 2026 “sudden action.” Kentucky’s kids need that pace — perhaps more now than ever. 
Our boys and girls need leaders in Frankfort who don’t just say they care, but who act with a sudden urgency on that commitment.
As laid out in the Blueprint for Kentucky’s Children 2026 priority agenda, Kentucky’s kids need budget investments to support kinship families and hard-hitting policies that reduce sexual abuse and exploitation. Our young people need budget investments to strengthen their legal representation and policies to promote housing and food stability. Young kids with disabilities need more responsive early childhood settings and our teenagers need real supports on issues from vaping to mental health.  
Kentucky needs to lift the well-being of our children in every corner of the commonwealth. Our kids need to win suddenly. While the latest KIDS COUNT Data Dashboard shows improvements in several indicators of child well-being, 1  in 5 young Kentuckians live in poverty and face food insecurity, among other immense challenges often exacerbated by where the child grows up.
For me the seminal question around the 2026 state legislative session is learning exactly where kids stack up in our legislators’ priorities. Are our kids going to get substantial, common sense and focused policy wins in 2026 or merely political rhetoric?
Batterson quotes the heroic Christian missionary Hudson Taylor about turning gradually into suddenly. Taylor asserts there are three stages of any great work: “First, it’s impossible, then it is difficult, and then it is done.” I, for one, am tired of hearing that this policy is impossible and that policy is difficult. 
Kentucky needs good policy for kids done, and done suddenly.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-1408386651-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-06 05:56:45.501462

(Photo courtesy of Virginia DBE Transportation)States including Virginia are responding to changes by the U.S. Department of Transportation that removed the presumption that women- or minority-owned businesses are socially and economically disadvantaged. 
Now, every business owner in the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program must recertify and show evidence that they have faced actual disadvantage — regardless of race or gender. The change has prompted concerns from minority business owners and groups in Virginia, and calls for VDOT to better support entrepreneurs who have historically faced barriers. 
Future of federal support for Va. minority-, women-owned businesses in transportation in question

While the Virginia Department of Transportation has paused measuring progress toward Disadvantaged Business Enterprise goals, the agency said Monday it is actively supporting business owners by providing guidance to the transportation community and holding information sessions to help businesses understand and comply with the new federal requirements.
All DBE and Airport Concessions DBE firms, current and new, must submit a personal narrative and personal net worth statement to demonstrate they are socially and economically disadvantaged based on individual circumstances under the new federal rule.
Further, VDOT said it has stopped tracking progress toward DBE goals and has paused certain reviews until the Virginia Department of Small Business and Supplier Diversity completes checks of all currently approved DBEs and makes the required updates to the certification process.
Joanne Payne, federal lobbyist and president of Women First, said VDOT is working hard under new rules, facing tight deadlines, and appears highly concerned about its responsibilities.
“I know that they have been very concerned and working as best they could possibly do under the rules and their authority to do what was best for the DBEs,” said Payne.
She said that after the federal agency changed the Unified Certification program — which allows small, disadvantaged businesses to get certified once and be recognized by multiple transportation agencies — liability concerns have also grown. These worries could trigger lawsuits, potentially caused by “subjective” evaluations, Payne said.
Virginia’s Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Transportation Association, which supports minority and disadvantaged businesses, was more critical of the state’s efforts. The association said VDOT is merely repeating guidance from the federal transportation secretary and not addressing the need for new opportunities for diverse business owners.
The association said this could be an area for incoming Gov. Abigail Spanberger to address. Spanberger’s administration recently signaled support for diverse groups by appointing Sesha Joi Moon as the state’s diversity, equity, and inclusion officer.
“Our members need opportunities now. Some businesses are teetering and can’t wait six months or a year for a workable solution,” the association told the Mercury.
In November and December, the agency hosted an informational session on the new Interim Final Rule to update firms on key provisions and the reevaluation process. It also held an event on preparing personal narratives and required documents under the new DBE eligibility standards. The agency said it worked in collaboration with the Virginia Department of Small Business and Supplier Diversity (DSBSD) and the Metropolitan Washington Airport Authority (MWAA), to assist firms in understanding and preparing personal narratives.  
“As the certifying entities for Virginia, the agencies also have dissemination notification to firms of the recent changes affecting the DBE and Airport Concessions DBE (ACDBE) programs,” VDOT said in a statement.   
VDOT said it will provide updates on the program as additional information becomes available. If business owners or advocates have questions or concerns, VDOT’s Office of Civil Rights Division can be contacted at CRLMS@vdot.virginia.gov.

(Photo by Shannon Heckt/Virginia Mercury)One year after backup power systems at the city of Richmond’s water treatment plant failed to switch on following a winter storm and left residents without water for days, city officials showcased plant repairs and new protocols on Monday, and highlighted ongoing efforts to keep the region’s largest municipal water system flowing smoothly. 
Addressing reporters at the plant, Mayor Danny Avula said last year’s water crisis — which unfolded just a few days into his term — sparked his administration’s wholesale attempt to dismantle a culture of complacency and manage deferred maintenance. 
Roughly $7 million has been spent on immediate fixes to water pumps, the switch gear, and other repairs to make the plant less vulnerable to problems, Avula said. About $1.4 billion will need to be invested into water system upgrades over the next ten years, according to the city’s long-term plan. 
In an Oct. 8 letter, Avula requested $80 million over two years in the state budget. The money would have been used to help strengthen the water plant’s infrastructure, which serves over 500,000 people across Richmond, Henrico, Hanover, and Chesterfield counties. However, Gov. Glenn Youngkin did not include the funding in his final budget proposal that he presented to lawmakers last month.
“But the reality is we are an old city, we are the capital city,” Avula said. “There are more needs and so our job is to continue helping our state representatives understand that, and showing them that we’re going to be good stewards of that money when they give it to us.” 
If the state does not provide the funding, that cost will be passed on to rate payers to ensure the improvements are made. The city has not stated how much residents’ water bills would increase if the state does not come through with the funding. Still, there are a number of projects that are critical to the longevity of the plant that will be prioritized with or without state funding, officials said.
“When we start talking about not getting the funding and getting funding, it’s going to be a very difficult conversation about prioritization of which projects come to fruition sooner versus later,” said Richmond Department of Utilities Director Scott Morris. “It’s basically picking which part of your broken car you want to replace first.”
As part of the improvements following the crisis, Richmond has been working with the surrounding municipalities that rely on the water system to improve communication. There has also been a change in management and additional engineers added to the staff to help prevent last year’s mistakes being repeated.
Avula said the city’s conversations with Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger’s administration about the funding are ongoing.

Think of the Washington Monument. Imagine it sitting on the surface of the sea, with blades as long as a football field slowly spinning. It’s futuristic and white with rounded edges, like a rocketship. But there are no blasts or flares. There is no noise at all but calling gulls.


 
This story was originally published by Canary Media.

	Sitting on the stern of a shrimp boat in early November, this is what I saw. The captain steered us directly under one of two ​“pilot” turbines. In the distance, I saw foundations for 176 more, poking a few dozen feet out of the sea. The Hoover Dam came to mind, another landmark feat of energy engineering. Each new turbine will be roughly the same height as the famous dam, from blade tip to the surf below.


“Why do people think they are an eyesore? Doesn’t bother me none,” said the captain, Bob Crisher, a commercial fisherman. He’s in favor of the wind farm and believes it will bring down his electricity bills.


Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, America’s largest planned offshore wind farm, was then being built about 27 miles east of Virginia Beach. It’s slated to power up to 660,000 homes in a region with the highest concentration of data centers in the world. With energy demand skyrocketing and electricity costs rising, Virginia needs the last construction push on this project to go smoothly. The developer, utility Dominion Energy, promised the turbines would start feeding the grid by March 2026.


How quickly things fell apart.
Maine AG praises ruling declaring Trump’s offshore wind halt unlawful



Last month, the Trump administration ordered a pause on all five in-progress offshore wind projects in America — including Virginia’s — citing unspecified risks to ​“national security.” It was the largest blow yet to a once-growing industry that Trump has brought to its knees in just 11 months. While Trump spent much of 2025 slowing the incredible rise of renewables, his unrelenting war on so-called ​“windmills” has been more vicious and personal.


In many ways, Trump’s attacks on offshore wind this past year encapsulate this new era of politics. He throttles long-held norms in favor of retribution and personal grievance, acting with dizzying speed. He contorts facts and pushes officials in his administration to do the same.


Left in the wake are everyday citizens — including dozens I’ve interviewed over the past year — who are losing the prospect of good-paying jobs. They and their neighbors are also losing access to public goods like lower emissions, revitalized ports, reliable electricity, and a buffer against skyrocketing power bills driven by an AI boom.


Trump’s grudge against offshore wind began more than a decade ago, when he tried — and failed — to stop 11 turbines from being built within view of one of his Scottish golf courses. He has been disparaging offshore wind turbines as ​“ugly” and ​“eyesores” ever since.


He cranked up the intensity when he embarked on his second presidential campaign in 2023, branding big ocean turbines as dangerous. “[W]indmills are causing whales to die in numbers never seen before,” he said that year — a false statement. Still, attacking offshore wind seemed little more than an odd punchline for his campaign rallies. After all, the Trump administration backed the sector for much of his first presidential term, executing multiple offshore wind auctions that had been queued up by the Obama administration.


But Trump’s hyperactive second term has turned fringe movements and personal grudges into full-blown policies. Like his attacks on vaccines and higher education, his blitz on offshore wind farms is having far-reaching implications that will take years to fully enumerate.


Here’s some initial accounting: In-development wind projects have been paused, delayed, and paused again. One fell apart. Two are essentially mothballed after Trump sunsetted wind tax credits. Port revitalizations got cancelled. Developers lost billions. Related manufacturing is drying up. Tens of thousands of once-promised jobs may never be created. Workers already on the job are sitting idle.


One Trump-voting fisherman called the president’s anti-wind campaign ​“madness.”


But while vaccines and universities will endure through Trump’s political attacks, in one form or another, the U.S. offshore wind industry may not. Despite the ubiquity of offshore turbines in northern Europe and China, there is only one large-scale wind farm fully operational in American waters today. When Trump moved back into the White House, the industry was just taking off.


J. Timmons Roberts, a Brown University professor of environmental studies who tracks opposition to offshore wind, put it simply: ​“They’re killing the baby while it’s still in the cradle.”
 Dismantling offshore wind


When Trump’s first term ended, there were no federally approved plans for offshore wind farms. When President Joe Biden left office, there were nearly a dozen — and at least 40 more were in various stages of planning and early development in waters along the East Coast from Maine down to the Carolinas, across the Gulf of Mexico, and along the California coast.


But, on the first day of his second term, Trump signed an executive order that froze offshore wind permitting, blocking proposed projects that didn’t already have federal approval. And he ordered a new review of the projects that did have federal permits but were not yet fully completed, throwing their future into doubt. (The executive order was ultimately struck down by a federal court on December 9.)


Unease amongst state leaders, developers, and investors immediately took root.


Within days, the first permitted project began to fall apart due to ​“uncertainty” over federal actions. In late January, Shell — one of two developers of the Atlantic Shores wind farm slated to be built east of New Jersey — announced it was withdrawing from the project. New Jersey then abandoned plans to purchase power from the installation. The final blow came weeks later when Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency revoked a Clean Air Act permit for the project. One former EPA official called the move ​“unusual.”


Research cuts and funding clawbacks soon followed.


In May, Lincoln Varnum was called into his supervisor’s office at the University of Maine, where he worked as an instrumentation engineer. Varnum was one of nine employees laid off from the university’s high-profile engineering and offshore-wind research center due to the Trump administration pausing funding. The administration also cancelled federal funding for Maine’s first floating offshore wind array, which had been fully permitted; the project was then mothballed.


“I obviously got a little emotional in the meeting … Something that I cared about was getting terminated,” Varnum told me. ​“It was also the first time I had ever been laid off.”
He sees himself and others who’ve been working on offshore wind as collateral damage.

In the following weeks, Varnum, who once identified as a conservative, was hopeful that some Republican members of Congress would speak up about the funding cuts, but none of them did — not even Maine’s Sen. Susan Collins, a long-time offshore-wind supporter. He described Collins’ silence as ​“rough,” especially since he had voted for Collins in the past.


“We’re a poor state. We need industry. To have a new industry that is unique to us, floating offshore wind, now targeted by the feds … It feels like a kick in the teeth,” said Varnum.











We’re a poor state. We need industry. To have a new industry that is unique to us, floating offshore wind, now targeted by the feds … It feels like a kick in the teeth.


– Lincoln Varnum, former instrumentation engineer at the University of Maine




Trump yanked funding in other ways.


In September, the Department of Transportation pulled back $679 million for infrastructure projects that supported offshore wind, including one that would have cleaned up and revitalized a massive California port. Mandy Davis, a California resident and anti-wind activist, aligns herself with Trump’s false narrative that turbines harm the ocean environment. She was elated by cuts that might block turbine construction in California’s waters, but her joy was short-lived.


In November, when the Trump administration announced plans for new oil drilling off the California coast, she told me it was a ​“betrayal.”


New England communities, which spent over a decade preparing to build America’s first offshore wind farms, also felt betrayed. Prior to Trump’s December halt, two massive projects had been paused by the Interior Department earlier in the year. One of the projects, Revolution Wind off the coast of Rhode Island, was already 80 percent completed.


“It’s like having the rug pulled out from under you,” Jack Morris, a Massachusetts-based scalloper and Trump voter, told me earlier this year. ​“Nobody understands why Trump did it. I don’t know what Trump’s agenda is.”


Revolution Wind had employed 80 local fishermen, including Morris, to help with construction. The project’s pause caused Morris and others to lose some of the part-time income that helps them pay their bills as fishing revenues dry up.


The stop-work orders for Revolution Wind and New York’s Empire Wind were each lifted or reversed after about a month. But some damage was permanent. According to Harrison Sholler, an energy analyst for BloombergNEF, the orders were a signal to companies that America is not a sound investment. Foreign firms had invested heavily in the sector, lost billions, and are now looking for the door.


Trump’s more sweeping wind halt last week only reinforced that assessment.
 What America lost


“What exactly will America have lost? How do you even begin to answer that question?” pondered Elizabeth Wilson, a professor of environmental studies at Dartmouth College.


We could start by looking at how much new electricity capacity won’t be added to America’s increasingly strained grid.


Before Trump was elected last November, BNEF expected 39 gigawatts of offshore wind to be built in the U.S. by 2035. BNEF’s latest forecast is for just 6 gigawatts by 2035 — and even that number could come down thanks to Trump’s latest pause.


Another lens is employment. Together, the five wind farms currently underway have been slated to generate about 10,000 jobs. Now some of the highly skilled workers who have already trained for those projects face an uncertain future. And the 77,000 offshore wind jobs that the Biden administration had projected the country would see in the coming decades may never materialize.


Varnum, the laid-off engineer, said that if Maine’s nascent offshore wind industry rises from the ashes sometime in the future, he ​“certainly would want to help. It’s not something I’m turning my back on.”


He has since found a job working for a hydroelectric company. But Varnum said he fears for America’s energy future and how far Trump might take his broader war on carbon-free energy. The president has already boosted fossil-fuel production and nuclear power while trying to tamp down clean energy. His political revenge against offshore wind may be paving the way for more.


“The guy torpedoes us on Day One and how far is he going to go? How far will this go?” wonders Varnum.
Wilson of Dartmouth says that Trump’s assault on offshore wind is ultimately a battle over facts and truth.
Republican lawmakers again ask Trump administration to revoke offshore wind leases in Gulf of Maine



Fossil fuel–backed activists and groups have for years been spreading misinformation about wind turbines harming whales. They lit the match and Trump fanned the flames. The president ranted and made false claims about offshore wind throughout 2025, in front of reporters, foreign heads of state, and the entire United Nations General Assembly


Meanwhile, his administration quietly axed over $5 million for research into the impact of offshore wind on the giant mammals, ending the best and longest-running studies on the issue, as Canary Media first reported.


Interior Secretary Doug Burgum justified the Trump administration’s pause of the Empire Wind project by claiming the Biden administration approved it based on ​“flawed & bad science” about impacts on marine life, but the Interior Department refused to share the report that supposedly backed that up. The project’s developer and Democrats in Congress are still waiting for an unredacted version.


“There’s no proof, right? There are no receipts,” Sen. Martin Heinrich, Democrat of New Mexico, told me in June. He said the administration hid the report and then used the permitting process as a ​“political tool,” something he sees as typical of ​“a banana republic.”


Without new offshore turbines going up, millions of households across the Northeast will soon pay more money for dirtier and less reliable electricity. According to a recent report, offshore wind power could help keep the lights on year-round in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic regions, especially during harsh winter weather when gas plants can fail. Cuts to planet-warming pollution, mandated by several East Coast states, are also now out of reach. All signs point to Trump’s second term creating a hotter and less affordable future for Americans.


Few people interviewed for this story expressed hope that the damage from Trump’s war on ​“windmills” could be reversed anytime soon.

Alander Rocha/Georgia RecorderTwiggs County commissioners recently approved a massive data center project, sparking a legal battle and deepening distrust between citizens and their elected officials in the rural middle Georgia community.
The decision was made despite vocal opposition aired at a contentious public hearing and accusations that the process was improperly rushed to bypass a state review that was at the time paused.
The Eagle Rock Partners proposal was ultimately approved at a mid-September county commission meeting. A couple months later, a state panel in November officially added data centers to the list of large-scale developments that must undergo a regional impact review. Waiting “would kill” the project, Ken Loeber with Eagle Rock Partners told the commissioners at the time, but he did not say how. 
The Twiggs County data center project did not undergo this review process, which opponents argued should have been mandatory under the county’s own local laws. County residents, concerned that the commission rushed the rezoning process with few details, filed a lawsuit asking the court to overturn the approval, arguing that the county violated its own ordinances and that the commission’s actions “were an abuse of its police and zoning powers.”

The project was under consideration during a months-long window when the Georgia Department of Community Affairs had paused the developments of regional impact process, which the agency says is designed to be a communication mechanism for local officials – and not a state regulatory tool. According to information submitted by the developers, the data center would be built on about 300 acres of land, but there is no specific information regarding the facilities’ square footage or the amount of water it needs to operate, which would have been included in the impact review.
Rob Fricks, a Twiggs County resident and a lawyer in the lawsuit, speaks during the public comment period during the Sept. 18, 2025 commission meeting in Jeffersonville, Ga. Alander Rocha/Georgia Recorder
Rob Fricks, a Twiggs County resident and lawyer, said to the commissioners at a public hearing in the fall that developers were rushing to receive approval “while the dogs are away” and that the commissioners did not “have the facts” needed to advance the proposal.
“I don’t know if this is good or bad. I cannot make a decision because the only thing I heard is that which the applicant has provided, and you guys should not blindly make a decision because the citizens of Twiggs County … are relying on you guys to make an informed decision,” Fricks said. “If you vote in favor of this tonight, you are not making a good decision because you do not have the facts.”
But Kerry Howell, an attorney for Twiggs County, had a different interpretation of the county’s ordinance about which projects are subject to the regional review process and said that it did not apply while the process was paused for data centers. He said he disagreed “with any contention that it is not proper to go forward with the zoning application tonight.”
To win approval, the developer offered a series of financial concessions that were read aloud at the meeting. These included a guaranteed real property tax return of at least $175 million on the land and infrastructure, a $100,000 payment to the school district for career training programs, and another $100,000 to the county for fire, public safety, or recreation. The developer also agreed that the data center would not be a cryptocurrency mining operation, a condition added late in the process after a resident discovered the possibility and alerted the commissioners.
In the county’s December response to the lawsuit, the county pushed back against claims that its rezoning decision was made in haste or as a result of “fraud, corruption, or a manifest abuse.” The county also denied that the concerned citizens “have a substantial interest in the zoning decision” or that they “will suffer permanent, special, or irreparable injury and damage as a result of the zoning decision.”

The situation in Twiggs County, which is home to about 8,000 people, highlights the different approaches local governments in Georgia are taking to manage a surge in data center proposals with little guidance or regulation at the state level. Without state regulations, counties are adopting widely different approaches.
DeKalb County, for example, took a more cautious approach by passing a moratorium on data center applications and holding auditorium-packed town halls where residents could learn about their potential negative and positive impacts.
“The greater benefit may not be in only creating 30 to 70 jobs but in the revenue that you create as a result of the tax digest that could be utilized for revitalization of a community that has been in decline,” said DeKalb County CEO Lorraine Cochran-Johnson at an October town hall.
DeKalb recently extended its moratorium on data center applications until June 2026 and deferred proposed regulations at least until January to allow for further study. The proposed regulations would reclassify data centers from “minor” facilities to massive “campus” developments, which would require special land-use permits and restrictions to industrial zones.
This is playing out as the county faces significant community pushback against a proposed 1-million-square-foot data center in Ellenwood.

Nancy Lubeck, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit against Twiggs County government officials, said that local communities are left “flying blind” regarding the long-term impacts on the state’s power grid and water supply. She said that without a centralized system to track or limit the cumulative impact of these massive facilities on the state, their rapid growth could lead to a boom-and-bust cycle, leaving counties with resource shortages and abandoned infrastructure.
“Somebody needs to be watching to see what the impact is going to be overall,” Lubeck said. “How many of these things can Georgia safely support? And if nobody’s looking at that, then we could end up being in a lot of trouble.”
In nearby Monroe County, county officials unanimously raised concerns about the infrastructure demands of a proposed $8.4 billion data center in Forsyth, a city of about 4,300 people, warning that the massive development could strain local water supplies and county roads. The project’s DRI report projects the data center will require 1.5 million gallons of water per day, and commissioners questioned whether the city can meet this demand, saying that the city struggled to supply existing customers as recently as 2025.
“Major infrastructure would need to be done through Macon, Monroe County, and Forsyth to provide this amount of water,” Monroe County officials wrote in response to the Forsyth data center’s DRI report.
Local officials are often drawn to data centers because they can generate massive amounts of tax revenue. Some of them view data centers as a “cash cow,” a term Clint Mueller with the Association County Commissioners of Georgia used to describe their profitability, which can offset the tax burden on local residents. While the buildings themselves generate property tax, Mueller said that “the real money” comes from the personal property taxes on the computer equipment inside the facilities. Because this equipment is replaced every few years, it can provide a tax stream for the county.
“Probably the biggest positive aspect that a lot of county commissioners are looking at is they’re trying to lower taxes for their other residents, and they look at this as a sort of a cash cow to do that with, so that’s why they like them,” Mueller said.
The revenue can be transformative for local budgets. Cochran-Johnson told DeKalb residents that a data center investment of roughly $125 million per megawatt could yield $6 billion in real and personal property value over a 15-year period. That translates to about $27 million in annual tax revenue.

“Data centers are like the modern-day gold rush,” said Shane Short, executive director of the development authority of Walton County, who was invited to speak at the October town hall in DeKalb about how their local government addressed the proposals.
Counties seem to be racing to approve data centers, primarily because officials view the current boom as a finite “window of time” that could close. Mueller said there is a fear that if a county does not secure a data center now, the opportunity may be lost forever.
“I think we have a period of time where we’re going to kind of run out of new capacity,” Mueller said.

But instead of fishing for shrimp, black drum or blue crabs, these days the 77-year-old is an environmental activist looking for “nurdles”— tiny plastic pellets that are polluting beaches and waterways in Texas and around the country.
The minuscule spheres, typically less than 5 millimeters in diameter, are the basic building blocks of nearly all plastic products. But when they are mishandled during manufacturing or transport, they can slip through storm drains and into waterways, posing a health threat to both wildlife and humans. They are difficult to clean up, and act like sponges for toxins as they progress through the food chain.
An estimated 445,970 metric tons of nurdles make their way into oceans annually.
“They’re everywhere,” said Wilson, who is now executive director of San Antonio Bay Estuarine Waterkeeper, an environmental group focused on protecting Matagorda Bay, on the Texas Gulf Coast. “They’re a real threat to human health and the planet, and we’re trying to protect the communities and the fishermen and the bays.”

California enacted a law designed to curb nurdle pollution in 2007. Now the issue is gaining attention elsewhere: In 2025, legislators in Illinois, New Jersey and Virginia introduced bills.
But the threat of nurdle pollution is beginning to resonate even beyond such left-leaning states. In Wilson’s deeply conservative Texas, a coalition of environmentalists, fishermen, business leaders and local officials is pushing for more nurdle regulation, arguing that the pellets pose an economic threat to coastal communities.
State Rep. Erin Zwiener, a Democrat from the Austin-area town of Dripping Springs, said in an interview that even some in the plastics industry “want to see this issue get solved.” Zwiener has introduced nurdle bills during the past two legislative sessions and plans to do so again when the legislature reconvenes in 2027.
“I think some members of industry know the black eye they’re getting on this and would like to see some curtailment of the worst actors,” Zwiener said.
The plastics industry has long acknowledged that many nurdles leak into the environment. In 1991, it created a voluntary program called Operation Clean Sweep, under which participating nurdle-handling operations commit to certain practices to prevent spills.
Charlotte Dreizen, who oversees Operation Clean Sweep for the Plastics Industry Association, said more than two-thirds of U.S. plastics production occurs at a participating facility.
But Wilson and other critics say the program doesn’t include meaningful reporting requirements, oversight or consequences.
“They’re just being sloppy, and they can do better, but nobody’s making them do it,” said Wilson. “They obviously have to be forced into it.”










They’re a real threat to human health and the planet, and we’re trying to protect the communities and the fishermen and the bays.

In 2019, Wilson was a victorious co-plaintiff in a lawsuit that resulted in a record $50 million settlement against Formosa Plastics, a petrochemical manufacturer that illegally dumped billions of nurdles and other pollutants into Lavaca Bay and other Texas waterways. It was the largest-ever settlement of a Clean Water Act suit filed by private citizens. Instead of being awarded to the plaintiffs, the money went into a fund to pay for projects to reverse pollution in the affected waterways.
Now, Wilson is gearing up for another lawsuit: In December, she filed a 60-day legal notice of intent to sue Dow Chemical Company, alleging it has been illegally discharging plastic pellets from its plant near Seadrift.
Part of a larger problem
Nurdles are a type of microplastic pollution, but not all microplastics are nurdles. Microplastics also include microbeads, which are used as exfoliating agents in cosmetics and toothpaste, and tiny particles from broken-down plastic litter, packaging and synthetic fibers. Some are so small they can’t be seen without a microscope.
Microplastics have been detected in cities’ tap water, in bottled water, in rivers and throughout the Great Lakes. Scientists estimate that adults ingest the equivalent of one credit card per week in microplastics, and studies in animals and human cells suggest they could be connected to cancer, heart attacks, reproductive problems and other harms.
States need to keep PFAS ’forever chemicals’ out of the water. It won’t be cheap.

Nurdles are larger than many other microplastics. They can be seen with the naked eye, and their uniform shape and size make them easier to identify and collect. This past spring, volunteers scooped up nearly 50,000 plastic pellets over an 11-day period at more than 200 sites across 14 countries, 29 U.S. states and Washington D.C.
Texas sites, mostly on the coast, yielded the highest count: 23,115 nurdles. California (4,167), Michigan (3,681), South Carolina (3,094) and Ohio (2,851) also reported substantial amounts.
In the Upper Midwest, environmental advocates are rallying behind pellet-control legislation to protect the five Great Lakes that collectively serve as an economic engine for eight states.
“I think there’s concern up and down and all around in terms of making sure we can prevent this from having a devastating impact in our regions,” said Andrea Densham, senior policy adviser for the Alliance for the Great Lakes.
On the West Coast, nurdles washing onto the coast of Oregon from the Pacific Ocean can be so numerous that “it looks like pellets have become part of the sand,” said Celeste Meiffren-Swango, director of Environment Oregon. “More and more pellets are ending up in the environment and they’re not getting taken out of the environment.”
A question of economics
In Texas, which has at least 36 plastic production plants, Zwiener’s bill — which stalled in committee — would have classified nurdles as non-hazardous industrial waste, triggering record-keeping and containment rules. It also would have required plastics facilities to monitor surrounding waters and conduct monthly audits of spills.
A Slew of State Proposals Shows the Threat of ‘Forever Chemicals’

During a 2025 hearing on the legislation, Logan Harrell of the Texas Chemistry Council told lawmakers that the “industry is already voluntarily addressing the issue,” by improving how it responds to spills and doing more to prevent them. The bill “would result in overregulation and likely add complications based on some ambiguous language and other burdensome requirements,” Harrell said.
Though Zwiener’s bill and a companion bill in the state Senate failed to advance, supporters say the mood may be shifting as more plastic pellets show up on Texas beaches.
In October, organizations representing recreational fishermen, oyster harvesters, tourism groups and others sent a letter to Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, urging him to direct the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality to adopt standards to prevent the discharge of nurdles into waterways as part of its scheduled revision of water quality standards.
The letter emphasizes the potential economic impact of the pollution, noting that the state’s outdoor recreation industry supports nearly 300,000 jobs, $14 billion in salaries and adds $31 billion in total value to the Texas economy.
The agency was considering a ban on plastics discharges during its last revision of the rules in 2022, but reportedly backed away amid industry pressure. Abbott’s office and the agency declined to comment on the letter.
Community members from across the Houston-Galveston region, along with visitors to Galveston, Texas, joined Turtle Island Restoration Network for the statewide Nurdle Patrol.

No city in Texas is more dependent on clean beaches than Galveston, a coastal city of more than 53,000 that draws up to 8 million visitors each year. In October, the city council unanimously approved a resolution echoing the letter the fishing and tourism groups sent to the Texas governor.
“It’s been a problem, long term,” said Joanie Steinhaus, ocean program director at the Galveston office of the Turtle Island Restoration Network, a California-based nonprofit that advocates for oceans and marine wildlife. The group sponsors regular nurdle patrols on Galveston beaches, and volunteers have collected more than 17,000 nurdles in the past five years, according to Steinhaus.
Recently, the anti-nurdle effort has gotten a boost from J.P. Bryan, a prominent Texas oilman and historic preservationist who founded the Bryan Museum in Galveston. Bryan wrote a widely publicized op-ed in The Dallas Morning News, in which he shared his childhood memories of the beaches of Freeport, Texas, and called for action to curb nurdle pollution.
“For Texans who value both economic growth and environmental stewardship, addressing the scourge of plastic nurdles is not only an ecological imperative, but an economic necessity,” Bryan wrote.
“This problem needs solving, preferably by those causing the problem,” Bryan continued, “but if they won’t, then good government can and should prevent companies from causing economic and environmental damage through plastic pellet spills.”

(Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)As the current Ohio General Assembly goes into its second year in 2026, abortion will still remain a topic of legislation, in small efforts to change laws, and large attempts to codify or prohibit the practice.
Republicans and Democrats have clearly drawn their lines in the sand when it comes to where they’d like the state to go on reproductive rights, but the GOP supermajority certainly has the edge when it comes to hearing out bills on their side of the aisle.
A constitutional amendment was passed in 2023 with 57% of the vote, enshrining reproductive rights including abortion into the Ohio Constitution, but Republican lawmakers are looking at ways around that.
While Democrats introduced Ohio House Bill 128 in February to further drive home the amendment, including attempting to repeal laws that don’t align with it, Republicans introduced Ohio House Bill 370, which has been called another “personhood bill” because of its attempt to apply 14th Amendment rights to “preborn persons,” and repeal any state law that would “otherwise allow a person to direct, advise, encourage, or solicit a mother to abort her child.”
The bill emphasizes the U.S. Constitution’s overriding provision, taking precedent over anything the Ohio Constitution “contrary to it,” according to the language of the bill.
The Democrats’ bill does the opposite, seeing to repeal “archaic laws in our state that do not improve outcomes or access to care,” as bill co-sponsor Rep. Anita Somani, D-Dublin, put it when the bill was introduced.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
While neither bill has seen a hearing since being assigned to their committee, this new year is likely to be more friendly to the GOP bill because of the party’s supermajority, though previous attempts at “personhood bills” haven’t fared well, and pro-abortion advocates say they are unpopular nationwide.
Somani previously introduced a similar bill to the year’s attempt, trying to repeal anti-abortion regulations in state laws, but that bill died at the end of the previous General Assembly, having only received one hearing.
The Dublin representative, who is also an OB/GYN, is pushing forward with attempts to further change language in state law with another bill, Ohio House Bill 245.
The bill seeks to change rules for the Ohio Parenting and Pregnancy Program, which provides grants to entities who help with pregnancy services and parenting education. Currently, the program specifies that those receiving grants must “promote childbirth, rather than abortion, through counseling and other services, including parenting and adoption support.”
The new bill would delete that language, along with a provision in the law that excludes entities from receiving grants if they are “involved in or associated with abortion activities, including providing abortion counseling or referrals to abortion clinics, performing abortion related medical procedures, or engaging in pro-abortion advertising.”
The bill removes anti-abortion language and adds text including abortion in the options allowed for counseling individuals who come to grant-funded facilities.
Information on contraception, reproductive health care, and sex education would also be allowed under the new bill.
The Ohio House Children and Human Services Committee received the bill in April, but have not held a hearing on it.
 Abortion, directly and indirectly
The General Assembly is considering other bills that directly and indirectly point to abortion care.
Before abortion is even considered, certain facilities may have to determine whether they can afford to continue, as a bill moves forward seeking to take away state Medicaid funds in the same way as a federal effort in the most recent budget bill.
Ohio House Bill 410 has had three hearings in the House Medicaid Committee since being sent there in September.
It cites language in the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” in its effort to prohibit federal funds from going to nonprofit organizations who received more than $800,000 in federal and state Medicaid payments in 2023.
Federal Medicaid cuts have already been named as the cause of Ohio Planned Parenthood clinic closures and staff cuts this year.
Multiple bills currently being considered by committees in the Statehouse have to do with informed consent, the requirement that patients receive state-mandated documents on specific risks of abortion procedures and potential civil action that could be taken against providers and facilities.
Ohio Senate Bill 309 was heard once in the Senate Health Committee in October. That bill would require doctors to provide patients with a written statement to sign on the risks of abortion services, except in a medical emergency.
It also states that patients and patients’ families could sue the physician, the health care facilities, or others if complications arise that weren’t disclosed before the procedure.
Ohio House Bill 347, referred to the House Health Committee in June, has also had one hearing in its effort to permit “elective abortion” only after a physician meets with a pregnant individual at least 24 hours before the abortion to “provide specific information and document the woman’s informed consent.”
This may put the bill in conflict with an ongoing court case that struck down a previous provision in state law requiring a 24-hour waiting period before an abortion procedure.
A judge in Franklin County blocked the provision in August 2024, citing the constitutional amendment on reproductive rights in his decision. The case will extend into at least the spring before a final decision is released.
The Ohio House bill also creates civil liability against a physician who violates the bill, liability that lasts up to one year after the abortion procedure, or one year after “reasonable discovery of harm,” according to the bill.
The measure also permits the State Medical Board “to adopt rules specifying adverse physical or psychological conditions arising from abortion that a physician must disclose as possible complications.”
The State Medical Board currently includes Michael Gonidakis, a former leader for the anti-abortion lobby Ohio Right to Life, who is still affiliated with the organization.
OB/GYNs and pro-abortion advocates have said patients are already informed of the risks of abortion before a procedure is done under the medical training and rules that exist for medical professionals. Studies show severe complications are statistically rare.

(Getty Images)Most of the tuition spending in the education freedom account program continued to go to private religious schools last school year, new numbers released by the Children’s Scholarship Fund indicate.
In total, $11.5 million of EFA money was spent on tuition in the 2024-25 school year, or about 57% of total EFA expenditures that year. A review by the Bulletin found the majority of that tuition spending went to religious institutions. The rest of the spending went to a combination of instructional resources, online educational programs, technology, home-schooling resources, and other spending categories.
Launched in 2021, the education freedom account program allows families of students who are not in the public school system to access state education funds to use toward private school and home-schooling expenses. The program currently provides an average of $4,900 per student per year. 
The program remains politically divisive: Republicans say it provides needed financial support for choices outside public schools, while Democrats say it is an improper use of money that should go to public schools.
With no legislative majorities to repeal the program, Democrats have in recent years called for financial accountability. 
In late December, the Children’s Scholarship Fund, the nonprofit organization that runs the program, released updated reports showing how much approved vendors received. The release came months after the organization took down similar reports for the 2022-23 and 2023-24 school years, citing concerns over harassment of vendors. 
The new spending figures do not capture the latest expansion of the program. In June, Gov. Kelly Ayotte signed legislation to remove the income cap on the program, but limit it to about 10,000 students. The December reports show a school year in which EFA recipients were restricted to households making up to 350% of the federal poverty level, or $102,200 for a family of four in 2024. 
Here are some key takeaways in the new spending reports. 
Private Christian schools continue to dominate tuition use
Of the $11.5 million that went toward tuition at 131 different schools, a majority went to religious schools, the numbers indicate. Of the top 20 recipients of the program, all but one was a Christian academy. Those top 20 recipients made up more than half — $6.8 million — of the total tuition spending.
The numbers follow a trend in EFA spending that has continued for years. And while the use of state funding for religious education has drawn Democratic objections — who cite the potential for discriminatory practices — the U.S. Supreme Court has approved the practice, ruling in 2022 that it is unconstitutional for states to block religious schools from accessing funding for which they would otherwise qualify. Republicans argue that denying the use of EFA funding toward a school because of its religious affiliation would be discrimination, and note that many of the most affordable options for private education are Christian. 
In New Hampshire, Portsmouth Christian Academy topped the list, receiving $543,000 in EFA money in the 2024-25 school year, or 2.7% of total EFA tuition spending. Trinity High School, Trinity Christian School Concord, Concord Christian Academy, Mount Royal Academy, Dublin Christian Academy, St. Joseph Regional School, Laconia Christian Academy, Claremont Christian Academy, and St. Christopher Academy, all received at least $300,000 in EFA funding that school year.
Religious education dominates online programs, too
For those EFA recipients not attending private schools, the reports indicate that religious education is still a major focus. 
For instance, two of the top three recipients under the category of “textbooks, curriculum and other instructional materials” are Abeka, a Bible-based home school education platform, and The Good and the Beautiful, a similar Christian-based website offering English Language Arts, STEM, and history courses. The two received about $131,000 and $120,000 in the 2024-25 school year, respectively.
And Liberty University Online Academy, a K-12 online program associated with the Episcopalian higher education institution in Virginia, received the second-highest amount of tuition amounts for online tuition payments, or $107,000 of EFA funds in total.
But the program also attracted many secular homeschool programs, too. The number one recipient in Liberty University’s category was Outschool, a website that provides virtual lessons for children.  
Some EFAs used for public school programs, college courses
As education freedom accounts become more well-known, some public schools are opting to recoup some costs through the EFA program. 
Sunapee School District, for instance, took in $14,510 in EFA money; Pembroke received $7,200; and Greenland $6,500. Other public school recipients included Bow and Dunbarton, Pinkerton Academy, Milford, Nashua, Henniker, Amherst, Timberland Regional School District, Dover, Hillsboro, Concord, Gorham, Berlin, Coe-Brown Northwood Academy, Governor Wentworth Regional School District, Mountain View Middle School, and Somersworth High School. 
EFA funds can be used to reimburse public schools for a host of courses and activities, from arts classes to sports. 
Community colleges also received EFA money to cover tuition for dual enrollment programs and other course offerings. New Hampshire Technical Institute received $6,613; Manchester Community College $4,864; and Nashua Community College $4,588. In total, the funding for community colleges amounted to $49,000. 
Some of the EFA money was spent on career technical education, with a large proportion aimed at health care jobs, the Children’s Scholarship Fund reported. 
Dance classes, skiing passes top list of extracurriculars
The numbers reveal a wide diversity of uses of EFA funds. One of the highest recipients of EFA funds in the category of “tuition and fees for summer education programs and specialized education programs” was Gunstock Ski Area, the Gilford ski mountain owned by Belknap County. Gunstock received about $63,000 in funds in the 2024-25 school year. 
Other recipients indicate the range in extracurricular use. The Concord Community Music School, Impact Gymnastics Academy in Bow, the Concord USA Ninja Challenge, and the Creative Dance Workshop Ultimate All Stars all featured in the top 20 extracurricular uses of the funds. 
Some families used EFA funds for driving schools, Boy Scouts of America, piano lessons, and circus lessons. 
Then, there were the material expenses. In that category, Amazon continues to dominate. The online retailer took 14.6% of the total EFA spending on textbooks, curriculum, and supplemental materials, and an additional 3.5% of spending on computer hardware and other tech services, for a total of about $3.6 million of total spending.
Some spending details withheld
While the new reports present broad spending trends, some information has been left out. 
Last summer, the Children’s Scholarship Fund removed the 2022-23 and 2023-24 school year vendor expenditure reports, according to records from the Internet Archive, which tracks website changes. In November, responding to questions from the Concord Monitor, Executive Director Kate Baker Demers said the organization was concerned the records would encourage harassment of the EFA vendors by those opposed to the program.
In interviews, Baker Demers told the Monitor and the Bulletin that the Children’s Scholarship Fund would upload the records by the end of 2025, but said it was considering removing the statistics showing how many individual orders a vendor received if it received fewer than 10 orders. Those statistics, which had been included in previous reports, could allow people to harass smaller vendors and potentially discern the EFA recipient families using those vendors, Baker Demers said. 
But the newly uploaded reports left out the number of orders for all vendors, not just smaller ones. While the total amount of EFA money going to each vendor is included, it is no longer possible to determine how many EFA recipients are using their funds for each vendor, nor what the average spend was per order. 
Administrative rules passed by lawmakers require the Children’s Scholarship Fund to upload certain numbers. According to Rule 803.02 (f) of the Department of Education’s rules for the EFA administrator, “A list of all approved education service providers shall be posted on the scholarship organization’s websites, reported to the department, and made easily accessible to the public to include education service provider name, eligible services, fee amounts received for services, and number of EFA students served.”

Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/06/scanlon-ct-must-solve-its-medicaid-problem-now/,"Surging Medicaid costs and dramatically shrinking federal aid are a recipe for fiscal crisis, CT Comptroller Sean Scanlon warned Monday.","Surging Medicaid costs and dramatically shrinking federal aid are a recipe for fiscal crisis, state Comptroller Sean Scanlon warned Monday.
And while Connecticut’s chief fiscal watchdog didn’t call for changing state budget caps that hamper the General Assembly’s ability to solve the Medicaid dilemma, Scanlon said all solutions need to be reviewed.
“I think that every option should be on the table for us as we explore how to make sure that the million or so people who get Medicaid can continue to get that … health care that they need,” Scanlon said during a mid-afternoon online press conference on fiscal and economic trends.
“We have an overspending problem,” he said, “and 60% of that overspending right now is happening with Medicaid.”
An omnibus federal program run cooperatively with states, Medicaid in Connecticut supports medical and behavioral health services, substance abuse treatment, and nursing home and in-home elder care in Connecticut.
The state Department of Social Services’ $3.7 billion line item is one of Connecticut’s largest annual expenses, representing about 14% of the budget’s General Fund.
Enhanced federal funding ordered in response to COVID expired in 2023, but Medicaid demand has remained much greater than pre-pandemic levels, leaving Gov. Ned Lamont and the General Assembly struggling to keep costs under control.
The social services department overspent its Medicaid budget by almost $160 million two fiscal years ago and by more than $300 million last year, according to the comptroller’s annual reports. Lamont’s budget office already projects more than $110 million in cost overruns this fiscal year.
That’s challenging enough, Scanlon said. But President Donald Trump and Congress last July ordered federal Medicaid spending cuts of more than $900 billion nationwide by 2034, with states beginning to feel significant pain by 2028.
Analysts here haven’t projected yet how much Connecticut expects to lose, though the hit is expected to be significant. Further complicating matters, Scanlon said, pulling back Medicaid spending would be a huge mistake.
“We do need to make bigger investments in the Medicaid program,” he said, adding it would be more harmful — both to patients and to the state’s economy — if residents had less regular access to both primary and specialist care.
“It sounds somewhat counter-intuitive, but the more money you spend [up front,] the less money you spend” in the long run, Scanlon said.
At first glance, replacing tens or even hundreds of millions of vanishing federal Medicaid dollars each year is not an unsolvable problem in Connecticut.
The state has run up unprecedented surpluses topping $1.8 billion, equal to 8% to 9% of the General Fund, since aggressive budget caps were installed in 2017. But Connecticut has used those surpluses to build reserves and whittle down a considerable pension debt that still exceeds $33 billion, according to Lamont’s budget office.
And the fiscally moderate governor has been wary of adjusting these caps, despite criticisms from many of his fellow Democrats in the General Assembly’s majority that they divert too much toward debt and weaken health care, education, municipal aid and other core services.
In recent years, the legislature and Lamont have underfunded Medicaid, authorizing amounts that ignore clear growth trends in demand rather than using special procedures to override budget caps.
Instead, they allow the Medicaid program to operate at a deficit, then cover the cost overrun shortly before the fiscal year ends on June 30, when budget cap rules are more flexible about dealing with crises.
“I think that the issue that’s happening right now is less an issue of overspending and more an issue of under budgeting,” the comptroller said, calling on officials “to craft more realistic budgets.”
The Lamont administration has been researching options to contain the growth in Medicaid costs, though most of his fellow Democrats in the legislature agree with Scanlon that Medicaid spending needs to grow.
“We know we have a Medicaid problem,” said Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, co-chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, “and it’s something we’re going to have to address.”
But Osten said all state officials must acknowledge the full reality of the situation. Even as the budget caps are limiting spending, federal cutbacks on health care, nutrition and other human service programs likely will push demand for Medicaid-funded services to new heights, she said.
Lamont’s budget spokesman, Chris Collibee, said only that the administration would release its next Medicaid funding proposal on Feb. 4 when the governor recommends his budget adjustments for the 2026-27 fiscal year to the legislature.
The goal, Collibee added, would be “to enhance affordability and opportunity for all Connecticut residents.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/scanlanscreenshot-1024x599.jpg,,,2026-01-06 05:12:29.709413

Lawmakers would need a three-fifths vote from each chamber to override the veto, meaning 20 votes in the Senate and 60 votes in the House. 
The bill passed in the Senate with 24 votes and with 62 votes in the House. 
The Ohio Senate would have to start the override process since state Sen. Tim Schaffer, R-Lancaster, introduced the bill.  
“That’ll be a conversation,” Ohio Senate President Rob McColley, R-Napoleon, said when asked if the Senate will try to override the veto. “If we do, it will happen in January, in all likelihood.”
The Ohio Senate will be in session on Jan. 28.
Ohio Senate Minority Leader Nickie Antonio, D-Lakewood, was glad DeWine vetoed the bill. 
“I sent (DeWine) a text and said bravo,” she said. “I think it’s a dangerous precedent to set. I think it opens the door to child labor in the state of Ohio.” 
A child’s first responsibility is to be in school and doing their school work, Antonio said. 
“I can think of a million different ways to encourage more people to come to the state of Ohio and work and have jobs here,” she said. “I don’t think we have to start with our children.”
Ohio law currently allows 14 and 15 year olds to work till 9 p.m. during the summer or during a school holiday, meaning they are not able to work past 7 p.m. on school nights.
In his veto message, DeWine said it would be “unwise” for 14 and 15 year olds to work that late on school nights. 
“I believe the current law has served us well and has effectively balanced the importance of 14- and 15-year-old children learning to work, with the importance of them having time to study,” DeWine wrote in his veto message. 
Ohio is unable to change the law without the federal government making changes to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.
Ohio lawmakers also passed Senate Concurrent Resolution 3 which urges Congress to alter the Fair Labor Standards Act to let a teenager younger than 16 work between 7-9 p.m. during the school year if the teenager has their parent or guardian’s permission. 
The Ohio Restaurant and Hospitality Alliance was disappointed to see DeWine veto the bill. 
“Legislative initiatives such as Senate Bill 50 recognize the importance of employment in shaping future careers by fostering skills that cannot be taught in a classroom, including customer service, problem-solving and time management,” Ohio Restaurant & Hospitality Alliance President and CEO John Barker said in a statement to the Capital Journal. 
“These fundamental skills that young people learn in the workforce, especially within the foodservice and hospitality industry, are invaluable to their future.”
Extending working hours for children can have negative consequences on their academics, said Brianna Booker, policy associate for Children’s Defense Fund of Ohio. 
“If you extend working hours for young people, then they’re more likely to drop out of school or their grades are likely to suffer,” she said. “We’re putting the future of young people at risk for a short term economic relief for the state of Ohio.”
Booker said overriding DeWine’s veto would be bad for young people. 
“Children should not have to be the solution to adult problems and I think that if they make a choice to override the veto, they’re essentially making children responsible for adult choices,” Booker said. 
Ohio businesses can pay 14 and 15 year olds the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour, which is less than the state’s minimum wage of $10.70 per hour, according to the Ohio Department of Commerce.

(Getty Images) It is unhealthy to ask the average citizen, even if he or she is serving as a New Hampshire legislator, to understand the intricacies of nursing home reimbursement, but such an occasion has arisen given changes to Medicaid rates on Jan. 1.
Last November, nursing home providers found out that they would be experiencing, on Jan. 1, the first average rate cut since January 2015. It turned out that the state appropriation could not sustain a rate increase granted at the start of the fiscal year July 1.
To their credit, the Department of Health and Human Services came up with an innovative strategy. Nursing homes had volunteered a fee increase toward a legislative appropriation to retain a contractor to help Health and Human Services address a backlog in Medicaid applications. As luck would have it, the contractor selected is doing the work for far less than the appropriation, so the department recommended the surplus be used to mitigate Jan. 1 rate cuts. Gov. Kelly Ayotte, the Executive Council, and the legislative Fiscal Committee all approved the fund transfer. An average rate cut of 3.91% — or $10.36 per resident, per day — turned into an average increase of two cents per resident, per day.
However, an average does not tell the whole story, which is where things get wonky. Nursing home reimbursement is based upon the medical complexity of Medicaid residents as captured on a particular “picture day” — Aug. 31, 2025, in the case of the Jan. 1 rates. That medical complexity results in what is called a “case mix index,” or CMI, score.
The Medicaid CMI is then divided by the CMI for your residents paying privately or admitted, post-hospitalization, on Medicare. This is called the all-payor CMI. The state “rebased” the system to state fiscal year 2024, and it turns out that the all-payor CMI on Aug. 31, 2023, was a lot higher for many facilities than their Aug. 31, 2025, Medicaid CMI. I’m a liberal arts major, but I know that if your divisor is bigger than the number you are dividing into you’re going to end up with a negative number.
Thus, even with the fund transfer, many facilities were left with a rate decrease on Jan. 1 — some quite severe. Consider, for example, a small nonprofit losing almost $46 per resident, per day. A Keene for-profit facility with New Hampshire-based ownership lost $34.49 per resident, per day, or 11.49% of its funding. The Rockingham County Nursing Home lost $26.77 per resident, per day.  Examples abound of for-profit and nonprofit facilities alike taking enormous hits to their care funding.
No margin exists for these cuts. Upset that the price of eggs is higher, or that the price of beef is up 13% just since last January? Try feeding, say, 100 people each day. Hourly earnings in nursing homes have gone up over 35% since the COVID-19 pandemic began, and yet facilities are still struggling to recover their pre-pandemic workforces within constrained Medicaid means.
New Hampshire’s hospitals, too, have not gotten back to pre-pandemic staffing levels, creating workforce competition between health care partners in a landscape of scarcity — with the irony being that inadequate nursing home staffing creates a barrier to hospital discharges. On the health care workforce front, at least, our hope is that the $204 million Gov. Ayotte secured from the federal government in a Rural Health Transformation Program grant can bring some eventual relief.
In the near term, some respite must be found in the 2026 legislative session for the biggest losers in the Jan. 1 rate change, or care access will be further restricted (many facilities already have waiting lists) and outright facility closures will occur. And in the future we must consider the perverse repercussions of a methodology that, in effect, punishes facilities in their Medicaid rate for caring for those on Medicare, as a facility cannot be all-Medicaid without certain bankruptcy.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/medicaidtrump-1024x650.jpg,,,2026-01-06 04:59:07.923695

(Photo by Morgan Trau, WEWS.)An Ohio judge is determining whether or not two retired teachers’ pension fund leaders should be punished for allegedly participating in a corruption scheme, but investigations into the men are still ongoing.
Franklin County Court of Common Pleas Judge Karen Held Phipps is set to decide if State Teachers Retirement System (STRS) board chair Rudy Fichtenbaum should be removed from his position, and if he and former board member Wade Steen should be banned from ever returning to public pensions.
“It’s an erosion of confidence in the institution that safeguards retirement security for Ohio’s teachers,” Assistant Attorney General Chad Kohler said during the trial.
The scandal centers on Steen and Fichtenbaum and their relationship with startup investment firm QED Technologies, run by former Ohio Deputy Treasurer Seth Metcalf and Jonathan (JD) Tremmel.
“What I was trying to do was to provide benefits that were promised to planned beneficiaries — that were taken from them, like the cost of living adjustment — and reduce expenses when we had excessive investment costs,” Steen testified.
Attorney General Dave Yost’s team has submitted its closing argument on a case we’ve been uncovering for years — an alleged $65 billion scheme inside STRS.
“The question at trial was did they violate their fiduciary duty to the retired teachers, and I think we unquestionably proved that and proved it over again,” Yost said in a one-on-one interview in mid-December.
How we got here
In May of 2024, the governor received a 14-page anonymous whistleblower memo alleging a massive public corruption scheme brewing and moving quickly within STRS. In 2020, Metcalf and Tremmel set their eyes on STRS, according to the document.
The documents claim that they tried to convince STRS members to partner with them and provide them with $65 billion.
Steen and Fichtenbaum had allegedly been bidding continuously, pitching QED’s direct documents to board members and proclaiming the company’s talking points to other staff.
All of this failed, and finally, a whistleblower reached out to state officials.
Days later, Yost filed a lawsuit to remove Steen and Fichtenbaum from the board, stating they were participating in a contract steering “scheme” that could benefit them. Yost started the investigation after the memo, now known as being prepared by STRS employees, alleged that Steen and Fichtenbaum had been bidding on QED.
“Their promotion of QED—a two-person startup with no clients, no assets under management, no track record, no infrastructure, and personnel lacking sufficient experience—was not only a lapse in judgment,” Kohler wrote in his closing.
“It was a calculated campaign that disregarded fiduciary obligations, subverted board governance, and jeopardized the financial future of over 500,000 current and retired educators.”
The state said that Metcalf worked behind the scenes to try to illegally secure the deal, pointing out concerns that the board members were too close to him.
Communications obtained via a records request of a court filing reveal that QED associates consistently told then-board member Steen what questions to ask, gave him documents to propose, and pushed him to follow its plan.
Fichtenbaum joined the conversations, too.
“We’re trying to explain their idea,” Fichtenbaum said.
However, the defense argued that seeking advice isn’t a crime, and they were simply trying to get better financial returns for educators. They also had a focus on increasing their cost-of-living adjustments.
“We need a lot of money in order to restore the COLA, no question about that,” Fichtenbaum said on the stand.
Each of Fichtenbaum and Steen’s attorneys wrote in their closings that the state didn’t prove that they would gain anything financially from this, and no harm was done because the proposal never went through.
Both also adamantly said that they never really proposed $65 billion. This was disputed by the state.
Fichtenbaum’s lawyer, Richard Kerger, added that there is no rule about asking questions that someone else submitted, nor was it harmful that Metcalf was getting access to confidential documents.
“There is no indication that any harm whatsoever occurred from that,” Kerger wrote. “And it is quite likely the information was not entitled to the confidential stamp.”
Then, the attorney added that in the case Fichtenbaum had done something wrong, being removed from his role wouldn’t be “appropriate” because that isn’t fair to the educators who elected him.
Steen’s attorney, Norm Abood, argued that the former board member was a “hero” to pensioners, stating that this has been a sham case.
“‘I’m going to do a thorough and impartial investigation,'” Abood said, imitating Yost. “And [Yost] filed five days later, that’s when he filed this case. No investigation.”
The attorney general had been criticized by the defendants for the quick turnaround time.
“Every defendant I’ve ever prosecuted, civilly or criminal, has either said that I had improper motives, didn’t do the investigation right, screwed something up,” Yost said. “That’s what defendants do.”
This is just a civil case, but the Ohio Ethics Commission has been investigating for at least a year and a half. They would be able to refer criminal charges.
It’s not Yost’s jurisdiction, he said, but it may be warranted.
“I do think they acted unethically,” the attorney general said.
The OEC is unable to confirm or deny the existence of an investigation, but we obtained subpoenas that the commission sent to witnesses.
“It’s not unusual for them to let independent legal processes work out before they duplicate a process,” Yost said.

(States Newsroom file photo.)This story was originally published by Canary Media. 

Extreme weather is making the grid more prone to outages — and now FirstEnergy’s three Ohio utilities want more leeway on their reliability requirements.


Put simply, FirstEnergy is asking the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio to let Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co., Ohio Edison, and Toledo Edison take longer to restore power when the lights go out. The latter two utilities would also be allowed slightly more frequent outages per customer each year.


An administrative trial, known as an evidentiary hearing, is currently set to start Jan. 21.


Consumer and environmental advocates say it’s unfair to make customers shoulder the burden of lower-quality service, as they have already been paying for substantial grid-hardening upgrades.


“Relaxing reliability standards can jeopardize the health and safety of Ohio consumers,” said Maureen Willis, head of the Office of the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel, which is the state’s legal representative for utility customers. ​“It also shifts the costs of more frequent and longer outages onto Ohioans who already paid millions of dollars to utilities to enhance and develop their distribution systems.”


The United States has seen a rise in blackouts linked to severe weather, a 2024 analysis by Climate Central found, with about twice as many such events happening from 2014 through 2023 compared to the 10 years from 2000 through 2009.


The duration of the longest blackouts has also grown. As of mid-2025, the average length of 12.8 hours represents a jump of almost 60% from 2022, J.D. Power reported in October.


Ohio regulators have approved less stringent reliability standards before, notably for AES Ohio and Duke Energy Ohio, where obligations from those or other orders required investments and other actions to improve reliability.


Some utilities elsewhere in the country have also sought leeway on reliability expectations. In April, for example, two New York utilities asked to exclude some outages related to tree disease and other factors from their performance metrics, which would in effect relax their standards.


Other utilities haven’t necessarily pursued lower targets, but have nonetheless noted vulnerabilities to climate change or experienced more major events that don’t count toward requirements.


FirstEnergy’s case is particularly notable because the company has slow-rolled clean energy and energy efficiency, two tools that advocates say can cost-effectively bolster grid reliability and guard against weather-related outages.


There is also a certain irony to the request: FirstEnergy’s embrace of fossil fuels at the expense of clean energy and efficiency measures has let its subsidiaries’ operations and others continue to emit high levels of planet-warming carbon dioxide. Now, the company appears to nod toward climate-change-driven weather variability as justification for relaxed reliability standards.


FirstEnergy filed its application to the Public Utilities Commission last December, while its recently decided rate case and other cases linked to its House Bill 6 corruption scandal were pending. FirstEnergy argues that specific reliability standards for each of its utilities should start with an average of the preceding five years’ performance.
From there, FirstEnergy says the state should tack on extra allowances for longer or more frequent outages to ​“account for annual variability in factors outside the Companies’ control, in particular, weather impacts that can vary significantly on a year-to-year basis.”


“Honestly, I don’t know of a viable hypothesis for this increasing variability outside of climate change,” said Victoria Petryshyn, an associate professor of environmental studies at the University of Southern California, who grew up in Ohio.


In summer, systems are burdened by constant air-conditioning use during periods of extreme heat and humidity. In winter, frigid air masses resulting from disruptions to the jet stream can boost demand for heat and ​“cause extra strain on the grid if natural-gas lines freeze,” Petryshyn said.

“All the weather becomes supercharged,” Petryshyn said. ​“We can all expect stronger storms, stronger winds, and more frequent extreme weather that threatens grid stability.”


 Contributing to the problem?

FirstEnergy has a long history of obstructing measures that would both reduce greenhouse gas emissions and alleviate stress on the power grid.


In February 2024, the company abandoned its interim 2030 goals for cutting greenhouse gas emissions and said it would continue running two West Virginia coal plants. Before that, FirstEnergy backed plans to weaken Ohio’s energy-efficiency goals. And during the first Trump administration, the company urged the Department of Energy to use emergency powers to keep unprofitable coal and nuclear plants running.


FirstEnergy also spent roughly $60 million on efforts to get lawmakers to pass and protect House Bill 6, the law at the heart of Ohio’s largest utility corruption scandal. HB 6’s nuclear and coal bailouts have since been repealed, but the state’s clean-energy standards remain gutted.


Meanwhile, regulators have let FirstEnergy’s utilities charge customers millions of dollars for grid modernization, ​“which are supposed to support the utility’s ability to adapt and improve the electric grid to rigging challenges from climate change,” said Karin Nordstrom, a clean-energy attorney with the Ohio Environmental Council.


“However, FirstEnergy has not provided the same investment in energy-efficiency programs, which can help manage rising demand at lower cost than expensive capital investment,” Nordstrom said. FirstEnergy should fully exhaust those tools and customer-funded grid-modernization investments before regulators relax the company’s requirements, she added.


Limited transparency makes FirstEnergy’s plan even more problematic, according to Shay Banton, a regulatory program engineer and energy justice policy advocate for the Interstate Renewable Energy Council. Earlier this year, Banton reported on grid disparities in FirstEnergy’s service territories that leave some areas more prone to outages.


“It feels too early for them to request leniency without proposing or implementing more comprehensive mitigations based on a detailed understanding of the root cause,” Banton said.


It’s also likely that FirstEnergy’s rate increase of nearly $76 million for Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co.’s roughly 745,000 customers, approved on Nov. 19, already accounts for some weather-related factors. This summer, spokesperson Hannah Catlett told Canary Media that ​“the Illuminating Co. service territory generally sees bigger storm impacts” than areas served by FirstEnergy’s other Ohio utilities.


“Our request to adjust the reliability standards is not a step back in our commitment,” Catlett told Canary Media this fall. ​“We are confident in the progress underway and remain focused on improving reliability through continued investment in the communities we are privileged to serve.”


But fundamentally, additional leeway for weather variation is unnecessary, said Ashley Brown, a former Ohio utility commissioner and former executive director of the Harvard Electricity Policy Group. Averaging utility performance over several years — the way most regulators do as part of setting reliability standards — should already account for that.


“In fact, the standard should always be going up,” Brown added. ​“You should expect more productivity from the company.”

(Getty Images)My father was a brilliant communications professor who had a doctorate and earned tenure at the university where he taught. He wrote books that had been published and took many speaking engagements. He also served as a part-time pastor.
I would have never guessed that my dad would struggle with dementia because of his Parkinson’s disease. I watched my dad and his mind fade away. It was very distressing to me and my family. It’s very distressing to many families.
Dementia, along with memory loss and cognitive decline, affects millions in the United States. Many of them live in Kansas. Too many families are not prepared for this next stage and don’t know what to do. The other issue at play here is the high cost of assisted living and senior care. It’s almost like trying to purchase a high-cost apartment these days. Families are suffering.
My mom works part-time for Home Instead Senior Care. She does non-medical work and helps take care of seniors in their homes. My sister and I tease her by saying she is a senior taking care of seniors.
My mom’s clients love her. However, not everyone can afford services like in-home care. Home Instead does a fantastic job of looking after folks. To try to find care for a loved one is so difficult. It’s hard enough that the family member is struggling, but then to find affordable care is really a challenge.
To have a family member lose their former ability to think and process information is a harrowing experience. People struggle so much these days, and now there is so much dementia going on among the population. Families don’t know where to turn.
I felt as though part of me was gone when my dad’s mind started declining. It was difficult to communicate with him. He had been a brilliant thinker and teacher and now this? I turned to my faith for solace and comfort during those challenging times.
Families need to know they are not alone when a loved one is suffering with dementia, memory loss or cognitive decline. I know of men whose wives have died because of their dementia, and it has been quite a blow to their peace of mind. They had been power couples, and now they lost their true love. It’s simply tragic.
How can we help family members experiencing this grief with their loved one? How can we make sure that people who need help are taken care of by dedicated professionals? We need to reach out and check in on the family and take them a meal or ask how we can help. We need to help them know they are not alone.
There is comfort, there is solace. Let’s reach out and help those in need.

As the world slept, the U.S. dropped bombs in the middle of Caracas, captured a sleazy dictator and his wife, and declared that Washington would henceforth “run” Venezuela and appropriate its oil fields. 
From Mar-a-Largo, Donald Trump bragged on Saturday about the unprovoked warfare they launched unilaterally on a sovereign nation to commandeer it for ExxonMobil, Chevron, and other U.S. oil conglomerates.
All the shifting Trumpian justifications for lawlessly blowing up alleged drug traffickers in the Caribbean and ordering a large-scale military attack on Venezuela’s capital city to topple a “bad hombre” were simply cover for seizing the spoils of an oil-rich South American country. 
We have been dragged into another ill-defined, open-ended war on a ruse. Shades of Iraq, 2003. Back then the pretext was WMD’s or phantom Iraqi “weapons of war.” A “shock and awe” military campaign in Baghdad followed to overthrow another brutal dictator with another open-ended “nation-building” disaster that cost the U.S. dearly in blood and treasure. Over 4,400 U.S. soldiers died in the conflict with a price tag in the trillions. American troops are still there. But at least Halliburton, a massive U.S. oil service corporation, walked away with billions in profits.

It is déjà vu all over again in Venezuela, which has the world’s largest oil reserves. But there is one significant difference. 
In a grave abuse of power, (and defiance of the U.S. Constitution) Trump secretly took the U.S. to war on his own. Without congressional approval — or even knowledge. Without buy-in from the public. 
He acted without any checks or balances on his illegal use of military force to compel regime change, take Venezuelan oil and, as he repeatedly vowed, run the country indefinitely. 
He threatened sovereign nations in the region with similar action if they did not genuflect to him and insisted he was “not afraid to put boots on the ground.”  
Sorry, what?! Besides a power-hungry president on an empire-expansion kick in the Western Hemisphere and Big Oil on board for big dividends, exactly how are the interests of Main Street, America served by the Trump war on Venezuela? 
How has the U.S. military’s months-long buildup near Venezuela, bombing of Caracas and capture of Nicholas Maduro helped over 500,000 Ohioans whose health insurance premiums just went through the roof when ACA tax credits expired in 2025?
How do the billions of tax dollars spent on the U.S invasion/occupation of Venezuela alone, plus the hundreds of billions needed for long-term stabilization and reconstruction, and the estimated trillion for a decade of potentially protracted conflict/insurgency lower the cost of living in Ohio, increase the supply of affordable housing or bring down grocery bills? 
Not at all. 
How will running Venezuela fix Ohio’s shredded safety net decimated by Trump’s historic funding cuts to support systems like SNAP (food stamps), Medicaid, community health services, child welfare, and environmental programs? 
Not at all. 
How will a war of choice rescue overwhelmed food pantries in the state as more Ohioans lose benefits and go hungry? 
Not at all. 
“At a time when families here at home are struggling with rising costs, health care bills, and economic uncertainty, Americans should not be asked to take on the burden of governing another country,” said Ohio Democratic U.S. Rep. Shontel Brown, of Cleveland. 
Did “America First” Trump supporters vote for gratuitous U.S. military conquests in foreign countries at the expense of affordability, health care, and job creation? 
Not at all. 
As more learn that Venezuela is not, in fact, a major drug trafficker to the U.S. and that Trump pardoned a major drug trafficker to the U.S., the propaganda for going to war in South America may be a hard sell. 
Cincinnati Democrat Greg Landsman from Ohio’s 1st congressional district wants to know “what the threats were that could justify military action and putting Americans in harm’s way.”  
Other Democrats stressed the suffering of the Venezuelan people under Maduro did not give Trump the right to wage war on Caracas with no clear goals, explanation, or consent from Congress or the public. 
Most Republicans in the Ohio congressional delegation — save 7th District Rep. Max Miller — parroted the party line about Maduro being a bad guy who had to go for the good of Venezuela and America. 
Ohio Republican U.S. Sen. Bernie Moreno hailed Trump, of course, for eliminating “a clear and present danger to our nation” despite evidence to the contrary. 
Only Miller noted, “History teaches that regime changes imposed from the outside rarely deliver peace, stability, or democracy. America’s role in the world is not to remake nations in our image.”
Scattered protests erupted in Ohio against Trump risking American blood for oil. 
Venezuela is chaotic and corrupt but not a demonstrated imminent security threat to the United States. 
I suspect protests may spread if Congress sits on its hands as Trump continues to issue direct warnings to Venezuela’s new leader and other heads of state in the hemisphere who get in his way as he eyes more territory to invade and pillage in our name. 
What do we get for his saber rattling and war-making besides a rerun of towering costs and grim casualties in a hot mess with no escape? We get Iraq 2.0 and a foreboding new year.

Once Gov. Wes Moore (D) receives Coley’s name, he has 15 days to appoint him to replace former Del. Jazz Lewis, whose resignation took effect Monday. Lewis stepped down to accept a job as a lobbyist for his alma mater, University of Maryland, College Park, and is leaving with just over a week to the start of the 20-26 General Assembly.
If chosen, Coley would work alongside fellow Democrats Dels. Tiffany Alston and Andrea Fletcher Harrison in the district that includes Fairmount Heights, Glenarden and Glenn Dale.
But there could be competition in the June 2026 primary election.
LaTasha Ward, one of the four candidates who appeared before the committee Monday, said after the hearing that she plans to run for the seat.
Ward ran for the District 24 seat in the 2018 primary election and came in fourth among 11 candidates vying for three seats in the District. She also came in fourth in the 2022 primary, when she trailed Alston by 101 votes.
“Service is not something I do seasonally. It is who I am,” said Ward, who is a community activist and founder and executive director of a nonprofit called Solid Foundation Inc.
According to the state Board of Elections calendar, the filing deadline is 9 p.m. Feb. 24.

The other two candidates Monday were Crystal Carpenter, chief operating officer at the Campaign for the Fair Sentencing of Youth based in Washington, D.C.; and Glenarden City Councilmember Cashenna Cross, who has also served as mayor. She works as a corporate planning officer with the National Security Agency based in Fort Meade.
The candidates were asked six questions each, such as how they would work with elected officials, community leaders and residents to build coalitions in the district.
Cross acknowledged society is in the digital age, but not everyone has access to modern technology.
“We send an email, and we think that’s enough,” he said. “But I’m from the old school, where we walk about and we meet and greet” people.
Carpenter said she’s already doing similar work such as serving as chair on the county’s Lynching Memorial Project.
“I’ve always ensured that our community came first,” she said. “We disagree sometimes, but I think coalition building is in my blood. It’s in my spirit. It’s what I do. Nothing’s going to change.”

Coley becomes the third person selected by the central committee to fill a vacant legislative seat in a little more than a month.
The committee convened Nov. 25 to choose Kevin Harris as a state senator to represent District 27, which includes portions of Prince George’s, Calvert and Charles counties. He replaced former Sen. Michael Jackson, now the State Police superintendent.
The committee convened more than a month later, on Dec. 30, to nominate Darrell Odom Sr. to serve as a state delegate in District 27A to replace Harris. Because that district also serves a portion of Charles County, however, the Democratic central committee there also has a say.
Charles County Democrats went in a different direction Saturday, choosing Yonelle Moore Lee, chair of the Charles County Board of Education.
Both Moore Lee and Odom will be sent to the governor, who will have to decide which person to choose as the next District 27A delegate.

Southern California Edison received 1,500 applications for its Eaton fire compensation program and only paid out 82 after close to two months.


After just over two months, Southern California Edison has drawn more than 1,800 customers to a compensation program meant to settle scores of lawsuits against the company over the deadly Eaton Fire. As of Monday, the company has made offers to 82 of those who applied,  Pedro Pizarro, CEO of Edison’s parent company Edison International, told CalMatters.
Fire survivors, who have been providing feedback to Edison since before it launched the settlement program  still have strong criticisms of the utility’s compensation effort, called the “Wildfire Recovery Compensation Program.” They complain that it requires participants to forego lawsuits against the company and blocks them from seeking further compensation for fire-related health claims. Many said the program’s payment caps, which limit the amount claimants can receive, were too low and enable Edison to pay less than the utility might otherwise owe should it be found responsible for the fire.  
The Eaton fire burned 14,000 acres of Los Angeles County in January and killed 19. While the official cause has not yet been determined, a leading theory is that Edison’s equipment sparked the blaze. The U.S. Department of Justice is among those who have blamed the utility for the fire.
Insurance money and personal savings are running out for people who lost homes, livelihoods and loved ones in the fire, they and their advocates say. Many are unhoused or facing housing insecurity. One survey estimated 80% of Altadena residents were still displaced by the fire as of October. The Eaton Fire Survivors Network, a prominent grassroots organization, called on Edison to provide up to $200,000 per displaced household “based on verified costs” to help cover housing costs.
“It’s Edison’s responsibility to solve all of this,” Joy Chen, executive director of the group, said. “It’s their fire.”
About $7.6 billion in insurance claims related to the Eaton Fire were paid out as of November, according to the California Department of Insurance, the most recent figures available. About 90% of the payout was for residential property.
Edison offered a collective total of $34.4 million to settle the 82 claims, and none of the offers were declined, it said.
About half of the claims that received an offer from Edison as of December, Pizarro said, were for total losses, and about half were related to smoke and ash damage. While he did not provide specific numbers, Pizarro said that the claims were spread across geography, income levels and home values. Many of those that have been made offers are part of the program’s fast-track option.
At a Dec. 16 press conference held by the survivors network, displaced residents spoke about how unstable housing and the loss of their homes has affected their lives. Gabriel Gonzalez, a plumbing company owner, lost his home, business and about $80,000 worth of tools in the fire. He lived out of his car for an extended period before receiving a small amount of financial assistance that helped him stay in a rental for a few months. But that money is expected to run out this month.
“As of the first of January, I’ll probably be back in my car,” he said at the event.
Pizarro told CalMatters that Edison will not be providing money to residents for housing outside of its compensation program, citing the need to validate expenses. The survivors network request for housing cost assistance was limited to verifiable costs. 
One criticism of the program was that children do not receive the same compensation as adults. Under the current version of the program, children receive between 50% and 65% of the compensation adults receive for a loss of their residency, depending on the damage category. If their primary home that they live in was destroyed, adults would get $115,000 and children would receive $75,000. These rates are slightly higher than a draft version of the plan Edison released in the fall.
An open letter at the time from the Eaton Fire Survivor’s Network said giving children less than an equal valuation to adults “treats their suffering as lesser when it is, in reality, greater.”
Pizarro said Edison went with a lower valuation because children often don’t receive as much as adults do under similar programs and adults “end up bearing more responsibility and more cost” for the household and “arrangements for the children.”
“The reality is that adults carry much more burden here,” he said, “and so it’s fair that they, you know, that we have more compensation targeted at the adults.” 
Another frustration those affected by the fire expressed was the requirement that participants waive their right to sue the company. Legal representatives of fire survivors who are suing the company cautioned that the settlement program through Edison could short people of any damages and suffering compensation a court might award, as well as potential long term health care compensation or monitoring. 
“We are approaching this as a way to settle litigation,” Pizarro said. “It is a form of legal settlement, and legal settlements are typically settlements of all matters, otherwise they’re not really, you know, they’re not really a conclusion to litigation.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/010824_Eaton-Fire_JH_28.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-06 08:59:42.018184

Jose Angel Amezcua
Jose Angel Amezcua is a formerly  incarcerated firefighter from Salinas


On a cold January day at our fire camp in Northern California, I learned my crew was being sent south. On the bus, I kept wondering why they would need our help with a fire in the winter. 
As we got closer, I saw towering black smoke rising miles into the sky and spreading across the horizon. 
For the next three weeks, I was one of hundreds of incarcerated firefighters who helped battle and contain the deadly LA fires. During the blazes, I moved through ash-covered Eaton Canyon, creating fire breaks, hauling sandbags to prevent mudslides and clearing fallen trees and debris in Altadena. 
Before then, I had only fought wildland fires. I had never seen such devastation in a city. In  neighborhoods I saw homes and structures reduced to rubble and people trying to salvage whatever they could. It was heartbreaking to witness the destruction.
But it was also a stark reminder that I was right where I was supposed to be — helping to save the communities I had once harmed.
Early in my incarceration I knew I had to better myself, so I attended as many classes and groups as I could. Then the opportunity came to join a fire camp, which would allow me to leave the prison and spend time outside. I joined knowing I could earn time off my sentence — but what I gained was so much more.
I joined the Youth Offender Fire Camp Program at Growlersburg, a pilot program launched in 2023 that allowed young people under 26 to train as wildland firefighters, instead of being held in a high-security prison. At Growlersburg, I noticed a big difference from my time in prison: we had better food, better living arrangements and we got to be outside in the woods. 
The Cal Fire Captains treated us like equals. I trained as a handcrew firefighter, creating firelines to contain wildfires and clearing vegetation with hand tools. Then I started to fight fires.

Nothing can mentally prepare you for being on a fire line. You feel the adrenaline, and it pushes you to your limits. Fighting a fire means working 24-hour shifts, sometimes climbing mountains in the dark, using heavy tools to create a fire line. 
I didn’t realize our impact until, in a stereotypical moment, we helped a woman find her cat during a wildfire. That showed me the difference our work made in helping someone during their darkest moments.
Over time, I became a sawyer, someone who cuts down trees with a chainsaw. I began to enjoy the work and imagined a different future as I watched my crew members get released and become firefighters with Cal Fire’s support.
During the LA fires, the Rose Bowl became our base camp, where we were greeted with gratitude from elected officials, celebrities and community members. For the first time, we realized that people wanted to hear our stories, that the world saw us as more than our past mistakes. 
It was an incredible feeling to know our hard work mattered and that others believed we were deserving of a second chance.
At firecamp, the rehabilitation and reentry preparation classes I took with the Anti-Recidivism Coalition helped me get ready to come home and prepare for my next journey.  Fire camp reduced my 10-year sentence to 5½ years, and I came home from prison a few months ago. 
Since then I’ve been cherishing every moment with my family and my wife. Life on the outside is harder than I expected, but fire camp prepared me for the mental challenges of rebuilding my life. It taught me to push forward, no matter what.I had never held a job before. I came to prison at a young age. I never believed in my future. Now, becoming a firefighter is my calling. I’m working to expunge my record so I can keep saving lives and stopping fires from spreading.When people think of incarcerated people, they often see us as a danger, with our past mistakes magnified. Amid the smoke, ash, and destruction of the LA fires, people saw us as heroes, recognizing the good we could achieve when given a second chance. 
It’s been one year since the fires. California has raised wages for incarcerated firefighters and made the Growlersburg Fire Camp program permanent. During the LA fires, the attention to our stories showed that people want to see second chances given not just to firefighters, but to all incarcerated people working to turn their lives around.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/012225_Incarcerated-Firefighter_REUTERS_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-06 08:59:42.018184
,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-06 05:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,The president who cried wolf,Thomas Cangelosi,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/06/the-president-who-cried-wolf/,"As in Aesop’s fable, the world's tolerance for the  President's lies appears to be running out.","Everyone is familiar with Aesop’s Fable, “The Boy Who Cried Wolf,” in which a bored shepherd boy repeatedly falsely cries “Wolf,” fooling his good neighbors into running to the aid of his flock.  It seems we have a President who cries “wolf.”
For attention and power, President Trump’s political campaigns and propaganda have been punctuated with repeated, frightening lies about immigrants, calling them rapists, terrorists, invaders, and murderers.  He falsely claimed they were replacing American workers, stealing their benefits, voting for Democrats, and even eating their neighbors’ dogs.
Responsible journalists have documented and analyzed his record as a serial liar.  The Washington Post documented 30,573 false or misleading claims during his first presidential term, an average of 21 per day.   The Los Angeles Times said during his first Presidential campaign that “Never in modern presidential politics has a major candidate made false statements as routinely as Trump has. 
Historian Douglas Brinkley stated that U.S. presidents have occasionally “lied or misled the country,” but none were a “serial liar” like Trump. And New York University’s professor of psychology Donnel Stern, said, Trump “lies as a policy,” and “will say anything” to satisfy his supporters or himself.  Stern, Donnel (May 9, 2019). “Constructivism in the Age of Trump: Truth, Lies, and Knowing the Difference.” 
Trump illustrated Stern’s assessment when the president instructed his former press secretary Stephanie Grisham, “As long as you keep repeating something, it doesn’t matter what you say.” To this end, Trump continues to claim falsely that the 2020 election had been rigged and that he never lost.
And though Trump’s supporters know that the president likes to cry “Wolf,” they’ve excused his lies the way adults may indulge those of a child.
As in Aesop’s fable, the good neighbors’ tolerance for these lies eventually runs out, and it seems Trump’s supporters, too, may have reached the end of their tolerance for his manipulating lies.
That’s because in this case, the wolf has arrived at the doors of the American public.  It has crept up on them in the form of rising inflation, grocery prices, housing costs, insurance rates, and the national debt.  It has pounced in the form of tariffs that Trump falsely promised would be paid by foreign countries but have come at the expense of American businesses and consumers.  This wolf has clawed at the social safety net, cut food stamps, and slashed Medicaid.  It has skulked into American towns and cities in the form of masked ICE agents who racially profile, terrorize, arrest, and deport their neighbors without due process of the law.  It has raided the Department of Education and left it a hollow shell.
And now just when Trump’s long-term supporters need the president to come running to their aid for a change, he has preposterously denied the wolf’s presence.  “We have no inflation,” the president declared in his nationally televised “60 Minutes” interview.  “Our groceries are down,” he lied.  According to the president, the economic wolf is a “hoax.”
Further, the president similarly has denied the wolf at the door of our allies.  After telling the monumental lie that he would end the war in Ukraine during his first 24 hours in office, the American President has instead reduced support for the victim of the Russian wolf’s attack that has killed the Ukrainian people, ravaged their lands, destroyed their infrastructure, kidnapped their children, and threatened the future of a democratic Europe. Perversely, Trump has instead secretly conspired with the Russian wolf to make future business deals with America, and to force Ukraine’s permanent subservience to the predator.
In other words, in an ironic twist to Aesop’s fable, the wolf now threatens the flock of the shepherd boy’s good neighbors. But instead of the shepherd boy shouting a warning and coming to their aid, he not only denies the wolf’s presence, but he colludes with the predator at the expense and peril of its innocent victims.
But now the American public has had enough.  The President’s favorability poll numbers have sunk, even within his own political party, and Democrats recently swept November elections.
Consequently, for the first time in his political life, Trump has indirectly admitted the truth, (of course for his own political survival.) He’s bailed out farmers hurt by his tariffs with taxpayers’ money.  He’s cut tariffs on some goods, like beef, coffee, tomatoes, and bananas, which amount to an admission of his lies about inflation, grocery prices, and the failure of his tariff policy.  
His consideration of extending Obamacare subsidies admits to the high cost of healthcare that threatens to economically devour his constituents.  He’s rehiring lawyers at the Department of Education to handle the backlog of discrimination complaints.  Perhaps most importantly, he has been forced to face the truth that nobody, including his supporters, believes anything he says.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-06 05:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,AI is stunting critical thinking,Robert T.F. Downes,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/06/ai-is-stunting-critical-thinking/,We can either defend the habits of mind a robust democracy requires or preside over the automation of thinking and the training of automations.,"“Just use ChatGPT.”  
 That’s the whisper in lecture halls, the temptation in browser tabs, and the callow counsel passed among today’s undergraduates as though it were an indispensable life hack, or even a godsend.   
More and more, large language models (LLMs) are becoming the silent co-authors behind too many “perfectly fine” paragraphs that look fluent and polished on the surface but are weightless, insipid, and shallow in substance. Put differently, generative AI capabilities tempt students to stop thinking after the initial prompt, producing vapid prose that sounds like thought while saying almost nothing at all.  
This view shouldn’t be read as alarmism. It’s prudence. Nor does it fall into the trap of personifying AI, as if the machine itself had motives or malice. It is simply an acknowledgment and description of consequences now plain to anyone who reads students’ written work for a living. When we outsource the agency of young learners, whose central task is curiosity and growth in an educational environment, rather than meeting workplace productivity quotas, we also outsource the formation of the mind.
 LLMs are undeniably useful. Tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini are accessible, fast, and relatively frictionless, handling tasks like summarization, translation, outlining, practice-question generation, and troubleshooting with ease. In the right place, they offer a real utility. But they ought not gain a strong foothold in pedagogy, for a tool’s value depends on what it displaces. When it displaces the very work education is meant to train — attention, judgment, synthesis, revision, and the willingness to sit with uncertainty — it doesn’t help at all. It hollows.  
 Educators don’t get to be neutral about that, especially those of us who insist that education is not simply a product, but a public good. In our classrooms, we can either defend the habits of mind a robust democracy requires or preside over the automation of thinking and the training of automations.  
 The reckoning has already begun. In a    Washington Post    article   published on December 12, 2025, professors explain how they are returning to oral and in-class, hand-written exams because take-home assessments have become so easy to counterfeit with generative AI. One professor quoted in the    Washington Post    article tells students that using AI to do the intellectual lifting is like “bringing a forklift to the gym when your goal is to build muscle.” She describes the classroom as a “gymnasium” and wants students “to lift the weights” themselves. Assessments conducted in live settings force students to own their understanding of course material, explain claims and concepts in their own words, and make their own connections, without a hidden prompt smoothing over gaps in comprehension.  
 The gymnasium metaphor deserves to stick, because it names the real danger of AI-in-education: i.e., not wrong answers, but atrophied faculties. You can still “lift the weight” with a forklift. You just won’t get stronger. And the more we, as educators, normalize the forklift, the more we quietly redefine the purpose of schooling, shifting the focus from cultivating the quality of creativity and critical thinking to producing quantifiable outputs that never probe beyond the superficial. Worse yet, our inaction will train students into a kind of learned helplessness: if the forklift is ever unavailable — offline, paywalled, restricted, or simply wrong — many will discover they no longer know how to lift at all.  
 Research is beginning to validate what teachers have been sensing. A    Microsoft Research study    published in April 2025 surveyed 319 “knowledge workers.” It reported that higher confidence in generative AI (as opposed to higher self-confidence) is associated with reduced critical-thinking effort, with people dropping the cognitive work of discovery and synthesis to supervise and verify an LLM’s output.   
 This finding does not constitute a moral indictment against those who use AI tools and benefit from productivity boosts. However, one must understand that efficiency is not the same thing as education. A polished paragraph is not the same thing as a formed mind.  
 There’s another loss we should put plainly out in the open: the detriment to the craft of writing itself. Students already tend to treat revising as a tedious task — something that “takes time” rather than something that clarifies thought and strengthens reasoned argumentation. This is a detriment precisely because drafting, editing, and rewriting are not simply cosmetic steps at window dressing the real work of jotting down one’s ideas. They    are    the real work.   
 We write to find out what we think. We revise to discover what our claims can actually bear. The sentence you cut, the transition you refine, the example you sharpen — none of these are mere ornaments on good writing. They are the mind training itself through reflection. A tool that promises to eliminate revision might save time and labor, but at what cost? For students, it can short-circuit the organic process by which ideas become arguments, and arguments become convictions disciplined by evidence.  
 Creativity is vulnerable, too, in a subtler way. The promise is that AI will “supercharge” imagination. The cost is that it can standardize it. A    paper    published this year in the peer-reviewed scientific journal    Nature Human Behaviour    reports that ChatGPT-assisted brainstorming tends to reduce idea diversity across groups — narrowing and homogenizing the range of available sources and solutions, even when individual outputs appear clever. Similarly, a    Science Advances    study    published last year found that generative AI can be useful for “creative writing,” while still making the overall pool of stories more similar. In other words, outputs are better-looking but less novel. This screams    inauthentic   .   
 The danger isn’t that students will stop producing. It’s that they’ll sow their various seeds of thought into a terrain only capable of producing rearrangements of the same thing, mistaking fluency for originality and coherence for creativity and understanding.  
 So yes: returning to tried-and-true methods is one option. In-class writing. Oral exams. Live defense. Not because we long for grading blue book exams, but because we’re serious about the mission and purpose of education.  
 However, educators shouldn’t respond by fortifying the old walls alone. We should also build smarter, more innovative classrooms that encourage students to interact with one another and actively grapple with the objects of knowledge before them.  
 This is especially urgent for those of us in political science, history, philosophy, and humanities departments, for we are explicitly charged with the duty of forming responsible, inquisitive, and informed citizens.   
 Our aim is not only for students to recite civics. It’s that they can appreciate and practice it. They should leave our courses with the ability to weigh evidence, interpret institutions, argue in good faith, and reach compromise, while concomitantly recognizing trade-offs, resisting manipulation, and revising their views with a budding sense of intellectual maturity.    Democracies    do not fail only because people lack information. They fail because people lose the habits of thought that underlie deliberation and informed consent.  
 That’s why, when designing my undergraduate Introduction to American Government course, I’ve opted to replace the midterm and final exams with a moot court and a mock Congress. The pedagogical aim of these exercises is active learning and interactive immersion. It moves students from rote memorization and recitation to collectively inhabiting the process and stakes of governance. For instance, in the mock Congress, students will certainly learn how a bill becomes a law, for we need a common vocabulary to conduct the exercise in the first place. The idea is that they will then apply what they have learned from our readings, not on paper but through first-hand experience with agenda-setting, coalition-building, bargaining, and the hard calculus of compromise.  
 This functions like an oral exam with an interactive twist that transforms the classroom into an animated learning community. It makes thinking public, accountable, and alive. Students cannot prompt their way through discussion or automate their intellectual courage.  
 The classroom should be one of the few places where students are expected to try, experiment, take intellectual risks, and fail with low stakes. These are all elements of personal and intellectual growth. When AI becomes the ever-present escape hatch, students lose permission to participate in this process. They stop drafting and start generating. They stop thinking and start submitting.  
 So here’s the call, educators. Fight back! Neither panic nor resignation will take us far. But thoughtful, creative design can. Bring back assessments that make thinking visible and accountable. Create assignments that involve trial and error and demand spontaneity. Defend the classroom as a civic workshop, a space where minds are trained for free inquiry rather than optimized for productivity.  
 If we don’t protect critical thinking now, we won’t merely see worse essays. We’ll see a weaker, incurious citizenry.

April McClain Delaney (D-6th.) outside her Capitol Hill office on Jan. 3, 2025, shortly before being sworn in to the 119th Congress. (Photo by Steve Crane/Maryland Matters)Rep. April McClain Delaney (D-6th) said Monday that House Democrats “must imminently consider impeachment proceedings” against President Donald Trump for the unauthorized raid in Venezuela and his claim that the U.S. would “run” the county for the timebeing.
“This move follows a year in which he has illegally dismantled federal agencies, conducted cruel immigration raids against our neighbors – including American citizens – instigated an unlawful trade war, called for the execution of sitting Members of Congress, and now is escalating international tensions even further with military threats against Colombia and Greenland,” McClain Delaney said in a statement released by her office.
“These individual actions are impeachable offenses in their own right, but their ever mounting cumulative impact on our country’s stability and health puts everything in a new light. I now believe that our Democratic Caucus must imminently consider impeachment proceedings,” her statement said.
It’s a slight step forward for McClain Delaney, who said on her campaign’s X account Saturday that the invasion of Venezuela was an impeachable offense, but that, “Whether it makes sense to pursue impeachment as the best strategy to end this lawlessness is a tactical judgment that our Caucus needs to seriously deliberate.”
McClain Delaney’s statement comes as she faces a challenge from David Trone, the millionaire who held the 6th District seat before her. In announcing his bid for the seat last month, Trone made criticism of Trump the main pitch, saying while in the House he “confronted him [Trump] head-on — voting twice to impeach him and backing reforms to rein in his abuse of power. McClain Delaney responded by saying she has and would “continue to take on Trump’s assault on our government workers, defend our diverse community, protect choice and women’s reproductive rights, and work against inflation-creating tariffs.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The House tried to impeach Trump before, of course, twice sending articles of impeachment to the Senate, which refused to convict him both times. And that was when Democrats controlled the House and, for at least one of those votes, the Senate. With both chambers now in Republican hands, odds of an impeachment are shakier.
McClain Delaney may be the latest Democrat to call for impeachment, but she’s not the first: Rep. Shri Thanedar (D-Mich.) and Rep. Al Green (D-Texas) filed impeachment motions in April and May, respectively — which Green followed with additional impeachment motions in June and December.
Wilkins passes torch
You can be chair of a committee, and you can be chair of a caucus, but apparently you can’t be both.
Del. Jheanelle Wilkins (D-Montgomery), who will become chair of the House Ways and Means Committee when the General Assembly convenes next week, announced that because of that responsibility she will step down as chair of the Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland later this month. She has been caucus chair since December 2022, when she succeeded former Del. Darryl Barnes.
“From the outset of her leadership, Chair Wilkins brought a vision that was both expansive and grounded, strengthening the Caucus internally while elevating its stature within the General Assembly and across the state,” according to a statement from the caucus Monday.
Through three legislative sessions with Wilkins as chair, the caucus got more than three dozen bills signed into law, including bills creating a correctional ombudsman to assess Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services programs, allowing those incarcerated a second chance at release and expanding the authority of the state’s current Prescription Drug Affordability Board.

The Black Caucus made history in July 2024 when it convened its first-ever meeting in Harford County that was called by Del. Andre V. Johnson Jr. (D-Harford), the first state Black lawmaker from that county. The caucus also led a discussion last year on contested circuit court races, which some members supported and others did not. The measure was eventually tucked away, at least for now.
The caucus also endured some tough battles, such as the shock of Gov. Wes Moore (D), the first Black governor of Maryland, vetoing a bill in May to create a statewide Reparations Commission.
The legislature overrode that veto in a special session last month. That clears the way for a 23-member commission that will study the possibility of reparations in light of  specific federal, state and local policies from 1877 to 1965, the post-Reconstruction to Jim Crow eras, and examine how public and private institutions may have benefited from policies that led to discrimination. The commission is also charged with recommending appropriate reparations, from a statement of apology to monetary compensation or social service assistance.
Peña-Melnyk brings back Mizeur
Incoming House Speaker Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel) announced late Monday that she is bringing on former Del. Heather Mizeur as her communications director, along with a number of additional committee appointments.
Mizeur, a Democrat, represented Montgomery County in the House from 2007 to 2015, when she ran unsuccessfully in the Democratic primary for governor. She moved to her Eastern Shore farm where she hosted a podcast that featured guests ranging from Democratic former Sen. Barbara Mikulski to then-Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, before running unsuccessfully against Rep. Andy Harris (R-1st) in 2022.
Peña-Melnyk said she is bringing Mizeur on for her focus “on disrupting division and bridging the differences that fuel polarization in politics, She believes democracy is not sustained by rhetoric alone, but through daily acts of faith in one another—expressed in how leaders listen, speak, and show up in moments of challenge.”

“She brings unique skills to our communications team that will help humanize public leadership, lower the temperature of public discourse, and ensure our work reflects clarity, restraint, dignity, and truth,” said Peña-Melnyk, who was elected to the House in the same class as Mizeur. “At a time when trust in democratic institutions is fragile, how leaders communicate matters profoundly.”
Peña-Melnyk also announced the creation of a House Study Group on Economic Stability, which will evaluate policies and programs aimed at reducing poverty and improving economic stability, with a particular focus on “the needs of working families who earn too much to qualify for assistance programs but lack a meaningful safety net,” according to a release from her office.
The 12-member committee will be co-chaired by Dels. Robbyn Lewis (D-Baltimore City) and Lily Qi (D-Montgomery).
Peña-Melnyk also named the members of a new rural caucus, to be co-chaired by Del. Jeff Ghrist (R-Upper Shore) and Del. Natalie Ziegler (D-Howard and Montgomery, that will be charged with bringing concerns of the Eastern Shore, Western Maryland and Southern Maryland to the table in Annapolis, she said.

(Annie Knox, Utah News Dispatch)For members of Utah’s Venezuelan community who have long hoped to see the country’s socialist government brought down, Patricia Quiñonez described the United States’ capture of President Nicolás Maduro over the weekend as having a “bittersweet taste.” 
“More than 25 years fighting for the return of democracy, to defeat the dictatorship, and it happens under a foreign military intervention,” Quiñonez, who runs Utahzolanos, a social media outlet and community, said Monday.

“We are deeply grateful that the United States is supporting us in the fight for freedom and that Maduro and his wife are now imprisoned, but the weight of uncertainty overwhelms us, preventing us from celebrating as we would like,” Quiñonez told Utah News Dispatch. 
Now the community is left to wonder what will happen to its members seeking asylum in the U.S., she said, and what will become of the South American nation, its government, economy, and oil reserves. 
That the capture of Maduro occurred without notice or approval from Congress troubled about 50 protesters who gathered Monday in downtown Salt Lake City, chanting “No blood for oil” and echoing similar demonstrations across the nation.  
“It really is shocking, and it can’t shock us into silence. It has to shock us into action,” Sarah Buck, a protest organizer with Salt Lake Indivis
ible, told the group outside the Wallace F. Bennett Federal Building. 
The group urged Utah Sens. Mike Lee and John Curtis to vote in favor of legislation before the U.S. Senate that would block further military intervention without congressional authorization.

Outside the senators’ offices in Salt Lake City, demonstrator Kathy Van Dame, of Murray, held a sign that said “No war for oil.” 
“I’m afraid we’ll wind up with something that’s like Afghanistan and Iraq,” Van Dame said. She added that her mind was on her own relatives serving in the U.S. military. 
“It upsets the international rule of law,” Van Dame said of the strike. “It goes along with Putin and Xi’s idea of the new world order, that might makes right.”
Utah Gov. Spencer Cox shared a social media post Monday from Vice President JD Vance, in which Vance defended the strike and said “The United States, thanks to President Trump’s leadership, is a great power again. Everyone should take note.” 
“This is exactly right,” Cox said on the social media site X. “I’m grateful to @POTUS for taking decisive action to confront narco-terrorism and hold bad actors accountable, including in Venezuela.”

Wes Moore (D). It's the first time Moore and AFSCME have missed the Dec. 31 deadline to reach agreement on annual salary increases.","Gov. Wes Moore spoke to a gathering of state workers represented by AFSCME at a Sept. 9, 2025 event at the University of Maryland, College Park. (File photo Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)The largest union in state government said it has rejected a contract proposal offered by Gov. Wes Moore.
The announcement came hours before Moore, a Democrat, announced reaching an agreement with unions representing six other groups of state employees. The failure to reach an agreement with AFSCME Council 3 represents the first time Moore’s administration has missed the annual Dec. 31 deadline to reach agreement on annual salary increases.
“AFSCME Maryland Bargaining Team members did not accept Governor Moore’s proposal that continues to lag behind the rate of inflation and understaff state services,” the union said in a statement. “Throughout bargaining, the administration had offered wage increases that did not keep up with inflation and failed to fully correct the AFSCME wage scales that lag behind a majority of state employees.”
Over the last several months, the union has taken to social media to highlight the state of contract negotiations and urge members to pressure the governor by contacting his office. The union represents about 50,000 workers statewide with more than half of those working in state government positions.
Two days before Christmas, the union ramped up pressure and unveiled a series of unfair labor practice complaints it had filed against the administration.
A spokesperson for the governor said at the time that Moore “has consistently stood up for Maryland’s workers, making clear that supporting labor and protecting our workforce are central to this administration’s work.”
Maryland union files unfair labor practice claims against the state

But Moore also faces another difficult budget year.
Last year, Moore and the legislature raised $1.6 billion in taxes to close a projected $3.3 billion structural budget gap. The solution was meant to fill that hole and offer a $300 million cushion for the coming year — a brief election year respite before having to face crushing deficits driven by required spending on K-12 education.
Another component of that effort was a buyout program. More than 300 employees took a payout to leave their jobs. In all, the state eliminated more than 500 positions including 170 that were vacant.
But last fall Moore and lawmakers were told those efforts fell short. The state again faces a $1.5 billion budget gap in the coming fiscal year.
A legislative panel is recommending that Moore hold the line on hiring except in critical positions. Such a recommendation adds another hurdle to Moore’s promise to rebuild state government.
On Monday, Moore’s office said it reached agreements with six other labor unions. The agreements include a 2% on average pay increase for more than 11,000 state employees, according to a statement issued by Moore’s office, which said the raises will cost roughly $37 million.
“These economic agreements represent an important step and are the result of months-long good-faith negotiations, reflecting a shared commitment between the State and its labor partners,” Moore said in a statement. “Our goal has always been to balance fair compensation with fiscal discipline. At a time when families and governments are both facing real financial pressures, the State of Maryland is continuing to prioritize the employees who work in service of Marylanders every day.”
The state negotiates annually with various unions on salary increase for the coming year. The deadline for such agreements in Dec. 31.
The statement said Moore “remains committed to reaching agreements with all employee organizations and looks forward to continuing discussions in the spirit of collaboration and transparency.”

The unions agreeing to contract terms were the American Federation of Teachers — Healthcare, the American Federation of Teachers — Maryland School for the Deaf, the Fraternal Order of Police for Maryland Transporation Authority officers, the International Association of Fire Fighters for firefighters at Baltimore-Washington International Airport, the Maryland Professional Employees Council and the State Law Enforcement Officers Labor Alliance.
AFSCME, however, was unsatisfied with Moore’s offer.
The union said in a statement it wanted raises that kept pace with the rate of inflation, provided additional pay increases on top of the cost-of-living offerings, and offered more job security for state employees.
In a statement, the union said it offered Moore “proposals that raise revenues, curtail wasteful spending and procurements, as well as combine duplicative programs that would generate millions in savings. Despite these efforts, the Governor has not embraced these suggestions.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DSC_2115-1024x681.jpg,,,2026-01-05 22:11:44.188103
,New Jersey Monitor,2026-01-06 01:59:16+00:00,New Jersey Monitor,NJ panel advances bills aimed at shielding immigrants from federal agents,Sophie Nieto-Munoz,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2026/01/05/nj-bills-immigrants-federal-agents/,One of the bills would codify a 2018 state order that restricts when local law enforcement can help federal immigration agents.,"Bill sponsor Assemblywoman Ellen Park said the legislation is “about the future of New Jersey.” (Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)A group of Assembly lawmakers advanced a trio of bills Monday afternoon intended to protect New Jersey immigrants from federal immigration enforcement.
The broadest bill the Assembly Judiciary Committee approved would codify the 2018 Immigrant Trust Directive, an order from the Attorney General’s Office that restricts when state, county, and local law enforcement can aid federal immigration authorities. Immigrant advocates have urged lawmakers to codify the directive, noting that it could be withdrawn unilaterally by a future attorney general.
“This is about the future of New Jersey, not just America,” said Assemblywoman Ellen Park, a Bergen County Democrat whose voice broke as she cast her vote in support.
All three bills passed in a party-line vote, with the committee’s two Republicans voting no.
The bills were introduced last week, in the waning days of the current legislative session. The next session begins on Jan. 13.

In a statement, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson cited the story of an undocumented man accused of killing a mother and her 11-year-old daughter in a drunken driving crash in Lakewood last year. The Trump administration has used the story before to target New Jersey’s practice of restricting when local law enforcement can aid federal immigration agents.


“This tragedy is far from the only example of illegal aliens killing innocent bystanders. The New Jersey legislature should focus on protecting law-abiding citizens, not the criminal aliens who kill them,” Jackson said.

The hearing for the much-anticipated legislation was moved to a larger room in the Trenton Statehouse to accommodate the hundreds of people in attendance. Some people watched from two separate rooms, and legislative staff had to print more slips because of the number of people who wanted to testify.
Immigrant advocates and local activists who spoke during the three-hour hearing said New Jersey’s immigrant communities are plagued with fear because of President Donald Trump’s mass-deportation effort. The legislation would make New Jerseyans feel safer, they said, because it would allow them to report crimes to police without fearing they themselves would end up charged with immigration-related crimes.
“When your child’s classmate is struggling with their friend who has a missing parent, when people are too scared to report a crime or seek assistance, when a teacher finds empty seats in their classroom, or when grocery stores and restaurants find that foot traffic has gone down, when health care professionals see fewer people coming in for preventative care — all of those are impacts on all of us,” said Ami Kachalia of the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey.

The bill’s provisions would:

Prohibit law enforcement officers from engaging in “racially influenced policing,” including stopping someone based on their actual or suspected citizenship status and asking someone’s immigration status unless relevant to an investigation.
Bar state, county, and local police from assisting in federal civil immigration enforcement.
Require law enforcement agencies to create procedures to address certain visa certification requests from potential victims of crime or human trafficking, and post those procedures on their websites.
Mandate that prosecutors inform criminal defendants of immigration consequences.
Require law enforcement agencies to annually report their interactions with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, to be published on the state Attorney General Office’s website.

Amy Torres, head of the New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice, noted that the directive has been in place for nearly a decade. Under the directive, people have felt free to report their landlords for not turning on the heat, report their employers for wage theft, or come forward as the victims of crime without fearing they would get arrested by federal immigration agents.
Monmouth County Prosecutor Raymond Santiago said that since the shift in immigration enforcement over the past year, there has been less cooperation from victims and witnesses over fear of retaliation. Years of increased trust from some communities has “evaporated” because of ICE activity in neighborhoods, Santiago said.

Francesca Chabla, an immigration attorney with immigrant advocacy group Make the Road New Jersey, said she’s received countless calls from clients who are unsure whether they should enroll their children for free and reduced lunch programs out of fear that they could be targeted. Many residents don’t know who to trust, she said.
Chabla said the package of bills would provide clarity not only for residents, but for immigration attorneys who can “confidently tell the community members that they can safely access health care, schools, and food pantries” without fear of losing their due process rights.
States like California, Illinois, and Washington have passed similar legislation, Kachalia noted.
One of the other bills advanced Monday would require the attorney general to develop policies for so-called sensitive locations that would be barred from assisting or participating in federal civil law enforcement, and it would prohibit enforcement on their premises. The locations include health care facilities, public schools, and domestic violence shelters, among other places.
The third bill would bar government entities and health care facilities from requesting or collecting certain information from residents unless “strictly necessary” to assess eligibility for the requested public service. The information would include a person’s immigration status, place of birth, social security number, and individual taxpayer identification number.
For more than a year, Park and some of her Democratic colleagues have pushed for passage of a separate bill, called the Immigrant Trust Act, that includes provisions from the three bills advanced Monday. The older bill has languished, and Park said it was easier to get support by breaking the bill into three parts. She sponsored two of the three bills advanced Monday.
“I think if we were to put this all in one bill, it would’ve been too much to kind of comprehend and digest … so I think it was just better formatted for three pieces of legislation,” she said.
The Republicans on the committee — Assemblywoman Vicky Flynn (R-Monmouth) and Assemblyman Bob Auth (R-Bergen) — questioned whether the bills would withstand legal scrutiny. Auth read aloud a description of the U.S. Constitution’s supremacy clause, which bars states from regulating the federal government’s actions.
Auth asked a housing attorney who said she represents tenants who are scared of reporting bad landlords what the “genesis of that fear is.”
“What is it? What’s causing the fear? If you’re here as a citizen, you go to court, you get equal justice, right? If you’re here as a resident alien and you go to court, you get equal justice, right? So what is the problem?” Auth asked her.

Karen Bennett of Stone Mountain resigned effective Jan. 1, and Monday was the last day for Rep. Lynn Heffner of Augusta. The House and Senate are set to gavel in Monday for a legislative session set to last through early spring.","Former Rep. Karen Bennett of Stone Mountain has been charged with allegedly taking advantage of a program meant for people who lost their jobs because of the pandemic. Official Georgia House of Representatives photoA Democratic state lawmaker resigned her seat days before she was charged with fraudulently receiving nearly $14,000 in unemployment benefits intended for people who lost their jobs because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Former Rep. Karen Bennett of Stone Mountain became the second Georgia House Democrat accused of illegally exploiting the program after Covington Rep. Sharon Henderson was arrested and charged on similar grounds last month.
Bennett holds a doctorate in physical therapy and the allegations center around her company called Metro Therapy Providers.
According to a charging document from the U.S. District Court in Atlanta, in May 2020, Bennett applied for federal pandemic relief funds listing two employers, the state General Assembly and Metro Therapy.
According to the document, Bennett stated in her application for pandemic unemployment relief that her job included providing in-home physical therapy services and that she was unable to perform her job because of pandemic guidelines. Prosecutors say those were lies.
“Before the pandemic her actual role with Metro Therapy was an administrative one and she worked from her home office; she did not provide in-home services for clients,” the charging document reads. “She was not prohibited from reaching her home office because of the pandemic. She was able to continue working as usual from her home to support Metro Therapy throughout the pandemic, and the therapists who provided actual services to clients were able to continue their work after a brief disruption.”
Bennett faces one count of making false statements in connection with the benefits.
Prosecutors also allege Bennett did not disclose that she had separate employment through a church, which paid her $905 each week she was claiming pandemic benefits.
According to court documents, Bennett pleaded not guilty and was released on $10,000 bond. She did not immediately respond to a call and email seeking comment Monday evening.
In a resignation letter to Gov. Brian Kemp, Bennett, who was first elected in 2012, did not give a reason for her departure.
“I am proud of the work accomplished by the Georgia General Assembly when we came together to advance policies that strengthened our state and improved the lives of all Georgians,” she wrote. “Serving in this capacity has truly been a labor of love and one that I will miss.”
Henderson’s future in the chamber is uncertain. She was charged with fraudulently collecting more than $17,000 in pandemic unemployment benefits but has not resigned.
Henderson maintains her innocence, and in a statement posted to social media, asked supporters for donations to help her fight what she called wrongful accusations.
Another Democratic state lawmaker, Rep. Lynn Heffner of Augusta, resigned effective Monday citing damage to her home from Hurricane Helene and the state law requiring representatives to live in the districts they represent.
“As recovery efforts have continued, the rebuilding process has reached an impasse, creating uncertainty that makes it difficult to confidently maintain constitutional residency while continuing legislative service,” Heffner wrote.
Prior to her election in 2022, Heffner served in the U.S. Army and worked as director of motor vehicle registration in Richmond County. She sat on committees including the House Committee on Defense and Veterans Affairs.
The House and Senate are set to gavel in Monday for a legislative session set to last through early spring.
With the two departures, the House now includes 98 Republicans and 79 Democrats. A vacancy left by the death of Canton Republican Rep. Mandi Ballinger is set to be filled with a special election runoff Tuesday between Republican Bill Fincher and Democrat Scott Sanders.
Kemp will declare special elections to fill the seats. As of Monday, Kemp’s office said no timeline has yet been set.

(Photo by Angela Breck/Maryland Matters)The end of 2025 meant the end of federal tax credits that helped keep health insurance costs down for some 190,000 Marylanders, but it wasn’t the end of all help for those policy holders.
The state, anticipating the possible loss of federal assistance, set aside millions this year and next. And state officials gathered Monday to urge people to take advantage of the state’s Easy Enrollment program, which could help families get connected to more affordable health care by checking a box on their state tax forms.
“As the clock struck midnight on Dec. 31, thousands of Marylanders greeted the New Year not with cheers, but with increased anxiety,” Comptroller Brooke Lierman (D) said at the Center for Urban Families in Baltimore Monday. “With increased worry and concern at the prospect of going without health insurance because they are now facing higher health insurance premiums.”
Lierman joined other state officials and health care advocates to raise awareness of Easy Enrollment, which has helped thousands of Marylanders get connected to affordable insurance over the five years since its launch. Under the program, Marylanders can check a box on their state tax return saying they are interested in learning about their health care options through the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange, the state’s Affordable Care Act marketplace.

The exchange then reaches out with information about available health insurance options and whether those households qualify for subsidies to bring those costs down further.
Advocates say Easy Enrollment is especially important due to the expiration of a popular COVID-19 era expansion of a federal tax credit under the Affordable Care Act, which will lead to a hike in health insurance costs. State fiscal analysts estimated that the expiration of the federal advanced premium tax credits would mean the loss of about $150 million to Maryland.
In anticipation of that, legislators created a state-based health insurance subsidies program, aimed at countering some of the federal cuts. The state program is not expected to generate more than $75 million this year, half the federal loss, so the state program was oriented towar lower-income families. Some will see the same savings they got from the federal program, while others may not be eligible for a state subsidy.
The expiration of the federal Enhanced Premium Tax Credit is expected to lead higher premiums for some 20 million Americans who directly benefited from the assistance through the Affordable Care Act. Meanwhile, the end of the tax credit has already led to increases in the private insurance market, with Maryland regulators approving an average 13.4% premium rate increase this year.
State OKs 13.4% average premium hike for state’s health care marketplace plans

That’s why lawmakers like Health and Government Operations Vice Chair Bonnie Cullison (D-Montgomery) urge Marylanders to use the Easy Enrollment option on their state tax forms to see if they qualify for more affordable health care coverage.
“The Easy Enrollment program was designed to use government processes to the absolute benefit of Marylanders,” Cullison said. “When given information from the Comptroller’s office … the exchange can quickly determine the eligibility for free or reduced health care options — or help folks compare plans that will best meet their needs.”
Vincent DeMarco with Maryland Health Care All coalition announced a $100,000 informational campaign to help uninsured Marylanders learn about the Easy Enrollment option, as those who qualify for Medicaid can still get enrolled in health care coverage.
“If you’re uninsured and you missed Open Enrollment, and you’re eligible for Medicaid – check the box at tax time and you could get enrolled,” DeMarco said. “It is especially important now.”
Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) said any effort to make access to insurance easier can help combat changes coming to health care through the Republican-controlled Congress and the Trump administration.
“Because they rolled those (expanded tax credits) back, allowed them to die at midnight on Dec. 31,” Van Hollen said, “as a result, 20 million Americans will no longer get the benefit of that tax credit. They’ll see their premiums go through the roof.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/tax-forms-1.jpg,,,2026-01-05 21:56:54.189774
,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-06 01:28:19+00:00,CT Mirror,CT’s Grand Old Party tries to go viral with mockery of Lamont,Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/05/ct-gop-ned-lamont-pizza-video/,The CT GOP opened a digital advertising campaign with a 1-minute video portraying Gov. Ned Lamont as indifferent to the high cost of living.,"Facing strong headwinds in the midterms, the Connecticut Republican Party opened a digital advertising campaign Monday with a 1-minute video portraying Gov. Ned Lamont, a wealthy Democrat seeking a third term in 2026, as indifferent to the high cost of living in Connecticut.
The piece offers a mocking twist on the Lamont administration’s light-hearted marketing campaign declaring “Connecticut home of the pizza capital of the United States,” a boast on social media and on some highway signs at the Connecticut border with New York.
“You know, Ned Lamont is, we think, channeling his inner Marie Antoinette and [saying] ‘Let Connecticut eat pizza!’” said Ben Proto, the chair of the Republican Party.
Proto said the campaign, at least initially, would be “mostly organic, our social media.” The state GOP has not been a reliably effective player on social media, unable or unwilling to engage in posts with the potential to go viral, fueled either by humor or outrage.
The piece was shown to reporters at 1 p.m., copies provided on thumb drives — not online. The video was not posted on the party’s Facebook or Instagram pages for nearly four hours. It did not appear on the party’s rarely updated X account.
It can be seen here. on the GOP’s Facebook page.

Proto said the party was ramping up with the start of 2026, when the governor, the other statewide constitutional officers, the General Assembly and the U.S. House delegation will be on the ballot. He said the party was quick to defend the Trump administration’s arrest of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro against criticism from Connecticut’s Democratic senators and one of its congressmen.
“We’re doing far better on social media,” he said.
Proto was elected in June 2021 as state party chair, an increasingly ill-defined job in an era when political power and influence has migrated to Super PACs — even more so in Connecticut, where the GOP controls no levers of government and has been unable to win a congressional race for 20 years.
“What I’ve really learned over the last four and a half years is what my job is and what the job of this party is,” Proto said. “And the job of this party, ultimately, is not to define the issues. That’s up to the candidates. Our job is to help our candidates amplify their message. And we know the message on our side is that the Democrats have made this unaffordable.”
The press conference at the party’s headquarters in Middletown was a rarity.
“The election cycle has officially begun,” Proto said. “Some will say it started the day after the November elections, and that’s true, because that’s the day Ned Lamont found the word ‘affordability’ in his vocabulary. Prior to that, it didn’t exist. And we all know that the issue here in Connecticut is affordability, as it is across the country.”
Acting as a surrogate for the Lamont campaign, state Sen. Matt Lesser, D-Middletown, waited outside the GOP headquarters to insist that emphasizing the cost of living is not without risk for Republicans who mostly have remained silent over the trade war that President Donald Trump is waging against economic rivals and allies alike, his suspension of job-producing off-shore wind projects, and his support for the expiration of tax credits that will produce an increase in health costs under the Affordable Care Act.
“I just thought it was a stunning display, incredibly out of touch at a time when the country is reeling from tariffs from Donald Trump and Republicans in Washington, the same week that health insurance prices for tens of thousands of Connecticut residents just tripled because of Donald Trump and Republicans in Washington,” Lesser said.
Each of Trump’s presidential victories have been followed by Republican losses in Connecticut.
When Trump first took office in January 2017, Republicans were on the rise at the General Assembly. They still were a minority but strong enough to influence fiscal policies, including the adoption of stronger spending caps as part of a bipartisan budget deal in 2017.
The GOP held 18 of the 36 seats in the Senate and were only five short of the 76 seats necessary for a majority in the 151-member House. Democrats made huge gains in 2018, and they now outnumber Republicans by at least 2-1 margins in each chamber of the General Assembly.
As was the case after Trump’s first election, Democrats flipped control of municipal governments in 28 communities in November, the first general election since his return to the White House. Proto said his goal for 2026 was progress, not a legislative majority.
“I do not expect that we are going to have 19 senators and 76 members of the House come January of 2027,” Proto said. “It’s an incremental change. And how do we bring about incremental change? You bring about incremental change by changing a couple of districts.”

Mayor Justin Elicker named Assistant Chief David Zannelli to step in as acting chief. The mayor held a 6:30 press conference with the department’s three assistant chiefs to answer questions about the development. (Click here to watch a video of the press conference.)
Police officers discovered that money was missing from the confidential informant fund and told the department’s three assistant chiefs, Elicker said at a press conference held Monday evening at police headquarters at 1 Union Ave.
The assistant chiefs Monday morning confronted Jacobson, who “admitted to taking the funds for personal use,” Elicker said. The confrontation took place in the chief’s office. The assistant chiefs relayed the information to city Chief Administrative Officer Justin McCarthy, who then notified the mayor.
Elicker subsequently told Jacobson on Monday that he was going to be placed on administrative leave because of the allegation. Jacobson retired instead.
The mayor praised the officers for stepping forward: “When they saw something wrong, they did the right thing.”
“Rest assured that the process does work,” Zannelli said.

“We don’t have any information that anyone else was involved in this theft,” Elicker said.
Elicker declined to say how much money was stolen and over what time period, given the ongoing nature of an investigation into the matter.
The city informed the state’s attorney’s office, which along with state police will now determine whether and how to pursue a criminal probe.
Jacobson can retire and collect a pension, but that pension might be in jeopardy in the case of a criminal conviction, Elicker said in response to a question from the press. He noted that it’s “very early” in the matter.
Police union attorney Marshall Segar said he was disappointed by the news. “We’ll see where the investigation goes,” he said.
The mayor and chief had scheduled a 2 p.m. press conference to address Sunday’s double-fatal car crash in Westville. The press conference was cancelled moments before it was set to begin.
Jacobson became the city’s chief in July 2022 after serving in an interim capacity. He earned wide respect for his connections to people in the community on all sides of law enforcement, for his support of officers, and for his work with federal and state agencies partnering with New Haven police.
Days before he officially took over the job, his decision to provide fast, complete information about police misconduct that led to a transported suspect being hospitalized and paralyzed helped calm what could have been an explosive public crisis. That incident “opened my eyes that we needed change as a police department,” Jacobson subsequently reflected, as he pursued policy changes for handling of prisoners.
“We talk about it in dog years: Being chief [for a year] in New Haven is like seven years if you were chief somewhere else,” Jacobson reflected about the daily pace of intense developments in a 2024 radio interview.
“I remember a time six months into the job where I said, ‘Man, I don’t know if I can take this. It’s very stressful. It’s wearing on me.’ I just wanted to slow down. I wanted it to be quiet. Then I realized it’s never going to be quiet. It’s how I approach each issue.”
Jacobson has also worked to replenish the ranks of officers after years of departures.
Jacobson could not be reached for comment for this article.
Asked for comment at Monday’s full Board of Alders meeting at City Hall, Board of Alders President Tyisha Walker-Myers spoke highly of Jacobson’s tenure as police chief.
“He led the police department in a way that made me proud,” she said. “He worked along with the board when we talked about community policing, police officers who know the community. … I lived through the ’90s policing. It’s a totally different feel. We’ll be fine — no one person does it by themselves. We’ll continue doing the things that he started.”

Mark Baisley, right, seen speaking outside the Ralph L. Carr Colorado Judicial Center in Denver in December 2023, is running for a seat in the U.S. Senate. (Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)Colorado state Sen. Mark Baisley is ditching his campaign for Colorado governor to run for U.S. Senate instead. 
Baisley, a Woodland Park Republican, announced on a conservative podcast this week that he will challenge Democratic U.S. Sen. John Hickenlooper in November. He leaves behind a crowded GOP primary field for Colorado governor, where he said the electorate “will have some good choices there for moving forward with a new governor.”
“My focus is now on the United States Senate, where I frankly feel more suited,” Baisley told Brandon Wark of Free State Colorado. “I’ve been in the Legislature for seven years, this is my eighth year now, and it would be transitioning to the legislature at a bigger stage in Washington D.C. rather than in Denver, Colorado.”

Baisley is the most experienced Republican to enter the 2026 race for the Senate. Janak Joshi, a Republican former member of the Colorado House of Representatives and past candidate for Colorado’s 8th Congressional District, is also running for U.S. Senate. Other Republican candidates include Montrose County Commissioner Sean Pond, George Markert and Dathan Jones. 
Colorado state Sen. Julie Gonzales, a Denver Democrat, is also challenging Hickenlooper. Baisley said he hopes the internal battle for Democrats in the June primary will benefit his campaign. Other Democratic candidates include attorney Karen Breslin, software engineer Brashad Hasley and accountant A.J. Zimpfer.
Hickenlooper, a former Colorado governor and mayor of Denver, beat former U.S. Sen. Cory Gardner, a Republican, by 10 percentage points in the 2020 election. Hickenlooper’s campaign characterized Baisley as “too extreme for Colorado” and said he joins a group of Republican candidates campaigning to “prove who would be more loyal to Trump.”
Baisley did not respond to a request for comment from Newsline. 
Other Republican candidates running for governor include state Sen. Barbara Kirkmeyer, state Rep. Scott Bottoms, Teller County Sheriff Jason Mikesell, Bob Brinkerhoff, Jason Clark, Jon Gray-Ginsberg, Kelvin “K-Man” Wimberly and Will McBride.
Greg Lopez, who briefly represented Colorado’s 4th Congressional District in Congress following former U.S. Rep. Ken Buck’s resignation, announced Monday he will continue his campaign for governor, but as an unaffiliated candidate. 
U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet and Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser are running in the Democratic primary for governor. Colorado hasn’t had a Republican governor since Gov. Bill Owens left office after the 2006 election.

Rep. Hageman, who’s running to replace Lummis, has been mum on the military strikes and Maduro’s capture.  
The post Wyoming’s Barrasso, Lummis back Trump’s Venezuelan invasion, Hageman silent appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming’s two senior members of Congress are backing the Trump administration’s military strikes on Venezuela and the capture of the country’s leader, Nicolás Maduro. 
Republican Sens. John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis posted statements over the weekend on social media that called Maduro a “narco-terrorist” and thanked the U.S. military, which carried out the Saturday raid on Caracas. 
“Maudro is a dictator, a narco-terrorist, and an indicted criminal in the United States,” Barrasso posted on X. “Venezuela, America, and the world are safer with this dangerous dictator removed from power.”
Likewise, Lummis posted on X that she was “grateful to President Trump for his decisive leadership and to our military and law enforcement personnel who executed this operation with extraordinary courage and skill.” 
“Peace through strength works,” Lummis wrote. “Maduro will finally answer for his crimes in American courts.” 
Maduro had led Venezuela since 2013. But many countries, including the United States, refused to recognize him as a legitimate head of state. In 2024, the Biden administration accused Maduro of stealing the presidential election, citing “overwhelming evidence” that his opponent, Edmundo González Urrutia, won. 
A 2020 U.S. indictment accused Maduro of overseeing “Cartel de los Soles,” which the Trump administration has described as a violent drug organization. However, a range of specialists in Latin American criminal and narcotics issues, including former Drug Enforcement Administration officials, maintain that “Cartel de los Soles” is instead a figure of speech, dating back to the 1990s, for Venezuelan military officials corrupted by drug money. Since the 2020 indictment, both the Trump and Biden administrations offered millions in reward for information leading to his arrest. 
At least 80 people were killed, including military personnel and civilians, during the Caracas raid, the New York Times reported. No Americans were killed. Following Maduro’s removal, Trump announced the United States would “run” the country for an indefinite period.
But Venezuelan leaders gathered Monday for a swearing-in ceremony to project independence in running their country, the Associated Press reported. 
Republican Rep. Harriet Hageman, who recently announced plans to run for Senate now that Lummis is retiring, has so far not made a public statement on the invasion, via the press, press release or social media. Neither her campaign or congressional press contact responded to WyoFile’s request for comment by publishing time. 
Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray, who is running to replace Hageman in the  U.S. House, released a statement backing the invasion. 
While most conservative, congressional lawmakers have voiced support for Trump’s actions, some have raised concerns that such a strike supersedes Congress’ authority to declare war. 
“If the President believes military action against Venezuela is needed, he should make the case and Congress should vote before American lives and treasure are spent on regime change in South America,” Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Kentucky, said on the House floor last month as the chamber considered a pair of resolutions to force Trump to secure approval from Congress before attacking Venezuela. 
Both resolutions failed. Massie reposted a video of his floor comments Saturday following the raid. 
“Let’s be honest about likely outcomes. Do we truly believe that Nicolás Maduro will be replaced by a modern-day George Washington? How did that work out in Cuba, Libya, Iraq or Syria?” Massie said in his comments last month. 
The Kentucky Republican also expressed skepticism about the Trump administration’s stated motivation behind the strikes. 
“If it were about drugs, we’d bomb Mexico, or China, or Colombia,” Massie said. “And the President would not have pardoned Juan Orlando Hernández. This is about oil and regime change.”
Last month, Trump pardoned Hernández, the former Hondruan president, who had been convicted in the U.S. for helping smuggle more than 400 tons of cocaine into the country. 
“They basically said he was a drug dealer because he was the president of the country,” Trump told reporters. “And they said it was a Biden administration set-up. And I looked at the facts and I agreed with them.”

(Courtesy of Stephen Ausmus/Animal Research Services, USDA)LINCOLN — With a recent case of bird flu confirmed in a commercial flock in Nebraska’s Butler County, state officials are reminding poultry owners to monitor for and protect their birds.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Inspection Service confirmed the late December case of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) in a chicken flock of about 144,600 commercial laying hens in Butler County.
Since November, other bird flu cases have been confirmed in small backyard flocks in Keith, Howard, Washington and Scotts Bluff Counties, state ag officials said in a statement Monday.
“While these cases are not unexpected and coincide with the ongoing wild bird migration and what we are seeing in other states, it does serve as an important reminder for Nebraska poultry producers to stay vigilant in protecting their flocks,” said state veterinarian Dr. Roger Dudley. “Producers should know and monitor for HPAI symptoms and follow strict biosecurity practices, which can significantly reduce the risk of the disease affecting their flocks.”
HPAI is a highly contagious virus that spreads easily among birds through secretions, infected food, water and manure. It can spread in various ways including by equipment and on the clothing and shoes of caretakers.
Symptoms include lack of energy and appetite, decreased egg production and diarrhea. HPAI can survive for weeks in contaminated environments. It can cause sudden death in birds even if they show no other symptoms.
Resources are available for poultry producers at nda.nebraska.gov/animal/avian/ and from the USDA at https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza. Poultry showing signs of HPAI or unusual death should be reported to the NDA at 402-471-2351 or the USDA at 866-536-7593.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)The commissioner of Alaska’s Department of Family and Community Services has departed that position to take a job with the Trump administration.
Kim Kovol has accepted a job with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Gov. Mike Dunleavy announced last week. Her last day working for the state was on Friday, and Tracy Dompeling, the department’s deputy commissioner, assumed the role of acting commissioner, the statement said.
The department’s primary divisions are the Division of Juvenile Justice, the Alaska Psychiatric Institute, the Alaska Pioneer Homes and the Office of Children’s Services.
Kovol was the first commissioner of the Department of Family and Community Services, which was created in 2022. Up to then, its functions were part of the Alaska Department of Health and Social Services. Through an executive order, Dunleavy split that department into two: the Department of Health and the Department of Family and Community Services.
In his statement, Dunleavy said Kovol was a “strong and dedicated leader” for the redesigned department. “As the first Commissioner of DFCS, she built a foundation focused on service, accountability, and support for Alaska’s most vulnerable populations. I thank her for her service and wish her every success in this next role,” he said.
Kovol said she was honored to have served in that role. “I am incredibly grateful to the staff, partners, and communities who have supported our work. Together, we have made meaningful progress for Alaska families, youth, and elders, and I will always be proud of what we have accomplished,” she said in the statement.

Kovol’s last day working for the state was Jan. 2. She has taken a job with the U.S. Department of Health and Social Services.

	Kovol is the second Alaska department head to leave state service to join the Trump administration. Almost a year ago, Emma Pokon left her position as commissioner of the Department of Environmental Conservation to become the Pacific Northwest regional administrator for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
Dunleavy in May chose Randy Bates to be the department’s new commissioner. Bates was formerly director of DEC’s Division of Water.
With Kovol’s departure, there are now five state departments with leaders who currently lack legislative approval.
In addition to Bates, Dunleavy has named commissioner-designees for the Department of Law and the Department of Natural Resources. Dunleavy in August named Stephen Cox, a former U.S. attorney in Texas, as Alaska’s attorney general, replacing Treg Taylor, a Republican who is running for governor.
Dunleavy also named John Crowther, a DNR veteran, as his choice to be permanent commissioner. Crowther became acting commissioner after John Boyle resigned from the position in October.
Bates, Cox and Crowther are subject to legislative confirmation after lawmakers convene later this month for their 2026 session.
The state Department of Revenue is currently being led by an acting commissioner, Janelle Earls, who assumed the job in August after Adam Crum left the commissioner post. Crum is another Republican candidate for governor.
Dunleavy has not yet named his choices for the commissioner posts at the Department of Revenue or the Department of Family and Community Services, said Jeff Turner, the governor’s spokesperson. Earls and Dompeling are currently acting commissioners and it is not clear whether the governor will name commissioner-designees for those positions, he said.
Dunleavy is in the last year of his second term. He is term limited and may not run for reelection.

White, a Republican and one of the most powerful government officials in the state, held the closed-door press conference inside his office at the Capitol. White conducted a question-and-answer session with numerous members of the media about the 2026 legislative session that begins Tuesday, according to a press release obtained by Mississippi Today. 
The decision by the speaker’s office followed a Mississippi Today exclusive report in April that White, his staff and some of their spouses were treated to a trip to the 2025 Super Bowl by a sports-gambling company. After that story was published, Mississippi Today was removed from the speaker’s press distribution list, and his office stopped responding to requests for comment 
But Monday marked the first time that Mississippi Today, a credentialed member of the Capitol Press Corps and the largest newsroom outlet in the state, was denied access to a press event in the speaker’s office attended by numerous media organizations. 
Minutes before the press conference started, Tammy Cowart, White’s assistant, emerged from his office with a clipboard and asked reporters if they had been invited. When Cowart asked a Mississippi Today reporter which news outlet he worked for, she said she would need to check with other staffers before letting him inside.  
“They sent out an exclusive invitation out to attend this. If you’re not on my list, I’ll just have to check, because you’re not on there,” Cowart said. 
She then said the event was not a press conference, but a “specific Q&A.”
The event was not an exclusive interview. Numerous media organizations attended, including print, broadcast and radio outlets.  
Cowart then returned to the speaker’s office and came out again minutes later to inform Mississippi Today’s reporter that he would not be allowed into the press conference. 
“I checked, and it’s not an open press conference. It’s invitation only. You’re not on my list, you didn’t get the invitation, so you won’t be allowed in,” Cowart said. 
Cowart said other news outlets were also not invited to the press event, but declined to say which ones. 
A press release announcing the event and reviewed by Mississippi Today, said “only media directly receiving the media advisory” would be invited to attend. 
“Mississippi Today is the largest newsroom in the state, and our journalists are careful to cover the news accurately and with context,” Mississippi Today Editor-in-Chief Emily Wagster Pettus, who covered the Mississippi Legislature for 31 years for The Clarion-Ledger and The Associated Press, said in a statement Monday. 
“We and other news organizations are the eyes and ears of the public at the state Capitol,” she said. “It is petty and wrong for Speaker Jason White — or any other elected official — to cut off media access.”
Layne Bruce, executive director of the Mississippi Press Association, said in a statement Monday that White’s office should “treat all press outlets fairly.”
“We would urge the speaker’s office to open its doors and allow representatives from all press outlets to be included,” Bruce said. “We believe that in the spirit of transparency, and since this is taking place in a public building that is funded by the taxpayers, it is only proper.” 
Bruce also pointed out that Mississippi Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann, also a Republican, took questions about his legislative agenda from media outlets, including Mississippi Today, at a luncheon just hours before the event in White’s office. 
The denial of press access in Mississippi comes amid broader tensions between the federal government and the press. Under the Trump administration, the White House has restricted Associated Press journalists from certain presidential press events after the outlet refused to adopt administration-preferred language, a move the AP has described as retaliatory and a violation of press freedoms. Separately, the Pentagon has altered press access rules, prompting concern from major news organizations that new restrictions limit independent coverage.
In a statement to the Clarion Ledger, White said: “The Media Q+A hosted in my office today was an invitation-only media opportunity, not an open, public press conference.” 
Charlie Mitchell, an attorney and former newspaper editor who has taught media law at the University of Mississippi, said White’s decision raised questions about whether the speaker has complied with the First Amendment.
“The speaker may have been thinking about his complete discretion when it comes to interviews and responding to inquiries, Mitchell said. “If, for instance, he wanted to return a phone call to one journalist and not another, that’s perfectly OK. Press events are very different.”
The scenario could parallel a federal court decision in favor of the AP, which “made clear the First Amendment does not allow officials to exclude credentialed journalists from otherwise open press events.”
Mississippi Today received an audio recording of the speaker’s press conference from multiple organizations that attended the event. The news outlet reported on the speaker’s comments along with those made hours earlier by Hosemann on the 2026 legislative session. 
Taylor Spillman, White’s spokesperson, did not respond to multiple questions sent via text message and email about the decision by the speaker’s office to bar Mississippi Today from its press conference and remove it from its media distribution list. 
Spillman and Cowart were both photographed on the trip to the 2025 Super Bowl with White. DraftKings, a sports gambling giant pushing for the legalization of mobile sports betting in Mississippi, confirmed with Mississippi Today that the gambling industry paid for the game-day tickets.  
Mississippi Speaker of the House Jason White, some staff and spouses attended the Super Bowl.
Spillman and her husband, Trey Spillman, documented Super Bowl festivities on social media.
A day after the Super Bowl, Trey Spillman took to social media to thank DraftKings for the experience. 
“Unforgettable experience at Super Bowl LIX. Thank you @draftkings for the hospitality! #sports”
But after Mississippi Today asked the Spillmans about the trip, the social media post was changed to remove any mention of DraftKings and the company’s “hospitality.” 
“Unforgettable experience at Super Bowl LIX. #sports,” the edited post reads. 
The sports gambling lobby, as it has done in other states, has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on Mississippi politicians trying to convince them to legalize mobile sports betting. 
The issue is likely to become another priority for the House this legislative session.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/07125657/Jason-White-2.jpg,,,2026-01-05 19:11:43.704027

(U.S. Coast Guard photo, Courtesy Clean Gulf Associates)The Trump administration has assessed what it’s calling the largest civil fine ever for an offshore oil spill in 2023 off the Louisiana coast.
The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration sent notice Dec. 31 to Panther Operating Co. of Houston that it has proposed a $9.62 million fine for the failure of its Main Pass Oil Gathering pipeline system. An estimated 1.1 million gallons of crude oil leaked into the Gulf of Mexico when a connector on the pipeline malfunctioned, allowing oil to flow for more than nine hours, according to the agency. The leak was visible nearly 20 miles off the Mississippi River Delta. 
Panther Operating Co., a subsidiary of Third Coast infrastructure, has 30 days to respond to the notice to explain how it will address the leak, contest the allegations or request a formal administrative hearing. Company representatives did not respond immediately to a request for comment Monday. 
According to the notice, a Panther controller was aware of the leak at 7:30 p.m. Nov. 15 based on pressure gauge observations and noted a zero flow rate for the pipeline five hours later. However, the controller did not order the pipeline shut down before his shift ended the next morning at 6:00. His replacement called for it to be closed around 6:30 a.m., which was 13 hours after the pressure issues were first noted, the agency said.
No new or continuous oil flow was reported after Nov. 21, 2023.  
The U.S. Coast Guard, the federal Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, the Louisiana Oil Spill Coordinator’s Office and the state Department of Wildlife and Fisheries conducted response and cleanup activities after the spill until April 2024.
The notice from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration said Panther Operating Co. failed to account for underwater landslides and tropical storm impacts on the Gulf seabed in its maintenance of the pipeline. 
“PHMSA’s focus on safety and holding operators accountable when they fail to comply with federal safety regulations will never change,” PHMSA Administrator Paul Roberti said in a news release. “It is important for pipeline operators to remain vigilant in their operations to prevent these types of failures or there will be serious consequences.”

His keen understanding of sports, deep journalistic connections to coaches and athletes and conversational storytelling style have won Cleveland legions of admirers during his 60-year career. This is the 15th time he has been named sportswriter of the year – more than anyone in the state.
In announcing its awards Monday, the association also named Ross Dellenger, senior college football reporter for Yahoo Sports, as the 2025 National Sportswriter of the Year.
This is the first such honor for Dellenger, who grew up in Biloxi. He is a graduate of Mississippi State University and a former sportswriter for the Clarion Ledger. Dellenger started working for Sports Illustrated in 2018 and moved to Yahoo Sports in 2023.
Cleveland is a Hattiesburg native and University of Southern Mississippi graduate. He has worked for the Hattiesburg American; the Monroe News Star World in Louisiana; the Jackson Daily News and The Clarion-Ledger as a reporter, editor and columnist.
He has been Mississippi Today’s sports columnist since 2016. He and his son, sportswriter Tyler Cleveland, host the Mississippi Today podcast “Crooked Letter Sports.”

Rick Cleveland is in Arizona this week to continue covering the most successful football season in Ole Miss history. The Rebels play Miami on Thursday in a college football playoff semifinal in the Fiesta Bowl, with the winner advancing to next week’s national championship game.
During the past few weeks, Cleveland has thoroughly covered the Ole Miss coaching turmoil, as Lane Kiffin departed for rival LSU, defensive coordinator Pete Golding was named the Rebels’ new head coach and Ole Miss defeated higher-ranked Georgia in the Sugar Bowl on New Year’s Day.
His columns over the past year include a sharply-worded piece about the obscene amounts of money that college coaches continue collecting after they’re fired; an insightful description of how former NFL player Tommy Kelly became the head football coach at Jackson’s Lanier High School and led the Bulldogs to their best season in years; and thorough coverage of Mississippi’s only PGA tournament, the Sanderson Farms Championship.
Cleveland is a member of both the Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame and the Mississippi Press Association Hall of Fame, and he is from a family of sportswriters. His late brother, Bobby Cleveland, was a longtime outdoors writer for The Clarion-Ledger.
Rick and Bobby Cleveland developed a love of sports from their father, Ace Cleveland, who was a reporter and sports editor for the Hattiesburg American and Jackson Daily News before serving as sports information director for the University of Southern Mississippi from 19655 to 1986.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/06194106/rick-featured.jpg,,,2026-01-05 19:11:43.704027
