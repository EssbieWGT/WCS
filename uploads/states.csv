A Senate committee advanced a bill that would ban gender transition surgery, hormone therapy and puberty-blocking drugs for minors Thursday. (Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — A group of adults, children and their parents dropped a case challenging a South Carolina law that bars all gender transition treatments for youth and prevents state-funded health plans from covering procedures for adults.
Last week’s decision by attorneys for the American Civil Liberties Union ended a lawsuit filed in August 2024.
It argued a law signed three months earlier violated transgender South Carolinians’ constitutional right to equal protection by denying them the same access to health care as peers whose hormones and surgeries are covered.
“This was a heartbreaking decision, and the legal team remains committed to the rights of transgender and non-binary South Carolinians and their access to gender affirming medical care,” ACLU spokesperson Paul Bowers said in a statement, declining to elaborate further on why the attorneys made the decision.
Last year’s debate in the Statehouse focused on stopping puberty blockers and other hormone therapy for minors, but the law ultimately limited options even for adults with private insurance.
That’s due to a line in the law that bans public funds from paying “directly or indirectly for gender transition procedures.” Since the Medical University of South Carolina receives state funds, it stopped offering all treatments regardless of a patient’s age or health plan.
U.S. Supreme Court upholds Tennessee prohibition on transgender medical care for minors

The ACLU’s decision follows actions by the U.S. Supreme Court.
In June, justices upheld a similar law in Tennessee that bans gender transition treatments for transgender youth. At the time, ACLU attorneys said that 6-3 ruling would not end their fight against South Carolina’s law.
They argued Tennessee’s law was narrower because it didn’t impact transgender adults. According to GOP sponsors of South Carolina’s law, the line on public funds was meant to block coverage by Medicaid and the state health plan for government employees, though MUSC’s decision affected adults statewide.
Then in late June, justices asked the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals to reconsider its decision requiring government-funded health plans in North Carolina and West Virginia to cover transgender treatments and surgeries.
Specifically, the lower court’s ruling applied to North Carolina’s state health insurance plan and West Virginia’s Medicaid program.
Because of the similarity between those cases and the South Carolina lawsuit, U.S. District Judge Richard Gergel put the Palmetto State case on pause until the appeals court issued a new decision considering the precedent set by the U.S. Supreme Court’s Tennessee ruling.
As of Monday, the lower court had yet to do so.
But the ACLU attorneys opted not to wait any longer. They reversed course and informed Gergel in a one-sentence filing that the plaintiffs wanted to dismiss the lawsuit.
The office of Attorney General Alan Wilson contends the ACLU’s attorneys recognized they would ultimately lose.
Lawsuit seeks to block South Carolina law limiting transgender medical care options

The Supreme Court ruling made it clear that the Constitution’s Equal Protection Clause doesn’t extend to gender transition treatments for transgender people, the office wrote in legal filings.
Because of that, South Carolina is allowed to draw the line as to what gender transition treatments it will or won’t cover without court interference, the office argued.
“I am proud to aggressively defend South Carolina’s law and will continue to do so if necessary,” Wilson said in a statement Monday.
Senate Medical Affairs Chairman Danny Verdin, who sponsored the Senate’s version of the bill that became law, said he was glad to see the lawsuit dropped.
“The ACLU would be wise to stop pushing taxpayer-funded gender transitions for children, but if they don’t, South Carolina stands ready to fight for truth and common sense,” the Laurens Republican said in a statement.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_7613-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-10-13 18:57:21.812146

(Screenshot via Brown University press call)Peter Howitt was shocked, a little confused, and had no celebratory champagne in his fridge when he found out Monday morning he had won a Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences. 
The retired Brown University professor’s phone was off, its battery depleted overnight. Only through an enterprising Swedish journalist who obtained Howitt’s wife’s number did the Canada-born economist learn of Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences’ decision to award him half a Nobel for his work with French economist Philippe Aghion.
“At first I thought, ‘This is some kind of a hoax,’ but after I asked her a few questions, it became clear that this was for real,” said Howitt, 79, who taught at Brown from 2000 through 2013, after which he gained emeritus status. “It was only about, oh, perhaps three quarters of an hour later that the Swedish Academy managed to get through to me.”
The Ivy League university shared the story over a Zoom press call early Monday afternoon with Howitt and Brown leadership. Howitt fielded questions from reporters in places as diverse as South Korea, Canada and Rhode Island about his work in what the Swedish Academy labeled “the theory of sustained growth through creative destruction.” 
The other half of this year’s Nobel in economic theory will go to Joel Mokyr of Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, who has worked on related ideas in theories of economic growth. The prizes are scheduled to be awarded during a ceremony in Stockholm on Dec. 10. 
Howitt shares his victory with Aghion, who teaches at the Collège de France, INSEAD and the London School of Economics. In 1992, Aghion and Howitt co-authored a new model of creative destruction, a concept introduced by Joseph Schumpeter in his 1942 book, “Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy.” The Austrian economist’s tome joins the likes of Karl Marx’s “Capital” and Adam Smith’s “The Wealth of Nations” as among the most cited books in the social sciences published before 1950.
Howitt summarized Schumpeter’s “simple idea” for reporters: “In order to understand technological progress, you have to understand that it takes place through waves of innovation that bring great benefits … but also generate tremendous losses to many people whose technology, whose livelihood depends upon technologies and capital that are rendered obsolete by these new technologies,” Howitt said.
Howitt and Aghion dealt with the phenomenon in a new way by creating a mathematically coherent model, which the economist said allowed for more empirical analysis of the way progress and stagnation work in economic growth and industry.
‘Escape-competition effect’
Howitt and Aghion zeroed in on how previous innovators can then delay future improvements to maintain their position on top. 
“I’m thrilled that the world at large is beginning to acknowledge the importance of that conflict,” Howitt said. “The central thing that we focus on is that new technologies are brought in by disruptive outsiders who are interested in shaking up the status quo. If they succeed in doing that, they become the status quo.”
Schumpeter’s application of the theory was gentler on monopolies, Howitt noted, while he and Aghion prefer the “escape-competition effect,” which details how existing industry leaders in some spaces often “find it easier to suppress competition and to escape competition.” 
That’s why innovation needs “not to be blocked by the people who used to be innovators, but are now quite reactionary,” Howitt said. “This requires a lot of attention, by antitrust policy, by competition policy, by international trade policy.”  
Howitt and Aghion’s 1992 paper has been cited by 4,421 subsequent papers, according to the database EconPapers. But there was a time when Howitt was unsure whether the paper would get published at all, he said, despite Aghion’s constant encouragement that the duo might win a Nobel some day.  
“It took us five years to get it published,” Howitt said. “It just did not meet with a good reception.”
Howitt and Aghion’s research remains a hotly discussed staple of economics theory, with entire volumes devoted to examining the theory’s viability. The National Bureau of Economic Research produced a working paper in 2017, for example, that argued existing firms’ improvements to their product lines were more important for economic growth than true creative destruction. 


 A dyed in the wool economist 
Asked by reporters about AI, Howitt did not take a Chicken Little stance.
“The fact is that throughout history, there have been all sorts of great general purpose technologies that have come about which people have predicted are going to generate mass unemployment, and that’s the sort of the end of the ability of anyone to earn a living through their work,” Howitt said. “But it hasn’t happened. Mass unemployment is always predicted for new technologies, and typically it doesn’t happen.”
That’s because new technologies make workers “more productive,” Howitt said, and it’s not usual for economic growth, technological change, and the value of labor to proceed in totally opposite directions.
But, Howitt added, “It’s going to have to be regulated…Private incentives in an unregulated market are not really going to resolve this conflict in a way that’s best for society.”
Howitt said his interest in economics began when he was a teenager working for a wool importer in his hometown of Guelph, Ontario, which sold wares to textile mills in the province as well as Quebec. Howitt recalled his fascination with the business’ teletype terminal that hummed throughout the workday, “bringing in prices of wool from around the world.”  










Mass unemployment is always predicted for new technologies, and typically it doesn’t happen. 


– Brown University Professor Emeritus Peter Howitt


Howitt’s boss, who the economist described as “a real mentor,” told the young man he’d have to study economics if he wanted to understand why the prices of different kinds of wool shot up and down over the course of a day.  
“He started to explain something about supply and demand to me, and that sounded really interesting,” Howitt said, who went on to study economics and political science at McGill University in Montreal. As an undergraduate and then graduate student, Howitt acquired a taste for macroeconomics, and his doctoral thesis at Northwestern University focused on the appropriately macro theme of monetary dynamics.    
“But I never turned back from that original question that I made of my boss back when I was about 18 years old, ‘Why are these prices going up and down?’” Howitt added.
Cass Cliatt, Brown’s senior vice president for communications who emceed the press event, closed by congratulating Howitt and added, “We hope you do find that champagne.” 
“My wife just got back from the store,” Howitt replied, “so she’s got something.”

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderFormer Democratic state representative turned Trump supporter Vernon Jones has launched a bid for Georgia’s secretary of state.
Jones is the fourth Republican candidate to declare a run to be the state’s top election official, joining state Rep. Tim Fleming; Kelvin King, a former candidate for U.S. Senate; and former state elections official Gabriel Sterling. A primary will be held in May 2026.
In his campaign announcement, Jones positioned himself as someone who is capable of “restoring faith in democracy,” arguing elections have been “shaken” for too long.
“We need a Secretary of State who will fight for paper ballots, limit mail-in voting, and enforce strong voter ID laws, because election integrity starts with common sense,” Jones said in his announcement video.
The Georgia Secretary of State oversees elections, grants business licenses and manages the state’s securities market. The office, currently held by Brad Raffensperger, gained attention after the 2020 election when Raffensperger, a Republican, refused to overturn the results despite pressure from President Donald Trump during his first run for a second term.
Jones touted his alliance with Trump in his Monday announcement, saying that he’ll stand “shoulder-to-shoulder with President Trump in the fight for election integrity.” Jones said in a press release that he’ll “make Georgia the model for American First election integrity” as he campaigns across the state.
“I never wavered, and I never will. My loyalty is to the people of Georgia and to President Trump’s America First movement,” Jones said in a press release.
Jones stepped into the national spotlight in 2020 as an outspoken supporter of Trump, snagging a speaker slot at that year’s Republican National Convention. And the lifelong Democrat became a Republican darling among the Trump faithful after the former president demanded Gov. Brian Kemp resign for refusing to overturn his narrow 2020 Georgia election loss to President Joe Biden.
Jones launched a short-lived campaign for governor in 2022 before jumping in the race for Georgia’s 10th Congressional District with Trump’s endorsement. Jones finished second, losing to now-Congressman Mike Collins. 
As CEO of DeKalb County, Jones faced allegations of misconduct toward women. 
Penny Brown Reynolds, an ex-Biden administration appointee and former Fulton County state judge, and voting rights advocate Adrian Consonery Jr. are running for the Democratic ticket.

The New Mexico Finance Authority approved more than $50 million in housing loans for developers, the executive director said recently. (Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)The leader of the New Mexico Finance Authority on Friday said the authority has already approved more than one-third of $125 million in housing-related loans, which were a key part of the Legislature’s “historic” housing spending in 2024.
NMFA CEO Marquita Russel provided an update on the status of the authority’s loan fund Friday during a presentation to an interim legislative committee. Lawmakers in 2024 approved nearly $200 million in new housing-related spending, citing a growing shortage and homelessness crisis.
The Legislature made a change during the authority’s Opportunity Enterprise Revolving Loan Fund, allowing the authority to award housing loans, and it gave the authority $125 million to loan out. 
The fund offers low-interest loans to help developers break ground on either middle-income housing projects, which Russel referred to as “workforce housing,” or affordable housing infrastructure, including water, electrical or other utilities. 
Legislature and governor tout ‘largest one-time investment in housing’ during 2024 session 

Its first round of funding began in September 2024. Since then, the authority has approved about $52 million in two rounds of funding, and it has set aside about $50 million for a third round. 
“So there’s not a lot available for round four. It depends largely on how round three pencils out,” she said.
The funding has gone to projects in Bernalillo, Doña Ana, Otero, Santa Fe, Taos and Valencia counties, she told lawmakers. 
Among the “workforce housing” projects she described are townhomes in Taos, the Santa Fe Midtown project and military housing in Alamogordo.
As for affordable housing infrastructure, she listed the San Roque and San Mateo Manor apartment projects in Albuquerque, among others. 
In total, statewide developers asked for nearly $200 million in loans across three rounds, she said. The authority can offer loans up to $15 million per recipient at 60% of the current Wall Street Journal prime rate, which means about 4.35%, as of Monday.
In addition to the loans, the Legislature in 2024 approved $20 million on homelessness initiatives and $50 million for the New Mexico Mortgage Finance Authority, which recently rebranded as Housing New Mexico.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/IMG_9539-1024x964.jpg,,,2025-10-13 18:57:21.812146

Terry Rogers and Rick Jasperse on March 20, 2014. Photo via Georgia House Media ServicesColleagues of state Rep. Mandi Ballinger say they’ll remember her as a woman with a heart for Georgia’s children, a mind for parsing intricate laws and the guts to stand up for what she believed in.
Ballinger, a Canton Republican, died Sunday after a long battle with cancer, according to an announcement from House Speaker Jon Burns.
Before she was elected to the state House in 2012, Ballinger started her career working in a domestic violence shelter and went on to work for a district attorney’s office as a victim advocate.
State leaders said she brought her passion for serving the vulnerable to the state Capitol.
“Representative Ballinger’s highest priority as a legislator was helping Georgia’s young people affected by our state juvenile justice system,” said House Speaker Pro Tem Jan Jones, a Milton Republican, in a text. “Her serious, steely manner masked a soft and caring heart. These qualities made her a formidable force when she felt legislators or advocates crossed her high standards in her committee.”
“Personally, she was my friend and a devoted mother to her son, Henry,” Jones added. “He was her light while she made Georgia a brighter place for our children.”
Ballinger was chair of the House Judiciary Juvenile Committee. Jasper Republican state Rep. Rick Jasperse, who shared an office with Ballinger at the Capitol, said she had a rare combination of passion for the subject matter and the intellect to craft legislation.
“The legal world around children is pretty darn complex,” Jasperse said. “We’d be in our office some evenings, and she’s trying to explain some complex matter about this legal thing, and much of the time my eyes were rolled back in my head, but she knew it, and she knew the outcome that she wanted to make. When she brought a bill to the House floor, she didn’t have to do a whole lot of explaining, because people trusted her. She had already done her explaining in the committees and to people that needed to know, and people trusted her that she was going to do the right thing.”
Ballinger’s idea of the right thing sometimes put her at odds with other conservatives. That includes her support for a bill to divert some 17-year-olds accused of crimes from state superior court to juvenile court, which she championed for years but didn’t get passed into law.
Jasperse said Ballinger didn’t shy away from speaking her mind, and he’ll miss the spirited debates Ballinger had with him and others in their office suite.
“In our world, we had been there a while, and so we like really getting into subjects and learning about them and debating them, especially in small office situations – why you’re right, why you’re wrong – it’s entertaining,” he said. “She was really good at debate because she understood her stuff so well.”
In addition to her work for children and crime victims, Ballinger was an ardent backer of gun rights. She was lead sponsor of a 2022 bill signed by Gov. Brian Kemp that expanded firearm license reciprocity and allowed people with permits from other states to carry legally in Georgia.
Ballinger put her debate skills to use in committee meeting rooms, said Concord Republican state Rep. Beth Camp.
“She was a master at holding a committee meeting,” Camp said. “She understood parliamentary procedure and she was such a wonderful teacher on how to run a committee meeting where it was productive and people were still able to speak and all voices could be heard.”
Camp, who was elected in 2020, said she and other women legislators saw Ballinger as a mentor, a role she was happy to fill.
“There’s not a lot of other women that serve in the General Assembly, especially Republican women,” Camp said. “She was willing to take the time, and she took a genuine interest in me, and I appreciated that so much.”
“She was so wonderful to many people, and she never sought the spotlight,” she added. “That just was never her style, but she always wanted to let people know that they had a support system and if she liked you, she would fight for you, and so I was very honored that she fought for me.”
Camp said she is inspired by Ballinger’s commitment to public service, even while she was suffering health challenges.
“Even though she’d been battling cancer ever since I knew her, that was not the definition of who she was,” Camp said. “She was a mother, fearlessly loving Henry, her son, and she kept going. A lot of people would have stepped back some, but not her. She was elected by the people in her district. She continued to fight for them and to fight for the people of Georgia to the end. To the very end.”

California-based Radiant Industries cited the state's ban on spent nuclear fuel waste and said it will build a manufacturing plant in Tennessee.
The post Radiant scraps Wyoming nuclear microreactor manufacturing facility appeared first on WyoFile .","Radiant Industries has scrapped its proposal to build a nuclear microreactor manufacturing facility outside the Natrona County town of Bar Nunn and announced it plans to build “its first mass-produced Kaleidos microreactor” facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, “on a Manhattan Project site.”
The announcement came Monday afternoon in the form of a letter-to-the-editor from Radiant Senior Director of Operations Matt Wilson and a press release announcing the company’s new focus on building the facility in Tennessee. The company cited Wyoming’s decades-long ban on storing spent nuclear fuel waste.
“Our decision came down to regulatory certainty,” Wilson said. “Our plan was to build our nuclear generators in the Cowboy State, using Wyoming-mined uranium, send them to customers (like our troops at remote bases), and bring them back for refueling, with the used fuel being safely and temporarily stored in above-ground containers at our factory.”
Wyoming lawmakers made a narrow exception to the state ban in 2022 to accommodate TerraPower’s Natrium nuclear plant being built near Kemmerer. That exception allows nuclear power plants operating in the state to “temporarily” store their own radioactive waste. But it doesn’t allow waste from nuclear power plants outside the state.

Nuclear energy supporters have backed, without success, several proposals in recent years to make more exceptions to accommodate other nuclear waste storage proposals, such as Radiant’s. A legislative committee tabled such a measure in July.
“Radiant was only seeking to safely and temporarily store used fuel from Wyoming-built reactors returned from deployment,” Wilson wrote. “Sadly, Wyoming’s law currently does not accommodate that model.”
California-based Radiant also faced significant opposition within Bar Nunn and beyond, mostly due to its plan to store spent nuclear fuel at the manufacturing facility — which would have been located close to Casper, Wyoming’s second-largest city. Though the company found many supporters, as well as many others who were on the fence seeking details and assurances regarding safety, a group formed to oppose Radiant’s Bar Nunn proposal and began collecting signatures. 
“Bar Nunn does not want nuclear waste,” Midwest Republican Rep. Bill Allemand told a crowd of about 200 in July during a meeting he organized in Bar Nunn. “We want manufacturing. We would love for Radiant to come here and manufacture and put the waste somewhere else.”

Retired Wyoming uranium miner Wayne Heili, who recently held a “nuclear 101” presentation at Casper College and generally supports nuclear energy proposals in the state, told WyoFile he is disappointed. 
The Legislature’s Minerals, Business and Economic Development Committee, he said, “had an opportunity earlier this year to move something forward, and they didn’t. That left Radiant looking at uncertainty.
“It’s a sad outcome for business development in Wyoming,” Heili added. “That’s the legacy of nuclear, though. No matter where you are, somebody’s going to show some concern.”
Green River Republican Sen. Scott Heiner, who co-chairs the Interim Minerals Committee, said Radiant pressured lawmakers to move too quickly to change state law to accommodate its plans, noting that most lawmakers only learned of the company’s proposal earlier this year.
“They’ve made their decision before we’ve had a chance to go through the whole legislative cycle,” Heiner told WyoFile on Monday. “We took public testimony, we tabled the decision until later, and they’ve decided to go.”
Heiner added, “They’ve held that over our head for the whole time: ‘If you don’t approve this, then we’re going to go to Tennessee.’ Well, something that huge, you don’t rush it.”

“It has become clear to me that I can help President Trump in other ways that are more effective than being in the U.S. House,” Blum said in a news release. “I love our country, and despite our challenges I remain optimistic that under the President’s leadership, America’s best days are still to come.”
Blum, a 70-year-old Dubuque resident, had launched his campaign Sept. 18. The former CEO and president of Eagle Point Software previously served in Congress representing northeast Iowa from his initial 2014 election until he lost to former U.S. Rep. Abby Finkenauer, a Democrat, in the 2018 midterm election.
Seeking a return to Washington, D.C., Blum announced he would support his campaign with a personal $250,000 investment. He was running for the seat currently held by Republican U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson, who in turn is running for the U.S. Senate. Incumbent Sen. Joni Ernst announced she will not seek reelection in 2026.
There are several other Republicans still in the race to become the GOP candidate in Iowa’s 2nd Congressional District. Iowa Rep. Shannon Lundgren, R-Peosta; state Sen. Charlie McClintock, R-Alburnett, and former state lawmaker Joe Mitchell all also announced their campaigns for the nomination in September.
Three Democrats are also running for the seat: Iowa Rep. Lindsay James, D-Dubuque; Clint Twedt-Ball, the founder of the nonprofit Matthew 25, and Kathy Dolter, the former dean of nursing at Kirkwood Community College.
Political forecasters predict the 2026 race for the 2nd Congressional District is likely to be less competitive than other Iowa races. But following Hinson’s announcement that she would leave the race, Cook Political Report shifted the rating for the seat from “solid Republican” to “likely Republican” in 2026.

SB 164 would not allow civil suits to be brought against medical personnel providing assistive reproductive technology, or procedures that involve the handling of human eggs, sperm, and embryos to help achieve pregnancy.
Neither could lawsuits be filed against a patient seeking reproductive assistance.
Grall filed similar legislation last year but that bill faced opposition from powerful Sen. Kathleen Passidomo, the former Senate president and chair of the Rules Committee. Passidomo took issue with the bill’s definition of “unborn child” as a “member of the species Homo sapiens, at any stage of development, who is carried in the womb.”
The 2026 version of the bill uses the same definition of unborn child.
Senate Republicans criticize bill establishing wrongful death of fetuses

The second proposal, HB 6001, was filed by Boca Raton House Democrat Kelly Skidmore. That bill would eliminate from statute the “Florida Pregnancy Support Services Program,” established in 2005 as an initiative of then-Gov. Jeb Bush with the Legislature agreeing to appropriate $2 million for its operations. 
In 2018, the Legislature codified the program into statute passing HB 41.
Now the program is housed in the Department of Health and legislators have agreed in the current year state budget to allocate $29.5 million to help it operate.
Skidmore argues that the program is no longer needed because of the state’s six-week abortion ban which, for the most part, bans terminations before many patients know they are pregnant.

“When we live in a state that has a six-week ban, how many crisis pregnancies do you think there are that we still need to fund $29.5 million for these centers?” Skidmore asked. “What crisis pregnancies are they helping with? There aren’t any, because there are no options for pregnant women. So, this is just false. All of it is false and a misuse of taxpayer dollars.”
HB 6001 doesn’t have a Senate companion because it is a “repealer bill.” Florida House Speaker Daniel Perez implemented a rule allowing representatives to file one repealer bill per session that does not count toward their seven-bill limit.
Skidmore said she took advantage of the opportunity.
“And what surprises me is that the emphasis on the new DOGE office has not raised this as a red flag of inappropriate spending of taxpayer dollars, particularly since there was a recent news story that the lawyer that represents many of these networks gave advice to not provide ultrasounds to pregnant women suspected of having an ectopic pregnancy because it was a high risk of being sued,” Skidmore said, referencing a Massachusetts lawsuit.
Meanwhile, the most recent available data show that during state fiscal year 2022-23, 21,372 women were provided 132,395 counseling services and 18,238 pregnancy tests were provided by the centers.

In 2022, New Mexico voters overwhelmingly affirmed this mission by passing a constitutional amendment for early childhood funding. Now, we’re setting our sights even higher. Because of over a decade of advocacy from families, organizers, educators, and community leaders, with bold leadership from Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and the state Legislature, we’ll be the first state in the nation to offer free child care to all families, regardless of income.
This proposal will bring generational economic relief to thousands of New Mexico families and improve wages for our early childhood educators, who are the backbone of our state’s child care system. Bold investments in our families and children pay back dividends, but it’s important we iron out the details with input from providers, educators, families, and our communities.
We commend the Early Childhood Education and Care Department (ECECD) for proposing increased reimbursement rates for providers that pay their workers a more livable wage. This is a values-driven use of our state budget during a time when federal support programs for families and children are under attack, but it’s only a temporary fix.
In partnership with stakeholders from across the state, the ECECD developed a comprehensive wage and career ladder, which establishes a robust wage scale that increases early childhood workers’ wages based on their level of experience and education. This plan will ensure our state retains and attracts more high-quality workers and meets the current and future needs of New Mexico’s families and children. The best part is, it already has the support of child care business owners, workers, and advocates.
A recent child care gap analysis found a shortfall of almost 14,000 child care slots in 2024, with the most significant gaps in Lea, Eddy, Santa Fe, Sandoval and Bernalillo counties. In November, as free child care eligibility expands, we can expect to see the demand for slots rise even more. The ECECD’s strategy to increase supply through home-based providers and incentivizing higher wages is the right way to go. A comprehensive wage and career ladder will ensure that those gains can be retained and grow in the future.
While New Mexico builds out child care capacity, we must also make sure that our families with the greatest need come first. When free child care was expanded to include New Mexico families at or below 400% of the federal poverty level, there were fewer child care slots utilized by those with the lowest household income. When the state removes income requirements next month, it must keep a close eye on enrollment data so that those with the most need are not left behind.
To ensure quality care for all families, the providers who make it possible must have the resources and support to provide safe and healthy environments, along with competitive wages to attract and keep skilled educators. We strongly support the ECECD’s strategy for recruiting and supporting smaller, home-based providers. This will be especially critical in rural and tribal communities, where they are often the backbone of care.
Our vision in New Mexico is clear: universal, affordable, high-quality child care for all families; well-paid educators; and a system grounded in equity and justice. Now, we all have a role to play in making sure the system delivers on its promise for families, providers, and most of all, for our children.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/242533085_187573036792822_256662930739931601_n-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-13 17:58:38.001534

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)A proposed electric rate increase would cost North Dakota State University about $1 million a year, a representative of the college told utility regulators Monday. 
Northern States Power Co., part of Xcel Energy, has asked the North Dakota Public Service Commission to approve a rate increase of more than 19%, or $22.34 per month for an average residential customer. 
Xcel Energy’s requested rate increase would affect parts of Fargo, including the NDSU campus.
“NDSU projects that our annual electrical costs would rise by over $1 million,” Brent DeKrey, director of facilities management at NDSU, testified from Fargo at a PSC hearing Monday. 
DeKrey said such a large increase could mean increased tuition and fees for students, reduced resources for research at NDSU and additional costs passed along to the state’s taxpayers. 
Minnesota-based Xcel has about 97,000 customers in North Dakota. The proposed rate hike would increase Xcel’s annual revenue in the state by $44.6 million. 
The PSC also took testimony from people in Grand Forks and Minot, which are also served by Xcel, as well as from the Capitol in Bismarck. 
Xcel’s coal exit an issue in North Dakota electric rate case 

A point of discussion in the rate case is Xcel’s move away from coal to generate electricity. 
Xcel last year retired one of three coal units at the Sherburne County Generating Plant, or Sherco, near Monticello, Minnesota. It plans to retire Sherco’s remaining coal-fired units in 2026 and 2030, marking the company’s full exit from coal. Xcel has invested in solar and wind energy and continues to rely on nuclear power plants.
There was little discussion of Sherco on Monday and whether the move away from coal was driving up rates, as Victor Schock, director of utilities for the PSC, has said. 
Alex Nisbet, regulatory policy specialist for Xcel Energy, said that the Sherco impact was “being reviewed at great length” in the case.
Utility companies seeking a rate increase in North Dakota often reach a settlement with the PSC for less than the initial request. 
North Dakota Xcel customers have been paying a higher rate since February, about half the requested increase. 
Nisbet said final rates often end up close to the interim rate. 
Asked if Xcel anticipates moving away from natural gas like it has coal, Nisbet said Xcel plans to build a new natural gas combustion turbine in Minnesota with plans for others. 
WBI Energy is developing a pipeline to bring natural gas from western North Dakota, where it is a byproduct of oil production, to the east. 
“That’s a project that excites us a lot,” he said. 
The PSC held a second public input session Monday evening. The public also can submit comments on the rate case by emailing ndpsc@nd.gov or by mail to: Public Service Commission, 600 E. Boulevard Ave., Dept. 408, Bismarck, ND 58505.
The PSC has set a formal hearing to begin Dec. 1.

Gretchen Whitmer (center) holds up signed legislative pieces of the 2025-26 road funding deal that was the culmination of a fraught budget cycle, surrounded by lawmakers and local Macomb County officials. Whitmer signed several tax bills to fund the package in Clinton Township, Mich. Oct. 13, 2025 | Photo courtesy of the Executive Office of the GovernorA hard-fought deal to fund road repairs in perpetuity was inked Monday morning, cementing a legacy item for Michigan’s governor who campaigned tirelessly on fixing the damn roads.
But two of the primary tax revenue sources in the plan face distinct political and legal headwinds, which could scuttle the roads deal even after it became law by way of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s pen.
The governor, along with House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township), several other lawmakers and local officials, signed the budget’s multi-pronged road funding pieces in Clinton Township on Monday morning, each donning high-visibility worksite gear and hardhats.
For Whitmer, the signing was not just the normal ceremonial fare – Whitmer’s win list was always missing a legislatively-funded roads deal, despite her efforts to fix the state’s roads through her executive office and a clever bonding program. SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“I ran on fixing the damn roads, and I’m proud to keep my promise and get it done,” Whitmer said. “This year’s balanced, bipartisan budget makes a record, nearly $2 billion annual investment to fix our state and local roads, which will make everyone’s drive safer and faster. We’re getting this done by ensuring every penny you pay at the pump goes towards our roads. I’m so grateful to legislators on both sides of the aisle for coming together to get this done so we can build reliable roads that last for decades while supporting tens of thousands of good-paying local jobs.”
In all, Whitmer signed seven pieces of legislation to make the road plan work. They include:

House Bill 4180, sponsored by Rep. Donnie Steele (R-Orion);
House Bill 4181, sponsored by Rep. Steve Frisbie (R-Battle Creek);
House Bill 4182, sponsored by Rep. Bradley Slagh (R-Zeeland);
House Bill 4183, sponsored by Rep. Tom Kunse (R-Clare);
House Bill 4951, sponsored by Rep. Samantha Steckloff (D-Farmington Hills);
House Bill 4961, sponsored by Rep. Ann Bollin (R-Brighton); and
Senate Bill 578, sponsored by Sen. Veronica Klinefelt (D-Eastpointe) 

Hall, a Republican leader who found himself seeing eye-to-eye with the Democratic governor on several key budget items this year, called the funding the “biggest roads deal in history,” and a “very big deal for Michigan’s future.”
“We eliminated waste, fraud and abuse in the budget and made smart reforms to make sure the money went to our top priorities,” Hall said. “Our plan finally ensures every penny you pay at the pump goes to road funding, something people have demanded for years. And it sends that money to the local roads and bridges in our neighborhoods, instead of just state highways. Those reforms will make our roads smoother and make life better for the people of Michigan.”
Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks said the budget cycle made the Legislature face unprecedented challenges, but it also gave lawmakers an opportunity to show the rest of the nation how the government can still work for residents in the face of deep political divisions.
“The result: a bipartisan budget that fixes our roads, strengthens public schools, protects health care access, and insulates us from some of the toughest federal cuts,” Brinks said. “Michiganders and their communities stand to benefit both immediately and into the future because of the groundwork we are laying today.” 
Macomb County Executive Mark Hackel, who was present at the signing, said that together, with his county’s partners in the Legislature and Whitmer, they are investing in the infrastructure and assets that will move the state forward.
“With a new, sustained pool of funding, we will enhance our efforts to fix local roads,” Hackel said. “This is a major accomplishment and will make the drive to work or back home smoother and safer for the people of Macomb County.”
The victory lap was warranted after Whitmer fought so long for a legislative roads funding fix, even if it came with some concessions for departmental cuts and needing to find new revenue.
Still, at least two of those funding pieces could be shaky ground as the wheels of the new budget start spinning.
House Bill 4951 enacts a 24% wholesale tax on cannabis products, while House Bill 4961 decouples the state and federal tax codes, blunting the immediate effects of President Donald Trump’s new federal tax cuts.
In the case of the marijuana tax, the policy has been denounced by members of the Michigan cannabis industry and is now the subject of a lawsuit over its passage and impending implementation. If the lawsuit is successful, the tax leaves open a $420 million pothole in the road funding deal.
The decoupling issue is causing heartburn for businesses that were hoping for tax relief on the research and development front, which was anticipated to spur capital growth for innovation. Business groups are now working behind the scenes to lobby the Legislature for changes that would allow some of those tax benefits to reach Michigan sooner than the five year timeline signed into law on Monday. 
Any major scuttling of the decoupling plan could mean a massive hole in state revenues, which is why Democrats fought hard to include it in the final budget deal.
Tyler Theile, vice president and director for public policy with East Lansing-based Anderson Economic Group, in an interview with Michigan Advance, said that would be the unfortunate position the state would find itself in if both taxes failed or were heavily altered.
“It makes me think of the phrase, ‘use it up, wear it out, make a do or do without,’” Theile said. “We really might have to figure out how to operate some programs more efficiently.”
In a press conference following the budget cycle’s completion, Hall said that he’s already eyeing next year’s spending plan and that the House GOP was already contemplating deeper cuts, setting up a potential situation where future reductions would serve to plug holes where either of the controversial 2025-26 taxes might have faltered.

WSHU’s Ebong Udoma spoke with CT Mirror’s John Moritz to discuss his article, “In some CT towns, clouds form over new solar developments,” as part of the collaborative podcast Long Story Short. Read John’s story here. 
WSHU: Hello, John. You used the example of a project in East Windsor to illustrate how initial enthusiasm for large solar arrays has cooled in some Connecticut towns. So what prompted you to look into this particular case? Was it because there was some testimony in the legislature about it?
JM: Well, what really kicked off this reporting process is earlier this year, during the legislative session, I heard a number of lawmakers who represent towns, including East Windsor and the surrounding area, express their concerns about the development of solar projects, and tried to figure out why. And when I looked into it, I realized that East Windsor, just that town, has roughly a quarter of all the utility-scale solar development in Connecticut. And just so people understand and have an idea of what we’re talking about here. We’re not talking about the kind of panels that might go on the home or on your roof, but these are large facilities that can produce enough power to supply the regional electric grid. So we’re talking, you know, in some cases, acres and acres of solar panels here. And because East Windsor and its surrounding towns have access to transmission lines, as well as relatively cheap, flat farmland that’s already been cleared, it makes that particular area an attractive location for solar developers.
WSHU: But you say, you talk to some of the people who are concerned there, and they seem to have supported this initially, when it was supposed to be in a gravel pit, but when it started spreading into farmland, they seemed concerned about it.
JM: Yeah. When you review the testimony, you will find support in the town for a particular project, Gravel Pit Solar, which came before regulators in 2020. And Gravel Pit Solar is now the largest project in Connecticut and one of the largest solar arrays in all of New England. I should be clear that when the gravel pit developers presented their plans to the Connecticut Siting Council, which is in charge of locating these facilities, they made clear in their plans that while the facility is called Gravel Pit Solar, it would not have just covered this former gravel quarry in the town of East Windsor, but that at the time the plans were for, you know, it to include over 200 acres of surrounding farmland. I think what local residents have expressed is their surprise, once the facility actually started becoming under construction, that it was not confined to that gravel pit, and that when combined with other facilities in the area, they feel that developers are snatching up farmland and altering the rural character of the town where they live.
WSHU: Okay. An issue came up about who approves these projects, and the Siting Council generally has the final say on approving a lot of these projects; the local communities feel that it circumvents local control. And that’s an issue that has happened here in Fairfield County, where UI had some huge power lines that they wanted to run along the rail track, and there was local opposition to that. And so what are lawmakers looking into as far as regulating these types of installations going forward?
JM: I think it’s helpful to take a step back here and understand what the Siting Council is. It’s a state agency that was established in 1971 to regulate and oversee the location of certain critical infrastructure projects, such as power plants, and you mentioned transition lines. They also cover hazardous waste facilities and, more recently, the placement of cell phone towers. And these are projects that you know, I think if anyone were given their druthers, no one would want to have one in their own backyard, but due to the need to have these projects, the Siting Council was created specifically to avoid leaving these decisions up to municipalities, so that one state agency can can make sure that the Connecticut as a whole has enough of these critical infrastructure projects to keep going. Now, with the advent of solar technology, where you can kind of put it, used to be, you know, you would build a power plant along a river or somewhere where, you know, along train lines, where you could bring in fuels to power that power plant. Now, solar fields can kind of go anywhere where there’s flat land that is either cleared or can be cleared to access and harness the sun. It’s called decentralized power generation, and we’re seeing a lot more towns that have maybe never had to deal much with the Siting Council become frustrated because they don’t have control over these projects now.
WSHU: If these developments are slowed down, how does that affect Connecticut’s overall energy goals? You know, we’re trying to reduce emissions and achieve cleaner energy, and this is part of our project to obtain cleaner and less expensive energy.
JM: Yeah. Lawmakers have set a clear goal for the state to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, during which time they aim to eliminate all carbon emissions from the state’s power generation. So in order to meet that goal, one of the things we hear from developers and experts on this is that we’re going to have to ramp up renewables a lot, and cheap solar presents the cheapest and quickest method to do that. You know, we’ve seen that the current administration is obviously very opposed to wind power. There’s not a lot of onshore land-based wind power in Connecticut. We can’t really access geothermal or even hydroelectricity. You know, there’s only a limited amount of capacity for that. So solar represents kind of the biggest way for Connecticut to meet these goals. And when you talk to developers and ask, and I ask them about these concerns that have been raised in places like East Windsor, and they make a point of, you know, we understand why neighbors might be concerned, but we need to develop these facilities in the places where it is most feasible and logical for us to do that now. And that includes, you know, they need flat land, especially farmland that might have already been cleared, and they need access to existing infrastructure such as transmission lines and substations. That kind of puts a pinpoint, so to speak, on certain areas of the state where we might see a lot more placement of these large solar facilities than elsewhere.
WSHU: There’s also a time factor here, because some of the tax credits for these projects are running out because the Trump administration, the big, beautiful bill, has zeroed out a lot of those tax credits.
JM: Yeah, so the tax credits are starting to phase out over the next couple of years, and when projects will be specifically able to get them kind of depends on when they get approval from regulators and when they can start construction. But opponents of some of these projects are trying to use those deadlines to see if they can slow down the process and get it to the point where the developers will no longer be able to access these tax credits, and they think that that might help them in their efforts to oppose the projects. You talk to developers, they’re a little bit more cagey on whether they will say, you know, whether they will be able to go ahead with or without the tax credits. It’s possible that some of these larger projects will be financially sound, even in the event that those tax credits go away, or that they might be able to use them. You know, some of the larger developers have been able to pre-purchase panels, essentially, that they have ready to go and deploy once they get approval. So I think what really remains to be seen is how effective opponents will be in using the tax deadline to oppose some of these projects.
WSHU: So, bottom line, John, for the average electricity rate payers. What does this mean?
JM: I think that that kind of needs to be borne out. But certainly every expert that I’ve talked to has said that, you know, increasing the type of cheap, affordable types of renewable power, such as solar, are likely to bring down electric bills, both in the short term and in the long term, provide more reliability and capacity for our great infrastructure, as we see, you know, the demand for power rise through things like electric vehicles, heat pumps and the rollout of data centers.
So, basically, there will still be a push for more solar. I think we can expect to see that.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025_0922_SR_Solar_098-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-13 17:58:38.001534

(SteveDF/Getty Images)Last month, state environment officials issued an order to the New Mexico Department of Transportation to pay $2 million for mishandling and failing to clean up hazardous waste.
It was one of 165 active matters listed in the New Mexico Environment Department’s enforcement roundup for September, which includes updates in allegations of pollution, workplace safety violations and more from the agency.
The order, issued Sept. 25, stemmed from violations and inspections conducted in 2023 at NMDOT’s Materials Testing Laboratory in Santa Fe. The lab, which has been in operation since 1957, conducts experiments on construction materials.
The order said the inspection in 2023 found containers without labels for hazardous waste; improper storage; spills; a lack of employee training and a failure to pay for hazardous waste licenses for the years of 2020 through 2023.
Inspectors “observed numerous containers of hazardous waste that were open and/or deteriorated to the point they could not be considered closed,” the order said.
Further, NMDOT could not provide any documentation demonstrating any plans with first responders in Santa Fe in case of an emergency during the inspection, the order stated.
The 20 violations documented in the 2023 inspection generated a fine of just over $2 million dollars, according to the order, which either needs to be paid or disputed within the next 30 days.
An email and text message to spokespeople at the New Mexico Department of Transportation were acknowledged but unreturned Monday, due to the state holiday.
Another significant fine included a proposed penalty of $300,000 to Aliya’s Foods in Albuquerque after the company failed to protect against hazards that resulted in an employee’s arm amputation after getting it caught in a machine earlier this year.
Aliya’s Foods, which specializes in preparing ready-to-eat frozen meals, did not return messages Monday requesting comment.
The April inspection found employees were cleaning an industrial machine while it was still running. Inspectors also found the worker, employed for less than two months, never received formal training on the machine’s safety mechanisms.
“Employers have a legal and moral obligation to protect workers from preventable hazards, and the Occupational Health and Safety Bureau professionals hold employers accountable to such standards,”Bruce Baizel, the division director for NMED’s Compliance and Enforcement Bureau, said in a statement. “Aliya’s Foods ignored clear warnings about unsafe machinery and failed to enforce basic safety procedures. As a result, a worker suffered a catastrophic and life-changing injury.”

Tennessee’s 2024 Protecting Children from Social Media Act requires users to verify that they are 18 years or older or get permission from their parent or guardian to make an account on a social media platform. For minors’ accounts, the law requires social media companies provide parents access to monitor the child’s activity and messages, as well as the ability to set time restrictions or revoke access.
NetChoice, a trade association including Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, and other social media platforms including X and Reddit, filed a suit challenging the Tennessee law in October 2024. In a news release, Paul Taske, associate director of the NetChoice Litigation Center, said the state law “violates free speech rights and jeopardizes the cybersecurity of minors and adults by creating a honeypot of sensitive information for hackers.”
“NetChoice is suing to defend free speech online, prevent big government from compromising data security, and protect parents’ rights to make decisions for their families,” Taske said in a statement. “… Not only does this violate the First Amendment, but it also endangers the security of all Tennesseans, particularly children by creating a data target for hackers and criminals.”
A U.S. District court denied the request from NetChoice for a preliminary injunction to block the law from enforcement. The organization challenged this decision with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, submitting its opening brief in September.
Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti, a Republican, argued in a brief submitted to the appeals court earlier in October the law does not abridge any free speech rights, but provides protection for minors online.
“The law does not control what anyone can say or not say online,” Skrmetti said in a statement. “The harms social media causes kids are well-documented.  Regardless of how much time and money Big Tech spends fighting against meaningful parental tools, Tennessee will continue to look out for our kids and their parents.”
Bird joined a coalition of 34 states and Washington, D.C. in filing a brief, led by Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier, to support the law. The filing argues social media platforms are “knowingly harming children,” citing studies that have found mental health issues like anxiety, depression and eating disorders are linked with higher social media usage among adolescents.
Bird said she joined the brief in order to help protect children from harms caused by social media.
“Prohibiting companies from profiting off the exploitation of our kids’ mental health is common sense, and it’s the right thing to do,” Bird said in a statement. “Health and safety standards are not unreasonable; they are essential. I’ll continue fighting to protect kids from exploitation.”
NetChoice has succeeded in blocking similar age verification laws through court challenges in states including Ohio and Arkansas.
Iowa lawmakers considered a bill in 2025 to require parental consent for minors to create social media accounts, with parents allowed to revoke access at any time. While there was support in a subcommittee meeting from legislators for a measure giving parents more oversight of their children’s accounts, there were concerns about social media companies’ collection of personal data collection that would be required to implement such a measure.

WILMINGTON — October 16, 2025Hundreds of civic, business, nonprofit, and faith leaders will gather at the Chase Center on the Riverfront this Thursday for the Delaware Leadership Prayer Breakfast, a long-standing tradition that celebrates unity, reflection, and the power of faith in public life.
This year’s keynote speaker is Dr. Timothy Dalrymple, President and CEO of the John Templeton Foundation and former leader of Christianity Today. Known for his thought-provoking work at the intersection of philosophy, faith, and leadership, Dalrymple will share insights on meaning, resilience, and moral courage in a divided world.
“Dr. Dalrymple brings a message that bridges intellect and spirit,” said event co-chair Tim Houseal, who has helped steward the breakfast for more than a decade. “He challenges us to think deeply about how our beliefs shape the way we lead, serve, and live together.”
From Gymnast to Thought Leader
A former national champion gymnast whose career ended with a devastating injury, Dalrymple’s path turned toward theology and the philosophy of religion. He went on to earn degrees from Stanford, Princeton Theological Seminary, and a Ph.D. from Harvard, where his studies focused on the nature of suffering and religious knowledge.
At the John Templeton Foundation, he now oversees one of the world’s largest philanthropic organizations dedicated to exploring purpose, spirituality, and human flourishing. During his tenure at Christianity Today, he nearly doubled revenue and expanded the publication’s global reach through new media ventures.
Music with a Delaware Heartbeat
The morning will also feature music from LU Praise, Liberty University’s multi-ethnic gospel choir led by Patrick “Colby” Shorts of Lincoln, Delaware. Shorts, a worship leader and Liberty alumnus, is known for performances that blend spiritual passion with musical excellence.
“Music has a way of connecting people across every boundary,” Shorts said. “When we sing together, we remember what unites us is far greater than what divides us.”
A Tradition of Leadership and Reflection
Since its founding in 1978, the Delaware Leadership Prayer Breakfast has drawn a remarkable array of national figures who have shared their faith and leadership journeys. Past speakers include:


Brian Dawkins (2024) – NFL and Philadelphia Eagles Hall of Famer


Dr. Betty Uribe (2023) – JPMorgan Chase Managing Director and United Nations Ambassador for Peace & Human Rights


Dr. Francis S. Collins (2022) – Chief Science Advisor to the U.S. President and former Director of the National Institutes of Health


U.S. Senator James Lankford (2019) – Oklahoma senator known for promoting prayer in public life


Eric Metaxas (2016) – Author and nationally syndicated radio host


Pat Williams (2017) – Orlando Magic senior executive and GM of the 1983 World Champion 76ers


Dr. Ben Carson (2001) – Renowned neurosurgeon and later U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development


Joe Gibbs (2000) – Hall-of-Fame NFL coach and NASCAR team owner


Reggie White (2003) – Philadelphia Eagles Hall of Famer and faith leader


Anne Beiler (2008) – Founder of Auntie Anne’s Pretzels and inspirational entrepreneur


Barry C. Black (2006) – Chaplain of the United States Senate


Bill McCartney (2005) – Founder of Promise Keepers and former college football coach


Through decades of change, the breakfast has remained nonpartisan and interdenominational, focused on bringing Delawareans together in prayer and purpose rather than fundraising or advocacy.
“It’s one of the few spaces left where people can set aside titles and politics,” said longtime organizer Carol Houseal. “For one morning, we remember the deeper purpose behind leadership itself.”

Wyoming seeks feedback for how to spend millions in federal health dollars",Katie Klingsporn,,,,,https://wyofile.com/nurses-senior-care-telehealth-wyoming-seeks-feedback-for-how-to-spend-millions-in-federal-health-dollars/,"

Health officials held a whirlwind 11 public meetings and will close a public survey Wednesday. Residents’ feedback is key to how up to $800M could be spent. 
The post Nurses, senior care, telehealth? Wyoming seeks feedback for how to spend millions in federal health dollars appeared first on WyoFile .","As new challenges emerge for Wyoming’s already fragile health care network, the state stands to receive up to $800 million in federal funds aimed at bolstering rural health.
Wyoming health officials have been racing around the state in an effort to collect public input on priorities before submitting an application to the federal Rural Health Transformation Program. They hope more residents will fill out a survey that’ll be open through Wednesday. 
The process is on a condensed schedule, Wyoming Department of Health Deputy Director Franz Fuchs said. Health department staff held 11 public meetings in the last month. Next they will finalize the application due Nov. 5.
As one of America’s most rural states, Wyoming has plenty of needs and challenges related to its health care network — from the long distances patients travel for care to nursing shortages to affordability concerns in hospitals. Advocates expect other new health care policy changes to further hamper access.
What the health department hopes to glean from feedback, Fuchs said, are the public’s top priorities. 
“We get one bite at the apple, for them to approve or deny it,” Fuchs said. With that in mind, he stressed: “We really focused on public engagement, which I think is different from a lot of states. I know certain states have not done any of this, and so I hope it pays off.”
The survey, he added, only takes eight minutes. 
“We want as much participation as possible,” Fuchs said. “It’s really important for the state.”
Opportunity and loss
The Rural Health Transformation Program, created through President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, is designed to funnel $50 billion to states to stabilize and strengthen rural hospitals and providers.
Program funding is intended to support priorities like chronic disease prevention, sustaining care access, workforce development and technical assistance. Funding will be dispersed over five years.

Wyoming’s congressional delegation supported the act, and Republican Sen. John Barrasso singled out the rural health program as an enormous opportunity for the state. 
Health care advocates, however, don’t believe short-term funding can create or sustain solutions to make up for the state’s other shortfalls. Wyoming has long struggled with issues like a dearth of medical professionals, the precarious financial viability of hospitals and deteriorating specialty services.
Recent changes also related to the Beautiful Bill Act will only exacerbate the issue, advocates say. 
The act is projected to reduce federal Medicaid spending by $793 billion over 10 years, resulting in an estimated 10.3 million fewer people enrolled nationally. That’s expected to have downstream effects. The cuts in the federal bill could cost Wyoming nearly 200 jobs per year and shrink the state’s economy by $140 million over five years, an economic analysis finds. 
Some 46,000 state residents, meanwhile, get health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. Enhanced premium tax credits on the Affordable Care marketplace are set to expire at the end of 2025 — and the bill did not renew them. That will result in significant premium spikes for some patients.
Between 11,000-20,000 state residents are at risk of losing their coverage due to the anticipated marketplace cost increases, according to Healthy Wyoming.
High-level
Starting in September, health department staff hosted eight in-person and three virtual meetings on the topic. Meetings took place from Newcastle to Lander, Buffalo to Saratoga. 
Rather than requesting detailed solution proposals, Fuchs said, the federal application asks for “pretty high-level” data on state demographics, current health insurance coverage and chronic conditions. Health department staff, he added, has focused public outreach on narrowing priorities so it can outline strategic initiatives.
People aired all kinds of concerns in the meetings, he said, including workforce shortages, preventative health choices, maternity care gaps and behavioral health needs.

Residents who take the survey also will be able to weigh in on the importance of things like hospital accountability, mobile health units and transportation options for getting to care. 
Though a significant opportunity, Fuchs said, he is cautious about the federal program’s potential to truly transform Wyoming’s health care landscape. 
“I think we want to be realistic,” he said. “$500 million over five years, it’s certainly nice and we want to be responsible stewards of that money and try to make it go the farthest it can. At the end of the day, we’re just hoping to do the best we can with the money, make sure that it goes to good use and try to make these as sustainable as possible.” 
The Wyoming Department of Health aims to get the application to Gov. Mark Gordon by Oct. 27 for review before the Nov. 5 due date.

Josh Stein announced Monday that the state’s medical debt relief initiative has eliminated roughly $6.5 billion in medical debt for 2.5 million North Carolinians.
The program, launched under former Gov. Roy Cooper last July, has far surpassed its initial projection of $4 billion in alleviated debt, and Stein and Health and Human Services Secretary Dev Sangvai said they will continue to search for debts to alleviate.
Focused on debt deemed “uncollectible,” the relief program incentivized the state’s 99 acute care hospitals to relieve medical debt for low- and middle-income patients and expand charity care policies as conditions for receiving higher payments through Medicaid’s Healthcare Access and Stabilization Program. The state also instructed hospitals to stop reporting medical debt to credit agencies.

“For many people, the debt service serves as an anvil holding them back from opportunity and a better life, from getting a mortgage or a small business loan,” Stein said in a news conference at the Executive Mansion. “Unlike most other forms of debt, medical debt is not a choice. Nobody chooses to have a heart attack or get diagnosed with a chronic condition — you just have to deal with it.”
Stein thanked Cooper and former Health and Human Services Secretary Kody Kinsley, the latter of whom was in attendance, for spearheading the “first-of-its-kind” initiative to use federal health care funds as leverage to change hospitals’ debt policies.
“Most of the debt had been on the books for years. It only served to deprive people who had no way of paying back of a brighter financial future,” he said. “If they could have paid, they would have paid.”
The North Carolina Healthcare Association, an advocacy group for the hospital industry, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
The program was able to surpass its initial forecast as participating hospitals found additional debt that could be relieved through the review process that was not included in the initial negotiation between NCDHHS and health care providers, Stein said, adding that he expects that number to grow as hospitals continue the relief process.
To inform North Carolinians that their debt has been erased, NCDHHS has partnered with charity Undue Medical Debt to send explanation letters to those impacted. Undue Medical Debt is set to mail more than 250,000 letters this week informing residents they no longer owe their balances.
“I am particularly proud to highlight that North Carolina’s approach is particularly unique because it facilitates, in the short term, debt relief for families today, while incentivizing long- term policy changes that will end the cycle of medical debt by attacking it at its root cause, ending it before it even starts,” said Undue Medical Debt board vice chair Jose Penabad.
North Carolina Health and Human Services Secretary Dev Sangvai said in a press conference Monday, Oct. 13, 2025 that the medical debt relief program is designed to prevent future debt from accumulating rather than providing a “one-time fix.” (Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)
Stein also used the news conference Monday to reiterate calls for the North Carolina General Assembly to fully fund the state’s Medicaid program and for Congress to renew Affordable Care Act subsidies. “We have so much work to do to improve people’s health and financial wellbeing,” Stein said.
While the program is based on conditioning federal dollars for hospitals, the ongoing government shutdown has not impacted the debt relief efforts, Sangvai said.
He added that NCDHHS will continue to evaluate the effects of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and its changes to Medicaid and HASP, but the debt relief policy changes at the hospital level help ensure the sustainability of the program regardless of federal health care policy.
“This is not a one-time fix,” Sangvai said. “It is a sustainable model that will continue to reduce debt burden and improve access to care for the years ahead,” Sangvai said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PA134462-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-13 17:58:38.001534

Nevada’s cooperation with federal agents violates state law, is eroding the integrity of the judicial system, and is hurting tourism, the ACLU alleges. 
“This isn’t intended to disparage LVMPD,” ACLU of Nevada Executive Director Athar Haseebullah said Monday at a news conference announcing the legal action against Metro and Clark County Sheriff Kevin McMahill. He suggests Metro acquiesced to the federal government because of President Donald Trump’s “administration’s perpetual threats against municipalities, local governments and state governments.” 
Metro’s 287(g) agreement with ICE, named for a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act, allows police to issue civil immigration warrants and detain individuals up to 48 hours beyond their scheduled release so that federal agents may take them into custody. The agreement violates Nevada law, according to the lawsuit, because it was not condoned by state lawmakers. 
Nevada is a Dillon’s Rule state, Haseebullah noted, meaning “if the Nevada Legislature does not grant authority for the local agency to act, the agency cannot do that action.”
State law provides that county jails may house prisoners at the request of the federal government, “but only upon payment of ‘all actual and reasonably necessary costs’ of such confinement,” the suit says, adding even if the term ‘prisoner’ referred to someone with a civil immigration infraction, Metro’s agreement with ICE violates Dillon’s Rule, because it requires Metro to cover all associated costs. 
The suit was filed on behalf of Sergio Morais-Hechavarria, who was found guilty of attempted possession of a stolen vehicle, a gross misdemeanor. He was sentenced by Judge Tara Newberry Clark to an inpatient treatment facility for substance abuse and mental health, and upon completion, to outpatient treatment. Instead, he is being held in the Clark County Detention Center. 
“The unlawful hold, caused by ICE’s 287(g) agreement with LVMPD, has trapped him in indefinite detention, directly obstructing a lawful court order issued by a Nevada judge,” the ACLU said in a news release. The filing asks a court to lift the hold and order Metro to end its agreement.  
The suit, Haseebullah said, is another ACLU has “had to file because of this administration’s desire to create as much instability as they can within our communities.”
He says he expects the case to land before the Nevada Supreme Court. 
“We’d love to get the proper outcome at the District Court level, but I imagine this will go up,” he said at the news conference. “We need a substantive ruling to know whether or not Nevada municipalities or local law enforcement agencies have the ability to act without approval from the state that funds them in large part.”
McMahill, who long maintained Metro would not assist federal agents with immigration enforcement, entered into a 287(g) Memorandum of Agreement with ICE on June 16 of this year, according to the lawsuit, “after the federal government idiotically labeled Las Vegas a ‘sanctuary city’ without even defining ‘sanctuary city,’ and forced Nevada taxpayers to cover the cost of ICE’s work…” Haseebullah said. An exhibit attached to the suit reveals that as of Sept. 1,  LVMPD received 957 requests for assistance from ICE this year. 
“In Nevada, sheriffs and political subdivisions, such as LVMPD, have no existence or powers except by grant of Nevada’s Legislature,” says the ACLU’s pleading. 
“I recognize the tough position that the sheriff’s been put in, that the Mayor of the city of Las Vegas has been put in when they signed an agreement,” Haseebullah noted. “We recognize the decisions made by this administration don’t come with any sort of intellectual honesty.”
The sanctuary designation, he noted, is a “legal misnomer” that is bereft of common definition. 
Nevada was removed from the federal list of sanctuary designations last month after Gov. Joe Lombardo agreed to fully cooperate with federal immigration initiatives. 
In 2019,  then-Sheriff Lombardo suspended Metro’s 287(g) agreement with ICE after a federal court ruled that ICE detainers could be honored only in states that permitted arrests for civil immigration violations. Nevada was not among those states. 
Lombardo, however, informally honored provisions of the agreement after he announced its suspension.

(Photo by Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)SIOUX FALLS — A 340-member club of business and professional leaders in South Dakota’s largest city hopes its public Q&A events will counteract what club members call a growing breakdown in communication and trust among Americans. 
Downtown Sioux Falls Rotary Club President Eric Erickson told South Dakota Searchlight that the service club’s members are concerned about polarization and violence. He hopes to make peacebuilding and conflict prevention a theme of some of the club’s regularly scheduled public Q&A sessions with local and state leaders.
“We’re not expecting everyone to ultimately agree, but we’re saying that when you do disagree, here’s the civil way to do it,” he said.


Commentary on civility

Governor squanders his credibility on civil discourse with ‘eat a salad’ comment
John Thune has a chance to be an example of civility for the country



The first themed discussion on Monday brought together a political science professor, a civil discourse advocate and educator, and a counselor. Moderated by Erickson, the foundational discussion explored topics ranging from empathy and identity politics to the importance of maintaining civic norms.
Erickson said future events in the series may bring together people who stand on opposite sides of issues.
“It takes courage to stand up and say, ‘This is what I believe in,’ but it also takes an equal amount of courage to say, ‘I understand you believe something differently, and I’m willing to sit here and listen,’” Erickson said.
Monday’s political science professor panelist, David Wiltse with South Dakota State University, warned that declining participation in civic institutions — like churches and political parties — has weakened the “social fabric” that once connected Americans. He called groups like Rotary essential in helping bridge differences and rebuild trust.
Erickson said the club’s role is to lead by example and show that civility and disagreement can coexist.
“We want to create a space where these conversations don’t break down into finger-pointing and shouting,” Erickson said. “It’s about understanding, not winning.”

Market St. in Iowa City. (Photo via Google Earth)The bankrupt Mercy Hospital of Iowa City is taking its former business partners, MercyOne and Catholic Health Initiatives, to court in a dispute over $55 million.
A federal lawsuit, filed on behalf of the Iowa City hospital and its creditors, accuses MercyOne and CHI of scuttling a planned business deal so as to avoid the obligation of paying workers’ pensions while giving a six-figure severance package to a former top executive who often failed to show up for work.
The claims within the lawsuit, originally made in August as part of Mercy-Iowa City’s ongoing bankruptcy case, are now a separate cause of action that alleges breach of contract, unjust enrichment and breach of fiduciary duty.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
MercyOne and its fellow defendants have yet to file a response to the lawsuit, but in a statement issued after the August filing, MercyOne said it has “always acted in the best interests of Mercy-Iowa City.”
MercyOne said it “has become a potential scapegoat for the impact of bankruptcy,” adding that “there is no basis for any claim against MercyOne or any affiliated entity or individual.”
Mercy Hospital-Iowa City and its Liquidation Trust Oversight Committee are suing MercyOne, CHI and an affiliate, Iowa Heart Center, in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa in an effort to avoid what the plaintiffs call “fraudulent transfers” to MercyOne and Iowa Heart Center.
The lawsuit seeks to recover, on behalf of the Iowa City hospital’s creditors, at least $55 million.
Also named as a defendant in the case is Sean Williams, the former president and CEO of the Iowa City hospital. The lawsuit claims Williams breached his fiduciary duty to the institution by quietly advancing MercyOne’s interests at the expense of the hospital he was hired to lead.
The Liquidation Trust Oversight Committee alleges the Iowa City hospital transferred funds to MercyOne as required by an affiliation agreement the two entered into in 2017, purportedly as part of a move that would allow MercyOne to help the Iowa City hospital with financial and operational issues the latter was facing.
According to the lawsuit, MercyOne made numerous representations to the Iowa City hospital that it would work toward implementing a “complete and strategic affiliation relationship” that would have essentially resulted in a merger.
The agreement, the lawsuit states, was viewed as an “engagement ring,” with the details and formalities of the “corporate wedding” to be worked out at a later date.
Rather than helping the Iowa City hospital address its problems, the lawsuit claims, MercyOne and CHI exacerbated those problems, saddling Mercy Hospital-Iowa City “with steep payment obligations to MercyOne in exchange for a number of services that MercyOne did not provide.”
Additionally, the lawsuit alleges, despite continuing representations to the contrary, MercyOne did not deliver promised services and staff related to financial management, purchasing, risk management, human resources, clinical oversight, medical-staff credentialing, physician recruitment and telemedicine services.
By failing to acknowledge its lack of intent to complete the affiliation, the lawsuit claims, MercyOne induced the Iowa City hospital “to continue on in an expensive relationship for over four years.”
Eventually, the lawsuit claims, MercyOne, faced with its own operating losses and the desire to avoid taking on the additional financial obligation of the Iowa City hospital’s underfunded pension plan, opted to abandon the planned affiliation.
When MercyOne “finally told” the Iowa City hospital of its plans to end their relationship, Mercy Hospital-Iowa City’s financial situation had deteriorated to the point where it was much less attractive to any other potential acquisition partner, the lawsuit claims.
CEO accused of putting staff at risk 
In addition to the allegations against MercyOne and its parent, CHI, the liquidation committee alleges that Williams, the Iowa City hospital’s CEO from 2018 to 2021, worked against the hospital’s own interests.
Williams had previously served as MercyOne’s CEO for Mercy Medical Center-Clinton and was part of MercyOne’s executive team, the lawsuit notes, and alleges that he “was strongly encouraged to, and did, resign” in 2021.
During his tenure as CEO, Williams “was regularly absent” from the hospital during business hours, the lawsuit claims, and on one of his first days of employment, he directed the staff to remove the desktop computer that had been set up for him, stating he did not need it.
“Williams largely attempted to perform his role as CEO,” the lawsuit alleges, “from a smartphone, and was known to have issues reviewing or accessing important documents.”
The lawsuit goes on to allege that at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and through his resignation in September 2021, Williams “refused to wear a mask” when at the hospital, despite mask-related directives from the State of Iowa and the hospital’s own policy requiring masks.
“Numerous staff and medical providers at Mercy-Iowa City were furious that their CEO risked their safety during the pandemic by refusing to wear a mask,” the lawsuit alleges. “Williams placed Mercy-Iowa City’s reputation and, most importantly, the health and lives of Mercy-Iowa City’s employees, at significant risk during the COVID-19 pandemic by refusing to wear a mask… Williams’ conduct constitutes gross negligence, bad faith, and/or willful misconduct.”
The lawsuit also alleges Williams had the Iowa City hospital enter into an agreement with the Iowa Heart Center, a wholly owned subsidiary of MercyOne, which involved the center leasing space and equipment from Mercy Hospital-Iowa City at far less than market value, damaging the hospital’s financial position.
On Dec. 1, 2020, the lawsuit claims, Williams was placed on a performance improvement plan. In August 2021, the hospital’s board chairman met with Williams to review his performance, and it was during that meeting that Williams indicated he would resign, the lawsuit alleges.

A jury has convicted a former Connecticut man of murder in the death of a Northeast Kingdom man nearly six years ago.
The jury returned its guilty verdict on Friday in Orleans County Superior criminal court in Newport, convicting Brownswell Cedano, 31, of a charge of second-degree murder in the death of 37-year-old Richard Poginy of Glover in November 2019 in Barton.
The verdict followed a six-day trial.

Cedano, a resident of Hartford, Connecticut, at the time, assaulted Poginy outside a Barton home on Nov. 2, 2019, and fled the scene, according to charging documents. 
Poginy, according to police, then drove away from the residence and crashed his vehicle a short distance away while driving at a low speed. He died a week later at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, New Hampshire, court records stated. 
Initially, police did not report his death as a homicide. Later, following an autopsy and additional investigation, a medical examiner ruled the cause of Poginy’s death was “complications of blunt impact head injuries” and the manner of death was a homicide, according to police.
According to the medical examiner’s findings, the “documented minor damage to the vehicle without airbag deployment suggests a low-speed collision that is inconsistent with the severity of the head injuries.”
A sentencing date on the murder conviction had not been set as of Monday afternoon. The conviction carries a sentence of 20 years to life in prison. 
Orleans County State’s Attorney Farzana Leyva, whose office prosecuted the case, declined comment Monday. 
Michael Shane, Cedano’s attorney, could not be reached Monday for comment. 
Cedano had been sentenced in November 2022 to seven years in federal prison following a conviction for drug distribution in Rutland County, according to court records.
He was among four people arrested in November 2020 after authorities raided an apartment in Rutland City, seizing cocaine, fentanyl, illegal prescription drugs and four firearms, federal court records stated.
In addition to selling illegal drugs in Rutland County, according to federal prosecutors, Cedano was also trafficking heroin and cocaine in Orleans County. At the time of the drug raid in Rutland, court records stated, Cedano was on probation for a Connecticut drug offense while he was traveling to Vermont to sell drugs.
Cedano was listed by the Vermont Department of Corrections on Monday as incarcerated at the Northern State Correctional Facility in Newport.

Vermont Blue Advantage will no longer offer any Medicare Advantage plans in the state for 2026. 
On October 1, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont announced Vermont Blue Advantage would not continue coverage for the 26,000 people in the state on its individual Medicare Advantage plans for next year. The company is also ending all existing employer-sponsored retiree plans.
Whether the company will return to Vermont’s insurance landscape in the future, “depends on whether market conditions improve, or new opportunities open that would enable Vermont Blue Advantage to offer sustainable and competitive plans,” Andrew Garland, a vice president and spokesperson for the insurer, told VTDigger.

Vermont Blue Advantage has provided Medicare Advantage coverage for the state’s 7,000 retired teachers, but that contract was not renewed for 2026, the Office of the State Treasurer announced in September. The shift was unplanned but necessary after Vermont Blue Advantage proposed a 50% premium increase in July, according to Treasurer Mike Pieciak.
Two other smaller employers also coordinated coverage for their retirees through Vermont Blue Advantage plans, Kaj Samsom, the state’s commissioner of the Department of Financial Regulation, confirmed. Those employers are also losing that option in 2026. 
Medicare Advantage plans, also known as Part C plans, are an option to those eligible for Medicare. The plans are run by a private company with federal funding and generally include broader coverage than traditional Medicare, which covers 80% of health expenses and requires a separate plan for prescription drug coverage. 
Vermonters who lose coverage when their Medicare Advantage plans end will have the option to enroll in a Medigap private plan to supplement traditional Medicare, the state’s health care advocate Mike Fisher told lawmakers last week. 
Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont has faced severe solvency issues due to an unanticipated increase in the number and complexity of claims. The nonprofit insurer lost $152 million between 2021 and 2024, according to its reporting to the state. At least 20% came from losses through Vermont Blue Advantage, which Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Vermont runs in conjunction with its counterpart and parent company in Michigan, since sale of the Medicare Advantage plans launched in 2021. 
Simultaneously, insurers all across the country have been scaling back their Medicare Advantage coverage as changes in federal regulations have made the plans less profitable for those who run them. 
Next year, Vermonters who live in most of the state’s counties who purchase their Medicare plans themselves will have no Medicare Advantage plans available to them. In addition to the end of the Vermont Blue Advantage option, UnitedHealthcare — one of the largest purveyors of Medicare Advantage plans nationwide — announced on October 1 that it also no longer would sell its plans in Vermont. That plan served roughly 7,800 Vermonters, according to United Healthcare.
Now, the only plans available for individuals to purchase are a handful of Humana Advantage plans in Bennington, Caledonia, Essex, Orange, Windham and Windsor counties.
However, employers that provide retiree medical benefits still have other options. 
New insurer for Vermont teachers
After the high premium increase proposed by Vermont Blue Advantage, the Vermont Treasurer’s office struck a three-year contract with the insurance company HealthSpring to cover the retired teachers plan. HealthSpring also has been providing coverage to Vermont State College retirees. 
The teachers will still experience a 16.2% rate increase on the HealthSpring plan — though it is a far cry from Vermont Blue Advantage’s proposed 50% increase. 
“The 50% increase was kind of shocking for me and for everybody that was reviewing this,” Treasurer Pieciak said. In previous years, the premiums increased around 5-10%. 
“I think just those two numbers tell the story about the state of healthcare,” he added. “Who would have thought that a 16% increase would be something that you’d be happy with?” 
Still, Pieciak says that the shift saves those covered by the plan from paying hundreds of dollars a year in additional premiums, and it saves the state “tens of millions of dollars” required for its portion of the plans. It also would have increased the unfunded pension liability by $215 million, he said. 
The treasurer said his office weighed four questions in their decision to shift to HealthSpring: “What were the benefits? What was the network? What was the cost? And then what was the stability of the carrier and the contract?” 
The benefits on the HealthSpring plans are the same or stronger, as those on Vermont Blue Advantage, Pieciak said.
Pieciak is optimistic that the shift to HealthSpring will offer some stability for the plans in the state. “The scale that [HealthSpring is] able to bring to the challenge that we’re facing here in Vermont on health care affordability is beyond anything that we can do on our own,” he said. “Maybe it’s better, in this particular area of insurance, to have a more experienced, much larger player.” 
Unexpected benefit
Patient advocates note one there are some upsides for current Medicare Advantage policyholders losing coverage if they want to shift to traditional Medicare. 
“This is not an all good or an all bad situation,” the state’s health care advocate Mike Fisher said at a legislative committee meeting at the Statehouse Thursday. “I know there are those that are celebrating it because they hate Medicare Part C.” 
If individuals themselves choose to leave Medicare Advantage, for traditional Medicare, they may face obstacles getting a supplemental commercial plan, called Medigap, which can cover the remainder of expenses that traditional Medicare does not. Federal law allows those insurers to either deny coverage entirely or charge higher premiums based on pre-existing health conditions. 
However, if people lose their coverage due to the plan no longer being offered, they are protected from those increased costs by federal and state regulations. 
But Fisher cautioned during the meeting that many Medigap plans in Vermont are prohibitively expensive, even with those protections. 
“My big fear is that with the loss of the [Medicare Advantage] market, we are going to really drive up the number of Vermonters with no secondary coverage. Predictably, many of them will have costs they can’t pay for,” he told the committee.
The annual open enrollment period for individuals to choose Medicare plans for the coming year begins Oct. 15 and runs through Dec. 7, but those losing their coverage have a special enrollment period through Feb. 28, 2026 — though waiting until the new year to enroll may cause a gap in coverage as the plans close out at the end of 2025. 
Vermont Blue Advantage has guidance for patients navigating the change of coverage. 
The State Health Insurance Program (SHIP) is also prepared to help Medicare beneficiaries navigate their coverage and is gearing up for a surge in demand as thousands of Vermonters need to pivot in their Medicare plans. The Medicare handbook, Medicare.gov and 1-800-Medicare also remain resources for individuals to find new plans — and are functioning even as the federal government shutdown enters its second week.

Free.,"Trump, U.S. leaders celebrate end of hostilities in Gaza",Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-us-leaders-celebrate-end-hostilities-gaza,,"WASHINGTON — After just over two years in Hamas captivity, the surviving Israeli hostages were released Monday as President Donald Trump visited Israel and Egypt to celebrate a U.S.-brokered peace deal to end the war in Gaza.In remarks to Israel’s Knesset, the country’s parliamentary body, Monday afternoon Jerusalem time, Trump hailed “the golden age of Israel and the golden age of the Middle East.”“Israel, with our help, has won all that they can by force of arms. You've won. I mean, you've won. Now it's time to translate these victories against terrorists on the battlefield into the ultimate prize of peace and prosperity for the entire Middle East. It's about time you were able to enjoy the fruits of your labor,” Trump said during remarks that lasted just over an hour.Israeli military forces, with financial and arms support from the United States, have bombarded the Gaza Strip since Hamas militants launched a surprise attack on Israel from the Palestinian territory on Oct. 7, 2023, killing roughly 1,200 and taking 250 people captive. Gaza health officials said Monday the death toll in the small enclave had risen to 67,869 since the conflict began, including roughly 60 in the past 24 hours, according to Palestinian National Authority state-run media.Hamas returned the remaining living 20 Israeli hostages Monday and committed to returning bodies of deceased hostages as part of the ceasefire agreement. In exchange, Israel released roughly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.As of Monday, Hamas still had to return the remains of two dozen hostages killed while held captive. The militant group that holds political power in Gaza returned the remains of four hostages to the National Institute for Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv, CNN reported Monday.Trump calls for Netanyahu pardonMany who attended Trump’s Knesset remarks wore red MAGA-style hats bearing the message “Trump the Peace President,” according to journalists who traveled with Trump to Israel.Trump said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will be remembered “far more” for the peace deal than for the fighting. Trump notably asked Israeli President Isaac Herzog to pardon Netanyahu, who is under investigation for bribery and fraud.“Hey, I have an idea. Mr. President, why don't you give him a pardon?” Trump said, adding, “Cigars and some champagne — who the hell cares?”Egypt meetingTrump then traveled to Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, Monday evening, where roughly 30 world leaders met for a short summit marking the deal between Israel and Hamas — with many details yet to be hammered out.Among those present was Mahmoud Abbas, president of the Palestinian National Authority. Video published by The New York Times showed Trump and Abbas chatting and shaking hands. Trump held onto Abbas’ hand while giving a thumbs-up with his other hand for a photo of the pair.Trump invited Netanyahu, but the prime minister declined “due to time constraints” ahead of an upcoming holiday, according to an announcement posted by his office.Trump, along with the leaders of Egypt, Qatar and Turkey, signed what the president described as a “document that’s going to spell out a lot of rules and regulations.”The White House did not immediately respond to a request for text of the document.Speaking to reporters as he signed the “historic document” in front of two rows of presidents and prime ministers, Trump marveled at how long it took to achieve the cessation of hostilities and predicted “it’s gonna hold up, too.”The 20-point peace plan required the release of all living and deceased Israeli hostages, a phased withdrawal of Israeli forces and a reform of the Palestinian government, including completely disarming Hamas of weapons and political power. World leaders heaped praise on Trump at Monday’s summit. Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said the U.S. president is “a man of peace” and that he backed Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, according to video and reports from journalists at the summit. Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi awarded Trump the Nile Collar, his country’s highest state honor.U.S. leaders reactU.S. Republican and Democratic lawmakers alike praised the freeing of the surviving Israeli hostages.House Speaker Mike Johnson applauded the “leadership, strength, and fortitude of President Trump.”“For the first time in 738 days, there are no living Israelis hostages (sic) in the hands of Hamas. In just eight and half months in office, President Trump and his Administration have ensured the safe release and return of all 20 living Israeli hostages from Hamas captivity, putting lasting peace in the Middle East within reach,” the Louisiana Republican said in a statement Monday.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who delivered a scathing rebuke on the Senate floor to Netanyahu’s leadership last year, celebrated the ceasefire deal Monday.“Today is a wonderful day. Finally, finally, finally, the last living hostages brutally held by Hamas are home, an immense and overwhelming sigh of relief. I commend the enormous advocacy of the tireless hostage families, President Trump, his administration, and all who helped make this moment happen,” Schumer, a New York Democrat, said in a statement.“Today, we celebrate the return of the hostages — the joyous images of their reuniting with their families — and we solemnly reaffirm our commitment to bringing home all the deceased hostages, including my constituents Omer Neutra and Itay Chen.”Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, an outspoken critic of Israel’s bombardment of Gaza, urged the immediate activation of humanitarian aid to the territory, including granting “unfettered access” to the United Nations.The Vermont senator, who caucuses with Democrats, said in a statement that Americans must “grapple with our role in this extremely dark chapter,” highlighting that the U.S. government provided billions in taxpayer dollars to support what he described as “Netanyahu’s barbaric campaign.”“The vast majority of Americans understand that Israel had a right to defend itself against the horrific Hamas terrorist attack that killed 1,200 innocent people and took 250 hostages,” Sanders said. “But most Americans also understand that Israel did not have the right to go to war against the entire Palestinian people, killing or wounding almost 237,000 Palestinians — more than 10 percent of Gaza’s population — most of them women, children, and the elderly.”",,,,2025-10-13 16:57:17.853918

""We’ve done 15 so far, and we’re not at our busy season yet,"" said Brian Lindner, a founding member of the Waterbury Backcountry Rescue Team.

This story by Sarah Andrews was first published in The Waterbury Roundabout via the Community News Service, which is part of the University of Vermont’s Reporting & Documentary Storytelling program. 
WATERBURY — A few weeks ago, a young man wandered off the Bamforth Ridge Trail on Camel’s Hump. At around 3 a.m., his cell phone battery was exhausted, and he was guiding himself by the cardiac monitor light on his smartwatch.
Around 1 a.m., Waterbury Backcountry Rescue Team was called out to find the missing hiker. The team searched the trails for hours before one member saw that flashing green cardiac light in the darkness. The team located the lost hiker and guided him back to the parking lot. 
Through the start of Octobor, the team had responded to 15 calls so far this year, compared to 10 in all of 2024, according to Brian Lindner, a founding member of the group. “The numbers just change drastically,” Lindner said. “2025 is looking to be a record year … and we’re not at our busy season yet.” 
Whether it’s frozen boots or broken tibias, Waterbury Backcountry Rescue Team is prepared to respond to any kind of backcountry crisis.  Since the organization began responding to emergencies in Waterbury’s outdoor recreation areas in 2002, it has rescued almost 300 hikers, skiers and mountain bikers.
WBRT is made up of 21 volunteers, all of whom are extensively trained to respond quickly and safely to crises on the summits of nearby peaks in the Green Mountains, such as Camel’s Hump, Mt. Hunger and Bolton Mountain.  The group was founded to fill the need for specialized backcountry rescues, a responsibility that used to fall under the purview of the Waterbury Fire Department. 
Backcountry rescues often require more than a dozen responders to execute properly, and often require highly technical training and precise equipment. “It was just willy-nilly,” Lindner said of those early days. “We had the wrong people there in the wrong places.”
“The firefighters are firefighters, and they were the ones getting called to respond to lost and injured people outside of their typical urban terrain,” said Heidi Higgins-Cutler, an EMT and longtime member of WBRT.
The backcountry rescue team was first formed as a special unit of Waterbury Ambulance Service, Inc. The nonprofit EMS outfit has been around since 1971, serving Waterbury, Duxbury and Moretown, along with neighboring EMS agencies as needed.
On a recent afternoon, Lindner and Higgins-Cutler shared stories of their rescues while they sat in Waterbury Ambulance Service’s newly built Steele Rescue Station. They were interrupted by the chatter of walkie-talkies and muffled radio calls.

Higgins-Cutler has been an EMT with Waterbury Ambulance Service, Inc. since 1982. She says that she has seen the need for backcountry response grow as more people get interested in the outdoors. “I got involved to be a caregiver, and to help carry where I can,” she said. “I’ve spent a lot of time on the mountain, and it holds a special place for me, so (WBRT) does as well.”
Lindner has been a first responder since 1986. During his childhood, his father worked as the patrol director at Stowe Mountain. “I actually remember getting dragged along on some of those rescues by him. I guess it was just the natural thing to do,” Lindner said.
More than half of the calls WBRT responds to are for searches, and WBRT responds quickly, Lindner said. “We’ve got a team in the woods, on the fly, and moving, within the first hour. That is not standard procedure,” he said.
In January 2011, a couple was skiing and snowboarding on Camel’s Hump. The pair got separated, and the woman got trapped in a ravine. The couple called 911, and the young woman was located, well after sunset, by a Vermont National Guard helicopter. Unhurt, the woman was guided out of the ravine by WBRT.  “We respond to a lot of those calls, where they are trapped by darkness,” Lindner said.
In fall foliage season now and as winter begins, Lindner stressed the importance of preparation by those heading out into the backcountry.  “The big thing we see is people going up on a warm sunny day, it’s 2 in the afternoon… It’s just wonderful. And they get up there, and this time of year, it gets dark quicker. It’s just being totally unprepared for the changing season,” Lindner said.
Higgins-Cutler adds that darkness is not the only potential hazard. “The folks who go with no water, they go with no food, no extra clothes, or 15% on their phone battery. Then, they are surprised when it takes us an hour and a half to get to them,” she said.
Higgins-Cutler and Lindner say that hydration and warm clothing are non-negotiables as the seasons change. “Headlamps are huge, fluids are huge, extra clothing is huge,” Lindner said. “Lone hikers are frequent; unprepared hikers are constant.”

The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
“I don’t think we’ve done a very good job of engaging with people who are receiving our services, friends and family,” Hoy said in a speech at the EXPO gala Oct. 11 at the Monona Terrace Community and Convention Center in Madison, explaining the reason for conducting Friends and Family Forums between DOC management and the public.
Hoy, one of two keynote speakers during the “EXPOnential” gala, expressed the aim of overcoming challenges confronted by people caught up in the carceral system, including several honorees at the event who had served time in prison, some still on community supervision, including a woman working on becoming a certified peer counselor, a former Iraq war vet and practicing lawyer from Eau Claire, and a newly appointed official for Milwaukee.
EXPO is a non-profit advocacy group in Wisconsin that works to end mass incarceration, dismantle structural discrimination and restore formerly incarcerated people to community life. It’s largely staffed by the formerly incarcerated, including its executive director, Jerome Dillard, who explained the theme of the gala.
The term exponential, he said, is  “not just a gala name, but it’s a map of mercy and it’s an algorithm of potential. An exponent takes a small number and it raises it and turns it into two, into many and sparks into a skyline. And that’s what Wisconsin EXPO is. It’s organizing with formerly incarcerated neighbors to restore rights.”

Marianne Oleson, operations director for EXPO, noted the Beth Israel Center, a conservative synagogue in Madison, was receiving the Ally Organization of the Year recognition for its “shared love” with EXPO’s goals.
“Beth Israel has opened their doors so that we can gather, learn and share our truth with the community, but their generosity extends far beyond the walls of their synagogue,” said Oleson. “They have opened their homes and they have opened their hearts to us. They share their wisdom, compassion, creativity. in so many ways that remind us what true allyship looks like. They give our state residents rides, share the incredible gifts of art, and they bring us homemade lasagna.”

Deandrea “Dee” Hardman received the Woman of the Year recognition. Hardman said before going to prison she had made many bad decisions, living on the streets, surrounded by people who took advantage of her, and burning bridges with people in her life, so that when she left the chaos of her life for prison, she actually felt free.
“Going to prison disrupted my tormented cycle,” she said. “It was the first time I felt like I had an option to choose a different life. I had every opportunity that came my way to grow and change.”
In prison she became a certified welder and participated in work release, and even though she was surrounded by others who didn’t want to change their behavior from the street, she chose differently.
She said being able to reenter society in the EXPO Safe House helped her succeed outside of prison.
“I came home and worked extremely hard, but it was not solely my hard work that got me here — It was my sisters who supported me in the home and everyone who works within the organization,” she said. “For the first time in my life, I was leaving an institution not alone, but with an entire team of people behind me who wanted to help me and have absolutely nothing but the best for me.”
Hardman noted that she had just received her certification to become a peer support specialist and her aim was to share her experience with others to overcome the trauma of addiction and imprisonment.

Man of the Year David Carlson said Expo was one of the first organizations that helped him gain a “foothold” and “get traction in rebuilding my life after re-entry.”
His wife, Alicia Carlson, said her husband was identified by  the number “558672” when he was serving time in prison, but recently he had obtained another number, “1138342,” his state bar license number to practice law in Wisconsin.
“He stepped out of a system that had silenced him and set out on a mission to make people listen, and just as important to make sure that those around him, especially those who’ve been overlooked, blocked out, written off, were seen and heard too,” she said.
Of the two numbers identifying her husband, she said, one reminded him of what it was like to be silenced and the other “gives him a platform to make sure others never are.”
Carlson described the initiatives  her husband launched since he left prison, including a peer support agency with 80 mentors operating in 30 western Wisconsin counties
Carlson, who is now the Justice Forward Wisconsin Coalition coordinator, noted he was sentenced after serving a second tour in Iraq in the military. While in the Stanley Correctional Facility, he had the opportunity to leave early under the earned release program, but he was a self-described  “hothead” who probably was going to serve his whole sentence until a mentor, a fellow resident, saw his potential.
“Instead of seeing me as a dumb, young hothead, he really took me time to mentor me,” Carlson said. “I think mentorship is a key theme in my life and my success in what I have accomplished.”
The Justice Forward Wisconsin Coalition, he said, is a network of “justice-impacted individuals mentoring each other and advocating for each other.”
He said the work needs to be led by those who have experienced incarceration.
“But if you’ve never felt what it feels like to be by yourself in solitary confinement, if you’ve never felt what it feels like to be a teenager in solitary confinement missing your mom, if you’ve never felt what it feels like to be treated and dehumanized after a visit, strip searched, told to bend over and cough — like, these types of things never go away,” he said. “I’m 10 years out, and it never goes away. I’m a lawyer, and it never goes away… I think that it’s time that individuals that have those experiences lead the way, and that’s what this coalition is about.”

Adam Procell, the new director of Community Wellness and Safety for the City of Milwaukee, a position that aims to prevent and reduce violence through community partnerships, received the Ramiah Whiteside Changemaker recognition.
Procell said on the first day of his new position he went back to the site where 35 years earlier, at age 15, when he was a gang member, he had killed 18-year-old Robert Bruce.
“Day One of my job, I went and started at the scene of my crime because I knew I was going to have to ask others to lean into uncomfortable situations,” said Procell, “So I can’t ask the community to lean into uncomfortability unless I take my two feet to be the most uncomfortable place on the face of this Earth, which is where Robert lost his life.”
Procell said there was much pressure on him to succeed and he admitted that he needed help and encouragement. He said others should also be honest about their struggles, adding that “transformation is never born in isolation – It rises from connections.” 
“It wasn’t punishment that changed me. It was the love and hope that I got when I came into this community that made a huge difference, and it changed me,” Procell said.
Hoy talks about changing the DOC culture
During his keynote speech, Hoy noted that in one of his early training sessions at the DOC, he participated in an exercise for recruits in which they were asked whether they perceived themselves as different from those they would be supervising or the same, and he perceived himself as the same.
“And that always stuck with me, because fundamentally I don’t see myself at all different than any people that are being sentenced to Wisconsin DOC,”  he said. 
Hoy said he was challenged by Procell to talk to those receiving services from the DOC to see how effective those services were.
Hoy said he told his staff that they would sit in a room with members of the community to listen.
“It’s just to hear how our policies, how our decisions, impact the lives of not only the people that we care for, provide services to, but their friends and family, and it’s probably been one of the best things that I’ve done since I started,” he said.
Hoy thought the forums would be opportunities to educate the public as well as providing feedback to the DOC.
“I think we are benefiting more by just being there and listening and understanding that the folks across the table and in those small groups are human beings just like us,” he said. “After the first forum, I sat at a table, after just about everybody left with a warden, and I won’t out him, but he was in tears and talked about how much his decisions impact not just people in our care, but their families and their systems. That is culture change.”
Hoy said recommendations are being generated to change the operation of the DOC, but what is more fundamentally important to him is the department’s culture.
“If we don’t make sure to address the culture and how we treat people, making sure that everything we do is treating people with dignity and respect, it’s not going to matter if we bring the overhead time from 35 days on average down to 20 or whatever it might be,” he said.
He noted that those working in maximum security prisons and restrictive housing settings often experience aggression by residents, including bodily fluids thrown at correctional officers.
“I get a lot of pushback when I say, not letting anybody off the hook for it, but what are the conditions that we are creating that make it OK for a human being to do that to another human being?” He said. “That’s the culture that we have to address, and it’s not everywhere. I’m not up here to completely bash DOC. I mean, I’ll tell it like it is, but there are pockets [needing change].”
Hoy also asked for understanding on the difficulty of making changes in an organization with 10,000 staff, 70,000 in community supervision and over 23,000 incarcerated.
“There’s going to be challenges; there’s going to be gaps,” he said of the DOC. But he asked for understanding for the thousands of people who  work for  DOC “who  “are trying to help change lives.”
National effort

The last keynote speaker of the evening was David Ayala, executive director of the national organization of The Formerly Incarcerated Convicted People and Families Movement, a network of over 60 organizations.
Ayala talked about the work of EXPO as part of a national movement that centers leadership by the people directly affected by the carceral system, narrative story-telling,  fighting for systemic change and creating infrastructure for reentry.
He stressed the importance of telling success stories like Carlson’s journey to obtaining his law degree.
“We need to lift up stories like that,” he said, “… there are many Davids across this country.”
Ayala encouraged EXPO to work across state lines with similar organizations.
“You’re not alone,” he told the group.  “You are part of a rich, resilient national web — a movement that believes freedom is not just a word, but a living horizon where every person returning home is met with care, dignity, and possibilities.”

Martin Hickey (D-Albuquerque), left, and Rep. Marianna Anaya (D-Albuquerque) told Source recently they have already decided on legislation to address New Mexico’s medical malpractice laws. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham also announced the issue will be on the call for the upcoming 30-day session. (Courtesy NM Legislature)State lawmakers and Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham are promising to take a big swing to address the state’s doctor shortage at the upcoming legislative session, with medical malpractice reform at the center of expected debate come January. 
The governor told New Mexico In Focus in an interview that aired Friday that she would put medical malpractice on the call of the 30-day session. That means lawmakers will be able to debate and approve legislation on the topic at a session that is otherwise confined to budgetary matters.
Her office did not respond Monday to Source New Mexico’s request for more details about what reforms the governor wants to see. But several lawmakers recently gave Source a preview of legislation they intend to introduce when that issue comes up in January. 
New Mexico has among the highest rates of medical malpractice lawsuits in the country, and doesn’t limit punitive damages or attorneys’ fees. Advocacy groups and some lawmakers point to the high costs of medical malpractice insurance as a major factor driving doctors away from the state.
According to the New Mexico Medical Association, 248 doctors left the state between 2021 and 2024. A recent study from nonpartisan advocacy group Think New Mexico study says the state lacks more than 10,000 health care workers in a variety of specialties. 
Lawmakers from both parties have a variety of fixes they say they will introduce when the session kicks off on Jan. 20:
Cap punitive damages
State Sen. Martin Hickey (D-Albuquerque), a retired physician, told Source outside an interim legislative committee meeting last week in Albuquerque that lawmakers can’t continue with half-measures.
“I mean, this is the state not to go to. No one’s hiring,” he said of the doctor shortage. “The largest groups in Albuquerque haven’t hired anyone in two to three years because of the malpractice,” he said, though he noted another factor is that compensation has been relatively low in some specialty areas. 
Think NM: Address medical malpractice, licensing to lessen health care worker shortage

Hickey said he is working with some “interested parties” on drafting a bill with significant changes, though he declined to say exactly who, apart from Think New Mexico. He said they’re all tasked with answering this question: 
“Will a reform bill change the climate in New Mexico such that physicians feel it’s safe to practice here right now?” he said. “They don’t feel it’s safe to practice here, so they don’t come.”
One sure change in the bill, he said, would limit the amount of punitive damages awarded to plaintiffs and their lawyers who win medical malpractice litigation. 
Changes there include raising the standard of evidence plaintiffs’ lawyers have to meet for juries to consider awarding punitive damages, which are intended to punish gross negligence or deliberate harm. 
Under current law, the standard plaintiffs’ lawyers have to meet is “preponderance of the evidence,” a relatively low evidentiary standard. It means lawyers have only to prove that their case for punitive damages is more likely true than not true.
If juries determine that lawyers met that standard, they have no limit on the amount of punitive damages they can award. That has meant high-profile jury awards of tens of millions of dollars, including at a rural hospital in Gallup. 
Hickey said his bill will raise that standard, possibly to as high as “beyond a reasonable doubt,” which is the standard required to convict criminal defendants, and would also cap the amount of awardable punitive damages, he said. 
Thirty-two other states have higher legal standards than New Mexico, and 22 cap punitive damages, according to Think New Mexico.
‘The Michigan Model’
A self-described “geek” about medical malpractice reform, fellow Albuquerque Democratic state Rep. Marianna Anaya told Source that she’s convened a working group composed of doctors and trial lawyers that meets twice a week to “have actual human conversations with one another without degrading one another.”
She told Source she will introduce a bill creating a New Mexico version of the “Michigan Model” for malpractice claims.
The approach emphasizes quick acknowledgment of wrongdoing and compensation instead of long, drawn-out lawsuits. 
As Gallup hospital tries to mend financial wounds, it faces a $68 million judgment

Lawmakers on the Health and Human Services committee heard presenters from Michigan and the University of New Mexico Hospital describe the model as an antidote to the “deny and defend” approach New Mexico and other states currently have toward allegations of medical malpractice. 
One aspect of the legislation would ensure doctors could apologize to patients without incurring additional liability. Those laws adopted elsewhere make doctors or other medical professionals’ apologies after unexpected medical outcomes inadmissible in court. 
Experts last week presented evidence that patients feeling unheard or unseen after  poor medical outcomes can contribute to their pursuit of compensation in court. Enacting so-called “apology laws” as part of a more compassionate approach broadly could reduce the number of medical malpractice claims, Anaya said. 
“To me, that is a great uniter,” Anaya said. “Because if people are talking about lowering the number of lawsuits coming forward, this is proven to do that.”
Senate Bill 8
Recently, Republicans in the Legislature have hosted town halls and railed against Democrats’ inaction on medical malpractice. They also introduced reform legislation during the special legislative session earlier this month, but the bill was never heard due to the narrow agenda. 
Brandon Harris, a spokesperson for Senate Republicans, told Source on Monday that Republicans will likely re-introduce the bill in January. 
“Republicans would prefer a comprehensive bill (such as SB8 from the special session) to address multiple areas of concern with Medical Malpractice in New Mexico,” he wrote in an email. 
Five Senate Republicans sponsored the bill. It would cut down on trial lawyers bringing cases in other, potentially higher-paying judicial districts, a practice Think New Mexico called “venue shopping.” It would also ban lump-sum jury award payments in favor of payments made as expenses are incurred, and it would limit attorney fees, among other changes.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screen-Shot-2025-10-13-at-2.25.31-PM-1024x625.png,,,2025-10-13 16:57:17.853918

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)The Johns family in Brevard lost their home of 25 years in a catastrophic mudslide caused by Hurricane Helene.
Their mortgage was nearly paid off. The family had homeowners insurance, but their claim was denied.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency provided the Johns family with an award of $58,000, which helped with temporary housing needs. About $12,000 of that was designated for personal property replacement and about $42,000 was meant to replace their home.
“You can’t replace a home for $42,000,” Paul Reeves said at the Governor’s Advisory Committee on Western North Carolina Recovery meeting on Monday.
The family received $10,000 from a governor’s grant to prepare the site for rebuilding, according to Reeves, president and CEO of Habitat for Humanity of North Carolina.
Reeves’s organization is bringing in other funding sources to rebuild the Johns family’s home. The new foundation is in, the house is framed, and the Johns family expects to move in by early 2026.
“Just know that the on-the-ground dollars are making a difference and having a huge impact on the families that we serve,” Reeves said.
Habitat for Humanity and Baptists on Mission have used the governor’s grant funds to repair more than 500 homes in western North Carolina, according to Gov. Josh Stein at Monday’s meeting.
When people are waiting to get a roof over their heads, help can’t come fast enough, he said.
“It’s really great because, frankly, [the organizations] move faster than the federal government does,” Stein said. “They immediately stepped up and met the moment.”
But more than a year after Hurricane Helene wreaked havoc on western North Carolina, Stein said there’s still plenty to be done, and more funding is needed to make it happen.
Last month, Stein asked Congress and the Trump administration to send an additional $13.5 billion to North Carolina towards recovery from Helene.
With the federal shutdown headed into a third week, the governor said he’s urged the state’s congressional delegation to work across the aisle for a compromise.
“So far we have been able to maintain our recovery progress… but we cannot continue at this pace indefinitely without a functioning federal government,” Stein said.
Over 300 homeowners have submitted applications to FEMA’s Hazard Mitigation Grant Program since February, but none have been approved, according to Stein.
This program acquires homes in flood prone areas so that residents can use the money to resettle and “move forward with their lives,” Stein said.
“My team and I are asking FEMA, ‘What is the holdup?’ We’re working hard to get some answers,” Stein said.
When he met with Office of Management and Budget director Russell Vought during his trip to Washington in September, Stein asked him to exempt all disaster preparedness and recovery efforts in North Carolina from the ongoing shutdown. There’s no response yet.
Neither the White House nor western NC congressman Chuck Edwards (R-NC11) responded to requests for comment on Stein’s remarks.
While there’s still work to be done, the state has made progress over the past year, Stein’s staff shared at the meeting.
Residents have been approved for more than $524 million in FEMA individual assistance, and more than 6,800 households have received help with temporary housing, according to Matt Calabria, director of the Governor’s Recovery Office for Western North Carolina (GROW NC).
North Carolina is the fastest state in more than a decade to begin rebuilding homes after a major hurricane using funding from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Community Development Block Grand Disaster Recovery program, Calabria shared.
More than 72,000 households have received food assistance and more than 10,000 households have received utility assistance, according to Calabria.
Additionally, families have received over 48,000 higher education scholarships and grants, and 318 public schools have received assistance to replace food and food-related equipment and supplies.
All 13 impacted state parks and five historic sites have reopened either partially or fully.
“It was an internal goal that we get all of these major state assets open for business once again by the one-year mark, which we’re glad to have done,” Calabria said. “This has a significant economic and tourism impact as well, so we’re very grateful for that.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_3427-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-13 16:57:17.853918

MOSCOW, IDAHO – The Rev. Tricia Tedrow was installed as pastor of First Presbyterian Church in Moscow at 3:30 p.m. Sunday at the church, 405 S. Van Buren St. She is the first woman to lead the congregation in its 145-year history.
Tedrow has been preaching and serving the community since August.
“It’s a celebration that the search process is over and we’ve found each other,” Tedrow said.
Mary Read, a church member, said the congregation is thrilled with the match.
“She’s the person who’s going to walk alongside the congregation,” Read said. “She’s very approachable, friendly and down to earth.”
 A path to ministry

Tedrow has served as pastor in churches from Northern Louisiana, Texas, Massachusetts and Arizona. She received a master’s of divinity from Austin Presbyterian Theological Seminary in Austin, Texas, and went on to earn a doctorate in ministry from Luther Seminary in St. Paul, Minnesota. She has served as an interim pastor, pastor and the Congregational Ministry Curriculum Manager on a national level.
“I know this part of the county, and I love this part of the country,” Tedrow said.

She completed her undergraduate degree in history at Whitworth University in Spokane. Tedrow said she had wanted to be a lawyer but while at her home church in New Mexico, she felt called to ministry.
“It’s not something I considered growing up, it wasn’t until after college I felt called,” Tedrow said.
The First Presbyterian Church of Moscow has had 27 pastors since it was founded in September 1880. The previous pastor, the Rev. Norman Fowler, served from October 2005 to May 2024. There were two interim pastors between Fowler’s retirement and Tedrow’s start, which was a husband and wife duo.
 Goals for the future

While Tedrow is the first woman to serve as pastor of the church, she said gender hasn’t been a focus for the congregation. Female pastors are common in the Presbyterian Church (USA), and Tedrow has been the first woman pastor at other congregations.
She said the congregation at First Presbyterian has been open and welcoming. Tedrow said she and the congregations have hopes to continue to strengthen their outreach to the community and revitalize the music program.
“We have hopes to continue to be a strong presence in the community,” Tedrow said.

,DC,2025-10-13 20:25:07+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Nutrition program for women, infants and children to stay afloat through end of month",Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/nutrition-program-women-infants-and-children-stay-afloat-through-end-month,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Agriculture is infusing $300 million into a key federal nutrition program to keep it running through October, while a government shutdown continues without an apparent end point. USDA’s Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children — known as WIC — has relied on short-term funds amid the shutdown. That has worried advocates as states are left to fill the gaps when the money runs out. USDA is transferring $300 million into WIC from its child nutrition programs account, which has long been funded in part by tariff revenue from prior years, according to a congressional aide familiar with the plan. The transfer does not require congressional approval and is expected to keep the program afloat through the end of this month. A USDA spokesperson said in a statement to States Newsroom that the agency “will utilize tariff revenue to fund WIC for the foreseeable future,” though the spokesperson did not offer any specifics. President Donald Trump’s administration had announced the transfer last week but also did not provide much detail. “Our hope is that that money can just get released really swiftly and provide funds to states by next week to prevent further disruptions to WIC,” Georgia Machell, president and CEO of the National WIC Association, told States Newsroom. “Full funding for the program is still the priority here, and it’s great to have short-term solutions, but we need the long-term commitment from Congress to continue funding WIC on a bipartisan basis, which it’s done for decades,” added Machell, whose organization serves as the nonprofit advocacy voice and education arm of WIC. Dependent on congressional approvalThe program serves nearly 7 million people and offers “free healthy foods, breastfeeding support, nutrition education and referrals to other services,” per USDA.But as a discretionary program, WIC is subject to congressional approval each year — making it particularly vulnerable to the ongoing funding lapse.With no funds so far congressionally appropriated for the program in fiscal 2026, which began Oct. 1, WIC has relied on several small pots of money in recent days to keep it running, including USDA’s $150 million contingency fund. States received allocations from that fund.Leftover money for the program from the prior fiscal year was also reallocated to states last week, and was expected to keep WIC operating for several more days. Members of the U.S. Senate were scheduled to vote Tuesday on a stopgap spending bill passed by the House that would reopen the government. But with no deal at hand, it was expected the legislation would again fail to win the support of the 60 senators needed.Senate rebuffs Trump budget cut for WICUSDA’s decision to use the tariff revenue came as Trump has sought to slash part of WIC’s funding in his fiscal 2026 budget request, including taking away “more than $1.3 billion in fruit and vegetable benefits from 5.2 million participants,” according to an estimate from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The full Senate passed its bipartisan bill dealing with Agriculture Department funding, including WIC, back in August. The measure fully funds the program for fiscal 2026 at $8.2 billion and “continues full funding for additional fruit and vegetable benefits,” according to Senate Appropriations Committee Democrats. Meanwhile, the House Appropriations Committee’s version of the bill, which passed out of the Republican-controlled panel in June, provides $7.5 billion for WIC, and includes a “10 percent cut in the cash value vouchers for fruits and vegetables for women and children,” according to the panel’s Democrats. Kate Scully, deputy director of WIC at the Food Research & Action Center, said “we’re still urging Congress to pass a full-year budget that provides WIC the funding it needs to serve everyone who’s eligible for the program and applies, and that includes keeping benefit levels where they are today.” Scully, whose national nonprofit works to reduce poverty-related hunger through research, advocacy and policy solutions, said “families should still utilize their benefits, go to scheduled appointments, but check with their state agency to see if there are any changes.” Scully said her organization is “hearing reports of some places closing,” but that might change with the $300 million infusion of funding. “So, certainly check with your state, but don’t not use your benefits or go to your appointments, because WIC should still be operational.”",,,,2025-10-13 16:57:17.853918

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)Republican lawmakers in North Carolina plan to pass a new congressional map next week to help the GOP maintain its control over Congress in the 2026 midterm elections.
North Carolina House Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell) announced an agreement between state House and Senate leaders to redraw the state’s congressional districts to yield an additional Republican representative from North Carolina.
“President Trump earned a clear mandate from the voters of North Carolina and the rest of the country, and we intend to defend it by drawing an additional Republican Congressional seat,” Hall said in a statement Monday.
There’s little to stand in their way. Passing a new congressional map requires only a simple majority vote in both chambers of the General Assembly, and Republicans hold majorities in both. The new districts are not subject to Stein’s veto. Judicial action is also unlikely, as both the U.S. Supreme Court and North Carolina Supreme Court have held that partisan gerrymandering falls outside of their purview.

Hall cited efforts by California Gov. Gavin Newsom to overturn independent maps in his state to create more Democratic seats, which itself came in response to redistricting at President Donald Trump’s urging in Texas and Missouri.
“Our state won’t stand by while Democrats like Gavin Newsom redraw districts to aid in their efforts to obtain a majority in the U.S. House,” Hall said. “We will not allow them to undermine the will of the voters and President Trump’s agenda.”
Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger (R-Rockingham) — who first floated the idea of a new map last month — said protecting Trump’s agenda requires “safeguarding Republican control of Congress.”
“Picking up where Texas left off, we will hold votes in our October session to redraw North Carolina’s congressional map to ensure Gavin Newsom doesn’t decide the congressional majority,” he said.
House Democratic Leader Robert Reives (D-Chatham) said in a statement that the Republican effort is tantamount to “stealing a congressional district.” He condemned the state GOP for making a rapid push for new maps while failing to fully fund Medicaid.
“Republican lawmakers made clear today that they plan to come back to Raleigh and disenfranchise the voters of this state,” Reives said. “Instead of lowering costs for families or ensuring Medicaid can stay afloat, they are hellbent on consolidating as much power as they can.”
North Carolina Democratic Party Chair Anderson Clayton denounced Berger and Hall directly and said the redistricting effort was “corruption” aimed at shielding Trump from voter backlash.
“North Carolina Republicans Phil Berger and Destin Hall are weak, subservient cowards, willing to steamroll the people of our state so they can give Donald Trump what he wants — power without accountability,” she said. “Let me be clear: maps should not give you power; voters should.”
North Carolina’s Congressional Districts (Map: NCGA)
North Carolina’s congressional map already heavily favors Republicans, with 53% of the congressional vote giving Republicans a 10-4 majority in the House delegation. Only Rep. Don Davis (D-N.C.) holds a competitive seat, winning by less than 2% of the vote in the state’s 1st Congressional District in 2024.
The announcement comes weeks after a poll commissioned by Common Cause North Carolina found 84% of voters in the state oppose gerrymandering, including 78% of Republicans.
Melissa Price Kromm, chair of voter advocacy group North Carolina For The People, criticized the move as harmful to voters, calling instead for systemic reform and redistricting led by independent commissions.
“These new redistricting wars aren’t about fairness; they’re about power,” she said in a statement. “Every time politicians redraw maps to cling to power, trust in our democracy erodes.”
Kromm said “it’s telling” that House and Senate Republicans are able to come to a speedy agreement on redistricting while failing to pass a state budget. “They’re prioritizing power over people, again,” she said.
Stein said in September that the prospect of mid-decade redistricting in North Carolina is “ridiculous” and damaging to democracy.
“We just redistricted for the second time last cycle. So every two years is the theory that we’re gonna redistrict, so we can maximize the political advantage to stick it to one party and enhance another party?” Stein said. “We cannot get into this maximalist political power worldview because it will destroy this country.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_0870-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-13 16:57:17.853918

(Henry Redman | Wisconsin Examiner)To celebrate Indigenous People’s Day, Democrats in the Wisconsin Assembly announced a package of bills Monday that would grant rights to Devil’s Lake State Park and reinstitute a law that effectively banned mining. 
The proposal to grant “rights of nature” to Wisconsin’s most popular state park comes just months after a group of Republicans introduced legislation that would prevent local governments in the state from enacting similar legislation. The Milwaukee County Board passed a rights of nature resolution promising to protect the Menominee, Milwaukee and Fox rivers and Lake Michigan. The Green Bay city council is also currently working on a rights of nature resolution. 
Under the bill, Devil’s Lake has the right to “flourish, evolve, and be clean.” The bill gives the state attorney general the authority to enforce the law against people who infringe on the park’s rights and allows anyone to sue or intervene in a lawsuit in the name of the park to enforce the park’s rights. Anyone who infringes on the park’s rights by damaging the environment will be liable to pay damages to restore the park to its previous state. 
In addition to the Devil’s Lake bill, the package includes a joint resolution acknowledging that “nature has inherent rights” and the state of Wisconsin “has a duty to uphold those rights as part of its enduring conservation legacy and its responsibility to future generations.” 
The resolution also states that the Legislature won’t pass laws preventing local rights of nature ordinances.
The Republican bill preempting local rights of nature efforts is “anti-free speech, it’s anti-democratic,” Rep. Vincent Miresse (D-Stevens Point), one of the bills’ co-authors, told the Wisconsin Examiner. “Whereas our bill is, ‘Hey, let’s get this on the docket and actually have a productive conversation, actually bring in stakeholders about what it means to look at nature actually having rights.’”
Miresse said the more symbolic measures passed by local governments are important statements of values, but he wanted the bill to have “teeth.” 
“I would like to move beyond mission and vision statements. I think those are great for guiding principles and taking us in the right direction and keeping our mission and vision top of mind when we are creating and drafting policy at the local level. And I want to make sure they have a right to do that regardless of what the preemption bill would do,” Miresse said. “However, when we were looking at this in terms of crafting policy and changing statute, there would be some teeth here.”
Miresse said the bill is targeted only at Devil’s Lake, rather than all the bodies of water in Wisconsin, because it was simplest to start with a piece of nature that has defined political boundaries already under the state’s control. 
In their preemption bill, Republicans Rep. Joy Goeben (R-Hobart) and Sen. Steve Nass (R-Whitewater) argued that laws granting rights to nature posed a “dangerous shift in legal precedent” that would result in “threatening property rights, stalling development, and burdening the judicial system.”
Democrats counter that granting legal rights to a park or a body of water isn’t much different than granting First Amendment rights to a corporation — which Republicans successfully argued for in court cases such as Citizens United. 
Also announced Monday is a proposal to reinstate Wisconsin’s “prove it first” mining law, which requires that in order to obtain a permit from the Department of Natural Resources, mining companies must prove the mine can be operated for 10 years and be shuttered for 10 years without harmful effects on the local environment. The law was enacted in 1997 until Republicans repealed it in 2017. U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany, a Republican gubernatorial candidate, authored the bill to repeal the mining ban when he was in the state Senate. 
This year, a Canadian company has begun exploratory drilling projects in the state, potentially leading to the first operating mines in Wisconsin for the first time in decades. 
Miresse said he wants decisions about mining to consider local environmental health rather than just being about “dollars and cents.”

Rep. Taylor Collins, R-Mediapolis, and Sen. Lynn Evans, R-Aurelia, sent a letter Sunday to the Board of Regents asking the body to join the Compact for Excellence in Higher Education, developed by President Donald Trump and his administration, “as soon as possible.”
“Iowa has a chance to be a leader in higher education reform by having our universities be the first to sign on to this compact,” the letter stated.

Board of Regents spokesperson Josh Lehman said in an email the board received the letter from Collins and Evans and is reviewing the compact.
Published in its entirety by the Washington Post, the compact lists the benefits the higher education system receives from its “extraordinary relationship with the U.S. government,” including direct and indirect research funding, student loans, grant funding and other contracts, approval of visas for students and university officials, and “preferential treatment under the tax code.”
Universities that do not wish to follow the eight rules of the compact — which span admissions, hiring, discourse on campus, finances and more — do not have to, the compact document stated, “if the institution elects to (forgo) federal benefits.”
The compact directs universities to not allow demographics like “sex, ethnicity, race, nationality, political views, sexual orientation, gender identity, religious associations, or proxies for any of those factors” to impact student admission or hiring decisions, unless excused by federal law or exempted by the fact that an institution is religious or single-sex.
Colleges that opt in to the compact would have to freeze tuition for five years, according to the document, and disclose any and all foreign funding. Institutions would not be allowed to have more than 15% of their undergraduate student body come through the Student Visa Exchange Program, of which no one country can represent more than 5% of the population.
Other rules of the compact include committing to institutional neutrality and ensuring “no single ideology” is dominant on campus by having varying viewpoints by “revising governance structures as necessary.” The compact also directs universities to grade and discipline students equally, and define “male” and “female” by “reproductive function and biological processes.”
“These common sense reforms would not only be welcome news for Iowa students and taxpayers, but joining this compact would greatly benefit Iowa’s universities by giving them preferred access to federal funding,” Collins’ and Evans’ letter stated.
Universities in the compact would be required to conduct an annual poll of students and staff to “evaluate the university’s performance against this compact,” the document stated, and results will be published online. The U.S. Department of Justice will oversee the compact, and universities found in violation will lose access to its benefits for one year, to start.
Multiple universities have already stated they will not join the compact, including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology — one of nine institutions specifically invited to sign on.
The American Council on Education, American Association of Colleges and Universities and Association of Governing Boards of Universities and Colleges have also released statements saying the compact threatens university independence and academic freedom.

(Photo by Lidija Kamansky/Getty Images)With fall weather dampening wildland fire conditions in Washington, officials are beginning to reflect on the fire season. 
Washington state saw more individual fires than last season, but fewer acres burned, preliminary data shows. Several sizable fires are still burning. 
As of Oct. 10, there were 251,840 acres burned in Washington state and 1,851 documented ignitions, according to Northwest Interagency Coordination Center data released by the state Department of Natural Resources. 
The data is not specific to Department of Natural Resources-managed lands, and encompasses wildland fire activity across all of Washington state. 
The numbers include the current acreage for the two fires still burning in Central Washington, as well as several other active fires across the state. 
The Labor Mountain fire and the Lower Sugarloaf fire in Central Washington were both partially contained as of Monday afternoon. 
The Bear Gulch fire in the Olympic National Forest is also still burning, but fire management personnel determined last week that the threat of further damage from the fire is minimal. The Tunnel Creek fire, similarly, has mostly stopped growing due to the shift in weather. 
The total acreage burned so far this year is below last year’s total of 274,593 acres and the five-year average of 423,436 acres. 
“Unless something unexpected happens, Washington state will likely experience slightly fewer or a similar number of total acres burned statewide as last year,” said Department of Natural Resources spokesperson Thomas Kyle-Milward
Fire ignitions, however, are higher than last year’s total of 1,806 and the five-year average of 1,629. 
Ignitions include anything that starts a fire, such as weather, human activity, and undetermined causes. False alarm reports are not included in the data. 
Kyle-Milward described this year’s wildland fire season as “average to above-average,” noting that fire activity was consistent with projections for the season. 
Finalized data for 2025 will be released in January. 
With temperatures mellowing and rain beginning to fall, the Department of Natural Resources does not expect any further fire activity in Central and Eastern Washington this season. 
“Fall weather is mitigating conditions,” said Kyle-Milward. 
Because conditions have become favorable, the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife announced last week that it plans to start conducting prescribed burns on the lands it manages in Eastern Washington. 
The agency conducts prescribed fires during conditions that favor low-intensity burning, such as in the spring and fall, to improve ecosystem health and reduce the risk for future catastrophic wildfires. 
“Fire rejuvenates important native grass and brush favored by deer and elk, as well as small mammals and bird species, while providing improved ecosystem health and resiliency, reduced wildfire intensity, and improved access for recreational users,” said Matt Eberlein, prescribed fire program manager with the Department of Fish and Wildlife. 
The agency plans to treat 300 acres on the L.T. Murray Unit of the L.T. Murray Wildlife Area about 15 miles west of Ellensburg. It will also partner with Chelan County, the U.S. Forest Service, and the Washington Department of Natural Resources to treat 36 acres in the Stemilt Basin in the Colockum Wildlife Area.
Additional burns on Department of Fish and Wildlife-managed Eastern Washington lands may be announced later this fall. 
All burns are weather-dependent and will not occur if conditions are not optimal for safe and effective prescribed fires, Fish and Wildlife stated. 
The Department of Natural Resources launched its own prescribed fire program in 2021, when state lawmakers approved a bill committing $500 million over eight years  for wildfire preparedness and response. 
State spending largely kept up with that target until this year. 
The Department of Natural Resources was adequately prepared for this year’s fire season, but used funding left over from previous years to do so. 
Public Lands Commissioner Dave Upthegrove, who oversees the department, is asking the Legislature to backfill $60 million for fire prevention efforts, including tree thinning and prescribed burns, that was shortchanged in the last legislative session. 
He is also asking for an additional $44.8 million for wildfire fighting for the 2026 fiscal year, which runs through next June.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/cedar-creek-fire-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-13 16:57:17.853918

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont novel “Stolen Mountain” explores ski area fraud.","In I.M. Aiken’s latest novel, EMS captain turned sleuth Brighid Doran suspects that all is not as it appears at The Branston Club, a swanky ski lodge being built in her rural Vermont town. When neighbors start going hungry and local businesses are threatened, Brighid sets to investigating the club’s charismatic developer, coming up against crooked cops, greedy politicians, and a string of increasingly depraved deceptions—all while struggling to cope with the deployment of her wife, Major Sarah Ann (“Sam”) Musgrave. With help from attorney Morgan Harmon and the FBI, Brighid must uncover the scheme defrauding her community of millions, even if it puts her own life on the line.
Stolen Mountain is available October 21st in bookstores everywhere.
Reader: I.M., thanks for chatting with me. Where did the idea for Stolen Mountain come from?
Aiken: I watched the brewing of two large fraud cases in Vermont in recent decades: one in Wilmington and Dover, and the other near the Canadian border at Jay Peak. From an outsider’s perspective, it seemed as if the cases were unrelated, but the similarities were striking. Two Vermont ski areas, efforts to steal funds from local citizens and businesses, influencing state officials with tax programs and photo-ops, and other tricks common to the fraudster’s toolkit.
As I researched one case, facts from the other case would bleed in. I used the stillness of the pandemic year to travel to these projects, interviewing victims, studying local documents and newspapers, and photographing the sites. 
Stolen Mountain focuses primarily on the case involving Haystack Mountain, and the developers of The Hermitage Club. Haystack was a small and private ski area in Wilmington and Dover. The vision of The Hermitage, as explained in the local papers, was to create an exclusive resort for wealthy patrons who would fly in and out of a local airport. But the locals paid a hefty price.
Reader: “Ripped from the headlines,” as they say?
Aiken: Inspired, yes. Faithful to the facts? No. Stolen Mountain is fiction, because if I stuck with the facts, my readers would hate me. Fraud is actually very boring and predictable. Con cons locals and politicians with grand ideas, gets great deals, starts doing things, then “forgets” to pay bills. The bad guy decides he’s too big to fail and the local economy is suddenly dependent on his project, employment scheme, and investment. The real bad guy simply walked away with the money. In my book, I am just not that forgiving. There are a few fun twists and turns. 
Reader: Your main character, Brighid, is a lot of fun to read. Tell me about her. This isn’t the first time your loyal readers will meet her, is it?
Aiken: I wanted to expand on two of my favorite secondary characters from my previous novel The Little Ambulance War of Winchester County, released last year. Our hero, Brighid, is an advanced EMT and captain on the rescue squad in her fictitious town of Trowbridge, Vermont. She comes with classic Yankee moxie and keeps getting interrupted by 911 calls. Her wife, Sam, is a career army officer. For those in the know, I have been publishing short stories monthly on Substack, where readers can get to know Brighid, Sam, and the Trowbridge rescue squad. The stories are free. You can find them here: https://TrowbridgeDispatch.IamAiken.com. Each story stands alone and can be read in any order. I just keep writing about the same people in the same places while ignoring timelines.
Reade: So tell me more about the plot of Stolen Mountain. Obviously, Brighid is investigating this big fraud. What else is going on?
Aiken: Twenty years ago, I reported for duty at the military base in Killeen, Texas, the then-home of the U.S. Army’s 4th Infantry Division. I was a civilian assigned into a military unit as a subject matter expert. My boss was a major, and together we managed a platoon of fifteen soldiers and one coast guard member. When I was deployed overseas, the military had already dismissed nearly 5,000 service members for being queer. The timeline of the original Hermitage fraud case straddled the reversal of “Don’t Ask-Don’t Tell,” so the discrimination against queer soldiers is woven tightly into the novel. Of course, when drafting this work, I assumed that these days were behind us. Suddenly, exploring queer folks in public service and military roles seems contemporary.
Also, I questioned why Vermont was a target for two large fraud cases that related to land, development, and ski areas. Although I offer no blame, I did explore how Vermont reviews and approves development projects. We run them through environmental reviews during the permitting process. While writing, I researched how Vermont investigates financial crimes. I didn’t find much.
I wonder if financial integrity ought to be as important as environmental planning. As a novelist, I can explore these questions freely (I hope, still).
And because I have been in public service since my teen years, I’ve tossed in my normal 911 and rescue squad antics and drama. Bringing the spice to everyday community heroes we find in Vermont towns.
Reader: Where can readers find the book?
Aiken: It will be available at any bookstore from October 21st. I have a funny feeling that booksellers near Jay Peak and The Hermitage Club will have abundant inventory. I encourage folks to buy the audiobook, which is read by me. It can be found on Libro.fm or any other place where audiobooks are sold.

Patrick Morrisey signed a bill into law that will ban food containing some artificial food dyes from being sold in West Virginia starting on Jan. 1, 2028. (Leann Ray | West Virginia Watch)The International Association of Color Manufacturers is suing West Virginia health and school leaders over a new state law that bans certain artificial food dyes from being included in food items sold in school lunches. 
The group is asking a judge to strike down the requirement. 
Republican lawmakers behind the bill, which passed earlier this year, said the synthetic red, blue, green and yellow dyes — commonly in candy, cereal and soda — are unnecessary and harmful. Gov. Patrick Morrisey signed the measure into law in March. 
In the lawsuit, the association says the West Virginia Legislature acted unlawfully in passing House Bill 2354 by asserting their power over the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which has the authority to make food safety decisions. 
The suit was filed Oct. 6 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia against the state’s health secretary, Arvin Singh, state schools Superintendent Michele Blatt and state school board members by name. West Virginia Bureau for Health Interim Commissioner Justin Davis was also named as a defendant. 
“By expressly naming and prohibiting the targeted color additives without any rational basis for finding that they are, in fact, unsafe in any way, HB 2354 violates the equal protection guarantees under the U.S. and West Virginia Constitutions,” the lawsuit said. “The Court should declare the law unconstitutional and enjoin its enforcement.”
The legislation banned the use of seven artificial dyes — Red No. 3, Red No. 40, Yellow No. 5, Yellow No. 6, Blue No. 1, Blue No. 2 and Green No. 3 — in school meals beginning Aug. 1 and is currently being implemented in schools statewide. Some lawmakers linked the dyes to behavioral issues in children. 
The dyes would be prohibited along with the preservatives butylated hydroxyanisole and propylparaben, in drugs and food items for sale in the state beginning Jan. 1, 2028.
Morrisey and other Republican supporters of the bill have linked to the Trump administration’s “Make American Healthy Again” movement. Shortly after the legislation passed in West Virginia, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced his intention for the country’s food industry to phase out artificial dyes. They want the industry to swap out the dyes for natural alternatives.
But IACM maintains that there’s no scientific evidence showing that the dyes are harmful when consumed. The group’s website includes information on why colors are safe and how they’re regulated, saying the color additives are subject to extensive safety assessment as described by the FDA.
In the lawsuit, IACM also said that manufacturers of color additives and manufacturers of products which use those additives “will suffer irreparable harm, both through the deprivations of their constitutional protections as well as the significant economic costs that the law will impose on them.”
Before lawmakers signed off on the bill, the state’s food and beverage industry pushed back on the measure with paid advertisements, warning that it would lead to increased grocery prices and empty shelves. Alternative ingredients don’t exist to scale, they said.

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)About three dozen people gathered under cloudy skies at the Indian Pueblo Cultural Center in Albuquerque Monday morning to see the first traditional dance performances for Indigenous Peoples Day.
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham in 2019 declared the second Monday in October Indigenous Peoples Day, and an official state holiday.
The Pueblo Dance Group, which includes members from the Pueblos of Laguna, Acoma, Zuni and Hopi Tribe, opened the celebration Monday morning. One of the group’s founders’ Chris Charlie (Laguna Pueblo) noted the group performed at the International Balloon Fiesta earlier in the week and would be heading for New York City for another performance this month.
‘We’re here to entertain you guys and bless you,” Charlie said to the crowd of about three dozen assembled to watch the dances.
In Santa Fe, the celebration began over the weekend, with dancers from numerous tribes leading into a Monday Honoring Native Nations Powwow on the Plaza.

Kathryn Keyope (Acoma Pueblo) told Source NM that the holiday provided an opportunity to bring “a little bit more awareness… just to spread knowledge [and] bring a …awareness to everybody around us that comes to visit. We are getting a lot more non-Natives who come and watch us perform, so we definitely appreciate that they enjoy seeing us keeping our roots.”
Her husband Johnathan Keyope noted that they are able to share that history not just with visitors to New Mexico, but in other communities as well. “Some of the areas when we perform back east, local tribes are just far and few in between. So it’s great that we can share ourselves…to educate and to give everyone awareness and knowledge that we’re still here, and we do this; to  let people know of our beautiful history and our beautiful culture.”









 The Pueblo Dance Group was founded nearly 10 years ago, by Chris Charlie (Laguna Pueblo) this Christmas and includes dancers and singers from various Pueblos and tribal nations in New Mexico. 










 Marcy Quam, 69, and husband Delbert Quam drove two and half hours from Zuni Pueblo to watch their son perform with the Pueblo Dance Group. ‘It’s important for us Indigenous people to come together and celebrate our day, we can enjoy watching our family, seeing the dances,’ Marcy Quam said.

(Photo by Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)MEDORA, N.D. – Public lands advocate Walt Dabney joined a group of North Dakota conservationists in the Badlands on Sunday to see how federal funding cuts are affecting public lands in the state — and how members of the public are stepping up in the government’s place.
Dabney, a former National Park Service ranger, is in North Dakota this week to deliver a series of talks about the importance of public lands and conservation. 
His career included stints at Yellowstone, Grand Teton, Yosemite, Grand Teton, Everglades and Mount Rainier, eventually serving as superintendent and chief ranger of the National Park Service. But until Sunday, he had never been hiking in the North Dakota Badlands.
Dabney, 79, retired from the U.S. National Park Service in 2010 after 43 years of service. He now spends his time advocating for the National Park System.
He said he’s worried about the future of the parks.
Federal agencies like the National Park Service, the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management have had their staffs reduced under the Trump administration. Thousands of remaining workers are on furlough during the ongoing government shutdown.
As a result, there are fewer people taking care of the trails.

Conservationists on the hike pointed out several areas where deferred maintenance on federal land — like unaddressed erosion — made it harder and less safe to traverse.
But Dabney’s hosts were proud to show him a new bridge on the 144-mile Maah Daah Hey Trail. The wooden bridge, which crosses Bear Creek and was installed in July, replaced an old one that had collapsed after a storm in 2023.
The project was a team effort between Dakota Prairie Grasslands staff, conservation groups and volunteers. 
Dakota Prairie Grasslands applied to get a mule train to get materials to the bridge site. Staff also borrowed equipment from the state of North Dakota to reroute part of the trail to the new bridge.
The combined support allowed Dakota Prairie Grasslands workers to complete the project in a matter of days rather than months.
“What Walt talks about in his talk, this is a great example of that,” Shannon Straight, executive director of the Badlands Conservation Alliance, said during the hike.
Dabney said the purpose of his tour is to educate the public about the origin of the National Park System, what parks offer the American public and why he thinks they must be protected.

He said his talk is partly a response to efforts to transfer federal land to states.
As part of this movement, Utah along with a group of other Republican-led state last year sued the federal government over millions of acres of public land controlled by the Bureau of Land Management. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case.
Dabney will be delivering three talks in North Dakota: one Tuesday evening at Dickinson State University’s Beck Auditorium, another Wednesday evening at the North Dakota Heritage Center in Bismarck and the last on Thursday evening University of North Dakota’s Gorecki Alumni Center in Grand Forks.
Dabney said he’s using his voice in part because federal park workers can’t. Mass layoffs and funding cuts in the executive branch have made it so that rank-and-file park federal employees are afraid to express themselves, he said.
He urged them to keep a low profile so they have a chance to keep their jobs. The federal government needs to retain employees who care about public lands, he said.
“Do your job, take care of each other, take care of the visitor,” he said. “You can only fall on your sword once.”



Walt Dabney will visit three North Dakota cities this week. The public events start at 6:30 p.m. with a film, followed by a question-and-answer segment with Dabney. 
The dates and locations are:

Tuesday at Dickinson State University’s Beck Auditorium
Wednesday at the North Dakota Heritage Center in Bismarck
Thursday at the University of North Dakota’s Gorecki Alumni Center in Grand Forks

Gov. George S. Mickelson and the Legislature created the annual holiday in 1990. They chose the second Monday in October, which is federally designated as Columbus Day. The effort was part of a broader Year of Reconciliation proclaimed by Mickelson at the urging of Native American newspaper publisher Tim Giago.
The following is an excerpt from a speech that Mickelson delivered Oct. 8, 1990, at Crazy Horse Memorial on South Dakota’s first Native Americans’ Day. He began by speaking in Lakota, and then provided the English translation for the traditional greeting:

Today, I stand before for you and shake your hand with a happy heart. And today that really takes on extra meaning as we stand here and make history.
Chief Standing Bear made a statement long ago that became the theme of the Council for Reconciliation. It is hard for us to imagine, but it was the attitude in 1879 that it had to legally be decided in this country, in this nation, whether or not Indians were people under the law, in the context of an issue that was being decided at that time.

And there was a judge by the name of [Elmer] Dundy who was sitting in judgment on Chief Standing Bear when Chief Standing Bear made a point that is the theme for the year of reconciliation. And what Standing Bear told Judge Dundy was, “My hand is not the color of your hand, but if you pierce it, I shall feel the pain. The blood that will flow from mine will be the same color as yours. I am a man. The Great Spirit made us both.”
The Great Spirit made us both. That concept is what Native American Day is all about. The Great Spirit made us, but years of turmoil, years of misunderstanding, years of mistrust have built walls between us and have made separate nations within the same state.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I’m not so naive to believe — and I know that you aren’t either — that we can turn back the clock of history by a hundred years and undo those things that have gone on in the past.
But what this day represents, and what we can do, is both turn to the future together and face it. We can reason together. We can negotiate. We can reach deep into our hearts for compassion. We can reach down and have a better understanding and trust of each other, and we can make a better life for ourselves and our children.
The most important thing to remember about today is that it is just a beginning. It is a foundation upon which to build friendship and trust.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_1566-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-13 15:57:24.266942

Bailey’s passion for emergency response began with a childhood moment in a firefighter’s helmet. From Junior Firefighter to EMT, he’s built his skills, with the help of leadership training. Now, he’s working toward a career as a firefighter—driven by purpose, community, and the joy of inspiring the next generation.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Answerin[...]","Bailey Shepard vividly remembers the sense of belonging he felt the first time he put on a firefighter’s helmet. It was a weekend day, and his family was at the Berlin Mall. Out in the parking lot, the fire department had brought trucks and tankers for kids to see up close. Bailey eagerly slipped on a firefighter’s coat and helmet. “It felt amazing,” he recalled. “I still have a picture of that. I instantly knew that’s where I belonged.”
Many departments allow recruits as young as 16. “I joined the minute I could,” he said. Bailey showed up at the Wolcott Volunteer Fire Department, ready to work as a Junior Firefighter.
“Junior means you’re the gofer, getting things from the truck,” he explained. Bailey spent those first two years hauling equipment and learning the ropes before earning his spot as a Senior Firefighter. “Senior Firefighters are more involved in the scene. It could be anything from a smoke detector going off with nothing happening to an emergency response for a flood.”
Learning leadership
A few years before he was able to join the fire department, Bailey attended a SEEDS leadership retreat at Vermont State University Lyndon. Offered by VSAC, the SEEDS Training Leadership Program focuses on building skills like teamwork and resilience. It was through SEEDS that Bailey was motivated to keep building his abilities—and his confidence. 
“SEEDS training inspired me quite a bit,” Bailey said. “A lot of leadership is needed in firefighting and EMS work. In EMS you’re the one in charge of a patient. That program helped me build more leadership skills.”
Bailey’s VSAC outreach program counselors, Michelle Legere and Lindsay Carpenter, worked with him through high school, helping him plan for a possible pathway to college. For a while Bailey thought he might go into music education—he played trombone and several other instruments—but eventually his passion for emergency response took over. While in high school, he also completed construction technology training at Green Mountain Technology & Career Center, earning certifications and credits that gave him options after graduation. 
“He is such a helper,” noted Michelle. “He’s been a devoted volunteer and community member from day one. I remember these business cards he made, advertising Bailey’s Helping Service. It really speaks to who he is, this great person who is always there and always helping others.”

Flood response, a defining moment
In July 2023 (as with many of his fellow first responders) Bailey found himself swimming through floodwater, checking on stranded vehicles. The night started with a call about a tree on a powerline and escalated as the storms overwhelmed local rivers. “You never know what’s coming,” Bailey said. “The whole night, we must have had twelve or more calls… that’s a lot for a volunteer department.”
In one case, a propane tank floated downriver, propelled near a home by the raging waters. Bailey suited up in full gear with a self-contained breathing apparatus to make sure the scene was safe.
That December, there was another flood in Wolcott. Bailey and another firefighter swam through the Lamoille River to reach a car stuck on Elmore Pond Road. “Someone came to the fire station saying there was a car flagging people down for help. We responded. I went in with someone else—we had to swim through the water to go rescue them.”
The floods were a landmark moment for Bailey and stand out to this day as his “why”: it’s the response work that resonates most with him and fuels his passion. Each call brings a different challenge; “You never know if it’s a stubbed toe or a house fully on fire,” he says. 
Answering the call
Three and a half years into firefighting, Bailey earned his EMT license and added ambulance calls to his schedule. “I knew I wanted that,” he says. After a free EMT class, he joined Hardwick Rescue, where he’s now volunteered for almost two years. He also serves with Woodbury Fire & Rescue, which covers both fire and EMS.
All of this work is carried out by volunteers. “Radios and pagers are always on me. Phone too. For Hardwick Rescue I have shifts. Woodbury I’m always on call,” Bailey said. “But we’re volunteers, and some days we don’t have coverage, and the call goes to a different department, further away. We’re always recruiting more people. We need them.”
On top of his two volunteer roles, Bailey works full time as crew at Smugglers’ Notch Resort, doing maintenance and a variety of support tasks.
Looking ahead
Today, Bailey’s goal is clear: he hopes to turn his volunteer service into a full-time career as a firefighter and EMT. “I’d love to do it full time. I’m just waiting for one to open up somewhere,” he says.
Through it all, he credits the support and leadership development he received from his VSAC Outreach Counselors and the SEEDS program. “A big part of the job is taking charge in emergency response situations. I use those leadership skills I built with VSAC almost every day,” he shared.
And even after long nights and unpredictable calls, Bailey still finds his greatest joy in sharing the excitement with kids. “It’s the best feeling in the world,” he said. “Showing a kid around a fire truck, in the back of an ambulance, putting the helmet on them. Their smiles are so big. If you have tough days, that’s what you have to go do.” It’s a full-circle moment for Bailey, whose own path began with that same early encounter.

The state’s Democrats in the same budget also embraced Trump’s no tax on tips, overtime and Social Security platform, which was enshrined in the current 2025-26 fiscal year budget.
Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed the multi-pronged spending plan last week, a full seven days past the start of the current fiscal year.
Whitmer signs $81B budget for Fiscal Year 2026, including funding for road fixes and public schools

Among the flurry of budget pieces signed by Whitmer was House Bill 4961, one of several tax generating bills separate from the packages that drove most of the negotiations. The legislation combined the tax decoupling component and the policy for “no tax on” tips, overtime and Social Security.
The move to sever Michigan’s tax rules means new money for roads and the state avoiding a giant revenue hole. But some businesses might end up paying more in state taxes and find themselves burdened by a confusing system, according to business groups that opposed the decoupled tax aspect of the new fiscal year budget.
That said, at least one economic expert told Michigan Advance that the notion of decoupling was a radical new step for Michigan.
“I think it’s important to point out that there are several what we call static states, and they don’t necessarily follow whatever the IRS passes in a given budget year, unless they specifically pass their own law affirming that they are going to do that, and so Michigan is one of them,” said Tyler Theile, vice president and director for public policy with East Lansing-based Anderson Economic Group. “So, it would be false to think, ‘oh, the majority of states are all following this tax code, and now Michigan is very, very unique that we’ve decoupled.’ That’s not really the case.”
Businesses who partner with universities might have a tougher time, however.
Trump’s tax plan upended Michigan budget talks
In the heat of Michigan’s budget standoff, which lasted months and featured a very public fight with House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township), the Democratic Senate held numerous committees examining the downstream effects of Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Those conversations flipped the table on the federal revenue question.
Trump’s legislation made significant federal tax changes, all hailed by Republicans as ways to grow the national economy, with a large emphasis on boosting research and development through modified expense and deduction rules. It also made Trump’s 2017 federal tax cuts permanent as they were set to expire at the end of this year.
Michigan has a flat income tax rate unlike the federal government’s progressive rate, but the two tax codes long mirrored each other for the sake of simplicity. The relationship meant some anticipated Trump’s tax relief to trickle down. Trump’s tax plan would have ultimately let businesses pay an estimated $680 million in fewer Michigan taxes, one of the revenue holes Democrats spent months warning about.
Revenue maintained by breaking the state and federal tax link will start hitting Michigan coffers in the current fiscal year, starting with $688 million in 2025-26, and escalating to $1.04 billion in the 2029-30 fiscal year.
Halting some federal tax effects flipped the revenue table, again
House Bill 4961, now Public Act 24 of 2025, alters the way federal income tax is calculated at the state level, and some new sections of the federal tax code modified by Trump’s plan will either be outright disregarded or shifted.
The most impactful changes govern depreciation for qualified property to spur capital investments through construction; another restoring current or two-year out deductions on domestic research and development; and others dealing with interest on non-cash, pre-tax or pre-depreciation expenses.
Several business groups opposed Michigan’s tax changes to serve a balanced budget, including the Michigan Chamber of Commerce, which produced an analysis of the anticipated impacts.
In the chamber’s view, breaking the link between the state and federal codes could very well impose an up to $2 billion tax hike on business over the next five years. The move also creates a more complex and confusing tax environment, which the chamber believed would be detrimental for Michigan employers.
Some have argued that new rules only offset Trump’s reforms by a few years as a transition period, and that it was simply a timing change. Not so, in the chamber’s view.
“Unless Michigan law is changed, this decoupling is permanent, leaving Michigan companies paying higher state taxes while competitors in neighboring states continue to benefit from these reforms,” the chamber wrote.
The business group said it was probing state lawmakers to see where changes could be made and if they were open to restoring alignment with Trump’s tax plans.
Whitmer embraces Trump’s ‘no tax on’ mantra
Shoehorned into Public Act 24 are three tax carveouts that Republicans and Trump have been championing since 2024 – zero taxes on tips, overtime pay and social security.
Among the “now tax on” mantras’ biggest supporters were Hall and state Rep. Ann Bollin (R-Brighton Township), chair of the House Appropriations Committee. When the budget deal emerged, the concept gained another key supporter: the Democratic governor of Michigan.
In a news release announcing that she signed the budget, and with zero line item vetoes, Whitmer highlighted the new tax aspects as a win for Michiganders. Later in the week, Whitmer’s office put out a second news release heralding what has been a major Trump Republican talking point.
“By ending taxes on tips, overtime, and Social Security, we’re putting money back in the pockets of hundreds of thousands of Michiganders, so they can pay the bills and put food on the table,” Whitmer said.

A breakdown from Whitmer’s executive office said that 300,000 residents could save an average of $400 on their state taxes from no tax on tips, or $1,500 a year when combined with Trump’s no tax on tips at the federal level.
No taxes on overtime could save up to 500,000 Michigan workers an average of $500 a year in state taxes, or $2,000 when combined with the federal analog.
Eligible senior citizens collecting social security payments could also save an average of $500 a year in taxes. Whitmer’s team did not break down the federal social security tax savings in its analysis.
Hall, in a news conference last week giving his post-mortem take on the budget process, similarly hailed the inclusion of the Republican “no tax on” deals.

Process changes could be the biggest new tax hurdle
Theile told the Advance that the biggest burden facing businesses would likely appear in the process of filing, and not necessarily in the tax benefits they might not get.
“You need to keep track of it a little bit differently,” Theile said. “That’s always problematic when policy is put into place that creates extra steps that are tedious or confusing.”
It also opens the door for error, and those errors could be expensive.
Some legislators have said the decoupling change was meant to give Michigan some time to before the immediate changes took hold. Theile said she hopes that was true, because the research and development impact could be pronounced and was one to watch down the road.
“What we do really need in Michigan is to appear as competitive among peer states,” she said. “One of the ways we know we need to work hard in doing that is by encouraging businesses to spend on R&D and innovation, and to partner with our research universities on innovation.”
Theile said Michigan has shown progress meeting that goal, but the state still has a disproportionate number of highly educated, highly technical young people leaving.
“Part of that is because we don’t have the business investment and infrastructure capital here that creates angel investment pipelines, or other types of really innovation focused pipelines,” she said. “We can’t afford to fall any further behind.”
Awkward conversations abound as election cycle looms
Both sides of the political aisle in Michigan netted clear political wins in the state’s budget battle, but they could also take heavy punches on the areas where they caved. The tax implications of the state budget may drive some of the discontent, aside from the controversial 24% wholesale tax on marijuana sales, which is now the subject of a court battle and much dissension in the cannabis community.

Adrian Hemond, CEO of the Grassroots Midwest political consulting firm, told the Advance that Republicans who voted for the tax changes should expect some questions.
“There was not really any consultation with the business community about this, particularly, our businesses that are super capital and research intensive that we’re looking forward to and planning for tax relief at the state level,” Hemond said. “This was sort of sprung on them at the last minute. … They could look forward to this tax relief in an accelerated fashion, because we were coupled to the feds. Now they’re not going to get that.”
Hemond said that Republicans who traditionally look to the business community for funding might have some uncomfortable conversations ahead.
Hall blamed Democrats for the changes in the tax rules in a news conference last week, but the bill was notably introduced by Bollin, and the decoupling aspect was not put into the bill by any late-game amendment from the Senate. 
For Democrats, staving off the worst effects of Trump’s tax cuts might help them polish their anti-Trump resumes, Hemond said.
To the talking point that the change was permanent and not simply a timing shift, Hemond said that the latter was true – but only if you’re not a business owner who was planning on new tax relief for months on end.
“It’s costing you a lot of money in the short term,” he said. “Whether you think the chamber is right here or not, it’s objectively true that any further business tax relief to spur investment, you’re not going to take advantage of that unless you have a big political fight in Lansing to try and win it [back].”
As for Whitmer and the Democrats’ group hug around “no tax on” tips, etc., Hemond believed that would be a far less bitter pill to swallow.
“The budget process is always a negotiation,” he said. “This is something that Republicans clearly wanted and there’s not a political cost to Democrats giving it to them. There’s objectively a cost to the state budget. Republicans can certainly claim it as a win, because for Republicans who have to face a primary election, they are hewing to the sort of line of the president.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-1359673653-scaled-1-1024x573.jpg,,,2025-10-13 15:57:24.266942

The bill, HB 147, would require teachers to, “before entering upon the duties of a classroom teacher,” take the oath.
The language is similar to oaths taken by lawyers, doctors, and public officials.
Fabricio, R-Miami Lakes, is an attorney and has been in office since 2020.



Proposed oath
“I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support, protect, and defend the Constitution and Government of the United States and the Constitution and Government of the State of Florida; that I am duly qualified for employment as a classroom teacher in this state; that I will well and faithfully perform the duties of a classroom teacher in a professional, independent, objective, and nonpartisan manner; that I will uphold the highest standards of academic integrity and professional ethics; that I will foster a respectful learning environment for all students, which promotes critical thinking, civic responsibility, and lifelong learning; and that I will serve as a positive role model in both conduct and character, so help me God.”			


Education Commissioner Anastasios Kamoutsas sent a letter last month to superintendents after conservative activist Charlie Kirk was assassinated. That letter targeted teachers’ social media conduct that he deemed “despicable” and “vile, sanctionable behavior.”

The Legislature and governor in the past few years have also passed laws making illegal teaching about “divisive concepts” and “identity politics.”
Fabricio does not sit on any education committees. He is vice chair of the Ways & Means Committee and sits on the Judiciary Committee, Rules & Ethics Committee, Information Technology Budget & Policy Subcommittee, Natural Resources & Disasters Subcommittee, and the Transportation & Economic Development Budget Subcommittee.
Chapter 876 of Florida statutes require state employees, including those serving on school boards and working for state or county school districts, to take an oath that they are a citizen of Florida and to support the U.S. and Florida constitutions.
Other states require oaths to federal and state constitutions, including California, Georgia, and New York. According to Encyclopedia.com, almost two-thirds of states since 1863 have adopted teacher loyalty oaths.

The search committee will now meet Oct. 23 to  determine which candidates will be invited to formally apply for the president’s job. Members will meet again Oct. 29 to publicly interview the candidates and select three finalists. 
Those finalists will then meet with various university interest groups, such as faculty and students. Typically, some of these meetings are also public. 
Next, the Board of Supervisors will hold a special meeting to vote on hiring a president. LSU Board Chairman Scott Ballard did not immediately share when that meeting will be.

Mike Kehoe denied clemency Monday to Lance Shockley, a man sentenced to be executed at 6 p.m. Tuesday, citing Shockley’s unanimous conviction by jury for the 2005 murder of Missouri State Highway Patrol Sgt. Carl DeWayne Graham Jr.
But according to Shockley’s attorneys, the execution may be delayed by a motion filed last week in the U.S. Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals challenging the Missouri Department of Corrections’ refusal to allow his daughter, who is an ordained minister, to accompany him as his spiritual advisor in the execution chamber.
While Kehoe in a press release Monday described his denial of clemency as evidence of Missouri’s “commitment to the pursuit of justice,” Shockley’s advocates have argued he should not be executed because he was sentenced to death by a judge after the jury could not reach agreement on the death penalty. 
Missouri is one of only two states, along with Indiana, that allow judges to unilaterally choose the death penalty when a jury is split on how to sentence a defendant for a capital offense. In most other states, a deadlocked jury results in a life sentence. 
“[Kehoe] didn’t talk at all about the fact that the same jury that convicted him didn’t say he should die,” said Jeremy Weis, Shockley’s lead attorney and an assistant federal public defender. “I find that troubling and disappointing.”
Graham was found shot dead in the driveway of his home in Carter County in March 2005. He had been investigating Shockley’s role in a fatal 2004 drunk driving accident, which the prosecution said gave Shockley a motive for murder.
Kehoe noted in the press release that the Missouri Supreme Court, a federal district court, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals and the U.S. Supreme Court all reviewed Shockley’s case and let the trial court’s decision stand.
“Mr. Shockley has received every legal protection afforded to him under the Missouri and United States Constitutions,” Kehoe said, “and his sentence will remain for his brutal and deliberate crime.” 
Weis said Thursday that Shockley’s legal team had found after the trial that at least two of the 12 jurors who convicted Shockley voted for him to serve life in prison.
The motion to delay Shockley’s execution centers on a policy of the Department of Corrections allowing defendants the presence of a chosen spiritual advisor as they are put to death. The department denied Shockley’s request that his daughter fill this role, citing a policy prohibiting contact visits with family members once an execution has been scheduled.
“They just don’t want to follow their policy,” Weis said.
Weis said he expects a ruling Monday on the motion to delay Shockley’s execution.

U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Holly) called a new policy enacted by President Donald Trump “unprecedented” and “straight out of an authoritarian playbook, where the President gets to play judge, jury and executioner” in a speech on the Senate floor on Oct. 8. 
The policy, known as National Security Presidential Memorandum 7, was published by the White House on Sept. 25 and gives the president and the Attorney General broad authority to investigate any person or group that they consider to be involved in domestic terrorism or political violence. 
“As a nation, I think we should have as a basic principle that you can’t have a secret list of terrorist organizations that the American public and certainly the U.S. Congress don’t get to even know the names of,” Slotkin said. 
The memorandum says that any group advocating for a wide range of political views, which the statement lumps as “anti-fascist,” could fall into this category and thus be deemed terrorist organizations. Specifically, he includes any groups that demonstrate “anti-Americanism, anti-capitalism, and anti-Christianity; support for the overthrow of the United States Government; extremism on migration, race, and gender; and hostility towards those who hold traditional American views on family, religion, and morality.” 
Slotkin’s comments came during debate on a war powers resolution from Democratic Sens. Tim Kaine of Virginia and Adam Schiff of California that sought to limit the president’s power to authorize military action, following four strikes on boats in the Caribbean. The resolution failed 48-51. 
According to Slotkin, a letter from the Trump administration said that the United States is in “a non-international armed conflict” against “designated terrorist organizations,” she said in her speech. After asking for a list of those organizations from the Department of Defense, Slotkin added, she was told that no such list could be provided. 
“If this administration is not telling us who’s on their secret designated terrorist list for groups in the Caribbean, they’re definitely not going to tell us who’s on their list of domestic terrorist organizations,” she continued. 
A request for comment was sent to the White House, but has yet to be returned.
Slotkin, a CIA officer and former Pentagon official, noted the differences between this practice and how in the past new terrorist groups would be designated — by notification to Congress. 
“But that is not what’s going on today,” she said. “We will not understand the apparently dozens of terrorist organizations that we have now named until we understand their names.”
As written in the White House memo, recommendations of which groups to designate as domestic terrorists can come from the Attorney General. “The Attorney General shall submit a list of any such groups or entities to the President through the Assistant to the President and Homeland Security Advisor,” it continues, leaving Congress out of that chain of communication entirely.

(Photo by New Jersey Monitor)[2025 governor's race Voter Guide: The race for NJ governor]New Jerseyans looking to pick the state’s next governor have until Tuesday to register in time to vote in this year’s gubernatorial race.
State residents who are U.S. Citizens can register to vote if they are not incarcerated and have lived in their county for at least 30 days preceding Election Day. They must be at least 17 to register, though only those who turn 18 before Nov. 4 are eligible to vote.
Would-be voters can register online or by returning registration applications in person to their county’s superintendent of elections or commissioner of registration, depending on the county. Those offices, like local clerks and some state agencies, can provide voter registration forms.
Those forms can also be obtained online, and officials will accept voter registration applications returned by mail as long as they are postmarked no later than Oct. 14. New Jersey requires voters to be registered 21 days before an election to vote in that race.
Besides the governor’s race — Jack Ciattarelli (R) and Mikie Sherrill (D) are the front-runners to succeed term-limited Gov. Phil Murphy (D) — all 80 Assembly seats will be on the ballot this year.
The election is Nov. 4. Early in-person voting begins Saturday, Oct. 25. Mail-in ballots are being accepted now.
Repeat matchup in South Jersey Assembly race could be a nail-biter

Though Democrats maintain a massive voter registration lead, that lead has narrowed since the state’s last gubernatorial contest.
In 2021, there were a little less than 2.6 million registered Democrats and just over 1.5 million registered Republicans on Election Day.
By the start of this month, Democrats’ registration edge had narrowed to 855,049, according to state voter registration data. Republican gains and Democratic losses both drove the changes.
The GOP gained 163,847 registered voters since Election Day 2021, while Democrats lost 51,396.
The number of unaffiliated voters — what New Jersey calls independents — also declined over that time, falling by 70,369 to more than 2.3 million.
New Jersey has gained 33,991 voters since the last gubernatorial election. Just over 6.6 million residents are registered to cast ballots in the state.

(Photo by Carmen Forman/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – A recent state law meant to provide some abuse victims sentencing relief in criminal cases may need tweaking, two of the measure’s authors said.
Former House Majority Leader Jon Echols, R-Oklahoma City, and Rep. Andy Fugate, D-Del City, said a recent Oklahoma Supreme Court ruling highlights potential loopholes in the Oklahoma Survivors’ Act in its utilization by inmates and interpretation by judges.   
The law allows judges to give criminal defendants who are domestic violence victims lighter sentences if they can prove prior abuse contributed to the crime.
A 41-year-old offender appealed for relief under the law, alleging that he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and mental health issues from time spent in group homes and foster care as a child, according to court records. He alleged there was a connection between his PTSD and the crimes.
The man said his 20-year concurrent sentences were excessive, according to court records.
The man is serving time at Northeastern Oklahoma Community Corrections Center in Vinita for escaping from a penal institution and unauthorized use of a motor vehicle.
A Grant County district judge found the man might qualify for relief under the law created by Senate Bill 1835, which took effect in August 2024. He ordered the Oklahoma Indigent Defense System to represent the offender in his quest for a sentence reduction.
Jamie Pybas, Oklahoma Indigent Defense System executive director, appealed the order, arguing that state law prohibits their attorneys from being appointed to represent individuals appealing non-death penalty cases.
The state’s high court agreed, finding that while the Oklahoma Survivors’ Act allows judges to appoint an attorney to represent those seeking relief under the act, it does not specifically require representation through the Oklahoma Indigent Defense System.
The Oklahoma Supreme Court also found that the district court judge lacked the authority to appoint the indigent defense system to represent the man. 
“If the Legislature desires OIDS to provide representation in such cases, the Legislature may amend the Indigent Defense Act to include the Survivors’ Act proceedings within OIDS’s scope of representation,” the order said.
Echols, one of the bill’s authors, said the man’s request for sentencing relief was an “absurd” abuse of the act. He said it was offensive to real survivors of domestic violence.

“There are real victims that need this,” Echols said.
Echols said there must be a nexus between the crime and the abuse, and the law was meant to apply in situations where an abuse victim was defending themselves or when a victim of human trafficking stole a vehicle to escape.
“Rarely do we pass something on the first attempt that covers all of the bases,” said Fugate, another of the measure’s authors.
Fugate said as lawmakers discover loopholes in their legislation, they often go back and fix them.
“It sounds like we may need to do some tweaking,” Fugate said.

Gov. Kevin Stitt vetoed the original bill, Senate Bill 1470. The Senate overrode the veto.
But lawmakers ultimately decided to send Stitt a revised bill, which he signed.
Prosecutors said they were concerned about loopholes and potential for abuse by criminal defendants.
Although sold as a shield to protect victims, Stitt wrote in his veto message that the bill would create a sword by which criminal defendants will fight the imposition of justice.
Tulsa County District Attorney Steve Kunzweiler said he is in favor of the new law as it was written, but has concerns it could be subject to abuse.
“This guy’s ability to get this far in the process is pretty shocking,” he said of the 41-year-old inmate.
A recent Tulsa County case in which sentencing relief was denied cost his office $11,000 for an expert witness, Kunzweiler said. He said the law created an unfunded mandate for his office.
He said the law could be cleaned up to make it more clear.
Kyle Cabelka, district attorney for Comanche and Cotton counties and chair of the Oklahoma District Attorneys Council, said although lawmakers made positive changes to the law, it is still overly broad.
“I think that the language could be changed in a way that would at least give everybody more guidance,” he said.

(Courtesy Montana FWP)Investigations into two separate poaching cases by Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks have led to recent charges against four men, the department said in a series of press releases last week.
A special prosecutor filed charges against three Big Horn County men in Montana’s 22nd Judicial District Court alleging the unlawful killing of several bull elk and one mule deer near Hardin between 2022 and 2023.
Fish, Wildlife and Parks officials began investigating the case after receiving reports about a headless elk carcass in an area that no one had permission to hunt. Wardens with the department found that the group of individuals had allegedly killed and possessed several bull elk in Hunting District 702 during a closed season and without landowner permission. A mule deer buck was also killed without hunting licenses or landowner permission, according to the department’s press release.
Montana wardens executed multiple search warrants and seized several mounts of allegedly illegally killed deer and elk.
The three individuals are charged with 33 total charges, including 10 felony charges and 23 misdemeanor charges.

The investigation was in partnership with Montana Fish Wildlife & Parks, the U.S.  Fish & Wildlife Service, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs.

Fish, Wildlife and Parks also announced last week that a North Dakota man has also been charged in Fergus County District Court for a series of wildlife violations including allegedly killing two bull elk last November.
According to a press release, the man is accused of multiple misdemeanor and felony charges after Montana game wardens investigated reports he killed two bull elk in Hunting District 417 without proper permits. He allegedly hid and abandoned one elk carcass after being questions by wardens and was unable to retrieve another carcass after killing a bull elk on private land. He was also charged with driving off-road on state land.
The North Dakota man faces potential penalties including more than $60,000 in fines and restitution, jail time, and loss of privileges to hunt, fish and trap.
FWP officials say that most poaching cases are investigated following tips from the public. Anyone with possible information about crimes against fish, wildlife or state land resources is encouraged to visit tipmont.mt.gov or to contact a game warden in your area directly. Individuals may be eligible for a cash reward of up to $1,000.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/montana-fwp-1024x576.jpeg,,,2025-10-13 14:57:50.317769

On Saturday, Oct. 18, more than 100 communities from southeast Michigan to the westernmost part of the U.P. are set to hold “No Kings” rallies in support of civil rights, democracy and the rule of law.
During a Monday press conference, state representatives Laurie Pohutsky (D-Livonia) and Carrie Rheingans (D-Ann Arbor) joined with political organizers and members of advocacy groups to call out the Trump administration’s threats to immigration, free expression, political dissent and due process.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“Trump [Vice President J.D.Vance] and [White House Deputy Chief of Staff] Stephen Miller have been frank, the only legitimate Americans are those that agree with them and look like them, and the rest of us are terrorists, illegals, thugs,” said Shanay Watson-Whitaker, the director of Michigan campaigns at Reproductive Freedom For All. “It’s no accident that the only refugees currently allowed in the country are white South Africans. That’s what’s going on here, criminalizing the opposition, gutting our democracy and getting rid of people who get in the way.”
From the deployment of National Guard troops in several American cities, to the Trump Administration’s prosecution of the president’s political opponents, pressure and threats against celebrities and media outlets and the violent tactics deployed by U.S. Immigrations, Customs and Enforcement agents, speakers called out several instances of overreach since Trump took office in January. 
“Even if you have never feared deportation, even if you think this doesn’t touch your life, it will,” said Isa Azaria, an organizer and educator with We The People Dissent. “Authoritarianism always starts with those deemed ‘the other.’ Once those systems of surveillance, detention and militarization are normalized, they are turned on anyone who resists.” 
Christy McGillivray, executive director of the nonpartisan Voters Not Politicians, spoke out against the Trump administration’s effort to investigate groups opposed to his agenda, arguing the government is working to intimidate opponents and criminalize opposition. 
However, the best way to defend the right to free speech is by using it, McGillivray said. 
“This is what it means to be Americans. We are the ones living up to our Constitution’s ideals,” McGillivray said. “We are building a huge non-partisan tent. We welcome all free speech advocates and proud defenders of our Constitutionally protected civil rights to join us on the 18th and into the future. The Trump administration is lying to Americans about threats that are not real in order to hide the very real threat that they pose. We know better.”
Rheinegans closed the press conference with a call for citizens to let their voices be heard.
“The courts won’t save us. The media won’t save us. Corporate America won’t save us. That leaves us — the people. Through peaceful resistance and local organizing, we can restore our democracy. This is our moment to lead,” she said.
Communities where “No Kings” rallies will be held include Detroit, Lansing, Grand Rapids, Flint, Ann Arbor, Battle Creek, St. Ignace and Sault Ste. Marie.

 “Our hope is that others will see it and want to learn more about Aunt Fannie Lou, her life, her legacy and the tremendous sacrifices she made on behalf of others,” Hamer’s niece, Monica Land, said in a press release Monday.
Curators will decide where the medal is displayed, said Michael Morris, director of the two museums that are side-by-side in downtown Jackson.
“Our museums already trace much of her life’s work,” Morris said. “The medal symbolizes the impact her courageous activism has had on the lives of Black people in Mississippi and across the nation.”

Hamer was born Fannie Lou Townsend in 1917 to sharecroppers in Montgomery County, Mississippi. She joined the Civil Rights Movement in 1961 after attending a meeting with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. She became a SNCC organizer in 1962.
Hamer went on to become a key figure in Mississippi’s Civil Rights Movement. 
In 1964, Hamer helped organize Freedom Summer and co-founded the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party. The party traveled to the 1964 Democratic National Convention and tried to be recognized as an official delegation. She also addressed the Credentials Committee, speaking out about her experiences with racism and human rights abuses in Mississippi on national television.

The […]","A WEEK AGO, the CDC’s acting director signed off on the recommendations made by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), an external panel that sets US vaccine policy. The committee voted to recommend that COVID-19 vaccines, previously recommended as an annual shot for everyone over the age of 6 months, be taken only after discussion with a health care provider. They further emphasized the importance of a risk-based discussion of whether to get vaccinated for individuals under the age of 65.   
Six of 12 members also voted to require a prescription for vaccination, a motion that failed based on protocol, but which reflected the distrust of COVID-19 vaccines that committee members had been voicing throughout the day-long meeting.   
Professional societies and public health experts have, justifiably, reacted with disapproval both to the way the meeting unfolded and to the wording of the recommendations. The 2025-2026 CDC guidelines are, for the first time, at odds with those of the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, and the American Academy of Family Physicians.   
An alliance of Western states and a collaborative of Northeastern states each released their own guidelines just before the ACIP meeting, intentionally preempting CDC, the inevitable confusion from disparate recommendations a small price to pay compared to the chaos that they anticipated might occur if pharmacies and insurance companies stopped administering and covering, respectively, COVID-19 vaccines for large swaths of the population who want them.   
The Department of Health and Human Services, under the current administration, has repeatedly claimed that its more measured approach to vaccine recommendations is intended to restore public trust– in vaccines and in public health in general. This may or may not work, but one thing is certain: They are losing the trust of the scientific community. In the latest two rounds of ACIP meetings, presentations were made by non-experts, discussions lacked scientific rigor, and decisions were not always evidence based.  
But there’s an ironic story here that’s not being told: CDC and the ACIP under the previous administration were already planning to scale back COVID-19 vaccine recommendations.   
In April, the previous roster of ACIP members, who had served under President Biden, convened a meeting that had been postponed from February. The COVID-19 ACIP work group presented a summary of its offline discussions. Made up of ACIP members, government health agency officials, CDC employees, and liaisons from relevant professional societies, the work group introduced the rationale behind a new proposal to narrow vaccine recommendations from the current “universal” approach (in which all individuals over the age of 6 months are recommended to receive vaccines annually) to targeting high-risk individuals only.   
Arguments for a change to a risk-based approach included the continued decrease in the risk of COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths,  high rates of immunity, and the declining incidence of long COVID.   
They argued that the low rates of vaccination in the US indicate a lack of trust in recommendations around COVID-19 vaccination. And they presented a chart comparing US policy to that of other countries and the World Health Organization, highlighting the fact that the US is an outlier in its universal vaccination stance. In a survey of the group, 76 percent were in favor of a shift to risk-based vaccination recommendations.  
ACIP was to vote on this move away from universal vaccination in June. By then, though, all 17 members of the committee had been terminated. The COVID-19 vote was postponed to September, a decision which led to weeks of uncertainty due to the lag time between when the new formulation of the vaccine was approved by the FDA and the release of official guidelines for its use, all while Health and Human Services appeared to be issuing new vaccine policy via social media posts.  
Today, we have new vaccine recommendations from CDC, but they are accompanied by a growing rift between the agency and medical doctors, scientists, and public health authorities. Had the process been allowed to play out—with the original cadre of ACIP members voting in June—we might have guidelines today that are not so different from the new ones we just received, perhaps even more clearly outlining which populations are low risk.   
I agree that risk-based recommendations have the potential to increase public trust, but not without the backing of the scientific and public health community. Now, instead of trust, we have chaos.

,DC,2025-10-13 17:14:36+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Pentagon to shift research dollars to pay troops during shutdown,"Jennifer Shutt, Ariana Figueroa",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/pentagon-shift-research-dollars-pay-troops-during-shutdown,,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration plans to send paychecks to active duty troops this week, despite Congress not passing legislation to allow it during the ongoing shutdown.House Speaker Mike Johnson, who has refused to bring the House back into session to pass a stand-alone bill to provide pay for troops, welcomed the action during a Monday press conference, though he didn’t comment on whether the administration holds that legal authority.  “We are so very grateful that President Trump, again showing strong leadership, has stepped up to ensure that our troops are going to be paid on Oct. 15,” Johnson said. Congress approved a bill just before the 2013 government shutdown began, titled the Pay Our Military Act, that appropriated funding to ensure on-time paychecks for active duty and reserve troops during that funding lapse. A similar bill wasn’t necessary during the 2018-2019 shutdown since Congress had already approved the annual Defense Appropriations bill, one of the dozen full-year government spending bills that are supposed to become law by the start of the fiscal year on Oct. 1. Johnson and other Republicans have faced questions for weeks about whether the House would return to pass a similar bill, but he declined. The Louisiana Republican has said repeatedly that if Democrats wanted to ensure troops get paid during the funding lapse, they would pass the stopgap spending bill that remains stalled in the Senate. President Donald Trump announced this weekend on social media that in the absence of congressional action, his administration would provide paychecks for military members.“That is why I am using my authority, as Commander in Chief, to direct our Secretary of War, Pete Hegseth, to use all available funds to get our Troops PAID on October 15th,” Trump wrote. “We have identified funds to do this, and Secretary Hegseth will use them to PAY OUR TROOPS.”A Pentagon spokesperson said Monday the department “has identified approximately $8 billion of unobligated research development testing and evaluation funds (RDTE) from the prior fiscal year that will be used to issue mid-month paychecks to service members in the event the funding lapse continues past Oct. 15. “We will provide more information as it becomes available.“The White House did not immediately respond Monday to States Newsroom’s request for comment.Removes pressure pointTypically during a government shutdown, federal workers are categorized as exempt, meaning they keep working, or are furloughed. All are supposed to receive back fpay under a 2019 law that Trump signed, though he is now looking for ways to reinterpret it.Active duty military members are considered essential to federal operations and keep working during a shutdown, but a missed paycheck for troops has been viewed in the past as a pressure point on lawmakers to negotiate a deal.Trump’s actions have removed that incentive for Republicans and Democrats to broker some sort of agreement sooner rather than later. Johnson maintained during his press conference that Republican leaders will not negotiate with Democrats on their health care concerns until after the shutdown ends. Democratic leaders have said for months that lawmakers must reach an agreement to extend enhanced tax credits for people who buy their health insurance from the Affordable Care Act marketplace. The credits are set to expire at the end of the year.Democrats have blocked the House-passed stopgap spending bill, which would fund the federal government through Nov. 21, from advancing until there is a bipartisan agreement on the subsidies. Johnson said Democrats chose to sunset those tax credits at the end of this year because they were tied to helping people afford health insurance coverage during the coronavirus pandemic.Since then, he said, the enhanced tax credits have become “a boondoggle” that caused the cost of health insurance to rise faster than he believes it would have otherwise. “It’s a subsidy for insurance companies. When you subsidize the health care system and you pay insurance companies more, the prices are increased. That’s been the problem,” Johnson said. “So if indeed the subsidy is going to be continued, it needs real reform.” Health care overhaul?Johnson said lawmakers need October and part of November to determine how best to address the expiring tax credits, though he also appeared interested in overhauling other elements of the Affordable Care Act.“Can we completely repeal and replace Obamacare? Many of us are skeptical about that now because the roots are so deep. It was really sinister, in my view, the way it was created,” Johnson said. “I believe Obamacare was created to implode upon itself, to collapse upon itself.”Johnson, who was a freshman lawmaker in 2017 when Republicans tried to repeal and replace the ACA, said he still has post-traumatic stress disorder from the effort falling apart in the Senate amid opposition from the late Arizona Sen. John McCain, a Republican. “It was a great frustration of mine and it always has been of President Trump’s, and we know that American health care needs dramatic reform,” he said. “Let’s just state it simply: Obamacare failed the American people.” Johnson said any efforts to overhaul the 15-year-old law would take considerable time, but he didn’t preview any of that during his press conference. “You can’t just rip it out at the roots and start over,” Johnson said. “It’s a very, very complicated series of measures and steps you have to take to fix it.”",,,,2025-10-13 13:57:26.196884

Gavin Newsom approved mandatory monitoring and reminders when kids use chatbots. But a bill supported by child advocates was left unsigned.,"In summary
Gov. Gavin Newsom approved mandatory monitoring and reminders when kids use chatbots. But a bill supported by child advocates was left unsigned.


Gov. Newsom today announced that he has signed Senate Bill 243, legislation that adds guardrails to AI-powered chatbots that operate in the state.
The legislation had divided tech industry representatives and child safety advocates. Newsom left unsigned another bill regulating such bots, Assembly Bill 1064, which child advocates argued better protected kids. 
Under SB 243, companies that offer chatbots, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, would be required to institute specific safeguards. Among those would be requirements to monitor chats for signs of suicidal ideation, and to take steps to prevent users from harming themselves, such as by referring them to outside mental health assistance.
Makers of the chatbots would also be required to remind users that responses are artificially generated, and to create “reasonable measures” to prevent children from seeing sexually explicit content when using the bots. Kids using the bots would also get reminders to take breaks. 
The legislation, among the first in the nation regulating chatbots, comes after a series of disturbing reports. Stories around the country have highlighted how the chatbots can seemingly feed delusions, or fail to pick up on signs of suicidal ideation. Meta, Facebook’s parent company, faced backlash this year after a leaked copy of its chatbot rules revealed the company allowed its bots to have “sensual” conversations with children.
SB 243 received support from a changing mix of backers, with tech industry group the Computer and Communications Industry Association ending up supporting it. After initially opposing the legislation, the group said after changes that it would “provide a safer environment for children, while also not creating an overbroad ban on AI products.”
But child safety advocates, after initially supporting SB 243, soured on the legislation after those changes, saying they had conceded too much to the tech industry. Two groups, Tech Oversight and Common Sense Media, instead threw their support behind AB 1064, saying the bill “establishes critical regulations for the development and use of artificial intelligence systems that interact with children.”
Under AB 1064, chatbots would not be allowed without tech companies showing they are “not foreseeably capable” of harming a child, such as by encouraging self-harm.
“We’ve seen some truly horrific and tragic examples of young people harmed by unregulated tech, and we won’t stand by while companies continue without necessary limits and accountability,” Newsom said in a statement announcing his signing of SB 243.
The statement did not mention any action on AB 1064. The governor has until the end of the day to veto or sign the bill, although it going unmentioned suggested his office was unlikely to move forward with that legislation.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/090222-Computer-School-MG-CM-34.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-13 13:57:26.196884

(Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Kansas budget director objects to claims by House Speaker Dan Hawkins the state government budget adopted by the 2025 Legislature spent less than the amount proposed by Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly.
Adam Proffitt, who also serves as Kelly’s secretary of the Kansas Department of Administration, challenged the narrative repeatedly shared by Hawkins that the Legislature succeeded in trimming expenditures to a level $30 million below the governor’s budget recommendation.
Hawkins, who is campaigning to be elected state insurance commissioner, mocked Kelly’s decision to host eight public forums devoted to budget issues by asserting the GOP-led Legislature’s version of the budget was leaner and more businesslike. In a statement, Hawkins said the budget for the current fiscal year was evidence of thriftiness among Republicans in the House and Senate and wastefulness by the Kelly administration.
“The Legislature took the bull by the horns, implementing a new budget process that cut spending,” Hawkins said. “A reduction of over $30 million from the governor’s own proposal.”
Proffitt said Hawkins’ interpretation of the bottom line was inaccurate and incomplete. He said the final budget approved in April documented expenditures that were $23 million below what Kelly sought in January — not $30 million. In addition, Proffitt said Hawkins failed to take into account commitments by the Legislature that didn’t have funding attached, which artificially lowered projected expenditures through the fiscal year.
The budget director said the House speaker didn’t acknowledge the $13 million annual cost of complying with the Legislature’s pledge to expand services to disabled Kansans.
In addition, Hawkins didn’t reckon with interest payments of $16 million to $18 million annually on $215 million in bond debt the Legislature authorized in the 2025 session.
Proffitt said the state budget crafted by Republicans in the Legislature wasn’t more economical than what the governor outlined at start of the session.
“It now becomes pretty clear that its actually more expensive, not just in a first year, but when we have debt service for another 20 years, it’s more expensive in the out years as well,” Proffitt said.

‘Gimmicks, tricks’
Kelly, in Salina last week for the first of eight town halls on the state government budget, said her two terms as governor had been devoted to reversing budget mistakes made by Gov. Sam Brownback and the Kansas Legislature in the years before she took office in 2019.
She said that she forwarded to the 2025 Legislature a budget that was balanced, targeted spending on priorities of education and health, effectively used one-time expenditures rather than add debt for capital projects and would be sustainable in the future because it wouldn’t dramatically erode the state’s cash reserve.
“Unfortunately, this past session, the Legislature passed a budget that threatens the progress to prosperity that we’ve made,” Kelly said. “I know the budget that was put together last year by the Legislature is not sustainable over time. We’re back on the road to gimmicks and tricks, funny math.”
She said the Legislature’s approach to the budget would spend $300 million to $700 million more annually than the state collected in revenue. She said that at the current pace the state’s $3 billion surplus would be eaten away in three fiscal years.
“That is a huge concern to me, even though I won’t be governor then,” said Kelly, who leaves office in January 2027.
 
‘Gaslighting’
Hawkins said the governor didn’t have a grasp on the state’s revenue stream and anticipated expenditures. In September, the House speaker made that point after reports showed state tax revenue exceeded estimates by $47 million in the first two months of the fiscal year starting July 1.
He said the governor’s statements claiming Republicans had set the stage for crashing the budget were flawed.
“Another month, another gaslighting press release from the governor,” Hawkins said. “While the governor tries to point the finger at the Legislature, the reality is this: Real spending reform didn’t happen until lawmakers took the lead on the budget this year.”
He was referring to a decision by House and Senate leadership to appoint a special legislative committee that met in fall 2024 to craft an alternative budget to what Kelly proposed in January of this year. The Legislature, with Republican supermajorities in both chambers, generally ignored the governor’s recommendations.
Proffitt, the state budget director, said it was a mistake for the Legislature to reject the Kansas tradition in which governors set the starting point for budget debate during the annual session.
“I would say it was a highly inefficient process this past year and not one that I would recommend repeating,” he said. “It’s important for any governor to have input on the budget process and the way that it worked last year, and the way it’s being proposed to work next year, that’s not going to happen.”
Hawkins promised that work of the 2026 Legislature would resemble the results achieved in the 2025 session.
“When the Legislature returns in January, we’ll continue to hold the line, take a hard look at government spending and make sure your tax dollars are used effectively,” he said.
Hawkins encouraged Kelly, in her final full year as governor, to join Republicans in the effort to control state expenditures.
“I won’t be holding my breath,” he said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Proffitt-Kelly-1-1-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-10-13 13:57:26.196884

Forever War, Part 1: This story is published in partnership with The Assembly and with WHQR, a nonprofit radio station and NPR affiliate in Wilmington. It is the first in a series of stories about the PFAS crisis in North Carolina. 
OAK ISLAND, N.C.—Emily Donovan stood before 100 people in the pews at Ocean View United Methodist Church in a small seaside town in Brunswick County, North Carolina. It was May, the start of beach season. She had invited a scientist to speak about the astronomical levels of PFAS—nicknamed “forever chemicals”—that had been detected in sea foam four miles away.
But before she began her presentation, Donovan, a co-founder of Clean Cape Fear, had to deliver some bad news. That morning, Lee Zeldin, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency administrator appointed by President Donald Trump, had announced his intention to rescind drinking water regulations for several types of PFAS compounds.

The rollbacks included GenX, one of dozens that have contaminated the region’s drinking water and have been linked to disorders of the liver, kidneys and the immune system, as well as low birth weight and cancer.
Donovan felt devastated and enraged.
“Churches in Brunswick County baptize their babies in PFAS-contaminated tap water,” Donovan told the crowd. “We fought so hard. And now our hard work is getting rolled back.”
In 2013, scientists first discovered several types of PFAS in the Lower Cape Fear River, the drinking water source for several utilities in the region. The insidious chemicals were eluding traditional water treatment systems and flowing through the taps of hundreds of thousands of people.
The scientists traced many of the compounds to Chemours’ Fayetteville Works plant, 80 miles upstream. State and federal documents show that for 40 years Chemours and its predecessor, DuPont had been quietly tainting the drinking water of a half-million North Carolinians with high levels of toxic PFAS.
It took several years for that information to reach the public, but once it did, Donovan and her fellow environmental activists, as well as public interest lawyers, state legislators and local residents, started urging the EPA and the N.C. Department of Environmental Quality  to regulate the compounds.


Many went to Congress and to court. Clean Cape Fear pleaded its case to  the United Nations special rapporteurs on human rights, who concluded last year that PFAS contamination coming from the Chemours facility constituted “a business-related human rights abuse.”


Meanwhile, the scope of the contamination expanded throughout the state. Scientists found the compounds in fresh vegetables and fish, eggs and beer. Pine needles, honey and house dust. Landfills, compost and sewage sludge.
Blood of horses. Blood of dogs. Their own blood.
Finally, the environmental advocates prevailed. In 2024, Michael Regan, North Carolina’s former top environmental regulator who’d become President Joe Biden’s EPA administrator, announced his agency would regulate five types of PFAS, including GenX, in drinking water.
The celebration was brief.
Now, here was Trump back in the White House, and Zeldin, with support from the chemical industry, was dismantling those hard-won protections.
And now, here were North Carolinians, prepared to battle anew for the health of their communities. To stop Chemours from dumping GenX in landfills. To force the company to pay for drinking water it had defiled. To halt the expansion of the Fayetteville Works plant.
“This is a motivator, not a deflator,” Donovan said, a few weeks after Zeldin’s announcement. “We’re going to continue to fight this, now, more than ever.”
2013-2016: A Movement Is Born
The Cape Fear River begins 200 miles upstream from Wilmington, at the confluence of the Haw and the Deep rivers.
On its journey to the Atlantic Ocean, the Cape Fear rambles through forests of loblolly pine and courses under plains of concrete. About halfway to the sea, where the river grazes Chemours’ Fayetteville Works plant, the company was sending PFAS into the waterway.

Had it not been for Detlef Knappe and several scientists, including Mark Strynar and Andy Lindstrom of the EPA, Chemours could still be doing so.
Knappe is a distinguished professor of civil, construction and environmental engineering at NC State University in Raleigh. He grew up in southern Germany in the small town of Freudenstadt, which translates to “City of Joy.”
Now a lean, ruddy man in his 50s, Knappe has retained shards of his German accent, but its edges have been softened, like rocks weathered by water. He is quiet and modest, and never boasts that he was among the scientists whose findings launched an environmental movement.
In 2013, Knappe and the EPA scientists were curious about a new chemical that DuPont had been manufacturing at Fayetteville Works. It was a replacement for PFOA, another “forever chemical” used in stain-resistant carpet, waterproof apparel and nonstick cookware, which the company agreed to phase out by 2015 due to its health risks.
Coincidentally, the EPA scientists soon stumbled across a pamphlet from DuPont that named the mystery chemical: GenX.
Knappe had preserved water samples from the Cape Fear River for a different project. When the scientists analyzed the samples for GenX, they found average levels in Wilmington at 600 parts per trillion, with spikes reaching 4,500 ppt.
“We all felt that was really high,” Knappe said. “But how do you communicate that information? There’s this mystery chemical, GenX, and we weren’t aware of much information about its toxicity.”
The scientists were right: The levels were as much as 450 times what later became the drinking water standard. Their analysis found GenX was passing through the treatment system at the Sweeney Water Treatment Plant in Wilmington. Residents were drinking, bathing and playing in contaminated water.
As the scientists worked on a paper that contained their new findings, the EPA lowered the health advisory for PFOA and another forever chemical, PFOS, to 70 ppt. While the advisory didn’t apply to GenX, the scientists were concerned about the potential health effects of the new compound, given its high levels in the drinking water.
We have to publish that paper now, Knappe thought.
When the paper came out in November 2016, he shared the findings with state regulators and utilities, but without toxicity data, no one knew what to make of it.
Then a freelance reporter for the Star-News of Wilmington, Vaughn Hagerty, happened upon the scientific paper online. On June 6, 2017, he broke the story of the scientists’ findings about GenX in the city’s drinking water.
People protested in the streets. Residents mobilized on Facebook.
“What was surprising and gratifying was the impact that article made,” Knappe said. “And how, maybe for a moment, politics stopped.”
2017-2018: Clean Cape Fear 
Donovan is in her 40s, with chin-length, dark brown hair and glasses. At 5 foot 10, she is swan-like and often towers over a crowd. She worked in corporate marketing for a decade, then moved to Leland, in Brunswick County, from Charlotte with her husband in 2009. At the time, she was pregnant with twins, a boy and girl.
She became a stay-at-home mom and for seven years taught Bible study at Little Chapel on the Boardwalk in Wrightsville Beach. After noticing some children were praying for the health of their loved ones, Donovan said she heard God call her to become an environmental advocate.
In June, she and several concerned residents, including Cape Fear Riverkeeper Kemp Burdette, social activist and retired obstetrician Dr. Jessica Cannon, and former Wilmington Mayor Harper Peterson, gathered at Peterson’s wooden dining room table to discuss how to handle the crisis.
The demonstrations had been powerful, but diffuse. The activists decided they had to channel the public’s anxiety into a coherent movement. They called the group Clean Cape Fear.
In Raleigh, Michael Regan had been the head of the N.C. Department of Environmental Quality for just six months. He was homegrown, having been raised in Goldsboro, about an hour southeast of the capital. He graduated from the historically Black N.C. A&T University in Greensboro before heading to Washington, D.C., for an advanced degree in public administration.
Water pollution and obscure contaminants weren’t Regan’s specialty. He had worked in air quality and clean energy programs at the EPA and later at the Environmental Defense Fund.
Now as head of DEQ, Regan was facing the type of daunting challenge that can define a leader’s legacy.
2017-2018: Stymied at the Legislature
Republican State Rep. Ted Davis Jr., is 75, a trim man with wire-rimmed glasses. A former state and federal prosecutor, he grew up in New Hanover County and drank  water from the Cape Fear River for most of his life.
Like most people, Davis knew nothing about PFAS. But as an advisory member of the Joint Environmental Review Commission, he hoped his colleagues would support funding for local governments to address pollutants, monitor the river’s quality and hold hearings on the PFAS contamination.
Yet after a contentious Environmental Review Commission meeting in 2017, the Senate declined to hold another hearing.
Undeterred, Davis approached Republican Tim Moore, then the House speaker, and asked to form a special committee. “I said, ‘Tim, I don’t give a damn whether the Senate is going to support it or not,’” Davis recalled. “‘This is too important.’”
Davis, the senior chairman of the resulting House Select Committee on North Carolina River Quality, presided over seven lengthy meetings with toxicologists, state regulators, scientists and other experts.
Still, several legislators fell in line with the industry’s talking points. State Rep. William Brisson, a former Democrat from Bladen County who had switched parties, downplayed the compounds’ toxicity. “It’s not like the mice fell over dead when they were injected with GenX,” he said at the committee hearing.
Those hearings prompted Davis to introduce the Water Safety Act. But only one of the bill’s provisions became law: A $450,000 allocation to the Cape Fear Public Utility Authority to test the finished drinking water and to install a temporary advanced treatment system was eventually folded into the state budget.
“We all drink the water and we breathe the air, and some of us just don’t seem to care about cleaning it up.”
— State Rep. Deb Butler

On the Democratic side, state Rep. Deb Butler, an attorney who represents New Hanover County, was having even less luck than Davis in advancing PFAS legislation. Some of her bills called for an outright ban on PFAS, including their use in firefighting foam and consumer packaging. Most of the measures died in committee; some never got a hearing.
“One of the things I’ve learned in the last eight years is that things that shouldn’t be politicized are, and the environment is one of them,” Butler said earlier this summer. “We all drink the water and we breathe the air, and some of us just don’t seem to care about cleaning it up.”


2018: A Prayer Circle and Cancer
Brian Long, then the plant manager at Fayetteville Works, paced the floor before more than 100 people at Faith Tabernacle Christian Center. He wore an orange Chemours pin on the lapel of his sport jacket.
It was a cloudy evening in June 2018. The company was hosting a public event in St. Pauls, a small town two hours from Wilmington, to assuage the community’s fears about GenX.
“There’s been a lot reported on this compound,” Long told the frustrated, angry crowd. “We have decades of evidence and studies that suggest this compound—at the levels we see in our environment—do not cause health risks.”
EPA and academic scientists soon found that even at low levels, GenX was associated with harm to the thyroid, liver and kidneys.
Rates of thyroid cancer declined in New Hanover and Brunswick counties, according to National Cancer Institute data from 2017 to 2021, the most recent figures available. However, those two counties still rank second and fifth, respectively, for thyroid cancer rates in North Carolina, data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show.
Kidney cancer rates rose in Brunswick and Pender counties during that time, according to federal data. Pender County leads North Carolina in rates of testicular cancer, also associated with GenX exposure.
Local residents had begun reporting their experiences with cancer and other health problems. Some risk factors, such as age and genetics, make it difficult to establish causation between their illnesses and exposure to PFAS. Yet thyroid, testicular, brain and other cancers have been linked to the compounds.
Several advocates’ families were touched by disorders they felt might have been linked to          PFAS exposure. Donovan’s husband, David, had been diagnosed with a benign brain tumor that caused him to go blind until a surgeon removed it.
Dana Sargent, then with Cape Fear River Watch, was worried about her older brother, Grant Raymond, diagnosed nine months before with a malignant brain tumor. He had been exposed to high levels of PFAS while a U.S. Marine and throughout his career as a Chicago firefighter. Doctors had given him less than five years to live. He was only 45.
Sargent, now 51, is from the Chicago area and arrived in North Carolina by way of California and Washington, D.C. She is short and petite, with long, flowing brown hair. She specializes in research, but her other quality is bluntness.
She attended the meeting, which began with a prayer circle that included Chemours. “It was asinine and repulsive to hold a meeting in rural North Carolina, in a church—to help shut people up,” she said. “They knew what they were doing.”
One man in the second row told Long that because of contamination in his neighborhood, he couldn’t sell his house.
“I understand you’re frustrated,” Long said, three times.
The man became angry, and as law enforcement led him out of the church, he told Long, “You have defiled the house of God.”
2018-2019: Chemours Cuts a Deal 
Here’s Kemp Burdette, the Cape Fear Riverkeeper, on how to snag an alligator to test its blood for PFAS:
Get a treble hook, the kind used to catch a marlin. 
Cast the rod over the alligator, which should be lying in the water. Reel in the line until the hook reaches the alligator, then jerk it with all your strength.
Steer the tired alligator to the bank. 
Then, everyone jumps on the alligator (multiple humans, if possible).
Finally, tape the alligator’s mouth shut. Stick a 20-gauge needle at the base of its skull to draw 15 milliliters of blood.
Burdette helped NC State University and EPA scientists apprehend alligators in the Cape Fear River and several nearby lakes to test their blood for PFAS. Alligators spend their long lives in water often polluted with chemicals; they can serve as models for detecting human health problems caused by contamination.
The scientists sampled the blood of 75 alligators and found 14 different PFAS at concentrations similar to levels found in the blood of Wilmington residents. High levels of PFOS  would later be found in several species of freshwater fish, prompting the state health department to advise people to eat no more than seven servings a year. Pregnant women should eat none.
It had been more than a year since the contamination had become public, and Burdette was fed up with what he viewed as DEQ’s inertia and Chemours’ negligence. He pestered the attorneys at the Southern Environmental Law Center: We’ve got to do something.
Geoff Gisler, then a senior attorney at SELC, began to strategize, but it soon became apparent to him what needed to happen.
“We sued,” Burdette said.
SELC alleged DEQ was failing to uphold the North Carolina Constitution, a section of which obligates the agency to protect the environment and human health from the effects of pollution. The law center also filed suit against Chemours, alleging it had violated the federal Clean Water Act by discharging PFAS, including GenX, into the Cape Fear River.
By the fall of 2018, DEQ and Chemours were trying to make a deal.
“In some ways it was a very sterile process,” Burdette recalled. “But it was also very tense. I felt like we didn’t need to do a whole lot of negotiating because we were right. They had poisoned the drinking water supply, and the state had let them do it. I didn’t want to compromise, and I think we did as little of that as we possibly could.”
By February 2019, the parties had crafted a consent order. Among the many provisions in the 46-page document was a requirement for the company to sample private wells for a dozen types of PFAS and to provide clean water to households whose wells were contaminated above certain thresholds.
No longer could Chemours discharge wastewater into the river as part of its manufacturing processes. No longer could the company expel hundreds of tons of GenX from its smokestacks; it had to reduce the emissions by 99.9 percent.
DEQ, too, had specific duties to hold Chemours accountable, including levying a record $13 million civil penalty.
“I think it’s been a tremendous success,” Gisler said in a recent interview. “It was never the final word and would never fix all the problems, but it’s a big step in the right direction. It’s our view that the polluter has to pay, and that hasn’t been happening, because the state and the EPA had not been enforcing it.”
In retrospect, Sargent, the former head of Cape Fear River Watch, wishes the consent order had been tougher. But when the document was finalized, few, if anyone, could foresee the scientific advances in detection methods.
“We didn’t know then that there were 350 types of PFAS coming out of Chemours,” Sargent said. “There’s still people falling through the cracks.”
Some of those people lived in Brunswick County, where private drinking water wells and river water entering the Northwest treatment plant were contaminated. That plant served homes, businesses and schools, including the one Donovan’s young children attended.
“It sickens me to think I may have hurt my children by letting them drink that tap water,” Donovan testified before the U.S. House Oversight Subcommittee in 2019. She urged its members to pass a law banning the manufacture of the compounds. “I will forever wonder if one day that will cause them medical harm.”
At the hearing, she named her friends—Sarah, Tom, Kara—all young, all with rare or recurrent cancers.
“I am begging you to engage your humanity, to find the moral courage,” Donovan said. Her voice cracked. “To protect the most valuable economic resource—human life. Because it’s already too late for some of us.”
Some of Donovan’s friends have since died. “They left kids who are questioning their faith, wondering why God hates them so much that they gave their parents cancer and didn’t save them,” Donovan said. “The people who fought so hard to get answers of what caused their cancer died not knowing.”
Sargent’s brother, Grant, was among them. In December 2019, two years and three months after his diagnosis, his brain tumor killed him.
2021-2022: Quest for Accountability
One spring day, Donovan spotted odd-looking sea foam near the Ocean Crest Pier in Oak Island, a popular spot for saltwater fishing. She learned that the best time to find the foam is after a storm or on extremely windy days, when the water is agitated. She scanned live beach video feeds and local social media chats, where people posted photos of the foam blooms.
Her sightings, as it turned out, were not isolated to the coast. State officials had seen similar foam at 15 other spots, including in Falls Lake near Raleigh and a stream in the southern foothills of the Appalachian mountains.
Eventually Donovan collected samples from 13 sites in the Cape Fear River and along the coast, including near airports and military installations, which often use firefighting foam that contains the compounds. NC State scientists began an analysis, a process that took more than a year.
In Raleigh, Davis, the Republican representative from New Hanover County who had successfully negotiated for GenX funding, was still trying to pass legislation to hold Chemours accountable. He sponsored a new bill, “PFAS Pollution and Polluter Liability,” that would require that polluters who discharged PFAS into a public water system pay for treatment costs to remove the compounds.
“I’m going to fight for my constituency,” Davis said at a hearing of the House Judiciary Committee. “If the gentleman from Chemours really wants to show they care, why don’t they pay to make the water safe from the contamination they put in that river?”
The legislation was referred to the Agriculture and Environment Committee, but, like several PFAS-related bills before it, never received a hearing.
In the same legislative session, Butler, the New Hanover County attorney now in her second term as a representative, sponsored House Bill 444. It was more aggressive than Davis’ bill and extended liability to dischargers of the compounds, not only the manufacturers.
The bill had more than 20 co-sponsors, including a Republican, Frank Iler of Brunswick County. It never received a committee hearing.
2024: At the EPA, Regan Delivers
Michael Regan had overseen North Carolina’s PFAS crisis as DEQ secretary, but a hostile legislature and an indolent EPA under the first Trump administration hamstrung much of his effort to change policy. In 2021, Biden empowered him to take steps to protect the nation’s drinking water in his new role as EPA administrator.
Yet three years had passed since Regan had joined the EPA and environmental advocates had become impatient with what they viewed as the agency’s sluggish progress on regulating PFAS.

Then, on a warm morning in April, Regan returned to North Carolina, to Fayetteville, the Cape Fear River flowing behind him.
He had arrived to announce the first legally enforceable maximum concentration levels for PFOA and PFOS at 4 parts per trillion and for GenX, PFNA and PFHxS at 10 parts per trillion. Several of the compounds were also regulated as a mixture.
Although the standards applied to only five of the 15,000 types of PFAS, they were something.
“This is the most significant action on PFAS the EPA has ever taken,” Regan said. “The result is a comprehensive and life-changing rule, one that will improve the health and vitality of so many communities across our country.”
Donovan credited the progress to the EPA’s openness to meeting with environmental advocates.
“We had conversations and incredible access to the EPA. We were given the same level of stakeholder value as the industries, maybe even more,” Donovan said. “The Regan we saw at the EPA was much more muscular than at DEQ.”
Not everyone applauded the regulations. Some conservative members of North Carolina’s Environmental Management Commission, which approves or disapproves rules proposed by DEQ, blanched at Regan’s announcement.
Michael Ellison, who was appointed to the commission by Senate President Pro Temp Phil Berger, has a history of downplaying concerns about the compounds. At a meeting that summer, Ellison asked, rhetorically, “For decades we’ve been making and discharging this stuff. How many people have died from PFAS poisoning?”
Sargent was sitting in the room. Her eyes watered. She thought of her brother and the cruelty of Ellison’s remark.
“He had no empathy,” she recalled. “He thought this was a joke.“
The American Water Works Association, a national trade group of public utilities, opposed the standards for financial reasons. The Biden administration had earmarked $1 billion to help utilities in small or disadvantaged communities cover the costs of advanced treatment to remove the compounds, yet that was a fraction of the estimated $30 billion needed for all of the nation’s affected water systems.
In North Carolina, more than 1,900 public water systems would be required to comply with the new rules by 2029. If the maximum contaminant levels had been in effect on the day of Regan’s announcement, the drinking water of at least 300 systems would exceed them.
Two months later, the trade group sued the EPA, arguing the agency hadn’t followed the legally required procedures when it made the rules.
Regan felt assured the standards could withstand a legal challenge. What he wasn’t accounting for was that in seven months Donald Trump would win a second term and that Regan’s successor would begin to brazenly repeal the standards.
May 2025: The Persistent Republican
It was after 7 p.m. on May 7, and the North Carolina House of Representatives had been debating bills for five hours. Davis, wearing a gray suit with a white pocket square and a red tie, rose from Seat No. 9 in the House chamber.
“We’ve had a long day and we’re all tired,” Davis said. “But I hope you’ll give serious consideration to what I have to say.”
Davis was a primary sponsor of a bill titled “PFAS Pollution and Polluter Liability,” modeled after his previous legislation. It was just two pages. Although it didn’t mention Chemours by name, the language was so specific, it could mean no one else.
If a PFAS manufacturer contaminated a public utility’s drinking water above federally permissible levels, it would have to pay for the installation, maintenance and operation of a treatment system to reduce concentrations in finished drinking water to comply with those limits.
“You can make all the PFAS you want,” Davis told his colleagues, “but you can’t release it into the environment.”
A last-minute amendment—key to garnering enough votes for the bill to pass—narrowed the list of eligible public water systems to those that incurred costs of more than $50 million. Those were the systems in New Hanover, Brunswick and Cumberland counties, which, without the bill, would pass the costs on to ratepayers.
“These costs should be the responsibility of the polluter,” Davis said. “It’s only fair.”
Unlike Davis’ previous PFAS legislation, this bill crossed party lines to include many Republicans. It had more than 40 co-sponsors, including some of the most progressive Democrats in the House.
The members began to vote. On the digital screens mounted in the House chamber, names of those voting yes lit up in green. After 26 seconds, nearly the entire screen was green. The bill passed 104-3.
Davis was ecstatic. It had taken five years for him to carry a Polluter Pays bill this far.
“I was tickled to death,” Davis said later. “That guy from Chemours,” seated in the gallery, “I could see he had a sick look.”
With the House in the win column, Davis now had to convince the Senate to support his legislation.
May 2025: Sea Foam and an Industry Unrestrained
A few hours before Donovan’s sea foam presentation at Ocean View United Methodist Church, Lee Zeldin, Trump’s EPA administrator, dropped the hammer. He would rescind Regan’s maximum concentration levels for GenX and three other PFAS compounds.
The EPA announcement was even more troubling in light of the results of the long-awaited study on the PFAS-laden sea foam.
Jeffrey Enders, a research assistant professor at NC State University, detected 42 types of PFAS, including some manufactured only by Chemours. One type that Chemours used as a replacement for a phased-out compound, PFO5DoA, was detected at 20,000 parts per trillion. In a different study, scientists had previously found PFO5DoA in 99 percent of the 344 Wilmington residents who provided blood samples.
Levels of PFOS, which has not been produced in the U.S. since 2002, were found in the foam as high as 8 million ppt—the highest concentration ever reported in published scientific journals.
After Enders’ presentation, people told their personal stories.
“I live in Brunswick County and have been exposed my entire life,” one woman said, including while she was pregnant. Her drinking water well had a total PFAS level of 300 ppt.
“Now my kids are having issues,” she said, as she began to cry. “This hits hard.”
June 2025: The Senate Takes Up the Bill
Three weeks later, Davis’ bill was up for discussion in the Senate Environment Committee.
A few Republican members had warmed to regulating Chemours. “We need to run this bill,” said state Sen. Tom McInnis, a Republican whose district includes Cumberland County, another heavily contaminated area. “The folks at Chemours are notorious for not doing what’s right.”
Rep. Ted Davis Jr. (Photo: N.C. General Assembly)
Some Democrats thought the bill didn’t go far enough, although they agreed to support it. “You’re trying to hold the most culpable company responsible,” said Sen. Julie Mayfield of Buncombe County. “I just want people to understand this might not solve the problem.”
“I wish we could get rid of it all, but that would be herculean,” Davis said. “This is a baby step, but it might put a little bit of fear in anyone who might make PFAS.”
The tension in the room tightened. A parade of industry lobbyists began speaking to the committee, including from Chemours.
Jeff Fritz of Chemours said state regulators knew in the early 2000s that DuPont, which later spun part of its business off as Chemours, was making PFAS, including GenX. That is true. However, state records show that while regulators knew about the manufacturing, the companies failed to disclose in their discharge permits that they were sending PFAS into the Cape Fear River.
Fritz also claimed that Chemours voluntarily decided to stop discharging all PFAS. But he omitted the fact that the company did so only under scrutiny by state regulators. And that Chemours failed to stop all discharges until a second state inspection discovered GenX was still entering the river from the plant.
The bill didn’t advance. It’s eligible to be heard again next year.
September 2025: Zeldin Targets GenX for Rollback
In September, EPA Administrator Zeldin made good on his promise. The agency filed a motion in the U.S. Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia to vacate Regan’s maximum contamination levels for GenX and the three other PFAS compounds, siding with the American Water Works Association, a trade group that had opposed them.
“This is a flat-out victory for Chemours,” Donovan said. “They’re playing their game, and the Trump EPA is 100 percent caving to industry pressure.”
The argument hinges on what Zeldin alleges is an administrative misstep: When the EPA enacted the rule under Regan, it allegedly did so out of sequence.
The Safe Drinking Water Act requires the EPA to first publish a notice of intent to regulate a contaminant and seek public comment on whether it should, in fact, be regulated.
Only then can the agency propose a national primary drinking water standard and goal for the contaminant. That step requires another public comment period.
Zeldin alleges Regan’s EPA proposed and finalized a regulatory determination—as well as the regulation itself—“simultaneously and in tandem.” Without a second comment period, Zeldin argued, the agency “denied the public and the regulated community the opportunity to adequately comment on and participate in the rulemaking process.”
The EPA proposed the PFAS drinking water standards in March 2023 and provided a 60-day comment period. More than 120,000 comments were submitted, including by those now challenging the rule, according to the SELC, which also provided comments.
The agency then published a detailed 4,570-page response to those comments.
Zeldin’s EPA intends to issue a draft rule rescinding the regulations for public comment this fall; a final rule on the maximum contamination levels (MCLs) is expected next spring.
A Chemours spokesperson said the company supports the EPA’s decision. “Chemours wholly supports setting reasonable and scientifically justified MCLs,” the spokesperson said, “but getting the science right is absolutely critical, and the evidence clearly demonstrates that the previous determination for GenX is flawed.”
The EPA retained two independent scientific panels to review its findings. Over 135 pages, the 12 reviewers largely agreed with the conclusions, with minor suggestions; the agency incorporated many of them.
Chemours is cherry-picking the facts, trying to “confuse the narrative,” Donovan said.
The company cited six scientific studies conducted from 2018 to 2023 that concluded GenX’s toxic effects on rodent livers could not be extrapolated to humans because of a genetic difference in how a protein behaves between the two species.
However, four of those studies included a conflict of interest statement from the scientists, many of whom work for private consulting firms, indicating the research had been done on behalf of Chemours.
EPA scientists challenged those Chemours-backed findings. They cited examples of how the protein in question is relevant to both species; in humans, medicines are developed to target that very protein.
More than 40 concerned parties have either petitioned to intervene in the case or to file briefs in support of keeping the standards: Prominent scientists, like Linda Birnbaum, a toxicologist and former director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences; attorneys general from 17 states, including Jeff Jackson of North Carolina; and environmental groups, including Cape Fear River Watch and Clean Cape Fear.
It’s uncertain whether the rescission will survive a court challenge. Under the federal backsliding rule, the EPA can’t legally repeal the standards, said Jean Zhuang, senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center. The Safe Drinking Water Act stipulates that changes to the standards can only be more protective, not less.
“What Zeldin has announced is clearly in violation of the law, in addition to harming over 100 million Americans and their drinking water,” Zhuang said. “These industries, like Chemours, are fighting these drinking water standards because then the pressure is off them to control these chemicals.”
Regardless of what happens at the federal level, a DEQ spokesperson said the agency will continue to enforce the consent order. It is also gathering data from public water systems to help them meet the drinking water standards for PFOA and PFOS by the new deadline of 2031.
Accounting for private wells and public drinking water systems, DEQ estimates 3.5 million North Carolinians are exposed to levels of PFAS above federal standards.
The same day that Zeldin filed the motion in federal court about the GenX standards, DEQ announced it was requiring Chemours to offer private well testing to an additional 14,000 residents in New Hanover, Brunswick, Columbus and Pender counties.
This brings the total to more than 200,000 homes in 10 counties that are eligible for PFAS testing. Of those, state records show more than 22,000 have been sampled and nearly 7,500 have qualified for alternate water supplies as stipulated in the consent order.
Previous testing has found PFAS 400 feet deep, nearly to bedrock, and in wells as far as 28 miles from Fayetteville Works.
DEQ says it has not yet found the contamination’s edge.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-13 16:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"At Black Business Expo, Hartford businesses make sales—and build community",P.R. Lockhart,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/13/black-business-expo-hartford/,"The event aims to promote the growing Black business community, showing off the entrepreneurial spirit and the range of opportunities.","Thursday night’s cool weather did nothing to chill the enthusiasm of dozens of Black business owners and community members who came together for what’s become a semiannual event at Dunkin’ Park.
In a room filled with music, silver balloons and plenty of conversation, people traded multiple things — food, money, business tips and more — over the course of several hours as the local Black Business Expo came to life for the second time this year. 
Some 60 businesses took part in the “Black to the Future”-themed event, which aims to promote the region’s growing Black business community, showing off the entrepreneurial spirit of local businesses owners and the range of opportunities under development in Hartford. 
The event first started in 2023 as part of the Black History Month outreach programming for the foundation arm of the Hartford Yard Goats baseball team. But the expo quickly grew in popularity, leading to the addition of a second expo event each year. 
“When we first opened up the registration, we had about 80 to 85 vendors signed up,” said Aisha Petteway, the executive director of community partnerships for the Hartford Yard Goats Foundation, and a lead organizer of the expo. “From then on, we knew that this was an experience that our community needed.”
That the expo has grown so quickly, local business owners told the Connecticut Mirror, shows that it is meeting a growing need. The event has helped fill in the local business landscape, smoothing over gaps and hurdles that have historically made it harder for Black and Latino business owners to find stable footing in the area.
Research over the years has shown that these difficulties are compounded for business owners operating out of Hartford’s poorest neighborhoods: these businesses can have even more issues accessing capital and navigating the process of developing an idea and gaining exposure.
Community events like the expo, organizers say, provide these businesses with a chance to connect directly with consumers. But just as importantly, the event allows businesses to connect with each other, building a community and network that allows local Black business owners to support one another.
It’s a more community-oriented model of economic development, shifting away from a traditional focus on banks, loans and capital and onto community support, social networking and shared resources. And in close-knit communities like Hartford’s, it’s a model that local residents and business owners say is crucially needed.
“To us, it’s about more than commerce,” said Petteway. “It’s about connection, and also highlighting the services, the goods and the culture of Black-owned businesses.”
Hartford has struggled to support Black businesses in the past
Minority businesses owners have faced a challenging time in Hartford. A 2012 survey of business owners conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau, for example, found that the number of minority-owned businesses in the nation increased from 2007 to 2012, growing to make up 29% of all businesses by the end of the survey period. Over that same period in Hartford, the number of local minority-owned businesses made up just 20% of local businesses.  
The limited growth of minority businesses in the city has prompted additional research. One study in particular, a 2022 redevelopment study of Hartford’s Arrowhead Gateway area, a 41-acre predominantly Black community running parallel to Albany Avenue and Main Street just to the north of downtown Hartford and the I-84 corridor, offers helpful insights. 
The report’s authors noted that the neighborhood is one of the poorest in the city and has faced “significant disinvestment” as the result of the area being redlined and largely left behind after the construction of the I-84 corridor. The area then faced further neglect and decline as residents moved out and blight moved in during the 1960s and 1970s. 
But the block has still retained a strong cultural identity and sense of community. According to a small business assessment released as an appendix to the report, the Arrowhead area has become a hub for business activity as a number of Black and Latino entrepreneurs began to launch new businesses during the pandemic.

In the wake of this growth, additional support from the city could be a major help. 
“Technical assistance and financial support should be provided to support existing businesses in the area and create opportunities to grow new small, local, and Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC)-owned businesses,” the report authors noted.
These “technical assistance and financial supports” could include programs like microgrants, targeted programs aimed at supporting the growing number of local food and beverage businesses in the area, and the creation of an “entrepreneurial ecosystem,” a community-driven collective where entrepreneurs can support one another and collaborate on initiatives.
The city of Hartford is working to create some of these recommended programs, launching new initiatives in recent years. In 2023, the city launched a microgrant program aimed at supporting the city’s smallest businesses, defined as having five employees or fewer, with $2,500 grant awards. In 2025, the city announced the second year of the microgrant program in partnership with the Urban League of Greater Hartford, increasing the grant amounts to a maximum of $5,000.
And the Arrowhead Gateway area has been slated for a significant amount of development in the coming years, including new housing and commercial projects, as well as the first grocery store serving Hartford’s North End.
Other efforts are being driven by the community, building off of work started organically in Hartford during the pandemic. The Sto Marketplace, for example, started in 2021 as a space where Black entrepreneurs could sell goods and trade ideas, becoming a prominent business collective in the area.
One of its founders, Jennifer Wilder, says that the initiative has grown in the years since to include training and workshops and is now a partner in the Black Business Expo events held at Dunkin’ Park, one of the largest attractions anchoring the Arrowhead area. 
“We wanted to be able to fill in a gap for some of the business owners that we worked with,” Wilder said. “And it kind of just grew into this amazing experience.”
Building a business ‘family’
As she stood at the entrance of the business expo on Thursday night, Wilder noted that the event has become a transformative presence in Hartford, showcasing not only the power and influence of the region’s Black entrepreneurs but also the diversity of the types of businesses founded in Black communities. 
Wilder, a business owner herself, was there to promote both the Sto Marketplace and her work at the Big Red Book Truck, a mobile bookstore highlighting children’s books written by or starring people of color.  
A few steps to her left stood Wilder’s son, Courtenay Jackson, a clothing brand owner who was there to promote his apparel line, Eatin’. 
“There are so many cool stories here,” Wilder said of the businesses gathered for the event. “We’re such a family, so tight-knit, all growing and evolving. And as we do these events together, everyone is elevating their craft.”
That sentiment was present throughout the expo as real estate agents, cheesecake makers, candle companies, financial literacy advisors, and local artists sat at booths, speaking with customers, exchanging hugs and passing out business cards. A few women danced as Luther Vandross’s “Never Too Much” played over the speakers. 
In the middle of the room, Brittany Stokes, owner of Sophisti_Hippie Nails, stood next to her table watching people mill about, waiting for prospective buyers to approach to look at her nail art and press-on nail business. A sign in front of her stand read “Leaves are Falling, Nails are Calling.”
Stokes, a Hartford native, said that the business expo has been a valuable space for her as she continues to build her business, which was started during the pandemic. 
“The atmosphere is great, a lot of people here are people I know from around Hartford,” she said. “It’s about building relationships.”

A little further into the room, in a back area sectioned off for food vendors, business owners Lance McDougald, Gabriel Boyd, and Mike Johnson were also waiting to make their next sales. The business expo, they said, had become a powerful way for them to get their businesses started and help build a customer base.  
“It helps to meet the other vendors, the other Black and brown business owners and networking,”  said Boyd, who runs The 881 Grab and Go, a Caribbean fusion eatery on Hartford’s New Britain Avenue, with his wife. “It feels good to just be in the building with one another.” 
That spirit of connection and unity, of hustle and fellowship, is what Petteway says the event is all about.
“We want to build with these business owners,” she said. “It’s really a community.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ExpoWilderandJackson-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-13 12:58:10.076803

(Photo by Aristide Economopoulos/New Jersey Monitor) A Florida House Republican has again filed legislation that would reduce the minimum to buy a firearm in the state from 21 to 18 years of age.
The proposal (HB 133), sponsored by Rep. Tyler Sirois, a Brevard County Republican, has passed in the Florida House during the past three legislative sessions, but failed to advance in the Florida Senate. The existing law exempts law enforcement officers, correctional officers, or service members younger than 21.
The Florida Legislature and then-Gov. Rick Scott raised the age for purchasing a firearm in 2018 as part of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Public High School Safety Act, just weeks after the school shootings in Parkland that killed 17 people.
The effort to restore the legal age for purchasing a firearm to 18 has been supported by Gov. Ron DeSantis and gained momentum this spring when Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier announced that he would not defend the law after a federal appeals court again upheld its constitutionality after it was challenged in federal court by the NRA.
“If the NRA decides to seek further review at SCOTUS, I am directing my office not to defend this law,” Uthmeier said in March, not long after DeSantis appointed him to his office. “Men and women old enough to fight and die for our country should be able to purchase firearms to defend themselves and their families.”
The NRA has subsequently asked the U.S. Supreme Court to hear its challenge to Florida’s law.
Meanwhile, another federal appeals court — the Fifth Circuit — ruled in January that the federal law banning federal firearms licensees from selling handguns to individuals aged 18 to 20 is unconstitutional under the Second Amendment.
Rejected in Florida Senate
Again, the state Senate has consistently thwarted repeal — in 2023 and 2024 by then-President Kathleen Passidomo and earlier this year by sitting Senate President Ben Albritton.
Second Amendment groups have been critical of those efforts, and they are speaking out now with concerns about what Albritton might do when it comes to an implementing bill that would make the open carrying of firearms legal in Florida statute.
The state’s First District Court of Appeals ruled last month that the 1987 law banning open carry in Florida was unconstitutional, and Uthmeier declared five days later that, in light of that ruling, he was declaring that open carry is now the law of the state.
However, speaking during a press conference at the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office two weeks later, Uthmeier acknowledged that changing the law based on the court’s ruling was “not the cleanest situation and there’s likely cleanup that’s going to be needed by the Legislature.”
In Tallahassee this week, Albritton told reporters “there are some questions” about the new policy, and that he was seeking advice from Florida sheriffs, whose political organization, the Florida Sheriffs Association, historically had opposed open carry.
‘Questions’ about open carry
“There are some questions about the Capitol, specifically, about how well guns play in or would not play in, so the attorney general has given some guidance on this, so we’re contemplating all of that, and wanting to do what’s right for all Floridians. So, we’ll just continue to think it through. We’re again seeking input from various folks who have the expertise to help us understand and we’ll see how it goes,” he said.
Luis Valdes, Florida state director for Gun Owners of America (GOA), told the Phoenix that the right to open carry has come from the judicial system, “not the Republican supermajority in the Legislature.”
“GOA will fight tooth and nail to see this repeal passed,” Valdes said Friday. “But with the same leadership still in place, the battle against the RINOs in Tallahassee continues. We will continue with our simple message of NO COMPROMISE. We will fight to make sure all Floridians, 18 and up, can freely exercise their Second Amendment rights.”
The issue of open carry in Florida made headlines this week when Publix, the largest supermarket chain in the state, declared that the company would comply with state law.
“Treating customers with dignity and respect is a founding belief at Publix,” it said. “In any instance where a customer creates a threatening, erratic or dangerous shopping experience, whether they are openly carrying a firearm or not, we will engage local law enforcement to protect our customers and associates.”
The new law also came into play on Thursday night in Tampa, when a former candidate for Tampa city council allegedly brandished a gun after getting into an argument with another person following a candidate forum for an election taking place later this month. No charges were filed in that incident.

Gretchen Whitmer’s signature program designed to aid automakers’ transition to electric vehicles, which isn’t going so well.
Business lobbying groups that represent thousands of employers are exasperated.
The fiscal 2026 budget, heavily driven by the road repair and public safety priorities of Trumpian state House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township), ends funding for the Strategic Outreach and Attraction Reserve Fund, or SOAR.
SOAR was created by Whitmer and the Legislature in 2021 as a panicked response to Ford Motor Co. blindsiding the state by announcing a record $11.4 billion investment in a battery plant and vehicle assembly plant in Tennessee and two battery plants in Kentucky.
Lawmakers dropped $500 million from the corporate income tax into the SOAR fund in each of the past three years. But the new budget allocates no new cash for the business attraction fund.
Hall, who in an interview earlier this year complained that Michigan CEOs have gone “woke,” said whatever might replace SOAR will “end the days of cash giveaways, once and for all.”
Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) speaks at a press conference at the State Capitol on Oct. 7. Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan Advance.
The budget also cuts $40.7 billion from business attraction and community development money administered by the Michigan Economic Development Corp., just over 40% of the $100 million allocated in the fiscal 2025 budget that ended Sept. 30.
Lawmakers also nixed $10 million Whitmer requested to implement population growth recommendations from her 2023 Growing Michigan Together Council report.
“These incentives have made the state a more attractive place to do business,” MichAuto, an arm of the Detroit Regional Chamber that promotes the state’s auto industry, said in a statement. “(W)ithout an attractive suite of incentives, or a closing fund, Michigan businesses are at a disadvantage compared to national competitors with more resources of this sort.”
The cuts run so deep that the MEDC put out a news release telling the world it’s still in business.
What’s happening here is a growing bipartisan discontent over the value of business attraction incentives to create a significant number of good-paying jobs at a time when Michigan’s workforce is shrinking and the state is becoming steadily poorer compared to most states.
Michigan has fallen to 40th in per capita income, its lowest ranking ever, and slightly lower than the adjoining states of Indiana, Ohio and Wisconsin.
Minnesota’s per capita income of $74,943 in 2024 led the Great Lakes states last year, while Illinois was second at $74,197. Michigan trailed far behind at $63,221.
Business lobbying groups claim other changes and cuts in the new state budget will make it harder for them to develop talent and invest in innovations.
The budget cuts $22 million from the Going Pro Talent Fund, which gives job training grants to businesses.

And it decouples state and federal business taxes so that businesses won’t be able to take advantage of accelerated deduction schedules for capital expenditures under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act on their state taxes.
Decoupling prevents state government from losing $2 billion over the next five years, money it plans to spend on roads. A coalition of business groups regards the decoupling as a massive tax hike that will make investing in Michigan more expensive than in other states.
The “budget lands as our employers face a disproportionate risk from tariffs, the trade war and increasing uncertainty around electrification policies . . . adding further financial strain to many of our hometown companies,” Detroit Regional CEO Sandy Baruah said in a statement.
But Michigan’s economic challenges go far beyond the loss of economic development dollars in the new budget. The state has been losing ground to competing states for decades, regardless of which political party has controlled Lansing.
It’s long past time for policymakers to chart a new course for the state’s economy.
They can start by finally recognizing that chasing factory jobs is not the path to prosperity. Policymakers (and many of the rest of us) have a hard time accepting that the economy has shifted to services where most middle-class jobs are in labs and offices, not plant floors.
It was quite a tell when Ford Motor Co. CEO Jim Farley recently said some of the automakers’ younger hourly workers told him they needed three jobs to make ends meet. Even the “old-timers” told Farley that working in the company’s plants is no longer a viable career.
Despite President Donald Trump’s ballyhooed effort to restore manufacturing by hitting imported goods with stiff tariffs, the U.S. has lost 78,000 manufacturing jobs since August 2024. Michigan accounted for 9,000 of those lost jobs in that period.
Most states with high incomes and vibrant job markets have diverse economies and lots of college graduates. That should be top of mind for Whitmer and lawmakers as they rework Michigan’s economic development strategy.

If there’s a single factor that’s playing the largest role in spurring the dysfunction and divisiveness that plague modern American politics, gerrymandering – the intentional rigging of electoral districts for partisan purposes – is it. With the assistance of digital technology and recent judicial rulings that have given them complete carte blanche, state legislatures across the country are making a mockery of fair elections by drawing and redrawing electoral districts to assure partisan electoral outcomes even before the candidates are selected.
And sadly, one of the national poster children for this destructive trend is North Carolina, where in response to the demands of President Trump, Republican leaders have signaled a willingness to redraw the state’s already rigged U.S. House map to expand their 10-4 majority to 11-3. Recently, in order to learn more about the GOP scheme and a new poll that shows strong bipartisan opposition to it, Newsline caught up with one of our state’s leading defenders of democracy and fair elections, the executive director of Common Cause North Carolina, Bob Phillips.

Photo by Michelle Griffith/Minnesota Reformer.U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar endorsed Sen. Omar Fateh for Minneapolis mayor Sunday, giving the two-term state senator key support ahead of the Nov. 4 election.
“For many years, we have seen the concerns my neighbors and I are facing — about public safety, housing, affordability and so much more — be met with the same tired solutions or, frankly, none at all,” Omar said in a statement. “I have seen how dedicated (Fateh) is to our city and enacting the transformative change Minneapolis residents are demanding.”
If Omar brings the full weight of her political operation, including volunteers and fundraising, she could provide fuel to Fateh’s campaign just weeks away from Election Day.
DeWayne Davis, Mayor Jacob Frey and Jazz Hampton are the three other major candidates for mayor.
Omar’s endorsement of Fateh isn’t surprising, as the Minneapolis congresswoman and Frey have a longstanding political rivalry that’s often manifested through various proxies, and they’re also sharply divided by ideology and political alliances. Frey is supportive of the police department and the city’s business and real estate establishment.
In the run up to the last mayoral election in 2021, Omar endorsed two candidates for Minneapolis mayor and urged Minneapolis residents to not rank Frey at all on the ballot. Minneapolis uses ranked choice voting.
In the wake of the police murder of George Floyd, Omar also supported a ballot measure that would have replaced the Minneapolis Police Department with a new Department of Public Safety under the authority of the City Council. Frey opposed the charter amendment, which failed to pass.
The following year, Frey, who is the leader of the more moderate wing of city Democrats, endorsed Omar’s Democratic primary challenger Don Samuels for Congress, but Omar beat Samuels’ primary challenges in 2022 and 2024. Samuels’ campaigns were run by Frey advisor Joe Radinovich.
Fateh was first elected to the Minnesota Senate in 2020 as a democratic socialist looking to upend the establishment, upsetting a prominent DFL lawmaker in the primary. He supported a statewide $15 minimum wage and defunding the Minneapolis police after the murder of George Floyd.
In a statement, Fateh said Omar is a “fearless champion for working people and a strong voice for Minneapolis, and I’m proud to stand with her in the fight for a city that truly works for everyone.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/P1152812-1024x608.jpg,,,2025-10-13 11:59:39.808228

Though vaping was originally posed as an alternative to smoking cigarettes for older generations who grew up smoking, younger generations have begun vaping without a prior history of smoking. A recent survey showed that 21% of Missouri college students vape (Alex Buchanan/Missourian).Originally presented as a less-harmful alternative to smoking cigarettes, electronic cigarettes and vapor products have transitioned from an aid for addiction to an addiction of their own.
Vaping products were rolled out to help support a generation that grew up smoking. Over the years, however, younger generations have begun vaping without ever smoking in the first place.
According to a survey done by Partners in Prevention, a coalition that addresses student health behaviors, e-cigarette and vapor product use in Missouri college students is the highest it has been in the last five years at 21%.
Nicotine use in general is also at a high with 28%.
Brittany Carpenter, tobacco prevention coordinator for Missouri Partners in Prevention, said that she has seen vaping specifically target and affect the younger generation.
“They are potentially so much more addicted than we have seen historically in comparison to other products,” Carpenter said.
One of the main reasons is access.
Access to smoke shops, access to product use and access to more nicotine per hit have all altered the product’s purpose.
 Access to shops

If one was to look on Google Maps for a vape shop, there would be 20 smoke and vapor shops listed in Columbia.
Of those listed, two of them are concentrated in the downtown area, within walking distance of the University of Missouri, Columbia College and Stephens College campuses. Others are all within 10-15 minutes away by car.
Carpenter said that this could potentially be considered “targeting an intended audience.”
“Some of it could in fact be coincidental,” Carpenter said, “but looking at the history of the industry … proves that is in fact oftentimes purposeful.”
The vapor product industry targets young adults in more ways than one. Their bright colors and enticing flavors have been cited by users as one of the main reasons they started vaping in the first place.
According to pulmonary and critical care physician Kate Grossman, this targeting is a very effective business strategy to build an extremely loyal customer base.
“We know from people who smoke combustible cigarettes that if you start in adolescence you’re more likely to smoke as an adult, and the same holds true with vaping,” Grossman said.
 Access to products in public

Carpenter also said that the allowance of vaping in nonsmoking areas gives users more of an opportunity to use the product.
“People are able to use these products in places that they are not able to use traditional products like cigarettes,” Carpenter said.
This current access is why part of Partners in Prevention’s mission is to address policy changes and update the language to include vaping products and e-cigarettes in restrictions.
 Access to more nicotine

Not only are users of vapor products allowed to use their product in more spaces, but they may be getting more bang for their buck.
As Carpenter explains it, a cigarette contains one milligram of nicotine, whereas the majority of vaping products are not FDA approved and it cannot be known how much nicotine is in a cartridge.
It is known that the average JUUL pod contains about 20 milligrams of nicotine, giving vape users more nicotine per hit than they would get from a cigarette.
“People just don’t think about the equivalent amount of nicotine they’re inhaling just by doing a JUUL pod, which could end up being one to two packs of cigarettes,” Grossman said.
 Pro-vaping organizations are ongoing

While both Grossman and Carpenter said that they would not recommend vaping in nearly any circumstance, there are still groups that advocate for vaping as it was originally intended: as an alternative for smoking.
The Vapor Technology Association is an organization that works to defend vaping products and keep their use legal through lobbying.
The organization’s main demand is that all legislation made around nicotine products is based on science and not on fear.
According to VTA’s website, its goal for the last 10 years has been “defending the American vapor industry and the rights of adult Americans to choose their preferred vaping alternatives to cigarettes.”
Carpenter and Grossman both said that if vaping was the only way to wean a nonsmoker off, they would use it. Instead, they try to pursue other FDA approved tactics such as medications, the nicotine patch and other tobacco replacement products.
”I don’t like to hang my hat on that at all,” Grossman said, “because we do have other alternatives for quitting smoking that have FDA approval and good studies behind them.”

Despite the fact that they have yet to adopt a budget for the state fiscal year that commenced July 1, and are scheduled to return to Raleigh a couple more times this year, it appears that state lawmakers have wrapped up most of their action for the 2025 legislative session. And if that is in fact the case, one of the biggest losers in the Raleigh policy battles this year will have been our natural environment.
In addition to passing new laws to weaken important environmental protections, lawmakers have failed to fund a host of important public initiatives that are designed to clean up dangerous pollutants and strengthen communities to better withstand future natural disasters. And recently we caught up with one of our state’s top environmental policy experts — the Southeast Director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, Drew Ball – to learn some of the sobering details.

As Alaska’s population of working-age adults shrinks, according to economists, other demographic groups have become bigger segments of the labor force: seniors and teenagers.
Residents who are 65 and older made up 6.2% of the Alaska worker population in 2023 after steadily increasing over two decades, according to an analysis by the state Department of Labor and Workforce Development. In 2003, that age group made up just 1.8% of all working Alaskans, according to the data.
For teenagers, the two-decade trend has been different. In 2003, teenagers 14 to 17 years old made up 4.4% of Alaska’s resident workers, but that percentage dropped in subsequent years – reflecting national trends — until it bottomed out at 2.7% during the COVID-19 pandemic year of 2020. Since then, the percentage of teens in Alaska’s workforce rebounded, and it hit 3.7% in 2023.
The information is detailed in a pair of articles in the current issue of Alaska Economic Trends, the department’s monthly magazine published by the department’s research section. 
The analysis of  senior workers was written by state labor economist Karinne Wiebold; labor economist Rob Kreiger reported on the labor trends among  teenagers.
A big difference between older and younger workers is the degree of the male-female pay gap, Wiebold’s analysis showed.
For workers 65 and older, the gap is wide. Men in that age group had average annual earnings of $54,835, compared to average earnings of$38,797 for women 65 and older. 
In dollar terms, older women in Alaska earned 71 cents for every $1 earned by men 65 and older. 
The gap widens with age, the analysis found. The gap existed even in the highest-paid job category, the analysis found. Top male executives who were at least 65 years old earned $112,799 a year on average in 2024, while top female executives in the same age group earned an average of $87,514.
Statewide, across all age groups, women earn 73 cents for every $1 earned by men, her article said.
Wiebold said numerous factors contribute to the wage gap and the way it widens with age. Those might include historic discrimination, but other factors are work experience, training, education, hours worked, job and industry choice and time out of the workforce for reasons like childcare and elder care, she said.
“All of these choices and conditions are amplified with age,” she said by email.
In contrast, the male-female pay gap among teens aged 14 to 17 was very small, Kreiger’s analysis showed. On average, girls in that age group earned 96 cents for every $1 earned by boys in 2023, the statistics showed.
For the most part, teenaged boys and girls worked in similar jobs. Accommodation and food-service jobs accounted for more than a third of employment, while retail jobs accounted for 18.4%.
By working mostly in similar industries and at similarly entry-level positions, the teens “haven’t had time for other factors to influence the wage gap,” Weibold said.
Demographic shift
Alaska’s loss since 2013 of residents of prime working ages, considered to be 18 to 64, has been well-documented.
There are multiple and interplaying causes, said Dan Robinson, research chief for the Department of Labor and Workforce Development.
Part of the reason is net outmigration – with more people moving away from Alaska than moving to the state. Another factor is the aging of Alaska’s population, he said.
There are also numerous responses to the loss of Alaskans of prime working age residents. One has been more employment of nonresident workers, he said.
Nonresident hire hit a new record in 2023, the department said earlier this year.
Increased workforce participation by teens and seniors is part of the multifaceted picture, he said.
“For teens, it’s because a higher percentage of them have been working since the pandemic, and for seniors there are simply more of them,” Robinson said by email. “It could be that seniors are postponing retirement as a result of the worker shortage, and for teens they are likely lured into the labor force by recent wage growth in low wage jobs,”
State officials and employers have also taken actions to entice more seniors and teens into the workforce.
Last month, the state marked an official “Employ Older Workers Week,” with a Sept. 21 gubernatorial proclamation noting that “older workers play an increasingly important role in maintaining Alaska’s economy and leadership in the global marketplace, adding depth in perspective, social networks, and talent.”
The proclamation mentioned the Department of Labor and Workforce Development’s Mature Alaskans Seeking Skills Training program, which trains people 55 and older who might have encountered barriers to employment in the past, such as disabilities.
As for the young Alaskans, the Legislature this spring passed a bill allowing workers as young as 18 to serve alcohol at restaurants. Key support for the bill came from the Alaska Cabaret, Hotel, Restaurant, and Retailers Association, which cited a labor shortage as one of the significant challenges facing its members.
However, that labor shortage might not continue.
“There are early signs that the labor shortage is easing and we’re returning to a more normal balance between job openings and job seekers, but we’re still gathering and thinking about that data,” Robinson said.

Scott Kawasaki violated ethics law by holding constituent events too close to the 2024 state primary, a panel of the Alaska Legislature concluded in a report published Friday.
The report was published by the Senate subcommittee of the Legislature’s Select Committee on Legislative Ethics, which recommended no penalty.
Under the Legislative Ethics Act, a legislator in a campaign cannot use state funds “to print or distribute a political mass mailing to individuals eligible to vote for the candidate” if the mailing takes place during a period that begins 60 days before the primary election and ends one day after the general election.
According to the report, Kawasaki e-mailed constituents a newsletter, distributed informational flyers and held a “Picnic in the Park” event to observe the opening of his office in Fairbanks.
Kawasaki, who defeated Republican Leslie Hajdukovich in the November general election, faced only Hajdukovich in the primary, making the race uncontested. In Alaska, the top four vote-getters advance from the primary election to the general election. Kawasaki and Hajdukovich were the only two registered candidates.
Kawasaki was first elected to the Alaska State House of Representatives in 2007, and to the Senate in 2019. He ran for re-election in 2024 to represent Senate District P.
Reached by phone on Friday, Kawasaki said that “it’s just sort of disappointing to have this be said and politicized, and then it becomes a potential issue in the future campaign.”

(Photo by Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas’ legal aid group relies on remote court appearances in 22 counties in the southwest part of the state after losing its only attorney in the region in August, said Kansas Legal Services’ executive director, Matthew Keenan.
However, some judges refuse to allow virtual hearings or appearances. Others treat them as a default.
In response to inconsistent practices across courtrooms, the Kansas Supreme Court proposed a rule change to give judges a framework for holding remote appearances with the goal of increasing efficiency and access to the criminal justice system. The proposal, which is not yet in effect, has drawn mixed feelings from attorneys and judges, according to interviews and public comments submitted to the Supreme Court and obtained by Kansas Reflector.
“Kansas stands at a crossroads,” Keenan wrote in a submission dated Aug. 1. “The promise of equal justice under law cannot be fulfilled if we continue to tolerate a fragmented and discretionary approach to remote access — especially when we have the tools and technology to do better.”
While Keenan said in an Aug. 1 submission that the Supreme Court’s proposed rule offers an opportunity to ensure full access to justice, some judges see it differently.
“What we do in the courtroom is important, and it is dumbed-down when people are allowed to appear on the computer,” said Chief Judge Clinton Peterson in the 26th Judicial District, which covers the southwestern corner of the state, in a public comment dated Aug. 29 that was submitted to the Supreme Court.
“Litigants are more disrespectful. Attorneys are less professional. Remote hearings make judges look foolish and stupid,” he said.
Keenan said in-person court proceedings are the ideal, “without question.”
He said a clear and enforceable rule change allowing for presumptive remote appearances will modernize courts and better meet “constitutional mandates, public expectations and the realities of access to justice in rural and underserved areas.” 
Keenan named a number of judges, emphasizing those in rural counties with few attorneys available to represent low-income defendants, who are averse to remote appearances. He said a shift to default remote proceedings is not radical, but rational.
Kansas is staring down an attorney shortage, which is expected to worsen if attorneys continue to move away from rural areas and aging attorneys aren’t replaced by younger ones. 
 
The balance of justice
The rule attempts to balance the discretion afforded to judges while prioritizing equal access to justice. As proposed, it says a district court should hold remote proceedings or allow remote appearances if appropriate “to increase efficiency and access to the court.”
Judges would still retain discretion to deny a party’s request for a remote appearance under the rule, particularly if the request is untimely or if remote proceedings “would undermine the integrity, fairness, or effectiveness of the proceeding, such as when highly sensitive, particularly dense, or exhibit-heavy testimony is expected,” the rule said.
A court should consider a remote proceeding under the proposed rule if all parties agree, the proceeding is preliminary or for scheduling purposes, the time and expense of travel for an in-person appearance outweighs the benefits, a remote proceeding would increase access to court or help address an attorney shortage, or if a party has health concerns about attending in-person proceedings.
A group of Wichita attorneys said the Supreme Court’s proposed rule “appears to lack deference to a vital component: the consent of criminal defendants.”
A defendant has a right to be present at every appearance during their prosecution, said attorneys Dan Monnat, Eli O’Brien and Braxton Eck of the firm Monnat & Spurrier in an Aug. 4 joint letter. They said the Supreme Court should add a requirement that a court should not hold a remote hearing or permit a remote appearance if a criminal defendant objects.
“As criminal defense attorneys, we contend that the defendant has a right to be present at every single proceeding or appearance in their prosecution because a simple scheduling conference can turn into a debate about case evidence,” the attorneys wrote. “An uncontested motions hearing can become a highly contested proceeding in which the fate of the defendant’s case is decided.”
Chief Judge Bruce Gatterman of the 24th Judicial District prefaced his July 30 written public comment with the acknowledgement that he frequently uses remote proceedings.
He said they are an “invaluable tool” for the only district judge in a rural, six-county district in west-central Kansas, especially for security, preliminary or procedural issues, emergencies or summary dockets. But he said he was concerned with the way judicial discretion is treated in the rule.
“I believe the proposed rule, as written, intrudes upon judicial discretion,” he said.
He proposed eliminating the list of reasons included within the rule to guide a court’s decision to allow or deny remote proceedings.
Other judges proposed tinkering with the rule’s language, favoring wording that doesn’t bind judges to hold virtual hearings. Van Hampton, a Dodge City-based attorney, wrote in a public comment dated July 10 that the Supreme Court should go a step further and make the rule mandatory. He, like Keenan, named judges who prohibit remote proceedings.
“This practice is abusive to attorneys who reside many miles away from the District and are required by the presiding judge to travel several hours to appear for a 5-minute scheduling or ‘status’ hearing,” Hampton wrote. “This is nothing less than an attempt to punish ‘out of town’ counsel for representing parties in the abusive judge’s District.”
 
Not a ‘cure-all’
The national average of attorney-to-resident ratio is around 4 attorneys for every 1,000 residents, according to the American Bar Association.
In Kansas, some judicial districts have fewer than one attorney. Two have none.
Nearly 80% of Kansas attorneys live in five counties containing about half of the state’s population. Those are Douglas, Johnson, Sedgwick, Shawnee and Wyandotte counties. And about one-third of attorneys in the state are over the age of 60, according data from the state Supreme Court.
While the Supreme Court’s proposed rule appears to be a “common sense” move, in Ann Sagan’s eyes, it’s not a cure-all.
Sagan is the new executive director of the Kansas State Board of Indigents’ Defense Services, the public defender agency that supplies attorneys for people who are charged with crimes and can’t afford one.
“Because of the rural attorney shortage, our agency has had to pay attorneys from urban areas to travel hundreds of miles across Kansas to represent defendants in rural areas,” she said in an email. “We will face even deeper attorney shortages as more and more lawyers in rural areas retire.”
The proposed rule seems to address the problems that have arisen out of the rural attorney shortage, Sagan said.
“However, it is essential that any application of this rule by the courts is done in a way that will protect the defendant’s constitutional rights and the public’s right to access the courts,” Sagan said.
It will not solve the rural attorney shortage, she said.
 
Rural rules
The Kansas Supreme Court created a Rural Justice Initiative Committee in 2022, charging it with examining the state’s attorney shortage, which one state Supreme Court judge said has approached a constitutional crisis.
The committee considered remote hearings as a way to address rural access woes, but it did not make a clear recommendation. The committee’s final report, which was released in 2024, said it extensively researched and studied digital tools to improve access to justice in rural Kansas. It articulated some of the same issues that have arisen in the wake of the Supreme Court’s proposed rule.
“Some members advocated for a rule mandating remote hearings in all rural Kansas courtrooms,” the report said. “Others argued that rural Kansas would be better served with more attorneys living and working in rural Kansas, and a mandatory rule detracts from that mission.”
The Kansas Supreme Court proposed the remote rule change in July, soliciting public comments until August. Lisa Taylor, the public information director for the Kansas Office of Judicial Administration, said the court received feedback from judge groups and bar association committees in addition to public comments. She said that after the public comment period for a proposed rule ends, the submissions are compiled and shared with the Supreme Court. 
“The court has discretion when it decides what to do next,” she said in an email. “Among the options are to adopt the rule as proposed or with amendments, to make additional amendments and reopen it for public comment, or to take no action at all.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/P8230030-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-10-13 10:57:37.394618

(Getty Images)Indiana tax collections are running $270 million ahead of projections after three months of the fiscal year, according to the latest monthly revenue report.
The revenue is even stronger compared to the prior year’s first quarter — about $532 million, or a 10.7% increase.
“Our state’s monthly revenue report once again exceeds expectations — proof that the strong, pro-growth foundation built under President Trump continues to fuel our economy,” said Gov. Mike Braun. “We’ll keep building on that momentum to deliver results for Hoosiers through fiscal responsibility and conservative leadership.”
The fiscal year runs from July 1, 2025, to June 30, 2026.
Revenue for Indiana’s general fund for September was $313.6 million higher than the same time last year — a 15.6% increase. And it was $131 million more than expected under the latest revenue forecast.
Sales tax revenue has been especially strong — up 6% in September and 9% above the prior year.
Individual income taxes over the first three months of the fiscal year have grown $205 million over the prior year, or nearly 12%.
The forecast was downgraded by more than $2 billion in early April — leading to major cuts in the state budget. Agencies generally have been forced to reduce their spending by 10%. That has led to slashing Indiana’s child care programs and laying off state workers, among other cuts.

On the far east side of Michigan, the future of fluoride in drinking water — long an ordinary practice for preventing tooth decay — has suddenly provoked passionate debate.
Public meetings in St. Clair County, about an hour northeast of Detroit, have filled with people weighing in. One man waved his Fixodent denture cream before the county commissioners, suggesting that his own experience showed what would happen if local communities stopped treatment.
“I am an unfluoridated child,” he declared, “with a set of uppers and lowers.”
Another man, speaking to the county’s Advisory Board of Health, said that personal responsibility should be factored into the conversation. “I think there are some 3 Musketeer bars, Snicker bars that should be accounted for. Some Coca-Colas.”
And a young man used his time in the public comments to address not just fluoridation, but the county medical director who’s trying to get rid of it. He accused him of grandstanding to land a job with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the U.S. health and human services secretary, by making moves that “lowered the quality of life for underserved people.”
The raucous arguments were spurred by a three-page memo sent in June to the Advisory Health Board by Dr. Remington Nevin, the medical director of St. Clair County’s Health Department. It urges the department to take steps to “prohibit the addition of fluoride” to public water systems because, he wrote in bold print, the additive is “a plausible developmental neurotoxicant” — a claim that runs counter to the assessment of many leading experts and health agencies, which have long celebrated fluoridation as a public health triumph.
Nevin recommended fluoride restrictions that would apply to any system located in the county and serving county residents. Potentially, that could include the Great Lakes Water Authority, which provides water to nearly 40% of the state’s population.
Drinking water fluoridation, which was pioneered in Michigan in 1945, led to a massive drop in tooth decay. Even with the rise of fluoride in toothpaste and other products, it’s credited with a 25% decrease in cavities. But skeptics increasingly hold sway in government, as ProPublica recently reported. Those opponents include Kennedy, the nation’s top health official, who has called fluoride “industrial waste.”
Now the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Environmental Protection Agency are reviewing their approaches to fluoride in drinking water, and Utah and Florida became the first states to ban fluoridation.
Local communities, though, are on the front lines of the fluoride wars in most states, typically deciding whether or not to continue fluoridating their drinking water by council vote or community referendum. The public conversation in St. Clair County offers a vivid example of how contentious the issue can become. Advocates from well beyond its borders are getting involved, saying that what happens in the county has implications for the entire state.
Home to about 160,000 residents at the base of Michigan’s Thumb, St. Clair County shares a watery border with Canada. Some 67% of its voters chose President Donald Trump in the 2024 election. (Kennedy got under 1% of the vote.) About 110,000 residents receive fluoridated drinking water, according to the state’s environmental agency, while an additional 6,510 are served by water supplies with naturally occurring fluoride.
In his memo this summer, Nevin, who is a physician epidemiologist, cited a state-of-the-science report from the National Toxicology Program last year that described an association between higher levels of fluoride exposure and lower IQs in children. (The NTP is an interagency program within the Department of Health and Human Services that’s focused on toxicology research.)
Nevin also referenced a court decision in a case filed against the EPA by groups opposed to fluoridation, where a district judge relied, in part, on the NTP report in ruling that fluoride presented an “unreasonable risk.” Even as it appeals the decision, the EPA said its review of new science on fluoride in drinking water “is being done in coordination with Secretary Kennedy and HHS.”

The NTP report, though, is contested and based on limited studies involving fluoride levels that are more than twice the amount recommended by the federal government. Its own abstract says there isn’t enough information to link lower fluoride exposure with children’s IQ.
Nevin’s memo said that the EPA may take months or years to act on fluoride, but that didn’t mean local officials had to wait. “Across the Michigan Thumb, several townships have expressed a desire for similar measures,” he wrote, “and within St. Clair County, I have received a number of resident concerns related to this issue.” He recommended new regulations that would prohibit the addition of “any form of fluoride” to public water systems in the county that serve residents.
In Michigan, each community decides for itself if it will maintain fluoride in its drinking water system. But in an email to ProPublica, Nevin laid out a process where the St. Clair County Board of Commissioners could approve regulations that, in the name of public health, restrict the ability of suppliers to use the additive — in effect, enacting sweeping change throughout the region.
“Just as items manufactured in California are often subject to more stringent California environmental and health regulations, even if the majority are sold outside the state; so too could drinking water produced in St. Clair County be subject to more stringent county regulations, even if the majority is exported to other counties,” he wrote.
Whether or not this applies to any future fluoride regulations depends on the language that is adopted and approved, he added.
The state Department of Health and Human Services says it knows of no local health departments that have attempted such restrictions. In response to ProPublica’s queries, the Great Lakes Water Authority shared a May statement about fluoride, which says that the agency is required by its owner, the city of Detroit, to fluoridate its water supply. The current dosage is well below the maximum established by the Safe Drinking Water Act and the EPA, the statement said, and is in line with the recommended target for oral health benefits.
The water authority, which serves southeast Michigan, didn’t address the St. Clair County proposal. And it’s unclear whether the push for broad county regulations will gain traction.
As medical director, Nevin has an influential voice with county officials and shares guidance with Liz King, the county’s health officer-director. King, however, expressed reservations about Nevin’s proposal at a July meeting of the Advisory Health Board, according to the minutes.
In a statement to ProPublica, King said: “I do not support county-wide mandates to remove fluoride or actions that override the authority of local jurisdictions, unless there is an emergent or urgent public health need.”
Nevin was new to Michigan when he joined the Health Department in his part-time position about two years ago. He soon established that he would be an active force. He describes it in an email to ProPublica as “counter-activism,” adding: “I am largely working to counter the radical agendas of many past and current state public health officials.”
At the January meeting of the Advisory Health Board, Nevin provided members with a 2022 book by Kennedy — “A Letter to Liberals: Censorship and COVID: An Attack on Science and American Ideals” — that’s critical of the Democratic Party and government restrictions enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic. (To the notion that he wants to work for Kennedy, Nevin told ProPublica that it’s “baseless conjecture” and that he’s happy in St. Clair County.)
Less than a year into his tenure as HHS secretary, Kennedy’s approach was challenged by six former surgeons general who served under both Republicans and Democrats. In a recent op-ed, they said that Kennedy is “endangering the health of the nation.” His agency criticized their track records in office when contacted by ProPublica about the op-ed, saying they failed to improve public health.
Nevin has moved to make vaccine exemptions easier to get, saying in an April memo that it would “improve the public’s trust in public health.” Those efforts helped earn him a tribute signed by 10 Republican state legislators, which also highlights his fluoride recommendations. Nevin also successfully pushed for the department to wind down services at school health clinics, arguing, in part, that providing direct primary care isn’t a core function of public health.
Supporters point to his training in the military and at Johns Hopkins University. In addition to a medical degree, his CV lists a master’s degree and doctorate in public health. On his website, Nevin also highlights his ability to serve as an expert witness and consultant in legal cases that involve adverse effects from certain antimalarial drugs.
Nevin told ProPublica that past experience taught him that it can take years for neurotoxic effects of certain substances to be recognized. “I have every confidence that, in due course, fluoride will also be looked upon as a neurotoxicant that has no place being ingested,” he wrote in an email.
He added that the response he’s received to his proposal from the community “has been overwhelmingly positive.”

But there’s been strong pushback. Dr. Randa Jundi-Samman, a recently retired dentist in St. Clair County, was one of the health professionals speaking in support of fluoridation at public meetings. She told ProPublica that dropping fluoridation would be a serious hit to community health.
“You’d 100% get more decay, especially in children in low-income communities that don’t get the chance to go to the dentist every six months,” Jundi-Samman said. “We certainly will see that. We already see it in people who don’t have fluoride in their water.”
Dr. Mert Aksu, president of the Michigan Oral Health Coalition’s board and dean of the University of Detroit Mercy’s dental school, said he’s hustling up to the public meetings in St. Clair County because it’s the duty of professionals “to make sure that the decisions that are being made within our communities are being made based upon scientific merit.”
Speaking broadly about the influence now wielded by fluoride skeptics, Aksu said, “We have opened ourselves up to opportunities from misinformed people who want to use this issue for political purposes.”
At an August meeting of the county commissioners, Kimberly Raleigh, interim executive director of the Michigan Oral Health Coalition, read a letter in support of fluoridation that was signed by the University of Michigan School of Dentistry, the Michigan Dental Association, the Indiana Dental Association, the Pennsylvania Coalition for Oral Health and dozens of others.

Nevin said in an email that the dental community “must recognize that community water fluoridation can no longer be relied upon to mask the dental problems created by our neglect of poor dietary choices.”
He argues that he has science on his side. “Scientific merit favors a recommendation to prohibit fluoride,” he wrote to ProPublica. “I have every confidence this will become much clearer in the coming months, as further federal guidance is inevitably released.”
Nevin’s recommendation is before the Advisory Health Board, which also was provided a fact sheet on fluoridation from the Health Department, submitted with Nevin’s approval. If the board endorses his proposal, King may then decide whether to propose regulations, which the Board of Commissioners would then weigh, according to the Health Department. Nevin estimated that the process could take six to 12 months.
Fluoride was on the agenda for the Advisory Health Board’s September meeting, which ended early because the members failed to reach a quorum. Nevin told ProPublica that he expects it to be discussed at this week’s meeting, and that he will present additional information then.
Meanwhile, Nevin has already influenced one of the county’s townships, Kimball, which receives treated water from Port Huron, the seat of St. Clair County.
At an August meeting, where Nevin spoke to the Board of Trustees, Kimball Township unanimously passed a resolution calling for Port Huron to discontinue fluoridation and direct any funds saved to support access to topical dental fluoride treatments.
Port Huron’s city manager declined to comment for this story, saying the township has not presented the city with any resolution or request. Nevin said in an email to ProPublica that he is “attempting to address every municipality in the county” with similar testimony.
After voting on the measure, one Kimball trustee made a point to show support for Nevin, saying “we’re blessed to have him making decisions.”
Nevin, he said, has had to overcome resistance from staff “pushing hard to make his life rather uncomfortable.”
“They’re not used to leadership,” the trustee said. “They’re not used to boldness. They’re not used to maybe some male energy that’s necessary to get things done.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-13-060619.png,,,2025-10-13 10:57:37.394618

Seven Missouri Head Start kitchens are set to receive nearly $2 million in grants from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services as part of the office’s efforts to promote healthy eating and nutritious foods.
The funding comes as part of a push from HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whose office rolled out the “Make Our Children Healthy Again Strategy” in early September. HHS said in a press release that $61 million in funding will assist more than 100,000 children and families across the country.
In Missouri, it will pay for kitchen upgrades, community gardens, bulk cooking lessons and more.
 How Head Start programs are taking on nutrition education 

July data from the Interdisciplinary Center for Food Security at the University of Missouri found that between 2021 and 2023, an average of 12.7% of Missouri homes experienced food insecurity, a 10% increase compared to the period between 2018 and 2020.
That equates to nearly 780,000 Missourians. Of those, about 356,000 are experiencing very low food security, where eating habits are interrupted.
For many children, a meal at Head Start schools will be the most nutritious they get all day, 2021 research from the U.S. Department of Agriculture shows.
Lunches provided in Head Start centers provided more than the benchmark levels for vegetables, grains, bread, dairy and protein foods, while breakfasts exceeded benchmark levels for fruit, grains and dairy.
On days when children were in child care programs, meals and snacks contributed to 40% of calories a child consumed that day. And in Missouri, Head Start kitchens play a crucial role in addressing increasing food insecurity rates. In April, the federal government closed five of the 10 regional Head Start offices and fired staff, although legal challenges are underway.
For nutrition coordinators across the state’s Head Start programs, the funding presented a rare opportunity for essential upgrades. Many Head Start kitchens use commercial kitchen equipment, which can cost thousands of dollars to upgrade or replace.
“The majority of our money does go directly to providing the services for the children,” said Kayla Marmaud, the community relations director for the Community Action Partnership of Greater St. Joseph. “When you have funding that goes for the children in your care directly, some of the other things are put on the back burner.”
HHS required that half of the overall funding be used for materials, supplies and equipment for farm-to-table strategies, cooking demonstrations and appliance upgrades. Another quarter of the funding goes toward food service upgrades and sourcing local nutritious foods, while the remainder of the money will contribute to education, workshops and community events.
In Springfield, Head Start staff kept a running list of upgrades that were needed. When the funding was announced, they were able to check that list and pick top priorities.
“We selected the things that we felt like were the most pressing issues, or the ones that could give us the biggest bang for our buck, knowing that this is a one-time and not continuing project,” said Kimberly Shinn-Brown, the Head Start program director at Ozarks Area Community Action in Springfield.
They plan to make food service upgrades, as well as a slew of upgrades to their Head Start locations that have residential-style kitchens. Part of that means making the kitchens easier to use and work in for their staff, Shinn-Brown said.
Ozarks Area Community Action and others are also pursuing educational programs to help benefit their families. In Springfield, they requested money to bring on a new nutrition education program aimed at Gen Z families. The program sends out tidbits of information over text, so families can more easily incorporate nutrition education into their lives.
“They don’t want to talk to someone on the phone, and they don’t necessarily want to have a face-to-face meeting with you,” Shinn-Brown said. “But they do tend to be responsive if you text them.”
“It doesn’t matter how great your resources are if people won’t use them,” she said. “So we wanted to look at how our parents are accessing information, and what are their preferences?”
Daphne Graham, the health and nutrition coordinator at Ozark Action in West Plains, Missouri, knew the organization would have five new Early Head Start centers opening this fall, and requested funds to help with breastfeeding rooms for their families in those new centers.
They also are expanding meal options for parents of kids enrolled in Head Start to help showcase some of the cooking and exposure to different foods their kids get at school. The organization also plans to purchase more than 40 vacuum seal kits to give away to families across their 22 Head Start classrooms, with plans to help families learn more about batch cooking and preservation.
“Our demographic is very low-income … families that are sometimes just barely getting by as it is, and maybe education is not something they enjoy,” said Graham. “They don’t want to sit and listen to a lecture, but they would take in so much more in-person, so that’s where our education is going.”
In St. Joseph, they are applying those same principles to build community gardens at some of their Head Start schools and to create a new demonstration kitchen that will bring families closer to food.
“With the cost of food increasing, our resources sometimes tend to be more limited,” said Marmaud. “We wanted to be able to provide an opportunity that we could have community partners come in and be able to teach people how to get the most out of their resources.”
That sort of hands-on learning is shown to increase uptake of nutritious foods, said Lauren Landfried, a dietitian and associate professor in the St. Louis University Department of Nutrition and Dietetics.
“Getting kids exposure early is hugely impactful for their future health,” Landfried said. “If the kids are able to be a part of any of this, they’re more likely to consume the food. They’re more likely to have that positive relationship to expose others, too.”
 What is needed to create more nutritious meals for Head Start?  

Although the one-time funding was a welcome start to the winter months, critics argue that the funding does not go far enough in the face of cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and its sister program, SNAP-Ed, which provides nutrition education and other programs that address food insecurity.
“Any funding that goes to enhance nutrition education should be applauded and celebrated,” said Clarissa Hayes, the deputy director of child nutrition programs and policy at the Food Research and Action Center. “But at the end of the day, we know that this funding is not enough and it’s really putting a Band-Aid on the issue.”
Under new requirements for SNAP, most individuals will be required to show proof of 80 hours of work, caregiving, schooling or volunteering to receive benefits. In Missouri, that could equate to about 150,000 people losing food assistance benefits.
And under a new waiver request from Gov. Mike Kehoe, the food items SNAP pays for are set to change. The changes would bar SNAP recipients from buying soda and candy, similar to recent changes made in Kansas.
“The problem is not everybody knows how to cook,” Landfried said. “The assumption is that the people know what to do with the food that they are prescribed, which is not the case. In my experience, I had to do a lot of education on how to cook.”
Both Landfried and Hayes see the reliance on other assistance like food banks increasing while families try to stretch their spending on food.
Ultimately, these one-time dollars won’t do much to address the food insecurity issues rising across Missouri, Hayes said.
“It’s not enough,” she said. “It’s very hypocritical in light of all of the other cuts that this administration has made to the nutrition safety net.”

Immigrants’ rights groups and child advocates say the new law will help parents prepare for emergencies, such as a deportation. It caused a firestorm of controversy among conservative and religious activists who said it would allow adults to traffic kids.


Gov. Gavin Newsom on Sunday signed a bill allowing a broad range of relatives to step in as children’s caregivers if their parents are deported, a measure that had provoked a firestorm of conservative criticism.
Assembly Bill 495 will also bar daycare providers from collecting immigration information about a child or their parents, and allow parents to nominate a temporary legal guardian for their child in family court. 
“We are putting on record that we stand by our families and their right to keep their private information safe, maintain parental rights and help families prepare in case of emergencies,” Newsom said in a press release.
It was one of several measures the Democratic-dominated Legislature pushed this year in response to the Trump administration’s aggressive deportation crackdown in Los Angeles and across California. Newsom, a Democrat, signed several of those other bills — banning Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents from wearing masks in the state and requiring schools and hospitals to require warrants when officers show up — in a ceremony in L.A. last month. 
He left AB 495 undecided for weeks, prompting a flurry of advocacy by immigrants’ rights groups to secure Newsom’s signature in the face of intense pushback from conservative activists. The governor announced his decision the day before his deadline to sign or veto the over 800 bills lawmakers sent to his desk last month.
The most controversial aspect of the bill concerns an obscure, decades-old form called a caregiver’s authorization affidavit. Relatives of a child whose parents are temporarily unavailable, and with whom the child is living, can attest to being the child’s caregiver; the designation allows the adult to enroll the child in school, take them to the doctor and consent to medical and dental care.
The new law will broaden who is allowed to sign the caregiver affidavit, from more traditional definitions of relatives to any adult in the family who is “related to the child by blood, adoption, or affinity within the fifth degree of kinship,” which includes people like great aunts or cousins. Parents can cancel the caregiver designation, which is intended to be a temporary arrangement and does not give that person custody.
Proponents said parents at risk of deportation should get to choose someone trusted to care for their children if ICE detains them. Expanding who is eligible for the caregiver form, they said, gives immigrant parents more options because they may not have close relatives in the country but benefit from strong ties with extended family or informal community networks.
The legislation was backed by immigrants’ rights groups and children’s advocates such as the Alliance for Children’s Rights and First 5 California. 
“I introduced this bill so children do not have to wonder what will happen to them if their parents are not able to pick them up from school,” bill author Assemblymember Celeste Rodriguez, an Arleta Democrat, said at a recent press conference. 
Critics claim strangers could get custody
But Republicans, the religious right and parental rights’ activists argued the bill would instead endanger children. 
They claimed it would allow strangers to sign the affidavit and claim the child into their care. Hundreds of opponents showed up at the Capitol by busload to rally against the legislation, organized by Pastor Jack Hibbs of the Calvary Chapel Chino Hills megachurch, who called it “the most dangerous bill we’ve seen” in Sacramento. Some of the blowback stemmed from false claims that the bill would allow strangers to get custody of children to whom they’re not related.
Assemblymember Carl DeMaio, a San Diego Republican, called the legislation “a human trafficker’s dream.”
In an email, Greg Burton, vice president of the California Family Council, took issue with the fact that parents might not be there when the affidavit form is signed. 
“What are parental rights?” he wrote. “These rights are nothing if someone else can claim them by simply signing a form.”
Over the summer Rodriguez narrowed the legislation to exclude “nonrelative extended family members” but it was not enough to quell the controversy. The legislation passed along party lines.
In comparison to a fairly progressive Legislature, the governor has often positioned himself as a moderating force on child custody and protection issues, which regularly galvanize conservative activists and put California Democrats on the defensive. In 2023 he vetoed a bill that would have required family court judges to consider a parent’s support of a child’s gender transition in custody disputes. 
At a press conference last week where activists urged Newsom to sign the bill, Angelica Salas, executive director of the Coalition for Humane Immigrants’ Rights Los Angeles, asked the governor “to not listen to the lies, to not listen to all the other stuff that’s being said about this bill.”
Newsom, announcing his decision, quietly acknowledged the controversy in a press release. He included statements he said were “correcting the record” on mischaracterizations and said the new law does not change the fact that parental rights and legal guardianships must be decided by family court judges.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/020825_Duran-Family_JAJ_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-13 09:01:57.723738

The biggest study yet on California’s tough-on-crime ballot measure Proposition 36 shows few people are finding their way into the treatment it promised.


It’s been nearly a year since Californians overwhelmingly approved Proposition 36, a tough-on-crime measure providing what backers called “mass treatment” for those facing certain drug charges. But few defendants have found a clear path to recovery under the law, according to new data released by the state. 
Prop. 36 gave prosecutors the ability to charge people convicted of various third-time drug offenses with a so-called treatment-mandated felony, which would give them a choice between behavioral health treatment or up to three years in jail or prison. If they accept, they would enter a guilty or no contest plea and begin treatment. Those who complete treatment have their charges dismissed.
In the first six months since the law took effect, roughly 9,000 people have been charged with a treatment-mandated felony, according to the first-of-its-kind report released this month by the state’s Judicial Council. Nearly 15% — or 1,290 people — elected treatment. 
So far, of the 771 people placed into treatment, 25 completed it. 
The data reflects how different counties are using the law, with the highest number of treatment-mandated felonies charged in Orange County at 2,395. Kings and Napa counties each had one such charge.
San Diego County accounted for roughly one-third — or 427 of 1,290 — cases in which defendants chose to pursue treatment, but did not report how many were placed into treatment or completed it. 
The report notes that this missing data contributes to “a substantial portion of the drop-off” in regards to the overall number of people who elected treatment but have not yet been placed. 
Francine Byrne, director of criminal justice services at the Judicial Council, said counties are still figuring out how to implement the law — and in many jurisdictions, it can take people a while to opt-in to treatment as they move through the court process.
“It’s not acceptable that so few people are actually going into treatment,” said Jonathan Raven, an executive at the California District Attorneys Association, which supported the measure. “The goal of this ballot measure was to take that population of people who have a substance use disorder and get them help, find them a pathway out of the criminal justice system and dismiss their cases. And that doesn’t seem to be what’s happening across the state.”
Raven said that district attorneys have been trying to implement Prop. 36 based on the will of the voters, but have been doing it “with one hand tied behind their back.” 
The measure did not include dedicated funding when voters passed it, which was one of the reasons why Gov. Gavin Newsom opposed the measure. Behavioral health experts have long sounded the alarm over the lack of behavioral health treatment and staffing across California, but proponents argued that Prop. 36 would be the great “forcing function” for the state to scale up treatment. 
Since the law passed, Republican and Democratic state lawmakers requested upwards of $600 million annually to implement it. Newsom and the Legislature ultimately approved a one-time state budget allocation of $100 million. 
On top of that, Newsom last month announced that the state had awarded $127 million in grant funding to build more behavioral health treatment capacity. Those funds were made available through Proposition 47, a 2014 voter-approved measure that reduced the penalties for certain non-violent drug and property crimes and stipulated that the resulting savings would be used for, among other things, substance use disorder and mental health treatment.
None of that funding was available during the time period associated with the report, which looked at case counts between Dec. 18 and April 30. 
Kate Chatfield, executive director of the California Public Defenders Association said the data proves that Prop. 36 “is a fail” — not because people are treatment resistant but because treatment is not available. 
“There’s no indication that anything will change,” she said. “Meanwhile, proponents are spending precious county resources on prosecution and incarceration in local jails and saying — magically — some money will appear for treatment. Proponents are the ones preventing those resources from being spent on treatment.”

(Photo by Ronda Churchill/Nevada Current)A private equity watchdog group hopes a recent settlement reached between Nevada and an apartment rental pricing software company marks the start of reining in practices nationally that critics say allows landlords to fix prices on rents.
Nevada Democratic Attorney General Aaron Ford announced the settlement with RealPage, a real estate software firm, last month. In the settlement, RealPage denied any wrongdoing or liability of any kind, but agreed to provisions that limits the company from using nonpublic data when calculating rent recommendations for its Nevada clients.
Nevada’s suit, which had accused the company of violating the state’s Unfair Trade Practices Act, is notable because it was the first state to settle directly with RealPage, said K Agbebiyi, the senior housing campaign coordinator at the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, a nonprofit that monitors the growing impacts of private equity ownership in the U.S. economy.
Though the settlement will provide “immediate relief” to some tenants, more needs to be done to rein in corporate landlords and bolster renter protections, according to the nonprofit. 
“I think this lawsuit is a good stopgap, but we need a huge overhaul for tenants to actually have rights in this country,” Agbebiyi said. 
Real estate software companies, including RealPage, have been sued by several state attorneys general and the federal government in recent years for allegedly artificially inflating rent prices. 
RealPage, and property management groups that have relied on software, have repeatedly denied wrongdoing.
Property management companies like Greystar, which manages properties in Nevada, have been at the center of federal and state lawsuits. Many of those companies have recently reached multimillion dollar settlements for allegations of using software made by RealPage to fix prices. 
Under the settlement, RealPage can only use nonpublic data to generate recommended rent rates for properties if the data is anonymized, at least three months old, and aggregated across at least 10 properties.
RealPage is also paying $200,000, which is going toward rent relief and down payment assistance programs. 
Similar lawsuits in other states are still pending. If successful, Agbebiyi thinks settlement amounts will be nominal, as in Nevada, but the cases will do a lot to chip away at the company’s ability to use its software to the detriment of renters.
Ford, who is running for governor, has called the settlement “a win for Nevada renters who would otherwise have been kept from the benefits of free market competition like lower rental prices and better leasing terms.” 
If other states get similar rulings, Agbebiyi said, “I don’t understand how it’s going to be financially feasible for RealPage to operate when the price sharing component of their software was the primary reason that people were using their software.”
Litigation could also prevent property management companies and landlords from using algorithms to artificially raise rents, but it won’t end price fixing outright without stronger tenant protections, Agbebiyi said.
Nevada is among five states PESP identified as “very risk prone” for an influx of private equity in various economic sectors, including housing and health care. 
“Where we see private equity make a lot of investments are in states where there’s not a lot of regulation that would prevent them from maximizing profit,” said Sam Garin, the senior communications coordinator for the nonprofit.
The nonprofit’s private equity risk assessment found Nevada is among the top 10 states for the percentage of single-family homes purchased by corporate investors over a five-year period. 
In order to rein in private equity, the group suggests legislation that states could take up, including: 

Adopting good cause eviction laws, which require landlords to identify a valid reason for an eviction or nonrenewal of a lease; 
Capping annual rent increases statewide at rates no higher than inflation;
Creating a landlord registry to identify beneficial ownership of all corporate landlords.

Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo vetoed legislation in 2023 that would have limited the number of units corporate investors could purchase each year.
The legislation was revived in 2025 and sought to limit investors from buying more than 100 units per year. But Lombardo killed it behind the scenes.
While Democratic lawmakers have backed rent stabilization for seniors for a one year period – also twice vetoed by Lombardo – some Democratic legislative leaders, including Speaker Steve Yeager, have opposed broader rent stabilization proposals.
The importance of being vigilant
A 2022 ProPublica investigation found rental pricing software by RealPage used algorithms, collected through lease transaction data and advertised rates, to effectively tell landlords the highest rent an apartment applicant is able to pay, and then charge it. 
The reporting has since led for a wave of federal and state actions to rein in the practice. Under the Biden administration, the  Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice both sued RealPage and property management companies that rely on its software.
“When Trump was elected, people were kind of worrying or wondering if the lawsuits would continue,” Agbebiyi said, adding that in the last 10 months there aren’t any “indications that RealPage can count on the Trump administration to help them out.”
The nonprofit has tracked at least 22 states in the last year that have “introduced over 44 pieces of anti RealPage legislation” seeking to rein in rental price fixing at the state and local level, Agbebiyi said.
Even if those efforts aren’t successful, “just the fact that it’s in the conversation, and also the fact that the efforts against RealPage are so bipartisan, I think that’s a really good sign,” they said. “It still shows that there’s still a huge movement against RealPage.”
Ford introduced Assembly Bill 44 in the 2025 legislation session attempting to regulate price fixing of essential goods and services, including shelter, food and medicine. It passed both chambers in a mostly party-line vote.
Democratic Assemblymembers Joe Dailia, Duy Nguyen, and Venise Karris joined Republicans to oppose the bill in the Assembly, where it passed 24-18. Republican state Sen. John Steinbeck joined Democrats in the Senate to support the bill, where it passed 14-7.
Lombardo vetoed the legislation, calling it “a striking case of government overreach” and “inherently broad and open to wide interpretation, likely making enforcement subjective and inconsistent.”
State-level efforts to combat rental price fixing aren’t fixed by a single lawsuit or piece of legislation, Agbebiyi warned.
“At the end of the day, all of these are fixes that can provide immediate relief to tenants,” they said. But without more aggressive regulation of industry practices, “landlords are going to find a way to circumvent the rules and to raise tenant prices.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Ronda-housing-aerial-cropped-Housing_RondaChurchill_012-aerial-vista-2-1024x680.jpg,,,2025-10-13 09:01:57.723738

(Photo by Feifei Cui-Paoluzzo/Getty Images)Neighboring an area that’s becoming the heart of geothermal technology in Utah, a unique development is moving forward, seeking to produce 100 megawatts of energy without using water-based tools — when fully operational. 
Last week Millard County commissioners gave an enthusiastic nod to Rodatherm, a Canada-based company, to resume construction of a generation facility partially sitting on federally-managed land in Beaver and Millard counties, near FORGE, a laboratory sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy that has been working on breakthroughs in geothermal technology.

The main difference between this technology and that of FORGE is that Rodatherm doesn’t stimulate the fracture of reservoirs to create energy, like other enhanced geothermal systems, but essentially, uses a closed-loop system with a heat pump at depth to achieve the same effect, Curtis Cook, founder and president of Rodatherm Energy Corporation said.
“It is a method by which we efficiently and at very low cost, convert heat to power,” Cook said.
The company uses a fully-isolated fluid directly in a power-generating turbine, a system that’s 50% more efficient than water-based geothermal generation, according to a news release from the company. It also promises to be competitive in cost at early stages of the project, and to have a multiple-decade life span.
“Utah in general, is very favorable for geothermal given its high thermal gradients. What that practically means, it has much higher temperatures at shallower depth, so it is much more conducive for geothermal power generation,” Cook said. 
And, the area is “very well-studied” attracting not only FORGE but other geothermal competitors, he said.

After initially losing funding for the project, Rodatherm has found opportunities with investors that highlighted their desire to partner with entrepreneurs looking for decarbonization solutions, according to the release. Current state and federal initiatives favoring geothermal investment have also played a role in the comeback. 
“A year ago, it was very different in how geothermal was being assessed, so the economics were unclear,” Cook said. “Fast forward, now under the (‘big, beautiful bill’), and the new administration’s support for geothermal, the economics of the project now look very robust.”
Michael Dabbs, vice president of corporate development at Rodatherm, said in a presentation to the Millard County Commission that the company is drilling down two miles, then two more miles horizontally in a loop crossing Millard and Beaver counties. 
“We’re looking to drill on Jan. 15. We’re fully permitted. We’ve already done some construction out there a couple years ago, but our financing didn’t quite go through,” Dabbs told commissioners. “So now we have financing, and we’re hoping to start construction this month.”
A federal environmental review didn’t find a significant impact, according to a 2023 news release from the Bureau of Land Management. The company is planning to generate about 3.6 megawatts in the BLM portion of the site for its pilot project.

(Courtesy HBO)In an act reminiscent of Mamie Till’s profound gesture of defiance, Steven Davis’ mother carried a photo of her beaten son’s face with her as she searched for answers about what happened to him, with an HBO film crew shadowing her.
Davis’ brother took the photo at a hospital where Davis, a man incarcerated in Alabama’s prison system, died in 2019 after corrections officers beat him. Sandy Ray, his mother, said she’ll never get that image of his face out of her mind.
“As many pictures as I have of him being happy, laughing and stuff – that picture overrides all the good,” Ray says in “The Alabama Solution,” a documentary six years in the making that premiered Friday on HBO and at the Capri Theatre in Montgomery.

Ray’s pursuit of information and justice is one of several plot lines in the film.
For much of the 113-minute run time, those incarcerated inside Alabama prisons tell their own stories, using contraband cell phones to capture shocking footage: rat-infested cells, overcrowded, dirty facilities with roof leaks and no air conditioning, and pools of blood in rooms where guards allegedly beat prisoners. They turn the cameras on themselves to reveal severe facial injuries.
Charlotte Kaufman, co-director of the film, said using sources inside prisons was a less abstract way to provide audiences with information they could get elsewhere.
“What the footage allows is for you to see and experience all of the truths that have already been documented in lawsuits and investigations,” she said. “But there’s something different when you actually get to see it and to connect with the people who are living the reality inside.”
Beth Shelburne, a co-producer of the film and an Alabama journalist who has covered the state’s prisons since 2012, wrote a series called Blood Money for the Alabama Reflector earlier this year. It explores some of the topics in the film, including a sharp rise since 2015 in use-of-force incidents in Alabama prisons and the spending of millions of dollars in public money to defend accused officers and settle lawsuits.

A visual statement

The filmmakers’ investigation into Alabama’s prison system began in 2019, three years after the U.S. Department of Justice began investigating Alabama’s 13 prisons for men and a year before the DOJ filed a lawsuit based on its findings.
Blood Money: Alabama Department of Corrections pays to settle lawsuits alleging excessive force

“The Alabama Solution” portrays circumstances the Justice Department details in its finding letters. The department found reasonable cause that conditions — including use of force — violate prisoners’ Eighth and 14th Amendment rights and amount to cruel and unusual punishment.
“It’s a continuous cycle of violence, a lack of accountability, and without us being able to inform society about what’s happening, these incidents are not even reported,” said Melvin Ray, an inmate and prison-reform activist in the film.
Robert Earl Council, an activist incarcerated in Alabama prisons who also goes by Kinetik Justice, calls the situation a humanitarian crisis. “We have record numbers of people leaving out of here in body bags,” he said in the film. “As long as ADOC [Alabama Department of Corrections] has control of the narrative, this society is never gonna understand or believe what’s really going on inside.”
ADOC and the Alabama Attorney General’s Office deny that problems in the state’s prisons represent systemic constitutional violations, and the state has spent millions fighting the Justice Department’s lawsuit.
Kaufman said many of those who took risks to even participate in the documentary from prison found it important to share their faces as well as their voices.
“‘We want you to see all of us. We want you to see our entire story,’” Kaufman remembers Ray telling her when filmmakers asked if he would like to do a call without video. “It’s like, ‘Look, we’re still people. We’re still evolving. We’re still humans in here.’”
For more than a decade, a group of prisoners have been trying to tell their side of the story not only through cell phone videos but through legal actions. “The Alabama Solution” also documents those efforts.

Prisoner-led law classes

Halifax County is the name prisoners gave to a program that includes a self-taught law class. The Halifax County [North Carolina] Voters Movement in the 1960s organized nonviolent demonstrations advocating for Black voting rights, jury service and equal job opportunities. With the help of inmates who were Civil Rights Movement activists, incarcerated men started the Halifax County program to stand up for their rights inside prison.
“Halifax County brought a spark of hope, a spark of life,” Council says in the film, referring to the legal program. “Through our knowledge of the law, we were able to see more clearly things that were going on all around us that were not right.”
In the documentary, line drawings by a former inmate illustrate the group’s history and its work, which has involved filing numerous “pro se” lawsuits from inside prison. “Pro se,” the Latin term meaning “for oneself,” describes legal proceedings in which a person represents themselves, without a lawyer.
Halifax County participants say in film footage that ADOC responded to grievances and lawsuits prisoners filed by closing a prison law library and by retaliating against leaders of the group.
“That’s why these men are so brave to continue to believe in the power of journalism and the power of public knowledge,” Kaufman said. “As Melvin said to us, not in the film, but at one point, ‘I’m more afraid of what happens when they turn the cameras off.’”

Labor strike

The documentary also covers a 2022 work strike organized by people in prisons across the state. The strike gained media attention, but “The Alabama Solution” chronicles it in a different way — from the perspectives of the incarcerated, using videos they recorded at the time.
“What’s the absolute best way to beat the system where it’s going to hurt the most?” Ray asks in an organizing session the film documents. “You get them in the pocket. That hurts way more than hitting them in the mouth.”
Alabama prisons operated at 174% capacity in August, according to numbers published by ADOC. They operate with one-third of the necessary staff, according to statistics presented in the film, and depend on inmate labor to operate.
Data and information about Alabama’s prison system are interspersed on title cards throughout the film. One states that prisoners generate $450 million in goods and services for Alabama every year. Prisoners work both inside prisons and outside of them, for private companies.
“The state of Alabama continues to thrive on the bodies of Black, brown and poor white people,” Council says in the documentary. “The institution of slavery is real.”
Kaufman said people in prison are not only being asked to work practically for free but are being coerced into doing so.
“If you’re in a work-release camp and you decide that you don’t want to work, then you risk going back to one of the more maximum facility camps, where you might die or you might be placed in solitary confinement,” she said. “It’s beneficial for the companies because you have sort of a captive workforce that probably isn’t going to complain or isn’t going to put up a big fight about working conditions or working hours.”
Film footage during the strike shows prisoners talking about lack of food and unsanitary conditions, factors that led to the strike ending after three weeks.

Alabama’s solution? Build more prisons

The state’s main response to the ongoing DOJ lawsuit has been a plan to build more prisons. The film points out these new megaprisons, with an estimated price tag that has more than doubled from the 2021 projection of $1.3 billion, aren’t likely to affect overcrowding issues because they will replace existing prisons, leaving the number of beds unchanged.
Footage in the film shows Gov. Kay Ivey reiterating her support for using money from the state’s education fund to partially pay for the prisons.
The documentary also shows Ivey talking about an “Alabama Solution” to the state’s prison problems, invoking a local-control theme that has long been raised in the South, including during the Civil War and Civil Rights Movement, when the federal government or others outside the region try to address human-rights issues.
“It’s got to be an Alabama solution,” Ivey says in footage included in the film. “We cannot tolerate the alternative, which is having the DOJ take it over, turn folks loose. It’s our problem. We got to own it. We got to fix it.”

Database of deaths

While producers were working on the film, they watched the rate of deaths inside Alabama prisons double from 2019 numbers, Kaufman said. Alabama Appleseed, a criminal justice reform group, estimates that 1,322 people died in Alabama prisons between 2019 and 2024.
The film looks into deaths of inmates besides Steven Davis, including that of Davis’ cellmate, James Sales. He had agreed to talk with Davis’ mother after he got out of prison. But he died one month before he was to be released.
“Most of the coincidences I run into don’t turn out to be coincidences,” says civil rights attorney Hank Sherrod during a scene in the film in which he reviews Sales’ autopsy report. Sherrod represented Sandy Ray in a lawsuit over Davis’ death.
Filmmakers also released a database with names and public information about deaths inside Alabama prisons.
“We kept track of all of the deaths, and we’ve created a database that pulls from multiple sources of data — federal, state, autopsies — and is informed by various sources across the institutions to track each of those deaths and try to get as much information about what caused all of those deaths as possible,” Kaufman said.
Those who worked on the documentary plan to update the database on a regular basis, she said.

Conversation starter

“The Alabama Solution” received critical acclaim after a showing at the Sundance Film Festival in January. The Montgomery premiere is among about 60 community screenings that are scheduled nationwide. Half are set for Alabama.
Kaufman said when prisons are secretive and people don’t know what’s happening inside them, it’s easy to assume they’re fulfilling their purpose of correcting behavior and improving public safety.
She said audiences will see that Alabama is spending around a quarter of the general state fund budget on institutions that are not meeting those expectations.
“Our hope is, on a very high level, to start a meaningful conversation about what we’re spending our tax dollars on and have that conversation be informed by the full picture of the harm that these systems are causing and how short they’re falling in terms of achieving the intended vision,” Kaufman said. “We’re also hoping that the public will engage with this material, and if they are moved by it, they will let their lawmakers know, ‘This is something we care about.’”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Men-lining-up-at-Easterling-for-Oct-13-2025-story-1024x576.png,,,2025-10-13 09:01:57.723738

(Photo by Trevor Bexon/Getty Images)In June 2025, the Nevada Legislature passed A.B. 376, a bill that could fundamentally reshape Nevada’s property insurance system. Starting January 1, 2026, insurers will be permitted to exclude wildfire coverage from standard homeowners’ policies and offer it only as a separate, standalone product. As written, the legislation allows insurers to go even further by eliminating wildfire coverage entirely.
While the bill is intended to improve insurance availability in a high-risk environment, its provisions may leave many Nevada homeowners without essential protection. Some consumers may not realize that wildfire coverage is no longer included in their standard policies. Others may be unwilling or unable to pay for an additional policy. In the most extreme case, wildfire insurance could disappear from the market altogether, exposing thousands of homeowners to serious financial risk.
This legislative shift comes at a time when Nevada is facing increasing wildfire danger. Over the past four decades, wildfires have burned 18.5 percent of Nevada’s land, placing the state fifth in the nation for total land area affected. In 2018, the Martin and Sugarloaf Fires together scorched nearly one million acres. The Pinehaven Fire in Reno in 2020 destroyed five homes and damaged another dozen while residents of more than 1,300 homes were evacuated. In 2024, the Davis Fire in Washoe County destroyed 14 structures and forced the evacuation of 20,000 residents.
Meanwhile, housing development has rapidly expanded into high-risk areas. Between 1990 and 2020, the number of homes built in Nevada’s wildland-urban interface (WUI) grew by 208 percent. This was the fastest rate of WUI development in the country. As a result, many more Nevada homes are now located in areas where wildfire risk is highest. These structures add significant fuel to potential fires, making suppression more difficult and damage more extensive. Areas like the Reno-Tahoe region have seen especially fast growth, as Reno has quickly become the fourth-largest city in Nevada despite being located in one of the state’s highest-risk wildfire regions.
At the same time, the insurance market has become more volatile. Since 2018, Nevada homeowners have seen insurance rates rise by 21 percent. According to the 2025 Insurance Market Report by the Nevada Division of Insurance, in 2023, wildfire concerns led insurers to decline renewal for 481 homeowner policies, which represented an 82 percent increase from the previous year. That same year, total home insurance policy cancellations and non-renewals in Nevada surged to nearly 158,000, while insurer denials of coverage due to wildfire risk more than doubled.
In this context, lawmakers sought to keep insurers in the market by relaxing regulations. A.B. 376 allows companies to test new products outside of existing rules, accelerates approval of rate increases, and gives them more flexibility to manage wildfire risk. However, the bill does little to protect consumers or ensure transparency. Without adequate requirements for notification, many homeowners may not realize that their policies no longer include wildfire protection. Others may struggle to afford a separate policy, leaving them uninsured just as fire threats continue to rise.
Homeowners can take steps to reduce their vulnerability. It is essential to review insurance documents regularly and confirm directly with insurers whether wildfire coverage is included. Reducing ignition risks around homes by clearing vegetation and debris, especially within five feet of structures, is critically important. Strengthening homes with fire-resistant materials such as non-combustible roofing and upgraded vents can also make a meaningful difference. Neighborhood participation in the Firewise USA® recognition program is another way to improve community safety and may improve a home’s insurability. Firewise USA provides a voluntary process for neighbors to work together to reduce wildfire risks to their homes and surroundings. 
As Nevada confronts the growing threat of wildfire, the stakes for homeowners have never been higher. Insurance is a critical lifeline when disaster strikes. While lawmakers seek to address instability in the insurance market, effective solutions must balance the needs of the industry with consumer protections. Consumers must be educated about what is at stake. Without an understanding and stronger safeguards, too many Nevadans may find themselves underinsured or entirely unprotected when the next wildfire arrives. Moving forward, the state must ensure not only access to insurance, but access to coverage that protects the homes and lives most at risk.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1229661053-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-13 09:01:57.723738

“This simply should not be happening in our capital city or anywhere in our state for that matter,” Ivey said in the wake of the shooting.
And she’s right. It shouldn’t. But I’m not convinced that’s what they’re actually concerned about.
Power seems to be the real point of this “public safety” outrage.
What Montgomery’s critics seem to be angling for is a takeover of law enforcement in the city, akin to a proposal last year to have the governor and attorney general take over the Birmingham and Montgomery police departments. Under that proposal, a white Republican from Wilcox County and a white Republican from Marshall County would have controlled law enforcement in two majority-Black cities, denying Black residents input in their own governance.
It’s certainly not about public safety. No public safety plan is serious without a major effort to reduce the number of guns in the state. And so far, Ivey and her finger-wagging colleagues haven’t given us one.
Alabama has a gun problem. Our firearm death rates are some of the highest in the nation. In 2023, we lost 25.6 lives per 100,000 to gunfire, the fourth-highest rate in the United States. Over the last decade, Alabama has never ranker lower than fifth in the nation for gun violence.
You are more likely to lose your life to a bullet in Alabama than in New York, which is four times bigger than Alabama but has fewer gun deaths each year.
The difference is obvious. Gun laws.
New York state requires permits to carry concealed weapons. Dealers must run background checks at sale. Guns must be safely stored. New York forbids people from openly carrying guns in public. People can petition the courts to take the firearms of those who may be a threat to themselves or others.
Alabama does none of those things.
The Legislature has twice killed a bill from Rep. Barbara Drummond, D-Mobile, to effectively require gun-owning parents to keep their weapons stored. Lawmakers approved a state Glock switch ban this year, which is good, but it was less a new regulation than a way to speed arrests. Legislators also passed a bill allowing people to voluntarily surrender their guns if they think they will be a threat to other people, a law that will likely be ineffective.
And none of those proposals can undo the decades of permissive gun policies that make horrors like the one in Montgomery possible. Even as they scolded Montgomery leadership over violence, Alabama’s leaders ignored their role in fomenting it.
“Unfortunately, I still feel the need for the state to further intervene in Montgomery and to have an even greater role in leading public safety efforts in our capital city,” said Ivey, who signed a law in 2022 making it much easier for people who don’t need guns to get them, and bragged about it.
“Though the blame lies with those who carelessly pulled the triggers, I continue to be troubled by the city leadership’s stubborn refusal to acknowledge they have a serious problem,” said Attorney General Steve Marshall, who was conspicuously silent in 2022 as Ivey and the Legislature got rid of concealed carry permit requirements, over the objections of sheriffs.
“Local leaders must be willing to lead in order to stop the crime and violence,” said Lt. Gov. Will Ainsworth, who cheered on the flood of guns in 2022, saying that permit requirements aimed at protecting safety were just a “gun tax.”
Neither Ivey nor Marshall nor Ainsworth pulled the triggers in Montgomery. But deadly weapons end up in the wrong hands because Alabama’s Republican leaders think gun ownership is a right above all others, even the right to live without violence.
And whether you agree with Montgomery’s crime-fighting strategies, it’s clear the city takes the issue seriously. Montgomery has boosted the local police budget by more than 26% over the last six years. Mayor Steven Reed noted that Alabama’s lax gun laws are a major driver of the violence. He also noted that when the city last year tried to impose a minor gun restriction to address the carnage, state leaders forced Montgomery to repeal it.
You get used to hypocrisy in Alabama politics. The senator, allegedly concerned about free speech on college campuses, wants people at universities expressing views contrary to his to be jailed. The governor who thinks the world of Alabama’s workforce thinks a whole lot less of it the instant workers show the slightest lack of deference to their self-evidently benevolent employers.
That’s what you get with a state government built to thwart the public will, not reflect it. Power matters far more than truth or consistency.
And if you want to use Montgomery’s tragedy to extend your power over Black Alabamians, then a flood of gun violence that owes a lot to your recklessness is rather useful.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Memorial-for-Oct-13-2025-column-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-13 09:01:57.723738

But what will it take to tap into this substantial energy source,"Located in Lordsburg, Lightning Dock is the only utility scale geothermal power plant in New Mexico. (BLM New Mexico via FlickrA recent report estimates that New Mexico has the potential to produce substantial power from its geothermal resources.
But what will it take to tap into this substantial energy source underneath our feet that could reduce emissions and curb climate change?
Geothermal energy comes from deep within the Earth’s crust, where heat is produced by both the decay of radioactive minerals and molten rock.
This heat is key for generating electricity – usually from tapping into a hot water aquifer – which can directly heat buildings or spin a turbine’s rotor. This process emits no pollutants and, unlike solar or wind, can be available around the clock.
This type of electricity production has actually been around for a long time – getting its start over 100 years ago in areas experiencing significant subsurface geologic activity.
Tom Solomon is the head facilitator of the New Mexico Geothermal Working Group, a slew of volunteers who explore geothermal and ways that it can be brought to the state.
“New Mexico is number six in the nation in terms of its resource potential for geothermal,” Solomon said.
He’s referencing a report by Project InnerSpace, the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology and the Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources, which singled out Santa Fe, Rio Arriba, Sandoval and Taos counties as the best candidates for geothermal exploration.
It found that New Mexico has the potential to produce 163 gigawatts of geothermal power. Just one gigawatt can power roughly 750,000 homes on average.
That power could then be sold to other states or attract private investment opportunities, such as data centers.
Solomon says New Mexico is just starting to explore this massive source of energy.
Right now, there’s only one utility-scale geothermal power plant, located in Lordsburg, and state officials in June announced a deal between Meta and XGS Energy to significantly boost the state’s geothermal output.
“The really exciting possibility is what’s called ‘advanced geothermal,’ or ‘hot dry rock geothermal,’ which New Mexico has in abundance, primarily because of the Rio Grande rift,” Solomon said.
Bisecting the state, the Rio Grande rift is a place where the earth’s crust and mantle have been stretched, thinned, and fractured by tectonic forces – pushing heat closer to the surface.
“Meaning you don’t have to drill as deep to access that really hot rock, which is the source of potential geothermal,” Solomon said.

Similar to oil and gas fracking, this method works by drilling wells into the Earth’s surface and using high-pressure water to fracture hot basement rock, creating a piping-hot reservoir.
Then, engineers can inject cold water into a well, which circulates and heats up through the hot, fractured rock, and then is brought up to the surface for use.
Wells must also be drilled very deep into the earth’s surface – sometimes 15,000 feet down. For context, the highest natural point in New Mexico is Wheeler Peak, at just over 13,000 feet.
Despite the promise of geothermal energy production, it’s been a difficult pitch to policymakers and utilities because it’s both expensive up front and the technology is rapidly evolving.
In fact, advancements in hot, dry rock geothermal are so new, experts are closely following the construction of a first-of-its-kind utility-scale project by Fervo Energy in Utah.
There, engineers are hoping to put out 100 megawatts of electricity next year, adding 400 more by the end of 2028.
The excitement surrounding advanced geothermal system research lies in the potential to drill both vertically and horizontally, allowing wells to have more contact with a geothermal source.
By doing so, power plants can be placed pretty much everywhere, and can access more heat from the same depth. Another plus: it can utilize readily available expertise from the oil and gas industry – who use a similar technique to tap fossil fuel reservoirs.
Regardless of the type of geothermal energy, the fast pace of the industry is creating some red-hot buzz in the Land of Enchantment.
“Geothermal energy will fit like a hand in a glove in New Mexico,” said Rebecca “Puck” Stair, director of the energy conservation and management division within the Energy Minerals and Natural Resources Department (EMNRD).
Stair estimates that around 40% of the state’s electricity is sourced from renewables, putting it well ahead of its self-imposed clean energy goals. To her, geothermal could fill in the remaining 60%.
“There is a possibility that we could switch our entire electric grid over to clean power fueled by solar, wind and geothermal, and the math is penciling for that,” Stair said. “And, at the same time, still be pumping oil and gas out of the Permian [Basin] for use elsewhere in other states.”
New Mexico heavily relies on the revenue generated from the oil and gas industry to prop up its economy, and is slowly diversifying its portfolio by shoring up permanent funds and investing in other industries.
In 2024, Stair and her team were tasked by the legislature to develop rules and regulations for geothermal permitting and a separate grant and loan program to help fund projects.
Her department is still drafting those rules, but Stair said these initiatives are a huge investment, because geothermal will only be possible with private-public partnerships to construct those expensive geothermal power plants.
“I think the ball is in our court right now, and we’re hopefully carrying it hard and fast,” Stair added.
Still, she hopes the state will fund mapping options to pinpoint the ideal places for geothermal, who owns that land, and nearest transmission lines to evaluate infrastructure needs.
At the Roundhouse, lawmakers continue to be enthusiastic about geothermal and say they’re open to funding more research.
“It’s a pretty win-win deal,” said State Sen. Pat Woods (R-Grady). “We’ve got the oil and gas industry that is very efficient at digging these deep wells.”
A longtime supporter of the oil and gas industry, Woods thinks that together, fossil fuels and geothermal could bring new rural jobs, but he’s not totally convinced it’s a silver bullet.
“I think it’s a hell of an idea, but it’s a ways out,” Woods said.
Woods is clear: he doesn’t want to replace oil and gas anytime soon. For now it keeps crucial dollars flowing to his constituents in the far northeastern stretch of the state.
However, state analysts predict that fossil fuel production will start to decline sharply in the near future – maybe by 2035 – raising real questions about New Mexico’s plan to tackle the energy and economic gaps it will leave behind.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/lordsburg-copy-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-13 07:56:55.906182

(Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Work began last month to restore the prominent memorial honoring Thurgood Marshall, the first Black justice on the U.S. Supreme Court, but stopped almost as quickly as scaffolding was erected behind the bronze status of the history-making Maryland native.
Work on the memorial, which was taken down for construction around Lawyers Mall and then when cracks were discovered in its columns, was stopped after contractors identified problems with the reconstruction plan, said a spokesperson for the Department of General Services, which is overseeing the project.
“The contractor has mobilized and begun reconstruction efforts,” Brandon Stoneburg, the DGS spokesperson, said in an email. “However, during the initial phase, issues were identified with the securing compounds specified and purchased for the columns. As a result, the state and its team made the decision to temporarily halt work. We are actively working with our partners and material suppliers to resolve these issues.”
Stoneburg did not elaborate on the issues. The department did not make staff available for an interview. Costs of the work were not immediately disclosed.
“Once resolved, and assuming favorable weather conditions, construction could be completed within a month,” Stoneburg said in his email.
“Our goal is to ensure that Lawyers Mall is fully restored and ready to welcome advocates, legislators, and the public to its full potential,” he wrote.
The monument has had its share of difficulties in recent years.

Designed by Maryland artist Toby Mendez, the memorial was dedicated in 1996. The 8-foot bronze statue of Marshall stands as the focal point.
Mendez incorporated the facade of the Department of Legislative Services Building — once the site of what was then the Maryland Court of Appeals where Marshall, as an attorney, argued the landmark Murray v. Pearson case that opened the University of Maryland School of Law to Black students.
Between the building and Marshall stood six columns. The placement gave the appearance of Marshall on the steps of a courthouse.
The memorial includes bronze statues seated on benches in front of Marshall.
On one bench, a statue of Donald Gaines Murray, the law student represented by Marshall. On another, the figures of two children represented in the Brown v. The Board of Education of Topeka case. Marshall was the lead attorney in the landmark Supreme Court case cleared the way for desegregation of schools nationally by overturning the 19th century Plessy v. Ferguson case, which had established the “separate but equal” doctrine.
Atop the columns, an entablature inscribed “Equal Justice Under Law.” Important dates in Marshall’s career lie in a circle in the mall at Marshall’s feet.
The memorial was disassembled and removed in 2018 to allow for work on utilities running under the plaza.
Some pieces — the columns and entablatures — were stored, according to Chris Kintzel, director of the Maryland Commission on Artistic Property.
Oversight of the monument is complicated.
The commission is responsible for the statue of Marshall as well as the figures seated on the benches. The columns, entablature and other features fall under the purview of the Department of General Services.
“It’s not exactly like art hanging on a wall,” Kintzel said
The bronze statue of Marshall was moved temporarily to the entrance of the Robert C. Murphy Court of Appeals Building.
The statue and memorial returned to Lawyers Mall in late 2020, and were rededicated in 2021. But the next year,the columns and entablature had to be taken down after it was discovered they had been damaged.

“The colonnade which serves as the backdrop to the Thurgood Marshall statue in Lawyers Mall was disassembled when concerns over certain cracks were deemed to be a potential safety risk,” Stoneburg wrote.
“While evaluating the disassembled columns to identify a potential cause for the cracks, a decision was made not to reconstruct the monument while the adjacent Legislative Services Building was being constructed to prevent potential damage from heavy equipment vibrations,” he wrote. “During this time, additional maintenance updates to help preserve this important landmark for years to come were also identified and are currently being implemented.”
One of those changes involves improving the engravings of the court cases and significant cases that are part of the paved area around the statue. Some of those engravings have suffered from time, weather, and foot traffic.
“They really wanted to emphasize the engravings and his cases with a deeper cut — trying to make it more legible,” Kintzel said. “Over time, it became hard to read some of the lettering of the cases. They began to fade over time. With this new deeper cut, the new methodology, the lettering should remain legible for a much, much, much, much longer time.”
The cracks in the columns — some significant — were discovered at the same time workers were demolishing and replacing the adjacent Department of Legislative Services Building.
The exact cause of the damage to the columns is not clear. But experts noted at the time that the monument was not designed to be disassembled and reassembled.
“Although studies were conducted to determine the cause of the original structural failure, the findings were not fully conclusive,” Stoneburg said. “The State continues to work collaboratively with the original construction team to refine the reconstruction details and ensure long-term success.”
Not all of the pieces of the reconstructed memorial will be original.
“As part of the reconstruction, the original columns — deemed too damaged to reuse — have been replaced,” Stoneburg wrote. “The new columns, fabricated to match the original profile, were designed as two-piece units instead of the original three-piece configuration. However, the original entablatures that sit atop each set of three columns have been preserved and will be reinstalled as part of the reconstruction.”
Also new to the mall: a modern Department of Legislative Services Building. The new 144,000 square-foot building was officially opened in January.
“The expanded Lawyers Mall has definitely created a much greater access to the plaza, it’s more secure…and when the columns and everything are back in place, it will then help reframe the idea that here is a space where history took place, and it will be better framed now that the new building is complete and the new bases and columns will be in place,” Kintzel said.
State officials worked with Mendez, the artist, to ensure his vision of the memorial remained.
“They consulted with Tony on the new building, so that it would still look proportional and look like it was originally intended,” Kintzel said. “So, it still has the idea of it being in the spot where, where the old Court of Appeals was, where Marshall would have been when he argued his landmark cases.”

Hoover, chair of the Maryland Public Service Commission. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)The company behind the proposed Piedmont power line is pushing Maryland regulators to evaluate the project more quickly than planned, arguing that delays will jeopardize the power grid.
The company, PSEG Renewable Transmission, is opposing a procedural schedule issued by the Maryland Public Service Commission, which plans to review the project until at least February 2027.
PSEG argues that the commission’s schedule will make it impossible to reach a deadline for placing the power line in service by June 2027, which was set by the operator of the region’s electric grid, PJM Interconnection.
“PJM set the in-service date to prevent specific impending reliability violations,” wrote PSEG attorney J. Joseph Curran, III, in a letter to the commission. “Unless these violations are addressed, PJM has determined that overall system reliability in the PJM region — including in Maryland — could be compromised, and the PJM region could be exposed to widespread and extreme conditions, such as system collapse and blackouts.”
The commission, by contrast, has expressed confidence that the electric grid will remain well-managed while it deliberates about the transmission line.
US marshals won’t be used for protection during Maryland power line surveys — for now

In his letter to the commission, Curran also requested that it establish a target date to issue a final order on the Maryland Piedmont Reliability Project, as the power line project is known. An end date would help the company more efficiently coordinate with other state and federal permitting agencies, plan construction activities, and negotiate with landowners, he wrote.
But in a statement Friday, Tori Leonard, a spokesperson for the commission, said it is “unlikely” to place an end cap on the proceedings by setting a target date for a final order. The commission’s schedule ends in February 2027 with a deadline for the parties to submit their final briefs.
The commission will ultimately decide whether the controversial power line receives a “Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity,” authorizing its construction. But the process has already been mired in delays, largely because of intense pushback from landowners in the line’s path, and other community members and elected officials in the impacted jurisdictions.
Because of landowner denials, PSEG had to go to court to get a federal district judge to order temporary access to hundreds of properties for environmental surveys, which it will need in order to get a final ruling from the commission.
Those surveys are well underway, though landowners have appealed. On Thursday, the company filed suit against a third round of defiant landowners, requesting access to 64 additional parcels.
By comparison, in his Oct. 7 letter, Curran said the company has obtained voluntary access agreements for 52 parcels along the proposed route.
The proposed line would stretch 67 miles through largely rural areas in Baltimore, Carroll and Frederick counties, connecting a power substation near the Pennsylvania line with a substation in Frederick County.
The project was commissioned by grid operator PJM alongside a host of other projects meant to relieve problems in a strained grid, caused in part by the rise of energy-intensive data centers and expected retirements of fossil fuel generating stations.
In a statement shortly after the Maryland Commission issued its schedule for the Piedmont line, PJM spokesman Jeff Shields said that “PJM has identified extensive, severe, and widespread reliability violations that PJM expects to occur as soon as June 2027 if these projects are not built on the prescribed schedule, leaving the entire system more exposed to reliability risks, including power outages.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Shields noted that Maryland will be “additionally challenged to meet local demand from local sources” given the planned retirements of the Brandon Shores and Wagner power plants, which are currently operating solely because of “must run” agreements with the grid.
In its news release announcing the scheduling order on Sept. 11, the commission highlighted that PSEG submitted its application for the certification in late December 2024, as opposed to fall 2024 as planned.
In his letter to the commission, Curran pushed back, arguing that the New-Jersey based power company only submitted in December because it decided to conduct additional public hearings in November 2024.
In requesting an end date for the proceedings, Curran argued that it would help expedite the permits that PSEG would likely only be able to obtain after a decision on the certificate of public convenience, including from the Army Corps of Engineers, the Maryland Department of the Environment, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the impacted counties.
“Having a final order date in the procedural schedule is necessary so that the Company can have plans in place to ensure the Project goes into service as soon as practical to meet critical reliability needs,” Curran wrote.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/DSC_0282-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-13 07:56:55.906182

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)States are doing what they generally do during a federal government shutdown: Continuing to operate programs serving some of the neediest people.
That means schools are still serving federally subsidized meals and states are distributing funding for the federal food stamp program. For now.
If the shutdown drags on and federal dollars run out, states can only keep programs going for so long. States may choose to pay for some services themselves so residents keep their benefits.
But while it’s traditionally been the practice to reimburse states for federal costs once the shutdown ends, state leaders have new worries about whether that will be the case this time. The Trump administration’s record of pulling funding and targeting Democratic-led states has some officials worried about what comes after the shutdown.
Many states already struggled to balance their own budgets this year. And some fear going without federal reimbursement for shutdown costs could force states to make painful cuts to their own budget priorities.
Nevada State Treasurer Zach Conine, a Democrat, said the administration has not made good on its word to states in recent months — freezing some congressionally approved funding and cutting already awarded grants. So it’s likewise unclear whether the federal government will follow previous practice and reimburse states for covering shutdown costs of crucial federal programs such as food assistance.
“I think everything is a risk with this administration…. We in the states are kind of left holding the bag yet again as the federal government tries to sort out what it wants to be when it grows up,” Conine told Stateline.

Nevada entered the shutdown with more than $1.2 billion in reserves. Last week, Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo’s office said in a statement that state funds would be adequate to cover “a short period of time with minimal disruption to services.”
But the governor’s office said a shutdown of more than 30 days would cause more significant challenges for the state.
Lombardo’s office did not respond to Stateline’s questions. But on Oct. 1, when the shutdown started, it released a three-page document on the shutdown, saying it expected the federal government to reimburse states once the budget stalemate is resolved.
“As D.C. works through its issues, our administration will continue to support Nevadans in any way we can throughout this unnecessary federal government shutdown,” Lombardo said in the statement.
While mandatory programs such as Medicaid and Social Security continue to send funds to beneficiaries during the shutdown, funding for other safety net programs such as food assistance are more uncertain. The federal government told states there were enough funds for the food stamp program to cover October benefits, though the special Women, Infants and Children food program may run out of money sooner.
By furloughing workers and halting federal spending, the shutdown could cost the national economy $15 billion per week, President Donald Trump’s economic advisers estimated.
The White House says a prolonged shutdown will affect the economies of every state by reducing employment, federal benefits and consumer spending. White House estimates say this could cost Michigan $361 million per week in lost economic output, for example, while Florida could lose $911 million each week.
‘Fend for themselves’
Some federal services are shuttered during a shutdown: The Environmental Protection Agency has ceased many research, permitting and enforcement efforts, and official jobs data is no longer being released. Federal funds for other programs, including food assistance, are expected to last through the end of the month. But states can elect to spend their own funds on these programs, which were previously authorized by Congress and state legislatures.










There’s no way, really at this point, to sort of assess with any level of confidence what’s going to happen when you also have these massive layoffs that were going on pre-shutdown. There’s just a real sense from states and localities — and I think rightly so — that that kind of reliability of the federal government is now in question.


– Lisa Parshall, professor of political science at Daemen University in New York


Before the shutdown, states were stockpiling reserve funding. The National Association of State Budget Officers reported most state budgets this year maintained or increased rainy day funds. At the same time, state and local governments are borrowing record amounts: As much as $600 billion in municipal bonds is projected to be issued by the end of 2025.
“So states and localities are kind of getting the message they really need to fend for themselves much more than they ever had,” said William Glasgall, public finance adviser at the Volcker Alliance, a nonprofit that works to support public sector workers.
Since January, the Trump administration has stripped states and cities of billions of dollars that Congress approved for education, infrastructure and energy projects. Glasgall said that record leaves states with legitimate concerns about getting repaid for their shutdown-related expenses — a prospect that would likely spark even more lawsuits from Democratic-led states.
“They’ve already, before the shutdown, started rolling back federal funding, and I don’t see any reason why they would stop now,” he said. “The recissions that have been announced are pretty harsh, and it’s money we’re expecting and not getting.”
The last shutdown, which lasted five weeks during Trump’s first term, delayed billions in federal spending and reduced gross domestic product — the value of all goods and services produced — by $11 billion, the Congressional Budget Office estimated in 2019. Experts say states were repaid for costs they incurred providing federal services during that shutdown.
In Minnesota, State Budget Director Ahna Minge said staff have been studying previous shutdowns. But at a news conference with Democratic Gov. Tim Walz last week, she characterized this shutdown as “unpredictable.”
“The current federal administration may not follow the historic playbook,” she said.
Walz said farmers would be among the first hit as the federal Farm Service Agency has ceased operations in the middle of the state’s harvest season. Among other duties, that agency works on disaster assistance and processes loans during harvest to protect farmers against commodity price fluctuations.

Minge said Minnesota officials think programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program [SNAP] and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for Women, Infants and Children have enough existing federal funds to operate through October. But she said the state budget cannot backfill all the commitments made by federal programs.
“What we know is that the longer a shutdown lasts, the greater the impact to state programs and services,” she said.
Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont, a Democrat, has pledged to use state dollars to keep WIC afloat if needed, the Associated Press reported. And  Colorado lawmakers set aside $7.5 million just before the shutdown to keep WIC running.
Already under strain
In Maryland, the shutdown is compounding economic instability from Trump’s ongoing efforts to shrink the number of federal employees, agencies and spending.
With more than 260,000 federal employees, Maryland’s economy relies heavily on the federal workforce. The Trump administration has said it may deny back pay to hundreds of thousands of furloughed federal workers, despite a law he signed in 2019 guaranteeing such back pay.
Chief Deputy Comptroller Andrew Schaufele told lawmakers on Sept. 30 that a shutdown could cost the state $700,000 per day in lost tax revenue.
Democratic Gov. Wes Moore pledged to continue funding some federal programs, but said the state would not tap into its Rainy Day fund to do so.
“We’re going to continually evaluate how long we can go,” he said at a news conference.
As for getting repaid, Moore spokesperson David Turner told Stateline that the state had received no indication that the federal government would deviate from past practice, “but we are monitoring closely.”
This fiscal uncertainty hits states as they are already struggling to respond to the strain of federal agency layoffs and cuts in the major tax and spending law Trump signed this summer. That law slashed billions in social service funding and created costly new bureaucratic burdens for states, which administer Medicaid and food assistance programs.
Moore vows to keep some federal programs in Maryland operating – for now

“There’s no way, really at this point, to sort of assess with any level of confidence what’s going to happen when you also have these massive layoffs that were going on pre-shutdown,” said Lisa Parshall, a professor of political science at Daemen University in New York. “There’s just a real sense from states and localities — and I think rightly so — that that kind of reliability of the federal government is now in question.”
It may not be a question of whether states are reimbursed for their shutdown expenses, but which states are reimbursed, Parshall said. The Trump administration has publicly targeted funding of liberal-led states and cities over policy disagreements, raising the possibility it could do something similar with the shutdown.
“Whether it’s a good thing or a bad thing, you know, you could argue,” she said. “But it’s definitely a thing that seems to be adding to this level of uncertainty — this shutdown feels different.”
In California, officials just closed a nearly $12 billion shortfall when negotiating the budget that was approved in June. The budget deficit is expected to grow to more than $17 billion next year, said H.D. Palmer, spokesperson for the State of California Department of Finance, which advises the governor and state agencies on budget issues.
“There isn’t a long-term, open-ended line of credit available if this drags out,” he said of the federal government shutdown.
The depth of reserve funds available varies by federally funded program, he said. CalFresh, California’s name for its SNAP program, has enough funds to cover food stamp benefits for this month, but anything beyond that is uncertain.
“If the duration of this is in the matter of days, it will be an inconvenience, but should not pose a massive problem,” he said. “However, if it does drag out for an extended period of time, then clearly it’s going to be a problem.”

(Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)State auditors have referred their investigation of credit card use by a worker at the State Department of Assessments and Taxation to the criminal division of the attorney general’s office, after finding questionable purchases by the employee and lax oversight by department managers.
The Office of Legislative Audits report released last week said its investigation was sparked by a tip to its fraud, waste and abuse hotline concerning questionable corporate purchasing card (CPC) purchases involving an individual employed at DAT’s headquarters during the period from May 2019 through August 2024.
It found that not only had the employee made questionable purchases, including questionable CPC payments made on behalf of two senior management employees at SDAT, but that there were problems with the agency’s internal controls “that enabled questionable activity to do undetected.”
The report said that 37 SDAT employees had corporate cards, and they made 7,649 purchases worth $2.3 milion from fiscal 2022 through fiscal 2025. The targeted individual was responsible for 530 payments during that time, totaling $118,000.
The employee submitted 230 payments, worth $41,400, without receipts and another 16, worth $1,400, that came with illegible receipts. When documentation was available, the agency, and later the auditors, found some questionable expenses like $376 paid to one vendor for items that included dog food and steaks; and $190 for items that included “tumblers, nail polish and other personal items.”

	The audit also found that the employee paid about $6,800 for two rental properties in Ocean City in August 2022, apparently at the direction of two management employees attending a conference there from Aug. 17-20. But the report noted that the rentals were for the entire week of Aug. 13-20 and were made in each case for two adults and two children. It said SDAT could not provide justification for the extra nights, or show whether costs of the vacation property were consitent with standard hotel costs for the resort at that time of year.
SDAT said it identified the questionable expenses by the employee while preparing for a 2024 audit by the comptroller’s office, and after identifying $300 in questionable payments — for personal utilities, gas and phone bills — it fired the employee in August 2024. The agency said it stopped its investigation then, since $300 is the threshold for terminating a worker.
But auditors said SDAT could not provide documentation of that investigation, and that when it fired the employee it failed to process it as a “termination with prejudice” — meaning that the employee would have been eligible to be rehired by another state agency.
Auditors said a search of state employment records showed that the person has not been hired by another state agency, and SDAT has since reprocessed the firing to reflect that it was done “with prejudice.”
Even though state law requires that agencies “immediately refer any instances of possible criminal or unethical conduct by an employee” to the attorney general’s office and to the governor’s chief legal counsel, SDAT did not do so, the auditors said. Nor did it seek to recover the questionable payments it uncovered.
In his reply, SDAT Director Bob Yeager agreed with all the findings of the audit and said his agency has taken steps to correct the problems identified in it, including referring the matter to the attorney general and reviewing all agency termination notices to make sure they were properly classified.
Yeager also said the agency has developed a training program for corporate card holders and required refreshers for current card holders, improved processes for approving purchases and reviewing purchase logs, and clarified the proper response when issues are found.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/IMG_5903-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-13 07:56:55.906182

A federal shutdown in Washington D.C. could hit some of Indiana's poorest who rely on government food benefits. (Photos by Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle and Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom) In the coming days, a food aid program that helps millions of mothers and young children will likely run out of money. States like Indiana must use their own dollars to keep funds flowing to families or let it lapse, a move that could cut benefits for the 157,000 Hoosiers who rely on the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, or WIC.
But the Indiana Department of Health declined to share specifics about how WIC would operate in the state, saying that “funds have been identified to keep WIC operating as normal for the foreseeable future.”
“IDOH continues to monitor the situation, and WIC is operating as normal,” said Greta Sanderson, the chief communications officer for the agency.
But advocates warn of the potential impacts to Hoosier mothers — including those who are pregnant — and children relying on government services like WIC if such funds ran out.

“It’s providing nutrition to a population where nutrition is critical for development,” said Emily Weikert Bryant, the executive director of Feeding Indiana’s Hungry. “… no matter what, our member food banks will continue to be there for communities and for our neighbors who are in need of food assistance.”
Bryant said other food benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, appeared to have steady funding in the coming weeks alongside WIC. However, SNAP is reportedly also running out of money even as the Trump administration explores using tariff revenue to fund WIC. 
In a preliminary estimate on the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s website, 156,752 Hoosiers received benefits from WIC in May 2025, the latest data available. Of those, more than half — 87,000, or 56% — were children while infants and mothers each made up 22% of Indiana’s total, or roughly 35,000. 
Between October 1, 2024 — the beginning of the federal fiscal year — and May, the federal government allotted nearly $80 million to Indiana’s WIC program, $24 million of which went to administrative costs. 
Some states are reportedly chipping in their own funds to keep the program running, including Mississippi, Colorado and Connecticut. Other states, like Washington, say they don’t have money available.
The program is one of thousands funded by the federal government, which has had its funding frozen since Oct. 1. Most government offices continue to function as normal during the partisan budget standoff, but cracks are beginning to show — and Hoosiers will be dealing with the consequences. 
Already, a key federal jobs report was delayed and fewer staff are at the state’s only federal park in northern Indiana, though it remains open through the shutdown.
 Other programs impacted by the shutdown

Indiana is slightly more dependent on federal funding than the average state, with 40% of the state’s budget coming from Washington, D.C. compared to 36% for all 50 states, according to Pew. The nonprofit notes that federal programs have rolling deadlines for funding to expire, meaning that some programs don’t need additional appropriations for a few more years.
Gov. Mike Braun’s Deputy Chief of Staff for Communications Molly Craft spoke generally about the federal shutdown’s impact on state services last week: “We are in good shape.”
“Let’s see how long this goes. We have smart people leading different agencies — we’ll work out with them the details to try to make sure Hoosiers are served well, despite whatever may happen in D.C.,” she said.
Indiana education officials said the immediate effects of a federal government shutdown on K-12 schools will likely be limited — at least at first.
Courtney Bearsch, a spokesperson for the Indiana Department of Education, said the department “is continuing the normal operations of programs funded by federal grants,” given that a majority of IDOE’s federal funding is already authorized for the 2025-2026 school year. 
“If the shutdown lasts for an extended period,” Bearsch added, “IDOE will re-evaluate the situation, along with our state-level partners.”
Because most federal grants to schools were awarded over the summer, the U.S. Department of Education expects minimal disruption to day-to-day district operations. 
Federal officials said Title I funds, which support schools with higher concentrations of students in poverty, and funding for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act will continue to flow. But the agency will halt new grantmaking, pause its advisory and regulatory activities, and stop investigations into alleged civil rights violations during the shutdown.
The federal education department will also continue processing Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) forms, which colleges and universities rely on to assemble financial aid packages.
Still, the pause in government services could be felt sooner in certain Indiana districts that rely on Impact Aid — a federal program that supports school systems on or near federal lands, such as military installations, which can’t be taxed locally. Those payments are made directly to schools, not through the state, and typically arrive later in the calendar year. 
Bearsch said IDOE is not notified when schools receive Impact Aid payments, but noted that last year’s funding went out in December.
The National Association of Federally Impacted Schools warned on Friday that “districts are facing an immediate and significant cash-flow crisis” if payments are delayed.
Six Indiana school districts received Impact Aid in fiscal year 2025, totaling more than $900,000, according to NAFIS.
Those included: Bartholomew Consolidated School Corp., $261,886; Bloomfield School District, $23,669; Loogootee School Corporation, $303452; Madison Consolidated Schools, $81,796; Perry Central Community School Corp., $167,208; and South Ripley Community School Corp., $76,487. 
It’s not clear how much funding districts are expecting for the current fiscal year.
 Federal employees

But, as Pew notes, shutdowns also halt government services such as rulemaking, grantmaking and technical assistance — impacting the employees tasked with reviewing Medicaid waivers, transportation planning and environmental grants.
At least 600,000 federal employees could be suspended, depending on each agency’s definition of who qualifies as essential. Indiana has roughly 25,000 federal employees within its borders.

Many employees are expected to work without pay, including the country’s troops, immigration agents and air traffic controllers. Friday’s paycheck — which covers the pay period from Sept. 24 to Oct. 7 — was the first partial payment since the shutdown began.
And the Trump administration started permanent layoffs on Friday, including:

Commerce: 315 employees
Education: 466 employees
Energy: 187 employees
Health and Human Services: between 1,100 and 1,200 employees
Housing and Urban Development: 442 employees
Homeland Security: 176 employees
Treasury: 1,446 employees

Staffing issues at several airports have caused delays nationwide, from California’s Hollywood Burbank Airport to Newark, New Jersey. Some airports with zero flight controllers for several hours cancelled flights.
Though the Indianapolis airport hasn’t yet had a delay reported to the National Airspace System due to its staff, any change in any part of the greater system has a ripple effect. 
In past shutdowns, employees who are furloughed were guaranteed backpay — but a draft White House memo shared with Axios floats the possibility that the Trump administration may reverse that precedent. 
Bryant, with Feeding Indiana’s Hungry, pointed to increasing levels of food insecurity, saying that the greater Feeding America network — whose donation page explicitly mentions supporting families during the shutdown — anticipates increased demand in the coming weeks.
“This shutdown creates uncertainty for millions of civilian and military federal employees and employees of federal contractors,” said Bryant. “All of whom are at risk of paycheck disruptions and maybe not getting back pay.
“Many of these hard-working folks are just one paycheck away from needing support from their local food bank or pantry.”
Families in need can download the Community Compass app to locate food resources, including free groceries or meals, stores participating in SNAP, WIC clinics and more.

,New Jersey Monitor,2025-10-13 11:14:34+00:00,New Jersey Monitor,Columbus is now an Italian American myth. Let’s name the day after someone else.,Jen A. Miller,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/10/13/rename-columbus-day/,Writer Jen A. Miller says she's proud of her Italian American heritage — but thinks Columbus Day in name has to go.,"Writer Jen A. Miller says Italian Americans can celebrate their heritage without honoring Christopher Columbus. (Photo by David Dee Delgado/Getty Images)While living in Italy this summer, I made a trip to Genoa to see Christopher Columbus’s birthplace. It’s a small building, and wasn’t very crowded. The guide spent more time describing a structure in the courtyard, which to him held more historical significance than the house itself. 
This might surprise Americans, given the brouhaha about Columbus Day here. But like pasta primavera and the Feast of the Seven Fishes, Columbus Day is largely an Italian American invention. We should rename the holiday to reflect that it’s about us, and not some long-dead guy whose “discovery” led to the deaths of millions.
Yes, of course, Italians recognize that Christopher Columbus crossed the Atlantic Ocean in 1492. In Italy, it’s called Giornata nazionale di Cristoforo Colombo, but it’s not a national holiday and certainly doesn’t carry the same pomp and circumstance as the dozens of saint-dedicated feast days celebrated at different levels of intensity, depending on where you are in the country.
Andy Kim likens Donald Trump’s shutdown behavior to ‘mafia tactics’

Columbus Day celebrations started here in 1792, and were pushed as a way to combat then-intense anti-Italian and anti-Catholic sentiments. Most of this work was done at the state level until 1891, when 11 Italian immigrants were lynched in New Orleans. In 1892, the 400th anniversary of Columbus’s first voyage, President Benjamin Harris made Columbus Day a one-time, national thing. 
The big movement to make it a national holiday came in 1934 at the behest of the Knights of Columbus, which led to a proclamation by Franklin D. Roosevelt — but not a national holiday (this was the same president who oversaw the internment of nearly 2,000 Italians during World War II). The federal holiday designation came in 1971, set for the second Monday in October.
By this time, Columbus Day was less about a man whose four voyages to the Americas led to the genocide of indigenous peoples and the creation of the trans-Atlantic slave trade, and more about a mythologized figure who served as a backdrop for recognizing the accomplishments and contributions Italian immigrants have made to this country. 
The current pro-Columbus Day push is part of a larger backlash against any gains made since 2020 by people who are not straight, white Christian males. In April, President Trump said that Columbus Day needs to make a “major comeback” despite it never going away, and last week signed a proclamation to reclaim the explorer’s legacy. Republican gubernatorial candidate Jack Ciattarelli has pledged to “save” Columbus Day — which, again, hasn’t disappeared in a cloud of rainbow-colored woke smoke. 
This summer, the “Columbus Heritage Coalition,” a group who says its mission is to support the celebration of Columbus Day and has a map on its website targeting communities that have renamed the holiday, used an old tweet by New York City mayoral hopeful Zohran Mamdani opposing the presence of a Columbus statue to try to hurt his election chances by saying he’s “exclusionary” for wanting to take it down.
Mamdani is Muslim and was born in Uganda, so it’s not a surprise that he’d become a target of people using Columbus as a conduit to point at someone else and scream they are now the “other.” It’s part of a long tradition of those who were once persecuted becoming the aggressor. 
It’s not like I’m not proud to be Italian. I’ve been learning the language for more than three years, and on this past summer trip, I rented a Fiat 500 and drove up a steep mountain on tiny, twisty roads to meet the branch of my Italian family who still live there. I didn’t do these things for my health. I did so because where I come from is important to me.
But Columbus Day in name has to go. If we want to keep the holiday but rename it after someone with questionable values, that’s fine. Pick an actual Italian American. Let’s rename the second Monday in October Frank Sinatra Day. At least he won an Oscar.

(Photo by New Jersey Monitor)[2025 governor's race Voter Guide: The race for NJ governor]A déjà vu campaign in South Jersey is shaping up to be one of the most contested and closely watched Statehouse races this year, with four candidates who sought Assembly seats in 2023 in the 8th Legislative District facing off again.
Democrat Andrea Katz pulled off a surprise upset two years ago when she ousted Republican incumbent Brandon Umba. Now, Umba is back on the campaign trail in an effort to retake the seat. Katz’s 2023 running mate, Anthony Angelozzi, is running alongside her again, while incumbent Assemblyman Michael Torrissi Jr. is Umba’s running mate once more.
Ben Dworkin, director of the Rowan Institute for Public Policy and Citizenship at Rowan University, called the race a true toss-up and “a wonderful expression of democracy.”
“You have qualified candidates running against each other with different visions out there, trying to engage as many voters as they can. Yay. Kudos to America, because that’s what it should be,” Dworkin said. “You have other places where as long as you win the primary, you can go to sleep and just wake up after Election Day and you’ve won. This is not one of those districts. This is a very tough district.”
While incumbents typically win and name recognition boosts a candidate’s odds, all four candidates in this race have the advantage of name recognition, while three of the four have Assembly experience, Dworkin noted. This is one of only two districts statewide represented in the Assembly by one Republican and one Democrat.

The 2023 race was so close on election night — with less than 500 votes between Torrissi, the top vote-getter, and Umba, in last place — that Katz appeared to concede the next day. It took a week before election officials instead confirmed her as a winner, after all vote-by-mail and provisional ballots were counted.
Dworkin predicts this year’s race will boil down to who knocks on the most doors and engages the most voters face-to-face in this sprawling district — among the largest statewide by area — that covers parts of Burlington and Atlantic counties.
“I think it’s going to turn significantly on individual relationships: How many voters have met these candidates, shaken their hand, had them knock on their doors, made a personal call, not just from campaign staff, but from the candidates themselves?” Dworkin said.
All four candidates said such personal interactions have been their chief campaign strategy.
Angelozzi said he’s knocked on 6,300 doors and aims to hit 8,000 to 9,000 by Election Day on Nov. 4. Katz said she’s been similarly busy.
“My knees are aching. I’m exhausted. There’s muscles in my legs that I didn’t know existed,” Katz said. “But that’s how we do it. We just talk to people, and then we trust that the voters are going to do what’s best for them.”
A battle against colon cancer kept Torrissi largely sidelined during the 2023 campaign, but this year is different, he said.
“I am completely healthy now. I’ve never been working so hard,” he said.
All 80 Assembly seats are on the ballot this year.
 Affordability and utilities

All four candidates say affordability is their top issue.

Torrissi, who owns a trucking company, pointed to New Jersey’s highest-in-the-nation property taxes, crippling health care costs, and skyrocketing utility bills as complaints he has heard from voters.
“Everybody seems to be wanting to leave New Jersey,” Torrissi said. “I don’t want to have to leave New Jersey. I want to stay here. And it really comes down to affordability.”
Immigration and supporting police also are top concerns for Torrissi, who said he does not support the sanctuary policies of Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy’s administration. He said his parents were Italian immigrants and that he’s a “pro-immigrant person.”
“I represent everybody. But we want to make sure they’re here legally, and we don’t have criminals,” Torrissi said. “Do it the right way.”
Umba, who is township administrator in Southampton Township, said he wants to fix the school funding formula and make the state “energy independent” by expanding natural gas and renewable energy sources rather than relying on out-of-state energy sources.
“That’s what’s driving up costs,” Umba said.
Angelozzi teaches 10th grade history at Hammonton High School, heads the Hammonton Education Association, and works as a contract negotiator and union organizer for the New Jersey Education Association. He said New Jersey residents are “desperate for relief.”
“Voters want answers. They don’t know why the bills are going up. I feel it myself. My wife and I are schoolteachers. We don’t get paid in the summer. So when those monster electric bills come to our house, it is a stressor,” Angelozzi said.
Angelozzi and Katz, a stay-at-home mother of three and former president of the Chesterfield Democrats, also list as priorities education, school funding, reproductive rights, and “results-oriented” policymaking instead of the bitter partisanship and division that now dominate politics.
“People just want us to go to work and make their lives better. They want the simple things in life. They see the chaos in government, and what I hear is: ‘Can you go and be my voice and be a sane person in government for me?’ Yes, yes I can,” Katz said.

 Turnout key

The district has shifted slightly to the right since its Assembly seats were last on the ballot, with the GOP picking up about 2,000 voters and the Democrats losing about 25 since 2023.

Torrissi and Umba hope the change will help them secure a win. Angelozzi remains undaunted. He pointed out that Katz toppled Umba in 2023 even though Republicans have largely dominated legislative races in this district. Unaffiliated voters also outnumber those registered to either major party in the district, with almost 64,630 unaffiliated voters in June compared to nearly 58,300 registered Republicans and 57,500 registered Democrats, state data shows.
Turnout is typically low in off-year elections, with just 27% of New Jersey voters casting ballots in 2023, compared to 65% in 2024’s presidential election, state data shows. But the governor’s race could juice turnout next month if the 2021 gubernatorial race is any indication — 40% of registered voters cast ballots in that election, data shows.
Voters now have three ways to vote — in person on Election Day, in person at early voting locations beginning Oct. 25, and by mail, which is already underway, Dworkin noted.
“Right now, on both sides in this campaign, they are chasing down ballots,” Dworkin said. “But I can’t tell you who’s going to win this thing.”

I am likely correct that no person reading this has seen smallpox.
It has been nearly 90 years since the last isolated report of a Vermonter ill with this dreaded, disfiguring, often life-stealing disease.
After the 1928 Vermont epidemic, spurred by lax vaccination, the Vermont Department of Health instituted a highly successful immunization campaign. 1929 ended with a near-eradication of smallpox in our state.
Most Americans in the 1920s received plenty of exercise and sleep. Alcohol was prohibited. Meals were whole food, fresh and devoid of microplastics — yet life expectancy averaged around 50 years. Illness and death from smallpox, influenza, pneumonias, measles, diphtheria, whooping cough, tuberculosis, strep and other infectious diseases were common. Today, many of these infections are prevented or mitigated due to medical advances, foremost immunizations. However, many pathogens are on opportunistic standby.

On May 14, 1796, Dr. Edward Jenner successfully administered his new smallpox vaccine. The vaccine arrived in the U.S. in 1800. Despite concerns at the time that people would turn into cows, vaccine delivery increased and smallpox outbreaks decreased. By 1949, smallpox no longer existed on American soil.
To reiterate: There has been zero, zilch, nada, none, no smallpox in the U.S. since 1949 and was declared eradicated from the planet in 1980. The nearly 100% effective vaccine had saved countless lives.
Vermonters on the whole embrace immunization. While there has been a recent decline in immunization rates, we are not yet seeing an impact on public health. There is a fine line, however. For example, the established goal for community protection against measles is a 95% immunization rate. Vermont is presently at about 94%. Measles is so contagious that only a few percentage points below the 95% immunization goal sacrifices our protections.
Families share that they are struggling, attempting to discern accurate information from a recent deluge of misinformation, disinformation and flagrant malinformation about vaccines. Health care professionals take our responsibilities to heart and will not be dispirited by the recent environment of fabricated anti-vaccination propaganda. On the contrary, we are more dedicated than ever to empathetically maintain our trusting relationships with patients as we help address immunization questions.
In a conversation with Merideth Plumpton, the Immunization Program Manager with the Vermont Department of Health, she spoke about her concern for families that are at loss when it comes to finding accurate vaccine information. Still, she reminds me that it’s amazing to live in a state that follows science. We have a history of health commissioners who always put science first; we have a governor who is willing to say that vaccines “are the best way to prevent serious illness.”
Dr. Anna McCloy, a Rutland pediatrician, shares, “What I love is when patients are honest about their biggest vaccine fears. I can work with them.” She has noticed a misguided trend: the belief that “whole foods, healthy habits and loving our kids will protect them.” History demonstrates that these behaviors are important, but they are incomplete when it comes to infectious pathogens. Immunizations are an important part of healthy living.
Immunization recommendations and schedules will change from time to time. As with all vaccines, recommendations to administer or to discontinue immunization are based upon epidemiology and scientific evidence measuring the benefits of vaccination against any potential risks. This is the standard that has successfully held true. Independent, apolitical, trained, experienced, logical, methodical scientific review and expertise assessing vaccine benefits relative to any potential risk must always dictate recommendations.
There is no conspiracy. There are no big-dollar incentives. There is no deep-state attempt to control and manipulate genes. There is no activation of autism. There is no human-to-cow metamorphosis. Immunizations are a gift of successful medical achievements contributing to a healthy life, family and community. Immunizations are health care of value.
Please immunize. Save lives.

Minnesota has reported 20 measles cases this year, with all recent cases in unvaccinated people.
Measles is a highly contagious illness that, before the 1960s, nearly all children contracted and from which tens of thousands were hospitalized every year. Thanks to decades of widespread vaccination, it was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, though the number of measles cases in 2025 — the highest in three decades — is now threatening that status.

Minnesota has reported 20 measles cases this year, with all recent cases in unvaccinated people.
Measles is a highly contagious illness that, before the 1960s, nearly all children contracted and from which tens of thousands were hospitalized every year. Thanks to decades of widespread vaccination, it was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, though the number of measles cases in 2025 — the highest in three decades — is now threatening that status.
That’s partly because more families are getting their kids out of routine vaccinations, including for measles.

(Photo by Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)The Trump administration cuts to government programs and downsizing of the civil service workforce have altered the public sector substantially. This has been well reported, but the consequences of these changes on the private, not-for-profit sector, has not received as much attention.
The federal bureaucracy is an easy target for its critics. It has no coherent master plan. It began with core duties of any country (defense, diplomacy, treasury) but then had manage the geographic growth of the country. Then industrialization often erased state borders and federalized many policy areas. At key moments, constituency groups like veterans, labor groups, agricultural interests etc. requested government attention and regulatory agencies developed from periodic market failures, new technologies, or to quash discrimination. The resulting crazy quilt of agencies and departments is easy for critics to question.
Further, just as the federal government grew, significant corruption reforms led to civil servants being hired based on their expertise rather than political allegiance. The resulting neutral competence is beneficial, but does collide with principles that presidential elections provide clear mandates to govern. We both want neutral experts to craft policies but also want elections to matter, which has frustrated presidents long before President Trump, but it’s particularly vivid in this polarized age. 
Consequently, the strange structure, tension between neutral competence and electoral responsiveness, and a particularly American resistance to centralized government has formed a conventional wisdom that the federal bureaucracy is way too big and clumsy. 
International comparison
Interestingly, the US public sector is far smaller than other democracies. Federal, state, and local public sector employment in the US is around 25% lower than most European democracies, which matches the level that American government spending is lower than European Union countries’ public expenditures, despite far greater spending on defense in the US. Our taxes as a percentage of our overall economy are 25% to 40% lower than these countries as well.  
Europeans are perfectly comfortable with a larger governing role in society. European Social Democrats and even European Conservative parties dominate elections and both believe that taxing and redistributing wealth bring social equality and stability. Despite our polarized rhetoric, both American parties prefer lower taxes and spending relative to European mainstream parties. 
While American skepticism toward big government is deeply baked into our political culture, that does not mean Americans support dramatic cuts in practice. The Pew Research Center finds that a majority of Americans favor most federal agencies and, except for ICE, Justice, and the IRS, all named agencies have more people favoring them than not. Further, most public policy research indicates that the federal government performs well on efficiency relative to other democracies. And before DOGE, the Government Accountability Office has long closely audited government agencies and publicly reported inefficiencies, waste, and policies that didn’t measure up.   
Whether the DOGE cuts are legal or responsible is being decided by courts and Congress. One ironic, less-discussed problem that may emerge from such sudden cuts is there potential harm for the not-for-profit sectors that Americans prefer tackling social issues like health, human services, education, and the arts. 
Again, a comparative historical look is helpful. Most European countries fully democratized after the socialist movement, which simultaneously pressed for equality and democracy and created the welfare state systems. American democracy began well before the pressures of the industrial revolution and Americans, who had the right to vote across classes even if not gender and race, rejected socialism and large-scale welfare state. So American beliefs of individualism and limited government meant that civil society — churches and not-for-profits — tackled thorny social problems more so and prior to the federal government. 
Leveraging the non-for-profit arena
When the US government did later step into these social issues due the scale of hardship from the depression and social inequalities, its policies leveraged not-for-profit partners rather than directly handling issues with government agency employees. This grant-based approach is a very American approach of strengthening civil society addressing policy problems rather than a government takeover. 
The Urban Institute reports the level of these federal grants. About 27% of health, human services, education and arts-based not-for-profit groups receive federal grants, which is almost identical to the 26% of such Indiana not-for-profits that receive these federal grants. Two-thirds of these groups receive less than 25% of their funds from federal, state, or local grants, so the majority of their funding comes from the private sector.
It’s healthy to debate how much government should be spending, but during the debate it should be considered whether sudden cuts to what is around 25% of not-for-profit budgets could permanently damage groups doing social work. For instance, the network of groups that carries out humanitarian aid around the work that received USAID grants have been devastated by the USAID grant cuts. If major humanitarian issues develop — on top of those existing crushing ones — the private sector groups may be defunct or lack the capacity to address those problems.
Moving forward, it’s vital to consider the balance of public funds to the private sector. There’s consensus among Americans that civil society should be dealing with social issues. Consequently, ensuring that civil society groups thrive must be considered in the pace and level of cuts.

Tim Walz receives the flu and COVID-19 vaccination, Oct. 8, 2025. (Photo courtesy of the Office of Gov. Walz)Gov. Tim Walz and his wife, Gwen Walz, received COVID and flu vaccines last week, and the CDC released new guidance that anyone over 6 months can receive the COVID-19 shot after consulting with a pharmacist or health care provider.
“Our message today is simple: Minnesotans will continue to have the freedom to receive their vaccines,” Walz said.
New guidance last week from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on the COVID shot has cleared up weeks of confusion on who can receive the vaccine, following restrictions from the Food and Drug Administration in August.
The CDC now says that the vaccine can be administered to anyone over 6 months after consultation with a health care provider. The recommendation is a “shared clinical decision-making” guideline — a step down from “routine” recommendations for vaccines — which emphasizes vaccination as an option instead of outright encouraging it, wrote Jason L. Schwartz in a Yale School of Public Health publication.
The Minnesota Department of Health already released a standing order — following an executive order from Walz — to ensure that Minnesotans 3 years old and up can get a COVID shot regardless of federal recommendations.
In other words, Minnesotans’ right to receive the COVID vaccine is protected on both the state and federal level now.


As for whether your insurance will cover the shot, the new CDC guideline is still considered an official recommendation, and most insurance plans’ coverage is linked to CDC recommendations. As such, the COVID vaccine will be covered “through all payment mechanisms,” according to a CDC release last week.
AHIP, the trade group representing health insurers, said in a September statement in advance of the CDC recommendation that their member insurance companies would continue covering COVID and flu shots for free until the end of 2026.
MDH said in a statement that that the vaccine will be covered by insurance “in most cases.”
“I would love for our insurance plans to come out and be very clear with their members about the coverage for our COVID vaccines,” said MDH Commissioner Brooke Cunningham. Minnesota does not require state-regulated insurers to cover the COVID vaccine, unlike in 13 states, according to health policy research organization KFF.
“We always recommend [talking] to your doctor to call up your insurance plan to make sure you’re not caught with a bill,” Cunningham said. “But my understanding is they are paying for it.”

This could mean reduced benefits or increased payments by the employers and employees who fund the program, which lets Washingtonians take paid time off work for serious health issues or to care for a family member or a new child. 
The program’s actuary says paid family and medical leave could face a more than $350 million deficit in 2029. 
The state sets a premium rate annually for how much employers and employees need to pay into the program. This year, 0.92% of Washington workers’ paychecks go toward it. Next year, that’s projected to increase to 1.13%, though the rate will be finalized at the end of this month.
The problem is that state law caps premiums for the paid leave program at 1.2%. The state is projected to reach that cap in 2027 and stay there. That plateau means the program likely won’t be able to keep up with rising claims for benefits and increased payments as wages grow.
The program has been steadily growing since its launch in 2020. From July 1, 2024, to June 30, over 320,000 applications were submitted for paid leave, up 15% from the previous year, according to a report this month. Over 240,000 Washingtonians received more than $2 billion in total benefits, a year-over-year increase of about $300 million.
And legislation approved this year extending job protections for those who use this paid leave is likely to encourage even more people to use it.
“This plan is too popular not to be better funded,” said Sen. Steve Conway, D-Tacoma. 
The program already has periodic deficits as it falls behind in paying out claims before receiving premium payments each quarter. But the problem a few years down the road would be a sustained deficit, resulting in not enough money to dole out benefits, without legislators backfilling funding. 
In 2023, faced with a program already more popular than expected, lawmakers infused $200 million from the general fund into the paid leave account. The money provided a cushion and allowed the state to temporarily lower its premium rate.
Another funding boost like this is unlikely anytime soon as the state grapples with deep budget challenges.
Officials are also frustrated about how the rate for premiums has to be set each year under state law. The current formula looks backward, using the past as its main baseline for calculating future needs. Late last year, an audit found this contributed to the program’s potential long-term insolvency.
The Employment Security Department prefers an “actuarial approach” that is more forward-looking. States with similar initiatives take this approach to setting tax rates, and this is akin to how contributions are calculated for Washington’s workers’ compensation system. Last year’s audit recommended shifting to this method. 
A bill in the Legislature looked to make this change this year. Senate Bill 5292, spearheaded by Conway, passed the state Senate nearly unanimously before stalling in the House.
Changing the approach to calculating premiums wouldn’t secure the program’s financial future. The 1.2% cap on premiums would remain.
After Conway’s bill passed the Senate, lawmakers in the state House tried to shoehorn in an increase to the premium rate to 2% by 2033 in an attempt to address the looming deficit. The legislation died in the House, likely due to that change, Conway said. But the measure can be revived in the next legislative session, beginning in January.
Sen. Curtis King, R-Yakima, opposes raising the cap on premiums. It’s asking a lot of workers while the state is also now taxing wages to fund Washington’s long-term care program, which started collections in 2023, said King, the top Republican on the Senate Labor and Commerce Committee. He added that this affects lower-income workers more. 
He instead would like to see the conversation focus on cutting back the number of weeks of paid leave people are eligible for, or restricting the events that qualify for eligibility. 
“We got to start looking at, well, just how generous is this program?” King said. “How much of this can we afford to do, and how much are people really willing to pay into a program that a lot of them will never use?”
Another idea floated has been raising what is called the “taxable wage base,” Conway said. Workers only pay taxes to support the program on earnings up to this amount, currently $176,100.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/baby-hand-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-13 07:56:55.906182

MOScholars, which provides private school vouchers, expanded this fall with an infusion of state funds (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent)State funding of private-school vouchers is primarily being used for students attending religious institutions, with nearly 98% of funding going toward Catholic, Christian, Jewish and Islamic schools.
This year, state lawmakers passed a budget that included a request from Gov. Mike Kehoe to supply the state-run K-12 scholarship program, MOScholars, with $50 million of general revenue. Previously, the impact to the state’s bottom line was indirect, with 100% tax-deductible donations fueling the program.
Donations are still part of MOScholars’ funding, but the state appropriation has more than doubled the number of scholarships available.
During the 2024-25 school year, MOScholars awarded $15.2 million in scholarships.
In August alone, the State Treasurer’s Office received invoices for scholarships totaling $15.6 million, according to documents obtained by The Independent under Missouri’s open records laws.
The invoice process is unique to the direct state funding of the program. The nonprofits that administer scholarships, called educational assistance organizations, were the sole keepers of scholarship funds. But now, the State Treasurer’s Office holds scholarship money derived from general revenue in an account previously only used for program marketing and administration.
The invoices contained data on which schools MOScholars students are attending and the scholarship amount.
Of the 2,329 scholarships awarded in August, only 59 went to students in nonreligious schools.
 

 
This number did not surprise Democratic lawmakers, who for years have warned that state revenue was going to be siphoned into religious schools.
“We are simply subsidizing, with tax dollars, parents who would already choose to send their kids to a private school,” state Sen. Maggie Nurrenbern, a Kansas City Democrat, told The Independent. “And now we are using public dollars to pay for schools that are not transparent whatsoever in choosing who to educate and who not.”
Some schools have been criticized for admission requirements that push a moral standard.
Christian Fellowship School in Columbia, which received scholarships for 63 MOScholars students in August, requires “at least one parent of enrolled students professes faith in Christ and agrees with the admission policies and the philosophy and doctrinal statements of the school,” according to its handbook. 
These statements include disapproval of homosexuality.
“The school reserves the right, within its sole discretion, to refuse admission of an applicant or to discontinue enrollment of a student,” the handbook continues.
With around 430 K-12 students enrolled at Christian Fellowship School, according to National Center for Educational Statistics survey data, MOScholars makes up a sizable portion of its funding. But it is not the only school with a large number of scholarship recipients.
Torah Prep School in St. Louis had 229 K-12 students during the 2023-24 school year. And in August, 197 MOScholars students received funding to attend the school. Torah Prep did not respond to a request for comment.
The high number of students attending religious schools with MOScholars funding is somewhat incidental, somewhat by design.
The MOScholars program allows its six educational assistance organizations to choose what scholarships they are willing to support. 
Religious organizations stepped into the role to help connect congregants with affiliated schools. Only two of the six educational assistance organizations partner with schools unaffiliated with religion.
The Catholic dioceses of Kansas City-St. Joseph and Springfield-Cape Girardeau run the educational assistance organization Bright Futures Fund, which administered nearly half of the scholarships awarded in August.
The educational assistance organization Agudath Israel of Missouri focuses on Jewish education, partnering with four Jewish day schools.
The organization’s director Hillel Anton told The Independent that students are attracted to the program for more than just religious reasons.
“(Parents’) first and foremost concern is where their child is going to be able to be in the best learning environment,” Anton said. “And you may have a faith-based school that is fantastic and is able to provide that.”
 

 
The demand for the program has long exceeded funding availability. Going into August, organizations had waitlists of students eligible for a scholarship but without funding secured.
Agudath Israel of Missouri couldn’t guarantee scholarships for all of the returning students, Anton said, until the state funding was official.
“Because a lot of the funding is done towards the end of the year… we had everyone on a wait list,” he said. “Because we didn’t know necessarily how much funding we were going to have, we weren’t awarding anyone (the funding).”
Because the program was previously powered by 100% tax-deductible donations, the majority of funds poured in around December. But families need the money months sooner, with tuition due at the start of the school year.
Some educational assistance organizations prefunded scholarships, dipping into their savings to front expenses in the fall. Others had schools that would accept students and wait for payment.
The funding from the state, though, has resolved the backlog and allowed organizations to give scholarships to everyone on their wait list.
“Everyone who qualified for a scholarship this year received one,” Ashlie Hand, Bright Futures Fund’s director of communications, told The Independent.
Bright Futures Fund nearly doubled the number of students it serves, from 1,050 to 1,909.
Agudath Israel of Missouri is growing, too. The new funding helped the organization expand from 175 scholarships last year to 277 this year.
Some expect the state funding to continue next year to support this year’s windfall of scholarships. State Treasurer Vivek Malek told The Independent in May that if donations fall short, he will request state funds to support the new students through graduation.

As we near the holiday season, you may be looking to treat yourself to those set of wheels you’ve been eyeing, or perhaps it’s time to purchase your loved one their dream car. In today’s financial climate, managing your vehicle costs efficiently is key, as it could help you save money and limit potential headaches down the road. Here are some helpful tips to finally make that purchase for your (or a loved one’s) dream vehicle this holiday season:

Set your holiday budget, and stick to it. There are a variety of different expenses that come with getting a car – the purchase cost, insurance, maintenance and fuel being a few of them. Knowing how much you can afford, especially if you plan to pay for it over time, is key to avoiding a car bill that stretches your finances. Look for access to different budgeting tools and tips that can help you save for your purchase.
Look for the best holiday deals. Like many other items, vehicles have a price cycle; the end of the year tends to be when you can find a better deal, as dealers may need to meet quotas or clear out inventory. Generally, make sure you are considering multiple vehicles and shopping around at several dealerships to get the best price. 
Test drive the vehicle to make sure it fits your needs. This is your time to see how the vehicle looks and feels, try out the interior systems and figure out if the vehicle fits your needs. Schedule test drive appointments to ensure the car you want is still available, ideally a few in the same day or week to keep your impressions fresh in your mind. It’s also helpful to simulate your daily driving conditions as much as possible, such as bringing any car seats or equipment you may have in your car daily. After your test drive, you can ask about the car’s warranty and fuel and maintenance requirements, as well as the possibility of getting an extended test drive or bringing the car to your own mechanic for a second opinion.
Determine whether you are financing or leasing. There are benefits of both a lease and a loan. With a loan, there is no milage limit and you are free to customize and change the car as you see fit. After completing your finance payments, you own it. Leases typically have lower upfront costs than loan payments, and at the end of the term you can return, purchase or trade the vehicle in. But keep in mind that most leases have a mileage limit, so it might not be the best option if you travel often.  
How to know if an electric vehicle is right for you. With so many major manufacturers building EVs, there are more options than ever before. However, cost, maintenance, range and charging logistics are all key factors to consider. For maintenance, EVs typically require less maintenance than traditional cars. EV batteries tend to be covered by 8-10 year warranties (outlasting the amount of time most people own their cars) but EV tires degrade faster due to the weight of the battery.  And just as gas prices vary, so do electricity costs – based on your location, your driving style and the size of your battery.

The median range of an EV with a fully charged battery is roughly 250 miles, but that number depends on the make and model as well as other factors like weather, traffic conditions and driving style. And when it comes to charging infrastructure, some cities and states may have more charging stations than others. Make sure to plan your trip ahead of time and map your route.  
Be sure to do your homework first before making that big purchase. There are many tools available that can help you plan for costs in addition to the vehicle loan or lease payments, such as sales taxes, registration fees, and insurance—which can vary depending on the car make, model and even the color. For instance, using a car payment calculator can help estimate your monthly car payment for different scenarios, by inputting the ballpark amount you’d like to finance along with some other basic info.

Mike Kehoe announced on May 27 that he will call a special legislative session to consider disaster relief, stadium funding and spending items (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).No, I do not want to go collect signatures. 
My friend asks. I rack my brain for excuses. Walking up to strangers does not come naturally to me. My kids must have a soccer game or birthday party or something that conflicts. 
They do not. I have no excuse. I go. 
Once I get out there, I‘m glad I did. I meet lots of people just as angry as I am about the gerrymander of Kansas City and eager to reverse it. People thank me for being there.
I remain extremely resentful that I need to do it. 
I’m collecting signatures to reverse the bill passed in the special session that redraws Missouri’s new maps to deprive Kansas City residents of their voting power, specifically, of their U.S. Representative of 20 years, Emanuel Cleaver.
If our legislators would embrace democracy, play by the rules and represent their constituents, I’d be hanging with my family instead of approaching strangers on the sidewalk with a clipboard.
Trump demanded that red states redistrict mid-decade to increase Republican chances of retaining control of the House. Trump constantly says how popular he is, but if he believed that, he wouldn’t need new maps.
Some Republican governors pushed back against Trump’s demands. 
Not ours. 
Gov. Mike Kehoe took his MAGA marching orders and called the legislature into a special session even though our legislature fought over and redrew our maps only two years ago. Kehoe did this even though Missouri is already extremely gerrymandered, with 40% of Missouri voters identifying as Democrats, but only two out of eight congressional seats represented by Democrats. The gerrymander is intended to make that one out of eight. 
They also passed a bill in the special session to make it impossible for Missourians to use the initiative petition process. 
It is astoundingly anti-democratic that the majority of Missouri legislators have dedicated themselves to thwarting the will of Missouri voters and getting around the Missouri constitution.
Missouri lawmakers pass gerrymandered congressional map, initiative petition limits

Sure, I’m grateful Missouri has the citizens’ initiative petition so that voters can enact policies with bipartisan support when the legislature refuses to. Yes, I’m grateful for the referendum process that allows voters to reject laws passed by the legislature. 
But it’s a bad way to make law.
We wouldn’t need to use these burdensome, expensive processes if Missouri legislators didn’t treat Missouri voters like an enemy to be defeated.
It’s absurd that we have 40 pages of marijuana regulations in our state constitution. The legislature should have decriminalized marijuana via statute, enacting a policy favored by a majority of Missourians, but leaving legislators with flexibility to amend it as needed. Instead, advocates for policy changes increasingly feel they have to do everything by constitutional amendment because our legislature will immediately overturn any statute enacted by voters.
The paid sick leave ballot initiative, approved by 57% of Missouri voters after advocates gathered thousands of signatures to get it on the ballot, was only a statute. So the legislature trashed that, no problem. 
Even a constitutional amendment isn’t enough. As soon as Missourians decriminalized abortion via Amendment 3, the legislature immediately sought to reverse it. They halted all the legislature’s business at the end of session to put a deliberately misleading measure to re-ban abortion on the 2026 ballot (The amendment to re-ban abortion will also be called Amendment 3, for ultimate voter confusion).
This is not how democracy is supposed to work. Our representatives should represent us. All of us. Even those of us who are Democrats or independents or Republicans who support abortion decriminalization or paid sick leave. Voters are supposed to pick their representatives rather than politicians picking their voters. 
But Missouri Republicans are all in on Trump’s goal of dominating the opposition by whatever means necessary — including unconstitutional means. They are rejecting the fundamental premise of our democratic system that representatives of different populations must negotiate what the laws should be that govern all of us.
I saw Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin on a panel last year. She favorably contrasted the work that women in the legislature were able to do across the aisle to the extremism of some of her fellow Republicans. 
O’Laughlin has since gone all in for extremism. She abandoned any interest she once claimed to have in working for all Missourians when she shepherded the special session bills to deprive Kansas City area Missourians of their representation and gut all Missourians’ constitutional right to the initiative petition.
O’Laughlin, who presides over a Republican supermajority, made a claim about her other colleagues in an attempt to defend the gerrymander that is both laughable and shockingly disingenuous: “The map and the initiative petition reform measures will strike a huge blow to progressives and their efforts to turn Missouri into California.” 
Again, Missouri voters are 40% Democrats, with 25% representation in Congress. O’Laughlin’s allegation that anyone is trying to turn Missouri into California puts her at the goofiness level of the Missouri Freedom Caucus members she once criticized. But somehow she now has no problem lying about her colleagues across the aisle in defense of an unconstitutional bill intended to get Democratic representation down to 12.5%. On Trump’s orders. 
Gov. Kehoe readily abandoned his constitutional obligations when Trump said jump. The Missouri constitution says that redistricting happens every 10 years, after the federal census. Kehoe says, “We’ll let the courts decide that.”
Here’s the thing: Running a state is not supposed to be a game of “what can I get away with?” 
Kehoe swore an oath to uphold the constitution of Missouri. He shouldn’t be signing a mid-decade map openly designed to disenfranchise targeted Missourians. The job of the governor is to work in the interest of Missourians, not to light Missouri tax dollars afire with a special session and the inevitable lawsuits that will follow, to demonstrate fealty to Donald Trump.
The gerrymander is unconstitutional and I don’t expect it can survive court review. However, because I believe there are few things in life more important than living in a functioning democracy, I won’t be taking any chances.

Federal fallout

	
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and
whether to make up the difference.
Read the latest > 


More than $130 million in Wisconsin clean energy-related projects are at risk as the Trump administration moves to cut up to $24 billion in projects originally approved by the Biden administration.
The projects are on a list that covers three groups of cuts proposed in May, on Oct. 2 and this past week. The online news outlet Semafor reported the third set of proposed cuts, which alone totals $12 billion, on Tuesday, Oct. 7, and published a link to a list that covers all three groups.
“However, it’s not clear whether, or when, the full list of cancellations will be enacted, or if President Donald Trump is instead looking to use them as leverage in negotiations over the [federal government] shutdown,” Semafor reported.
The Wisconsin grants on the list are a mix of projects that help boost energy efficiency, including supporting the expansion of energy storage battery systems. One potential casualty is more than $1 million to prepare young people to enter apprenticeships in the skilled trades.
Clean energy holds the promise of addressing air pollution and climate change as well as revitalizing the state’s industrial base, said John Imes, director of the Wisconsin Environmental Initiative (WEI), a nonprofit that advocates policies benefiting the environment and the economy.
“These are all win-win that all of us want regardless of our political affiliation,” Imes told the Wisconsin Examiner. “This is all bottom-line stuff.”
Rolling back projects that enhance cleaner and more efficient use of energy will likely increase the cost of energy, Imes said.
“It means higher electric bills, higher energy bills, fewer choices and lost jobs,” he said. “We’re going to lose momentum.”
Battery power and rural grid upgrade
The two largest Wisconsin projects on the Department of Energy list of targets involve one company, Alliant Energy. They account for more than half of the Wisconsin funds targeted for cancellation.
The projects are being undertaken by Alliant’s Wisconsin Power & Light unit. They include a $50 million grant for upgrading the rural electrical grid and $30 million for a power storage system using a technology based on carbon dioxide this is to be built near Portage, Wisconsin.

“We understand the Administration and Department of Energy (DOE) are working through their budgets and have notified some businesses of changes to grant announcements,” said Cindy Tomlinson, Alliant senior manager for communications, in an email message last week.
“At this time, we have not been made aware of any changes to the announced DOE grants for our Alliant Energy projects,” Tomlinson said. “We are optimistic the value and viability of these projects is clear and that they will remain fully funded. These projects deliver economic and customer benefits.”
The electrical grid upgrade project received a conditional commitment from the energy department in December, but a final award agreement hasn’t been executed, Tomlinson said, and no federal funds have been received or spent.
The federal grants accounted for about one-third of the total planned investment for each project. If the grid upgrade grant is canceled, the project is still expected to go forward, Tomlinson said, “however at a slower, more gradual pace than the fast, concentrated fashion outlined in our grant application.”
Other potentially affected grants include $28.7 million for Johnson Controls, based in the Milwaukee suburb of Glendale, to support the company in its expansion of heat pump manufacturing.
The grant’s total value was $33 million at the time it was awarded to the company. According to USAspending.gov, a federal site that tracks the status of federal outlays, the business has received $4.4 million of the total.
Johnson Controls announced the grant in November 2023, part of an investment to scale up heat pump manufacturing at plants in Texas, Kansas and Pennsylvania and increase production by 200%, the company said at the time.
The company did not respond to inquiries Thursday and Friday by email and by telephone about the status of the grant or its planned heat pump manufacturing expansion.
Energy efficiency and innovation
Another Wisconsin recipient with grants on the list that are slated for elimination is Slipstream, a Madison-based nonprofit that provides consulting services on energy efficiency and innovation.
“We’re trying to make our energy systems more efficient and better so everybody’s paying less for energy,” said Scott Hackel, Slipstream’s vice president for research.
Hackel said Slipstream is working with other organizations on the list of targeted projects, and some of those organizations have been notified of grant terminations.
Slipstream also has two direct grants on the list, but has not received any notification that those grants are being terminated, Hackel said.
Slipstream had been awarded $5.2 million for work on equipping buildings with technology that enables them to automatically manage their power demand — reducing the building’s electrical load when demand on the grid is high and amping up the load when broader demand eases.
The organization is in the middle of a project implementing demand management technology in a group of buildings. The information gained from that test could be used to develop incentive programs for building owners to adopt that kind of technology, Hackel said.
If that gets cut off before it’s finished, other buildings in Wisconsin “would not have this example to look to,” he said.
A second grant awarded to the organization, $4 million, is to be used to train inspectors, building designers and others in how to effectively comply with and make the best use of building codes, particularly energy codes.
“Everything we’re doing is trying to make buildings and homes more affordable to live in with lower utility bills,” Hackel said. “If we’re not able to do that, that’s also a cost to people in Wisconsin.”
Two Universities of Wisconsin grants, one for $10 million and the other for $2.9 million, are on the list. Both involve projects to test technology innovations, according to the federal grant information documents.  
‘Electric city’ upgrades and a job-training program
A grant for the city of Kaukauna, Wisconsin, to install battery storage and make related electrical grid upgrades is also on the list. The original grant totaled $3 million, and so far $59,362 has been paid out, according to USAspending.gov, leaving $2.95 million that could be canceled.

The storage system is to bolster Kaukauna’s hydroelectric power generation operation, which dates to 1913 and led to the community’s adoption of “Electric City” as its nickname.
“Collateral damage from the Trump administration’s remarkably poor governance record continues to collect, this time in Kaukauna,” said Outagamie County Executive Tom Nelson. “I can’t think of something more insulting than making the electric grid of a place known as ‘Electric City’ less safe or efficient.”
Also on the list is the Wisconsin Regional Training Partnership, a Milwaukee nonprofit that provides training and certification to prepare people to enter apprenticeships in the skilled trades. WRTP was awarded a $1.5 million grant for training in skills related to transportation electrification. So far $112,470 has been paid out. 
Dan Bukiewicz, head of the Milwaukee Building Trades Council and co-chair of the WRTP board of directors, said that the board hasn’t been notified that its grant might be at risk of being taken away by the Trump administration.
“I won’t say we’re surprised,” however, Bukiewicz said. “They’re just trying to roll back a lot of the green energy and infrastructure [investments]. … It’s trying to make time stand still, and it just won’t if the United States is going to compete globally.”
WRTP students typically come from underserved communities and are the most in need, Bukiewicz said. The program’s training emphasizes job safety, introduces students to the construction industry, equips them with basic skills that an apprenticeship will build on, and acquaints them with how the industry and the technology are changing and where they might find a place that suits them.
If the federal grant is pulled, “these dollars are irreplaceable,” Bukiewicz said. “It’s not just taking money away and eliminating classes. It’s eliminating opportunities and a chance for generational change for people who really need it.”

The superintendent of Moore Public Schools didn’t think the Oklahoma Legislature made the right choice when implementing a statewide ban on student cellphones in schools this year. He thought parents would be against it and teachers would spend too much time policing the rule.
“I’m all about eating crow when I have to, and they got this one right,” he said.
Now nine weeks into the school year, Romines said “things have gone really, really well.” Discipline incidents have significantly decreased, he said, and students are more engaged with their teachers and each other.  
Students are passing footballs and playing volleyball in high school courtyards during lunch period. Junior high students are playing cards and board games.
“Those are things that we would not have seen last year and in previous years,” he said. “That’s big. I mean, that’s huge. It’s just been a really good thing.”

Senate Bill 139 prohibited student use of personal electronic devices, including cellphones and smart watches, for the entire school day. The law required all public school districts to comply with the full-day ban for the 2025-26 school year. After that, each local school board can decide whether to continue with the policy or try something different.
Romines said he expects Moore to keep the policy next year, though the decision isn’t his to make alone. 
He said it’s been helpful that all public schools in the state are under the same cellphone rule, so “parents can’t come back and say, ‘Well, Norman does it this way. Moore does it this way. Mustang does it this way, Edmond does it this way.’” The lack of comparison has helped with acceptance.
In Bartlesville Public Schools, cellphones had become an incessant nuisance in seventh-grade teacher Heather Davis’ classroom. 
Davis, in her 32nd year of teaching, remembers when old Nokia cellphones first appeared in her students’ hands, but once personal devices started connecting to social media, “that’s when I saw the uptick in kids checking out of school and checking into their cellphones.”
“It was constant lunch detentions, calls home, sent to the office, all of that,” she said. “And I would say that probably it was a problem for about 30% to 40% of my students.”

That changed dramatically this year with the statewide ban in place. So far, Davis said she’s had to discipline only one student for breaking the rule.
Her school had attempted to crack down on cellphones in the past, but this time, students and their parents have been more willing to comply, knowing the policy comes from a state law, she said.
It’s made a noticeable difference in her English language arts classes, she said. More students are participating, asking questions and completing their work.
“My kids are way more engaged,” Davis said. “I have a lot more students who are passing at this point in the class in the school year.”
Another seventh-grade teacher, Melanie Darter, said the cellphone ban has been a “game changer” at John W. Rex Charter Intermediate School in Oklahoma City. 
Students at the school are required to leave their cellphones in their backpacks for the day, said Darter, who teaches science.

“I haven’t seen one yet,” Darter said while speaking at an interim study Tuesday at the state Capitol. “Every once in a while, one will ring in my class, but it’s because it’s in their backpack. And so, I’m like, hey, I don’t even care. It’s away. So, they’re doing really well with that.”
An author of SB 139, Sen. Ally Seifried, R-Claremore, said she hears from educators and parents multiple times a week about the impact of the cellphone ban — stories of extra books being checked out in school libraries and anecdotes of classmates showing more togetherness.
Given the perceived success of the cellphone ban, Seifried and the law’s House author, Rep. Chad Caldwell, R-Enid, are now exploring whether other technology, like Chromebooks, should be limited in schools. They didn’t draw a definitive conclusion during their interim study on the topic Tuesday, but both said they want to continue the conversation. 
In the meantime, Caldwell said feedback has been “really, really positive” with SB 139 in effect.
“Just the stories we’ve heard from our educators about the laughter and the conversation that is filling our hallways and our lunchrooms, I think that’s exciting,” he said. “And you take a look at increased learning opportunities and a decrease in behavioral issues, I mean, that is a true win-win. I think it’s a very simple change, but it’s one that’s really having a profound impact on our kids.”

 Idaho wants to exempt some services for personal agencies, family homes from Medicaid pay cuts

The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare announced 4% cuts to Medicaid provider reimbursement rates in late August. The move was in response to Gov. Brad Little’s order for mid-year budget cuts across state government to avoid a budget shortfall.
Idaho cuts doctor pay rates for Medicaid. More cuts could come, Health and Welfare says.

The Medicaid pay cuts are already in effect, sort of.
The state is paying providers the usual reimbursement rates. But once Idaho gets permission from the federal government, the state can claw back funds for the cuts.
Health and Welfare spokesperson Greg Stahl told the Idaho Capital Sun last week that the agency is asking the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to let the state exempt services for personal care and certified family homes from the cuts. 
“The requests held harmless personal care services and certified family homes from rate adjustments following the required access analysis and public comment,” Stahl said in an email. “The department will post an information release for providers in the coming weeks with more details.”
 Idaho can’t afford to lose more providers, advocate says

Idaho Association of HomeCare Agency President Lindsey Hendricks said exempting disability care providers from the cuts doesn’t solve their financial issues.
“We’re still so far behind on where we should be with reimbursement rates,” she told the Sun. 
If payments stay on track, about a quarter of Idaho personal care agencies are at risk of closing within the next year, according to a survey by the organization. And if the state’s cuts to Medicaid payments extend to disability care providers, even more agencies anticipate they’d be forced to make tough decisions, like closing their doors, cutting staff pay or services.

In 2023, a report by the Idaho Office of Performance Evaluations estimated Idaho had a shortfall of 3,000 direct care workers. But by 2023, the report projected the shortfall would more than triple — to 9,500 workers. 
Idaho can’t afford to lose any more providers, said Idaho Council on Developmental Disabilities Executive Director Christine Pisani. 
“We are well on our way of having a complete void of service providers as a result of not addressing the direct care workforce crisis in Home and Community-Based Services,” she told the Sun. “So, who’s really going to get hit hard are our seniors, people with disabilities and families. And our rural areas have already been left behind. … So anything they do have, I think is going to be lost.” 
Most of the home care providers in the Idaho Health Care Association already don’t take Medicaid — because the program’s reimbursement rate hasn’t kept up with costs, said the group’s Executive Director Robert Vande Merwe.
Exempting them from the cuts, he said, “keeps them at status quo, which is still not enough.”
“We’re urging the Legislature not to cut taxes again, unless they have a plan to stabilize the budget,” Vande Merwe said. 
He thinks the governor may need to cut spending more “just to stay whole from the last year’s tax cuts,” he said. “If they cut taxes again this session, boy, there’s going to be dramatic cuts in services.”

Several relief programs are now available to certain homeowners. Some require an application.
The post What to know about applying for Wyoming’s property tax exemptions appeared first on WyoFile .","The application window is now open for several property tax relief programs in Wyoming, including exemptions for veterans, long-term homeowners and owner-occupied residential properties. 
WyoFile spoke with Dixie Huxtable, Converse County clerk and legislative committee chairperson for the Wyoming County Assessors’ Association, about what homeowners need to know to save on their tax bills. 
Property taxes have been a major focus of the Wyoming Legislature in recent years, and county officials have done everything from mailings and media advertisements to town halls and visits to the local senior citizen center. 
Still, Huxtable said, some homeowners are not aware of what’s available to them. 
“I’d like to think that we’ve done as much as we can to reach everybody but I still get people — I’ve had people since the first of October, come to my counter and say, ‘I’ve never heard of this before. I didn’t know anything about this until my neighbor told me,’” Huxtable said. 
The one cost-savings program in state law that does not require homeowners to fill out an application is a 4% cap on year-to-year property tax increases. 
Technically, Huxtable said, there are two 4% caps — one is applied to the residential structure, another to the associated residential land. But neither require any action on the homeowner’s part. From there, assessors consider exemptions in an order set by state law. 
Exemptions
Homeowners who live in their home for at least eight months of the year are eligible for a 25% exemption on the first $1 million of the property’s fair market value. 
Last tax year, the exemption was automatically applied to all single-family homes in Wyoming. Homeowners must now apply online by Feb. 1, which includes signing an affidavit affirming they occupy the property. Because an estimated 175,000 homeowners will qualify for the program, Huxtable said the assessors worked with the Department of Revenue to develop the website. 
“We tried to come up with an efficient way to do it, and I’m sure it’s going to have some hiccups. It has had some hiccups, but we’re trying to work it out as best we can to meet the law,” Huxtable said. 
She also said she understands the online process may be difficult for some to access on their own. 
“I have parents that are 95 and 89 years old, and they live at home and they pay their own bills. But they don’t understand this. They don’t have a computer,” Huxtable said.
Wyoming’s older homeowners have another tax-saving option with an exemption specifically for residents 65 years of age and older. Those residents — who have also paid property taxes in the state for at least 25 years — may qualify for a 50% exemption. The home must also be their primary residence. 
Homeowners may apply at their local county assessor’s office before May 26. However, homeowners may not receive both the 25% and the 50% exemptions. 
“It’s not cumulative. It’s one or the other,” Huxtable said. 
Lastly, there is an exemption available for veterans. It reduces the assessed valuation by $6,000, and can also be applied to a vehicle. Applications are available at the local county assessor’s office and are due May 26. 
While not an exemption, the state’s property tax refund program may be another option for homeowners. Whether the program is available will depend on whether lawmakers chose to fund it in the upcoming session. Some legislators are interested in taking things in a different direction, including abolishing property taxes altogether. 
Meanwhile, some homeowners have urged the Legislature to skip further property tax cuts, citing concerns about funding for public services. Property taxes don’t fund the state government, but rather pay for local services including schools, law enforcement, roads, water and sewer systems, parks and libraries. 
In her own community, Huxtable said she’s noticed people becoming more aware of what property taxes pay for. 
“As this progresses, I think people are beginning to understand that it’s going to have an effect on the services that they’ve come to expect,” Huxtable said.

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)Earlier this month, Oklahoma’s state Insurance Department issued a stark warning that should alarm us all.
When federally enhanced tax credits expire at the end of the year, some Oklahomans will see their health insurance premiums increase by over 75%. The state agency additionally warned that the termination of the federal program and stricter eligibility verification checks will likely “result in a significant decrease in enrollment.”
Insurance Commissioner Glen Mulready, a Republican, has urged Congress “to take a softer approach to ending” the subsidies and warned that “the impact to Oklahoma hospital systems is yet to be realized.”
That’s because nearly 300,000 Oklahomans rely on the federal marketplace for health insurance. The tax credits, which end unless Congress takes action, provide financial assistance to help Americans afford health insurance through the marketplace created by the Affordable Care Act. The marketplace serves as a safety net for people who don’t have employer-sponsored plans or don’t qualify for public programs like Medicaid or Medicare.
Slightly over 10% of the nearly 4 million Oklahomans are already uninsured, higher than the national average of 8%.
Instead of taking Mulready’s suggestion for a “softer approach,” we’re getting the nuclear option of a federal government shutdown.
Meanwhile, Oklahoma’s Republican congressional representatives won’t publicly even consider a pitch by Democrats to permanently restore those federal health subsidies. 
It makes them seem completely tone-deaf to the plight our state is facing even as they heroically fight for their party’s honor.
To be clear, I blame every elected official in D.C. for the shutdown that began Oct. 1. And, I think Democrats are foolhardy to try to use a shutdown like this to leverage this policy goal even if it is needed.
But I don’t understand why both sides can’t temporarily compromise on Republicans’ plan for a short-term extension that keeps the government open until Nov. 21 to give the GOP time to work out the logistics of continuing this vital program. I also don’t understand why Republicans won’t commit to extending this in exchange for ending this shutdown.
This inability to even consider compromise is making me wonder what we’re paying Congress for when they can’t even do their most basic job — pass a budget that lasts an entire fiscal year.
After all, they’re supposed to represent our needs in D.C. That should mean Oklahomans’ needs trump their political party’s. (No pun intended.)
And right now, 300,000 Oklahomans — and frankly our state’s entire health care system — need extended access to those affordable insurance premiums that Democrats are fighting for. (Americans covered by private employers also need access to affordable premiums, but that’s a whole other issue.)
I understand the reluctance to give Republicans more time, but the stakes are too high here to mess this up.
Still I figured our congressional delegations would be spending their days trying to broker a bipartisan compromise to make sure our state’s federal workers get paid.
Republican Sen. James Lankford, after all, showed an inspiring level of bipartisanship in 2024 when he worked across party lines to help develop a plan to help fix our immigration system. But his party rejected the proposal and hung him out to dry after then-presidential candidate Donald Trump pooh-poohed it, so I can understand his reluctance to stick his neck out here. 
Maybe Lankford should be trying to keep a low profile, though. He apparently had so much time on his hands last week that he was making the rounds on seemingly any television show that would have him. He blamed Democrats trying to appeal to their “far-left base” even as service members risk missing paychecks because of the shutdown.
And then he was even so bold to post this gem on social media about Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer: “Sen. Schumer believes this shutdown is a success for the Democrats politically. You’ve got to be kidding me – members of our military are serving our country while not getting paid.”
You know who is getting paid? Lankford and Schumer. 
Congress gets paid even if they’re not working because they’re protected by the U.S. Constitution during government shutdowns even while members of our military, air traffic controllers and hundreds of thousands of American employees go without.
Not to be left out, Republican U.S. Rep. Stephanie Bice, asked Schumer on her social media account if he would “like to explain how missing a paycheck makes things better for hard-working Oklahomans?”
I’d be very curious to know how losing federal health insurance subsidies make things better for hard-working Oklahomans, too.
Americans are not paying our delegation to sit on their behinds and play the blame game on TV and social media.
It’s time for them to remember who they represent and take this my-way-or-the-highway mentality and shove it where it belongs. They should serve the voters, not their political parties.

The grant would support BWXT's proposed TRISO plant, while another $10 million would support carbon capture and a potential new coal-fueled power unit, all in Campbell County. 
The post Wyoming considers $100M bet on nuclear fuel manufacturing appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming’s top energy agency is recommending a $100 million grant to support long-time U.S. Navy contractor BWXT Technologies’ TRISO nuclear fuel manufacturing plant in Gillette, as well as nearly $10 million in grants to continue carbon capture research and a potential new coal-fueled power unit, all in Campbell County.
Another potential grant award for $343,000 would support a feasibility study to expand a carbon dioxide pipeline network to boost enhanced oil recovery.
The Wyoming Energy Authority announced the potential grant awards this week and will accept public comment before Gov. Mark Gordon makes a final determination about whether to approve each one. The grant programs are directed at energy projects in Wyoming that “are also receiving federal or private funding,” according to the agency.
“Like other [Energy Matching Funds] projects, these projects represent a turning point for Wyoming’s energy future,” Energy Authority Executive Director Rob Creager told WyoFile via email. “Their scale speaks to the seriousness with which our state approaches energy development and diversification, not as a short-term effort, but as a long-term strategy to keep Wyoming strong and energy dominant.” 
Nuclear fuel manufacturing
BWXT proposes to build a $500 million TRISO nuclear fuel manufacturing facility in Gillette. Construction of the “Category II” plant would begin about a year from now, with an in-service target of 2030, according to the Lynchburg, Virginia-based company.

TRISO consists of tiny enriched uranium pellets the size of a poppyseed, each encased in “carbon- and ceramic-based materials that prevent the release of radioactive fission products,” according to the Department of Energy. TRISO can withstand higher temperatures than traditional nuclear fuels, and the fuel never leaves the encased pellet, according to the agency.
Importantly, BWXT officials noted, “The facility [in Wyoming] will not produce or store any high-level radioactive waste or spent nuclear fuel and will not be licensed to do so by the [U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission],” the company said in its application to the state.
Separately, BWXT received a $10 million grant from the state in 2023 to study how to tap Wyoming’s existing and potential machining, fabrication and manufacturing facilities to build a supply chain for microreactors. The company inked a tentative agreement last year with trona miner and soda ash producer TATA Chemicals for microreactors to be installed at its facility in southwest Wyoming.
Joshua Parker, BWXT’s senior director of Advanced Nuclear Fuel, recently spoke at a company-sponsored event in Gillette to explain why nuclear energy is receiving renewed interest and to update residents on the company’s dealings in Wyoming.

“We are an energy-starved country,” Parker told a crowd of about 200, adding that the need to support the electricity-hungry artificial intelligence boom is a matter of national security. “Here’s the thing: It takes every energy source. It’s not nuclear, it’s everything. It’s all. We need [natural gas], we need coal … We’re about to have growth in energy that we haven’t seen since coming out of World War II.
“Wyoming,” he continued, “you all have the workforce. You all have the manufacturing. You all have the energy drive. You have uranium here. You have all of those things that make a good energy community.”
BWXT’s pending $100 million grant would be the first and sole recipient of Wyoming’s Large Project Energy Matching Fund, created in 2024. If approved, the grant would fully tap the fund’s $100 million appropriation.
The Energy Authority kicked off a 45-day public comment period regarding the grant recommendation, closing on Nov. 25. Public comments can be sent to wea@wyo.gov.
Coal and carbon dioxide grants
The Wyoming Energy Authority is also considering recommending nearly $10 million from another grant program — Energy Matching Funds — to help support three other energy projects in the state.
Basin Electric Power Cooperative is asking for $4 million for an engineering and feasibility study to analyze whether to build a second coal-fueled unit at its Dry Fork Station power plant north of Gillette. The “Dry Fork Station Unit 2” study, a partnership between Basin Electric and engineering firm Sargent and Lundy, includes evaluating “boiler technologies, air quality control systems and air quality compliance,” according to an application submitted to the agency.

“Moreover, the study will provide a comprehensive comparison of coal generation alongside alternative energy sources, allowing Basin Electric to align its resource planning with current energy market trends and regulatory standards,” the company said.
The 400-plus megawatt-capacity Dry Fork Station was completed in 2011 and gets its coal from the associated Dry Fork mine. It was designed to incorporate carbon capture research.
“Recently many states have talked about their aspirations of building a new coal plant, Wyoming included,” the Energy Authority’s Creager said. “This is the first of many steps towards building America’s next coal plant in Wyoming that will use millions of tons of Powder River Basin coal annually.”
A second Energy Matching Funds grant for $5.5 million would go to the University of Wyoming School of Energy Resources to advance its work tied to coal-carbon capture technology at the Integrated Test Center, which is mostly housed at the same Dry Fork Station complex.
“The project aims to expand the [Integrated Test Center’s] capabilities by accommodating a wider range of carbon management technologies,” according to the application. “The facility upgrades and operating plan will help ensure continued [Test Center] operations beyond 2026, attract diverse research tenants and strengthen Gillette’s role as a national hub for carbon management innovation and workforce development.”
The Energy Matching Funds considerations also include Contango’s application for $343,000 to expand a carbon dioxide pipeline network in the Big Horn Basin in support of enhanced oil recovery. 
All three proposals are open for public comment, closing on Oct. 18. Public comments can be sent to wea@wyo.gov.

As the pile grows in the sink and grows mold, doing the dishes becomes a more overwhelming task, but having help can make it easier, writes Ben Anderson.
The post Politics is like dirty dishes appeared first on WyoFile .","No one ever wants to hand-wash the dishes. It’s boring, gross, time-consuming and thankless. It’s even worse when the dishes haven’t been done in weeks. The growing mold, the stack towering ever taller, the mental drain of fighting over who’s fault it is or even just beating yourself up for letting it get this bad. We get overwhelmed, hoping someone else does them. 

Opinion

Politics and the government are that stack of dishes, except instead of piling up for weeks, it’s been decades. The mold and toxicity have reached life-threatening levels. It’s past time for us to do the dishes!
If the government is dishes, life is the food we eat off them. The purpose of dishes is to make it easier and safer to eat. Hot soup is much easier to eat with a bowl and spoon instead of your hands. Government is supposed to play a similar role, making many aspects of life easier for everyone. The government should help meet everyone’s needs and resolve conflicts, just as bowls and spoons make dishing out soup in equal amounts easier.
Everyone eats from the political plates, whether they think so or not. Everyone drinks water, and its acceptable cleanliness levels are determined by the government. Everyone breathes air, and ideally, regulations say corporations can’t expose us to deadly levels of toxins. Everyone also needs health care, yet those who are the least lucky and need help the most end up with unpayable amounts of debt. Either eat your health care soup out of this moldy bowl of insurance, or burn your hand reaching into the pot. 
We argue and bicker about whose turn it is to do the dishes, but someone inevitably points out that we can order pizza and not do the dishes. That benefits the pizza shop, but it’s not a long-term solution.
What does doing the dishes look like? It’s hard work, and commonly boring. It’s going to the city council meeting and talking to your friends about it. It’s getting on the live stream for the Wyoming Legislature’s subcommittees and telling them what you think. It’s voting in primaries. It’s being a political candidate. It’s staying informed and supporting your local, independent news sources. It’s convincing others to help.
This is all too much for one person to do. But just like hand-washing dishes, you don’t actually do it alone. You benefit from the work put into manufacturing the sponges, the research on what makes a good dish soap and the marketing, so you know those products even exist. Those tools are community organizing. It’s way easier if we work together. Just like society, the whole is greater than the parts.
I ask all of you reading to help do the dishes. I don’t want anyone else to die from the bacteria, and the only way to ensure that is to get in there and start scrubbing. The pile may not be our fault, but it is our responsibility. If we all agree to take on one dish, we can get them clean again.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout) A mother with a 4-week-old baby sent a request for help to the hotline for a grassroots Memphis food pantry focused on serving immigrant families. Her plea reached Jessica Miller, a volunteer and spokesperson for The Collective Good Immigrant Pantry.
“She had been having to feed (the baby) sugar water for two days because she didn’t have any formula and the husband had gotten deported,” Miller said. “So we delivered formula and diapers.”
The pantry — run completely by volunteers out of garages and spare rooms — is ramping up its operations to meet surging needs as federal law enforcement agencies patrol the city as part of the Trump administration’s “Memphis Safe Task Force.”
The Collective Good collects and delivers boxes of food and hygiene essentials to families in need. This can include families in financial distress after a primary provider was detained or deported, or those who are afraid to leave their homes to get groceries.
“There’s so many situations we run into with people … the husband’s been deported, the person that provided for them, right? And then the mom is there with kids that are hungry and they don’t know what to do,” Miller said.
The pantry has also helped immigrant families who have decided to leave the U.S. out of fear, but cannot easily do so because their children are American citizens.
“The children need passports and paperwork,” she said. “It’s not as easy as people think to deport American citizens to another country.”

The pantry, part of the mutual aid arm of progressive organizing group Indivisible Memphis, launched its hotline in July following a string of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations in primarily Hispanic neighborhoods, Miller said. A group of concerned advocates saw that “food was going to be a big need” for those who remained. 
From July until the task force’s arrival on Sept. 29, the pantry averaged a little over eight deliveries per week, meeting all requests submitted through the hotline. Last week, the pantry made 22 deliveries. At least 100 requests had poured in as of Oct. 8.
Of the requests received, at least half have come from families with babies in need of formula and diapers.
A local church recently hosted a “baby shower” for the pantry, collecting baby essentials to help the pantry meet growing needs. 
“Politics aside, I don’t know how anybody can look at … babies crying with hunger pain and not think that needs help, or that something’s wrong with that,” Miller said.
Federal task force tallies 562 arrests; exact charges are unclear
U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi reported the task force made 562 total arrests and seized 144 illegal guns as of Thursday, before the arrival of National Guard troops on Friday. The U.S. Department of Justice did not respond to a request for further information about the charges related to those arrests.
Lead organizers for Free the 901, a coalition of Memphis advocacy groups steering response to the federal task force, say they have received hundreds of reports from community members of federal law enforcement agents from multiple agencies working alongside Tennessee Highway Patrol officers to conduct traffic stops throughout the city, particularly in areas with high concentrations of minority residents. 
Tennessee Lookout independently observed several traffic stops on Tuesday evening where agents wearing gear marked as FBI, U.S. Marshalls, Homeland Security Investigations and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were present alongside THP officers. 
THP did not respond by the time of publication  to requests for traffic stop data, and it’s unclear how many of the 562 arrests reported by the task force may have resulted from these traffic stops.
Information released to Tennessee Lookout by the Department of Justice on Oct. 7 indicated that roughly 24% of the 386 arrests to that point were done on “administrative ICE warrants.” These warrants are issued by ICE officers to remove non-citizens from the United States, according to Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) materials.
Administrative ICE warrants are not criminal warrants, are not signed by a judge or magistrate, and cannot be used to enter private areas such as individuals’ homes. While the “underlying basis for a non-citizen’s removability may be due to some criminal violation,” FLETC Senior Legal Instructor John Seaman stated in a training transcript, an administrative ICE warrant only indicates that an ICE official determined a person is “removable from the United States.”
The arrest data from Oct. 7 also indicated that 63 arrests were for “other” purposes and 125 were for “warrants,” with no additional information on the type of offense. Of the 386 arrests, two were for homicide charges, two were related to probation or parole, 20 were for sex offenses, 30 for narcotics and 50 for firearms-related charges.
Not a typical food bank
Miller describes the Collective Good Immigrant Pantry as a “true mutual aid network operating differently than traditional food banks, which sometimes require paperwork or identification.
The volunteers who started the pantry consulted with leaders in the Latino community to ensure that pantry boxes contain familiar ingredients and spices.
“We did this to fit the Latino community,” she said. “The systems that have failed us aren’t going to be the answer to this, so we decided that we’re going to be the answer for it.”
The pantry collects donations of nonperishable foods and hygiene items through its Amazon wishlist, and accepts cash donations to ensure that each delivery also contains fresh dairy, meat and produce.

Volunteers try to pack the boxes with enough food to feed families for a week. They also include items like coffee and lotion, because “we recognize that even though they’re going through the most traumatic time of their life, they still deserve some happy in their life, too,” Miller said.
Families in need reach out to the pantry’s hotline and provide details on the numbers of adults and children needing food, as well as any allergies. Volunteers then deliver the boxes directly. 
Along with meeting emergent needs, the pantry connects families with longer-term resources offered by other advocacy groups. 
When requests for help shot up, the small group of original pantry volunteers began to get overwhelmed and burnt out, Miller said, but then about 120 people from all over Shelby and surrounding counties answered a call for new volunteers.
“Every week I go into the new week praying that we’ll be able to help more people,” she said. “And sometimes it gets to the point where we’re a little low on funds or low on supplies, but it’s always provided so far.”
Miller said she looks forward to the day when the food bank initiative is not needed, but until that point, her goal is for “our voices to be louder than the ones saying this (federal task force) is what our city needs to make it better.”",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Memphis-Food-Bank002-1024x651.jpg,,,2025-10-13 06:56:19.039528

If you’re a longtime follower of North Carolina politics and local news, you might know me from my seven years as Capitol Bureau Chief at WUNC/NC Public Radio, or the blog I wrote there for many years, Isaac Hunter’s Tavern, or from my 14 years as Capitol Bureau Chief at WRAL.
I’ve worked on many fulfilling and award-winning projects over those years, including a series on poverty at WUNC that won a duPont-Columbia Silver Baton for public service. And, of course, I’ve been in the thick of coverage of political contests in the national spotlight, like the 2024 N.C. Supreme court race, the 2024 N.C. gubernatorial race, and our state’s seemingly endless court battles over redistricting, from county courts to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Over that time, I’ve watched Democrats and Republicans rise and fall, from Jim Black and Mike Easley to Robin Hayes and Mark Harris. What I’ve learned is that unchecked power — no matter whose hands it’s in — is never good for the people those officials serve.
That’s why I don’t believe either side has a monopoly on good ideas. I’ve spent the past 21 years explaining to North Carolinians why their state lawmakers have passed certain laws and how those laws and regulations will affect their lives. That will not change now that I’m at NC Newsline. 
We’re here to ask the questions you might ask and tell you how your elected officials did or didn’t answer them.
And when it comes to election coverage, our focus will be on policy instead of the horserace. You can see poll results anywhere. Smart explorations of the issues that matter to you are much harder to come by. That’s what we’re here for. Not to take sides.
We’ll continue to deliver the in-depth coverage for which you’ve come to rely on us. Greg Childress, Lynn Bonner and Clayton Henkel will still bring their years of experience to bear. Ahmed Jallow, Brandon Kingdollar, Christine Zhu and Galen Bacharier will keep bringing their sharp eyes and new perspectives to what we do. Former editor Rob Schofield will continue to provide commentary.
I won’t be writing many columns. I prefer to leave that to those who aren’t involved in daily reporting and editing, although I reserve the right to weigh in on First Amendment and press freedom issues, or course!
I believe an educated electorate is necessary to make democracy work, and what you can learn about your government shouldn’t depend on how much money you make. State policy affects everyone, especially those who are least able to pay to find out about it.
That’s why we’re working hard to expand our reach. There are a lot of small local newspapers and news sites in North Carolina that can’t afford wire services. We want to bring their readers quality coverage of their state government. Donations from readers like you can help us do that.
Thank you for reading. We’ll be here. We hope you will, too.

(Erin Bamer/Nebraska Examiner)TEKAMAH, Neb. — After a months-long dispute, the maintenance of several rural cemeteries in Burt County seems to have reached a resolution, not through the creation of a new board, but a much simpler answer.
Some residents have been pleading with the Tekamah Cemetery District to boost their efforts to maintain three rural cemeteries within the district’s boundaries. Several contend that the board is too focused on maintaining the largest cemetery in the area — Tekamah Cemetery — and let the other cemeteries fall into disrepair.
“When you see the scale of it, it’s so one-sided,” said one resident Lisa Anderson.
Months went by with little to no progress until Anderson proposed at the board’s Sept. 18 meeting that the residents themselves could oversee the maintenance through a separate rural cemetery board. The board agreed to consider this option, and left open the possibility of siphoning off more than $16,000 of its $154,000 budget for the new board.
But at the board’s latest meeting Tuesday, member John Chamberlain said he was unsure that the new board would be legally sound. He later explained that since their board is a bonded agency and the rural board wouldn’t be, that may cause complications.
“There’s a lot of hurdles to jump before we can do this,” Chamberlain said.

The primary need the residents are concerned about is mowing. At the Tekamah Rural Seventh Day Adventist Cemetery, grass and weeds have begun to grow over some of the headstones. Church members claim the cemetery hasn’t been mowed since May, when prior to that the cemetery board had regularly maintained it for decades.
Board members said they had received advice from the Burt County assessor that determined the board shouldn’t continue caring for the cemetery because the land is privately owned by the church, though the cemetery’s defenders argue the cemetery remains public.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
After the meeting, board members clarified that the board continued to spend money on mowing two of the other rural cemeteries, Arizona and Silver Creek. Crew member Mike Camron said he and his team mow the two cemeteries about once a month.
By comparison, Tekamah Cemetery gets mowed almost daily. One reason: This cemetery is the largest in the county — about 70 acres — so it takes a full week to finish mowing the full property, Camron said.
By the end of the week, grass that was mowed on Monday is in need of mowing again, Camron said. This challenge is part of the reason why care for the rural cemeteries has lagged, Chamberlain said.

On Tuesday, the board proposed a different solution. Members agreed to increase the mowing of Arizona and Silver Creek cemeteries to twice a month. Additionally, they approved setting aside a maximum of $3,625 to pay for mowing the Seventh Day Adventist cemetery up to eight times before the cemetery board’s next budget cycle begins on June 30. The board tasked residents with finding a mowing contractor who can do the work within the price range.
Chamberlain told the Nebraska Examiner that state statutes offer little clarity on the board’s authority to care for private land that houses a public cemetery. Eventually, he said the board “got tired of fighting” residents on the issue, which led to the proposal.
“We came here tonight to work with you,” Chamberlain told the roughly 20 attendees at the meeting.
At one point, the board considered splitting the cost of mowing the church cemetery 50/50 with the residents, based on the private land vs. public cemetery conflict, Chamberlain said. Ultimately, members decided against that option and agreed to handle the funding.
Meeting attendees appeared pleased with the outcome, especially as one said she had a relative who may be able to mow the church cemetery. One attendee called the resolution a “win-win” for both parties.

An employee to operate this lab and help place students in internships won't be funded following federal grant cuts. (Photo provided by Central Carolina)A tutoring hub, a center to help students land jobs after earning their diploma and an academic advising office to keep students on track to graduate — these are all things Central Carolina Technical College has been able to add to its campus over the past 15 years with the help of federal grant funds awarded to colleges with a large percentage of minority students.
But now that grant program is ending, as the U.S. Department of Education claws back $350 million in funds for schools with large populations of Hispanic, Black, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiians, Native Americans, and Asian Americans and Pacific Islander students.
Because of this, Central Carolina won’t receive the nearly $350,000 it had left on its five-year, $1.6 million grant, said Lisa Bracken, the college’s vice president of student affairs.
“That $1.6 million, for us, was an awful lot of money,” she said.
How the grant was used
The college was using this latest grant round for three things — a program to flag and help students at risk of dropping or failing out of school, a staff member dedicated to placing healthcare students in internships and clinicals and a team of degree advisers.
Central Carolina, which has its main campus in Sumter plus three satellite campuses in Manning, Camden and Bishopville, managed to get budget approvals from the General Assembly to make four of these grant-funded employees permanent hires.
“Had we not done that, every bit of this would have gone away,” Bracken said, of those positions.
But the school had to let go two workers it could no longer pay, forcing other employees to take on the extra workload.

Nationwide, more than $250 million of the recalled federal funding was for the government’s Hispanic-Serving Institution program, which offers grants to colleges and universities where at least a quarter of undergraduates are Hispanic.
There was also $22 million for schools where at least 40% of the students are Black. The remaining $28 million went to schools with large populations of other minority groups.
In addition to Central Carolina, two other South Carolina colleges — Orangeburg-Calhoun Technical College and Florence-Darlington Technical College — lost funding under the program for what are known as Predominantly Black Institutions, according to Kelly Steinhilper, a spokeswoman for the state technical college system.
Neither of the other two schools responded to messages from the SC Daily Gazette.
Exempt from cuts
Tribal colleges and historically Black colleges and universities, which are open to all students regardless of race, are exempt from the cuts and will actually receive more funding as the Education Department redistributes a total of $495 million from the grant money and other cancelled funds.
How much of that one-time funding will go to South Carolina HBCUs is unclear.
South Carolina State University, the state’s only public four-year HBCU, is waiting for additional details about how the Education Department will distribute the funding, spokesman Sam Watson said.
“SC State continues to work to ensure that our students have fair and adequate access to resources,” he said. “We will evaluate the specifics of this investment once they are available to determine its potential impact on SC State.”
The state’s six private HBCUs declined to comment or did not respond to the Gazette’s messages.
How cancelled National Institutes of Health grants are impacting SC college students

In eliminating the grants, the Education Department claimed they violated the Fifth Amendment’s due process clause and its implied guarantees to equal protection. The department argues that these programs create unconstitutional “racial quotas.”
“Discrimination based upon race or ethnicity has no place in the United States,” U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon said in a statement. “Diversity is not merely the presence of a skin color. Stereotyping an individual based on immutable characteristics diminishes the full picture of that person’s life and contributions, including their character, resiliency, and merit.”
But Central Carolina is legislatively mandated to serve students across Sumter, Lee, Clarendon, and Kershaw counties. The school has about 800 full-time students, 2,200 part-time students and 590 high school students enrolled in classes, according to data from the state higher education agency.
The school’s student body, which is 45% Black and 57% minority, reflects the population of those counties and is not a product of efforts to recruit minority students, Bracken said.
The way the school used its grants also benefited all students — not just students of color.
“The assumption is that those funds are helping a small number of students and that is not the case,” Bracken said.
Getting programs off the ground
The money allowed the college to pilot several programs, helping get those initiatives off the ground.
“Without those funds, we would have had a very difficult time building a tutoring center from the ground up,” Bracken said. “We also used it to build out a Career Services Center. Before we had that grant, we provided what career services we could through our admissions office, but we didn’t have the software tools or the center where students could get on computers.”
“It gets you out there to where you can launch some some key things that really make a difference with your students,” she said of the grant program.

Over the last four years, the school started an early alert program to try to keep students in school.
“If you’ve got a student who doesn’t show up for class during that first week, that’s a risk indicator,” Bracken said.
In the first week of this fall semester, the school already had almost 500 early alerts for students.
From there, a designated staff member, paid for by the grant, reached out to each of those students to find out why they hadn’t shown up and to let them know what services the school has available.
“Sometimes it’s ‘My work schedule has changed and I can’t make it to class. I’ve had a death in the family. We have a serious illness. I don’t have child care. I don’t have transportation,’ ” Bracken said. “Life issues have gotten in the way.”
But the students may not realize or don’t always remember the school and its partner organizations in the community can help.
“For example, somebody can’t pay their light bill and so they’re choosing to take extra shifts at work rather than come to class,” Bracken said. “We have some emergency money that we’re able to then pay their light bill for that month. Cars break down. We’ve paid for student car repairs.”
The school will now continue this early alert program using state funds.
What is ending
Before the grant allowed the school to hire designated advisers, professors were advising students on what classes to take. With thousands of students enrolled, it was easy for some to slip through the cracks, accidentally taking classes that may not count toward their degree and not knowing what classes might transfer if they chose to change their major.
The college also will continue the new advising program using state funds, minus a part-time adviser that worked at the school’s Camden campus.

The third program, which the college does not have the money to continue, was for a designated staff member trained to operate and maintain the school’s high-tech health care simulation lab. That staff member also made all of the clinical placements with the local hospitals for students to get on-the-job experience required for completing their degrees.
Those jobs will again fall back on the professors teaching those classes. The difference now is those degree programs have grown significantly.
Between an associate’s degree in nursing and a Licensed Practical Nursing program, surgical technology and medical assisting, the school has added 45 new students in the past five years. It’s pre-nursing program, which feeds into those other degrees, has doubled, going from 250 students to 500, Bracken said.
“We’re full every semester,” she said.
For now, Central Carolina will still receive funds under a similar, annual grant program, which is considered mandatory under federal law.
Even so, the Trump administrations’ Education Department in a statement said it “continues to consider the underlying legal issues associated with the mandatory funding mechanism in these programs.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/CCTC_11282022_0045x7-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-13 06:56:19.039528

(Kevin Mohatt for Colorado Newsline)A billion-dollar bond proposal and a significant change to how at-large council members are elected are among the questions Denver voters will weigh in on in the city’s 2025 municipal election.

 Election 2025
Coloradans are voting on two statewide ballot measures and a variety of local issues in the off-year election. Click here for more of Newsline’s coverage.

Ballots began going out by mail Oct. 10 to all active registered voters in Colorado. The state’s coordinated 2025 election features two statewide ballot measures, Proposition LL and Proposition MM. Depending on where they live, voters will also be asked to weigh in on such items as local ballot issues, city council races, and school board races.
In the Mile High City, the off-year election features eight ballot measures, the first five of which comprise a $950 million package of Vibrant Denver infrastructure bonds backed by Mayor Mike Johnston. Two other questions were referred to the ballot by City Council. The eighth and final measure, known as a veto referendum, was placed on the ballot through a signature-gathering campaign by opponents of City Council’s passage of a flavored tobacco ban last year.

Election Day is Nov. 4. Eligible Coloradans can register to vote or update their registration at GoVoteColorado.com. Any eligible voter who registers to vote before Oct. 27 will receive a ballot in the mail. After Oct. 27, eligible voters can still register and vote in-person at a polling location until 7 p.m. on Election Day.
Voters who receive a mail ballot can return it through the mail, deposit it in a secure ballot drop box, or drop it off at an in-person polling location. County clerks in Colorado’s 64 counties oversee elections in their jurisdictions, and information about ballot drop box and in-person service locations is available at local county clerks’ websites.
 Vibrant Denver bond
Denver voters will decide whether to approve Ballot Issues 2A–2E, five pieces of the city’s proposed bond package individually: transportation and mobility projects totaling $441 million; parks and recreation projects totaling $175 million; health and human services projects totaling $30 million; city infrastructure and facilities projects totaling $244 million; and housing and shelter projects totaling $59 million.
City governments regularly issue bond proposals to finance infrastructure projects by taking on debt, without raising taxes. Other recent “general obligation” bond issues in Denver included the $260 million RISE Denver bond in 2021 and the $936 million Elevate Denver bond in 2017.
The city says more than 200 individual projects will be funded through the Vibrant Denver proposal. A combined $139 million would go towards rebuilding the Sixth Avenue and Eighth Avenue viaducts adjacent to the proposed site of a new Denver Broncos stadium in Burnham Yard. Other major projects include a new $75 million combined training facility for the city’s sheriff, police and fire departments and $70 million to transform the former Park Hill Golf Club into a new city park. A full list of projects is available on the city’s website.
An issue committee registered in support of measures 2A through 2E has received more than $1 million in contributions from a long list of Denver-based businesses, according to city campaign finance records. Its top donor is former MDC Holdings executive Larry Mizel, who contributed $65,000, while the Denver Zoo, Denver Art Museum and Denver Botanic Gardens are among those that have contributed $50,000 each.
Citizens for No New Debt, a committee registered by activist Jason Bailey, had spent $3,170 in opposition to the bond package as of Oct. 10.
 Renaming the Department of Excise and Licensing
Question 2F was referred to the ballot by Denver City Council. It would change the name of the Department of Excise and Licensing, which issues business and professional licenses to bars, marijuana dispensaries, contractors and dozens of other kinds of businesses within Denver. The ballot measure would update the agency’s name to the Department of Licensing and Consumer Protection, and amend language throughout the city’s municipal code to reflect the change.
The department calls the name change “part of an effort to modernize and make it easier to understand city government agency services.” Its current name is “confusing and misleading,” it says, because the department no longer handles the collection of excise taxes.
 At-large council elections
Question 2G, referred to the ballot by Denver City Council, would change how the city elects its two at-large members, who represent the entire city alongside 11 other members elected at the district level.
Currently, all candidates for at-large council seats run in a single race, with the top two vote-getters winning the two seats. In 2023, at-large council members Serena Gonzales-Gutierrez and Sarah Parady won their seats with 20% and 16% of the vote, respectively, from a field of 10 candidates.
Question 2G would significantly overhaul that process, dividing the at-large contest into separate races for “A” and “B” seats, and subjecting them to a runoff election if no candidate receives more than 50% of the vote.
The question was narrowly approved for the ballot by a 7-6 council vote, with Gonzales-Gutierrez, Parady and other progressive members opposed. By the same vote, council members defeated a progressive-backed proposal to put a ranked choice voting measure on the city’s 2025 ballot.
Supporters of the ballot measure, including the seven moderate council members, say the current system is confusing and allows unrepresentative candidates to win without majority support. Opponents call it an effort to target two of the council’s most progressive members.
Hands Off Denver Elections, a campaign committee formed “to reduce the influence of special interest big money,” has registered to oppose Referred Question 2G but had not reported any contributions as of Oct. 10. Its treasurer is Wynn Howell, Colorado state director of the Working Families Party.
 Flavored tobacco ban
In 2024, Denver City Council voted 11-1 to pass a ban on the sale of flavored tobacco products, including menthol cigarettes, flavored e-cigarette cartridges and flavored pouches and chews. Critics say these products are marketed to young people and put them at risk of nicotine addiction and other health impacts.
Opponents of the ban organized a signature-gathering campaign and collected the 9,400 valid signatures required to place a veto referendum on the 2025 ballot.
A yes vote on Referendum 310 will keep the ban in place. A no vote will repeal the ban.
A committee in support of the ban, Denver Kids vs. Big Tobacco, has raised more than $2 million to encourage a yes vote on Referendum 310, according to campaign finance records. Three-quarters of that funding came from billionaire former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a longtime benefactor of anti-tobacco causes.
Citizen Power, a committee registered to oppose the ban, has received over $434,000 in contributions from donors including the Rocky Mountain Smoke Free Alliance, a vaping industry trade group, as well as tobacco giants Altria and Philip Morris.

(Getty Images)Idaho’s public schools are a historic place of pride in Idaho’s growth and cultural development. They continue to anchor communities’ social structures by providing actual places that signify community unity. Beyond being just places of learning, they are where we vote, see our children grow and mature into social beings, sponsor organized sports, music, and arts, and provide a stage for public participation in political and civic discussion. In many of Idaho’s smaller rural communities, they strum as the region’s most vital organ.
The drafters of Idaho’s constitution recognized the local importance of public schools by requiring that the state establish and maintain a “general, uniform, and thorough system of public, free common schools in a safe environment conducive to learning” for all school districts in the state.
Advocacy coalition files lawsuit to block Idaho’s new private school tax credit

In its 2004 and 2006 opinions in litigation against the state brought by the Idaho Schools for Equal Educational Opportunity, however, the Idaho Supreme Court exposed the failure to adequately fund our public schools. Sadly, instead of responding to these decisions with increased public-school funding, our Legislature has gone in a different direction, further damaging the state’s public school system. 
 In the 2025 session of the Idaho Legislature, the Legislature passed, and the governor signed, House Bill 93, providing up to $5,000 per student tax credit ($7,500 for special needs students) for any pupil enrolled in a private school. This law will contribute significantly to the continued gutting of our public school system for the benefit of a select and elite few.
Private secondary schools in Idaho costs on average between $9,000 and $12,000 per year, depending upon the set of sources reviewed. Thus, unless a family can pony up about double what the state offers for each student, private schooling will remain the privilege of richer families. 
A recent national study discovered that students already enrolled in private schools are the biggest beneficiaries of new voucher programs. Not surprising, the same study found some private schools used the new voucher money to raise their tuition charges. Thus, overall, the same fortunate few go to private schools, but the schools get more money at taxpayer expense. A pretty good boondoggle if a family already enjoys that system, but not much of benefit for the less prosperous.  
The House Bill 93 giveaway does not contain any performance measurements. While our public schools operate under a gaze measuring the quality of outcomes, House Bill 93 spending has no such dimension. There exists no means in the new private school subsidy to gauge whether state funding of private schools provides any successful education. The bill openly invites charlatans and hucksters into Idaho’s educational space.
House Bill 93 devotes $50 million annually to the new voucher subsidy for the well-to-do. This makes no economic sense for Idaho. 
While the Legislature wants to give the advantaged more advantages, we currently suffer a $79.9 million shortfall in the current fiscal year general budget, causing a 3% holdback to some state budgets, and a separate $60 million shortfall in our Medicaid budget.
 If this voucher giveaway went away, it would cover most of one of these shortfalls. This must make any taxpayer who cannot afford a private school for their children cringe at the unfairness of this system. And those of us who live in or near Idaho towns that do not have private schools cannot even participate in the system.
More disheartening, while Idaho’s investment in public school spending has fallen 15% in the last 20 years, we can expect the voucher subsidy to bloat about 200% to 300% in the next ten years, as it did in Florida, Arizona, and Indiana.   
House Bill 93 is simply a bad idea funded by all taxpayers for the benefit of a chosen few and private businesses at a time when Idaho suffers budget shortfalls. The better idea is to properly fund our constitutional public school system for the benefit of us all.

(Photo by Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor) An international organization that seeks to protect water quality in the Red River will conduct a review of two large dairy projects underway in North Dakota. 
The provincial government of Manitoba announced in a news release that the International Joint Commission has directed its International Red River Watershed Board to review information and permits related to the dairy operations.
Minnesota-based Riverview LLP plans to build two milking operations near the Red River, which flows north into Canada and Lake Winnipeg — the Herberg Dairy in Traill County with 25,000 cows and the Abercrombie Dairy in Richland County with 12,500 cows. 
Both dairies have received permits from the North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality. That agency considers issues such as protecting groundwater and preventing polluted runoff into waterways. 
Marty Haroldson, director of the Division of Water Quality for the environmental agency, said it would answer questions or provide information to the International Joint Commission.
Manitoba Environment and Climate Change Minister Mike Moyes supported the decision by the International Joint Commission to assess the impacts of the projects on the Red River.
“The health of Manitoba’s lakes and rivers is a top priority for our government, and we want to be sure that developments upstream don’t negatively affect Lake Winnipeg and the Red River,” Moyes said in a news release Thursday. “We must protect Lake Winnipeg for generations to come.”
The Manitoba government and environmental groups are concerned about algae blooms in Lake Winnipeg, the world’s 10th largest fresh water lake. Nutrients from fertilizers, including cow manure, can contribute to algae blooms.

A letter from Moyes to North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong outlined the provincial government’s concerns. The letter said water quality monitoring in the Red River at the U.S.-Canada border shows that levels of nutrients are above target levels set by the two countries in 2022. 
In an emailed statement, Armstrong’s office said North Dakota follows state and federal laws related to permitting agricultural facilities. 
“Our state agencies apply the same high standards for protecting the Red River that they apply to all waters within North Dakota, and we have some of the safest drinking water in the country,” the Governor’s Office said.
The Manitoba Eco-Network, an environmental group, says Lake Winnipeg is one of the world’s most-threatened lakes with high rates of nitrogen and phosphorus that can come from fertilizers. 
The state permits show that the cows from the two dairies would produce about 214 million gallons of manure each year.

“Our dairies are designed, built and operated to be protective of the environment for generations to come,” Riverview said in a statement Friday. “Discharges to surface waters are prohibited by state and federal law, and our farms are designed and operated to meet or exceed strict environmental standards.”
Riverview squeezes out the liquid from its manure, separating it from the solids. The liquid manure is then transported through pipes or hoses to be injected into the soil of a farm field. There are no trucks hauling the liquid manure. 
Ted Preister, executive director of the Red River Basin Commission, a nonprofit group that has members from the U.S. and Canada, said the dairies have been a topic of discussion this summer, with Canadian officials seeking to learn more about the existing Riverview dairy operations in Minnesota and the planned dairies in North Dakota. 
He said the potential for 37,500 cows along the Red River is “a substantial concern” to Canadians who value Lake Winnipeg for its commercial fishing and recreation. 
Preister said the International Joint Commission can review permits to look for errors and can review water sampling reports to monitor for changes. If the commission finds something of concern, it would be up to Canada’s federal government to appeal to the U.S. Department of State. The commission’s findings could also be used in a legal challenge, he said. 
Preister said a visit to a Riverview dairy in Minnesota included Canadian representatives from the International Joint Commission, which can investigate pollution and water quality questions. 
He said Canadians asked “very pointed” questions of North Dakota’s Department of Environmental Quality, which approved permits for the two dairies.

Phone messages left with the International Joint Commission were not returned Friday.
Canada and the United States created the International Joint Commission to manage lakes and rivers along their border. 
The International Red River Watershed Board is an independent group established by the International Joint Commission under the Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909. The board assists the commission in preventing or resolving disputes regarding the Red River and its tributaries. 
Madeline Luke has been the point person for the Dakota Resource Council on the group’s concerns about the large dairies.
“Pollution, like water, has no boundaries,” Luke said in an email. “The IJC is a non-political body with deep technical expertise. So with the urgent need to avoid further harm to Lake Winnipeg, this action is much applauded.”

As many as 845 people incarcerated in Mississippi Department of Corrections facilities were confirmed to be living with hepatitis C between January and March of this year, records show. During the same period, 48 people – or less than 6% with documented diagnoses – received treatment. 
But in private, officials have at times cited a much higher caseload – 5,000 cases out of about 19,000 people incarcerated by the state. This suggests that public records may reveal only a small portion of a widespread hepatitis C problem in Mississippi’s prisons, a state lawmaker with direct oversight over the corrections department told Mississippi Today. 
As people in the care of the state suffer and the treatable illness continues to fester, she said, officials aren’t using resources available to them to lower the costs of medications. 
This year’s treatment numbers represent an improvement over last year, when 19 people in state prisons – or 2% with diagnoses – received medication for hepatitis C. In 2020, only three people received treatment.

Department of Corrections spokesperson Kate Head did not answer questions from Mississippi Today about why at least hundreds of people in its custody with the contagious illness are not receiving treatment. But she said the agency’s medical contractor “is responsible for providing appropriate medical treatment to inmates with all medical conditions, including Hep C.” 
VitalCore Health Strategies, a company that holds a three-year, $357-million contract to provide medical care to Mississippi prisoners, declined to comment. The company was previously awarded over $315 million in emergency, no-bid state contracts from 2020 to 2024.
Data obtained by Mississippi Today show a clear disparity between the number of people who test positive for the virus and the number of people who receive treatment. 
Behind closed doors, state officials and VitalCore executives have been briefed on a much larger volume of cases, House Corrections Chairwoman Rep. Becky Currie told Mississippi Today. 
Mississippi has one of the highest incarceration rates per capita in the world. Currie, a Republican from Brookhaven, has oversight of Mississippi’s prison system and those who manage it. During a private meeting at the Central Mississippi Correctional Facility in Rankin County with some of these leaders, Currie said Dr. Raman Singh, VitalCore’s chief medical officer, told her and State Health Officer Dr. Daniel Edney that about 5,000 MDOC prisoners and some prison workers had contracted hepatitis C. 
Corrections Commissioner Burl Cain shared the same number with her in a separate meeting, Currie said. 
Singh did not respond to requests for comment.

MDOC and VitalCore did not respond to questions about whether such conversations occurred. Department of Health spokesperson Greg Flynn said Dr. Edney did not believe it would be appropriate to comment on a private conversation, but he said it “absolutely could be the case” that as many as 5,000 people incarcerated in Mississippi suffer from hepatitis C. 
Mississippi Today identified inconsistencies in testing and diagnosis numbers, such as low numbers of tests that resulted in large increases in new diagnoses, obtained through public-records requests. “Data collection and streamlining of the reception and diagnostic unit” contributed to the discrepancies, Head said.

During a series of tours of Mississippi prisons last year, Currie, who is a registered nurse, said she witnessed prisoners suffering from a wide range of health ailments, including hepatitis C, without treatment. The suffering is preventable, and raises questions about how hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars have been spent, she said.
Currie called the denial of hepatitis C medication in Mississippi prisons a “public health crisis” that she couldn’t look away from as a nurse and a Christian. 
“This is morally wrong,” she said. 
A cure to count on
Hepatitis C can be treated with a type of highly effective antiviral medication that cures more than 95% of patients in a matter of weeks. Nonetheless, there are over 10,000 hepatitis C-related deaths in the U.S. each year.
Left untreated, the contagious blood-borne virus can cause serious health problems, including liver disease, liver failure and cancer. It is the leading cause of liver transplants in the U.S. 
Hepatitis C proliferates in state prisons across the country, where its prevalence is nine times greater than the general population. 
Risk factors for hepatitis C, such as injecting drugs, overlap with those for incarceration, said Dr. Anne Spaulding, an associate professor of epidemiology at Emory University’s Rollins School of Public Health who studies hepatitis C in prisons. She formerly served as medical director for the Rhode Island Department of Corrections. 
Spaulding said prisons should make the medication available to every person who wants treatment.
“There should be no reason why a prison can’t treat most of their patients,” Spaulding said.
The first treatment for hepatitis C arrived in the 1980s. But the medication had low success rates and debilitating side effects, including flu-like symptoms, fatigue, depression and suicidal ideation. 
A major scientific advance in the early 2010s – direct-acting antiviral drugs – transformed treatment regimens, offering high cure rates, shorter treatment durations and fewer side effects. 
“The cure is something that you can really count on,” Spaulding said. “So it’s gone from a difficult-to-treat infection to an infection that is much, much simpler and effective (to treat).”
But the breakthrough in treatment has meant little for most Mississippi prisoners with hepatitis C, who have been fighting for years to receive the medication in prison. 
“It is a problem that has been left so long without any answers,” Currie said. 
In 2017, Chad Spiers, then incarcerated at South Mississippi Correctional Institution in Leakesville, filed a lawsuit against the Mississippi Department of Corrections and the medical contractor at the time for denying him medication after he tested positive for hepatitis C. 
Magistrate Judge Robert H. Walker dismissed Spiers’ complaint, ruling that his care was constitutional because, though he did not receive medication, he was monitored for progression of the illness. 
“The Constitution guarantee (sic) prisoners ‘only adequate, not optimal medical care,’” reads the ruling. 
The Department of Corrections’ hepatitis management policy obtained by Mississippi Today says it will provide treatment for people with hepatitis C diagnoses “when indicated.” Spokesperson Head did not respond to questions about which cases warrant treatment. 
But a person with direct knowledge of medical care inside Mississippi’s prisons, who was granted anonymity to speak candidly about how inmates are treated, said prisons are financially incentivized to wait to treat inmates until they get sick enough for prison officials to justify purchasing the expensive medication. 
“(Prison staff) were told he’s not sick enough yet,” the person said. 
The medication can cost the Mississippi system almost $30,000 for a six-week course, the person said. 
However, many state prison systems have negotiated cheaper prices for the medication and are able to treat more patients.
Delaying treatment runs counter to recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Federal Bureau of Prisons, which say clinicians should treat people and not wait for the illness to resolve spontaneously.
The CDC’s guidance should be applied to people who are incarcerated, said Dr. Kate LeMasters, as assistant professor at the University of Colorado who studies the public health implications of the prison system.
Most people with hepatitis C do not have symptoms, and about 25% will spontaneously clear the infection without treatment. The disease is slow moving and can take years for symptoms to show. But left untreated, it can wreak havoc on a person’s immune system, turning their skin yellow from jaundice and causing joint pain that leaves them immobile. Its longer-term health consequences, such as liver failure and cancer, are life-threatening.
“What we do now is that we let them get sick and die, or we let them get so sick that they get a liver disease, cirrhosis or cancer, and they die,” Currie said. 
Disincentives and unused discounts
Even as the price of costly medication has fallen and treatment has become more effective, some state prison systems argue that treating hepatitis C is prohibitively expensive. 
Several states have negotiated innovative payment models to treat people and prevent the spread of the disease inside and outside of prison walls. 
Some use what is called the “Netflix” model – a subscription-based program that gives a state unlimited treatment doses during a fixed period. Other states have negotiated lower costs with pharmaceutical companies or obtained the medication through health care organizations enrolled in the federal 340B program, which requires pharmaceutical companies to sell outpatient drugs at discounted prices. The program can offer discounts on drugs in the range of 20% to 50%. 
In its February 2024 contract proposal, VitalCore wrote it was “confident” it would be able to access discounted prices for hepatitis C medications using the 340B program. 
“We have had tremendous success in accessing 340B purchasing and pricing in other similar contracts for the purpose of purchasing more expensive medications such as those for the treatment of HIV and Hepatitis C,” the proposal reads. 
In the 2025 legislative session, a bill proposed by Currie would have required the Mississippi Departments of Health and Corrections to establish a hepatitis C program for inmates and work to obtain the medication at a discounted price through the 340B program. 
The legislation passed the House with a large bipartisan majority, but didn’t survive negotiations with the Senate, in part because of a disagreement over the bill’s proposed audit of prison health care. 
MDOC and VitalCore did not respond to questions about whether they receive 340B pricing for hepatitis C drugs. University of Mississippi Medical Center, the state’s largest hospital system, did not respond to a request for comment about whether the hospital partners with VitalCore to obtain discounted hepatitis C medication. 
The Department of Health provided MDOC information about how to access 340B pricing several months ago, but the agency has not yet taken steps to obtain the reduced prices, Health Department spokesperson Flynn told Mississippi Today. 
“The Department of Health has given information about how to go about getting 340B pricing and joining the program to the Department of Corrections,” Flynn said. “But to our knowledge, they are not utilizing the 340B, at least not that we know of right now.” 
This means the Corrections Department isn’t making use of the tools it has to purchase hepatitis C medications at a cheaper price, Currie said. 
“They’ve been able to get it all along,” she said.
A fate no one deserves
One study suggests it is most cost-effective to test and treat hepatitis C widely and provide linkage to care when people are released from prison because it prevents expensive complications and limits the spread of the infection. 
“It’s going to cost the taxpayers more because we don’t initially treat it,” Currie said. 
Currie told Mississippi Today she has personally asked the corrections department to treat several people she met while touring the prison system last year. One was “literally about on his deathbed” before receiving treatment, but has shown significant improvement since receiving medication, she said. 
Despite evidence that suggests broad testing and treatment save money in the long run, Mississippi does not test widely for hepatitis C. Testing is performed “when deemed clinically indicated by the healthcare providers,” who take into consideration risk factors and the probability a patient has hepatitis C, Head said. 
Incarceration itself is a risk factor for hepatitis C, given its high prevalence in prisons, LeMasters said. 
“Everyone should be screened when entering prison because people who have a history of incarceration are considered at risk,” she said. 
Opt-out testing, where patients are tested unless they specifically decline it, is the most effective way to identify hepatitis C, Spaulding said. 
Incarcerated people are one of the few groups in the U.S. with a constitutional right to health care. MDOC has told Mississippi Today that it provides health care to prisoners that meets constitutional standards. 
But a former top corrections official, after reading Mississippi Today’s coverage of prison health care issues, turned over internal communications to the news outlet that revealed top prison officials bemoaning the poor medical care provided to prisoners. 
Inside prison facilities, hepatitis C patients are denied lifesaving medication – a fate no one, not even people convicted of crimes, deserves, Currie said. 
“Our whole ‘because you’re in jail, we don’t care if you die’ program really doesn’t work for me,” she said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10114223/mt-prison-health-story3-featimage-03_720.jpg,,,2025-10-13 06:56:19.039528

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Arguments about the First Amendment, which, to many, is the most sacrosanct of the articles in the U.S. Constitution Bill of Rights, are a constant in American democracy. 
Witness how Tennessee’s new buffer zone law demanding journalists stay 25 feet from law enforcement could trip up reporters in Memphis trying to document federal forces— including agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Department of Homeland Security, FBI, U.S. Marshals and Drug Enforcement Administration plus an extra 300 Tennessee Highway Patrol troopers and members of the Tennessee National Guard — occupying the majority Black city by the hundreds.
In the 2025 legislative session, lawmakers passed the measure to establish a 25-foot “buffer zone” that allows law enforcement officers to order members of the media and public to remain 25 feet away from crime scenes, traffic stops and any “ongoing and immediate threat to public safety.”
The bill, sponsored by House Majority Leader William Lamberth, a Portland Republican, and Republican Sen. Mark Pody of Lebanon, creates a Class B misdemeanor for violations of the buffer zone. 
Bill expanding Tennessee law enforcement powers during protests draws pushback

“As you can imagine, journalists appear within 25 feet of law enforcement officers doing their day job every day,” said Grayson Clary, staff attorney with Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press (RCFP,) which provides legal support to journalists. 
Similar laws have been challenged in Indiana and Louisiana, where lawyers with the RCFP have prevailed and obtained preliminary injunctions to enforcement of the laws. 
The Lookout is part of a coalition of Tennessee media outlets and companies, including the Nashville Banner, Gannett, Scripps Media and TEGNA that has sued the state of Tennessee in federal court over the new law. 
“These buffer laws jeopardize reporters’ ability to bring their communities some of the news that matters most — about crime, disaster response, police misconduct, and more,” said Clary, who is representing the media coalition alongside Paul McAdoo, RCFP’s Local Legal Initiative attorney for Tennessee. “When law enforcement pushes the press out of eye and earshot, it’s the public that ultimately loses out.”
On October 3, six Memphis area state lawmakers sent a letter to WHBQ Fox 13, accusing the station of endangering law enforcement officials for airing a link to a tip line. 
Fox 13 asked viewers to let the station know about locations of task force operations and agents as they engaged with detentions and arrests throughout the city, presumably so their reporters and photographers could observe and report on the activities of the Memphis Safe Communities Task Force. 
Sen. Paul Rose, a Shelby County Republican, accused a Memphis TV station of threatening federal law enforcement after Fox 13 posted a tip line. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
This is Journalism 101. Every news outlet worth its salt, including the Lookout, asks readers or viewers to provide story tips. 
Yet, state Sen. Paul Rose, a Covington Republican, seemed to find it unusual. “It is outrageous that a local TV station would work against these efforts by tipping off offenders and endangering the officers sworn to protect us. This irresponsible reporting must stop so law enforcement can do its job without interference,” he said in a press release sent by state House Republican Caucus staff. 
If armed federal law enforcement and Tennessee Highway Patrol officers can’t manage being photographed by TV journalists, they might not be best equipped to deal with the more serious issues of crime they are allegedly in Memphis to handle . Surely, these hundreds of agents aren’t so fragile they need the protection of a handful of state lawmakers. 
This raises the question of why our elected officials would want to call out reporters and imply they are a threat. These are the same lawmakers who often pledge strict allegiance to the Constitution and to smaller government: Rose’s website says he’s a “strong believer in less government,” yet here he is, inserting government into an industry expressly protected by the First Amendment. 
One wonders if Tennessee’s lawmakers don’t understand the Constitution as well as they claim to or if this is another case of overreach by members of the legislature’s supermajority because they can. Either way, the continued treading on free speech and the free press won’t stand: Tennessee’s media outlets, including the Lookout, will continue to bring accountability to the public and uphold the First Amendment.

(Peter Hall/Capital-Star)This article originally appeared on Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment. Sign up for their newsletter here.
Maryland this month finalized a $340 million deal with Constellation Energy to relicense the Conowingo Dam in Cecil County, ending years of litigation and regulatory uncertainty. The agreement restores the state’s authority to enforce water quality standards under the Clean Water Act and sets a possible precedent for dozens of hydroelectric relicensing cases nationwide expected in coming years.
The deal includes direct and associated investments in habitat restoration, trash and debris removal, aquatic life passage and other environmental priorities.
The Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) will have oversight of the agreement, with input from two advocacy groups—Waterkeepers Chesapeake and the Lower Susquehanna Riverkeeper Association—who challenged and helped overturn an earlier settlement they argued was legally and environmentally deficient.
The revised settlement reasserts a 2018 Water Quality Certification that Maryland had previously waived in its 2019 deal with Exelon, the dam’s previous operator. That waiver prompted the advocacy groups to file a legal challenge, leading to a 2023 federal appeals court ruling that tossed the license granted by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). The new agreement binds Constellation, the dam’s current operator, to terms enforceable by both state and federal regulators.
Gov. Wes Moore hailed the agreement as a major step for environmental protection and energy security.
“The Chesapeake Bay is the keystone to Maryland’s prosperity,” Moore said in a statement. “This agreement will lead to real improvements in water quality in the biggest tributary of the Chesapeake Bay, while securing the future of one of our state’s largest clean energy producers. By bringing everyone to the table, we have struck an agreement that is good for the environment, good for energy production, and good for Marylanders.”
Environmental advocates also celebrated the deal as precedent-setting.
“This agreement shows what can be accomplished with the Clean Water Act as it is,” said Evan Isaacson, senior attorney with the Chesapeake Legal Alliance, who represented the environmental groups in the case. “Constellation and all parties are legally bound by the terms of the settlement.”
The Conowingo Dam, located on the Susquehanna River, the Bay’s biggest tributary, has long been a thorny issue in Bay restoration efforts. For more than a decade, advocates maintained that the dam’s reservoir, intended to trap sediment and nutrients flowing downstream, was filled with silt that reduced its effectiveness. During large storm events, massive pollution loads from the reservoir escaped into the Bay, exacerbating reduced oxygen or “dead” zones and upending cleanup goals.
Under the new settlement, Constellation has committed to spending $340 million over the 50-year license term, with restoration efforts focused on areas within Maryland’s side of the Lower Susquehanna watershed. Of the total committed sum, $87.6 million will go to pollution reduction and resiliency projects, including shoreline restoration and planting of underwater grasses that produce oxygen, stabilize sediments and provide habitat for countless species.
Another $77.8 million is allocated for removing trash and debris, while $28 million will go to improving fish and eel passage at the dam. A freshwater mussel hatchery, aimed at natural water filtration, will receive $23.3 million. The settlement also includes funding for invasive species control and other restoration priorities.
Just $18.7 million is designated for dredging studies and related activities. Environmentalists and scientists remain split on whether dredging is the right solution. Studies by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the state of Maryland have found dredging to be expensive—costing billions of dollars over decades—and potentially disruptive to aquatic life.
Still, groups like the Lower Susquehanna Riverkeeper argue that without some removal of the built-up sediment, the dam will remain a significant source of Bay pollution.
In written comments to Inside Climate News, Lower Susquehanna Riverkeeper Ted Evgeniadis said his organization’s appeal of the 2019 license centered on its failure to address the sediment buildup behind the dam. “The dam alters the timing and delivery of sediment and nutrients to the river and Bay by scour events,” Evgeniadis said. “Providing a pathway for dredging was one of our top priorities.”
He described the 2025 agreement as a durable framework with meaningful oversight provisions, particularly in early implementation years. His organization will participate in annual consultations on how the mitigation fund is used, including around dredging. Evgeniadis noted that future federal funding may be needed to cover the costs of actual dredging if it proceeds.
“The agreement provides Maryland with funding to get many different projects done,” he said. “For dredging particularly, there will be a need for future support from the Maryland delegation and/or federal government for funding gaps to get the initial upfront investments going.”
Evgeniadis said his benchmarks for the agreement’s success include expanded biodiversity, increased migratory fish passage and fewer sediment runoff events from the dam, all of which could reduce the frequency and severity of dead zones in the Bay.
But some experts are skeptical that dredging will significantly change the trajectory of Bay cleanup efforts.
Donald Boesch, a leading estuarine scientist and former president of the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science, said the data simply doesn’t support it.
Boesch pointed to the Chesapeake Bay Program’s Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) goals, the pollution diet for the Bay. He noted that 34 million pounds of nitrogen and 1.7 million pounds of phosphorus still need to be reduced from the Susquehanna to meet those targets. By contrast, the estimated impact of sediment buildup behind the dam adds 6 million pounds of nitrogen and 0.3 million pounds of phosphorus to that load.
“Upstream controls are a seven-times bigger challenge,” Boesch said. “The $88 million water-quality portion of the agreement should strive to achieve these offsetting load reductions.”
He said that multiple studies, including those by the Army Corps, have concluded dredging the Conowingo reservoir would be extremely costly and of limited effectiveness. “The agreement includes a further assessment of feasibility and effectiveness, not large-scale dredging per se,” Boesch said.
Despite this long-running disagreement, advocates and experts agreed that the settlement’s most significant feature is the reassertion of Maryland’s authority under Section 401 of the federal Clean Water Act. The clause allows states to place conditions on federally licensed projects to ensure compliance with state water quality standards.
Isaacson, of the Chesapeake Legal Alliance, said the 2019 settlement fell short in part because it attempted to retroactively waive this authority. “The previous attempt to waive the 2018 certification was found to be invalid by a federal appellate court,” he said, implying that the previous settlement left no enforceable mechanism to get the dam owner to fulfill its obligations.
The new agreement, he said, gives Maryland the tools to hold Constellation accountable. “They know MDE, FERC, the Waterkeepers, elected officials and the public are watching, and they know what they publicly committed to,” Isaacson said.
Waterkeepers Chesapeake and the Lower Susquehanna Riverkeeper Association now have a formal role in monitoring compliance, including input on project priorities funded by the settlement. Constellation, which took over dam operations from Exelon in early 2022, is required to maintain a website for public disclosure of non-confidential documents submitted to MDE, while the agency itself will keep a separate webpage dedicated to the dam’s licensing.
Robin Broder, acting executive director of Waterkeepers Chesapeake, said the revised settlement is a major step forward and emphasized the importance of launching restoration projects early. “Many of the payments are frontloaded so projects can be launched early in the license’s term so we begin to see restoration and improvements of fisheries, habitats and water quality as soon as possible,” she said.
Broder said that while the settlement doesn’t impose binding requirements on upstream states like Pennsylvania and New York, where the majority of the Susquehanna’s nutrient pollution originates, it includes a commitment to advocate for stronger conditions in future relicensing of upstream dams such as Holtwood and Safe Harbor.
The Chesapeake Bay Foundation, which was not a party to the settlement but joined legal challenges to the 2019 waiver, also welcomed the new agreement. Paul Smail, the foundation’s vice president for litigation and general counsel, said the revised deal offers stronger environmental commitments and accountability.
“The biggest difference is that the Waterkeepers were not at the negotiation table in 2019,” Smail said. “In this current 2025 agreement, there is more funding available for environmental mitigation projects.”
Smail said Constellation should be held responsible for maintaining sediment levels in the dam’s pool, but stressed that upstream pollution reductions are just as important. “The dam affects how and when sediment and nutrients, particularly phosphorus during sediment scouring events, are released into Chesapeake Bay,” he said. “However, it’s also critical that upstream sources of the sediment and nutrient pollution must be reduced.”
He said the public should expect to see clear deliverables over the first five years, especially on restoration and resiliency projects in the Maryland portion of the watershed. “The actions of the Waterkeepers on behalf of the public, and ongoing citizen enforcement, have been and will continue to be key to accountability,” Smail said.
All parties seem to agree that the Conowingo agreement will serve as a model for how states and citizen groups can shape federal relicensing decisions. Isaacson said the deal sets a precedent in its use of the Clean Water Act to address emerging challenges like sediment scouring due to more frequent extreme storms.
“There will be a lot of major hydroelectric projects coming up for relicensing in the coming years and many of them may share similar issues,” he said. “We secured a major victory here, but there’s no doubt it took a lot of persistence.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_7706-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-13 06:56:19.039528

Why that happened is unclear — state and county officials gave different explanations — but they cautioned that the error would have not resulted in anyone being able to have their vote counted twice.
State and county officials said they have found that a total of 68 potential duplicate mail ballots were mistakenly issued. In some of these cases, they said, the ballots may not have reached voters, as the mistake may have been caught after a second ballot label was generated but before a duplicate ballot was actually mailed to the voter. 
In Luzerne County, in northeast Pennsylvania, 31 voters received duplicate mail ballots, WVIA reported Tuesday. State officials initially said that the problem was isolated to that one county, but acknowledged a small number of other counties experienced similar issues — although potentially for different reasons — after inquiries from Votebeat and Spotlight PA. 
Using publicly available information on mail ballot requests, Votebeat and Spotlight PA identified a few other counties that appeared to have issued duplicate ballots. Election officials in Dauphin, Montgomery, and Carbon counties confirmed that some voters in their counties had been issued or received duplicate mail ballots as well. 
Emily Cook, election director for Luzerne County, told WVIA that the cause was an unknown problem with the state election management system, known as SURE. 
But Jonathan Marks, deputy secretary of the commonwealth, said the duplicate labels were created in a variety of ways, and at least some stemmed from user error as counties tried to fix an issue with the first mail ballot. SURE’s user interface has shortcomings, he acknowledged, and resolving one issue can create another if counties don’t use the ideal method. Marks said the state is looking at how to improve it.
The Department of State said counties sometimes print duplicate labels for other reasons, such as damage to the original label. “A duplicate label’s existence does not automatically mean an error has occurred,” the department said in a statement. 
Both county and state officials stressed that the duplicate ballots have been canceled, and could not be cast or counted. In addition, each ballot return envelope has a unique barcode associated with the voter. When a county receives a ballot back, the code is scanned into the SURE system and it marks the voter as having voted. If a second barcode tied to the same voter were to be scanned, the system would reject the ballot. 
After learning of the duplicate mail ballots in Luzerne, state election officials audited the SURE system to check for any additional duplicates, and found 37 potential cases across seven other counties. 
In Dauphin County, which includes Harrisburg, Election Director Chris Spackman said the county was informed by the department on Tuesday that “a routine internal review of the SURE system” had discovered a single duplicate ballot sent to a Dauphin voter. Spackman added that his deputy was informed by a contractor who helps the department manage the SURE system that the error was the contractor’s, but he knew no other details. 
Megan Alt, a spokesperson for Montgomery County, west of Philadelphia, said the county had notified the state Wednesday morning of a potential duplicate, and workers subsequently discovered three other voters who had received duplicate ballots “as a result of files received from the state’s system.”
Carbon County’s election director, Jennifer Ketchledge, confirmed that her county issued 20 duplicate labels for mail voters. She said the department reached out to her Tuesday and informed her, and the county canceled the additional ballots.
“I have no clue” why it happened, she said, adding that the state was looking into it. 
Even if two mailing labels for ballots are generated for the same voter, Ketchledge said the vendor that handles the county’s mail ballot printing and shipping would catch it before the duplicate ballot was actually sent. 
Cook, the Luzerne election director, did not respond to a request for comment, but county officials told other news outlets the SURE system shouldn’t allow such errors to happen. 
“Assuming that the state’s excuse is accurate, how broken is the SURE system if it cannot safeguard against a county inadvertently sending two labels for the same voter?” Luzerne County Manager Romilda Crocamo told The Citizen’s Voice Wednesday.
“There is nothing sure about the SURE system,” Crocamo added. “The upgrades to SURE system can’t happen soon enough.”
The state said the SURE system’s primary safeguard “is a mechanism that prevents recording more than one ballot per voter in a single election.”

(Higher Ground Women’s Recovery Residence)PENNINGTON GAP, Va. — On a Saturday evening in June, people of this rural region gathered at the historic Lee Theatre to celebrate the founding of Higher Ground Women’s Recovery Residence.
Author Barbara Kingsolver opened the facility in January with royalties from her Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, “Demon Copperhead,” whose plot revolves around Appalachia’s opioid crisis. The home offers a supportive place for people to stay while learning to live without drugs. Kingsolver had asked the women now living there to join her on stage.

Kingsolver, who grew up on the edge of Appalachia in Kentucky’s Nicholas County, suggested the women share with the audience what they were most proud of having gained from their first weeks at Higher Ground. But she learned they were more eager to brag on one another.
Supporters say Higher Ground provides stability and a reentry point after leaving jail, prison, or a treatment center. It offers a range of services and support in an area devastated by addiction to painkilling pills and other types of opioids. Most fundamentally, it’s a true home, with one- and two-person bedrooms, a communal kitchen, and a den. Residents say they have found affirmation from a cohort of women who understand how addiction can demoralize a person and estrange them from family and community.
Ronda Morgan, a resident, said her family has always been in her corner. But while she was serving a jail sentence for drug possession, she told herself, “I’m sick of them having to do time with me.” She was ready for recovery. Her daughter, who’s a nurse, told her about Higher Ground, the first facility of its kind in sprawling, rural Lee County. Morgan learned she could live there for up to two years to gain the footing that had eluded her in three-plus decades of addiction.
What she didn’t anticipate was the kinship she forged with her housemates — among them, Syara Parsell — and with Higher Ground’s staff.
Parsell, 35, one of Higher Ground’s first residents, said that in her time there she’s received help finding employment and enrolling in community college courses.
From the staff and Kingsolver, Parsell said, she has received judgment-free support. “Together,” she said, “we figure it out.”
Traditional treatment facilities typically operate under highly structured medical supervision. Recovery houses, like Higher Ground, offer a more relaxed environment, helping move a resident “toward being an independent, fully functional, self-reliant human being,” said Marvin Ventrell, CEO of the National Association of Addiction Treatment Providers.
“Recovery occurs in the community,” he said. But reentry must be approached delicately. “When addiction occurs with a human being, it also occurs within a family social structure.” If a person in early recovery returns to a family that’s unprepared, that person’s chances of success “are severely diminished.”
For Kingsolver, the opioid crisis became a focal point for what she hoped would be “the great Appalachian novel.” The epidemic “has changed so much of the texture of this place,” devastating families and communities.
Pharmaceutical companies targeted central Appalachia for sales of what they falsely claimed were addiction-resistant prescription opioids. Kingsolver wanted to “cast my net back over all of the extractive industries that have come to this place, taken out what was good, and left behind a mess.”
“The way I put it is, ‘They came to harvest our pain when there was nothing else left,’” she said.

In research for “Demon Copperhead,” she immersed herself in the stories of people who’ve navigated addiction and those who care and advocate for them.
The novel has been an enormous success, having sold more than 3 million copies and earning far more than her previous works. Kingsolver decided to dedicate hundreds of thousands of dollars to address the crisis that has overwhelmed the region where she was raised — and to which she returned full time in 2004.
Again, she set about listening. Drawing on a wide range of expertise, she determined that a women’s recovery home was the wisest investment.
Joie Cantrell works as a public health nurse in harm reduction for the Virginia Department of Health, supporting policies and practices to curb the negative effects of drug use, and serves as Higher Ground’s board chair. She had long recognized the need for just such a home.
“That was the part that was missing,” Cantrell said. Too often, when someone would come out of a treatment facility or incarceration, “we lost them. They fell back into the same old patterns.” She said the region sorely needed a safe, stable environment where women could recalibrate.
By August, the home reached its capacity of seven women. It’s right in town, “which is so important,” Kingsolver said, “because in this part of the country we have no public transportation.”
Parsell has long suffered from social anxieties; drugs were her escape. Here, her housemates embraced her. They’ve offered the support she’d never experienced.
“Every two seconds, someone’s like, ‘Syara’s here!’” she said. “I’m very grateful for it.” If there’s an issue in the house, “one of the seven of us has the solution.”
Four residents are employed outside the home, one is enrolled in community college classes, one is completing her GED with plans to continue her education, and everyone volunteers in the community. Crafting classes are offered. Family members visit.
“They’re living life,” said Subrenda Huff, who was filling in while director Liz Brooks took maternity leave.

Morgan said she accomplished more in a month at Higher Ground than she had in years. That includes applying for identification documents, taking budgeting classes, and seeking permanent housing. It includes sharing upkeep duties in the house.
Such was Kingsolver’s vision. But, she said, “here’s what I didn’t expect: The community embraced this with loving arms. I thought maybe people would say, ‘I don’t want this in my backyard.’”
Most of the furniture was donated. Kingsolver’s quarter-million or so social media followers have been instrumental in that. “But it’s not just book clubs in Switzerland or in California; it’s people in Pennington Gap,” she said. Church groups have donated “quilts, bedside lamps, things to hang on the walls just to make it homey.”
Before the facility opened, local folks volunteered to pull weeds, take down an old fence, and put up a new one. Kingsolver said the well of support “has been just endless. It’s been deep, and loving, and a wonder to see.”
Higher Ground, with only one paid staff member, has estimated yearly operating costs of $120,000, Cantrell said. Residents are charged $50 a week. Ventrell said that fees at other recovery houses vary widely but that $2,500 a month is an approximate average.
“We want them to focus on saving money and paying any restitution or fines they may have from past charges,” Cantrell said. “Some may be focused on repaying child support they may owe.”
Higher Ground receives no federal or state funding. Donations continue to pour in. And Kingsolver recently bought the building next door with plans to open a thrift shop, which would be a source of additional income for the home and offer retail work experience for its residents.
Supporters aspire to open more Higher Ground homes elsewhere in the region.
What these women are gaining, Kingsolver said, “is not just sobriety, but belief in themselves.”

Over the past few months, after municipal employees have clocked out, their work computers have stayed on for a little self-improvement — specifically, overnight updates pushed by the city’s IT team to install Windows 11, the latest version of Microsoft’s operating system (OS).
It’s all to outrun the Tuesday, Oct. 14, deadline, when Windows 10 will reach its “end of support.” After that, computers all over the globe that still run Windows 10 will cease receiving “technical assistance, feature updates and security updates,” in Microsoft’s words. For government IT departments, it’s not an option to run fleets of computers sans the latest security tweaks, especially since they’re connected to a city’s most vital functions.
To stay secure, Microsoft recommends upgrading machines to Windows 11. Because of hardware limitations, many cannot. The other options are to pay Microsoft for extended security updates, or to leave the machines in the past and hope for the best. 
Budget documents from the past two years show scattered evidence of local government officials scrambling to address the changeover to Windows 11.
The Community College of Rhode Island asked for $1.17 million in its fiscal year 2025 budget request to replace faculty and staff laptops and PCs which couldn’t be upgraded. The Rhode Island Office of the Public Defender noted in its fiscal year 2026 budget request that its technology ask was 7.38% higher than for 2025 partially because it needed Windows 11-compatible replacements. A March 2024 budget presentation in Jamestown suggested the island town needed $33,600 to swap out its old computers which couldn’t run Windows 11.
The Rhode Island Ethics Commission also received an additional $97,443 in its tech coffer for fiscal year 2025, but the quasi-public agency’s executive director Jason Gramitt wrote in an Oct. 9 email that most of that money went toward a new case management system. The new Windows 11 workstations only cost $8,179 in comparison, Gramitt wrote. 
Pawtucket has largely avoided these expensive options as most of its existing PCs could be upgraded “in place,” said Hersh Cristino, Pawtucket’s chief information and innovation officer, in a recent phone interview. The few machines which couldn’t join the future could be repurposed as “not mission critical” hardware, he added.
“You know, like, ‘Oh yeah, I’m doing a training. Somebody needs to grab a laptop,’” Cristino said. 
Governments have less flexibility than private industry when it comes to big upgrades, Cristino said. He sketched a hypothetical scenario: “You’re in the middle of taking a tax payment, and then you need to upgrade the person’s machine. ‘Oh, sorry. Come back in an hour.’” 
“The challenge is always downtime,” Cristino said, which is why Pawtucket’s IT team — which manage the city’s municipal computers as well those in its school district —  have used the nighttime to minimize possible annoyance for non-IT staff. The upgrade process involves creating a configuration profile with Windows 11, which is then deployed and loaded onto PCs in small batches nightly. Each upgrade usually takes a little over an hour, Cristino said, and the refreshed machines are ready for city workers when they return in the morning. 
Cristino, who took over the city’s IT department in 2012, said the upgrade process this time around has been gentle on installers and users alike. When it comes to mass upgrades, problems can arise “any time you move somebody’s cheese,” Cristino said. Staff can be disoriented by the sudden changes that updates can bring to their work PCs, like relocated taskbars or different menus. 
But the Windows 11 rollout is not as dramatic as transitions in the past: “It’s one of those kinds of upgrades where you look, and you don’t even notice for the most part that you’ve upgraded,” Cristino said. 
Phillip Carlucci, the IT director in Warwick, is likewise unfazed by the upgrade process in his city hall. 
“Just another technology project,” Carlucci wrote in an email. “Fairly routine.”
About 500 Warwick machines were still running Windows 10 at the end of September, but Carlucci was confident the process would be finished by the deadline.

Long lead time to prepare
The deadline to upgrade was no surprise. Windows 10 hit the market in July 2015 and, like most versions of Microsoft’s iconic OS, it became a mainstay of homes, businesses and governments. But the end was officially nigh when, in April 2023, Microsoft announced Windows 10’s end of support.Windows 11 was released in October 2021 and only overtook Windows 10 in popularity in March 2025, according to StatCounter, a website which estimates market share and OS usage through web browser-collected data.
Upgrading to Windows 11 is free on compatible machines, so a tech budget won’t need to stretch much to accommodate Windows 11 if a town or agency’s computers are relatively modern. \
But unlike its older siblings, Windows 11 is pickier about its playmates. It will only install and run on a machine that fulfills a heavier slate of security requirements related to its processor, firmware, and the inclusion of something called the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0, which is typically a hardware chip installed on a computer’s motherboard. Many older machines lack this chip and it is usually unfeasible or outright impossible to add one.
Jim Silveria, Providence’s director of Information Technology, said in a recent phone interview that after about a year and a half of upgrades, the capital city’s move to Windows 11 was “99% complete.” The city was able to allocate some of its American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds before they evaporated to help the Windows 11 transition, Silveria said. 
Any machines not able to be upgraded by Tuesday’s cutoff — “stragglers,” Silveria called them — would be severed from the city’s network. Sometimes, peripherals or specific software used by governments can further complicate the process, as software vendors may not have updated certain programs in a long time, leaving them incompatible with Windows 11. In Providence, one of the machines that may have its internet privileges revoked is a receipt printer used in the Recorder of Deeds’ office.
“It’s been in use for at least 10 years,” Silveria said. “We weren’t able to find a driver.”
So far, so good
The upgrade process has gone relatively smoothly in Rhode Island — at least according to IT officials willing to be interviewed by Rhode Island Current. 
Cranston finished its upgrade in about three months, swapping out any computers that couldn’t make the move upward, according to city spokesperson Zack DeLuca. Bristol Municipal Operations Manager Eric Dickervitz wrote in a recent email that the town had no more devices on Windows 10, as it “routinely upgrade[s]” its equipment. 
Even a small town like New Shoreham, the sole municipality on Block Island, is feeling ready. The town lacks a dedicated in-house IT team and uses a managed service provider, Town Manager Amy Land said in a recent email. “The town doesn’t have any concerns about the Windows 10 end of life,” Land said.

But a number of municipalities did not respond to multiple requests for interviews from Rhode Island Current. Two municipalities — East Providence and Middletown — did respond but without specifics. 
“The Town of Middletown and its School Department have been well aware of the upcoming situation with Windows 10 and have a solid plan in place that we believe will address the transition without any interruptions to our staff, residents and businesspeople,” Matt Sheley, a town spokesperson, wrote over email.
East Providence spokesperson Matthew Paddock, meanwhile, wrote, “The City of East Providence is currently in the process of updating our operating systems to Windows 11, maintaining industry standard.”
At the state level, as of Oct. 2, only 27 computers still needed upgrades. The process moved quickly, as evidenced by an earlier count from Aug. 20 which counted 1,247 computers in need of upgrades.
Brian Tardiff, Rhode Island’s chief information officer and head of the Division of Enterprise Technology Strategy and Services (ETSS), said the state handled procurement centrally and purchased about 4,620 new devices to replace machines that couldn’t run Windows 11, an investment totalling about $3.4 million. 
No grants or federal funds were used for these purchases, and anything that didn’t need to be replaced was upgraded in place. The Windows 11 upgrades even got a shoutout from Gov. Dan McKee in his fiscal year 2025 budget, which allocated $4.8 million from the Information Processing Internal Service Fund for IT-related expenses.

Consumers have limited options
While governments have little choice in whether to upgrade, consumers are on their own. They can also squeeze a little more life out of their Windows 10 machines with Microsoft’s Extended Security Updates.
In an unsigned Oct. 9 email, a Microsoft spokesperson called these updates a “short-term bridge” while people move to Windows 11. Customers can get the extended updates for a year if they sync their PC settings with the company’s cloud service, Windows Backup, or if they redeem 1,000 Microsoft Rewards points. The coverage will run from Oct. 15, 2025, to Oct. 13, 2026. 
Customers can also pay $30 for the extended support. For cities, schools and other organizations, Microsoft will charge $61 per device for the first year of extended updates. The updates can be renewed for up to three years, with price increases each year. 
On Sept. 25, Microsoft budged slightly and decided to allow consumers in the European Economic Area to receive a free year’s worth of extended updates for Windows 10, no backup required.
The push to charge U.S. consumers for continued, secure access to otherwise functional computers they own is problematic for the Public Interest Research Group (PIRG), an environment-focused consumer advocacy nonprofit with local affiliates in multiple states, including Rhode Island. PIRG recently estimated that roughly 40% of current Windows 10 devices won’t be able to upgrade globally. That could eventually generate 1.6 billion pounds of e-waste, in the group’s estimate. 
“We just think this is absurd from a consumer point of view,” Henry Welch, a campaign associate with PIRG’s Right to Repair, said. Welch works on PIRG campaigns primarily in Rhode Island and Maine. “We’re especially worried about the effect that the end of Windows 10 would have on consumers and the environment in general.”
The options available to Windows 10 consumers are all suboptimal, in PIRG’s view. The tough choices will largely fall upon people already using more affordable devices, PIRG says, as they might not be able to acquire new machines. 
“It’s totally possible for them to extend security updates for at least a year,” Welch said. “I mean, they’re doing it in Europe already.”
PIRG is pressing Microsoft to do the same in the U.S. The group sent a letter to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella with 590 signatories asking Microsoft to do so. While PIRG will not release the list publicly, the advocacy organization said the list includes Rhode Island signees, including James Frame, owner of South County Computers in Wakefield, who commented on the Windows 11 transition in a PIRG press release. 
“We were regularly installing it [Windows 10] on customers’ computers until less than a year ago, as we considered it more stable and tried-and-true than Windows 11,” Frame said. “If it ain’t broke, don’t outdate it.”
Welch said that when he’s campaigned in rural parts of Maine, he’s encountered many people “running, really, really older versions of Windows on older laptops.”  The “very steep hardware upgrades” needed for Windows 11 like the TPM 2.0 are part of how innovation “is leaving some of these less technologically savvy people behind,” Welch said.

Pawtucket’s Cristino said his city may purchase a handful of extended support updates for Windows 10 PCs that can’t make the move.
“You never know if Microsoft next week is gonna say, ‘Yeah, no, we’re gonna extend [the deadline] a little longer,” Cristino joked.
But Microsoft will not: “After October 14, 2025, Microsoft will no longer provide security and feature updates or technical support for Windows 10,” the company’s spokesperson wrote to Rhode Island Current on Oct. 9 in an unsigned email.
The spokesperson steered customers toward trade-in and recycling programs through Microsoft and its partners for devices that can’t be upgraded, and noted the company’s goal of “becoming carbon negative, water positive, and zero waste by 2030.” 
But PIRG predicts the waste will multiply. In its letter to Microsoft’s Nadella , the group argued, “The end of free Windows 10 support will cause widespread damage to the environment and cybersecurity,” with “hundreds of millions of devices” destined for either obsolescence or the landfill.
In the Ocean State, those items may end up with the Rhode Island Resource Recovery Corporation (RIRRC), which runs the state’s Central Landfill in Johnston and also serves as a collection site for the state’s e-waste program. In 2024, the Johnston e-waste collection site logged 84,517 pounds of covered electronics, all of it destined for manufacturer-funded recycling programs. 



Do I need to upgrade my operating system?
Why should I upgrade from Windows 10 anyway? Because of their ubiquity, Windows systems have long been the biggest target for malware and other bad actors. Most malicious scripts are written for Windows, and years of backwards compatibility and the wide array of apps and drivers on Windows widen the possibilities for attack. Improvements like TPM — or Trusted Platform Module, which ensures when a system starts up that it hasn’t been tampered with — harden Windows against bad actors, but cyberthreats develop almost in lockstep with security measures. 
“Microsoft understands that moving to a new PC can take time, and there are multiple options to choose from,” the company recommended through a spokesperson. “For devices that are eligible to upgrade to Windows 11, they strongly encourage the upgrade as this will give the  highest security for the device.”

First, check to see if your Windows PC can upgrade: The PC Health Check App can quickly identify whether your Windows computer needs an upgrade. If you’re curious about the specs, Windows 11 requires TPM 2.0, UEFI/Secure Boot, and a modern CPU and RAM. If your computer was made in the last five years, it probably qualifies. You may need to turn on TPM 2.0.
If you can’t upgrade and need more time: You can enroll in Windows’ Extended Support Updates. Coverage will run from Oct. 15, 2025, to Oct. 13, 2026. To continue receiving updates, your options include:

Syncing your PC settings with Microsoft’s cloud service, Windows Backup, at no additional cost
Redeeming 1,000 Microsoft Rewards points
Paying $30, plus any additional taxes.

Microsoft 365 Apps get a longer runway: Desktop apps like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, OneNote, Access, and Publisher will get security updates on Windows 10 until Oct. 10, 2028, but the underlying OS won’t, so plan accordingly. 
I bought a new PC. What do I do with my old one? The Rhode Island Resource Recovery Corporation website includes plenty of information, broken down by municipality, on how to recycle old computers. Microsoft also recommends trade-in and recycling programs are available through through its trusted partners, including Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Samsung, or at retailers like Best Buy and Walmart. Business customers can access similar services through resellers like Bechtle, CDW, ComputaCenter, Connection, and SHI, Microsoft said.

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)The U.S. Supreme Court recently heard oral arguments in Chiles v. Salazar, a case that could significantly change how states protect LGBTQIA+ youth. The issue is whether states can ban licensed mental health professionals from subjecting children to so-called “conversion therapy.”
From the questioning, most justices seem ready to strike down these bans, arguing that conversion therapists are simply engaging in protected speech with their clients.
That framing is dangerously incomplete. Licensed professionals such as therapists, doctors and lawyers are not ordinary speakers. When we earn a professional license, we also accept restrictions on our speech during practice. These restrictions exist for a reason: Words can cause serious harm when spoken with professional authority.
Supreme Court justices skeptical of free speech limits in Colorado conversion therapy case

If a doctor advises a patient to drink bleach to cure a cold, or a lawyer counsels a client to commit perjury, neither can hide behind the First Amendment. Professional speech is held to standards of competence and ethics because the stakes involve life, liberty and health.
The same holds true in mental health practice. Conversion therapy is not a harmless exchange of ideas between equals. It is based on the discredited belief that LGBTQIA+ identities are disorders to be fixed. All major medical and mental health organizations, including the American Psychiatric Association, the American Psychological Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics, have condemned conversion therapy as ineffective, unethical and harmful. These groups warn that the practice raises the risks of depression, substance abuse, family rejection and suicide. Conversion therapy is a form of psychological abuse, particularly when forced upon minors.
State regulation of professional practice is well established. States regularly define limits on what licensed professionals can and cannot do. We prevent doctors from prescribing unsafe or unproven treatments. We discipline lawyers who provide fraudulent or harmful advice.
Therapists are also required to follow standards that mandate evidence-based practices and prioritize client safety. Conversion therapy fails these standards, and states have both the right and obligation to protect children from it.
The court’s apparent willingness to prioritize the free speech rights of practitioners over the health and safety of minors overlooks that balance. The First Amendment has never been an absolute shield against professional responsibility. Treating it as such would lead to a cascade of unintended consequences. If speech alone were the standard, what would prevent a financial advisor from selling fraudulent schemes under the guise of “speech?” What would stop a physician from prescribing quack remedies with no scientific backing? Regulation of professions has always required more than blind deference to free expression.
The consequences of overturning these bans will be severe. Children themselves rarely seek conversion therapy. It is imposed on them by parents or guardians, often influenced by religious or ideological groups. These young people do not give informed consent before attending therapy. They are forced into sessions that promote shame and self-hatred. 
Research indicates that LGBTQIA+ young adults who faced high levels of family rejection are more than eight times as likely to attempt suicide compared to their peers from supportive families. Loosening state bans now would risk exploitation by professionals under the guise of constitutional liberty.
The court should avoid oversimplifying this issue as merely a conflict between free speech and censorship. The case involves professional standards, public safety, and the legitimate role of the state in preventing harm. Personal opinions belong in the public square where disagreement is protected. However, when a licensed professional advises a client, that speech is not just free expression but professional conduct with ethical duties and legal limits. Ignoring this distinction risks enabling harm and diminishes the authority of states to protect vulnerable youth.
The First Amendment deserves robust protection, but not at the expense of children’s lives. The Constitution should not be distorted into a weapon that protects malpractice.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/conversion-therapy-SCOTUS.jpeg,,,2025-10-13 05:57:00.125701

(Photos courtesy of campaigns)Six years after they first squared off, Republican Del. Carrie Coyner and Democrat Lindsey Dougherty are headed for a high-stakes rematch in Virginia’s House District 75 — a once-reliably Republican seat that voted for Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election and has since become one of the most closely watched battlegrounds statewide.
Coyner, a Chesterfield attorney and former school board member who won the newly drawn district by about five points in 2023, spent the last week fielding national attention tied to 2022 text messages from Democratic attorney general nominee Jay Jones — messages Jones sent to Coyner and later apologized for after they became public this month.
 

Key races: 2025 Virginia House of Delegates elections
• Democrat Mehta aims to unseat Republican Earley in Chesterfield-based House District 73 race
• Growth, tourism and turnout collide in House District 71 rematch
• House District 97, anchored in Virginia Beach, could determine party majority in House of Delegates
• Big money, tight margins define Obenshain–Franklin rematch in House District 41



The episode rippled through Virginia’s statewide races and thrust Coyner, usually known for K-12 policy and housing wonkery, into a national storyline.
Dougherty, a senior research administrator at Virginia Commonwealth University and the 2019 Democratic nominee in the area’s previous configuration, is pitching herself as a kitchen-table problem solver focused on health care affordability, special education, and mental-health access — themes she says cut across Hopewell, Prince George and Chesterfield alike.
Today’s District 75 stitches together the city of Hopewell with portions of Chesterfield and Prince George counties. After the Supreme Court of Virginia redrew legislative maps in 2021, the seat’s electorate diversified and trended younger, and Democrats made gains. In 2024, Harris carried the district 52.3% to 46.2% for Republican Donald Trump, part of a broader blue swing in Chesterfield that helped make suburban seats more competitive.
Money underscores the stakes. Through late summer, the Virginia Public Access Project lists Coyner with roughly $846,580 raised this cycle and Dougherty with about $490,902.
 Carrie Coyner

A self-described education realist who came up through the Chesterfield School Board, Coyner says her legislative compass hasn’t changed since she first ran.
“My passion for public education has stayed at the forefront of all of my public service,” she told The Mercury in a recent interview. “I originally got into public service on the school board, because I was passionate about improving the quality of education for every child, regardless of your zip code.”
On committee work, she argues Education, General Laws (Housing Subcommittee) and Appropriations are where she delivers for her district.
“Sitting on (the) education committee, (I can) be a voice about keeping us focused on our primary role, which is providing the highest quality education to kids,” she said. 
She also called herself “the lead voice on housing policies,” using 25 years in real estate law to flag well-intended bills with “unintended bad consequences.” 
In Appropriations, she said much of the work is “ahead of time behind the scenes,” adjusting proposals before costs cascade.
Coyner has been a principal architect for the Virginia Literacy Act and follow-on measures. The 2022 law shifted Virginia toward science-of-reading instruction, funded reading specialists and directed the state to support district rollouts. 
In 2024, lawmakers approved a Coyner bill tightening VLA provisions and barring three-cueing in reading curricula. “We learned from (other states) how to do it better,” she said, arguing the full benefits will phase in over several years.
Coyner also pointed to special-education work, including professional development requirements for general-education teachers working with students with disabilities, and criticized Democrats for not fully funding training “at one time.” 
On teacher retention, she opposed extending year-long substitute assignments, saying they heap burden on veteran staff; she favors recruiting retirees part-time and offering tuition assistance to math and science majors who agree to teach. 
She further touted a new guarantee that high-school students can take “passport” dual-enrollment courses for free — in person or via community colleges — to lower costs and ease staffing gaps.
Housing is Coyner’s second plank. In the interview, the Republican said she is planning to refile a proposal to create an emergency fund serving “up to 5,000 families with school-age children” to prevent displacement during the school year. “It improves educational outcomes,” she said, by keeping kids in stable classrooms. 
And on the development front, she argues a better environmental balance is possible — newer subdivisions built to modern storm-water rules shouldn’t mean clear-cut neighborhoods, and “affordable” must be understood as a sliding scale across incomes to avoid concentrating poverty.
Industrial permitting and public health remain sensitive around Hopewell, which includes 16,000 registered voters — roughly 27% of all the voters in the district. 
Coyner called manufacturing “the backbone” of the local economy — her grandparents worked in it — but stressed air and water protections and regular talks with DEQ. When the Hopewell wastewater plant spilled sewage into the James River this summer, Coyner said she “immediately got involved” in understanding what failed and how to prevent a repeat. The district is also watching an air-permit fight involving the AdvanSix chemical facility, a case that has drawn environmental-group petitions and federal review.
On abortion, with a constitutional amendment advancing on first reference this year, Coyner frames Democrats’ proposal as overly broad.
“If you look at what has been brought forward, it is the most expansive abortion bill ever brought anywhere, period,” she said, adding she hasn’t met voters backing policies like abortions “up until the moment of birth” or minors’ access “without … talk[ing] to their parents.”
The proposed constitutional amendment’s language does not draw a precise “week-limit” cut-off. Rather, it authorizes the state to regulate abortions in the third trimester only under conditions that preserve exceptions when medically necessary or when viability is lacking.
Democrats counter that their measure would largely codify existing law, protect contraception, miscarriage care and IVF, and update later-term standards under medical necessity — a fight expected to return next session before any ballot question goes to voters.
On public safety, Coyner highlighted a partnership she helped broker with the nonprofit Real Life and local police to dispatch outreach teams after shootings, defuse retaliation and connect neighbors with services. She said it has cut “gang and group-related violence” significantly, with a domestic-violence prevention push next.
Politically, Coyner’s bottom-line contrast is simple.
“For my district, I’ve got results,” she said. “My policies try to get government out of your life when you don’t need it, and to keep more money in your pockets.”
She declined hypotheticals about losing: “I’m choosing not to think that’s a possibility.”
 Lindsey Dougherty

The Democrat’s pitch starts with her résumé and her household budget. A VCU senior research administrator who manages NIH and NSF grants, Dougherty said federal turbulence affects families like hers directly.
“This is not the first, but the second time that this president’s kind of chaotic approach to governing is directly impacting my ability to provide for my family,” she said in a recent interview, recalling a COVID-era furlough from a Chesterfield County budget job in 2020. 
“Across my district, we have a lot of federally funded workers. There’s just a lot of fear and uncertainty about how families are going to survive.”
Her “north star” as a would-be lawmaker, she said, is health care accessibility and affordability. Both of her children have complex autoimmune disorders, and she described long waits for specialists followed by stress over the bills.
“Similar to what was done in 2020 to cap the cost of insulin in Virginia, we can look at other ways to cap prescription drug costs for life-giving medications,” Dougherty said. She’d lean on state insurance regulators and her budgeting background to prioritize relief in the state plan.
On mental health, Dougherty points to school-based care, homeless services and better coordination among agencies using state and federal dollars. She called the shortage of crisis beds and strain on local systems “fixable with focus,” but said the state must avoid passing along unfunded mandates.
Workforce and higher-ed access are another priority. Dougherty wants to expand pathways through community colleges and skilled-trades programs so “good-paying jobs” don’t require a four-year degree.
“We have this really great community college system that we can tap into,” she said, arguing programs should match local employers so graduates “are able to stay in the communities that they live in.”
On K-12, she speaks as a parent who fought for proper Individualized Education Programs (IEPs). 
“It took me years to get my son an IEP at all,” she said, then “an additional year and a half” to secure needed accommodations. She wants staffing boosted and the state funding formula updated — particularly for rural divisions and special education — to ease overcrowding and burnout.
Housing is where Dougherty draws a sharp contrast with her opponent, favoring stronger tenant protections and state help for first-time buyers while urging localities to diversify housing types.
“I firmly believe that we need to provide tenant rights in addition to landlord rights,” she said, adding that Chesterfield “pretty much only (builds) large houses right now” while seniors and young families need attainable options. She links affordability to wages and child-care costs: “We really just need to look at everything holistically.”
On environmental health, Dougherty says Hopewell has been “disproportionately impacted” by industry and that fines alone aren’t sufficient deterrents when air or water permits are violated. She pointed to sewage spills and air-permit disputes as reasons to pair job retention with tougher monitoring and enforcement.
“There’s no reason why we can’t find a middle ground that works for everybody,” she said.
The debate echoes a controversy unfolding in the district, where Dominion Energy’s proposal for a new natural gas–fired plant in Chesterfield has drawn sharp opposition from environmental groups and residents concerned about pollution and public health, while business leaders and some local officials defend it as vital for grid reliability and job creation. 
The project, now under state review, has become a flashpoint in Virginia’s broader struggle to balance industrial growth with climate and air-quality goals.
Dougherty also backs “commonsense gun safety,” including limits on assault-style firearms and location rules for dealers near schools.
“I’m not against the Second Amendment,” she said, “but when we have our kids dying at a disproportionate rate, we need to look at ways to just keep our communities safer.”
On the reproductive rights amendment, Dougherty said she supports enshrining protections in the constitution and frames it as clarity and stability for families and providers.
Politically, she argues the felt difference will be in day-to-day costs:
“There are very tangible ways that the General Assembly can positively impact people’s lives every day,” she said. “If I’m going to pick one key piece, it’s the affordability and accessibility of health care.”
Dougherty also jabbed Coyner’s record as too aligned with GOP leadership, saying “she shows up to community events” but doesn’t vote for the district’s needs in Richmond. Her own strategy to overcome incumbency reprises 2019 and includes relentless door-knocking, coalition building and telling her family’s story to Republicans, independents and Democrats alike.
In District 75, the map, money and mood suggest a fall race decided at the margins — a test of whether Harris-district math and Democratic energy can out-organize an incumbent with a record on education policy and deep community ties. 
What’s certain is that voters in this district will hear sharply different emphases on schools, health care and housing — and conflicting diagnoses of what “affordability” means in a fast-changing suburban-industrial district along the James.
Virginia’s 75th House District includes parts of Chesterfield and Prince George counties as well as the city of Hopewell — a mix of suburban and industrial communities that has become one of the state’s most competitive legislative battlegrounds. (Map courtesy of the Virginia Public Access Project)

RICHMOND, Va. — Northampton and Accomack counties launched a new program in late August that will help public high school students prepare for a career in the aerospace industry.
The Aerospace Academy of the Eastern Shore Lab School will provide students with networking skills, portfolio development, and experiential learning opportunities as they engage in regional aerospace initiatives.
Eastern Shore Community College and Old Dominion University are the higher education partners. Chincoteague, Northampton, Arcadia and Nandua high schools are the K-12 partners.
Students can participate all four years of high school. Freshmen and sophomores take cyber, engineering and computer science classes at the high schools, and juniors and seniors take courses at ESCC.
Once the students become juniors and seniors, the program provides two options for students. Students who take the Aerospace Engineering and Explorations route will earn an associate degree and those who pursue Aerospace Technology will receive a technician certificate.
Students will also learn about engineering fundamentals, entrepreneurship and computer science skills, in addition to gaining college math and English credits. Community college students will also have the opportunity to take aerospace courses.
“It’s a very exciting opportunity for not just the students that get to experience it, but the schools and the community around it,” said Rachel White, Aerospace Academy of the Eastern Shore program executive director.
Virginia students are chosen by a lottery system because of legislation the state approved, according to White. The first 50 students that enter into the lottery get accepted. Extra students are added to the waitlist and their acceptance is determined by the date and time they apply. AAES will add more students to the program in January 2026 if spots are available.
The academy is at the right location, according to White. NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility is on the Eastern Shore and hosts the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport and the new Rocket Lab Launch Complex.

“It’s such a booming area, and the school divisions creating a pipeline for students to be able to just directly go into the field, I think, is ideal,” White said.
The launch of the academy is an incredible opportunity for Virginia, according to Gary Skeen, associate director for the Center of Education Innovation and Opportunity at Old Dominion University.
“Really Old Dominion University is creating a full K-12 STEM pipeline and really trying to position ourselves as the STEM capital of the East Coast,” Skeen said.
ODU has four college partnership lab schools and are fiscal partners with five more, according to Skeen. Faculty members help train and write the curriculums.
“The space industry is currently at a point where it’s really growing,” Skeen said. “It’s really becoming a moving part of the economy across the nation.”
Although the aerospace workforce is slated to grow in coming years, federal cuts have impacted NASA. Over 2,100 senior ranking staff employees agreed to leave NASA through federal administration efforts to trim the federal workforce, according to a July Politico report. NASA currently employs almost 18,000 civil servants, according to its website.
“We need many students pursuing careers in the aerospace industry,” said Karen Sanzo, executive director for the ODU Center of Education Innovation and Opportunity. “I think in Virginia, it is going to be a thriving industry.”
Students participating in the academy will have the chance to complete a Virginia Community College System passport program, which is a set of course blocks designed to satisfy lower-division general education requirements at state public colleges and universities.
The program opens a gateway to the future, Gov. Glenn Youngkin stated in a press release.
“These students will be immersed in Virginia’s aerospace sector and launch into careers that will shape the skies and beyond,” Youngkin stated. “Our mission since day one has been not only to prepare students for the future, but to empower them to lead it.”

(Photo by Sarah Silbiger/Getty Images)Ohio reproductive rights providers and advocates are keeping an eye on federal discussions about a longtime FDA-approved drug used in medication abortion, while maintaining a resolute message in a state with constitutional protections for abortion.
The head of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has indicated he wants the federal Food and Drug Administration to re-review pills used in abortion procedures for safety and effectiveness.
Mifepristone has been FDA-approved since September 2000, and the first generic version was approved in April 2019. Just last month, the FDA approved another generic form of the medication.
Patricia Zettler, a law professor at Ohio State University who studies the FDA, said the request for a new review seems unusual, and it’s also unusual considering drug companies including those that make mifepristone are required to participate in a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy program, which the FDA uses to “help ensure the benefits of the medication outweigh its risks.”
According to the FDA, the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy for mifepristone require that the drug be prescribed by a qualified health care provider, that the patient sign a patient agreement form explaining the risks of the treatment and that the drug be distributed by a certified pharmacy.
“The mifepristone REMS programs is a closed system, meaning prescribers, pharmacies and distributors are certified or authorized and verified under the REMS prior to distribution or dispensing of the drug,” according to the FDA.
But Zettler said because of abortion rights (and anti-abortion rights) movements in individual states and moves like HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s to ask for renewed scrutiny, the drug has been “getting a lot of attention.”
“Policy preferences are generally not permissible when we’re talking about drug approval,” Zettler said.

Medication abortion is typically done with a combination of mifepristone and misoprostol.
It has often been a choice for those without easy access to reproductive clinics or without reliable transportation to get to an appointment.
It’s also considered a less-invasive alternative to surgical abortion.
The newest annual abortion report from the Ohio Department of Health showed medication abortions were used in more than 13,000 abortions in the state, representing more than 46% of all reported abortions in 2024.
A total of 196 post-abortion complications were reported in the 21,829 abortions conducted in Ohio, according to state data.
No deaths were reported in 2024.
In testimony before an Ohio House committee discussing a bill related to abortion funding, Ohio State epidemiology professor Dr. Alison Norris, spoke on the effectiveness of the drug.
Norris is also a co-principal investigator for the Ohio Policy Evaluation Network, a group of academic researchers who study abortion and contraception developments and impacts.
Norris told legislators during the committee hearing that more than 100 peer-reviewed studies over 25 years “create a strong scientific evidence-base to show mifepristone is safe.”
“Scientific consensus is that serious adverse events amongst users of Mifepristone occur less than 0.03% of the time,” Norris said.
Norris also pointed to research using CDC data that showed more likelihood of maternal death in childbirth than in abortion.
The American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists also used the information in saying abortion is a “safe medical intervention.”
“The risk of complication or mortality from abortion is less than the same risk from common procedures like wisdom tooth removal, cancer-screening colonoscopy and plastic surgery,” the group said on its website.
The group went further to say that restricting access to abortion “forces some pregnant people to continue their pregnancies to delivery, leaving them to face the many health risks associated with pregnancy and childbirth.”
Ohioans are facing the risk of restricted access to reproductive care in some areas, with the closure of southwest Ohio Planned Parenthood clinics, and staffing reductions in the Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio clinics, which the facilities said were due to cuts to federal Medicaid funding and other federal resources.
Despite the closures and workforce limitations, Ohio clinics have encouraged clients to use telehealth for care (abortion and otherwise).
Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio announced a plan to expand medication abortion services in Mansfield in September.
“Medication abortion is a safe and effective option for ending a pregnancy,” said Dr. Bhavik Kuma, chief medical officer for the greater Ohio affiliate, in a statement.
“Planned Parenthood will always follow evidence-informed standards and medical best practices to provide safe, high-quality abortion care and information to patients who come to us.”
Even with a request from the HHS secretary to once again review the medication abortion drug, the process is time-consuming, according to Zettler.
It would include reviewing evidence, assessing whether a different determination can be made about the drug, and about whether the benefits outweigh the risks, she said.
“So, the most important takeaway from this for states is that nothing has changed,” Zettler said. “Nothing’s going to change tomorrow and nothing’s changed today.”

Alander Rocha/Georgia RecorderA unique off-year election for two seats on the Georgia Public Service Commission, a body responsible for regulating utilities in the state, has Republicans vocally concerned, especially considering concurrent municipal elections that they worry could favor Democratic mobilization.
District 3 Public Service Commissioner Fitz Johnson. Alander Rocha/Georgia Recorder
Early voting starts Tuesday for the Nov. 4 election, which will decide the fate of two incumbent Republican commissioners on the PSC — Tim Echols of District 2 and Fitz Johnson of District 3 — who are being challenged by Democratic candidates Alicia Johnson and Peter Hubbard, respectively. Fitz Johnson was appointed to the seat by Gov. Brian Kemp in 2021. 
With the races operating outside the typical presidential or midterm election cycles, attention is low and local municipal races could inadvertently dictate the outcome of the statewide PSC contests, according to experts. 
Democrats are also hoping frustration over rising electricity bills will help motivate voters to turn out, with both Democratic candidates campaigning on utility affordability. 
Republicans appear to be ramping up efforts to energize their base. Republican Gov. Brian Kemp recently headlined a campaign event in Cumming for the Republican incumbents. Signs at the event said “Don’t Dem the lights in Georgia.” 
Josh McKoon, the chairman of the Georgia Republican Party, said there was significant concern about Republican voter engagement in the PSC races. He said this election is important for two reasons: the PSC’s role in ensuring reliable energy, which is the “backbone” of Georgia’s economy, and the need to prevent the Democratic Party from gaining a “crack in the door” to the state’s governance.
“We have got to wake people up,” he said.

McKoon encouraged early voting, saying that “the more early voting we have, the easier it’s going to be to finish the drill and win this election.” He described the election as a “close election” in a “competitive state.” 
At the top of his speech, Kemp signaled his concerns about low Republican turnout and suggested that apprehension over the coming election drove first lady Marty Kemp to start wearing a shirt with the word “pray” on it. 
“You hardly even see (Peter Hubbard and Alicia Johnson) out there shaking any hands, asking anybody for a vote. They’re hoping nobody pays attention to this race. They don’t even want people to know that there is a race. That is our biggest liability in this race, as a lot of the speakers have talked about, is that people just don’t know what’s going on,” Kemp said.
Echols, who has served on the commission since 2011, acknowledged that Democrats have an advantage due to the numerous municipal elections taking place and, along with other speakers, pivoted to campaigning on cultural issues. He called his opponent, Alicia Johnson, a “DEI specialist” who “wants to bring DEI principles into health care companies, and now she wants to do that at the Public Service Commission.”
District 2 Public Service Commissioner Tim Echols. Alander Rocha/Georgia Recorder
“She wants to bring DEI and wokeness to the PSC. We simply can’t let that happen, can we?” Echols said.
Alicia Johnson, the Democratic candidate for District 2, addressed the attack directly, calling the comments not just a “lie,” but a “racist, MAGA dog-whistle,” saying that her background is at the “intersection of community development, economic development and public policy.” She added that she believes the attack is a sign that the incumbents “are scared.”

“I think it really speaks to Tim Echols’ character and his personal values, and that it’s a reflection of him, not me,” Alicia Johnson said. “I’m not just a Black female, but I’m a wife, I’m a mother, I’m a grandmother, I’m a community leader. If he wants to point out that I’ve dedicated my career to helping people, communities and organizations grow stronger and healthier and more resilient, then way to go, Tim.”
Other speakers also resorted to culture war attacks, with Attorney General Chris Carr, who is running for governor, claiming that the “Democratic Party has been taken over by socialists.” Congressman Mike Collins, a U.S. Senate candidate, said that allowing the two Democrats to be elected would bring back “that green new scam of Joe Biden’s America” along with “California values of less power, more brownouts and higher energy.”
But despite Republicans’ concerns about reaching voters, Hubbard was the only candidate who participated in a recent debate hosted by the Atlanta Press Club. Hubbard, who debated against an empty podium as Fitz Johnson declined to participate, used the absence of his opponent to launch a direct attack on the incumbent’s record.
“My question would be, why didn’t you have the courage to show up today and defend your six rate hikes in two years?” Hubbard asked.
Echols and his opponent, Alicia Johnson, also did not participate in the debate.

The role of municipal elections
Charles Bullock, a political scientist at the University of Georgia, said in an interview that because Georgia still leans conservative, Republicans, who are also incumbents, have a slight advantage. However, he pointed to the general low visibility of PSC races, saying that voters typically don’t know who the candidates are or what the PSC does. Voters in this case are likely to show up to vote for local candidates they know and “tend to fall back on party ID,” Bullock said.
“That’s the kind of situation which therefore may create the opening where Democrats could break through and win one or both of these,” Bullock said.
Democrats are pledging to be a check on rising utility bills. The current commission has come under scrutiny for approving a series of rate increases requested by Georgia Power. 
Bullock and fellow UGA political science professor Trey Hood emphasized that the simultaneous municipal elections in cities, typically where Democrats live and contested races are common, can provide a stronger incentive for voters to show up at the polls.
“I think the argument about Democrats being somewhat advantaged because of these local elections is probably more correct, or probably has more weight,” Hood said, compared to the argument about voters being dissatisfied with rising energy bills.
Bullock said if Democrats were to win either or both seats, “this would be quite inspiring and exciting for them” as they head into next year’s elections, because they may see it as conditions trending in their favor. He said that even if both Republican incumbents win, Democrats could still interpret results as an advantage heading into 2026, where most statewide seats will not have a Republican incumbent running, potentially opening the door for more competitive contests.
Voter frustration over utility bills
Democrats and energy advocates are banking on voter frustration over rising utility bills helping to energize voters.
Charles Hua of PowerLines, an organization focusing on consumer energy issues, said in an interview that nationally, utility bills are the “fastest driver of inflation right now,” adding that utility bills in Georgia “have increased 33% in the last two years, translating to about $500 per year.”
Hua said that utility affordability is a “very animating issue right now” and could mobilize voters, but that the challenge is that the awareness of the PSC’s role is not high. Most state agencies across the U.S. that regulate utilities are appointed, unlike in Georgia, where voters can choose each of the five commissioners.
“We’re in the homestretch 27 days. What’s possible? Look, I don’t know. We don’t know. We’re going to see this play out … We don’t know what the final turnout number will be because this is the only statewide election you know on the ballot, and most people have not heard of it,” Hua said.
Connie Di Cicco, political director for Georgia Conservation Voters, an organization focused on environmental protection advocacy, said the frustration is “almost palpable at this point,” and that she believes that the direct connection between the PSC and bills is a strong mobilizing issue.
“Affordability is just a universal issue that a lot of people are feeling all over the state, and that is something that people are very upset about, and literally hits home. So if you’re feeling it and you don’t like it, then you can vote for change and make something happen in November,” Di Cicco said.",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DSC06614-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-13 05:57:00.125701

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)For years, Western leaders have debated the creation of a regional energy market: a coordinated grid to pool solar power in Arizona, wind in Wyoming, hydro in Washington and battery storage in California.
The shared resources would meet the demands of 11 different states, bolstering utilities’ local power plants with surplus energy from across the region.
With the passage of a landmark new law in California, that market is finally on its way to becoming a reality. Proponents say it has the potential to lower energy costs, make the grid more resilient and speed up the deployment of clean energy.
But the market’s success, experts agree, depends heavily on which states and utilities decide to opt in. As energy issues have become increasingly politicized, it’s uncertain whether Western leaders can buy into a common vision for meeting the region’s power needs.
“As we move toward weather-dependent renewables to run our grid, we’ve got to have a grid that is bigger than a weather pattern,” said California Assemblymember Cottie Petrie-Norris, a Democrat who sponsored the legislation aimed at establishing the new market. “A Western energy market is critical.”
The California measure earned bipartisan support, and leaders in conservative and liberal states alike have long touted the benefits of a region-wide market.
But some skeptics worry about merging the power systems of states with varying climate goals. And some fear the new market could give federal regulators appointed by President Donald Trump an opening to interfere and mandate more fossil fuel-powered plants that can be turned on regardless of the weather.
A bigger market
Across the 11 Western states that straddle or sit west of the Rocky Mountains, 37 separate private and public utilities operate portions of the grid.
States Reimagine Power Grids for Wind and Solar Future

This fragmented structure differs from the grid systems in Eastern and Midwestern states, where regional transmission organizations, or RTOs, coordinate and plan for energy needs across vast swaths of the country.
Backers of a Western market argue that a region-wide approach would be much more efficient.
Under the current system, each utility is required by state public utility commissions to build enough power to meet peak energy demands. That could mean building gas plants that only turn on a few times a year during extreme heat waves.
As part of a West-wide market, utilities could manage those high-demand events by importing power from other parts of the region that are generating surplus electricity. Such agreements could also prevent the periodic shutdowns of wind and solar farms when they produce more energy than local utilities can use.
“We could be drawing on the solar resources from the Southwest during the day, and then in the evening the wind resources in Montana and Wyoming are a great benefit,” said Austin Scharff, senior energy policy specialist with the Washington State Department of Commerce. “We have a lot of hydro resources, and we can help make sure the regional grid stays balanced when those are needed.”
Some industry leaders say such trading would allow states to pull in cheap electricity from elsewhere, rather than building expensive new power plants.
“When you have this bigger market, not everybody has to build to their peak in the same way,” said Leah Rubin Shen, managing director with Advanced Energy United, an industry group focused on energy and transportation. “Everybody’s able to share.”
Western states do trade electricity on a bilateral basis between individual utilities. Utilities spanning much of the West also transact through a real-time market that allows them to address pressing short-term demand issues. Some are poised to join a new day-ahead market that will conduct planning based on daily demand and production forecasts.










We’ve got to have a grid that is bigger than a weather pattern.


– California Democratic Assemblymember Cottie Petrie-Norris


But some lawmakers and officials believe the region needs a larger vision that goes beyond moment-by-moment needs, a market that can plan interstate transmission lines and energy projects to serve the whole region in the decades to come.
“We’re facing really rapidly growing energy demand,” said Nevada Assemblymember Howard Watts, a Democrat. “The best way for us to meet that is to effectively move energy all across the Western U.S. The only way we can do that is through an RTO.”
Watts sponsored a bill, enacted in 2021, that requires Nevada to join an RTO by 2030. Colorado also passed a law that year with a 2030 deadline for utilities to join an RTO.
“Any future is better than our status quo, which is 37 separate grids in the West,” said Chris Hansen, a former Democratic senator who sponsored the Colorado legislation. “We can lower costs and provide greater reliability if we’re sharing resources.”
Hansen now serves as CEO of La Plata Electric Association, an electric cooperative in southwestern Colorado.
A new market
The push for a West-wide market had always faced one major hurdle: Any market would likely include the massive geographical footprint and energy supply managed by the California Independent System Operator, or CAISO. As the West’s largest grid operator, CAISO manages the flow of electricity across most of the Golden State. It’s governed by a five-member board appointed by California’s governor, and other states were unlikely to sign up for a market in which they have no representation.
The law passed by California legislators last month allows for a new organization with independent governance from across the region to oversee Western energy markets.
“This legislation is a key reset and has been the largest sticking point in building a regional market,” said Amanda Ormond, managing director of the Western Grid Group, which advocates for a more efficient grid. “This is a primary concern of a lot of folks that has now been solved.”
Blue states hope their clean energy plans withstand collision with Trump

The law sets in motion a yearslong process that will task regional leaders with establishing the organization’s governance and navigating a series of regulatory procedures. The new market could be in place by 2028.
State leaders across the West say the California law is a long-awaited development.
“You get this really good benefit from being able to optimize across a larger footprint than an individual utility can,” said Tim Kowalchik, research director with the Utah Office of Energy Development. “Those resources can play really well together.”
Utah led a study in 2021, collaborating with other Western states, exploring the potential for energy markets in the region. State officials say the research has helped drive the current effort.
“It was fascinating how substantial the benefits were,” said Letha Tawney, chair of the Oregon Public Utility Commission. “The interdependence of the West started to become much more apparent, and it really changed the conversation.”
The study looked at a variety of market options and found that an RTO would have significant benefits, lowering costs for electricity customers and promoting clean energy. Based on the study’s projections, the market would produce roughly $2 billion in gross benefits per year, largely by saving utilities from building extra capacity.
Another study in 2022, conducted by a pair of consulting firms, found that an RTO would create as many as 657,000 permanent jobs and bolster the region’s economy.
While Western leaders say the potential benefits are massive, no states outside of Nevada and Colorado have committed to joining a regional RTO. State leaders say they’ll be watching carefully to see what emerges from the new California law. While the decision on joining the market will largely be left to individual utilities, state regulators can play a major role by directing them to conduct an economic analysis of such a move.
State sovereignty
The push for a regional market has also faced opposition from skeptics who fear it undermines states’ power to set their own energy and climate goals. Some point to Eastern governors’ frustration with PJM Interconnection, the RTO that manages the grid across a swath of the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic.
“It’s very dangerous,” said Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog, a California-based nonprofit advocacy group. “We’re giving up control of our sovereignty. Once a state’s in, it’s not the state that has the control.”
Some experts fear that states with significant coal or gas industries may be hesitant to join a market that could incentivize their utilities to import cheap solar power from elsewhere. On the flip side, some climate advocates in California are wary of plugging into a market that could support coal power from out of state.
“Some states are parochial-minded: ‘This is a California thing, and we don’t want anything to do with California,’” said Vijay Satyal, deputy director of markets and transmission with Western Resource Advocates, a nonprofit climate-focused group. “That one state’s government will not decide how a market will be operated, it’s a seismic shift in the industry.”
Trump’s bid to support coal could cost ratepayers billions, report finds

Backers of an RTO argue that it can incorporate states’ varying energy goals. They point to research showing that the market will support renewable power. But others fear merging fates with coal-heavy states could give federal regulators more leverage to intervene in favor of fossil-fuel power.
Even if Trump is out of office when the market comes online, the regulators he appoints to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will still be serving out their terms. Some believe FERC could set rules that require the new market to favor fossil fuel-powered resources.
“When you have a mixed market with a lot of coal plants, it creates opportunities for the Trump administration to rejigger the rules to favor coal,” said Matthew Freedman, renewables attorney with The Utility Reform Network, a California-based consumer advocacy group. “In another reality, this would have sounded like a hysterical concern, but it’s pretty obvious where [Trump’s appointees to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission] want to go.”
Freedman’s group pushed California lawmakers for protections that would have given states more flexibility to withdraw from the market, while also prohibiting “resource adequacy” mandates that could be used by the feds to prop up coal. While those elements were included in a Senate version of the bill, they were stripped from the Assembly bill that ultimately was passed.
Supporters of the bill say such concerns are overblown, and the new market is structured to avoid the pitfalls facing other RTOs.
“The simple economic fact is that right now clean energy resources are the cheapest in the world,” said Petrie-Norris, the law’s sponsor. “We’re going to see solar displacing dirty fuels rather than the reverse.”
Much depends on convincing states and utilities it’s in their best interests to join the market. The strength-in-numbers advantages of an RTO depend on widespread participation. While many Western leaders have long touted a region-wide market, the opportunity is arising at a time where energy has become a partisan issue.
Meanwhile, the long-awaited market emerging from California is facing new competition from the east. The Southwest Power Pool, an Arkansas-based RTO serving the middle of the country, is expanding its footprint in the West, with several utilities poised to join its day-ahead market.
“Anytime you have two neighboring utilities in different markets, you have seams that create a lot of friction and inefficiency,” said Rubin Shen, with the energy industry group. “Whether or not everybody can come together and be all-in on a full West-wide market, it’s too soon to tell.”

(Photo by K. Stoll/National Park Service)For more than 70 years, the American chestnut tree has, mostly, been absent from the landscape. But historical accounts of its grandeur and the tons of nutritious seeds it produced every fall have made it loom large in New England’s forest memory.
Now, as another tree disappears — the ash — scientists working in the White Mountains of New Hampshire hope they can document its demise to gain a new, deeper understanding of how species losses ripple through ecosystems.
When most American chestnuts were killed by chestnut blight in the first half of the 20th century, the loss of the species was felt both culturally and ecologically. The trees were among the largest in the forest, reaching heights of more than 100 feet. Scientists know the species took with it an autumnal chestnut crop that was nutritious for people and wildlife alike. They also suspect that the die-off disrupted tree-specific communities of insects and soil microbes. But regarding what those communities looked like, and to what extent their loss rippled through the forest ecosystem, they can only make educated guesses.
“More or less, the species has been deleted from the landscape,” said UNH professor Jeff Garnas, who studies forest ecosystems and health in the Northeast. “… That happened 100 years ago, and we really have very little ecological understanding of what the consequences of the loss of (American chestnut) are,” he said.
Now, Garnas and the other researchers working on the Ash Protection Experiment at Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, in the White Mountains, hope they will be able to shed light on the effects of tree loss events by studying another as it unfolds.
Ash trees, members of the Fraxinus genus, are vanishing from forests across the Northeast, Midwest, and parts of the South as they fall victim to the invasive emerald ash borer. When the beetle infests an ash, the tree typically dies within three to five years. The emerald ash borer has killed hundreds of millions of ash trees across North America since it arrived, likely during the 1990s, according to Southern Forest Health. 
The emerald ash borer was first detected in New Hampshire in 2013 and has since made it to every county in the state. The future looks grim for ash in North America, Garnas said. And at Hubbard Brook, where the ash borer was first detected in July 2021, scientists are beginning to see trees dying off as it takes hold.
“As unfortunate as it is, the emerald ash borer stands to delete another, in this case, genus of trees … from our forests,” he said. “And so we wanted to take the opportunity to ask questions about the fundamental feedback between the tree species and associated biodiversity and ecosystem function.”
That feedback includes many relationships among forest organisms, from the microbes and fungi in the soil to plants and insects living beneath the tree canopy — all of which are shaped by trees. The ash tree protection experiment will allow scientists to track the impacts of ash borer on those communities and relationships, Garnas said. And while the exact impacts of the American chestnut’s decline all those years ago will remain a mystery, Garnas hopes the findings of this experiment will, among other things, help scientists get a better idea of what they may have looked like.
The experimental setup includes dozens of forested research plots in Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, each with seven to 15 “large, mature ash” trees, Garnas said. Ash trees in half of the plots were injected with a powerful insecticide at the outset of the study — which began in a flurry right after the invasive beetles were found at Hubbard Brook in 2021, he added.
The insecticide, emamectin benzoate, is derived from a compound produced by soil microbes. An injection can protect a tree for three to four years, Garnas said. However, he said, though the treatment has worked to protect trees from the emerald ash borer in the context of this experiment, it’s not a solution for ash loss more broadly. 
“At a forest scale, you know, it’s really not going to be feasible to fight this invasion with chemical pesticides. … It’s more of a spot treatment,” he said.
By preserving the trees involved in the study, the Ash Protection Experiment may provide a system to study ash for years to come, even when others of their kind have long since died, Garnas said. Researchers elsewhere use the pesticide to preserve some ash trees as seed stock. The conservationists who undertake this work, Garnas said, hope the emerald ash borer will eventually be vanquished, or at least managed.
“With the hope that some of the other management tools will come to fruition and be, you know, as effective as they can be, people are sort of anticipating being able to at least keep some ash in the forest so that it’s there for when it can thrive again,” Garnas said. “You know, whether that’s 10 years or 100 years off – It’s hard to say at the moment.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/emeraldashborernps-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-13 05:57:00.125701

Now, serving as the executive director of the Wabanaki Alliance, the 41 year old said she is blown away by the breadth of people engaged with the issue. 
She shared these reflections with Maine Morning Star in light of the alliance’s third celebration of “Nihkaniyane: Let’s Go Forward Together” last week, when members and allies came together to recognize the coalition’s work and the relationships that make it possible. 
Noting the current political instability in the United States, Bryant said it is a precarious time for tribal rights, “but also, I see a lot of people turning to us and asking what they can do and I think that a lot of people want to work in their one little corner of the world.”
Since its founding in 2020, the Wabanaki Alliance has expanded, physically — with a coalition of more than 300 organizations across Maine and the addition of staff members — but also in the reach of its cause.

The Wabanaki Alliance was formed to advocate for changes to the 1980 Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act. That land agreement has resulted in the Wabanaki Nations — the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, Mi’kmaq Nation, Passamaquoddy Tribe and Penobscot Nation — being treated differently than other federally recognized tribes, with a relationship to the state more akin to municipalities than sovereign nations. 
Since the organization’s creation, progress has been made. For example, the state expanded tribal authority to prosecute crimes. But Gov. Janet Mills vetoed the latest proposed change this year, bipartisan legislation that would have prevented the state from being able to seize tribal land for public use. Mills has rejected sweeping reform and instead approached changing the relationship on a case-by-case basis. 
Though, already fairly widespread gubernatorial candidate support for tribal sovereignty suggests the state’s approach could change when Mills is termed out in 2026.

“I think it’s hard for tribal people sometimes to be widely accepted in the state,” Bryant said. “It’s such a weird line to walk sometimes, of being set in your stances of tribal sovereignty and having people accept you. There’s few people that do that very well.” 
One of those people, she said, is John Banks, a citizen of the Penobscot Nation who has dedicated his life to environmental stewardship. 
Banks, one of the Nihkaniyane honorees, was the longest serving member of the Maine-Indian State Tribal Commission, which is tasked with continually reviewing the effectiveness of the Settlement Act as well as the relationship between the Wabanaki Nations and state. He was also the first natural resources director for the Penobscot Nation, a role he served in for 41 years until his retirement in 2021.
Banks received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Natural Resources Council of Maine in 2021 and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 2019. 
One of his many contributions to the protection of natural resources was his role in the Penobscot River Restoration Project that was completed in 2016. The project, which removed two dams and created a bypass around a third to open nearly 2,000 miles of habitat, led to millions of river herring, Atlantic salmon and other species returning in numbers not seen for two centuries.
Laura Rose Day, executive director of the Penobscot River Restoration Trust, has credited Banks with saving the negotiations between environmental groups and the hydro company to allow the project to move forward. She said Banks reminded everyone of the concept of “all my relations,” the Indigenous idea that everything is interconnected, in explaining the shared responsibility for the river.
Banks and the two other honorees this year represent the passing on of generational wisdom in several respects.

Brianne Lolar, the Wabanaki Studies specialist for the Maine Department of Education, is a former teacher who has been working to help other educators include Wabanaki studies in their curricula. While it has been required teaching under state law since 2001, a 2022 report found it had not been meaningfully implemented across the state.
The author of that 2001 law, Donna Loring, suggested Lolar as an honoree, which Bryant said speaks volumes about how everyone is in this work together. 
“Instead of feeling any kind of complicated feelings about it not landing perfectly or being supported, she wants to really push forward Brie’s work,” Bryant said of Loring, who formerly served as Mills’ senior advisor on tribal affairs and on behalf of Penobscot Nation as a nonvoting member of the Maine Legislature, among other positions. 
The Legislature has attempted several times to pass a new law to allocate resources to ensure that this required curriculum is adequately taught, however such efforts have so far failed. The latest bill that sought to do this wasn’t funded last session and is being carried over to the coming year for further consideration. 
When talking about Passamoquoddy citizen Emma Soctomah, who is being honored for her academic achievements, Bryant highlighted the foundation for change laid by her father, Donald Soctomah.
As a state representative for the Passamaqoddy Tribe, he got a law passed to remove the sq-slur from place names in Maine. That was the first bill Bryant had ever testified on as a teenager, so she also personally credits Soctomah for sparking her desire to fight for legislative change. 
(Similar to the implementation of the Wabanaki studies law, there are continuing efforts to rectify noncompliance with Maine laws prohibiting racial slurs in the names of municipalities and other landmarks. But earlier this year a senator withdrew a bill that sought to do that because of the current political realities at the federal level.)

Soctomah’s mother, Elizabeth Neptune, is also a prominent name in public health work, having served for more than 13 years as director of health and human services for the Passamaquoddy Tribe at Indian Township.
So Emma Soctomah, too, exemplifies the kind of generational echoes seen between Loring and Lolar, Bryant said. 
“I’m familiar with the work of her parents,” Bryant said, “and then she gets to step in, educate, learn and be an example.”
This year, Soctomah was the valedictorian at the University of Maine at Machias. 
“My late grandmother always said the proudest moment of her life was when her children and grandchildren were to graduate,” Soctomah said in her valedictorian address. “I never truly understood why that was the case until fairly recently. Of course, she was happy to see us succeed but the pride went deeper than that. It comes from the obstacles that we, as Indigenous peoples, have to overcome.”
One in seven people in her Passamaquoddy community graduate with a bachelor’s degree, she said, compared to one in three people for the overall population.

Once the third-largest pharmacy chain in the United States, Rite Aid announced on its website that all of its stores are now closed. 
Health Care Dive reported the development on Oct.6. At the time of the closures, the chain was still operating more than 1,200 stores despite two bankruptcies, the news organization reported. 
“All Rite Aid stores have now closed,” the company’s website says. “We thank our loyal customers for their many years of support.”

Above the statement are buttons for now-former patrons to request their records and to find their new pharmacy if those records have been automatically transferred.
The closures are the latest blow to pharmacy access after years of complaints by independent and small-chain pharmacies. They have long claimed that middlemen owned by Fortune 15 health conglomerates have made their businesses unsustainable by sucking out all the profits.
Known as pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, the businesses decide which drugs are covered, negotiate non-transparent rebates with drugmakers, and decide how much to reimburse the pharmacies that had purchased and dispensed the drugs.
The three biggest PBMs control access to nearly 80% of patients. Their owners — UnitedHealth Group, CVS Health and Cigna-Express Scripts — also own top-ten insurers and pharmacies of their own. In other words, they decide how much to reimburse themselves as well as their competitors.
Critics say the system is rife with conflicts, and the Federal Trade Commission in January accused them of wild price hikes and possibly steering business to their own companies.
Big chains such as Rite Aid and Walgreens also are facing heavy competition from online retailers such as Amazon for business in front of the pharmacy counter. 
In June 2024, during its first bankruptcy, Rite Aid announced that it would close hundreds of stores in Ohio and Michigan. Ohio Board of Pharmacy spokesman Cameron McNamee said that as of Wednesday, Rite Aid had no active licenses in Ohio.

The company’s former stores join a host of others closing up in Ohio. 
When the board of pharmacy earlier this year unveiled a new tool to track closures, it revealed a sobering trend. Despite modest population growth, the number of pharmacies in the Buckeye State had dropped below 2,000 for the first time in memory. 
The creation of pharmacy deserts — places where none is close by — are particularly hard and the poor and the elderly, and others for whom transportation is limited.

This is the tenth year of the report, which the Ohio Domestic Violence Network compiles using statistics from media reports of intimate partner relationship fatalities. 
Ohio fatalities in the last 10 years: 

157 in 2025 
114 in 2024 
112 in 2023 
112 in 2022 
131 in 2021
109 in 2020 
91 in 2019 
115 in 2018 
101 in 2017 
81 in 2016 

Of this year’s fatalities, 95 were victims and 62 were perpetrators. There were 75 female fatalities and 82 male fatalities. 84% of all fatalities were a result of gun violence. 144 people were shot in 108 cases and only 12 people survived. 56% of the primary victims killed were people of color. 
Slightly more than half (55%) of perpetrators had a criminal history and 37% included felonies. 16% of perpetrators had a history of stalking and 12% of perpetrators had a history of strangulation. 
Eleven cases required SWAT responses and one Amber Alert was issued. One police officer was shot and survived. Another law enforcement officer was shot and killed responding to an intimate partner violence call. 
The youngest victim in the report was four months old and the oldest victim was 89 years old. Eleven children were killed — four were murdered by a parent and two were killed by their mothers’ boyfriend. 36 children saw a parent’s murder. 
Three teenage girls were murdered by teenage boyfriends and three pregnant women were killed by their babies’ fathers, according to the report. 
The relationship was ending or had ended in at least 35% of all cases. 40 cases involved a murder-suicide and four were attempted murder-suicide. 
All surviving perpetrators have been charged, according to the report. 
Intimate partner violence fatalities happened in 36 of Ohio’s 88 counties in 2025. Franklin County had the most with 33, followed by Cuyahoga County with 20.

Take the two of us, for example. We’re both lifelong Kansans who grew up in farming families, one in central Kansas, the other in northwestern Kansas, in the 1950s and 1960s.

(Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)Kansans often think of themselves as a rural people. Take the two of us, for example. We’re both lifelong Kansans who grew up in farming families, one in central Kansas, the other in northwestern Kansas, in the 1950s and 1960s.
Today, we both live in Lawrence.
Kansans are no longer a rural people. Almost half of the state’s population lives in just five of the state’s 105 counties: Johnson, Douglas, Shawnee, Wyandotte, and Sedgwick. Nearly one-fourth of the population lives in Johnson County alone. And the number of urban residents continues to grow.
That’s just one reason that the state’s public lands — our local, state, and federal parks and monuments — matter so much. Kansas ranks near the bottom in per capita public property.
Not only does Kansas have relatively small amount of park land, much of it is remote from the state’s population centers. The state’s largest parcel of publicly accessible property is the Cimarron National Grassland in Morton County in extreme southwestern Kansas. Many Kansans have never been there, maybe in part because the grassland is closer to the state capitals of Colorado, Oklahoma, and even New Mexico than it is to Topeka.
For an increasingly urban population, our state and federal parks are increasingly important. They are a way for people to know and enjoy the natural world. Plants and animals need these places too. With the threats of habitat fragmentation and climate change, these islands of the natural world are critical. Cranes and migratory shorebirds rely on Quivira National Wildlife Refuge and Cheyenne Bottoms in central Kansas. Because so many wetlands in this central flyway have been plowed up, those that remain are essential. These places also provide the public with places to watch birds, a growing pastime that generates its own economic benefit to local communities.
The love of these locations cuts across party lines. Poll after poll shows strong support for national parks. And people don’t just say it, they vote with their feet. National park visits hit 330 million in 2024.
That same support is evident on the local and state level.
For years, people asked us about the best places to see the Kansas chalk beds. But virtually all of these famous, scenic outcrops are on private property. In 2019, the Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks and the Kansas chapter of The Nature Conservancy opened Little Jerusalem, a 330-acre park in the chalk badlands of Logan County, south of Oakley.
Since its opening, Little Jerusalem has attracted thousands of visitors from across the country who hike the badlands, see prairie birds and plants, and ponder fossils on what was an ancient sea floor.
In short, our local, state, and federal parks are more popular and valuable than ever. They are also under threat. There are moves in Congress to sell federal lands. Staffing at the National Park Service has been cut. On the state level, park funding is regularly challenged, even though much of the Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks budget is funded by permits and fees.
That’s why public support for local, state, and federal public property is crucial. On the federal level, the Land and Water Conservation Fund (proceeds from offshore drilling royalties) provides millions of dollars to Kansas for public properties.
On the state level, a coalition of more than 40 conservation organizations, from the Farm Bureau to Audubon of Kansas, have formed Kansans for Conservation. They’ve proposed long-term, dedicated funding for conservation projects across the state.
Elected officials should understand the widespread support for efforts like the LWCF fund. The proposal from Kansans for Conservation deserves serious consideration.
The two of us have been lucky. We’ve watched ferruginous hawks soar over Little Jerusalem. We’ve seen blue pitcher sage bloom on the Tallgrass Prairie National Preserve. We’ve contemplated history at the Pawnee Indian Village Museum in Republic County and the military cemetery at Fort Scott.
If the public and elected officials stand up for them now, these places will be around for future generations of Kansans, no matter where they live.
Will Rogers once said, “Sanity is where you find it.” Many of us find it on public lands. We need these places. Now they need us.

(Stock photo from Getty Images.)With school in swing for the fall, enrollment numbers at Ohio’s colleges and universities are coming together. 
While all of Ohio’s public universities saw an increase in enrollment, each university also saw a decline in international student enrollment.
Enrollment at most Ohio public universities is up, but international enrollment is down

Wright State University had the most modest decline in enrollment, losing 4.3% of its international students. 
Bowling Green University and Cleveland State University, had the largest relative losses, each losing about a third of their international student enrollment.
Enrolling international students brings benefits to the state of Ohio. 
International students usually pay “sticker price,” meaning the entirety of their tuition tends to go toward supporting the state system and providing education for other students. 
International students also bring new perspectives to the classroom and student organizations, helping enhance the learning experience of students from Ohio and out-of-state students who may live in Ohio after college. 
International students who come to Ohio for school are also more likely to stay in Ohio afterwards, helping to counteract Ohio’s “brain drain” problem by bringing qualified people from abroad to bolster Ohio’s workforce.
While national-level headwinds are hard to overcome, Ohio has some tools in its belt to attract international students.

Ohio could create a statewide tuition and internship initiative. This could use funds to create modest reductions in tuition in priority fields: think engineering, data science, and health. 
This could be paired with an internship program where universities work with Ohio employers to hire international students and keep them on after graduation. 
This could help bring in international students targeted towards filling holes in Ohio’s workforce, which would lead to higher earnings and more job creation in the state in the long run.
The state could also market its universities as a single destination, rather than 14 universities under different brands. 
Ohio has amenities that should make the state an attractive destination for international students: affordable cities, safety, and job opportunities in lucrative fields such as healthcare, manufacturing, logistics, and technology. 
Making Ohio’s offering clear could lead to, for instance, Miami University losing more international students to places like Ohio University and less places like Michigan State.
The state could invest in reducing bureaucratic friction for international students. 
Standardized driver’s license or state ID rules could make it easier for international students to get identification that can connect them to other amenities in the state. 
Statewide welcome centers at airports could give new international students a place to begin as they arrive in the state. 
And providing legal and visa services across universities, the system could help support international students in dealing with an increasingly fickle federal Department of State.
Finally, the state can try to help students stay in Ohio after they graduate. 
An H1-B bridge program with universities as sponsoring partners could help students transition into the working world. 
Requiring JobsOhio to count international talent retention as a key performance metric could also encourage companies to retain international students in the state.
International students bring vibrancy, talent, and economic vitality to the state of Ohio. 
For Ohio to stay competitive in a global economy, it needs to have a global workforce. Steps like this could help it do just that.

The latest iteration of its malodorous effect is Nebraska Secretary of State Bob Evnen admitting that sending voter registration data to the U.S. Department of Justice is all right with him. Seriously? Evnen is okay — as is state Attorney General Mike Hilgers […],"Voters fill out ballots in the Nebraska Union at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln on Tuesday, Nov. 5, 2024. (Marissa Lindemann/Nebraska News Service)The Big Lie is the stinker that keeps polluting the political atmosphere.
The latest iteration of its malodorous effect is Nebraska Secretary of State Bob Evnen admitting that sending voter registration data to the U.S. Department of Justice is all right with him. Seriously? Evnen is okay — as is state Attorney General Mike Hilgers — with the DOJ having our birth dates, driver’s license numbers and the last four digits of our Social Security numbers? I’ve ordered widgets online without disclosing that much info. 
To be fair, the feds already have our SSNs, and some other personal details might be appropriate for ERIC, the Electronic Registration Information Center, which helps states share data to keep voter rolls accurate and up to date.
But the DOJ? Apparently it needs the data to continue the Sisyphean sham that the 2020 presidential election was suspect. The miasma from that fractured fairytale of a crisis in our election integrity has since befouled the public discourse. The crisis took a hiatus during the 2024 general election. 
Here are some ideas: Let it go. Clear the air. Move on.
Nevertheless, the Big Lie’s coattail is Evnen’s rationale for sending our details to Washington — which, as of this writing, is blocked by a lawsuit. He maintains, without evidence, that Nebraska’s electoral house is in order but that other states might be letting non-citizens vote in numbers enough to swing an election. Sending our state’s voters’ private registration information to the DOJ, because we believe a lie that has been nothing but a lie since its inception makes little sense. 
When you register to vote, your name and address become part of a public record, available to whomever would want them although a fee is charged for access. To his credit, Evnen said he wants to know how secure the data would be and how it would be used. Gee, you think? Especially given our recent descent into data hell with Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) coders.
The Big Lie remains just that, but its consequences have reshaped and to some extent hollowed out part of our democracy by eroding trust. In Nebraska, you can draw a straight line from the Big Lie to why we now present photo IDs to vote, despite no evidence that Nebraska ballot boxes were ever stuffed with unsavory Xs. 
While you have your pencil out, draw the same line to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the nation’s Capitol and the near-miss of having a free and fair election overturned. Nor was Nebraska alone in its wont to change its voting process without evidence a change was necessary. 
In 2021 alone, according to the Brennan Center for Justice,, 19 states enacted 34 restrictive laws that made casting a ballot harder than before. The Big Lie did more than call into question our elections without substantiation, it contributed to a growing distrust in the nation’s institutions. 
Your pencil should also connect to conspiracy theories, which add to this erosion of faith and are amplified by the exponential power of social media. We’re left with a sludge in which we can’t even agree on the facts, let alone something that approaches the truth. 
Unless you’ve been vacationing on a distant planet, you are also aware — or should be — that lying, from fibs to pants-on-fire fabrications, has become commonplace. If you’re an average American, you’re telling a whopper or at least a lie of some size about 11 times a week, according to research from the American Psychological Association. Some liars can’t seem to help themselves. According to the Journal of Social Psychology, more than half of us tell a lie three times within a 10-minute conversation. Yikes.
Those numbers seem high to me, but perhaps you know a compulsive liar  who skews the data. I’m not sure if it’s a compulsion, but I can think of a group — and where they work — who make stuff up as they go along. Maybe you can, too.
Perhaps of greater concern is our too often inability to ferret out a plain lie, challenge an incredulous assertion or believe a notion offered without relevant evidence. The same whitecoats disaggregating the numbers a couple paragraphs above might argue that we do that for a number of reasons, not the least of which is “confirmation bias,” believing what supports what we already believe.
All of which makes sense if you’re a scientist. But let’s not give the private data of Nebraska voters to the DOJ based on something that is simply not true.

Rescue and recovery efforts began Sunday in western Alaska as a major storm caused by remnants of Typhoon Halong hit coastal communities with massive storm surge, flooding and hurricane-force winds up to 100 mph. 
The storm bore down on the lower Kuskokwim River delta region early Sunday morning with the most significant damage reported in Kipnuk, Kwigillingok, and Napakiak. 
The U.S. Coast Guard and Alaska Air National Guard, and Alaska Army National Guard dispatched rescue aircraft to conduct search and rescue efforts, and begin delivering needed supplies. 
There were no serious injuries or deaths reported as of Sunday afternoon, according to the Alaska Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management. 
“Search and rescue is the priority at this time,” said division spokesperson Jeremy Zidek by email. He said rescue teams searched the multiple homes that were torn up and floating in nearby waters. 
On Sunday, the Alaska State Troopers reported at least 18 people were rescued in Kwigillingok and at least 16 people were rescued in Kipnuk.
Gov. Mike Dunleavy extended a disaster declaration first issued on Oct. 8 to coordinate disaster response and recovery resources for communities in the Yupitt, Pribilof Island and Lower Kuskokwim Regional Education Attendance Areas. 
“Every effort will be made to help those hit by this storm. Help is on the way,” Dunleavy said. 
Representatives of coastal villages reported on an afternoon call hosted by the nonprofit Association of Village Council Presidents that residents were sheltering in place, many in local schools, and were assessing the damage. 
The storm caused major erosion, damaging boardwalks, roads and bridges. It sank boats and damaged homes with high winds. Some homes were blown off foundations and turned over. Some communities reported power outages and a loss of cell service, and were relying on backup generators and Starlink satellites for wifi connection. 
Zidek said that there were no emergency evacuations, but the Alaska National Guard’s Bethel Readiness Center was equipped with a 100-bed shelter to receive evacuees if necessary.

(Photo by Getty Images)In New York, they brag about Broadway and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
In Chicago, it’s Millennium Park and Frank Lloyd Wright buildings.
Arizona has the Grand Canyon; Colorado has the Rockies; New Mexico has Area 51.
Very nice, I’m sure.
Still, none of them can hold a chlorine-scented candle to Florida, home of the Waste Pro Garbage Truck Museum; the Bike-Riding Parrots of Sarasota Jungle Gardens; Big Betsy, Islamorada’s 30-foot high spiny lobster; not to mention the Beach Tomb of Morris the Cat in Gulfport or any of our other awesome contributions to culture.
Nobody’s ever seen anything like them.
But our state will soon have an even more important attraction.
Lordly. Majestic. Certain to be clad in 24 karat gold.
I speak, naturally, of the Trump Presidential Library Hotel and Massage Parlor soon to be built in Miami.
Nobody’s ever seen anything like it.
Miami Dade College had some land sitting there on its Wolfson campus and, instead of doing something stupid with it like make a park or a cultural center or housing for students or whatever, MDC’s Board of Trustees voted to give the land — worth a paltry $200-300 million — to the state.
They voted in secret, with no public comment and no community input, but who could possibly object to such a stable genius project?
The state will, in turn, give it to the Trump Presidential Library Foundation, which means the place will be controlled by the Trump family.
“President Trump has a great story to tell as a Florida resident,” says state Attorney General and swashbuckling scofflaw James Uthmeier. “I think it’s quite fitting that we house it … as Miami becomes kind of the capital of the world in many respects.”
New York, Mumbai, Beijing, London, Paris — y’all just shut up.
Suggestions that Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Florida Cabinet members may aspire to higher office in the near future, and know they’d be wise to court Donald Trump’s favor, are unfair.
AG Uthmeier has just been endorsed by the president, but that’s because he’s the greatest. Nobody’s ever seen anybody like him.
Trump DNA
Second Son Eric Trump posted on social media (where woke rules of grammar, punctuation, syntax, and other boring so-called aspects of “English usage” totally do not apply): “Consistent with our families DNA, this will be one of the most beautiful buildings ever built, an icon on the Miami skyline.”
As we all know, Eric Trump is a brilliant and totally ethical businessman, and the Trumps have the most exquisite taste. Just look at what his father has done with the Oval Office.
Who knew you could get such gorgeous carved onlays from Home Depot!
It is true the parcel of land is a bit small, only 2.63 acres, especially compared to Lyndon Johnson’s 30 acres in Austin, Texas, or the Jimmy Carter Presidential Library’s 37 acres.
So what? Size does not matter and small can be beautiful: Look at the president’s hands!
You build tall, tall like the president himself, who is at least six-foot five. Maybe six.
How about 100 stories? That will beat the Panorama Tower, which everybody knows is not that beautiful.
The science nerds and climate change alarmists will tell you that since average elevation in Miami is two yards above sea level, and the site is pretty much on Biscayne Bay and about 300 feet from the Miami River, there’s a big danger of flooding.
Also, hurricanes.
No big deal. They can put the “library” part of the library lower down — that’s just books and paper and stuff — and the hotel and massage parlor — the important parts — on higher floors.
It’ll be a glittering palace on Biscayne, visible from space!
Just kidding about letting it flood. We’ll want to protect the priceless artifacts of America’s Golden Age.
Treasures such as the president’s collection of photo-shopped Time Magazine covers, the famous shoe with the piece of toilet paper stuck to the bottom of it, his hurricane-bending sharpies, his special copy of the Epstein “Birthday Book,” his diamond-studded ketchup bottle, and that world-famous 20-foot red necktie.
Sure, there are nay-sayers, carpers, whiners, complainers, boo-birds, and other losers making noise.
Miami Dade College President Emeritus Eduardo Padrón, a guy who obviously doesn’t understand the great honor being accorded MDC, says it’s “frankly unimaginable” this decision was made “without any real discussion of the consequences of what that will do to the college.”
A bunch of busybody pollsters have found that 74% of Miami-Dade residents want the college to keep the land.
Dr. Marvin Dunn, a professor of psychology at FIU, has filed a lawsuit on the ground that Miami Dade College state violated Florida’s Sunshine laws.
The suit claims the public notice posted by the MDC board did not say they would talk about giving away taxpayer-funded property, but just said they’d “discuss potential real estate transactions.”
Picky, picky, picky.
That Dunn guy is such a troublemaker, always going around telling people about Black history and whatnot, just to make them sad.
Now you’ve got a bunch of fuss bunnies banging on about how the Trump library/hotel/massage parlor site is next to Miami’s Freedom Tower, which some of those never-satisfied Cubans see as sacred or something.
‘Ellis Island of the South’
Yeah, it’s the “Ellis Island of the South,” the place Cubans who ran from the communists in 1959 went to get papers and medical care, learn English, and receive help settling in Miami, where they began taking over, speaking a foreign language, insisting white people eat Ropa Vieja and drink good coffee, and attacking the integrity of American tooth enamel with their lethal Tres Leches cakes.
Some of them actually protested on the future site of what Eric Trump so rightly calls “the greatest Presidential Library ever built, honoring the greatest President our Nation has ever known.”
Tessa Petit, who runs some wild lib outfit called the Florida Immigrant Coalition, says “it’s ridiculous they’re putting a library of someone who represents everything that is contrary to freedom, someone who’s making it his mission to destroy immigrant families, next to the Freedom Tower.”
One woman, whose family left Cuba in the early 1960s, said she’s against it because the president has “a track record of destroying civic engagement and only supporting those world views that are in alignment with his own.”
Another Cuban-born radical named Yousi Mazpule, a Miami Dade College professor, calls it “a slap in the face,” telling WLRN she objects to the library/tower/massage parlor “being put right next to the Freedom Tower where so many Cubans ran from a dictator.”
That’s gratitude for you — after all the president has done for Cubans!
A bunch of them are currently getting free room and board in federal detention centers.
The Trump administration has revoked so-called “temporary humanitarian parole” for about 300,000.
Our dedicated Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem explains that Cuba, like Nicaragua, Afghanistan, Haiti, and Venezuela, are now perfectly safe, really nice places that probably have great malls.
Yes, the Cubans used to be welcome as refugees from communism, but that was before Kristi Noem was born, so she’s never heard about it and it doesn’t matter.
Now they qualify for a free trip home to Havana and, if ICE won’t let them take their small children or spouses, and they have to fly back wearing shackles, well, that what they get for being, like, foreign.
In the meantime, the Trump Freedom Tower Biscayne Hotel, Library, and Massage Parlor will draw crowds of pilgrims from all over the world, from Idaho to Oklahoma, to stay in one of its luxurious MAGA suites and worship at his shrine, drawn in like bugs to a glue trap.
Florida should be proud.

The recent mass shooting in Minneapolis, where two children —Fletcher Merkel, 8, and Harper Moyski, 10 — were killed outside a Catholic school, is a tragic reminder of the urgent need for action. In response, Sen. Richard Blumenthal and Connecticut advocates called on lawmakers to strengthen gun laws and ensure schools are safe places for children.

Melissa Kane is the Democratic First Selectman candidate.
Some politicians responded by calling Sen. Blumenthal’s remarks “faux outrage” and a “sad attempt to politicize this tragedy.” That reaction is exactly the problem.
Gun violence has been treated as optional by too many leaders, who refuse to see it as the urgent public health crisis it is. Instead of working with us to prevent tragedies, they blame “rhetoric” and “the media” while sidestepping the clear evidence: States – like Connecticut – with stronger gun laws have fewer gun deaths. That is not “faux outrage.” That is fact.
Here in Connecticut, our laws—Ethan’s Law, bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, extreme risk protection orders—have saved lives. We are proof that smart gun policy works. But our borders are porous, and weak laws in other states undermine our progress. That is why national action is necessary.
No parent should have to send their child to school fearing they may not come home. And in a country where politically motivated shootings are on the rise — from attacks on faith communities to violence at political events — we cannot ignore the reality that gun violence and political violence are increasingly intertwined. No community should normalize daily shootings. And no elected official should score political points off the grief of families while blocking the very policies that could protect them.
Gun violence prevention isn’t about left versus right. It’s about life versus death. Inaction comes at a cost we can no longer afford.

Then Oct. 7, 2023, happened, when Hamas invaded Israel, resulting in the deaths of 1,200 people and the taking of 250 hostages. It must also be said that Israel had been committing war crimes against the Palestinians for decades. Having been to the West Bank and Israel, and having friends in both places, I was moved to raise my voice against the killing of civilians in Israel and then, for the past two years, against the ongoing genocide in Gaza and the accelerated ethnic cleansing of Palestinians in the West Bank. I helped organize a 25-mile Walk for Gaza, a New Haven Freedom Flotilla, speaking engagements, and fundraising to feed starving Palestinians.

And then Trump came back to power, legitimized by winning the popular vote and turbocharged by Project 2025 – which he claimed to have no knowledge of – to systematically destroy our democracy, focusing as he has from the beginning of his first run for president on immigrants, whom he has described as “criminals, rapists, vermin, scum.” Speaking Spanish, having traveled in several Latin American countries, and having worked alongside immigrants for many years, I began reporting on the immigrants’ rights movement in Connecticut and was drawn to providing support where I could.
There are only 24 hours in a day, and it could be said that I was spreading myself way too thin, being ineffective as I tried to cover too many bases. Yet, another way to look at it is that these three issues – climate, Palestine, and immigration – are closely linked, and it’s critical to lift up those connections.
The climate is changing faster in some parts of the world than others. Among the hardest hit countries are those in the Northern Triangle of Central America – Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador – where climate-supercharged hurricanes have devastated the region and ongoing drought has destroyed subsistence farming. When I was on the U.S./Mexico border in 2019, I met many immigrants who told me it was flee or starve. The U.S., as the largest historical emitter of greenhouse gases, has played a direct role in this scenario, and those three countries have made an outsized contribution to the flow of immigrants at the southern border.
As for Palestine, war has the most concentrated impact on the climate of all human activities. A recent study on greenhouse gas emissions from the war in Gaza shows that “The carbon footprint of the first 15 months of Israel’s war on Gaza will be greater than the annual planet-warming emissions of a hundred individual countries, exacerbating the global climate emergency on top of the huge civilian death toll.” And, of course, the war has gone on an additional nine months, with even more intense bombing as Israel aims to flatten every building in Gaza. It’s not only genocide, but ecocide, as wells are destroyed and all living things suffer and die and the ecosystem itself is being irreparably damaged under the millions of tons of crushed concrete and dust.
What about the connection between Palestine and immigration? Of course, people in Gaza can’t leave now, but Israeli leader and official war criminal Benjamin Netanyahu would like to push them, as well as Palestinians in the West Bank, off their land to some unknown destination. They are determined to stay, although they are paying an enormous price.
Their tragic dilemma just highlights the agony of migrants everywhere, most of whom want to stay in their own countries and only start moving through the push of necessity. Another connection is that Palestinian immigrants – like Columbia University activists Mahmoud Khalil and Mohsen Mahdawi – have been caught up in Trump’s illegal prosecution and attempted deportation of legal residents (green card holders), encouraging solidarity between immigrants and Palestine activists.
The ”poster girl,” as it were, for the unity of these issues is Greta Thunberg, who gained worldwide fame as a teenager demanding climate action from world leaders. She has now stepped into the role of human rights campaigner (although clearly climate action is also part of the fight for human rights). She was arrested by Israel and deported for her role in an earlier Freedom Flotilla, trying to bring material aid to Gaza by sea. She later became part of the Global Sumud (“steadfastness” in Arabic) Flotilla of 47 small boats with crew from 45 countries which again tried, unsuccessfully, to break Israel’s blockade of Gaza.
Time is short, and these three interconnected issues will determine what the future of humankind looks like.  Even though things often look hopeless – especially since Trump took office – I won’t give him the satisfaction of giving up. My goal is to make things a little less horrible and extend our window of survivability for as long as possible.

Junior Ta’Son Wallace scored five rushing touchdowns in the Spartans victory over the Panthers, Friday October 10.
 
WILMINGTON — St. Mark’s offense lined up at their own 37 yard line in the pistol formation with junior running back Ta’Son Wallace two yards behind quarterback Brett Greene. On the Spartans first offensive snap of the game, Greene turned to his right and handed the ball off to Wallace. A few seconds later he was entering the endzone. 
Wallace ran the ball down the right side of the field accumulating 63 yards and a touchdown on his first carry of the game. It was the first of five touchdowns for Wallace Friday night, leading the Spartans to a 47-7 victory over Polytech.
Wallace finished the game with over 170 total yards and was the catalyst for the Spartans highest scoring total of the season. Wallace scored three of his five touchdowns in the first quarter adding a 19-yard score and 3-yard touchdown in the game’s first frame. 
Polytech responded with a touchdown on a pass from sophomore quarterback Haleem Edwards to junior receiver Zaine Harris. Harris made a leaping grab in the middle of the field and ran between the hashes to the endzone completing the 73-yard play with a score that cut into the Spartans’ lead as the first quarter came to a close.
The Spartans leaned on their junior rusher for two more touchdowns to end the half and finished their scoring with a touchdown pass from Greene to junior Jack Donahue in the third quarter. St. Mark’s defense didn’t allow a score in the final three quarters, holding Polytech’s dynamic offense to its lowest point total this year. 
The win brings St. Mark’s district record to 1-1 and their overall record to 3-4 in its first season under head coach Bill DiNardo. Polytech’s record stands at 4-2 this season after beginning the year with four straight wins. 
The Panthers will face DMA at home on October 17 for their second district matchup of the season. St. Mark’s will go on the road in its next matchup for a battle against the Milford Buccaneers on October 24.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_4216-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-12 23:56:15.872056

“We haven’t had any showers since Thursday or even been able to wash our hands,” said Josh McKnight, an inmate, in a phone call late Sunday afternoon with the Daily Montanan.
The state’s Department of Corrections responded to a “water pipe break” at the Deer Lodge facility on Friday, an Oct. 10 press release from the agency said.
“The break occurred in the pipe carrying water from the well house to the main water tank, which supplies water to the secure compound,” the state press release said. “Sletten Construction is assisting the department in repair efforts by providing additional excavation equipment. This water outage affected the secure compound at MSP; the dairy and Work and Reentry Center were not impacted.”
On Sunday, Montana State Prison’s population was 1,610, according to a Department of Corrections database. Its capacity is 1,551.
A Saturday update by the agency said the source of the leak had not been found and that they were continuing to “work and monitor” the broken pipe.
The same release said several agencies had come in assistance, including the Montana National Guard, which delivered 15,000 gallons of water from Deer Lodge. The state also reported 30,000 water bottles were delivered on Friday.
Probation and parole officers from Missoula and Helena are also assisting with security at the facility, the news release said.
A spokesperson for the state Department of Corrections said Sunday afternoon the DOC was working on responses to questions sent Sunday from the Daily Montanan including ones about staffing levels at the prison, the status of bathrooms at the facility, and other issues. 
“The Department is working as quickly as possible to find the break and restore all services to Montana State Prison,” DOC Director Brian Gootkin said in a Saturday news release. “We’re thankful for the long hours staff have already put in and to our partners who have stepped up to help out.”
Additionally, the state said 50 portable toilets were delivered to MSP on Friday and that they were “in the process” of ordering showers. The state release also said meals, inmate services and recreation had not been impacted.
However, McKnight told the Daily Montanan inmates have not been able to shower since Thursday, and they have been given just six bottles of water a day for all of their needs, including to drink and to clean themselves.
McKnight also said some people who are incarcerated and have medical issues need more fluids than they have access to.
He said people who use wheelchairs have difficulties using the portable toilets, and one inmate has been declining food as a result.
McKnight said the man had open sores that were healing but ripped open after trying to use a portable toilet that didn’t accommodate a chair he needs to use over the toilet seat.
He said the prison already is a breeding ground for conditions such as hepatitis, and overflowing toilets inside have exacerbated the problem.
“It’s super unsanitary,” McKnight said. “For staff and inmates alike, it is a dangerous situation.”
Amanda McKnight, who runs a Facebook page called Incarcerated families in Montana Prisons, said her visit was canceled on Saturday, but she learned about it first from her husband, not the Department of Corrections.
Josh McKnight said an agency official told the inmates that families didn’t need to see the “filth” at the facility, and visitation had been canceled out of “respect for families.”
He said corrections officers are doing their best to try to make sure people stay level-headed, but the situation is difficult for them too.
“I don’t think they want to be here either,” McKnight said. He said one officer told him, “They’re not going to want the public to see this.”
Amanda McKnight said her husband told her the handwashing stations have run out of water, and the portable toilets have been vandalized or are overflowing because there are not enough toilets to meet the use.
She also said people who are incarcerated have not been able to go to the gym, and sewage at one point had backed up in the basement of the kitchen.
The Daily Montanan could not verify the status of the basement of the kitchen late Sunday.
In a follow-up call later Sunday, Amanda McKnight said her husband told her the prison had offered five-minute showers, but she said her husband reported water was trickling down the wall, and there was not enough pressure for a shower. 
Her husband told her inmates were told bacteria was not found in the water and it was available for limited use but not consumption, Amanda McKnight said.
Josh McKnight said people in the prison are on edge because they have not been able to take showers and get clean, the prison stinks, and drinking water has been limited.
“It’s a bad situation for a lot of people here right now,” McKnight said.
Kenzie Lincoln, whose husband, Bryce Baltezar, is currently at the facility, said inmates are not currently allowed to do laundry nor are they allowed any outside time. Lincoln has spoken with her husband via phone for a few minutes at a time over the last few days, she said. She’s also a member of support groups for those with family members incarcerated at the facility.
Lincoln, as well as other family members of those incarcerated, have painted a desperate picture for inmates over the past several days. Lincoln told the Daily Montanan that prisoners had been warned Wednesday evening that water may become an issue and to fill up containers. Inmates were later told not to drink that water, she said.
Thursday brought sanitation issues, she said. Inmates were warned that flushing the toilets could make the water run out faster, Lincoln said.
“The toilets were getting clogged, they weren’t flushing, and they were actually forcing inmates, basically to pee and poop in water bottles and plastic bags,” Lincoln said. 
Phone service has been cut to 10 minutes, she added, and said an in-person visit with her husband was abruptly canceled as she was on the way to the prison on Friday. Inmates are also allowed one bottle of water per meal, Lincoln said.
Bathrooms were cleaned and locked on Sunday morning, she added.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Montana-National-Guard-at-MSP--1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-12 19:57:10.826640

“We need to tell ICE our message that their surveillance will not slow us down. It will not stop us. It will only bring us out stronger,” one organizer said.

WILLISTON — More than 100 people gathered outside a national U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement intelligence hub in Williston Sunday afternoon to protest ICE’s plans to build out its surveillance capabilities at a nearby office in the same town.
The protest was organized by the Party for Socialism and Liberation, a national, anti-capitalist political movement with a chapter in Vermont. Speakers decried ICE’s plans, laid out in federal contracting records, made public earlier this month, to hire at least a dozen contracted workers at the agency’s National Criminal Analysis and Targeting Center. It uses intelligence-gathering networks to generate leads for immigration enforcement agents operating across the eastern U.S. 
Demonstrators gathered in the middle of Harvest Lane, the road that runs in front of ICE’s Law Enforcement Support Center — a facility that houses a national ICE tip line — with local police routing traffic around them.

Across the street from that center is another building run by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security which, on Saturday morning, was vandalized with threatening graffiti that appeared aimed at federal workers. The vandalized building was cordoned off by police tape on Sunday afternoon while the protest was taking place. 
Cora Honigford, one of the protest’s organizers, said the group was not responsible for the graffiti and had no information about who had done it. Local and federal law enforcement were beginning to investigate the vandalism on Sunday.
The National Criminal Analysis and Targeting Center, which is where the plans that sparked Sunday’s protest would be based, is located about 1.5 miles away from where the demonstration took place and the site of the vandalized building. 
Contractors at the targeting center would use social media platforms and online databases to help federal agents locate people who could be facing deportation, as well as friends and coworkers of those people, according to federal records. The plans are preliminary but say work could start as early as May 2026.

“We need to tell ICE our message that their surveillance will not slow us down. It will not stop us. It will only bring us out stronger,” said Honigford, who’s from South Royalton, in remarks to the crowd, drawing loud cheers.
Protestors held signs bearing slogans such as “No ICE Surveillance” and “ICE Fuera,” using the Spanish word for “out.” They chanted, among other refrains, “No justice, no peace! No ICE or police!”
Several speakers described ICE’s plans for social media surveillance in Williston as an escalation in the agency’s operations on top of the sharp increase in immigration enforcement that has defined President Donald Trump’s second term. The proposed surveillance is likely to target people already impacted by that enforcement the most, said Kate Paarlberg-Kvam, of the Vermont Asylum Assistance Project, a legal advocacy network for immigrants.
“Make no mistake, that the primary targets for this enforcement would be our Black and brown neighbors, who are advocates for their own dignity,” Paarlberg-Kvam told her fellow demonstrators. 
Michelle and Scott Stinson traveled up to Williston for the demonstration from Ludlow. Michelle held an upside-down American flag, which she said was a protest against ICE’s actions and future plans in the state.
“This is wrong,” she said of the proposed surveillance. “They should not be using us as a hub — for anything.”

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)CEDAR FALLS – Over the span of two decades, the Cedar Valley community has embraced urban conservation efforts on their properties and in their public spaces in an effort to improve water quality in Dry Run Creek.
Rain gardens, rain barrels and permeable pavement are some of the more than 300 water conservation practices that residents of Cedar Falls, and nearby Waterloo, have adopted over 20 years of the Dry Run Creek Watershed Improvement Project.
The watershed project is part of a water quality improvement plan with the Iowa Department of Natural Resources, and in collaboration with the Black Hawk County Soil and Water Conservation District. But, over the past two decades, the project has forged partnership with the cities, residents and local organizations in the name of improving Dry Run Creek’s water quality.
Josh Balk, the source water protection coordinator with the project for the past 11 years, said the watershed project has shown the power of community, as everyone steps up to play a role in protecting the watershed. 
“We all have common goals: everyone wants to live happy, healthy lives, be outdoors, enjoy themselves,” Balk said. “Getting involved with conservation, whether smaller or large scale, there’s indeed opportunities there.” 
According to the Black Hawk Soil and Water Conservation District, the water quality improvements in the region resulted in 120 million gallons of stormwater runoff filtered naturally into the ground each year and 3,700 tons of soil, annually, prevented from eroding into the creek.

At Clay Street Park in Cedar Falls, where a rain barrel workshop and celebration of 20 years of the project took place last week, participants could see examples of the watershed work in action. Between the basketball court and the playground at the park, a bioretention cell buzzed with insects and fall-blooming native plants. The bioretention cell, which is another name for a rain garden, not only provides habitat, but also helps absorb rain water that would otherwise run into city stormwater intakes and into the creek. 
A permeable alley also sat to the east of the park and ran up and down the block. The permeable pavers in the center of the alley filter and allow water and snow to seep into the ground below the concrete, rather than send that water to storm water infrastructure. 
Maria Perez, a storm water specialist with the City of Cedar Falls, said these projects were pushed by Balk and the watershed project, but represent the collaborative effort between the city and the project. 
“It’s always a collaboration,” Perez said. “There’s a lot of projects in the city because of this project.”

Balk said there are about 50 bioretention cells in the city, most of them in high traffic areas where residents are able to see and interact with the native plant landscapes. 
These projects make use of funds from the U.S. Environmental Protection Program, which are distributed to improve the water quality in Dry Run Creek. It also uses grants from state and local partners. Over 20 years, that funding equated to $3.1 million dollars in cost share funds spent on landowners who implemented the practices.
In the past couple of years, Balk said, the adoption of rain gardens in town has “skyrocketed” and when the project hosts a rain barrel workshop, as it did at the 20th anniversary event, he said they almost always sell out. 
“Thankfully, the Cedar Valley has been very interested, passionate about conservation, and we’ve been able to build upon that, provide the technical resources and the incentives so folks can make this conservation happen,” Balk said. 
Dan Pickar, of Cedar Falls, with about half a dozen participants, assembles a rain barrel at the event. Pickar said he has wanted to add a rain barrel to his backyard so he can water the plants without having to run the hose from the side of the house where his spigot is.

Community  impacts
While the City of Waterloo is not technically in the Dry Run Creek watershed area, Waterloo residents and city staff have been involved in the project as well. 
Kristine Beenken, of Waterloo, said she attended a practical backyards tour hosted by the watershed improvement project last year, which she said opened her eyes to the number of water management projects that had been installed, just in peoples’ backyards, throughout the Cedar Valley. 
Beenken said she already has a rain barrel on her property but spoke with Balk about adding a rain garden soon as well. The native plants in a rain garden, she said, not only help to protect the water in her area, but also make lawn maintenance a lot easier. 
Landowners, or homeowners, like Beenken who want to implement these practices get a consultation with Balk, who figures out what projects would work best, and helps to coordinate technical and financial resources. Usually, the project is able to find funding for up to 75% of the cost of the project, according to its website. 
Adam Himschoot, also of Waterloo, said he is interested in the water management project because flooding has become common in the region. 
“If everybody does a little bit … it might help out,” Himschoot said. 
After stepping out of a fish costume at the event, Cameron Agan, a storm water specialist with the City of Waterloo, said the city has millions of dollars worth of projects on their lists to improve storm water management. 
“So any little bit that homeowners can do, or business owners, helps with that,” Agan said.

Agan said storm sewer lines and plans are designed with five-year storms in mind, but he said the frequency and amount of rain in those storms has changed “quite a bit” since a lot of city infrastructure was built. 
Agan’s colleague, Ryan Shatek, also a storm water specialist with the city, said things like rain barrels, bioretention cells and permeable areas of pavement all help to reduce the amount of water headed for a storm sewer. 
“It’s not a lot, but it does help with a big flush of rain,” Shatek said. “Everything helps.”
Environmental impacts 
Balk said the Dry Run Creek Watershed Improvement Project was initiated because of two water impairments in Dry Run Creek, one for bacteria and another for stream biology. These impairments were largely attributed to stormwater runoff in the creek.
Balk said the project “hasn’t quite” reached its goals for water quality improvement, but is showing “improving trends.” He said biological diversity in the creek has had a “significant increase” since the project started.
Dry Run Creek has been subject to multiple fish kills, attributed to releases of manure from a dairy. These instances occurred near Decorah, about 80 miles northeast of Cedar Falls, and outside of the Dry Run Creek watershed area.
Balk said the Dry Run Creek watershed experiences an almost 2% increase in urbanization each year, which is part of why the urban water management strategies are a focus of the project. 
“We’re losing agricultural land and getting more hard surfaces,” Balk said. “Our land’s changing, and so (we’re) trying to find ways to get conservation in to protect the land we have.”

Tom Schilke has been a part of the Prairie Rapids Audubon Society since 1999 and said he has noticed a change in the wildlife now that there are more native plants in people’s yards and on city property. 
Schilke said he is starting to find more birds in town than in some of the natural spaces he frequents for bird watching. 
The native plants in people’s yards or on city grounds — like the bioretention cell in the middle of the park — mean there’s more habitat, food and better water quality in the area, which draws in more birds. 
“People think we’re just about birds … but it’s about ecology and how it all fits together,” Schilke said. 
Schilke said the society tries to get people to understand their surroundings more and why a bird might, or might not, be hanging around. Building a rain garden in a yard, or planting some native plants, he said, is a “good start.” 
“One little piece at a time builds momentum,” Schilke said. 
Beyond Cedar Falls and the direct watershed, Mary Beth Stevenson, chair of the Middle Cedar Watershed Management Authority, said the water quality improvements made by the Dry Run Creek Project are “incredibly important” to the health of the larger watershed. The Middle Cedar Watershed includes parts of Benton, Black Hawk, Buchanan, Butler, Franklin, Grundy, Hardin, Linn, Marshall and Tama counties. 
“The Dry Run Creek effort is an important model for community-based watershed improvements,” Stevenson said in a statement. “We are grateful to Josh Balk and the Black Hawk SWCD for all their work on improving water quality and educating citizens about what we can all do to improve water quality.”
Balk said the Dry Run Creek watershed effort has been unique in the fact that a large portion of the watershed is urban, where other watershed projects in the state might be focused more on rural, or agricultural land. 
“Everyone lives in the watershed, everyone has a role to play,” Balk said. “No matter what size land you own, what the land use is, there’s a way to get involved with conservation.”

Kylie Jorgensen)Late in August, Gov. Larry Rhoden called out the South Dakota National Guard to serve  for 30 days as crime-stoppers in Washington, D.C. It’s hard not to wonder why he did that.
By calling up the 129th Mobile Public Affairs Detachment, maybe Rhoden is showing his belief that the pen is mightier than the sword.
Maybe he reasoned that the 12-member unit from Rapid City could make the mean streets of D.C. safer — one news release at a time.
With a Republican primary for governor coming up next June, perhaps Rhoden saw the Guard deployment as a way to curry favor with President Donald Trump and get his endorsement.
If any of those is the reason, it’s not good enough.
12 South Dakota National Guard members joining D.C. force at Trump’s request

Rhoden called out the Guard unit at the request of the president. Since there really was no “crime emergency” in Washington, D.C., Rhoden would have been better off giving the president a polite but firm “no.”
The images of armed soldiers on the streets of the nation’s capital are reminiscent of the images from third world dictatorships. The presence of the Guard in D.C. may have curbed some crime, but the president’s reasons for that deployment, and others he has threatened, are less than compelling.
According to Trump, troops are needed to patrol the streets of crime-ridden cities ruled by Democratic mayors. Cities with similar or worse crime statistics that are governed by Republican mayors are exempt from an invasion of troops. Politics shouldn’t play a part in public safety, but it’s the first rule of the president’s plan to make big city streets safer.
Rhoden’s decision to so easily buy into the president’s vanity project is troubling. Perhaps he learned from his predecessor that the best way to curry favor with the president and polish up some conservative credentials is to call out the troops.
Gov. Kristi Noem had a bad habit of sending the Guard to the southern border and a willingness to let South Dakota taxpayers foot the bill. In announcing the D.C. deployment, Rhoden was sure to mention that the cost would be covered by the federal government. So taxpayers are still on the hook for the cost, but out of a different account.
A sampling of the D.C. work of the 129th shows they dutifully recorded the patrolling of the Guard as part of the effort to stop crime. They also recorded troops cleaning up parks and tidying national memorials — a good sign of the Guard’s work ethic and a bad sign that perhaps there’s not enough crime-stopping to go around for all the troops on the ground.

One of the South Dakota unit’s videos features U.S. Army Col. Larry Doane, commander of Joint Task Force D.C. After thanking the Guard troops for coming to D.C., he gives a short lecture on self-care, admonishing them to take time for themselves by hitting the gym, going for a run or watching a movie. Doane must not have read his marching order as those are just the kind of activities that Trump says the good citizens of Washington, D.C., can’t do safely because the city is so crime-ridden.
While the troops take time for themselves, it’s easy to wonder how their families are doing with self-care. Going for a run or watching a movie probably sounds pretty good to them. Trump’s vanity project leaves the husbands and wives of Guard members with a month of single parenthood. Employers may need a little relaxation as well, since they’re short-handed for a month.
At the end of their deployment, the 129th will have worked hard to chronicle the Guard’s activities in D.C.—a lasting record of how not to fight urban crime. It will also be a testament to one president’s ego and one governor’s hope that his eagerness to help during this “emergency” will not be forgotten.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/9356868-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-12 14:57:43.906374

WILLISTON — A U.S. Department of Homeland Security building in Williston has been  vandalized with threatening graffiti about a week after news broke about the department’s plans to bolster surveillance on social media sites at a different facility in the same town. 
The building that was vandalized is on Harvest Lane, across the street from a national U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement intelligence hub. At another site in Williston, off Industrial Avenue, public records released earlier this month show ICE plans to hire a dozen contracted workers to do surveillance work.
It was not immediately clear when the Harvest Lane building was vandalized. On Sunday morning, black graffiti was visible around at least three sides. The graffiti included phrases such as “kill yourselves,” “shoot yourselves” and “hang yourself,” as well as “not safe” and “die.”The word “scum” appeared to be written in large letters across the entrance.
A Boston Globe story earlier this month described the building as being used by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.
The building was flanked by police tape early Sunday afternoon. Several federal law enforcement officers were parked outside the ICE facility across the street. A protest against the surveillance plans was planned for outside the ICE facility that afternoon.
The vandalism comes as President Donald Trump’s administration has ratcheted up homeland security operations nationwide, prompting protests and, in some cases, clashes between protestors and federal law enforcement.
Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for more information Sunday afternoon.
This story will be updated.

A bystander reported the truck sped past a stop sign and collided with a tree in a nearby field, according to police reports. 
At the scene were two intoxicated men in wet and muddy clothes, denying they’d been in the truck and refusing to give their names, records show. Though the driver gave in and was detained for driving under the influence, the passenger remained defiant.
“F— you,” he repeated again and again. Officers handcuffed the man, who threatened to sue, yelling that he’d been a cop for 20 years. 
Finally, he gave up his name: Joshua Grasseth. Police booked him into jail for obstruction and unlawful possession of a dangerous weapon, since they found a switchblade knife in his pocket. He was found guilty for lying to police.
Nearly four hours away in a right-leaning rural county at the state’s southern border, Grasseth is now running for sheriff as a Republican in Wahkiakum County: population 4,400, the third smallest in the state. He’s spent the last two decades bouncing around small police agencies in Washington, but is no longer a working police officer. Two of those agencies would not share his personnel files, but InvestigateWest found that Grasseth has been convicted of at least two crimes while off duty and has a history of alleged domestic violence and dishonesty. The Wahkiakum County prosecutor says that, if elected, Grasseth’s troubled past would land him on the so-called Brady list — a list of officers flagged for credibility issues — that could undermine his credibility in court.
Grasseth’s opponent, current Sheriff John Mason, drew 85% of votes in August’s primary election. But police accountability advocates say Grasseth’s candidacy underscores a larger issue in Washington: Sheriff candidates are not backgrounded, and the state’s only requirement is that they complete basic law enforcement training within 12 months of taking office — a lax standard compared to what’s required to become a police chief or a lower-ranking officer or deputy. Had a bill increasing eligibility requirements passed the Washington state Legislature last session, his conviction for lying to police in 2022, a gross misdemeanor, would have disqualified him from running. Grasseth has no felonies on his record.

“Washington is exceptional relative to other states in having next to no eligibility requirements for sheriffs, even lacking the most common state requirements like a minimum age rule, or the requirement that the sheriff have a clean criminal record — or at least, no felony convictions — and undergo a criminal background check,” said Josh Parker, deputy director of policy at the Policing Project, an organization out of New York University’s School of Law that works to modernize law enforcement policies across the country. “Many states, including California, Georgia, Kansas and Oregon, also require sheriffs to be certified by a state licensing agency and stripped of that license if they engage in egregious misconduct.”
Grasseth, 47, who has campaigned on being “accountable, transparent, and deeply engaged” with his community, did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this article. On his Facebook campaign page, he addressed his false statement charge by stating, “I chose not to provide information about an incident in which I was a passenger in a vehicle. I accepted full responsibility in court, where I was honest about my actions and intentions. I received no jail time as a result of my cooperation and accountability.”
But Grasseth’s opponents believe if he became sheriff, it would diminish public trust for the agency.
“We took many years to foster a level of trust and transparency and partnership with the people in the community, and it takes a long time to build that trust,” said Mark Howie who was the county’s sheriff from 2012 to 2024. “You’re jeopardizing that trust with people the second that person comes in with that type of stigma attached.”
Upon Howie’s retirement, he recommended John Mason’s appointment to county commissioners. They appointed Mason by a unanimous vote.
Grasseth’s past
On Halloween night in 2009, Grasseth, then-working as a deputy for the Wahkiakum County Sheriff’s Office, called off work halfway through his shift, telling management he was sick and going home, but would remain on call. 
Instead, Grasseth met his then-wife at the Monticello Hotel bar in Longview. The couple reportedly got into an argument that turned physical. Grasseth hit his wife three times, according to a witness in the police report. He was then kicked out of the bar and went back to the hotel room alone. 
Hours later, Grasseth found his wife in the hotel parking lot in a vehicle with another man. He fought the man whom he had already suspected his ex-wife to be seeing, giving him a black eye and knocking out a tooth, court records show. She called the cops. Responding officers said Grasseth was “highly intoxicated” and arrested him for fourth-degree assault against his wife. The charge was reduced to disorderly conduct, a misdemeanor, and he was found guilty, according to court records. 
The event was relayed to Grasseth’s boss, former Sheriff Dan Bardsley, who “strongly considered” terminating the deputy. Bardsley had already warned Grasseth to “avoid contact with” the man he fought, according to a disciplinary letter.
Later that month, Grasseth resigned. The next year, he ran for county sheriff, unsuccessfully. 
He became an officer at the Lower Elwha Klallam Police Department near Port Angeles in the Olympic Peninsula in 2013. Then in 2018, he moved an hour and a half away to be a commander at the Port Gamble S’Klallam Police Department, north of Bainbridge Island. Neither department would share any information about Grasseth beyond confirming Grasseth worked there at one point.
In 2016, his ex-wife called the cops in nearby Clallam County, who arrested Grasseth for fourth-degree domestic violence, records show. That charge was dropped. His ex-wife declined to comment for this article.
On Grasseth’s campaign page, he addressed the domestic violence allegations raised by his ex-wife.
“These were only allegations, I have NO CONVICTIONS for such allegations because that is all that they were. I filed for divorce in 2016 and have had zero allegations or accusations since then.”
In the midst of the divorce and while working as an officer for the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe, Grasseth allegedly got into a relationship with Savannah Roberts, 21 years old at the time. He was never charged with crimes involving Roberts. However, her sister, Samantha Hoines, said he abused her physically and emotionally and isolated her from her family for years.
Roberts, who once loved playing softball and being with her family and friends, had “become a shell of herself,” Hoines said. “He tore her down. It was so hard to hear my sister think that no one liked her and that she was scared to make friends.”
Roberts remained out of contact with her family for years, afraid to speak out on the abuse because Grasseth was a police officer and she feared retaliation or not being believed, Hoines said. 
During their relationship, Roberts’ battle with alcoholism spiraled. After the two broke up a few years ago and the recent death of her grandmother, it intensified. Roberts died in April this year due to kidney and liver failure, Hoines said. She was 30.

Grasseth didn’t respond to multiple emails and phone calls from InvestigateWest. But a number that traced back to his wife, Amanda Grasseth, who is the Wahkiakum County election coordinator, texted an InvestigateWest reporter asking why the news organization was not looking for “anything positive about him.” She declined an interview request. Grasseth went to Facebook to announce a story was about to be published “including my past and false allegations,” characterizing the reporting as a “coordinated smear campaign” against him.
Sheriff qualifications
In Washington, sheriff candidacy requirements haven’t been updated since 1979 and only require a training certification post-election. Meanwhile, a 2021 law strengthened the backgrounding of peace officers to include a check into whether they are on any Brady lists maintained by county prosecutors.
“An 18-year-old without any law enforcement experience can run for sheriff, and I think that would surprise some people,” said Leslie Cushman, advisory committee member for the Washington Coalition for Police Accountability, an advocacy group made up of families impacted by police violence, experts and other policy-focused organizations. 
Grasseth hasn’t worked in law enforcement since 2021, and his training certificates have expired, according to Washington’s Criminal Justice Training Commission. If Grasseth assumed office, he would have up to a year to complete required training.
House Bill 1399, the bill that failed to pass the Legislature last year, would have changed eligibility requirements for sheriff candidates to include having: a high school diploma, no felony or gross misdemeanor convictions, no revocation of law enforcement certification, two years of law enforcement experience, to be at least 25 years old, and for those once in the military to have received at least a general discharge under honorable conditions. Additionally, it would have required sheriff candidates to complete a background check, which is already required of police chiefs and town marshals, the two other highest-ranking local law enforcement officials in a given jurisdiction.
“It actually is just a bread and butter good governance bill,” Cushman said. “It really is about having strong leadership in place that is subject to the same requirements as the rank and file.”
Aside from stricter requirements, the bill would have limited the authority of sheriff volunteers, who can assist law enforcement agencies with security at community events, traffic control, and search and rescue operations. The bill also called for sheriff candidates to complete an extensive background check — the same one mandated for peace officers —  which would then be verified by the Criminal Justice Training Commission. Both provisions drew pushback from the Washington Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs and rural constituents.

Howie, the former Wahkiakum County sheriff, opposed the bill. He said he supports more qualifications for sheriff candidates that could lead to disqualifying someone for integrity issues, but he “would not support any state-appointed political body” to conduct background checks on candidates.
“You could have somebody from the far right or the far left that is gunning for a particular candidate because they have different views,” he said. “I just wouldn’t trust that kind of system.”
Dan Bigelow, the Wahkiakum County prosecutor, agreed with Howie’s concern that the background check could be used for political purposes.
“The idea was for counties to be able to elect their own people for better or for worse,” he said. “That was how the state started out, and this seemed to be a retreat from that. Although, I gotta say, there’s some folks who I wouldn’t mind seeing knocked off.”
For police accountability advocates, the prospect of an elected sheriff with a dicey past is even more troublesome as more rural sheriffs, like those in Klickitat and Adams counties, align with the constitutional sheriffs movement — the idea that sheriffs, believed to have supreme authority in their jurisdiction, chose to enforce their own rules instead of federal or state laws. Some Washington sheriffs are flouting the state’s “sanctuary” law by helping enforce federal immigration orders. 
“Constitutional sheriffs are something that we’re worried about,” said Cushman, who testified in support of House Bill 1399 earlier this year. “[They] think they are the highest law in the land and that they interpret the law and that they are allowed to keep everybody else out of their jurisdiction, including the federal government.”
She and others advocating for stronger police accountability laws are drafting a similar bill for next session. In this new version, the bill requires sheriffs to “uphold and enforce” state law.
“There’s a lot to be said for the people, the residents of the state of Washington, to have confidence that wherever they are, their law-enforcement leader is subject to the highest standard,” Cushman said.
Cushman and her organization started drafting legislation for stricter sheriff requirements after former Pierce County Sheriff Ed Troyer was accused of falsely reporting that a newspaper carrier threatened to kill him — conduct that led the state’s attorney general to prosecute him. 
Troyer was ultimately acquitted of the false reporting charge, but records show his name was added to Pierce County’s Brady list in November 2021, roughly a year after he became sheriff. Pierce County Prosecutor Mary Robnett says his entry on the Brady list didn’t have “a huge effect” on the court.
A Brady list is a record kept by prosecutors of law enforcement officers with credibility issues such as dishonesty or misconduct that must be disclosed to defense attorneys in criminal cases. If a county sheriff was on the Brady list and testified in court, the defense could call out their misconduct in front of a jury, undermining their credibility as a witness. 
“We’re a big county, almost a million people, and he has hundreds of deputies and detectives and corrections officers work for him,” Robnett said. “He was never a witness in court.”
A Brady list designation
Bigelow, prosecuting attorney for Wahkiakum County, said if Grasseth were elected, he would go on the Brady list both due to his dishonesty as a deputy in 2009 and because of his more recent false statement to a law enforcement officer charge in 2022. Bigelow said he’s not already on the list because he’s not currently a law enforcement officer.
“He called out sick when he wasn’t sick,” said Bigelow, Wahkiakum County prosecutor. “That’s an act of dishonesty but not a crime. An act of dishonesty in his official capacity would go on the [Brady] list anyhow. What really locked it in was the conviction for a false statement to a public servant. … Those would all go on the list.”
In 2022, the Washington Association of Prosecuting Attorneys adopted a model policy advising county prosecutors to “err on the side of disclosure” when deciding whether to place someone on the Brady list. The Wahkiakum County Prosecuting Attorney’s Office said it follows this policy. 
As part of an ongoing series examining officers with credibility issues in Washington, InvestigateWest reviewed hundreds of Brady list records and found a wide variety of reasons why officers in Washington were placed on the Brady list, including having a DUI, unsatisfactory work performance, being inappropriate to co-workers, time theft, sexual assault and domestic violence, to name a few.
“If you have an officer with, for example, a history of lying, then that should be relevant in virtually every case that officer is involved with,” said Rachel Moran, a former public defender turned professor researching access to officer misconduct information at the University of St. Thomas School of Law. “But if you have an officer who has, let’s say, a conviction for a DUI, there might be very limited situations in which there’s any reason to disclose that in a particular case.
“Instances of dishonesty, false testimony, falsifying a police report, that kind of thing, are the most significant information in terms of impeaching the credibility of the officer.”
In a small county like Wahkiakum, sheriffs play a larger role due to the small size of their agency. The county only has seven deputies, including the sheriff and undersheriff. 
“It wouldn’t bode well for any sheriff’s office in our state, or anywhere, to have an elected official, the leader of that office, on the Brady list,” Howie said. “That would be very damaging.”
Based on the results of the primary election in August, Bigelow doesn’t think that will happen.
“I think that the county spoke pretty loudly in the primary about not wanting a convicted criminal to be their sheriff,” Bigelow said.

(Photo by Ryan Berry/Washington State Standard)Washington Public Lands Commissioner Dave Upthegrove defended his decision to pause some timber sales and said he will seek 2026 legislation to diversify revenue from state trust lands, arguing the state can “do more for climate and habitat while providing stability.”
In an interview on TVW’s “Inside Olympia,” Upthegrove told host Austin Jenkins that his halt on harvesting in older, “structurally complex forests” — those that have some but not all the characteristics of “old-growth”— began as a six-month hold for restoration and protection. It was intended to refresh inventory data and gather input from tribes, industry, school districts and counties. 
All but four of the 24 paused sales in such forests have been lifted. Three timber sales in the Elwha River watershed remain on hold as a condition of a budget provision requiring a study of whether conserving the surrounding forests could enhance ecosystem recovery from a dam removal before any logging can resume. A fourth sale in Kitsap County will remain paused at the county’s request as it seeks funding to purchase the sale area for conservation and recreation.
As most of the pause lifted in August, Upthegrove directed preservation of 77,000 acres while allowing logging on about 29,000 acres, a split he called a “sweet spot” to limit near-term fiscal impacts while testing new approaches. “These lands don’t belong to industry. They belong to we, the people,” he said, adding his duty is to manage in the public interest while meeting constitutional trust obligations.
The move drew both process and revenue criticisms from editorial boards and former lawmakers, while some conservationists said it didn’t go far enough. 
Upthegrove said he spent months in meetings — including with 20 of the state’s 29 tribal councils — and called the action an internal directive to staff, not a vote of the Forest Practices Board. 
He disputed claims of widespread economic harm, noting 70% of Washington’s wood supply comes from private lands and more than 90% of Department of Natural Resources timberlands are unaffected. He said ecological thinning, acquiring replacement timberlands and entering carbon-credit and other environmental markets could support rural economies.
Upthegrove said his department will propose an agency-request bill in the 2026 session to let the department take part in carbon and other “ecosystem service” markets, which turn natural assets into revenue. Those tools would not fully replace timber revenue, he said, but could become a “meaningful piece” of a diversified model.
He also urged lawmakers to restore wildfire-prevention funding that was cut last cycle. 
A 2021 framework envisioned $125 million per biennium for forest health, community resilience and response; the current budget provides about $60 million, he said. With longer seasons and more blazes on both sides of the Cascades, “without the funding restored, we’re going to see more fires and bigger fires,” Upthegrove said. 
He likened the Department of Natural Resources’ suppression role to an emergency room — “we put it out no matter what” — and cited state costs of about $500,000 a day to fight two large central Washington fires this fall.
Framing the trade-off, Upthegrove said prevention dollars can avert larger suppression bills and protect communities while his agency pilots new revenue streams: “We can do more for climate and habitat while providing stability” for schools, counties and the timber workforce.

Her victory in the primary will give Moreno a strong mandate when she enters office in January.
On Saturday during her election night party at the Civic Theater, Moreno said the early victory will give her time to assemble a good team and prepare to lead a city at a crossroads.
“The work starts tomorrow morning,” Moreno told Verite News, noting that she would pay particular attention to preparing a city budget that can help her achieve her vision.

Moreno will succeed Mayor LaToya Cantrell, who, in her second term, has been in frequent combat with the City Council that Moreno, at times, helped lead as one of two citywide representatives on the seven-member body. The council has made multiple efforts to limit Cantrell’s power, often challenging her decision-making on everything from mayoral appointees to entering into a settlement with the School Board.
However, despite their frequent differences, when asked whether she would keep any part of Cantrell’s administration in place, Moreno said yes: Cantrell’s popular health director, Dr. Jennifer Avegno, who led the city through the COVID-19 pandemic.
“I’ll be keeping Dr. Avegno, who I think does an amazing job with the Health Department,” Moreno said.
She did not provide any hint as to whether any other familiar faces would be part of her administration, even when asked whether popular councilmember Joe Giarruso would be joining her team – though she did compliment him effusively.
Moreno held a comfortable lead in both polling and campaign contributions over the course of the election season. The councilmember at-large kicked off her mayoral campaign last year, with campaign signs appearing as early as last summer, more than a year out from the election. It was a bracingly early start – and an explicit claim to the leading position she would maintain throughout the election.
Fellow councilmember Oliver Thomas also threw his hat into the ring early on in the election, announcing his campaign this spring. Thomas, who was once considered a mayoral frontrunner almost two decades ago, before a federal bribery conviction derailed his political career, had recently returned to politics representing District E on the council beginning in 2022.
As a councilmember, Thomas has been a frequent advocate for the Cantrell administration, regularly voting against overriding mayoral vetoes, whether they concerned council approval of mayoral appointees, sanitation contracts in the French Quarter or even her ability to use the city-owned Upper Pontalba Apartment. As a candidate, Thomas has promised to leverage his decades of experience to address blight and improve city services.
As the year proceeded, other candidates also entered the fray. Some were more serious contenders, like former judge Arthur Hunter. Others were less so, like disgraced former Orleans Parish Communication District executive Tyrell Morris. But all failed to meaningfully gain momentum and eat into the early lead held by Moreno.
Going into qualifying in July, many voters expected a two-man race between Moreno and Thomas, rehashing the frequent disputes the two had on the council. But then State Sen. Royce Duplessis, who had earlier announced that he would not run for mayor, changed his mind and entered the race, hoping to offer a meaningful challenge to his fellow progressive Moreno.
Duplessis, also a former statehouse representative, made a name for himself in Baton Rouge through his work reforming criminal justice, health care, worker protections and early childhood education. At the launch of his campaign, he marketed himself as the candidate who could be a real challenger to Moreno, but he entered with little cash on hand. Still, Duplessis saw an opening and hoped he could force Moreno into a runoff.
Less than a month later, Hunter, who continued to trail in the polls, would drop out and endorse Duplessis, cementing the three-way contest that has defined the election over the last two months.
Since then, there has been a marathon of forums and televised debates and questionnaires. In some ways, the candidates’ platforms look similar: All have highlighted their desire to improve city services, increase affordable housing and support the creation of new jobs. In pitching voters, they’ve each played to their strengths. Moreno has pitched herself as someone deeply attuned to the systems of City Hall, capable of implementing her progressive policies without drama or delay. Thomas as someone with deep experience in politics going back to the ‘90s, who can speak plainly and compassionately to the experiences of longtime New Orleanians, especially those impacted by the justice system. And Duplessis as an outsider uninvolved in the current battles between the City Council and the Mayor, willing to leverage his statehouse relationships to achieve his goals for the city.
Moreno first became a public figure in New Orleans through her work as an on-air journalist with WDSU-TV. She later became a state house representative, where she was known for her work championing survivors of domestic and sexual violence in a series of bills. In 2018, she joined the New Orleans City Council as an at-large member, where she became known as one of the more progressive councilmembers as she passed a reams of ordinances, most notably, helping relocate the residents of Gordon Plaza, increasing wages for city workers and promoting renewable energy.
She will become New Orleans’ second woman mayor in its history, and its first Hispanic mayor.

As Tuesday’s City Council meeting began, The Rev. Thomas Thrash delivered a prayer that set the stage for the dynamic that would play out in the council chambers.
“May truth rise above deception,” Thrash said. “May righteousness rise above greed.”

Thrash requested divine guidance to help the council consider the harm a proposed hyperscale data center could bring to Bessemer and the surrounding, rural communities in central Alabama.
After the prayer, the council got down to business. Despite vocal opposition from residents, local and state environmental groups and the NAACP, the entire council—save one absent member—voted to amend the city’s zoning code to allow the location of data centers in areas designated for light industrial use.
The decision is the first major step, following repeated delays, toward the approval of Project Marvel, a $14.4 billion hyperscale data center development set to encompass 700 acres and include 18 buildings totaling 4.5 million square feet.
The project has faced consistent, staunch opposition from residents living both within Bessemer city limits and in the rural, unincorporated areas surrounding the proposed development site. Locals have expressed concerns about excessive energy usage, increased utility rates, potential watershed contamination, habitat destruction, noise pollution and years of disruptive construction traffic.
Bessemer’s relatively small City Council chambers were packed to capacity Tuesday evening, with residents spilling into the hallway and herded into an overflow room on a different floor. The only levity in the somber crowd was a spontaneous “Roll Tide” someone interjected after the Pledge of Allegiance.
Residents in the audience were more subdued than in the numerous meetings most had attended again and again as the City Council and Bessemer’s Planning and Zoning Commission considered and reconsidered proposals involving zoning and development plans related to Project Marvel.
Before the council’s vote, President Donna Thigpen emphasized that the ordinance under consideration—a measure to allow data centers in areas with industrial zoning—wasn’t specific to Project Marvel.
“It has been suggested that there’s other properties that might be more suitable or more favorable, but to do that, even in another place, this would have to be had,” Thigpen told those gathered.
Indeed, the proposed ordinance wouldn’t simply impact the possible siting of Project Marvel on land slated to be rezoned from agricultural to light industrial use. Under the proposal, future data center projects, too, could be located in areas zoned for the latter purpose.
Before Tuesday’s vote to change Bessemer’s zoning ordinance, light industrial uses included facilities like bus terminals, gas stations with garages and large billboards. Expressly forbidden from light industrial classification are facilities “which are especially detrimental to property or to the health and safety beyond the district by reason of the emission of odor, dust, gas, fumes, smoke, noise, vibration or waste material.”
Residents have argued that commissioners should vote down the allowance of data centers in light industrial zones because the facilities simply don’t fit the definition of light industrial development and aren’t comparable to facilities that are typically permitted under that classification.
“This is not light industrial,” Becky Morgan, a resident affected by the project, previously told city officials. The facility’s high power consumption, security needs and sheer footprint should require its zoning in heavy industrial or another, newly created zoning category, she argued.

Several other residents spoke during Tuesday’s meeting to express their concerns, asking the council to more deeply research the different types of data centers, their sizes and impacts. But to their consternation, members of the overflow crowd in the downstairs waiting room at City Hall weren’t allowed to voice their views during this meeting.
Sarah Stokes, an attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, expressed her dismay that residents among the overflow crowd weren’t allowed to speak and were given no explanation from officials as to why.
“That’s not the law for the public hearing. You have to be able to be heard,” she said.
William Spencer, who owns Spencer Wood Recycling in Bessemer, was also upset by what he viewed as an effort to limit dissent. Spencer said he witnessed a police officer stop a lady in a red shirt “with force” and told her she couldn’t go upstairs to the council meeting to speak.
Ultimately, the council voted unanimously to approve the change to the city’s zoning ordinance, making way for data centers of any size and scope to be located in land zoned for light industrial use.
Spencer called the council’s rapid approval a farce.
“I think that they’re railroading,” he said. “For them to make it light industrial and give a positive spin on light industrial for something that’s heavy industrial pulling all of this diesel power, I think that it’s a farce.”
Spencer wasn’t the only one to think the fix was in before the meeting even began.
In a press release issued the day before the council’s formal vote, the Bessemer City Council reaffirmed its full support for the data center as a “tremendous investment” with economic benefits for both the city and state of Alabama.
At least one city council member has also been vocal about his support for the project, painting those opposing it as outsiders aiming to halt a project at the expense of Bessemer’s city government.
In response to a postcard by the Alabama Rivers Alliance, an environmental nonprofit, sent to Bessemer residents urging them to tell their council members to vote against the data center, City Council member Chester Porter wrote on social media that concerned citizens living outside the city limits had no place to tell Bessemer citizens what to do.
“Telling Bessemer citizens what to do with our land is like showing up at their community meeting and telling them to plant apple trees in their front yards and build swimming pools by their mailboxes,” he said.
The land involved in the proposed project hasn’t always been located within Bessemer, but was annexed into city limits in recent years. The site is located on the extreme edge of the city, about six miles from the city center.
And not everyone views concerned citizens living outside the city limits as undue, outside interference.
“Quite frankly, if we want to talk about outsiders, there’s only one person in that room upstairs that I know of that doesn’t live in Jefferson County, and that’s the developer,” said Charles Miller, policy director for Alabama Rivers Alliance.
Shelby Standfield, an architectural designer who suffers from chronic asthma, moved from Birmingham to McCalla, an incorporated area of Jefferson County adjacent to the proposed data center site, to escape poor air quality. Even though she’s not within the city limits, she goes to Bessemer to shop for all her amenities.
“Air pollution knows no boundaries. It doesn’t know where the county line is,” she said. Even though she lives ten miles away from Bessemer’s city limits, Standfield’s home is located just up the road from the site where, if approved, dozens of diesel generators could soon be located as a backup power source for the data center. “I live closer than some people who actually live in Bessemer,” she said.
Edith Hunter, a breast cancer survivor and Bessemer resident, also pushed back on the notion that those outside the city limits won’t be affected by air pollution.
“Smoke is not just going to settle in Bessemer,” she said.
She said she believes the proposed development is a “done deal” and a “money grab.”
The Bessemer City Council is expected to formally consider the data center’s development plan, one of the final steps in the approval process, at a meeting on Nov. 18.

There are steps Vermont towns can take to be better prepared regardless of the outcome of future federal declaration requests.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Chris Campany: Preparing for greater self-reliance in the wake of disaster.","This commentary is by Chris Campany, of Townshend. Campany is the executive director of the Windham Regional Commission and chair of the Vermont Planning and Development Agencies (VAPDA) Emergency Planning and Resilience Committee.


On Aug. 25, Vermont requested a federal disaster declaration to reimburse municipalities in Caledonia and Essex counties for expenses resulting from flooding on July 10. As of this writing the response is still pending. Vermonters should pay attention to whether or not a federal disaster declaration is made and, if so, what’s included; the result could be an indicator of how changes in the federal approach to disaster declarations will affect the state and what costs municipalities and local taxpayers will be expected to bear when disaster strikes. There are steps towns can take to be better prepared regardless of the outcome of future declaration requests.
Vermont state and local governments are heavily reliant upon federal funding for emergency preparedness, and disaster response and recovery. Nationally, disaster declaration requests that would have been routinely approved have been slower in coming or denied. Furthermore, federal funding for mitigation action that has traditionally accompanied federal disaster declarations through the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program is no longer a given. Vermont has relied upon this funding for property buyouts in floodplains and landslide areas, improvements to bridges and culverts, protection of floodplains and flood-proofing of buildings, among other things.
What can a municipality do to be in the best position to recover from disaster amid federal funding uncertainty?

Establish a dedicated disaster reserve fund.
Establish lines of credit before a disaster ever strikes.
Learn about public financing tools and options for mitigation projects, recovery and rebuilding.
Develop a capital improvement plan and related budget to identify and prioritize projects. At a minimum this could be a prioritized bulleted list with reasonable cost assumptions.
Use your town plan and your local hazard mitigation plan to inform your capital improvement planning.
Give serious consideration to what infrastructure must be rebuilt and what can be abandoned if damaged or destroyed, also known as “strategic abandonment.”

Hopefully federal aid will be forthcoming to the impacted communities in Caledonia and Essex counties. However, each of these actions will serve a municipality well regardless of how the federal policy and funding realm evolves over the coming weeks, months and years.

Truth telling
Ursa Goldenrose, 16, Hardwick
     We manifest our fear in our hands, as a physical thing. Sometimes it pricks at our skin and leaves marks; sometimes it results in stiff fingers, cracking from a stiffened clench. The keyboard invites an unbeknownst realization to form, almost as if the clacking of the keys – spelling out the words of some reality – is the only thing to make the phenomenon itself real. When focus is placed on the fingertips, they jump and skip, and while they rearrange the saddest words, they also often confide a confidence that allows them to be free.
  What we write pulls our fear out from underneath our hearts. Steady hands solidify each sound so that when the words are read aloud, they ring with truth and vitality. Sometimes these scribbles seem to be the only proof of our surviving those smaller mortalities.

,Mississippi Today,2025-10-12 11:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Government shutdown rhetoric begs the question: Should the sick and injured be denied emergency care?,Bobby Harrison,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/10/12/government-shutdown-sick-injured-medical-care/,"Since the presidency of Ronald Reagan, federal law has required hospitals to provide emergency treatment to all who need it, regardless of whether they are U.S. citizens.","Based on the ongoing rhetoric surrounding the federal government shutdown, perhaps it is time to ask the question.
The question is, do we – the United States of America –  really want undocumented immigrants receiving medical treatment in our hospital emergency rooms?
If a non-citizen falls off a roof of a house while doing carpentry work, do we want to transport him to the hospital or just leave him in the yard to fend for himself – broken legs and all? If a non-citizen child is sick, should she be provided emergency care?
Under current law signed in 1986 by President Ronald Reagan, the answer is yes to providing emergency care.
Hospitals, if they receive federal funds, are obligated to provide “stabilizing care” in their emergency rooms to all who show up, including undocumented immigrants.
The issue is worth discussing now because Republicans, led by U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, are complaining that Democrats are shutting down the federal government demanding federal funds to provide health care to undocumented immigrants.
U.S. Rep. Mike Ezell of Mississippi’s 4th District wrote on social media, “Senate Democrats failed America. They shut down the government because we refused to give free healthcare to people who broke our laws to get here.”
U.S. Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith of Mississippi reposted the Senate Republicans proclaiming, “Senate Democrats are putting illegal aliens ahead of our troops and American families in need.”
In reality, the issue that led Democrats to oppose the continuing resolution to fund the federal government and thus leading to the shutdown has little to do with illegal immigrants. Instead, Democrats are trying to extend federal subsidies that make insurance policies purchased through the federal Affordable Care Act exchanges dramatically cheaper than they would otherwise be.
If the subsidies are not extended before the end of the year, the cost of insurance will go up on average $480 annually for the estimated 285,000 Mississippians on the exchange, according to KFF, a national nonprofit health care research organization. The premiums will go up much more for some Mississippians.
Some Republicans counter that they will discuss the subsidies once the government is funded. But the main talking point for many Republican lawmakers is that the Democrats want free health care for non-citizens. 
Under federal law, undocumented immigrants are not eligible to receive coverage through federal health care plans, such as Medicare, Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program. Republicans had a chance to take up that issue when they passed what they called the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” earlier this year at the urging of President Donald Trump. They did not.
Granted some states – yes, California _ do use their own state funds to provide health care for undocumented immigrants. Congressional Republicans considered trying to penalize those states for using their own money to provide health insurance for undocumented people, but opted not to in the big bill that President Trump signed into law in July.
While undocumented immigrants do not get health care through any federal program, hospitals do receive compensation for treating in their emergency rooms people, including non-citizens, without insurance and with limited ability to pay.
Trump’s big bill reduced the amount of compensation hospital emergency rooms receive for treating undocumented immigrants. That reduction hurts the hospitals, not the undocumented immigrants who the hospitals still must treat if they show up in emergency rooms.
Hospitals are partially reimbursed for the uncompensated care they give to help ensure their financial sustainability and help hold down the cost of health care for Americans. Without the federal assistance, hospitals could be forced to close or reduce services or increase costs for those with the ability to pay through private insurance or through other means.
So, if congressional Republicans and President Trump are complaining about Democrats trying to provide health care for undocumented immigrants, perhaps the options should be discussed.
One option was the big bill’s reduction of money going to the hospitals to treat undocumented people. This option penalizes hospitals and potentially those with insurance or the ability to pay. The alternative would be to provide adequate federal funds for the care that federal law mandates the hospitals provide.
Another option is to stop requiring hospital emergency rooms to treat undocumented immigrants. That could save a lot of money.
How does the United States of America, a country where a majority of people claim some type of religious views, want to address that issue?
Perhaps it is time to cut through the rhetoric and ask that question.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/07045727/U.S.-Capitol.jpeg,,,2025-10-12 07:58:06.521880

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Gilman grapples with its identity as rail is poised to return.","LUNENBURG — The inconceivable is happening in Gilman: Rail is returning to the former mill community.
Early this year, news broke that Vermont Rail System planned to reopen a then-defunct section of railroad that runs from one of its freight lines in northern New Hampshire across the Connecticut River into Gilman. The rail company is in the process of clearing and reconstructing that section of track, as well as negotiating with rail giant CSX to purchase the rest of the line, which runs approximately 20 miles from Gilman to St. Johnsbury.
The plans, however, have been a shock to community members in Gilman, a village in Lunenburg that once thrived because of the local mill and adjoining railroad, but became a shadow of itself when the last freight trains passed through in the late 1990s. Around the same time, the paper mill closed.
The mill reopened in 2004, but abruptly shut down in June 2007, with 115 workers immediately laid off, according to a website run by the power company that now owns the property. At present, the mill property primarily consists of a hydroelectric dam and solar energy fields, but its owner is seeking tenants — including those who might benefit from a rail connection.
As the two historic economic pillars of Gilman work to reestablish themselves, community members are grappling with the pending impact on their lives and their town.
‘Pretty pissed’
Annika Chaffee and her husband are two of many Gilman residents whose houses or yards back up to the tracks. The couple bought their house a decade ago, choosing the location because it was quiet and a good place to raise kids while still being close to larger population centers, Chaffee said. The property is sandwiched between the road and the railroad; during an August visit, one of their children played on a swingset abutting the rusty rails.
The Chaffees’ kids used to play on the tracks, which, in mid-August, were in the process of being reclaimed by nature. Trees and brush grew around and through the rail, and Chaffee said the family regularly saw bears and moose on their game cameras.
In the months since, Vermont Rail System has cleared vegetation almost all the way to the mill.
When she first heard the news of the railroad’s return, Chaffee said she was “pretty pisssed.”
“If my husband’s job wasn’t so good, I’d say, ‘let’s head to Maine,’” she said. “But we’ve invested so much into our house, we’ve got so much going with the community. … I don’t want to leave.”
Chaffee said she worries about the many unknowns: how often trains will run, if there will be noise in the middle of the night, if the rail cars will transport chemicals, what would happen if there’s an accident — and if her family’s property value will decrease.
The rail corridor includes 33 feet on each side of the tracks, though many in Gilman have utilized that space for decades, including for walks. In August, a hammock even hung directly over the tracks in the center of the village, near the mill.
That corridor makes up more than half of the Chaffees’ backyard. 
“We would lose a lot if they decided to impose all 33 feet,” she said.
So far, adjacent property owners haven’t heard from Vermont Rail System about its plans directly — local approvals are not needed — and must sit with their uncertainties.
“If the railroad is going to benefit us, great,” Chaffee said. “But if it’s just going to tear the whole town apart, and you lose too many good people, then that’s problematic.”

Rail as an economic driver
Vermont Rail System, a family-owned company based in Burlington, operates more than 400 miles of track in Vermont and adjoining states. While it runs a passenger “dinner train” in the Champlain Valley during the summer and fall and Amtrak uses some of its rail lines, the company’s main business is freight.
Selden Houghton, president of Vermont Rail System, said Thursday that the company has some interested freight clients in the Gilman area, as well as customers in northern New Hampshire that are presently trucking their product from the rail’s current end in Vermont. Houghton said a lot of the goods being moved are in the forest industry but he thinks “there’s some other markets that will evolve as well.”
The company’s goal is to reestablish the connection between its rail line in northern New Hampshire and the rest of its network in St. Johnsbury, where Vermont Rail System owns track. Currently, Houghton said, the company sometimes has to send equipment all the way up into Québec and then back down into Vermont.
“If you look at the map, it makes sense why we want to do it,” he said.

Houghton said Vermont Rail System hopes to be running trains into Gilman within a year and that negotiations with CSX are ongoing; he is “optimistic” they will figure something out. However, Houghton noted, the rail corridor west of Gilman into St. Johnsbury is much more overgrown and has more significant washouts than the section into Gilman. The company plans to look to federal infrastructure grants to reopen that section of rail line.
The biggest reason for the project, he said, is to spur economic growth in the Northeast Kingdom and northern New Hampshire.
“If we can get competitive rail service reestablished by getting the New Hampshire Central Railroad that we purchased connected to the rest of the VRS system, it just opens up a tremendous amount of opportunities to put business on rail and get it off the road,” he said.
Houghton’s best guess is that trains will run through Gilman several times a week, initially, during daylight hours. However, he said, it really all depends on customers’ needs. Vermont Rail System’s nearby line from Newport to Wells River currently runs a train most days of the week during daylight hours, but used to do so twice daily, he said.
In terms of the myriad of pieces of personal property on the rail corridor through Gilman, Houghton said the company is going to initially clear things enough to move trains, but they “certainly need to address any encroachments” at some point. Typically, he said, brush is cut back the full 33-foot distance from the center line on each side of the tracks.
“You never know, based on business needs, what part of the corridor you may want to put a siding in,” he said, referring to a low-speed section of track next to the main line that is used for loading or storing rail vehicles. “It is private property.”

‘Everything needs to be done in balance’
While many are wary, some in Gilman are excited about the return of the trains.
Jacob Fournier has lived in Gilman his whole life and has a great passion for rail, originating from watching the trains go by the windows of Gilman’s middle school in the mid-1990s.
“It was a lot more exciting to watch the trains out the window than it was to pay attention to class,” he said. In August, Fournier said he was “cautiously optimistic” about the return of rail to town, though he noted he does not live by the tracks and is not directly affected like the Chaffees.
“A lot of rail proponents and fans of rail, I think, had sort of resigned themselves to the fact that (the railroad through Gilman) probably was going to get torn up and turned into a trail,” he said. “So the fact that VRS feels like they see a path forward to developing enough business to make it worthwhile to invest in the lines has certainly made us, you know — we’d like to see the trains come back.”
Fournier was referring to the Twin State Rail Trail Project, a collaboration between Vermont and New Hampshire snowmobile clubs and other trail organizations that had planned to connect the Lamoille Valley Rail Trail in St. Johnsbury to the Presidential and Ammonoosuc Rail Trails in New Hampshire via the very rail corridor now in the process of reactivation.
Initially stunned, organizers are now working with Vermont Rail System on possible designs for a recreational trail running next to the rail line for a short but important portion of reactivated track in Whitefield, New Hampshire. They hope this approach, used in other parts of Vermont such as the Burlington bike path, might be possible along other parts of the route.
“Everything needs to be done in balance,” Fournier said. “As a proponent of rail, I don’t want to see the community’s needs for recreational opportunities ignored or steamrolled over.”
Vermont Rail System’s rail revival is also having a striking impact on nearby communities, most notably in Whitefield, New Hampshire, where the unexpected reactivation has stalled a multimillion-dollar library expansion project.

‘Opportunity for connection and innovation’
Kate Baxter is chair of the local task force on Outdoor Recreation, Trails & Tourism, whose members — including Chaffee and Fournier — hold a multitude of viewpoints on the return of rail to town. The group was created during the Vermont Council on Rural Development’s community visit process, which Lunenburg participated in late last year around the same time the rail’s reactivation was announced.
Selectboard meeting minutes from last summer reveal an initial upwelling of community opposition, including a petition against the return of the rail. According to Baxter, the majority of residents — especially those who live on the rail corridor — would rather have seen the former railroad just turn into trees, communal land or the previously planned rail trail.
Now, however, they are focused on making the best of the situation.
As part of the task force, Baxter said she has spent a lot of time communicating with Vermont Rail System about its plans and progress, as well as meeting with residents to collect their feedback and share it with the rail company. In mid-September, she helped organize a meet and greet with several members of Vermont Rail System’s staff.
“I think it was helpful for people to … recognize this as a real thing that’s happening,” she said on Sept. 18. “I think there’s still a huge number of people who don’t even know. Maybe they’ve noticed the trees being cleared, maybe they haven’t.”
The task force has identified a number of proposals to share with Vermont Rail System, including one to retain community access to the Connecticut River and a number of trails alongside it that are reached by crossing the tracks. Later this month, Baxter plans to visit potential crossing locations with the Vermont Rail System team.
According to Baxter, Vermont Rail System said they are “confident” they can work out a crossing  — if there is financing.
“With collaboration of different stakeholders, I am hopeful we can achieve that,” Baxter said in an email. “Overall, VRS seems amenable to creative ideas in general if financing is there.”
Gathered proposals also call for low fencing alongside residential properties to bar animals and children from the rail.
“Every challenge is an opportunity for connection and innovation,” Baxter said. “It’s important to listen to all the different sides so that we can come to some sort of a future that is beneficial for everyone, so that we’re not just a pass-through (place) in the middle of nowhere.”

Mill space for lease
The other historic economic pillar of town, the defunct paper mill, was bought by Ampersand Energy Partners in 2008 and reopened as a hydroelectric power plant. The Boston-based company — which owns and operates small hydro and solar power facilities — has constructed one solar field on an adjoining property and recently notified the Lunenburg Selectboard that it would like to create another solar field on the mill site.
The mill building itself, however, has remained vacant since its purchase, despite several failed plans for new use or improved power infrastructure. Currently, a website advertises space for lease in the “Gilman Business Park,” where the developer is “willing to build to suit on currently empty lots.” According to the website, light manufacturing companies, forest and agricultural product businesses and commercial enterprises would do well at the location.
Annabelle Blake, a spokesperson for Ampersand, said in an email that the company has “had interest from prospective parties” and believes the mill “holds strong potential for strategic investment and long-term community benefit.” Blake added that Ampersand strongly supports the restart of rail operations, which “will bring increasing environmentally friendly options for transportation for potential tenants of the former Gilman mill.”
Fournier said he’d like to see the mill get some use.
“It will never be a paper mill again like it was,” he said. “But if having rail transportation gets a couple smaller businesses in here that can create 10 or 15 or 20 or 30 jobs, that just helps diversify the economy.”

Who will benefit?
During the heyday of Gilman’s mill and the railroad, community benefit was clear: the entities employed locals, paid taxes and created a vibrancy in town. There was an ice skating rink and warming hut along with tennis courts and a hotel, Baxter said. Others remember a bowling alley, train station, union hall and restaurant — all of which disappeared with the mill’s decline.
But now, many residents are wondering how the resurrection of these former economic pillars will benefit the community, and how their quality of life — including access to nature and recreational areas — will change with the rail’s revival.
“We don’t want to have industry come that doesn’t give us jobs or that doesn’t feed our community,” Baxter said.
However, most doubt the rail line or the mill will bring much benefit in the near future in terms of taxes or jobs, Baxter said. In fact, Ampersand requested (though was denied) a tax abatement on the mill property last year.
One thing the community is excited about, though, is having functional railroad infrastructure and someone to call when it fails. During last summer’s flooding, unmaintained railroad drainage ditches plugged up and contributed to washed-out roads.
“No one would return phone calls until these people bought the track,” said Meagan Forbes, who owns property abutting the railroad. “(Vermont Rail System) has been very responsive, but we all have that concern: are they going to maintain it? How long are they going to be around before they go out of business?”
“We want to see something that’s sustainable,” Baxter echoed.
To that end, Baxter has been pushing for a public meeting with the rail company and New Hampshire and Vermont’s transportation agencies, hoping to put the community’s voice at the table.
“I get it: corporations, businesses need to make money, and that’s where their interest is coming from,” said Baxter. “But we taxpayers … we as community members also have a vested interest in this space. We pay for roads, those different elements, and we live here and we want other people to live with us here and enjoy this space.”

TOWNS STATEWIDE — As tourists and Vermont residents alike set out on the state’s many hiking trails to admire the fall colors, they’ll find the vast majority of trails open as usual for foot travel. But this year’s drought coming after two prior years of damaging flooding has made upkeep and management of trails more challenging. 
Much of Vermont remains in severe to extreme drought, according to the National Integrated Drought Information System. That’s a sharp contrast to flooding in 2024 and especially 2023 that caused extensive damage including to trails.

The flood to drought scenario complicates trail repairs and improvements.
Waterbars, a key piece of infrastructure to control rainwater flow near trails, are difficult to install both when the soil is too dry and when the soil is too wet.
Stone stairs, which are necessary to slow erosion and help hikers get up steep, rocky stretches, are another piece of infrastructure that is difficult to construct in both droughts and post-flood conditions. 
“In wetter years like last year it was easier to see where water would flow or sit in the trail and therefore where we needed to add these structures,” said Molly Belvo, a Green Mountain Club trail crew leader.
This year it’s been so dry that trail workers have to try and picture where the water will go.
“We can see places that may be problematic in a heavy rain year, but without actually seeing it (now) we definitely could be missing areas,” Belvo said.
Droughts are a major concern on the trail this year. Trail advisories to carry more water when going on hikes have been issued this summer and fall, especially if hikers are spending the night on trail.  
While dry trails are more likely to remain compact to help prevent erosion, the long term risks that come with drought can be concerning to the future of the trail. On top of that, the Green Mountain Club has put out warnings against lighting outdoor fires since early August as the drought turns forest understories into timberboxes.
Floods in 2023 and in 2024 destroyed trails and trail infrastructure.
Roads, bridges, and trails were washed out or damaged in the floods and access roads to trailheads were destroyed.
“I think it’s going to take years to fix all of the damage from the storm events,” said Mike DeBonis, executive director of the Green Mountain Club, the Waterbury-based nonprofit that manages over 500 miles of trails in Vermont.
Floods that last only a day or two can lead to erosion levels typically seen only after five or more years of weathering.
“If those floods happened every 10 or 20 years, that’s one thing, but if it’s happening every two or three years do we really have the capacity with our current volunteers to maintain those trails to the standard we strive for?” DeBonis said. 
Every year, volunteers help repair and maintain trails and build infrastructure to help prevent future damage. 
This infrastructure is not cheap. A three-year trail improvement project on the popular Burrows Trail up Camel’s Hump that was completed last fall cost approximately $700,000. The Green Mountain Club and the Vermont Department of Forests, Parks and Recreation led the work. 
You can’t do that big of a project everywhere, DeBonis said.
“I think one of the things we have to do is be smart and identify those areas that are at the greatest risk and will benefit the most from large scale investment,” he added.
Changes in federal funding also impact trail work.
“AmeriCorps funding cuts cut out certain aspects of our funding,” said Anna Montesanti, the conservation project coordinator at Vermont Youth Conservation Corps, a nonprofit conservation and agriculture organization based in Richmond.

Funding is not the only barrier to successful trail restoration. The same weather events that cause trail restoration to be necessary also greatly affect trail restoration efforts.
Both drought and heavy rains complicate building of waterbars and other necessary infrastructure. If the soil is too dry, stones used in infrastructure might not ‘suction’ into the holes and can be unstable. If the soil is too wet, the holes dug to put the stones in might fill with sediment and water before stones are able to be properly set, which can cause the rocks to not sit correctly in the ground. 
The availability of crews to lead trail restoration is also at risk.
“People are booking us several years in advance for some projects,” Montesanti said.
Planning and organizing restoration efforts is complicated when natural disasters can strike anytime and there is already so much damage to repair.
“(We) are trying to build with the thought in mind that there will be new disasters,” Montesanti added. 
So what’s the best way to help Vermont’s trails? Volunteering with the Green Mountain Club and local land trusts is one way, according to DeBonis. Donating to trail organizations and also advocating for government funds to go to trail restoration is also important, trail groups say. 
It’s also important to stay off damaged trails impacted by weather events and follow advisories such as the Green Mountain Club’s guidelines.

“Last year ... we served 12,789 in Royalton and in Strafford we did 2,620,” said South Royalton Senior Center executive director Sue Pirie. ""It’s all by donation — we don’t charge.”

This story by Maryellen Apelquist was first published in The Herald on Oct. 9, 2025.
Along with food came unbridled laughter as volunteers-turned-friends in Royalton wound down the clock to a noontime meal on Tuesday for seniors.
The lunch preppers, themselves senior citizens in their 70s and 80s, hustled and bustled in the warm kitchen of Royalton Academy—some, like chef Tony Perkins, since 5:30 a.m.
One wrested a deep bowl of hot potatoes from an old Hobart floor-standing mixer. Another sliced servings from four large sheet pans of pineapple cake baked fresh that morning. Others washed pots and pans and pitched in wherever directed by Perkins, a military veteran and retired court reporter of 38 years who also spent 15 years as a professional cake decorator.
They recalled tidbits of conversations overheard at lunches past: “I’m sorry I didn’t introduce you but I didn’t remember your name,” brought howls of laughter. And volunteer Larry Parmenter of South Royalton rolled with quips: When another volunteer yelped “Ouch!” in the kitchen, Parmenter offered a helpful “I didn’t feel a thing.”
Linda Fadden of South Royalton, a former nurse who worked at Dartmouth Hitchcock for 36 years, said she “failed at retirement a couple times,” a sentiment echoed by Perkins and other hardworking members of the brigade.

The senior center gig is a good time all around, said 89-year-old Marge Turner of East Bethel. “I love being down here. I love just getting [out]. I can’t stay at home—it would drive me crazy,” said Turner as she washed dishes.
The kitchen crew was making food not just for the weekly congregate lunch — 25 pounds of ground beef for Tuesday’s stroganoff — but also to support the South Royalton Senior Center’s other programs that help to ensure food access for older community members in the White River Valley towns of Royalton, Bethel, Sharon and Strafford. Programs include home-delivery Meals on Wheels and a grab-and-go curbside service, which started during the COVID-19 pandemic.
With some seniors receiving meals for all seven days of the week, having variety available in the center’s freezer is key, said South Royalton Senior Center executive director Sue Pirie, who manages the business side of things. Pirie also leads the centers in Chelsea and Strafford.
“So when we do a meal, we do 60 to 90 extra and freeze them, and they’re all labeled,” said Pirie during a tour of the packaged meals side of the operation, as she pointed out a cooler being prepped for a recipient. “And then that way, like, this person is getting six meals, so they’ll have different meals every day.”
In addition to the meal programs, Pirie plans trips for seniors and oversees other services and partnerships, such as with Central Vermont Council on Aging.
Her centers’ joint October newsletter includes a robust and filling-sounding menu — roast pork, homemade baked beans, hearty lasagna — and is likewise full of opportunities. An upcoming trip includes a Christmas show in Portsmouth, N.H., and lunch in Kittery, Maine. CVCOA offerings include “Creative Care Kits,” which are projects that can be picked up and completed at home.
October also means it’s annual-meeting time for the centers, and Pirie on Tuesday was reviewing numbers for the previous fiscal year.
“Last year, which would have been as of September 30, we served 12,789 in Royalton and in Strafford we did 2,620,” she said. “It’s all by donation, so we do a lot of fundraising. We’re looking for grants, that type of stuff. It’s all by donation — we don’t charge.”
All in, a pre-packaged meal by the center costs $12 to produce. That figure factors in things like the packaging, which is compostable, and payroll.
Pirie, who lives in Chelsea and has been doing similar work for 25 years, expressed gratitude to the donors, including the center’s dozen board members and local farmers who donate squash.
While the senior centers receive some state and federal funding, that support feels tenuous.
“We can’t depend on that. You know how things are changing, which is not good,” she said. “They’re worried about their insurance. They’re worried about a lot. And the way I feel, seniors should be the last ones to be cut. …They’ve worked all their lives. We should be helping them, just like the veterans. We should be helping them. We shouldn’t be penalizing.”
In the dining room Tuesday in Royalton, while lunch was served at noon, guests started rolling in before 10:30 a.m. They took coffee or tea and caught up with neighbors they perhaps hadn’t seen since the Tuesday before.

There’s nothing quite like it where she lives in Florida, said seasonal Bethel resident Martine Weaver. “I don’t know of any senior center in Florida,” she said. “The whole thing, it’s all different. We entertain in our homes.”
Weaver agreed with her tablemates on one attractive aspect of the meal: food cooked by someone else tastes better. The social opportunity afforded by the lunch is also a big draw. “You have good conversation,” said Marilyn Pratt of Bethel. “And I never leave hungry, and I’m a big eater.”
While the center’s dining room was largely full come lunchtime, Perkins, who works about 15 hours a week and also cooks for the Chelsea center, wants readers to know there is still plenty of room at the table, and he’s eager for everyone to try his food.
“Everyone seems to like everything I’ve cooked so far,” said the chef, who estimates he has somewhere between 600 and 700 cookbooks and is known for his whoopie pies and fancy chocolates. “But I think one of the favorite meals is the roast pork dinner.”
Barbara Hart, 93, of Bethel offered her compliments to the chef. “The food is great,” she said. “They haven’t served anything I haven’t liked.”
Senior meals available in the White River Valley are offered by the Chelsea Senior Center, Greater Randolph Senior Center, Orange East Senior Center, Quin-Town Senior Center in Hancock, South Royalton Senior Center and South Strafford Senior Center.

They have sparked concerns about[...]","Four different employees at the Kearney Youth Rehabilitation and Treatment Center are alleged to have had inappropriate sexual contact with teenagers in custody at the center. Prosecutors have charged one of those employees with sexual abuse of a protected person. (Lori Potter for the Flatwater Free Press)At least two staff members at the juvenile treatment center in Kearney have resigned, another is on leave, and a fourth faces a criminal charge in connection with allegations of inappropriate sexual contact with teenagers in state custody.
Two of the cases involve months-old allegations, revealed in recent court proceedings. They have sparked concerns about a potential “systemic problem” at the center and prompted the Douglas County Public Defender’s Office to start reviewing its cases involving clients housed at the center.
In one teen’s case, a judge wrote that she was “disgusted and disturbed as to the lack of transparency in this matter.” She ordered the state to relocate the teen to a different center. And she directed all juveniles at state centers with cases before her to appear in person with enough time for private conversations with their lawyers.
The recent court filings and proceedings have referenced at least four current or former Kearney staff members in connection with incidents involving three teens at the center.
In a statement, the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services, which operates the state’s youth centers, said it takes every allegation seriously and investigates every claim of abuse.
“DHHS has a zero-tolerance policy towards all forms of sexual abuse, sexual harassment or sexual assault. Staff are required to cooperate fully with investigations when allegations are made.”
The allegations, though, proved extensive enough that Douglas County Public Defender Tom Riley said lawyers in his office will examine the treatment of the county’s juveniles housed there — approximately 20 boys — to determine if they want alternative placement.
“Given the very disturbing information that’s come out over the last week and a half or so, it appears that there could be a systemic problem at Kearney,” Riley said.
Kearney is one of three Youth Rehabilitation and Treatment Centers, or YRTCs, that serve juvenile offenders 14 through 18 years old who are placed there by the courts.
Court records show that Douglas County Juvenile Court Judge Amy Schuchman learned during a mid-September hearing that a 17-year-old at the Kearney center had been “in a relationship” with a 23-year-old staff member.
Later that same month, Schuchman learned that an 18-year-old at the same center had disclosed “incidents of sexual assault” by a different staff member, according to a court order.
In both cases, YRTC leaders learned of the alleged misconduct months earlier, but the state didn’t disclose it to probation officials, the boys’ attorneys or the judge.
In the 18-year-old’s case, March emails between YRTC staff and the Nebraska State Patrol showed a cellphone was found with “nude pictures and videos of youth at the facility” and “nude content” from a female staff member, according to an order.
Riley said it appears the employee provided the phone to several teens at the center.
Text messages showed “inappropriate text communication for an ongoing period of time,” with the woman referring to the teen as her “future hubby” and asking whether he’d live with her after he was released. (The staffer is not being named in print, because she has not been charged with a crime.)
The state didn’t disclose any of that information, though the teen had appeared in court in July for an unrelated hearing, according to the court order.
“This Court is disgusted and disturbed as to the lack of transparency in this matter and cannot say that continued commitment to the YRTC at this time would” be in the 18-year-old’s best interest, Schuchman wrote.
The staff member has resigned from the YRTC, according to court proceedings.
For months, officials at the state-run Kearney Youth Rehabilitation and Treatment Center did not disclose allegations of inappropriate sexual contact involving staff members and teenagers in custody at the center. (Lori Potter for the Flatwater Free Press)
In the 17-year-old’s case, YRTC officials substantiated allegations in April. Evidence included a “sexually graphic written conversation” and “sexually graphic videos” between the teen and staff member.
But the center didn’t report the allegations directly to law enforcement and — despite knowing about the allegations at the time of an earlier hearing — it didn’t report them to probation until just before the September hearing.
In both cases, Schuchman ordered the state to move the boys to another facility. On Oct. 2, she issued a broader order requiring that any youth committed to a YRTC be transported to court for their hearings with “ample time for them to consult with their attorneys” and other adults.
At a hearing Wednesday, lawyers and Schuchman pressed DHHS staff about the department’s handling of the 17-year-old’s case.
The staffer initially reported the teen for inappropriate touching, according to Shaylee Fortner, a DHHS facility compliance administrator. (The staffer has not been charged with a crime.)
Within days, a compliance manager reviewed the graphic note and video surveillance, the staff member was placed on paid suspension and she resigned, according to DHHS staff testimony. After further investigation, the compliance manager contacted the Child Abuse and Neglect Hotline, according to Fortner.
“I do not believe my team directly notified anybody else, externally,” she said.
An internal, non-criminal investigation determined the staff member had merely allowed inappropriate contact with the 17-year-old to continue for too long before reporting it, according to Fortner. YRTC’s determination didn’t change as more information surfaced, though Fortner said her office contacted the hotline a second time.
YRTC Kearney reprimanded the 17-year-old, giving him a “major violation for sexual harassment,” which was reported to his attorney and others in a monthly progress letter. The letter didn’t mention any details of the allegations or relationship with the staff member, according to testimony.
When the 17-year-old’s lawyer called his client’s living unit manager, Steven Huffman, to ask about the incident, Huffman told the lawyer that he wouldn’t believe anything the boy said. At the time of the phone call, Huffman had already seen the video surveillance and graphic note.
In court, the boy’s lawyer asked Huffman why he said that he shouldn’t believe his client.
“I really don’t have an answer for you,” Huffman responded.
As a result of the incident, Huffman said he now does more training with new employees about boundaries.

Under state law, it’s a felony to subject someone in DHHS custody to sexual contact. Consent is not a defense. DHHS’s own policy requires the YRTC to contact the State Patrol if evidence supports criminal prosecution, according to testimony.
But Fortner, the DHHS facility compliance administrator, said the video footage only substantiated allegations that the youth touched the staff member.
“We reviewed … copious amounts of video, and we only ever found incidents of him touching her inappropriately outside of the clothing,” Fortner said.
Under questioning, though, Fortner acknowledged that the video showed the staff member smiling and laughing while the teen touched her. And Fortner confirmed that the confiscated note included the staff and youth talking about sex acts and her writing that she likes it when he’s jealous.
Judge Schuchman asked Fortner: “You’ve said several times that, when you reviewed video, you only found incidents of (the youth) touching the staff. But are you aware that that could also be a crime? That sexual contact, as defined by the Nebraska statutes, can be the touching by the victim of the actor’s sexual or intimate parts or the clothing covering it — are you aware of that?”
“I would have to say no,” Fortner replied.
Denis Lemus, the teen’s attorney, said in an emailed statement that progress reports often include that children need to take accountability for their actions rather than avoid negative consequences. It seems the center doesn’t “practice what it preaches,” he said.
“The offending staff member was allowed to resign, while they used the incident as the catalyst to set back my client’s progress at the facility, thereby prolonging his stay,” Lemus said. “I am disheartened, and frankly sickened, that the YRTC seems more concerned with trying to protect [its] reputation than trying to protect the children in their care.”
In its statement, DHHS said it complies with requirements and procedures laid out in state and federal law and adheres to standards set by the American Correctional Association.
Once abuse is reported, the department immediately separates the teen from the implicated staff member, who is escorted off the property, according to DHHS. The teen is provided immediate medical and mental health care, and the department reports each case to the abuse and neglect hotline. Reports are sent to law enforcement for investigation. The department cooperates with the Nebraska State Patrol and follows protocol to notify the Office of Inspector General and probation.

Two additional cases surfaced during the questioning Wednesday.
Fortner said she very recently learned that a confidential reporter had called the child abuse hotline alleging inappropriate sexual contact between the same 17-year-old and another Kearney staffer. It prompted a new investigation and alert to the State Patrol, Fortner said. That staffer is now on paid suspension, according to Fortner.
And in September, authorities charged former Kearney YRTC staff member Martha Ruiz Palacios, 28, with second-degree sexual abuse of a protected individual. Court filings allege she had sexual contact with a 16-year-old at the center sometime between July 31 and Aug. 2. Ruiz Palacios’ employment with the department ended Aug. 4, according to DHHS. She is scheduled to appear in court Oct. 17.
At one point during Wednesday’s hearing, Schuchman asked Fortner how many staff members since March 2025 had resigned or been fired due to “inappropriate sexual allegations.”
Fortner said she didn’t know.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-12 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"In some CT towns, clouds form over new solar developments",John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/12/ct-solar-power-gravel-pit-pushback/,Experts warn the pushback against solar could threaten CT's ability to meet its long-term commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.,"The first time Chris Dahl heard rumblings of a plan to build a large solar array among the corn fields and tobacco sheds of East Windsor, she said the project sounded like a good enough idea.
A portion of the land slated for development included a sand and gravel quarry that had become an attractive hangout for underage drinkers and ATV riders, much to the displeasure of local residents and town officials.
Plus, Dahl said, the project promised to produce gobs of clean, carbon-free electricity  — the kind of mission that she and her wife, Robin Chesky, had supported by installing solar panels on the roof of their own home in town.
Dahl wasn’t alone in her initial feelings about the project, which even adopted a name highlighting its adaptive reuse of the old quarry: Gravel Pit Solar.
Local officials also threw their support behind it, citing the project’s benefits to the town as well as Connecticut’s broader effort to shift away from its reliance on older fuel-burning power plants. While testifying in favor of Gravel Pit Solar’s application before state regulators in 2020, East Windsor First Selectman Jason Bowsza said the community was “very supportive of renewable energy projects, especially when the projects make sense for us.”
“This is not going to be something that becomes an eyesore,” he added.
But by the time Gravel Pit Solar began to take shape in late 2021, Dahl and others were having second thoughts.

They grew alarmed as they watched construction spread beyond the gravel pit area onto hundreds of acres of surrounding farmland. Trees and shrubs were cleared to make way for solar panels, and workers erected a wire fence around the site, which Dahl said she feared would block the movement of local wildlife.
The first she time drove over a hill and witnessed the extent of the project, Dahl said she began to cry. 
“It just overwhelmed me,” she said. “Gone was the farmland. Gone was the open space, now it was filled with panels … It was really unexpected for me, and I think other people have had similar experiences.”
With an output of up to 120 megawatts, Gravel Pit Solar is by far the largest solar array in Connecticut and one of the largest in New England. Its thousands of panels are enough to cover more than 350 football fields and are capable of producing roughly one-quarter of all the existing utility-scale solar power in the state. The site runs from Apothecaries Hall and Windsorville roads on the north side to Plantation Road on the south, according to the site plans. 
Its construction has made East Windsor the forerunner in the state’s charge toward solar energy development. Surrounding towns, too, have joined in the bonanza with other large arrays sprouting up on former farm fields throughout the region. 
After initially welcoming the Gravel Pit project, however, many residents and local officials now say they’ve soured on the town’s status as a hotbed for the solar industry. Critics have accused developers of snatching up farmland, altering the rural character of the town and ignoring local concerns about noise and safety.
And East Windsor isn’t the only Connecticut community where solar opposition is on the rise. Experts warn the growing pushback could threaten the state’s ability to meet its long-term commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by deploying new, cleaner forms of electricity generation.
Still, solar developers haven’t slowed down.

Roughly a month after commencing full operations in April, Gravel Pit’s developers, DESRI Holdings, filed a request with the Connecticut Siting Council to expand the existing facility by another 30 megawatts onto adjacent properties. The company has also revealed its plans to build a second 100-megawatt facility, Saltbox Solar, on farmland in the towns of East Windsor and Ellington.
“Connecticut needs additional power to meet future demand, and state law requires all electricity to come from renewable sources by 2040,” the company said in a statement.
“Regulators determine how to balance those needs with local concerns,” the statement continued. “DESRI is proud to help provide affordable, clean power to the state by developing projects that are consistent with state policy and is committed to engaging local communities throughout the process.”
In an effort to marshal the local opposition to solar expansion, Dahl and Chesky formed East Windsor Residents for Responsible Solar Development and have been collecting hundreds signatures from people urging the Siting Council to reject the latest proposal.
Their efforts have attracted the support of state lawmakers — even some who strongly support the state’s clean-energy efforts — who are now pressing for systemic changes to the process of approving larger solar arrays and other renewable energy projects that would give cities and towns more of a say in determining whether those facilities get built.
“We don’t want any more of these,” East Windsor First Selectman Jason Bowsza said recently. “I want to be very clear — we don’t want any more of these.”

Who gives the go-ahead
That systemic change lawmakers are considering could begin with the Connecticut Siting Council. Established in 1971, the council regulates the placement of power plants and electric transmission lines, a process that was previously controlled largely by the use of eminent domain by utility companies.
The council’s jurisdiction has since grown to include cell phone towers, hazardous waste facilities and other types of vital infrastructure projects that often meet with heavy pushback from neighbors. For that reason, the council has the final say over siting such facilities, preempting local control.
“It was basically to end town-by-town regulation of these larger projects that impact interstate commerce,” said Melanie Bachman, who has served as the executive director of the Siting Council since 2013. 
If each town had the authority to veto projects within its borders, she added, “the lights would go off and telecommunications would go out.”
Critics, however, say the Siting Council has gone too far in weighing the interests of developers over local opposition. They point to the fact that the council has, in recent years, approved more than 80% of its applications to build large solar arrays. (By statute, the council has jurisdiction over siting any electric-generating facility over 1 megawatt, though developers of smaller projects can waive their exclusion to avoid leaving the decision up to municipal officials.)
“We look at the state and say, ‘You need to do a better job, because these are being built in residential zones, and the impact on the community and the residents that have purchased property next to them is huge,'” Dahl said.

(Mid-America All-Indian Museum)It is one of the most recognizable pieces of art in Kansas.
“The Keeper of the Plains” is Blackbear Bosin’s 44-foot steel sculpture of a Native American, hands lifted to the heavens. It is installed on a rocky plinth above the confluence of the Arkansas and Little Arkansas rivers near downtown Wichita and, since its creation in 1974, has become synonymous with the city — its aspirations and hopes and the First Peoples who came before.
It is also a Mercator of worlds.
Land and river, city and plain, earth and sky, past and present.
Red and white.
If only Bosin were still around, he might be able to tell us what it’s like to straddle two worlds. Alas, Bosin — who was born in a tipi in Oklahoma and was of Kiowa-Comanche heritage — died 45 years ago.
But the subjunctive capacity survives in his work, the ability of one soul to reveal a glimpse of itself to another in an eternal game of what if? If I had been born in another culture, or another time, or a different place, this is what my eyes might have captured, this is what my heart may have held. This is the secret of all great or at least good art: the ability to transmit experience.
I’ve been thinking about Bosin because this three-day weekend marks Indigenous Peoples’ Day. The holiday is celebrated in some localities on the second Monday in October, as an alternative to the Columbus Day federal holiday. In Kansas, despite attempts by advocates to set aside a day to respect and honor First Peoples, Indigenous People’s Day is not a paid holiday for state employees. Many cities and schools in the state do mark the day, however. It is recognized in Wichita by proclamation and was celebrated Saturday, with remembrance and a Trail of Tears walk at the Mid-America All-Indian Museum.
The museum, on the triangle of land between the Arkansas and Little Arkansas rivers, is almost in the shadow — just a short walk away — of the “Keeper of the Plains.” Established in 1969, the site was originally called a center instead of a museum, but it’s really both; not only is it a meeting place that hosts cultural events such as powwows and book talks, but it also has a collection of 3,000 American Indian artifacts.
In June, I spoke at the museum about my 2018 University Press of Kansas book, “Elevations: A Personal Exploration of the Arkansas River.” I arrived a little early for my talk and, as I walked among the exhibits, I became absorbed in the work of Bosin.
Studying his other work made me see “Keeper of the Plains” differently.
“Keeper” is his only sculpture, and I’ve seen it so often and for so long — in person, in newsprint, on postcards and regional television — that I took it for granted as a part of the Wichita landscape. Dedicated in 1974, in advance of the nation’s bicentennial, over the years it became hidden by surrounding trees. It was later placed on a raised plaza and became the centerpiece of an eight-year, $20 million river beautification and renovation project completed in 2007.
The location of the “Keeper,” where the big and little rivers meet, is of special significance to several First Nations. It’s been inhabited for centuries. The headwaters of the Arkansas River — the big river, the one most folks in Kansans call the AR-kan-sus — has its headwaters on the Continental Divide above Leadville, Colorado, more than 600 miles and about 9,000 feet of elevation away. The headwaters of the little river are 80 miles away in Rice County and not far from the ancient Native American “Serpent Effigy.”

In “Elevations,” I described rivers as liminal spaces, as those places between. While I was on the spit of land between two rivers where the Mid-American All-Indian Museum is located, I kept thinking back to the idea of the liminal as I looked at Bosin’s art. On one hand you have the quick early sketches and commercial work and on the other hand there are the cultural pieces that vibrate with color and power.
My favorite is “Prairie Fire.”
The original 1953 painting is held by the Philbrook Museum of Art in Tulsa. The dreamlike sky seethes with wind and flame, antelope jump, Native Americans race away on horseback, and wolves (or perhaps coyotes?) slink in the foreground. National Geographic used the work in its magazine and as the dust jacket cover of “Indians of the Americas.” It is the work that brought Bosin national attention and secured his place among contemporary Native American artists of the mid-20th century.
Let me pause and revise that last sentence.
It should read “contemporary American artists” instead.
Bosin was an American artist who also happened to draw inspiration from his Kiowa-Comanche culture. To qualify his work as that of a “Native American” artist is true, but also patronizing, in the same way that makes Kathryn Bigelow, the Oscar-winning director of “The Hurt Locker,” bristle at being called a woman filmmaker. Such attitudes toward Native American artists were crystallized in an April 14, 1957, review in the Tulsa World.
Bosin’s paintings “in exhibition now at Philbrook are particularly interesting as an illustration of this artist’s attempt to solve the problem which faces all Indian painters,” opined the newspaper’s arts editor, Maurice De Vinna. “That is, how to avoid repetition of stereotypical motifs without either taking his work out of the category of American Indian painting, or pushing a personal style to the point of mannerism.”
I’m not attempting to be cruel to De Vinna — somebody 70 years from now might take an example of something I’ve written as an example of our thick-headed age — but to underline the patronizing constraint under which Bosin worked. Mannerism was a part of Thomas Hart Benton’s style of exaggerated figures and vibrant color, and while Benton had plenty of critics who sneered as his populism, his heritage was not a part of the argument.
Bosin was born in 1921 in a tipi near Anadarko, Oklahoma, according to a chronology on his legacy project website. His Kiowa name was Tsate-Knogia. At a mission school he became acquainted with the work of the Kiowa Five artists and his mother, Ada, a bead worker, encouraged his interest, although he would have no formal training in art. During the Depression, the teenage Bosin peddled his own paints door-to-door for $1 or so each at Anadarko, according to a United Press International feature.
At 20, he moved to Wichita and worked at Beech Aircraft. He was a Marine during World War II, and his interest in art was rekindled while recovering from an illness in Hawaii. His first one-man show was in Honolulu in 1945.
Back in Wichita after the war, he was an industrial designer and illustrator for Boeing. In 1958, he was asked to create a mosaic for the Crystal Ballroom at the Hotel Broadview downtown. The result was “Advance of Civilization in Kansas,” and part of it depicts Coronado’s 1541 exploration of the region.
By 1959, Bosin opened the Great Plains Studio.
“Bosin attained widespread acclaim as a traditional painter,” according to the Oklahoma Historical Society. “While using some manner of the Kiowa flat style, he also employed European techniques of illusion and surrealism. This combination contributed to his work’s uniqueness. Besides relying on his own research and reading, Bosin drew inspiration from his grandmother’s tales of earlier and better times.”
In 1965, he was invited to the White House Festival of Arts and in 1970 was part of the All-Indian Show at the Kennedy Theatre in New York. It was about this time, or slightly earlier, that plans were laid for “Keeper.” The idea for the sculpture came from Elmer Hall, CEO of Kansas Gas & Electric Co. (now Evergy), according to the utility’s website. But it would be years before work began on the sculpture.

Meanwhile, Bosin pursued authenticity in his two-dimensional work.
“Bosin travels from his Wichita home to the reservations of the original Plains people to interview the few remaining medicine men and hear stories of supernatural deeds handed down over countless generations,” wrote UPI reporter Patrick Malone in 1973. “He pores over weighty anthropological finds — all in his quest to accurately chronicle what Indians looked like centuries ago, and perhaps more importantly what they dreamed.”
The five-ton “Keeper” sculpture was dedicated in 1974 as part of the nation’s bicentennial celebration. Construction was funded by $20,000 in state and municipal grants and another $8,000 in community contributions. KG&E engineers and crews created the sculpture from designs provided by Bosin. The skin for the sculpture was made from Core-Ten, a type of steel that doesn’t need painting and turns a burnished red as it weathers.
The 2007 renovations incorporated the themes of water, air, earth and fire. For 15 minutes each night, a ring of fire pots is lit near the base of sculpture. Exhibits along the limestone walls of the plaza celebrate Plains culture, including depictions of bison, ceremonial pipes and dream animals.
“This is not the place I was born,” Bosin told a Wichita Eagle reporter in 1974, “but this is the birthplace of my fathers and forefathers. (The sculpture) has conveyed everything I wanted to say. And I have a very good feeling about it. That is the reason I have asked no stipend, and why I have given the design to the city.”
As he grew older, he increasingly portrayed Plains nations as he dreamed they were in prehistory.
“Late in his life the artist remarked that his paintings never recognized the defeat of the Indian,” according to his Oklahoma Historical Society entry. “Instead, he described America as if Europeans had not arrived in 1492. His art reflected spiritual history, tribal history, and Indian myth. He depicted his people in the same way the tribal storytellers told their histories.”
Bosin died on Aug. 9, 1980, after years of heart problems. He was 59.
“Blackbear never was aware of it,” eulogized George Neavoll, an editor at the Wichita Eagle, “but I loved him with a passion that was born of the land and all that walks upon it, and none trod its surface as lovingly and as gently as the great Indian artist.”
Bosin was one of the most organic of creators. From selling his paintings door-to-door during the Depression to his most iconic work, it was inspired by time and place — and, in some cases, the dull compulsion of the economic. But art flows on, even when the most influential of artists dies, and other generations step forward. The Smithsonian has a striking digital exhibit of contemporary Native and Indigenous artists.
Nobody knows what Bosin experienced when he crossed from earth to sky, or from darkness to light, or from being to nothingness. He crossed the last great border, the threshold to Shakespeare’s “Undiscovered County.” Perhaps he joined his ancestors in a world before history. But wherever he went, he left pieces of himself scattered across our world, in paintings and murals and one singular sculpture.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-12 08:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Shapiro’s Folly — a bridge over Long Island Sound,Jim Cameron | Columnist,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/12/shapiros-folly-a-bridge-over-long-island-sound/,Connecticut has been buzzing over a local housing developer's fantastical pipe-dream of a bridge to Long Island.,"Why is much of Connecticut talking about a bridge from Bridgeport, across Long Island Sound, to New York State?  How did we get sucked into a debate about a project that every transportation expert I spoke with said just won’t happen?
You can blame (credit?) Connecticut housing developer Steven Shapiro for this distraction as he pipe-dreams way outside his area of expertise.


“A reporter from The CT Post called me to talk about housing,” he told WFSB’s “CT ‘25.”  “I always liked the idea of a bridge.  And now this thing has ballooned into a massive story.”
He even helped by generating a lovely artificial intelligence image of the structure, complete with red, white and blue towers which was gobbled up by the media.
A 14-mile bridge, costing a guesstimated $50 billion?  It’s a good thing Shapiro didn’t dangle the idea of flying cars to the reporter.
Shapiro has never built a bridge.  His expertise is in affordable housing projects in cities like Bristol, Fairfield, Milford and Easton.  That’s great, and certainly needed.  But a bridge?  Nah.
I asked the Connecticut Department of Transportation about the idea of such a bridge and they said “None of the regional MPOs (regional planning agencies) have this in their long-range plans.  It is not in CTDOT’s long-range plan for the state either.”
It’s not that our state’s planners lack vision… just money.  They must focus on the feasible, not fanciful.
Shapiro says a cross-sound bridge would get Connecticut residents to the lovely Long Island beaches faster.  But that’s hardly the justification for a $50 billion bridge.  And anyhow, what’s wrong with Connecticut’s beaches?
As for the $50 billion estimated price, Shapiro says the new Tappan Zee Bridge replacement, the Mario Cuomo Bridge, cost $4 billion for its three-mile length. “If you prorate that out to 15 miles, it’s $20 billion,” he says.  Factor in inflation and adding a train line on the bridge and you’re at $30 billion.  Rounding upward, because things always cost more than planned, and he suggests a $50 billion price tag is reasonable.
But is that a fair calculation?  Is that how Shapiro bids on housing development jobs?
And what would it cost to drive across this hypothetical bridge?  Shapiro suggests a one-way toll of about $40.
Compare that to the one-way fare of about $75 for a car and driver on the Bridgeport – Port Jefferson ferry.  That makes Shapiro’s bridge look like a bargain… except only those who take the ferry pay the fare.  Build a bridge and all of us taxpayers pay for it, even if we never go to the Hamptons.
And if there were a bridge, wouldn’t that just worsen traffic in Connecticut with more New Yorkers going to New England?
The idea of bridging Long Island Sound has been studied by experts as recently as 2017.  They concluded that there were serious environmental issues and maybe ten or more state and federal agencies would need to be involved.  Most concerning, the report said that tolls would cover only 22% of the debt service (with guess-who paying the difference) and that it would take five years to plan and eight years to build.
Meantime, our state’s housing crisis is happening right now.  Maybe Shapiro could focus on his real skill set and not dangle unfeasible, bright shiny objects in front of a click-hungry media.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Bridge-AI-Picture-by-Shapiro-1024x595.png,,,2025-10-12 04:56:49.322137

When they do, leadership’s iron grip will crack, not because those in power wanted to change, but because voters finally forced them to.","FIVE AND A HALF hours into a tedious rules debate at the Massachusetts State House in January 2019, acting Speaker Tom Petrolati ordered a roll call vote on a noncontroversial amendment, and voted no. Within seconds, red lights, representing “no” votes, lit up the electronic vote-tally board in the House chamber as dozens of rank-and-file members followed his lead.  
Then, realizing he had made a mistake (but not realizing his mic was still on), Petrolati stammered: “It’s a yes?… Switch ’em. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Yes. Yes!”  
After his vote on the large display board flipped to green for “yes,” so, too, did the votes of at least 63 Democratic representatives. (The video of this moment remains on the Legislature’s website, beginning at 5:35:49.)  
Beacon Hill Roll Call reporter Bob Katzen’s write-up of the all-too-common event didn’t mince words: “Did these 63 even know what they were voting on? Did they care? What would cause them to switch their votes other than they decided to follow the ‘suggestion’ of the speaker?”  
In a separate interview, Rep. Russell Holmes, one of the few at that time to openly criticize the system, offered a blunt assessment: “The entire legislative establishment is a scam. [The Speaker] is like a shepherd leading the sheep. Most reps vote the way he tells them to vote.” 
Having grown up in deep-blue Massachusetts, I viewed politics through a national lens. Beyond knowing my rep’s names, I never thought much about what goes on under the Golden Dome on the corner of Boston Common.  
Like many, I assumed that Massachusetts was liberal, and therefore, so was our State House. If a progressive policy was doable, the same electorate that chose Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey would have chosen a Legislature excited to make it happen.  
That assumption crumbled when I started working on a documentary about why daylight saving time (DST) reform won’t pass the Legislature, despite broad public support. 
What began as an attempt to use the Legislature’s clunky website to trace the path of a DST bill quickly turned into a ten-month (and counting) investigation. Interviews with lawmakers, activists, and reporters all confirmed the same truth of how laws actually pass in Massachusetts: Just a few members of leadership decide which bills live or die. Debate is staged, and the real lawmaking happens behind closed doors.  
Massachusetts has one of the least transparent, least productive legislatures in the country. Despite our state’s progressive reputation — and a Democratic supermajority in both chambers — our State House won’t pass basic party priorities. This includes bills to:  

Prevent offshore corporate tax dodging 


Implement LGBTQ+ inclusive sex-ed 


Provide menstrual products in schools, prison, and shelters 


Stop wage theft  


Enact same-day voter registration 


End state/local collaboration with ICE 


Ban cash bail and mandatory minimum sentences 

The “Act to Stop Wage Theft” referenced above? It had a supermajority of co-sponsors in the House a few years ago, yet it never received a vote. Here’s why.  
Each law must go through several committees led by handpicked allies of the leadership; committee votes were completely opaque until mounting public pressure spurred changes this summer.  
These committees serve as bottlenecks, allowing leadership to effectively choose what bills get a vote by the full chamber. When committee chairs go against the Speaker or Senate president, they risk losing this position and the extra salary that comes with it. Representatives have even lost pay and power just for being critical of leadership.  
Former rep. Denise Provost has pointed out that leadership used to poll members before major bills. But after a threshold of lawmakers with leadership-controlled stipends was reached, the polling stopped.  
This top-down dynamic should frustrate Republicans as well: Minority Leader Brad Jones cooperates with the Speaker to block some roll-call votes Democrats prefer not to be recorded on.   
No House committee is more important than the Ways and Means Committee. Internal rules require that many bills go through that committee, before the full House can vote on them, making Speaker Mariano’s handpicked chair, Rep. Aaron Michlewitz, one of the most powerful people in the Bay State. 
For big money industries, like private insurance, this structure is a gift. Instead of persuading 160 representatives to kill or pass a bill, they only need to win over a small handful of gatekeepers. And if you wonder what their preferred method of persuasion might be, just look at Michlewitz’s campaign reports: Since 2009, he’s run unopposed, yet between 2020 and 2024 he raised $1,995,765.21.  
Beacon Hill’s contempt for the public will is perfectly illustrated by a largely forgotten incident from two decades ago, whose key players now run the Legislature. 
In 2003, Massachusetts residents petitioned to put a constitutional right to affordable health care on the ballot. “Romneycare,” the bipartisan Massachusetts law that served as a blueprint for the Affordable Care Act, was still being shaped, and activists feared lawmakers would gut patient protections to appease the powerful insurance lobby.  
After collecting over 71,000 signatures to begin the process for amending the Massachusetts Constitution, the hard part was finished. All that remained was getting 25 percent of the Legislature to approve it in two sessions. When the first vote confirmed it, 153-41, the second seemed like a formality. However, the vote would never happen.  
When the next session convened, House and Senate leadership backed an effort to send the question to study, a procedural trick to kill a measure without taking a public stance. Lawmakers fell in line, 118-76, and voters never got to decide if affordable health care should become a right.  
Then-committee chairs Ron Mariano and Karen Spilka were among the few legislators to openly argue for the motion on the floor, a gamble that should have made them the face of killing affordable health care. Ultimately, their gamble paid off: Today, House Speaker Mariano and Senate President Spilka each sit atop massive campaign accounts fueled by lots of money from the health care and insurance industry.  
Today, the “study” maneuver is a convenient tactic to quietly kill bills, as citizens are misled into thinking their bill is being actively considered; lobbyists know better.  
When activists challenged the scuttled ballot question at the state’s highest court, justices agreed that lawmakers violated their constitutional duty by failing to hold a second vote on the proposal, but the court said it had no authority to compel action by lawmakers under the separation of powers. The only recourse, the justices said, was at the ballot box.  
It’s taken nearly 20 years, but recent events suggest that political recourse may finally be within reach, and that frustration with Beacon Hill’s establishment is near a breaking point.  
First came last fall’s closely watched contest in Cambridge, when Democratic union leader Evan MacKay took on Rep. Marjorie Decker, a fixture in local politics, making legislative reform the cornerstone of their primary challenge. MacKay attacked Decker for repeatedly taking votes that strengthened leadership’s power over rank-and-file members, undermining the progressive values she claimed to support.  
To say Decker was favored would be an understatement: Her campaign had a four-to-one spending advantage, bolstered by a rooftop fundraiser that drew a who’s who of party insiders, including Gov. Maura Healey. Despite all that, MacKay came within 41 votes of an upset, marking the first time Decker dropped below 83 percent support as an incumbent. 
Then, in June, after mounting criticism for their slowest start in 40 years (six laws passed in six months), legislative leadership caved to rule reforms they had stonewalled for years. Public committee votes, publicly available testimony, and plain-language bill summaries may sound like basic democratic norms, but on Beacon Hill, they were fought tooth and nail. Their sudden passage was such a shock that one activist excitedly texted me: “It looks like we won on nearly everything.” 
Perhaps most telling of all, 72 percent of voters supported a ballot question last November authorizing the state auditor to audit the Legislature, an unmistakable mandate that Beacon Hill can’t police itself. Like clockwork, the Legislature brazenly ignored the result, arguing it was an unconstitutional violation of the separation of powers.  
Let’s be clear: this argument is cover for preserving unchecked power. The auditor is an independent, voter-elected watchdog; she’s neither appointed by nor answerable to the governor. She is “executive” only in a technical, structural sense, not in any chain of command way that would trigger separation of powers concerns.  
If you’re an aspiring activist who feels waving around a “No Kings” sign falls short of impactful activism, look at state government as an avenue for change. Lobbying your state rep will do far more than mailing a postcard to Wisconsin for a judicial election. Medicare for all is likely to happen here long before Congress secures a filibuster-proof majority.  
If your rep is one of the 85 percent of House Democrats who voted with the Speaker 100 percent of the time in 2024 (full list here), ask them directly: Are they proud that their paycheck and ability to represent the district depends on their loyalty to the House speaker? Are they open to supporting new leadership and new rules that put constituents first?  
And if they shrug you off, connect with local advocacy groups and find a candidate worth backing, or consider becoming that candidate yourself. Only under the threat of losing their seats will rank-and-file members reclaim their power to oust authoritative leaders and rewrite the rules to favor voters.  
For decades, Beacon Hill has shamelessly ignored voters, because the public has never held them accountable. Mariano and Spilka weren’t shamed for helping kill affordable health care, they were rewarded. But sooner or later, enough people will learn how democracy in Massachusetts is a lie. When they do, leadership’s iron grip will crack, not because those in power wanted to change, but because voters finally forced them to.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Amid the ongoing federal government shutdown and a recent high-profile immigration arrest in Iowa, Republicans gathered Saturday to deliver a warm sendoff for U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst at her 10th annual Roast and Ride fundraiser Saturday.
Though the motorcycle ride from Big Barn Harley-Davidson to the Iowa State Fairgrounds and following pig roast is a fundraising event, Ernst herself is not running for reelection. She announced in early September she would not seek a third term in the U.S. Senate. Speaking to a crowd of 600 gathered at the Elwell Family Food Center, Ernst thanked Iowans for supporting her throughout her time in public service.
“It is my last Roast and Ride, our 10th year of doing this, and it was just a privilege to be able to wrap up in such a great way today,” Ernst told reporters.
Gov. Kim Reynolds said the final Roast and Ride was “a little bittersweet.” Reynolds, who also announced she will not run for reelection in 2026, said she and Ernst’s political careers were linked, having served in county government and in the Iowa Senate.
“Who would have guessed back then, in those local government days, that one of us would become (Iowa’s first) female United States senator in 2014, and the other would become Iowa’s first female governor in 2018,” Reynolds said.  “Not too bad for a pair of rural Iowans.”
U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley said he was “not here to roast Joni, I’m here to thank Joni for her public service and more importantly, saving me from 30 years of having a Democratic colleague” in the Senate. He asked the crowd to help him continue working with a fellow Republican by voting in the 2026 U.S. Senate election.
Shortly after Ernst’s exit from the race, U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson announced she would run for the position, and quickly became the frontrunner for the GOP nomination. Hinson has received endorsements from President Donald Trump and Senate Republican leadership.
Hinson said if elected, she would work to continue Ernst’s legacy in the Senate on issues like immigration, government efficiency and supporting veterans.
“We know that in the Senate, Joni has helped pave the way for what it means to put Iowa first and put America first,” Hinson said. “These values are values that we share, and we are continuing to work together for you. … We’re going to continue to deport those criminal illegal aliens who threaten our communities. We’re going to stop China from owning our food supply. We’re going to protect veterans, continue to work on cutting taxes and protecting taxpayers and help Iowa’s working families to thrive.”
Ernst has not officially endorsed Hinson to succeed her in the Senate but told reporters, “I will tell you that she has my full support and you may hear something more official a little bit later on.”
Video remarks from Ernst’s GOP Senate colleagues including Sens. Ted Cruz, Tim Scott, Markwayne Mullin, Katie Britt, Marsha Blackburn, Rick Scott, Dave McCormick, Ted Budd, and Pete Ricketts thanking the Iowa Republican for her work in the Senate and voicing support for the Roast and Ride, were shown at the event.
There was one high-profile Republican from outside Iowa in attendance at the event: U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which oversees U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, has collaborated with Sen. Chuck Grassley and other Iowans making requests regarding the ICE arrest and detainment of former Des Moines Public Schools Superintendent Ian Roberts in late September.
DHS confirmed Roberts, who is a citizen of Guyana, had been given an order of removal by an immigration judge in May 2024, in addition to sharing information about his previous criminal history. Reports have also found Roberts had falsified portions of his educational background and achievements.
U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra, who has launched an exploratory committee to run for governor in 2026, said Iowans “owe” Noem for her support in apprehending Roberts. He also linked the incident to Democratic control in the Des Moines school system.
“That is what happens when you have a liberal, progressive agenda,” Feenstra said. “In the Des Moines public school system, that school board allowed it to happen. We can never allow that to happen again.”
Noem said Trump had told her “make sure that you tell them about the individuals in Iowa that we got rid of, that have been so terrible, that have been illegal aliens that have devastated families” when she was speaking at the event. She shared cases of arresting undocumented individuals with criminal backgrounds in Iowa communities like Council Bluffs and Cherokee County.
She also talked about Roberts, celebrating his arrest and criticizing the fact that “no one did a background check on him.” Des Moines school board officials said Roberts had completed the I-9 employment eligibility verification form and submitted other required documentation to show his eligibility to work in the U.S. when he was hired, and are suing JG Consulting for not providing information on Roberts’ criminal history and immigration status when he was suggested during the superintendent search process.
Noem said Roberts was “interacting with children every single day, making a six-figure salary with benefits as well, that so many people in the United States could have been benefiting from.”
“Now he’s away from your children, and he’s being brought to justice,” Noem said.
The fundraiser comes on the 11th day of the federal government shutdown. On Friday, the Trump administration began a process of mass layoffs of federal employees, a step not taken during previous government shutdowns. The shutdown is expected to continue into the coming week, as the Senate is not scheduled to return until Tuesday.
Iowa Democrats criticized Iowa’s all-Republican federal delegation for attending fundraisers like Ernst’s event while the federal government remains shuttered. Iowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart said in a statement Friday Reps. Hinson, Mariannette Miller-Meeks, Zach Nunn and Feenstra “are treating this shutdown like a vacation.”
“Why can’t Iowa’s representatives show some Iowa work ethic instead of spending the weekend at Joni Ernst’s Republican fundraiser?” Hart said. “They should be working with their Republican colleagues to find a deal to open the government and prevent a spike in Iowans’ healthcare premiums. Don’t they think Iowans are paying attention?”
Nunn was not in attendance Saturday, though a video was shown at the event of him thanking Ernst for her service.
The shutdown has largely come in part as Democrats seek to extend health care premium tax credits for the Affordable Care Act. Democrats have said not passing this extension will cost health insurance costs to spike across the country and blame the shutdown on Republicans for not agreeing to negotiate. But Trump and Republican leaders have framed the shutdown as the result of Democrats wanting to provide undocumented immigrants with government-supported health care – a claim repeated at the fundraiser.
Ernst said Republicans care about allowing people to continue having health coverage, but said there is rampant waste and fraud that needs to be addressed in the ACA system. She said the ACA is not affordable, and that GOP leaders are open to having a discussion on a “different model” for health care coverage after the shutdown ends.
“I’ve talked to a number of my Democratic colleagues about what do we do next, and how can we come to an agreement to open the government and then come up with a plan to move forward,” Ernst said. “And I know the president has been really open to that as well. So, I am hopeful we get the government open, we actually have serious talks on fraud and waste within the program, and then we actually make a difference and make healthcare affordable for those folks that truly do need that support.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Ernst.Ride_.10.11.4-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-11 18:57:20.290680

(Delilah Brumer/Colorado Newsline)Republicans in El Paso County on Saturday once again selected Second Amendment activist Ava Flanell to fill a vacant seat in the Colorado House of Representatives, after the first vacancy committee vote was invalidated by the secretary of state’s office.
Flanell won during the second round of voting with 34 votes. Joe Woyte received 30 votes. Troy Vanderhule also ran and was eliminated when he came in third place during the first round of votes.
“This position is not about me. It’s about you, about this district. It’s ensuring our community is represented with strong principles and a patriotic voice at the Capitol,” Flanell said ahead of the first vote.
Flanell will join the 22-member House Republican Caucus.
“Like many of you, I look around and see a Colorado that doesn’t resemble the one we grew up loving. This is about protecting what makes America strong and restoring what made America exceptional: faith, family and freedom and personal responsibility,” she said.
This was the second time a vacancy committee met to appoint someone to the seat. They first met on Sept. 22 and selected Flanell, but the results were not valid because the meeting did not meet the 10-day written notice requirement.
Flanell will replace former Rep. Rose Pugliese, a Republican who resigned in September after a public fallout with House majority leadership during a special session in August.
She will serve the remainder of Pugliese’s term and will need to run for reelection next year if she wants to stay in the seat.
The Legislature is set to reconvene in January.

Four were killed in downtown Leland after a high school football homecoming game in the Mississippi Delta on the state’s western edge, a state senator said Saturday.
About 20 people were injured in the gunfire after a gathering in downtown Leland following the game, state Sen. Derrick Simmons said. Of the 20 wounded, four were in critical condition and flown from a hospital in nearby Greenville to a larger medical center in the state capital of Jackson, Simmons told The Associated Press.
Simmons said he was being updated on developments by the Washington County Sheriff’s Department and other law enforcement authorities in the Delta.
“People were just congregating and having a good time in the downtown of Leland,” Simmons said of the town with a population of fewer than 4,000 people.
He was told that after the gunfire, the scene was “very chaotic,” as police, sheriff’s deputies and ambulances “responded from all over.”
“It’s just senseless gun violence,” he said. “What we are experiencing now is just a proliferation of guns just being in circulation.”
No arrests were immediately announced, and Simmons said late Saturday morning that he had not heard any information about possible suspects.
“They are on the ground working and I have all the faith in the world that they will get to the bottom of this,” he said.
“As the state senator for the area, we are asking any and all individuals who might have any information regarding the horrific shooting last night to come forward and provide whatever information they have,” he added.
Meanwhile, police in the small Mississippi town of Heidelberg in the eastern part of the state are investigating a shooting during that community’s homecoming weekend that left two people dead.
Both of them were killed on the school campus Friday night, Heidelberg Police Chief Cornell White said. He declined to say whether the victims were students or provide other information about the crimes.
“Right now we’ve still got a subject at large, but I can’t give specifics,” White said Saturday morning.
An 18-year-old man was being sought for questioning in the Heidelberg shooting, the Jasper County Sheriff’s Department football game Friday night. The town of about 640 residents is about 85 miles southeast of Jackson.
It wasn’t clear exactly when the gunfire occurred or how close it was to the stadium. White said he was at the scene Saturday investigating, and that more information might be released in coming days.

Mississippi is among them.
The dates, in late October and November, could be extended, and it is not immediately clear when the other three states will remove their troops. But the planned withdrawals signal that the surge of troops into the nation’s capital may head toward a drawdown or a change in scope.
The plans by the contributing states come as Trump takes his push to send the military to other American cities, including Chicago and Portland, Oregon, which have each pushed back with legal action to try to stop any deployment.
The National Guard was activated in D.C. in August after Trump issued an executive order proclaiming an emergency over what the Republican president said were crime concerns. The order placed the local police department under the president’s authority for 30 days and then lapsed when Congress did not renew it.
But roughly 2,300 Guard members from eight states, as well as D.C., and hundreds of federal law enforcement officers remained in the city. According to official figures, more than 4,000 people have been arrested as part of the campaign since August.
Authorities in Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina, Ohio and West Virginia all told The Associated Press they had a planned end date for their deployments. The other states with troops in D.C. — Alabama, Louisiana and South Dakota — did not respond to requests seeking information.
South Carolina, which initially sent 200 troops and now has about 40, said it plans to withdraw by the end of October, according to Maj. Karla Evans, South Carolina Guard spokesperson.
Ohio, Georgia, Mississippi and West Virginia said they planned to remove their troops by Nov. 30.
The five states together make up more than 80% of the 1,300 out-of-state troops deployed to D.C. The D.C. National Guard deployment is made up of around 1,000 forces and has had its orders extended at least through December.
Asked about the planned withdrawals, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said Trump’s law enforcement campaign in the capital had led to a reduction in crime. “These are undeniable positive results that everyone can celebrate.”
Trump has heralded his crime-fighting campaign in the nation’s capital as a resounding success. And data shows crime has decreased during that time, although rates were already falling before. But the lingering presence of the National Guard in Washington, D.C., has raised questions about Trump’s endgame for the deployments.
The Guard troops have patrolled transit hubs and tourist sites and as the deployment has dragged on, have become a fixture of the city’s urban scenery at parks and in neighborhoods. Their presence, at times armed, has been enough to unnerve residents, although no violent incidents have been reported. They also have picked up trash and in the case of the D.C. Guard, run an initiative that has done everything from help package meals for.
The news of a planned drawdown could be a relief for some residents, who have seen the unprecedented military deployment as increasingly normalized.
“This is not normal,” said Joseph Johnson, a local elected official who chairs a neighborhood advisory commission. “We know this should never have happened in the first place.”
A lawsuit brought by D.C.’s attorney general is challenging the deployment, with a hearing scheduled for Oct. 24.
D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser’s office declined to comment. Bowser has said on several occasions that National Guard deployed from other states “has not been an efficient use of those resources.”
Some, however, said since the deployment was unavoidable, they tried to take advantage of it, especially with the D.C. Guard members running an initiative that has included cleaning neighborhoods and removing graffiti, as well as working with local food banks to package food and helping to revitalize a recreation center.
“They have no guns. They have no rifles, and they are truly doing what we have asked them to do to come and be a part of our community clean up,” Johnson said.
His fellow neighborhood advisory commissioner, Marcus Hickman, welcomed the additional help when the D.C. Guard emailed commissioners and asked if there were any needs. It allowed community members to work side by side with the guard members. Other plans are in the works, including the D.C. Guard joining in a school reading program, he said.
“When someone offers to come and help you clean your house, there is something to be said. A cleaner community is often a safer community.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10132923/AP25282690330683.jpg,,,2025-10-11 14:02:11.717941

$17.5M OneWorld building marks milestone in $235M South and North Omaha state grant program 

When completed, the new three-story health care workforce training center will be the fourth structure at the historic Livestock Exchange stockyards campus in South Omaha, which OneWorld calls home.
The 29,000-square-foot facility is funded in part with $9.5 million from the $235 million North and South Omaha Recovery Grant Program administered by the Nebraska Department of Economic Development. In addition to worker development programs, it will house a child development center and micro-unit for epidemic or pandemic responses.
“This new space will allow us to expand behavioral health services and invest in workforce development, ensuring that healing and growth are further built into the framework of our community,” said Andrea Skolkin, OneWorld CEO.
Work on the facility will continue through next year, and services are expected to launch in early 2027.
Thursday’s event, which drew numerous community supporters and city and state officials to the site, is known as a topping out ceremony in the construction world. As per tradition, people sign their name or leave a personal message on the building’s last and highest structural beam before it is lifted into place. The occasion celebrates completion of framing and symbolizes collective achievement and connects supporters to the cause.

Established in 1970, OneWorld is a federally qualified health center that provides quality and affordable primary, mental, substance abuse and dental care for more than 50,000 patients each year at 20 clinical locations in Omaha, Bellevue and Plattsmouth. The network serves families and individuals without regard to insurance status or ability to pay. 
Canopy South, a nonprofit based in South Omaha, played a critical role in securing and managing the public grant for the project, called the OneWorld Health Care Workforce Development Center.
“By bringing critical health services and workforce opportunities into the heart of South Omaha, we’re not only honoring the history of this campus, we’re shaping a future where every resident has a chance to thrive,” said César García, Canopy South’s executive director.

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden has pledged to pay $217 of his own money to keep Mount Rushmore lit for the next week.
Rhoden’s Saturday morning announcement came in tandem with pledges from West River lawmakers to personally pay the national memorial’s nightly lighting ceremony bills. Rhoden pledged to cover seven nights. Various lawmakers and one private citizen have made pledges to pay the daily bill after Rhoden if the shutdown continues.
The nightly light bill is $30.94, Rhoden spokeswoman Josie Harms told South Dakota Searchlight.
‘Substantial’ layoffs of federal workers launched by Trump administration amid shutdown

The memorial has remained open during the shutdown, but South Dakota’s Travel SD website notes that the lighting ceremony is “temporarily unavailable.” The visitor center is also closed and ranger talks are temporarily unavailable.
The promise to pay Rushmore’s light bills is the latest in a series of statements from the Republican governor aimed at pressuring Congressional Democrats to fold and pass the funding bill supported by the body’s GOP majority.
Since the shutdown began on Oct. 1, Democrats have pushed their Republican counterparts to negotiate on extensions for expiring health care subsidies before supporting a funding bill. Rhoden is among the Republican governors that signed on to a letter Thursday urging Democrats to give in and pass a funding bill. 
On Sept. 30, Rhoden signed a statement from a group called the Governors Council of the America First Policy Institute urging both sides to find a way to avoid the shutdown that came hours later. 
This week on social media, Rhoden used the term “Schumer Shutdown,” a reference to the Senate’s Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, of New York. Daily news releases from Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune, of South Dakota, use the term in their subject lines.
Rhoden’s news release on the lights at Mount Rushmore says the payments were facilitated by the nonprofit Mount Rushmore Society through its partnership with the National Park Service.
It also says Rhoden “has received many other pledges to support shining the lights if the shutdown continues longer.”

(Photo illustration by Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)After multiple Republican candidates for governor advocated firing university professors recently for personal social media posts, one of those professors says South Dakota politics is sliding down a “dangerous path.”
“They’re trying to limit what universities can offer, what faculty members can teach, what we can say in the classroom, and now, apparently, outside of it,” said Timothy Schorn, an associate professor of political science and director of the University of South Dakota’s international studies program.
After the Sept. 10 fatal shooting of political activist and commentator Charlie Kirk, some Republican officials nationwide encouraged Americans to report people who criticized Kirk. Schorn is one of the people who has received scrutiny.
South Dakota university drops effort to fire professor for Charlie Kirk post

On the evening of Sept. 12, Schorn published a more than 700-word criticism of Kirk to a personal Facebook account. The post included criticism of Kirk’s views on race, guns, religion and more.
On Sept. 30, Republican gubernatorial candidate Toby Doeden, of Aberdeen, published a social media post calling attention to Schorn’s writings and accusing him of  “indoctrination and radicalization of our young people.”
“Under my leadership,” Doeden wrote, people like Schorn “will have no place in the classroom!”
In a statement to South Dakota Searchlight, Doeden said taxpayers should not fund Schorn’s views.
“This is about taxpayers’ money, plain and simple,” Doeden said. “If Mr. Schorn wants to open a business with his own money and speak this way, that is his right as an American.”
U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, another Republican running for governor, has not called for firings in reaction to comments about Kirk. He told South Dakota Searchlight that he has disagreed with many of Schorn’s comments.
“It’s important to remember, though, that stupid comments from professors are generally protected by the First Amendment when issued as private citizens, rather than state employees,” Johnson said.
Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden has not yet said whether he’ll be a candidate to keep his job next year. He declined to comment about Schorn, but a spokesperson said Rhoden “takes open and civil discourse on our college campuses very seriously.”
Rhoden was previously involved in another controversy about statements by a university professor.
In a post to a personal social media account within hours of Kirk’s death, University of South Dakota art professor Michael Hook used profanity and derogatory terms to describe Kirk while questioning the veracity of Kirk supporters’ concerns about political violence.
Two days later, candidate for governor and state Speaker of the House Jon Hansen, R-Dell Rapids, posted to social media about Hook.
“I immediately reached out to USD President Sheila Gestring and called on the professor to be fired,” Hansen wrote.

Two hours after Hansen posted that, Rhoden posted to social media that “the Board of Regents intends to FIRE this University of South Dakota professor, and I’m glad.”
“We must not send the message to our kids that this is acceptable public discourse. We need more Charlie Kirks on campus and less hatred like this,” Rhoden wrote.
The state Board of Regents and the university placed Hook on administrative leave with an intent to fire him. He sued, and a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order on Sept. 24, requiring the university to reinstate him pending further proceedings in the case.
The judge found that Hook had spoken as a citizen on a matter of public concern, which is a form of constitutionally protected speech; that the state failed to produce evidence that his speech had an adverse impact on the efficiency of university operations; and that Hook had a fair chance of prevailing in his lawsuit by showing the actions taken against him were a form of retaliation that could chill protected speech.
On Oct. 3, Hook’s attorney released a letter from USD President Sheila Gestring informing Hook he would no longer be fired.
“We have taken into consideration your remorse for the post, your past record of service, and the university’s interest in efficient operations,” the letter said.
Hook issued a statement that said in part, “I hope the state now understands that the First Amendment prohibits it from punishing anyone for speech about public issues — no matter how much state or national leaders or others disagree with it.”
Schorn, who studies authoritarian governments and human rights, said he views the threats of termination as part of a broader, national effort to chill speech and control thought.
“If universities can’t tolerate uncomfortable ideas, then we’re no longer educating, we’re indoctrinating,” Schorn said. “And that’s exactly what these politicians claim to oppose.”

Photo by TimothyJ via FlickrA proposed south Georgia chicken plant that could be the state’s largest poultry operation is on hold after a Coffee County judge found it would likely harm locals’ health and property values and damage the nearby Satilla River.
The proposal called for 60 chicken houses, each holding more than 25,000 birds, which are projected to produce at least 40,000 pounds of litter roughly every eight weeks – about how long they will be on site – and up to 450,000 carcasses on the site per year. 
“According to Defendants, this waste, including dead carcasses, will be periodically hauled off site but will sit in the houses for months before being sold,” wrote Coffee County Superior Court Judge J. Kelly Brooks in his order halting the project while a legal trial continues. “Defendants could not name the hauler or describe the method or frequency of disposal in any manner. Nor could they identify any odor or dust suppression methods to be employed.”
The plaintiffs, a group of landowners near the proposed site, had a variety of reasons for not wanting the operation to start up, mostly having to do with not wanting to be exposed to chicken feces, rotting bird corpses and bacterial runoff.
One local farm owner testified that she and one of her grandchildren are severe asthmatics and she worries about the effects of breathing in particulates from the plant.
Former GOP state Rep. Chuck Sims, representing his company, Sims Funeral Home, testified that he “does not want attendees to be bombarded with pathogen-laden dust and the smell of chicken feces and corpses as they are mourning.”
Other testimony indicated that the project could harm the Satilla River for miles, and potentially all the way to the Atlantic Ocean, and that property owners could see the value of their land drop by up to 30%. 
Brooks also criticized defendants for not making any attempts to contact neighbors or engage with the community about the project.
“The evidence clearly showed that Defendants pursued this project quietly and avoided community engagement until forced to respond through these proceedings,” Brooks wrote.
“The court is not without empathy for potential financial injury to Defendants,” he added. “However, such injury is largely self-inflicted.”
George Lott, an attorney with Atlanta-based Evans Bowers representing the plaintiffs, said a grassroots effort helped bring the project to light.
“Our clients had no idea that this was going forward until the project was already several weeks or several months in the works,” he said. “And it’s almost hard to describe all the efforts they’ve made to try to get information. They held town hall meetings, they contacted county commissioners, they contacted other government regulators, entities, to try to figure out what’s being proposed, who was proposing it, what work was going to be done, and then they even tried to contact some of the defendants directly and couldn’t make any progress. And so they really didn’t know the full scope until right before we filed the lawsuit, I think.”
Kasey Sturm, an attorney with the law firm Weissman representing the defendants, said that’s not accurate.
“I don’t think that’s a fair characterization,” she said. “The property is zoned agricultural. It has widely been acknowledged that chicken farming is an acceptable practice in agricultural land. And again, these family farmers obtained the requisite authority both from the state and from the county to construct and operate chicken houses on their respective farms.”
Sturm also rejected the characterization of the project as the largest poultry operation in the state.
“This is five separate farms, each with 12 houses, which is common and consistent with poultry across the state, consistent with what you see in Coffee County,” she said. “Coffee County is number 15 as far as counties in the state of Georgia for poultry production; this is a very common occurrence in Coffee County.”
Brooks’ order puts the project on hold until the court holds a final trial. Lott said it’s still too early to guess how long that could take.
“Every court is different. Sometimes it’s a matter of months. Sometimes it takes years to get to the final trial. So it’s hard to predict the timing of all of this, but in the interim, until the court holds a final hearing, there is an injunction that prevents further construction on site.”
Sturm said the farmers are evaluating their options and are concerned the ruling could discourage poultry businesses from coming to Georgia.
“We’re disappointed with the ruling,” she said. “We believe it’s contrary to the evidence that was presented at the hearing. The ruling has somewhat of a chilling effect on the marketability of title in the state of Georgia, such that farmers now need to look at when they go and sell property, are they going to be hauled into court for the potential future use of that property by somebody they sell it to? That’s a concern.”

Jill Nolin/Georgia RecorderVoting rights advocates in Meriwether County have filed a lawsuit challenging the districts drawn for local county commission seats, which they say illegally dilute the voting power of Black residents under the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
The lawsuit, which was filed in federal court Thursday, alleges that district maps enacted in 2022 have contributed to the lack of Black representation on the board of commissioners, despite the fact that Black voters make up “a substantial percentage” of the county’s population. The Georgia NAACP, which according to the lawsuit has roughly 100 members who reside in the county, is one of the plaintiffs.
“We will not stand by and watch Black voters in Georgia be stripped of their right to fair representation,” Georgia NAACP President Gerald Griggs said in a statement, calling the maps “a direct attack on this community’s political power.”
Meriwether County is located about 50 miles south of Atlanta. Its five-member board of commissioners, which is tasked with adopting county policies, establishing a budget and maintaining roads, bridges and other infrastructure, is currently all white.
Hani Mirza, who serves as director of the power and democracy program at Advancement Project, a civil rights organization involved with the case, said the new maps have “had an immediate impact on Black representation at the county level in Meriwether County.” 
The new maps, the lawsuit says, were adopted over the objections of the county’s then-only Black commissioner, who is no longer in office. 
In one district, Black representation has hovered around 50% before and after redistricting, but in another, the Black voting age population decreased from about 45% to less than 30%. None of the three Black candidates who have run for a county commission since the new maps took effect have been successful, according to the lawsuit. 
One remedy proposed in the complaint would redraw the maps to create two new Black-majority districts for the county commission. One district would span the north and central parts of the county, including towns like Greenville, Woodbury and Lone Oak, while the other would include southern Meriwether County areas like Manchester and Warm Springs.
Rev. James Clements, a Black Meriwether County resident and one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, said that the board of commissioners once included two Black members, and described the hopelessness members of the Black community feel as a result of the loss of representation on the commission.
Now some Black residents he’s talked to, Clements said in an interview with the Recorder, “don’t feel the need to even go to a commissioner meeting, because they don’t feel that their voice is going to be heard.”
Clements ran as a Democrat for a seat on the commission last year, losing to the Republican candidate by only 12 votes. But he says his involvement in the lawsuit “has nothing to do with” his own candidacy.
If a white candidate wins in a majority-minority district, “that’s because they’re the better candidate,” he said. “But we’d just like the opportunity to be able to be represented at the board of commissioners’ office.”
Meriwether Board of Elections and Election Supervisor Patty Threadgill did not respond to requests for comment.
However, the voting rights law that the lawsuit hinges on may itself be on shaky ground. Next week, the U.S. Supreme Court is scheduled to rehear arguments in Louisiana v. Callais, a case filed by white voters in Louisiana challenging the 2024 congressional district maps that included two Black-majority districts. Voting rights advocates say the Supreme Court’s ruling has the potential to overturn a key provision of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits racial gerrymandering that dilutes minority voting power.
Mirza with the Advancement Project said he is monitoring the Supreme Court case.
“We’re, like others, watching to see what happens and will respond accordingly,” Mirza said.

Reporting Highlights

Serious Charge: Drivers are rarely charged with murder in fatal car crashes unless they have aggravating factors — such as past DUIs or excessive speed.
Uncommon Plea Deal: Unlike most people facing these charges in Alabama’s 19th Circuit Court, this defendant was not offered a plea deal for a lesser charge.
Unusual Suspect: Years after the crash, attorneys involved in the case would attempt to shed light on why it went so differently than similar cases — and what they believe was bias.

These highlights were written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

When 19-year-old Jorge Ruiz walked into the Autauga County Jail in handcuffs on Oct. 28, 2018, he wasn’t a typical suspect. He was out of place and in big trouble in a deeply conservative part of Alabama.
That morning, he’d been driving about 70 miles per hour in a 55 zone when he crossed the center line of a two-lane rural highway. His Ford pickup collided head-on with a Honda Civic, killing the woman behind the wheel. Paramedics took Ruiz to the hospital, where a blood test found a trace amount of alcohol. At just 0.016, it was below the legal threshold for intoxication.
But rather than charging him with manslaughter, which typically would be the most extreme charge brought under the circumstances, police went further. They arrested him for murder.

To support such a murder charge, prosecutors are supposed to show that a defendant’s conduct displays “extreme indifference” — behavior so reckless that someone is likely to die, as when a person fires a gun into a crowd or steers a boat into a group of swimmers. Suspects charged with murder after car crashes often are documented to have blood alcohol levels more than twice the legal limit and 10 times the level found in Ruiz’s blood, according to a review of Alabama cases from the last 20 years by ProPublica. Many others had prior DUIs or were driving 100 miles per hour or more. In this case, the suspect had a clean criminal history and wasn’t even going fast enough to be ticketed for aggravated speeding.
Ruiz’s trial attorney said that as soon as he started talking to the district attorney’s office, the case felt different. Across the three counties in Alabama’s 19th Circuit Court, only a handful of people have been charged with murder for a car accident in the span of a decade — and most wound up taking a plea deal for a lesser charge.
But this time around, the prosecutor’s offer could hardly be considered a deal at all: The teenager would have to plead guilty to murder, and it would be blind plea, meaning he would have to hope for mercy from the court in his sentencing. “In my 30 years of practicing law, I have never been offered a deal like that,” Ruiz’s court-appointed lawyer, Richard Lively, said.
The lead prosecutor eventually budged, but only a little. He wouldn’t reduce the charge, but he would recommend that the teenager spend 30 years in prison.
That’s longer than any other sentence handed down since at least 2004 for a car crash fatality in Alabama’s 19th Circuit Court, which includes Autauga, Chilton and Elmore counties. A man who fled the scene of a fatal crash — and had a 0.09 blood alcohol level nine hours later — received a 15-year sentence in 2017. A woman who had three times the legal limit of alcohol in her system received 23 years in 2007 after she killed a University of Alabama student.
For defendants who were teenagers when they caused fatal car accidents, the courts can be even more lenient. In 2012, a Madison County judge granted youthful offender status to a man who was 19 when he was charged with murder for a drunk driving crash that killed a high school sophomore in Huntsville. The driver, who had a blood alcohol level of 0.15, was sentenced to a year in jail and two on probation.
Lively had a hard time squaring his client’s charges with the results of his blood test and recorded speed. Alabama’s murder statute does not require a driver to be legally intoxicated, and people have faced murder charges for killing someone by racing or fleeing police. But neither applied here. Lively reasoned that for murder to fit, the teenager would have had to be intentionally driving into oncoming traffic.
He thought his client could beat the charge and told him not to plead guilty. Years later, attorneys involved in the case would attempt to shed light on what was so different about it — and on one fact in particular that they believed eclipsed all the others.
He was a Mexican immigrant.
The case against Ruiz was, as one legal expert put it, “a perfect storm of horrible facts.”
The night before the accident, he stayed up late after drinking at a music festival in Birmingham. At the scene of the crash, police found beer cans in his truck. He was in the country on a temporary work visa and did not have a driver’s license. He spoke little English, relying on his 17-year-old cousin to translate his Miranda rights and the string of questions from police.
The only reason Ruiz was in Autauga County was to visit his extended family after finishing a monthslong job in Georgia and South Carolina clearing brush from power lines. He was days away from returning to Mexico.
The woman he killed was named Marlena Hayes. She was a 29-year-old nurse who’d just finished the night shift at Prattville Baptist Hospital. She wasn’t even supposed to be working at that time. She’d planned to see her brother perform that weekend with the marching band at the University of West Alabama. In the end, though, she took the shift as a favor to a colleague.

Newspapers and TV stations in central Alabama quickly picked up the story. Some referred to Ruiz as an illegal immigrant even though he’d been in the U.S. on a six-month H-2B visa, which are approved when employers can’t find enough American workers. One of those articles appeared in the Montgomery Advertiser, the largest newspaper in the area.
When Lively was assigned to the case, he felt compelled to show that his client had been in the U.S. legally. Ruiz’s visa had only lapsed when he was in jail. Lively tracked down the Montgomery Advertiser reporter at the Autauga County courthouse to show him that Ruiz’s visa had been valid when he was arrested. But even after that, the newspaper failed to acknowledge that he was in the country legally at the time of the crash. “The Montgomery Advertiser stands behind our reporting,” the newspaper said in a statement released through its parent company, Gannett.
In the years leading up to Ruiz’s arrest, Alabama had established itself as a particularly unwelcoming place for foreigners. In 2011, then-Gov. Robert Bentley signed a bill that criminalized everyday activities like transporting, employing and renting homes to undocumented immigrants.
At the time, historians and legal experts worried the law could usher in a new era of racial injustice similar to Jim Crow that would be enforced by the police and courts. But the impact of the immigration law remains largely unknown because Alabama prisons don’t collect ethnicity data and therefore don’t know how many inmates are Hispanic. In 2013, the state agreed not to enforce most of the provisions as part of a lawsuit.
“The HB 56 legislation brought nativism and xenophobia into the political mainstream in Alabama” wrote historian Raymond Mohl. At the height of the debate over the law, a congressman from north Alabama said that to prevent illegal immigration to the state, he would do “anything short of shooting them.”
Back then, those harsh policies made Alabama an outlier. But with the election of President Donald Trump in 2016, the state’s positions started going mainstream. Alabama even supplied one of the foremost architects of Trump’s first-term immigration policy: U.S. Sen. Jeff Sessions, a fierce champion of border crackdowns, was tapped to be Trump’s attorney general.
Ruiz was arrested nearly two years into Trump’s first term. At the time, Alabama was growing more red even as a blue wave nationally elected dozens of Democrats to Congress. In Alabama, Republicans swept statewide office that year and expanded their majority in the Legislature.
Some members of Ruiz’s extended family had started moving to Alabama from Mexico nearly 15 years earlier and stayed in the area even after the political winds turned against them. Sandra Ruiz, his 17-year-old cousin, moved from Texas to Autauga County at age 2 and had lived near Prattville, a suburb of Montgomery, nearly all her life. She knew that some of her neighbors could be ignorant of, or even hostile to, people from Mexico. She and her family were afraid for Jorge Ruiz when he was arrested and followed the police to the station. Investigators allowed the high school senior to translate their questions and Ruiz’s responses.
A judge granted Ruiz bond in March 2019, four months after he was jailed. Ruiz’s family members in Alabama sold tamales and organized a raffle of an ornate belt buckle to raise funds for bail. They posted the money to free him.
And they began to wait.
In the weeks and months leading up to Ruiz’s trial, Judge Bill Lewis made several decisions that, according to Ruiz’s lawyer, put his client at a disadvantage.
One of the first things Lewis did was revoke Ruiz’s bond. Because of a technicality, Ruiz’s family never recovered the $5,000 they’d paid to get him out of jail. The news coverage that followed the decision sparked intense, and often misinformed, debate online about the case, and Lively worried that bias would affect potential jurors. Not long after Ruiz’s bond was revoked, the judge got a letter in the mail from a local resident. The writer thanked him and asked Lewis to “do everything in your power to get justice for Marlena.” The letter went on to describe Ruiz as “in this country illegally” and “operating his vehicle under the influence of alcohol.”
About a week later, Lewis denied Ruiz’s application for youthful offender status. That meant he would not be eligible for a sentence capped at three years. Lewis did not respond to a list of questions from ProPublica, including one about not granting Ruiz youthful offender status.
But as the trial neared, Lewis took several steps to attempt to keep bias out of the courtroom. He gave special instructions to the prosecution and the defense, barring any mention of Ruiz’s immigration status and directing attorneys involved in the case to call him “George.”
The judge’s efforts couldn’t erase the obvious difference between Ruiz and almost everyone else in the courtroom: the language barrier. “Longtime courthouse observers don’t recall a case in Prattville where an interpreter was used at trial,” the Montgomery Advertiser reported.
The district attorney had charged Ruiz under the reckless murder section of the statute, reserved for offenders who unintentionally cause a death. Courts have found that driving without a license, a misdemeanor that in Alabama carries a fine of $10 to $100, doesn’t constitute underlying recklessness for charges like manslaughter or murder. Prosecutors only briefly brought up at Ruiz’s trial that he did not have a license. What made the case amount to murder, the prosecutor said throughout the case, was that Ruiz was both speeding and had crossed the center line.
Ruiz’s use of alcohol also played a central role in the trial, even though he hadn’t been charged with DUI — and even though the prosecutors conceded that the evidence didn’t support that charge. A toxicologist testified that almost four hours had passed between the crash and the blood test at the hospital. He said the average elimination rate for alcohol is 0.015 percentage points an hour. That testimony suggested Ruiz’s blood alcohol level would have been higher than 0.07 at the time of the accident.
If the prosecutors could scientifically confirm that figure, it would have been enough to charge Ruiz with DUI because the legal intoxication threshold is lower for underage drivers. But such estimates have been described as unreliable by some scientists and legal experts, with one calling them no better than a “wild guess.” Some states have imposed higher bars than Alabama for the admission of such evidence, and at least one, Massachusetts, doesn’t allow it at all if the blood alcohol reading was, like Ruiz’s, below 0.03.
Lively produced no expert to dispute the toxicologist. In fact, he called only one witness, Ruiz’s date the night of the festival, who testified that Ruiz rode with her to her apartment after the festival, at around 1:30 a.m., and slept on the couch until he left at around 5 a.m.
Lively said in his closing argument that the evidence failed to show that Ruiz’s behavior was so brazenly dangerous that it amounted to murder.
“This was a person who was driving home and fell asleep behind the wheel,” Lively said.
Then-Chief Assistant District Attorney C.J. Robinson said there was no evidence Ruiz fell asleep. “In Alabama, we recognize that you can do something so dangerous that it could kill somebody, and you should realize what you’re doing is that dangerous,” he said during closing arguments. “I submit to you that anyone’s life was in danger, and therefore it was reckless murder.”
Jurors were instructed that, as an alternative to murder, they also could consider the lesser charges of manslaughter or criminally negligent homicide. They deliberated for less than an hour.
The foreman announced guilty verdicts on three counts: minor in possession of alcohol, driving without a license and murder.
Three weeks later, everyone gathered again for the sentencing. Robinson invited members of Hayes’ family to speak about their loss.
The family, along with friends, had come to every hearing. Hayes’ mother, Laura Liveoak, had spoken out on social media about her grief, describing how her daughter had texted her right before she left work that morning, asking what the weather was like. Liveoak said in a Facebook video: “It’s hard to be the parent of a victim, knowing that she’ll never be a mother. I’ll never be a grandmother to the sweet little redheaded kids that she probably would have had.” She declined to comment for this story.
Liveoak told the judge how much her daughter loved being a nurse: so much that she spent some of her days off visiting patients. She’d recently bought a house in a nearby town, Deatsville, and adopted two German shepherds who became the center of her world. She’d texted her mom right before she left work that morning. Her last message was about her dogs.

Then it was Ruiz’s turn. He spoke for the first time in court.
“I want to say that I am sorry to the family,” Ruiz said. “I wouldn’t have wished for this to happen. I wish that this would have only been a dream.”
Lewis peered down from the bench at Ruiz.
“This is America,” Lewis said. “It’s the greatest country in the world and we have the right to trial in this country. I would never penalize you for exercising that right, but Mr. Lively talked about acceptance of responsibility, contrition, remorse. I haven’t seen any of that from you.”
He sentenced Ruiz to the maximum possible punishment, longer even than the 50 years requested by prosecutors: 99 years.
The court went quiet. Even the prosecutor was shocked.
Years later, Robinson remembered that moment. “That was not something that I had expected,” he said.
In 2023, four years after the sentencing, a human rights lawyer from Mexico reached out to the Southern Center for Human Rights, a nonprofit law center in Atlanta that focuses on criminal justice. He let them know that the Mexican Consulate had been following Ruiz’s case from the time he was arrested through the slow-moving appeals process. His 99-year sentence had shocked them, and they wanted to find a lawyer in the U.S. who could steer the increasingly complicated appeal.
Ruiz’s family had cobbled together money for a private attorney, who filed motions to challenge his conviction and sentence. But they had run out of funds. Ruiz was preparing to represent himself when the attorneys from the center stepped in.
“I was like, ‘We need to help this kid,’” SCHR attorney Paulina Lucio-Maymon said. “Otherwise, he’s just gonna end up forgotten by the system.”
The Mexican Consulate connected Lucio-Maymon and her colleague Michael Admirand with family from Prattville, who in turn connected the attorneys with family in Ruiz’s hometown, José María Pino Suárez, in the Mexican state of Durango. Many in the small community knew Ruiz. As a young boy, he had helped his grandfather work a shared plot of farmland and manage his livestock. He dropped out after middle school to support his family and got his visa to come to the U.S. in the spring of 2018. He needed to make more money after his mother’s unexpected death.
“He was always trying to make sure everyone was taken care of,” said his cousin, Sandra Ruiz.
In the U.S., he was part of an all-immigrant crew of temporary visa workers employed by a contractor for the power company. The team trudged through Georgia and South Carolina backcountry, their feet snagging on roots and vines as they cleared vegetation from power lines. They often walked for 10 to 12 hours a day while carrying heavy canisters of weed-killing chemicals, and Ruiz suffered heat stroke twice, one of Ruiz’s fellow workers testified in an appeal hearing. Workers wore out their shoes every eight days, the worker said.

Ruiz wanted to spend his last few weeks in the U.S. visiting family in Prattville before returning to Mexico. He missed his daughter, Noeli, and had begun making plans for her third birthday.
None of that history had been presented at his sentencing hearing. His attorney also failed to highlight his clean criminal record in Mexico.
In September 2019, less than a month after he handed down that 99-year sentence, Lewis had issued an unusual order. He removed Lively from the case despite there being no motion seeking his removal. Lewis determined Ruiz had received inadequate representation.
Lewis cited an offhand comment Lively made at the sentencing hearing. In response to the judge admonishing Ruiz for not being contrite, Lively told the judge that the decision to take Ruiz’s case to trial “may be more of a reflection of my bad advice to him than his own acceptance of responsibility.” Lewis wrote that he saw that as an admission that Lively was questioning his own representation of Ruiz. (Lively later told ProPublica he was trying to “deflect some of Judge Lewis’ criticism of Jorge onto me” and lamented how “that one sentence has been used as a cudgel against me and a tool to scapegoat me in this case.”)
In the hearings and filings that followed, Lewis continued to express concerns about the information that had not been presented at trial or sentencing.
“The Court, when rendering a sentence in this case should have as much information as possible,” Lewis wrote in a more recent order. “Mr. Lively failed to provide any, despite having access to many different sources of information that could have affected the Defendant’s sentence.”
Lively did provide some evidence at Ruiz’s sentencing, calling his aunt and cousin to testify. The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals later rejected a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel against him.
In a statement to ProPublica, Lively wrote that he believed he competently defended Ruiz. He said that he only called one trial witness because he felt the state had not proven his client’s guilt. He pointed to the state’s experts, who testified that Ruiz had a very low level of alcohol in his system and drifted slowly into oncoming traffic, which, according to Lively, showed Ruiz did not intentionally jerk the car across the center line. “The most powerful witness is one that is called by the opposition who proves your case,” Lively wrote.
He also described the case as “the most traumatic” he’s encountered in his 30 years as an attorney. “I have made the law my life’s work, and Jorge’s case caused me to question almost everything I believed about the legal system,” he wrote.
When Lucio-Maymon and Admirand first took on Ruiz’s case, they appealed both his murder conviction and his 99-year sentence. Lewis rejected their challenge of Ruiz’s conviction but agreed the sentence deserved another look.
To make their case for a shorter sentence, Ruiz’s attorneys compiled information about other fatal car crash cases. His former attorneys had appealed his conviction to the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals and lost. The one notable dissent on the panel of judges was penned by Republican Judge J. William Cole, who wrote that the facts did not support a murder conviction.
“Ruiz had consumed alcohol before the accident, but he was not determined to be legally intoxicated, nor was he charged with driving under the influence of alcohol,” Cole wrote. “Although he crossed to the wrong side of the road, there was no evidence that he was racing or driving in a grossly wanton manner.”
Admirand and Lucio-Maymon looked at the four cases cited in the decision to uphold his conviction. The drivers in those cases had blood alcohol levels that ranged from 0.16 to 0.3 — from double to nearly quadruple the level of criminal intoxication. Their sentences ranged from 12 to 25 years in prison.
The attorneys created a simple graph that compared those sentences and blood alcohol levels. Although Ruiz had the lowest amount of alcohol in his system, his sentence was by far the longest.
After Lewis granted a new sentencing hearing, Admirand and Lucio-Maymon felt hopeful. That disparity — along with testimony from Ruiz’s friends and family in Mexico — could help sway the judge toward mercy, they believed. They said they even started talking with the district attorney’s office with the goal of making a deal, though Robinson said he remembered those conversations differently. He recalled that he agreed to listen to evidence about Ruiz’s background but wouldn’t consider reducing the charge and would be hard-pressed to recommend less than 50 years.
“They did initially express some openness to discussion in this case,” Admirand said. “And then something changed.”
Although Lewis had presided over Ruiz’s trial and granted him a resentencing hearing, he was not behind the bench when Ruiz was set to be resentenced in 2024. By then, Lewis had been appointed to the Alabama Court of Civil Appeals.
The case was transferred to Sibley Reynolds, who had retired from the bench but still took cases as needed. When Admirand and Lucio-Maymon arrived early on Aug. 14, 2024, to prepare, they found the judge sitting in the courtroom, paging through a purple binder they had never seen before. It contained pictures of Hayes and letters from friends, family members and even a few local officials.
Each of the dozens of letters urged the judge to uphold Ruiz’s 99-year sentence. Prosecutors asked the judge for 50 years. Lucio-Maymon and Admirand, citing several sentences from cases across the 19th Circuit Court, were seeking 10 years.
Admirand said he watched as Reynolds carried the binder with him to the bench. The hearing he oversaw was short but eventful. At one point, Ruiz addressed Hayes’ family.
“I am profoundly sorry for having caused you this pain,” he said. “I want to say I’m sorry or forgive me, the way I have asked God to do every day during the almost six years.”
Admirand presented all the evidence he believed had been missing from Ruiz’s first sentencing hearing in 2019. He told the judge about the cases they had found in the same judicial district with sentences that ranged from one to 25 years. And he presented mitigating factors — witnesses who testified about Ruiz’s character and work ethic.
His attorneys also played a series of videos of family members in Mexico, accompanied by dramatic music.
When Robinson, who had been elected district attorney in 2022, started to make his argument against Ruiz, he invoked a patriotic anthem as a sort of rebuttal. He said the victim’s family was ready to move on and that he was going to make a case for them “courtesy of the red, white and blue.”
It was a reference to the title of the Toby Keith song “Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue,” which includes lyrics like, “We’ll put a boot in your ass, it’s the American way.” Robinson would later tell ProPublica the comment was taken out of context and was meant as a critique of the music in the video, which he described as “manipulative.”
Shortly after, Hayes’ mother asked the judge to uphold the original sentence.
“I’m asking for the 99 years that Judge Lewis saw fit to give,” she said. “Marlena’s life is worth that and so much more.”
At the end of the hearing, the judge announced his decision: He would reduce Ruiz’s sentence to 50 years.
He didn’t offer an explanation for why he chose what’s still an unusually long sentence. Admirand suspected the reason might be found in the purple binder. He objected to the judge considering it without the defense having seen it. He then asked for a copy of the material.
“I mean, it’s literally letters from the victim’s family,” said Assistant District Attorney Mandy Johnson in response to the objection.
When Admirand read it right after the hearing, he found much more than that, including notes from local public officials and incorrect information about the case. He said that, more alarmingly, there were letters that included language he considered biased. One letter said that if Ruiz was released early and deported, he would surely return to the U.S.
“He will again commit crimes,” the letter said. “He will again be a draw on our judicial system and society itself. He will once again be an unnecessary threat to all our lives, including yours.”
“Fry him!” demanded another one.

The binder presented an opportunity to challenge what Admirand had come to believe was an underlying bias that permeated the case from the first moments after the crash, when a state trooper threatened to take Ruiz to jail if he did not speak English. In September 2024, he and Lucio-Maymon filed a motion for a new trial, arguing that the letters contained improper references to Ruiz’s nationality, including racially derogatory claims. In February, the Mexican Consulate filed an amicus brief in support of the appeal, only the second time in five years it has done that in a criminal case in the United States.
“Ruiz’s equal protection rights were violated from the moment this prosecution began,” the appeal said. “From his earliest interactions with law enforcement through the resentencing proceedings, Ruiz was treated more harshly than other similarly situated defendants because of his race. The Court should remedy this injustice.”
In June, Ruiz’s attorneys identified another 17 car crash cases over 15 years that were heard in the 19th Circuit Court. Most defendants received sentences of less than 15 years in prison, even in cases involving multiple fatalities or high blood alcohol levels. Only one, Ruiz, had a sentence longer than 25 years. Robinson argued those cases were different, though not because of the defendant’s race. Defendants in most of them had accepted plea deals. He did not acknowledge that all of those plea deals were more lenient than the one offered to Ruiz.
Lewis did not respond to questions, including ones about alleged bias in the case. In response to ProPublica’s questions, Robinson wrote that neither he nor the district attorney’s office “treated Jorge Ruiz more harshly than other similarly situated defendants because of his race.”
Though the district attorney’s office did not charge Ruiz with DUI, Robinson wrote that alcohol “was illegally consumed at a rate much higher than legally permissible for Ruiz to be operating a vehicle.” He also wrote, “I do not assess cases using a least common denominator approach. I do my best to evaluate them based on a totality of the circumstances approach.”
In August, the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals asked for more information from Reynolds about his reasoning behind the 50-year sentence. Admirand and Lucio-Maymon have asked the court to take Reynolds off the case, arguing that he improperly reviewed the purple binder material. Reynolds did not respond to ProPublica’s questions.
Hayes’ family members have been outspoken about their loss. At every hearing, they tick off the milestones Hayes has missed. Her brother’s graduation. Her sister’s wedding. The births of nieces and nephews.
Ruiz’s family members are quietly marking off their own list. His daughter’s kindergarten graduation, her First Communion. The 9-year-old still doesn’t quite comprehend where he has gone.
Ruiz has learned a little English but still struggles with the language. He said through his attorneys that he’s never been able to adequately convey how bad he feels about the accident. It’s not just the language barrier, but also that his role in Hayes’ death left him so distraught that he felt like “my life didn’t matter anymore.”
Still, the hearing last year that reduced his sentence kindled some optimism. He said that when he first faced the prospect of 99 years behind bars, the only thing he could think about was never seeing his daughter again. After the hearing, his outlook changed.
“That gave me back hope that one day I’ll be able to see my family again,” Ruiz said.

Dubbed by fans and peers as the King of Reality TV, the Detroit-born producer has built franchises that travel beyond the coasts. His “Love & Marriage” franchise has turned Huntsville, Alabama, Detroit and Washington into must-see television along with “Family Empire: Houston.” His other hit “Belle Collective” put Jackson, Mississippi, on the cultural map and returned with a new season this month on OWN.
As a former “Real Housewives of Atlanta” producer, King is showing that compelling stories thrive wherever real people live, love and grind. Through his company, Kingdom Reign Entertainment, he says more than 60% of OWN’s original programming carries his imprint, crediting the network’s top executives such as Oprah Winfrey, Tina Perry and Drew Tappon for backing his vision.
Beyond television, King has expanded his reach with the popular podcast “Reality with the King” and on-camera hosting, cementing his status as both creator and voice of the culture.
In a recent conversation with The Associated Press, King opened up about independence, building generational wealth, navigating racism and homophobia as an openly gay Black man. He also touches on how he feels about being called the “Black Andy Cohen,” a nod to the “Real Housewives” executive producer and late-night host who became Bravo’s on-air face.
AP: What does the “King of Reality TV” mean to you?
KING: It solidifies my place in this business of unscripted television. Having a successful production company, Kingdom Reign Television, having the No. 1 show on Oprah Winfrey’s Network, “Love and Marriage Huntsville,” to a number one podcast, “Reality with the King,” so all those things are underneath me, my brand and my empire. The title means a lot to me and my brand. The audience understands I’m multifaceted and multitalented. It holds a lot of weight, but I’m definitely somebody that understands the assignment.
AP: Why is ownership such a priority for you?
KING: In our business, unfortunately, you create a show and you’re at the mercy of the network, which is just our business. And that’s just the way things are, right? You do the work and once you sell the show to the network, you don’t own the show anymore. I’m all about ownership and the fact that if I put in the sweat equity, then I want all of the profits. I want all of the margins coming to me because I did the work, I created the idea. I found the cast. I developed the show. I want to own everything that I do, and that’s where my vision is right now.
The beauty of my podcast is the fact that I own it. No one can tell me what to do with it. Those opportunities of ownership is fantastic because you’re able to really create your own destiny and look for partnerships that makes sense versus doing the archaic way of this business that I just don’t have the desire to do anymore.
AP: How have you navigated systemic barriers?
KING: I have seen it all, I’ve been through it all: homophobia, racism. I’ve seen that all of my life, personal and professional. However, for me, I never allowed that to be my disadvantage. I found ways to make that my superpower. I found ways to make sure that I stood up for myself and for my people in meetings, in conversations, and inappropriate discussions where shade was thrown very subliminally. I allowed myself to be a disrupter in a very different way.

I didn’t feel the need to be super outspoken in the moment and made a scene out of it. Because I knew that if I did that, I wouldn’t be asked back to do the job. I knew to stand up for myself and my community in a way that was digestible to them. But I always knew that you have learned a valuable lesson, and you take these conversations that are happening around you, and you allow that to fuel you into being an agent of change in other situations.
AP: What are the three keys to building a successful reality show?
KING: No. 1, the cast. A show lives or dies by the cast. You got to find a great cast. No. 2 is what’s the angle? If I did a show about a group of Black people in Atlanta … oh right, kind of seen it. But if I do a show about Black couples in Huntsville. Well, that piques my interest. Tell me more about it. Find the angle that isn’t already out there. No. 3, authenticity is key. Have an authentic group of people who want to share their lives.
The three things that don’t work:
First is a group of cast members who do not want to share their reality. You’re losing. Two, an angle that is familiar. I get pitched sometimes, “I’m going do a show about X, Y and Z.” And I’m like, “That’s already on the air. There’s nothing special about that. Take another big swing at the idea.” Find out what’s missing on television and create that yourself. Don’t create another copy of a show that’s already on the air. And No. 3, fakeness. Oh my gosh, the audience can spot a fake. I can spot a fake.
AP: Why did you set “Love & Marriage” in Huntsville and “Belle Collective” in Jackson?
KING: I wanted to tap into a market that I felt was underserved and just wasn’t getting their just due. I wanted to tell Black stories in inner cities and towns that aren’t prevalent like a LA, New York, Miami. I wanted to be able to show the world that these people do exist, and they should not be forgotten about. Not a lot of people, including me, have heard of Huntsville until I met some of the people and I’m like, “Oh, you guys have a great story.”
AP: How do you feel about being referred to as the Black version of Andy Cohen?
KING: I want people to really pay attention to the individualism that we both offer in this community of unscripted. For me, when it comes to my legacy, I feel very confident that people are now seeing the difference between (him) and I, and they’re now seeing the amount of work I’m doing with my podcast, my YouTube channel, the work that I’m doing with creating shows in different parts of the world that are untapped. They’re seeing more of that. I want them to keep watching because it’s only going to get better.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/08160052/AP25235138539127.jpg,,,2025-10-11 08:57:06.935387

(Clark Corbin/Idaho Capital Sun)As the former administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, my job was to protect both public health and the environment, including protecting Americans from toxic exposures. In that mission, the EPA and the Make America Healthy Again movement are aligned. Children cannot thrive in a degraded environment, and it’s up to agencies like EPA and the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality to safeguard the most vulnerable. Together, they are on the front lines of Making America Healthy Again.
We’ve recently seen a pernicious narrative begin to circulate that the state of Idaho “quietly rewrote” its cancer regulations to benefit Idaho’s Stibnite Gold Project, and in doing so, put children’s health at risk.
Let’s be clear: That’s not what happened.
U.S. Forest Service approves Stibnite Gold Mine in Central Idaho

The Stibnite Gold Project has been carefully studied, engineered and permitted over the course of 16 years. This is not a slapdash process, but one rooted in science and wrapped in safeguards to protect workers, communities and the environment.
Idaho DEQ didn’t rewrite the rulebook on assessing cancer risks; in fact, it used the EPA’s. The EPA has a conservative, gold standard methodology for assessing health risk. It’s been used for decades, and is designed to be protective of sensitive populations, like pregnant women and children.
Using EPA and Idaho DEQ’s standard formula, regulators considered the project’s maximum possible arsenic emissions if the mine operates all day, every day, for 16 straight years, which is an extremely conservative assumption that cannot in fact occur under actual operational constraints.
Nonetheless, based on this conservative assumption, Idaho DEQ calculated the lifetime additional cancer risk from project emissions to be four in one million or about 1 in 240,000; Idaho’s protective standard is 1 in 100,000, which means the excess cancer risk from the project is 41% less than what Idaho law requires. To further put that in perspective, the odds of being struck by lightning in your lifetime are 1 in 15,000.
The conclusion? Emissions from the Stibnite Gold Project do not pose unacceptable excess cancer risk for anyone.
Claims that Idaho somehow bent the rules to accommodate the project were tested in a full administrative hearing before an independent hearing officer, during which multiple toxicologists, scientists and permit engineers testified. After reviewing the evidence, the hearing officer concluded that Idaho correctly applied the risk assessment methodology and wholly rejected litigants’ claims. The Idaho DEQ Board unanimously upheld that decision.
Zooming out, while this debate has focused on permitting and risk methodology, Idahoans deserve to understand the broader picture and why this project matters:
The Stibnite Gold Project will supply the only American reserve of the critical mineral antimony, which is controlled by China. We need antimony for our national defense, our military needs it for artillery, munitions, and equipment. We also need it for civilian and renewable energy uses, including batteries and semiconductors.
The United States sets the gold standard for environmental regulations while China has terrible environmental practices. The choice is to mine antimony and other minerals in an environmentally responsible manner in the U.S. or rely on China and others who will increase global pollution through their mining practices.
What’s more, this project will actually remediate the environment and eliminate toxins polluting the environment today. The Stibnite Gold Project sits on an abandoned mine site, where one ton of arsenic currently flows into the river every single year. This project will pick up and reprocess 10 million tons of mine waste and tailings, get heavy metals out of Idaho rivers, and make the environment cleaner and safer for everyone.
We must encourage projects like this in order to address the waste from abandoned mining sites that plague the West.
Protecting people and the environment is the core mission of environmental regulators. EPA standards are deliberately conservative, independent experts vet the data, and this project was only approved after demonstrating it would protect both human health and the environment. The Stibnite Gold Project doesn’t clash with MAHA — it embodies it.
Suggesting otherwise isn’t advocacy, it’s fearmongering. Idaho families deserve decisions grounded in science, transparency and truth. On all counts, the Stibnite Gold Project meets the mark.

(Photo: John Partipilo)The Vanderbilt Faculty Senate, an elected body composed of deans and representative faculty members, has formally opposed entering into a compact with the Trump administration to comply with new directives in exchange for preferential access to funding.
In an emergency meeting Wednesday, the senate passed a resolution that condemned the proposed compact as a likely violation of state and federal law, and an infringement on the constitutional rights of university members.
“The Faculty Senate of Vanderbilt University firmly opposes this Compact as written and calls upon Chancellor (Daniel) Diermeier and the Board of Trust to also reject this Compact outright as well as any similar proposal compromising the mission, values and independence of the University,” the resolution said. 
The resolution was enacted with a 30-11 vote with one member abstaining.
Vanderbilt campus groups push back against Trump administration higher ed ‘compact’

The demand that Vanderbilt and eight other elite universities sign onto the so-called “Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education,” whose details were first reported in the Wall Street Journal, has drawn criticism from campus groups and free speech advocates. 
The 10-page proposed contract would require the schools to adhere to a number of ideological goals set by the Trump administration. Among them is that campus faculty and employees abstain from actions and speech about off-campus political events, capping foreign student enrollment and a commitment to use “lawful force if necessary,” to combat protests that impede access to campus facilities.
The directives, the resolution said, “”contains provisions antithetical to the missions and traditions of the university” and “endanger(s) the independence and integrity of the university.”
A Vanderbilt spokesperson referred to a statement posted on the university’s X account that said, “we look forward to carefully reviewing the compact and providing meaningful feedback to the administration.”
In addition to Vanderbilt, letters proposing the compact were sent to Brown University, Dartmouth College, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Arizona, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Southern California, the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Virginia.

But as a small business owner who relies on data-powered advertising, analytics, and personalized outreach to customers, I was alarmed to see Maine lawmakers downplay the risks of adopting rigid “data minimization” rules like those in the Maryland Online Privacy Rights Act. Maryland’s law is an outlier, going further than even California or Europe in restricting how data can be collected and used. If Maine were to enact similar provisions, it would seriously hurt small businesses like mine.
Fourteen years ago, my wife and I started making soy-wax candles in a boathouse on our Edgecomb property. Today, we sell our candles in L.L. Bean, Whole Foods, and specialty retailers nationwide, as well as from our own studio in Edgecomb, Boothbay Harbor store, and online shop. 
Data plays a critical role in our business’s growth. Aggregated data — showing things like which products most interest our customers and the regions where our products are popular — helps us understand our customer base and improve our marketing. And past-purchase data allows us to tell existing customers about new products or special deals, helping build customer loyalty. 
In addition, our digital advertising partners use non-personally identifiable data to show our ads to people most likely to be interested in our products — for example, people who’ve been searching online for candles or gift shops in our area. That means we don’t waste money advertising to people who aren’t interested in scented candles. And data analytics from our partners show which ads are most effective, allowing us to pull or tweak poor performers. In short, data helps us make the most of our small marketing and advertising budget — enabling us to connect with customers, generate sales, compete with much bigger manufacturers, and grow our business.
“Data minimization” rules would prevent Maine small businesses like ours from fully leveraging data for these critical purposes, because they’d limit us to using customers’ data only to provide products or services customers specifically requested. If we can’t use data to inform and power our marketing and advertising, we’ll struggle to understand and reach customers — and make sales. And because the data in question is non-personally identifiable, the benefit to consumers’ privacy would be minimal.
Protecting consumers’ privacy is important. But overregulating data would make it harder for Maine small businesses to survive and grow — at a time when we’re already struggling with economic uncertainty, inflation, and tariffs. I know that lawmakers are well-intentioned, but they also need to be realistic about how data regulations will affect small businesses. Mainers will be best served by balanced legislation that safeguards consumers’ data while allowing small businesses to grow, compete, and succeed.

(Alex Brandon/AP)In one of his stand-up sets, comedian David Cross rejects all political commentary that tries to answer the question, “What would America’s Founding Fathers think if they were alive today?”
For Cross, it is pointless to speculate about the present-day views of men who could not have imagined cotton candy, let alone the machine that makes it.
“What’s a machine? What’s a machine???” he screams in their collective voice, recoiling from the sorcery of the state fair.
The first time I saw this bit, something odd happened. Having just read the 1776 political pamphlet “Common Sense,” I could hear its author, one of America’s founders, laughing louder than anybody.
That would be Thomas Paine, the man credited with turning the American Revolution from a complicated Colonial fracas into a titanic struggle for the soul of liberty itself.
If Cross is skeptical that anything 250 years old still holds up, Paine, were he alive today, could probably name one thing: skepticism. Ways of thinking and being do not grow out of the ground; we make them ourselves, then hand them down as best we can. Paine would smile to see his favorite heirloom, the skeptical worldview, still intact.
Saying “no” — especially to those in power — is an underrated American pastime, and Paine was its Babe Ruth. If you plan on joining No Kings rallies and have yet to find a slogan for your sign, Paine’s got you covered: “In America, the law is king!” “No King! No Tyranny!” “Monarchy hath poisoned the republic.”
I could go on. Because he did.
 
Birth of a revolutionary
Where did all this anti-monarchical fire come from? Originally, from a small town in Norfolk, England, in 1737. Turning from his father’s trade of corset-making, Paine tried his hand at business, met and impressed Benjamin Franklin in London, sailed to America, and there found his true métier as a pamphleteer and radical.
Using simple yet incandescent prose, Paine renounced, repudiated and ridiculed at a clip seldom witnessed in print before or since. Hereditary privilege, colonialism, the supernatural: no, no, no.
But what Paine made his name lambasting — what he knocked out of the park with almost steroidal force — were kings. All of them, from the figures of ancient legend and Scripture to those who warmed England’s throne during his lifetime.
“Common Sense,” his first major work, was an urgent wake-up call to every light-sleeping lover of liberty within earshot. In that pamphlet, Paine labels kingship “the most prosperous invention the Devil ever set on foot for the promotion of idolatry.” He never minced words; he wanted the right people to choke on them.
 
‘Simple facts, plain arguments’
Exactly what was Paine’s problem with kings?
The same problem you’ll have, “Common Sense” promises, when you examine the evidence.
This is partly the secret of Paine’s rhetorical power: It’s difficult to imagine any wordsmith demanding more vigorously that you not take his word for it.
Paine was a student of history, and history is chock-full of receipts. It shows that abuses of kingly power extend back to the “early ages of monarchy,” when some “principal ruffian” first took power, and “it was very easy, after the lapse of a few generations, to trump up some superstitious tale, conveniently timed … to cram hereditary right down the throats of the vulgar.”
Since that time, says Paine, even those fortunate enough to live under benevolent rule have seldom been more than one generation away from yet another dreadful monarch.
“One of the strongest NATURAL proofs of the folly of hereditary right in kings, is, that nature disapproves it, otherwise she would not so frequently turn it into ridicule by giving mankind an ASS FOR A LION.” What a tweet this would have made, caps and all.
 
Bring the Paine
The only thing Paine liked less than monarchical rule was its enablers, anyone who relinquished their freedom willingly to an aspiring tyrant.
This is not only wrong, Paine insists, but against nature, since all of us are created equal.
But even that’s not the worst part. Those who sacrifice their own freedom on the altar of monarchy also sacrifice that of future generations. Their “unwise, unjust, unnatural compact might (perhaps) in the next succession put them under the government of a rogue or a fool.” Ouch.
“Most wise men,” Paine adds, “in their private sentiments, have ever treated hereditary right with contempt; yet it is one of those evils, which when once established is not easily removed; many submit from fear, others from superstition, and the more powerful part shares with the king the plunder of the rest.”
Federal worker firings, court settlements, a government shutdown. Paine would loathe how right the U.S. is proving him.
Besides criticizing both tradition and manipulative elites for their role in abetting monarchs, Paine’s writing gestures toward a more widely accessible sense of false freedom that comes with getting what you want from whoever happens to wear the crown.
This kind of pleasure obscures a painful reality: that the tyrant can strike as well as stroke.
The problem of unchecked power is not nearly counterbalanced by any number of indulgences the wielder of that power deigns to bestow. Freedom, Paine insists, is not transactional; whatever price you name, you’re getting fleeced.
Or, to put it his way: “O ye that love mankind! Ye that dare oppose, not only the tyranny, but the tyrant, stand forth!”

(Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images)If there were a trophy for squandering opportunity, Nebraska would already have it on the shelf.
On Sept. 3, the Nebraska Broadband Office, or NBO, released its draft final proposal for how to spend $405 million in federal broadband funds. Advocates for rural broadband like myself fought hard for that money, challenging providers’ overstated coverage and identifying tens of thousands of missing locations.
The federal Broadband Equity Access and Deployment program, or BEAD, promised to fix rural broadband in Nebraska once and for all. Instead, NBO fumbled. Out of $405 million, the plan spends barely $43 million and connects fewer than 1,300 locations to fiber broadband. More than $350 million is left untouched, likely to go back to D.C. without benefiting our state. That’s not planning. It is malpractice.
Fiber is permanent infrastructure. It is reliable, weatherproof and built to last for decades. It is the backbone of education, healthcare, precision agriculture, artificial intelligence, manufacturing and remote work.
NBO’s alternative? Fixed wireless and satellite. Both have their place, and they aren’t inherently bad solutions for rural connectivity. But their performance, reliability and future scalability pale in comparison to fiber. Relegating over 10,000 rural homes and businesses to second-class broadband is a disservice to every Nebraskan — a patch job, not progress. Betting Nebraska’s future on them is like renting a tent in tornado alley and calling it a house.
NBO claims Nebraska’s proposal is “connecting homes, businesses and community anchor institutions.” Optimistic and only half-true. More than 700 schools, libraries, fire departments and health centers were identified as eligible for BEAD’s funding for that purpose. NBO chose to connect only 54.
NBO’s biggest misstep was how it handled location eligibility. Nebraska started with nearly 30,000 eligible locations. Then NBO let unlicensed wireless providers claim coverage without proof. No maps. No evidence. Just “trust us.” Overnight, 7,500 locations were suddenly reclassified as “served.” Add in federal map changes, and Nebraska lost 52% of its list. Most states cut none.
Then there are the satellites. NBO is spending $2.3 million on Amazon’s Project Kuiper, a service with zero customers and a handful of test satellites in orbit. The proposal trusts Jeff Bezos’ hobby project to serve 1,500 Nebraskans. SpaceX’s Starlink, which already covers Nebraska, gets another $2.5 million to serve places it already serves. This is internet meant to power a campsite, not an economy.
Transparency is scarce. Since Sept. 3, NBO has revised its project list three times, each time cutting funding for schools and libraries with neither explanation nor notice. Just moving numbers around and leaving the public and providers in the dark.
Meanwhile, our neighbors are lapping us. Iowa and Kansas, with the same “flat and treeless” terrain Nebraska used as an excuse, each connected about half of their locations to fiber. Wyoming and Montana, with tougher topography, managed two to three times Nebraska’s fiber commitment. North Dakota? 93% fiber. Nebraska? Dead last — an outlier in the worst way.
Yes, the rules changed. Yes, it made the job harder. But the job is not to roll over when Washington makes things difficult. The job is to fight for Nebraskans, not fold. That is surrender, not leadership.
Excuses might make the politics easier, but they do not bring lasting infrastructure to our farms, schools, businesses and families. If other states can push back and still commit to fiber, Nebraska could too.
Our state’s chance at full connectivity is fading before our eyes. Nebraska appears poised to leave more than $350 million on the table and lock rural communities into second-rate service.
Nebraskans didn’t fight for $405 million to watch it evaporate. Fiber is the gold standard, and we deserve leaders with the backbone to deliver it. Anything less is a betrayal of every family, farmer, business and student left behind on the wrong side of the digital divide.

(Sandra Mu/Getty Images)The Nebraska Broadband Office (NBO) is proud to announce the achievement of our most significant milestone – the allocation of more than $42 million in Broadband, Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) Program awards to connect the final 14,032 unserved and underserved Nebraska locations to high-speed, reliable broadband.
These awards, pending final approval by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), represent the biggest step yet toward total connectivity in our state.
This achievement is the result of years of steady effort, persistence and adaptation to changing federal guidance. NBO has worked tirelessly to meet every requirement of the BEAD program while keeping our focus on the needs of Nebraskans.
Creation of the NBO was one of Gov. Jim Pillen’s first initiatives. Our work now is to carry out his vision to meet Nebraska’s broadband needs — especially in rural communities — by ensuring access that is affordable, reliable and high-speed.
The final 14,000 locations are the most challenging to connect. These are the places that providers have historically been reluctant to serve, as evidenced by the lack of applications to serve them received by our office.
For the first time, every one of these locations now has a firm commitment to receive the same quality of broadband service available in our most connected communities. This is an extraordinary accomplishment that reflects a commitment to broadband for all.
Nebraska’s plan embraces every solution, creating a deployment strategy that is practical and forward-looking. These technologies not only exceed NTIA’s current requirements but are evolving rapidly, operating at the cutting edge and advancing before our eyes. Most importantly, this approach gets service to families and businesses faster.
Our plan also extends impact beyond homes and businesses by connecting 54 community anchor institutions, such as libraries, hospitals and fire stations that serve as vital hubs for communities. This new infrastructure will strengthen Nebraska’s capacity for healthcare, education and emergency response while laying infrastructure that nearby communities can build upon.
Our work will not stop here. As of this proposal, approximately $324.6 million of Nebraska’s BEAD allocation remains unspent. NBO is aggressively working to keep these funds in the state. This would allow us to pursue non-deployment investments that will multiply the impact of these funds – enhancing precision agriculture, expanding access to healthcare technologies, supporting digital workforce readiness and preparing communities for an AI-driven economy.
These efforts, combined with our deployment plan, will broaden opportunities for every Nebraskan, ensuring that both our people and our communities thrive in a rapidly evolving world.
This plan reflects the very best of Nebraska: persistence, adaptability and innovation. By combining the strengths of multiple technologies and preparing for what comes next, we are setting the stage for a broadband network that will serve Nebraskans today and keep our state at the forefront of connectivity tomorrow.

(Photo courtesy U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement)Maryland police leaders face an unprecedented crisis in American law enforcement. The Trump administration’s deployment of masked federal agents, militarization of immigration enforcement and attempted use of National Guard troops for civilian policing represents a fundamental threat to constitutional governance and professional law enforcement.
The current federal approach bears little resemblance to traditional law enforcement. More than 75% of people booked into Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody in fiscal year 2025 had no criminal conviction other than an immigration or traffic-related offense, with less than 10% convicted of serious crimes like murder, assault, robbery or rape.
This isn’t targeted enforcement of dangerous criminals; it’s indiscriminate sweeps of immigrant communities.
Federal agents hide their faces during arrests. U.S. citizens have been detained by masked agents in plain clothes. These are methods of authoritarian regimes, not constitutional democracies.
Federal law enforcement resources are being diverted wholesale from their core missions. FBI agents, U.S. Marshals, ATF agents, DEA agents and Homeland Security personnel who should be investigating terrorism, organized crime, drug-related crimes and white-collar crimes are instead conducting immigration sweeps.
Against this backdrop, Maryland’s expansion of 287(g) participation from three to eight sheriff’s offices in 2025 entangles local police in a fundamentally compromised federal operation. When Maryland agencies sign 287(g) agreements, they become part of a system that operates without accountability, violates constitutional norms and destroys community trust.

Research shows 287(g) programs significantly reduce violent crime reporting among victims. In Maryland’s diverse communities, home to significant immigrant populations in Baltimore, Montgomery County, Prince George’s County, Frederick County and elsewhere, domestic violence victims won’t call police, witnesses won’t cooperate with homicide investigations and human-trafficking victims will remain hidden – subjected to greater risk.
The current federal immigration enforcement crisis makes community policing principles more essential than ever. Decades of research demonstrate that effective policing requires community cooperation, trust and legitimacy. When communities view police as partners in public safety, crime reporting increases, witness cooperation improves and crime prevention becomes possible.
Many Maryland agencies have invested in community policing models, building relationships with neighborhood groups and earning legitimacy through fair treatment of all residents. These relationships take years to build but can be destroyed overnight.
The Trump administration’s aggressive tactics are already creating fear in immigrant communities across Maryland. Children are afraid to go to school. Workers won’t report wage theft or workplace safety violations. Domestic violence victims are staying in dangerous situations.
For Maryland police leaders, this environment demands a choice: Double down on community policing efforts or sacrifice community trust and collaborative problem solving for politicized federal immigration priorities. There is no middle ground.
Professional law enforcement organizations, the Police Executive Research Forum, Major Cities Chiefs Association and International Association of Chiefs of Police, all warn that immigration enforcement by local police fundamentally undermines community trust and public safety.
Maryland chiefs and sheriffs have professional and constitutional obligations that transcend federal pressure. They must maintain operational independence, protect constitutional policing, preserve community relationships, consider exiting 287(g) where applicable, resist militarization and document federal overreach.
Maryland has worked for decades to professionalize law enforcement, implement community policing and build trust with diverse populations. Community policing isn’t just a buzzword – it’s an operational necessity that enables police to solve crimes, prevent violence and maintain public safety.
This moment demands that Maryland police leaders remember why community policing principles emerged in the first place: because enforcement-only models don’t work. Aggressive, militarized policing that treats communities as occupied territory creates the conditions for crime to flourish by destroying the community cooperation that effective policing requires.
The question facing Maryland police leaders isn’t whether immigration law should be enforced, that’s a federal policy matter. The question is whether local police will maintain their professional integrity and constitutional obligations in the face of federal overreach.
The evidence is clear: 287(g) participation exacerbates every problem created by the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement tactics. Maryland police leaders who prioritize public safety, constitutional governance and professional policing must reject this false choice between federal cooperation and their core mission. Their loyalty is to the Constitution, to professional standards and to the communities they serve, not to a federal administration that has abandoned all three.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/54348554551_ce02f39035_o-1024x680.jpg,,,2025-10-11 00:57:08.108551

On Thursday, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) canceled an environmental review of the Esmeralda Seven Solar Project – a sprawling development of seven geographically contiguous utility-scale solar projects that would cover more than 62,000 acres  nearly 100 square miles — of public land about 30 miles west of Tonopah, Nevada.
The joint project was proposed by six solar energy companies, including NextEra Energy Resources, Leeward Renewable Energy, Arevia Power and Invenergy.
All together, the network of solar panels and batteries in Esmeralda County was expected to produce as much as 6.2 gigawatts of energy under ideal conditions, or enough electricity to power nearly two million homes.

After months of delays, the Department of the Interior this week said it was canceling its broad environmental review of the joint project and would instead review the seven projects that make up the development separately “to more effectively analyze potential impacts.”
The Department of the Interior said the impacted energy companies will now have the option to submit a separate application for their individual project proposals. 
“The BLM did not cancel the project. During routine discussions prior to the lapse in appropriations, the proponents and BLM agreed to change their approach for the Esmeralda 7 Solar Project in Nevada,” said an Interior spokesperson in an email Friday.
“Instead of pursuing a programmatic level environmental analysis, the applicants will now have the option to submit individual project proposals to the BLM to more effectively analyze potential impacts,” the email continued. 
It’s unclear how many of the impacted solar companies will continue to pursue their individual projects after the change in how the proposals will be reviewed.
A spokesperson for NextEra Energy Resources said the company was committed to their individual project – the Esmeralda Energy Center – which is a part of the Esmeralda Seven Solar Project. 
“NextEra Energy Resources is one of six companies pursuing projects in Esmeralda County, Nevada. We are in the early stage of development and remain committed to pursuing our project’s comprehensive environmental analysis by working closely with the Bureau of Land Management,” a spokesperson for NextEra Energy Resources said in an email Friday. 
A spokesperson for Leeward Energy, one of the companies involved in the Esmeralda Seven Solar Project, said “we don’t have any information to share regarding the project update.”
Representatives for the other four energy companies involved in developing the Esmeralda Seven Solar Project did not respond to requests for comment.
Kevin Emmerick, the co-founder of Basin and Range Watch, said he’s skeptical solar companies involved in the Esmeralda Seven Solar Project would be eager to resubmit applications after “tariffs and roadblocks set by the administration.”
In July the Trump administration mandated that all solar and wind energy projects on public lands be personally approved by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, a threshold that Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo said has already stalled several solar projects in the state. 
Emmerick, who opposed the Esmeralda Seven Solar Project, said he isn’t surprised the project’s broad environmental review was canceled given the new rules under the Trump administration, and suspects singular approval of each project will be even more cumbersome.
“Solar and wind energy have several new layers of approval for each individual project so this programmatic review for all seven projects makes that kind of individual scrutiny very difficult,” Emmerick said. 
Federal land managers began reviewing the developers’ joint proposals in 2023 under former president Joe Biden. But the project’s environmental review process has been stalled since Donald Trump took office. 
Federal land managers were expected to issue a final environmental impact statement for the project — the last step before a record of decision is issued — at the end of April, but neither materialized. 
The project has attracted strong opposition from locals and conservation groups who caution the size of the project could negatively impact the environment and rural communities’ way of life. 
Several conservation groups have asked federal land managers to move the Esmeralda Seven Solar Project to areas the BLM has earmarked as “solar energy zones” — areas it sees as prime for solar development. Esmeralda County has two solar energy zones, encompassing about 21,000 acres of land. 
Shaaron Netherton, the executive director of Friends of Nevada Wilderness, said she hopes the cancellation of the Esmeralda Seven Solar Project “will be an opportunity moving forward to find better sites for solar development.”
“We need to focus on disturbed  areas and utilize warehouse and data center roofs for solar before using vast stretches of our public lands,” said Netherton, who opposed the joint project. 
“Storey County is being completely developed for industrial buildings. This would be a great place to cover with solar. Producing energy right where it is needed,” she said. 
Locals have also expressed frustration with solar companies’ lack of communication when proposing projects. Esmeralda County commissioner Fred Perez said more than a dozen solar companies have proposed projects in his county. Perez said none of those companies have been in communication with him, including the companies that comprise the Esmeralda Seven Solar Project.
Ben Norris, vice president of regulatory affairs for the Solar Energy Industries Association, said the BLM needs to further clarify “its apparent decision to abruptly cancel these solar projects in the late stages of the review process.”
“We remain deeply concerned that this administration continues to flout the law to the detriment of consumers, the grid, and America’s economic competitiveness,” Norris said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sevensolarblmcover-1024x698.jpeg,,,2025-10-11 00:57:08.108551

He identifies with the Black Robe Regiment, a coalition of pastors committed to tearing down the wall of separation between church and state.
Still, the Rev. Jack Martin insists politics won’t interfere with his volunteer school service.
Living in Hernando County since 1997, he ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 2016 and in 2022. In the 2022 Republican primary, Martin came in second to U.S. Rep. Gus Bilirakis, earning 9.2% of the vote.
Martin remains politically active, particularly through his Facebook and Rumble accounts, posting an array of social media videos supporting Republicans and criticizing Democrats. Among his posts:

An ode to Charlie Kirk.
A video criticizing U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer for the government shutdown, calling him “Uncle Chuckles.”
An image boosting “Pastors for Trump.”
A photo calling for former Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn to be deputized so he can arrest former President Barack Obama.
A video advocating for ivermectin to treat COVID-19, which Martin says saved his life after catching COVID.

“If we want our country back, we can’t stand as spectators applauding Donald Trump.  We need to take our armor, get out there in the battle alongside of Donald Trump,” Martin said during an appearance before the Lake County Florida Republican Assembly.
(Screenshot via Rev. Jack Martin’s Facebook profile)
Martin told the Phoenix that “without apology there are things he [Trump] does I don’t like, too,” and that his support for Trump is “in areas that are restoring our country to be a more sound republic.”
Still, Martin insists his motivation to serve as a chaplain is “not anything political, it’s not to proselytize, it’s to help kids.”
Registered as clergy under the Christian Life Assembly of God church, the Rev. Martin is listed as a chaplain on the Hernando County Schools’ website, meaning he is qualified to “provide support, services, and programs” to students who seek it out.
A 2024 law, HB 931, that permits volunteer chaplains drew backlash from some faith leaders for the possibility it would lead to religious proselytization of students, “undermine the secular nature of public education,” and violate the Establishment Clause, the part of the U.S. Constitution that prohibits government establishment or preference of a religion, the Phoenix has reported.
Faith leaders warn schools of dangers of optional, voluntary chaplain program

The Freedom From Religion Foundation is asking the district to backtrack and not only take away Martin’s permission to serve as a chaplain but to eliminate the entire program, which is voluntary for students.
“Rev. Martin has openly promoted Christian nationalism and disparaged public education itself. His stated views are incompatible with the religious neutrality required of public schools and threaten to undermine the trust and inclusivity essential to serving Hernando County’s diverse student body,” the foundation wrote in its letter to Hernando officials.
The foundation advocated for access for students to “trained professionals such as school counselors, psychologists, and social workers — not clergy advancing religious or political agendas.”
“Please understand that permitting a religious chaplaincy in a public school district jeopardizes the rights of students and parents and invites legal challenge,” the organization’s legal counsel, Christopher Line, concluded in his letter.
Constitutional concerns
The retired Pentecostal pastor told the Phoenix in a phone interview this week he does not share constitutional concerns about the program. He’s “100% sure before the Supreme Court that it would be proven pure and good.”
As chaplain, Martin said, he will try to be “one more layer in a system that’s trying to help our kids get through school and graduate as healthy as they can.”
A father of six homeschooled children, Martin served as chaplain for Spring Hill Fire and Hernando County Fire for 17 years. That experience, he said, has prepared him to work with students.
If a tragedy such as a school shooting were to happen, “I would be the most trained — even out of their counselors — I would be the most trained to be able to go in and immediately start to help,” Martin told the Phoenix.

Citing his outspokenness about Jan. 6, 2021, and his commitment to the Black Robe Regiment, the Freedom From Religion Foundation has called Martin a Christian nationalist.
His response: “I am a Christian who loves the United States of America, the nation that God has allowed me to be born and live in. And I respect the laws of the land. And I respect the word of God. And I attempt, the best I can, to live in a manner that would be the life the way Jesus would have done it.”
Martin does identify as a Black Robe Regiment pastor. The national organization with that name bills itself as a “modern-day network of patriotic pastors and religious leaders striving to safeguard liberty by helping clergy and community leaders step into their God-given duty of leading from the pulpit, in the community, and in government.”
A 2022 Vice report cited by the Freedom From Religion Foundation asserts the Black Robe Regiment does fall within the rubric of Christian nationalism, having ties to Gen. Flynn, who in his Reawakening America tours has argued “the church should be at the heart of all aspects of American society.”
Martin says the Vice story is inaccurate. “I mean the Black Robe Regiment is a term, it’s not one group of people,” he said.
Last month, Martin posted on the Black Robe Regiment Facebook group, of which he’s an administrator, “I say this in humility but mark down that the first Public School Chaplain in the State of Florida is a Black Robe Regiment pastor.”
Martin insists the topics he’s been outspoken about would not be part of his offerings as a chaplain.
“In the past, at school board meetings, I’ve spoken on vaccines, on mandatory masking, and things like that. But those were as a citizen and those were prior to any chaplaincy program existing. But they would not be something that would be talked about,” Martin said.

In an appearance before the Lake County Florida Republican Assembly in August, Martin said he could help combat bullying in schools and calm kids after any bomb or gun scares.
Martin said he was invited to speak to the organization, which declares “everything else will fall into proper place by reforming the Republican Party with Judeo-Christian conservative constitutionalists with the Courage to do what’s right.”
“I hear a lot of pastors say, ‘We’ve fixed the problem, we’ve got Christian schools.’ My only problem with that is, what about all the kids that are still in public school and who are still being forced to believe stuff they shouldn’t?” Martin told the Assembly.
The Rev. Martin has amplified right-wing talking points blaming transgender people for political violence. The day after a shooter opened fire at a Catholic school in Minnesota, Martin told the Lake County Florida Republican Assembly that, “if long before that, somebody had sat down and helped those young people, they would have got the help they need.”
In addressing gender-confirming care, Martin told the Phoenix, “My personal view — and, again, I could not use this one in the school, obviously — but my personal view is that you’re hurting kids. It would be like telling the anorexic if you eat more it will get better, you’re just hurting them. And I think my whole heart in trying to be a chaplain is to help kids, not to hurt them and not to create a bigger problem than already exists.”
(Screenshot via Rev. Jack Martin’s Facebook profile)
Martin has a Rumble channel called “THE HARD RIGHT SAVING AMERICA” and publishes songs he’s written. One title is “The Ballad of J6ers,” a “tribute” to participants in the events that transpired in Washington on Jan. 6, 2021, which he called “no insurrection. It was a 1A protest by citizens.”
“I am a man who loves my country, I was in D.C. that day along with my good buddies believing free speech worked that way,” Martin wrote in his  lyrics, although he stresses he wasn’t there.
There’s an accompanying video featuring clips of  the insurrection and an artificial intelligence-generated image of Obama being handcuffed by FBI agents in the Oval Office as Trump watches.
“And maybe justice will be served and the bad folks are put in jail,” the song continues.
Martin told the Phoenix the Freedom From Religion Foundation’s criticism is incorrect.
“They referred to a song that I had written and I used the quote the president [Trump] used. I want them to go be peaceful protests, and they tried to make it as if I said that was a peaceful protest. I have my own view on that day,” Martin said — going on to allege that more than 270 Deep State “insiders” were among protesters. “I have questions that there was at least some shenanigans with that day.”
Xs and Os
The Hernando County School Board approved language implementing the state’s first public school chaplain the program earlier this year, making it the first district to welcome the volunteer religious figures.
“Pastor Jack, I want to say that I appreciate everything that you have done in leading this chaplain program. I have worked with you hand-in-hand, day-after-day, week-after-week, we’ve had a few months at this, and it’s been some long, hard discussions,” Hernando School Board Chair Shannon Rodriguez said during a school board meeting last month. “I’m honored to come alongside of you.”
The district’s policies outline that chaplains:

May provide religious or spiritual guidance to students, lead students in prayer, and offer reflective, non-judgmental listening to students who are going through a difficult time.
May not seek to persuade or force any student to participate.
May not proselytize for or disparage any religion, belief, lack of belief, or faith group
Provision of care, help or counsel is not proselytization or disparagement.

The district, which operates more than 20 schools, requires chaplains to obtain “an ecclesiastical endorsement from their faith group” to certify they are indeed a leader in the faith, “qualified spiritually, morally, intellectually, and emotionally to serve as a chaplain for the board,” and “sensitive to religious pluralism and able to provide for the free exercise of religion by all students.” 
The policy prescribes that “the selection of a chaplain should reflect the expectations of the local community.”
The program has officially started, although Martin said his counsel has not yet been called upon. 
The policies require interested parents to opt in and provide Martin protections from lawsuits. 
The law requires interested school chaplains to first pass a Level 2 background check, “a state and national fingerprint-based check and consideration of disqualifying offenses and applies to those employees designated by law as holding positions of responsibility or trust.”
After passing the background check, a chaplain wishing to provide services must schedule a consultation with a school principal and interested parents to earn signatures from both parties.
“I would like to look at this three years down the road and see the value of what’s come out of the program, and be able to look back and say, ‘See, this is why I thought it was effective,'” Martin said. 
After the Phoenix’s interview with Martin, a second chaplain was added to the district website, Shawn May, registered with Great Life Church, a non-denominational church in Spring Hill.
State definition of ‘religion’ too narrow, Satanic Temple says

Although groups have raised criticisms and threatened legal action, Martin said he hopes Hernando’s program “can prove to be effective to the good of the school and the students in a way that, if other counties wanted to try it, they would model a program. 
“The school board has done an incredible job of implementing a program that limits what I can do and that’s fine with me,” he added. 
Last year, pastors opposed to chaplains entering schools told the Phoenix they disagreed with its “scout’s honor” system to not proselytize.
Following the passage of the chaplain law, the Satanic Temple told the Florida Gannett newspapers that it intends to take advantage of the law, the Phoenix reported last year. They since have complained that the state’s model policy for districts to carry out the law was too narrow.

A majority of the Douglas County Board, which oversees the county jail as the Board of Corrections, issued a statement Friday objecting to the idea announced Thursday by Sheriff Aaron Hanson.

The statement by Commissioners Chris Rodgers, Jim Cavanaugh, Brian Fahey and Board Chair Roger Garcia offered several reasons for the rationale of the majority on the seven-member elected board.
Garcia previously rebuffed the idea of contracting jail space to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to hold detainees. If put to a vote, that majority would douse the possibility of such a county contract. 
“We will not support any expansion of immigration detention at the Douglas County Jail,” the commissioners’ said in a statement urging instead the state’s federal delegation to work toward comprehensive immigration reform. 
 Financial benefit?

The four said their preferred approach “requires coalition-building and advocacy at the federal level, not contracts that perpetuate harm.” They said that “true humanitarian choice is not to detain mothers, fathers and workers” whom they described as “essential” to the local economy.

While the commissioners said they “fully support” holding violent and drug-trafficking criminals accountable,” they said 72% of ICE detainees nationally have no criminal history. “Detaining hardworking and law-abiding residents who have built lives and families here does not make us safer; it only deepens fear, trauma and economic loss across our communities.”
They also questioned any financial benefit, saying the cost to house an inmate at the county jail is $220 per day, an amount they said exceeds the $175 per diem contract ICE currently pays nearby counties.
Hanson, in response, told the Nebraska Examiner that the county is in an “enviable position” to negotiate a better deal. He said the new revenue stream could be reinvested back into his department’s own trimmed budget, offer tax relief and enhanced public safety measures for county residents and potentially create a national model that could direct money to local immigrant communities.
He’s urged the County Board to put the idea to a public vote.
“This should be on an agenda in which people can come and voice their opinion pro or con, and ultimately elected leaders can do what we are supposed to do, make tough choices,” Hanson said.
A county agreement with ICE for detention, the sheriff said, would allow individuals arrested in the Omaha area to stay close to their families and the area’s “premier healthcare system, legal and support services.” 
He cited the June 10 Omaha Glenn Valley Foods raid in which most of the nearly 80 undocumented workers detained were transported roughly four hours away to a North Platte jail in Lincoln County, which has a contract with ICE.
In an Oct. 7 memo to County Board members, Hanson said the county jail had space and was operating at a “historic low capacity.”
 ‘Deeply troubling’

But according to the director of Douglas County Corrections, Michael Myers, the county jail population has steadily increased since late last year. The total incarcerated population as of today is 1,101, up from 914 in December, Myers said in a statement from a county spokesperson.
Douglas County sheriff urges ICE detention contract for jail, County Board chair balks

Projections, Myers said, show the county on pace to process roughly 1,500 more inmates this year compared to last year, when it booked 15,500 individuals.
Two legal centers that advocated for workers detained in the Omaha Glenn Valley immigration raid weighed in Friday on the ICE-Douglas County proposal, one calling it “deeply troubling.” 
“Immigration detention should never be a business model,” said Roxana Cortes-Mills, legal director of the Center for Immigrant and Refugee Advancement. “The Douglas County sheriff’s proposal to profit from detaining immigrants is deeply troubling, especially at a time when fear and uncertainty are already at an all-time high.”
Said Cortes-Mills, “Let’s be honest, this isn’t about access to health care or staying close to family and legal support. It’s about expanding detention in Nebraska and profiting from an administration intent on dehumanizing immigrants.”
She said CIRA attorneys would continue serving communities across the state “to uphold due process and dignity for all.”
 Promote dialogue

American Civil Liberties Union of Nebraska, which also represents several Glenn Valley detainees, objected to what it called the “illusion” that closer ICE detention facilities would benefit immigrant families.

ACLU executive director Mindy Rush Chipman said that “trying to sprinkle in incentives of money and geographic closeness” is an effort to “hide the ball, so to speak, about what this would actually mean for our communities.”
She said if one asked ACLU’s Omaha clients, they’d likely say it would have been “easier” to have loved one detained closer than North Platte. She, however, doubts those families would support increased ICE detention space in their community.
ACLU believes heavier ICE presence and jail capacity would lead to increased likelihood of “unlawful detentions and liability to the county itself.”
“We all need to push back against the concept this is happening anyway, so we might as well get paid for it,” Rush Chipman said. “This is not good for our communities, no matter if you try to describe and disguise it.”
Hanson sees his proposal as humane for families and a “lucrative opportunity” for the county.
“The biggest thing I’m trying to promote here is dialogue,” he said. “Can we find a way to mitigate the thing that we cannot control — federal detention?”

The State Board of Education was set to vote this week on a controversial measure that many school officials and education advocates say would bar local municipalities from providing much-needed funding and support services to local schools. 
Instead the board voted unanimously on Thursday, at a DEED official’s request, to take no action and return the proposal to the department for further development.

“As a result of the feedback we received, the department will be recommending that the state board take no action on this item, return the proposed regulation to the board or to the department for further collaboration and input with key stakeholders,” said Heather Heineken, the division director for finance and support services for the department, to the board Wednesday, the first day of a two-day meeting. 
The proposal came under sharp criticism and public alarm beginning in June, when DEED introduced the measure as an emergency regulation change. Officials said the move was intended to redefine the amount local municipalities provide for schools — called the local contribution — to include “services provided at no charge to a district by the city or borough.” 
At the time, DEED officials said it was a way to address the balance of funding for schools ↣— in Alaska’s complex school funding formula which includes local, state and federal funding — and avoid failing a federal disparity test. 
The disparity test is required by the U.S. Department of Education to regulate the spread between the highest and lowest funded districts, because of the way the state uses some federal funding, called impact aid. The state failed the test earlier this year, but is in the process of appealing the ruling. 
Education Commissioner Deena Bishop, however, reversed that argument and told board members further discussion was needed with districts and financial offices to clarify what “in-kind” contributions are being made and how they were accounted for. She said that was needed to align with state law and standards for equity between districts. 
“We’re not reacting to the federal government. What we are (doing) is trying to meet the state statute that calls for that equitable funding,” Bishop told the board on Wednesday.
Public raises alarm at unclear change to local contributions
State board members received more than 600 public comments, mostly opposing the measure, in June and July when the regulation was introduced, calling the proposed change vague and potentially limiting vital municipal funding for schools. 
During public comment on Thursday, several district officials expressed opposition and concern.
Valdez School District Superintendent Jason Weber said the change could jeopardize essential city funding, including for transportation and school meals. 
“Our Food Service Program is also at a breaking point. Even after raising lunch prices by $1 per meal last year, we’re still operating at a deficit. Every dollar cut from food service funding is $1 taken away from the plates of kids, these regulations would directly reduce the food we can provide for our students, something no community should have to accept,” he said. 
“Each Alaskan community has unique needs and challenges the decisions about how to support and operate schools should be made by those who live and work closest to them, not through a one size fits all mandate from the state level, undermining local authority threatens the very foundation of community supported education in Alaska,” Weber said.
Juneau School District Superintendent Frank Hauser pointed to the state’s own appeal of the federal disparity test as evidence the change is unnecessary. 
“According to DEED’s July 14 letter, the state would meet the disparity standard, not with a regulation change, which isn’t even mentioned, but by a different accounting method,” Hauser said.
Hauser asked board members to vote the regulation down. 
“I am terrified of version 3.0 of this regulation. Each subsequent attempt at this regulation change has had exponentially more negative impacts, impacts beyond what the department realizes, even to REAAS, home school and correspondence students, instead of enacting the oft quoted definition of insanity, doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results, I ask you today to take a different direction and ask the department to stop with this effort altogether,” he said.
During public comment, district officials also raised concerns at a recent DEED Facebook post, which shared a statement over an image of a burning dumpster fire, calling several Anchorage officials’ out by name, saying that their information was “inaccurate” and saying DEED no longer was pushing the proposal. Commenters called the social media post “unprofessional” and not “positive or proactive communication.”
Anchorage officials had penned an op-ed in the Anchorage Daily News, opposing the regulation change, saying it could “gut” the district and strip $15 million in municipal funding, including for school buses and school resource officers. 
State board members vote to return proposal to DEED
Before the vote, several state board members questioned whether the proposal should come back to the board.
“I guess I’m questioning now, is it really an issue, or is that needs to be addressed, or does it just need to go away?” asked board member Pamela Dupras on Thursday. 
Bishop responded that DEED will gather more feedback, and work with districts to adhere to state law and requirements for equitability. She also pointed to the new Legislative Task Force on Education Funding that may take up the issue and recommend new legislation to define local contributions.
Bishop said DEED would work with district officials and finance departments to further clarify the requirements. “I’m glad that you’re pulling this back,” she said. 
She also acknowledged the frustration of districts. “Every two weeks from August until now, I’ve been sharing the same message that, yes, we do not want to put this forward. So I understand the frustration with what was in writing, certainly superintendents that attended all those meetings knew the intent,” she said. 
“I think just the stress about school funding, a lot of trust isn’t there,” Bishop added. “The Department wants to earn that trust back and continue with the work.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6721-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-10 21:57:24.367336

Mike Dunleavy’s re-election campaign in 2022 must comply with a subpoena issued as part of a yearslong investigation, the Alaska Supreme Court ruled Friday.
In a 13-page decision, the court rejected a series of arguments offered by attorneys representing the Republican Governors Association, and it ordered the organization to comply with the subpoena.
The decision was authored by Justice Dario Borghesan, a Dunleavy appointee.
Attorneys representing the RGA did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.
Since 2022, the Alaska Public Offices Commission has been seeking documents from the RGA — a national group that backs Republican candidates for governor — to determine whether or not the group illegally colluded with Dunleavy’s 2022 campaign.
The RGA is considered an “independent expenditure” group and thus is barred by law from coordinating with a political candidate’s campaign. In 2022, two progressive groups filed complaints against the RGA. 
The state watchdog agency APOC, which regulates political campaign spending, began an investigation, but the RGA refused to comply with a subpoena seeking banking information and relevant communications.
Anchorage-based attorney Scott Kendall, who represents the political groups that filed complaints against the RGA three years ago, said that if RGA now complies with the subpoenas, APOC can actually judge the original complaints on their merits.
That could have implications for next year’s governor election, Kendall said on Friday.
“Are they going to participate (in the 2026 election)? If they’re going to participate, are they going to disclose their donors if they participate?” he asked. “What will the public think of them if, in fact, APOC does find that they broke the law? I have to believe the RGA has the intention of trying to participate in this upcoming election, and whether they broke the law last time, and whether they intend to follow the law this time, I think, are very, very relevant issues.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/GettyImages-1280273369-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-10 21:57:24.367336

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)As Alaska lawmakers contemplate the need to spend from savings to balance next year’s state budget, a unique investment by the state’s departing revenue commissioner is drawing their attention.
Shortly before leaving office in July to run for governor as a Republican candidate, former commissioner Adam Crum approved a $50 million private equity investment with the firm DigitalBridge, using money from the state’s principal savings account.
That account, the Constitutional Budget Reserve, has about $2.9 billion and until now has been invested in ways that can be easily convertible to cash in case the state needs to spend it on short notice. 
Private equity investments, which typically involve taking a share of a company that isn’t yet listed on a stock market, frequently take years to mature. This is the first time the CBR has been invested in private equity.
The DigitalBridge investment can’t be canceled, said a spokesperson for the Alaska Department of Revenue.
Though the investment involves less than 2% of the budget reserve’s funds, state legislators expect to spend — at the least — hundreds of millions of dollars from the reserve next year in order to pay for services and the Permanent Fund dividend.
Senate President Gary Stevens, R-Kodiak, and Speaker of the House Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham, said in a written statement on Oct. 3 that they “were caught off guard” when they learned about the move.
They said putting “tens of millions of dollars into an illiquid, high-risk investment” undermines the purpose of the budget reserve, which is to provide stability. 
“Future high risk investments of this nature should not occur without the involvement of the Legislature,” they said. 
Crum’s successor as revenue commissioner, Janelle Earls, was also concerned about the process used for making the investment, said Aimee Bushnell, a spokesperson for the Department of Revenue. 
“After being advised of the acting commissioner’s concerns, the governor apprised legislative leadership of the transaction, forwarded documents to the legislative auditor for review, and directed an outside third-party review be conducted to determine whether there were in fact any violations of policy and make process recommendations as appropriate,” she said.
Crum, speaking by phone on Thursday, said he was surprised by the reaction, in part because he had been working on the investment for more than a year.
In 2000, lawmakers and then-Gov. Tony Knowles created a subaccount within the budget reserve to allow higher-risk, higher-yield investments. That subaccount was drained in 2015, at a time of plunging oil revenue.
The budget reserve’s money moved to low-risk investments, but that comes at a downside; those investments barely keep up with inflation.
“It actually means you’re deteriorating the buying power of the CBR over time,” he said. “And so that actually is a harmful thing.”
Crum said he asked the Department of Law and then-Attorney General Treg Taylor whether he could pursue alternative investments via the disused subaccount.
The answer was yes, and Crum signed a revision to the CBR subaccount investment policy on July 29. He left office on Aug. 8, and the DigitalBridge investment closed three days later.
The money isn’t going to in-state projects, and Crum said he has no personal ties to DigitalBridge.
“In fact, both myself and DigitalBridge would be in incredible trouble if there were any financial ties,” he said.
Crum said that as revenue commissioner, he had a fiduciary duty to make sure the state’s investments were working as best as they could.
“If we can actually make greater returns, we actually can just make sure that we’re building up the fund over time,” Crum said.
Senate President Stevens, by phone on Thursday, said he understands that the investment is a small part of the CBR, but “we’re concerned that we don’t know what’s going to happen in the economy. We don’t know if oil is going to go to zero. It has in the past, and we’re concerned about having the money we need to run government.”
In May, members of the Senate said at a news conference they were worried about a gap between revenue and expenses in 2026 and said that gap could be as large as $600 million.
An unexpected drop in oil prices or production could widen that gap.
Crum said he believes that if the Legislature needs the last $50 million in the CBR, the state will have much bigger issues by that point.
“The $50 million is such a low dollar amount that I do find it amusing that legislators are clutching their pearls about it, because if we somehow burned through $3 billion in savings and we’re down to our last $50 million, we’re dead in the water,” he said. “That is the equivalent of rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic. That is not the $50 million that is going to save the state.”
Rep. Andy Josephson, D-Anchorage and operating budget chair for the House Finance Committee this past year, said he doesn’t think the Legislature will need all of the CBR, but added, “I think there’s a greater concern about the fact that we need readily available cash, and that’s what the CBR was designed to provide. And you know, these high-risk investments may not be conducive with that goal.”
He noted that lawmakers have repeatedly clashed with the executive branch in recent years, including on the topic of financial disclosure. In August, legislators overrode Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s veto of a bill intended to compel the Department of Revenue to release information related to oil tax audits. The department had declined for years to release that information to legislators.
“It’s just — we’re suspicious,” Josephson said. “We don’t know when we can have our $50 million back.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/230120-Crum-copy-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-10 21:57:24.367336

(Photo by Ryan Hagerty/USFWS)Alaska judges will not hear a lawsuit alleging that the Alaska Department of Fish and Game has mishandled the state’s valuable salmon returns.
On Friday, the Alaska Supreme Court upheld a lower-court decision that dismissed a case brought by Juneau resident Eric Forrer in 2022.
Forrer had argued that years of declining salmon returns in the Yukon and Kuskokwim Rivers clearly showed that the department was violating a section of the Alaska Constitution that requires fish be managed for sustained yield. 
Forrer, a long-time Alaska resident, has a history of personal-use and commercial fishing, including on the Yukon River. 
In his suit, he sought a declaration confirming that the Fish and Game was violating the constitution and sought an injunction directing the department “to fulfill the sustained yield mandate.”
Bethel Superior Court Judge Nathaniel Peters dismissed the case in 2023, but Forrer appealed to the Alaska Supreme Court.
In an 18-page order published Friday, the five-member court said unanimously that because Forrer didn’t challenge a specific policy, law or regulation, Peters was correct and the case should be dismissed.
If the court had allowed the suit, wrote Justice Dario Borghesan, it would have amounted to “judicial management of the fisheries at issue” and “would be contrary to constitutional design and practically untenable.”
Borghesan wrote that if the court were to eventually issue an injunction, Fish and Game would almost be required to guess what solution would be acceptable to the court.
Forrer was represented by attorney Joe Geldhof, who frequently participates in public-interest lawsuits in front of the Alaska Supreme Court.
By phone, Geldhof said he was disappointed by the decision and begs the question of what Alaskans are supposed to do when a state agency isn’t fulfilling its mandate.
“Where do you go when there’s a systemic failure?” he asked.
Friday’s Supreme Court order implies that if that’s the case, elected officials need to fix the issue.
The Yukon and Kuskokwim rivers have seen severe declines in salmon returns despite restrictions on fishing that are intended to increase the number of fish that return to local rivers to breed.
“The separation of powers doctrine prohibits Alaska courts from reviewing nonjusticiable political questions,” Borghesan wrote on behalf of the court. “A claim is not justiciable if ‘deciding the claim would require us to answer questions that are better directed to the legislative or executive branches of government.’”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/e6332b94-ab76-4b9a-a536-98a0e73dbbfe_1336x1110.png,,,2025-10-10 20:58:19.875421

(iStock/Getty Images Plus)When 11 babies were exposed to measles in Cache County last month, public health workers rushed to get in touch with their families and helped provide emergency medication to keep the infants from getting sick. 
“I was just really proud of the work that the local health department did, and the local health care facilities,” said Amelia Salmanson, an epidemiologist with the Utah Department of Health and Human Services, or DHHS. “I went to bed knowing that we were going to be providing this support to these vulnerable babies.”
Salmanson’s still not resting easy, though. She and her colleagues are anticipating a rise in cases of the highly contagious disease, in Utah and beyond. They’re especially focused on other infants too young to be vaccinated but who may come in contact with the virus in day cares or other settings. 
“I get very nervous,” Salmanson said. 
Measles reaches highest level in 33 years, now in 39 states

Utah has recorded 55 cases of measles this year, with the majority – 41– in the southwestern corner of the state. 
That outbreak along the Utah-Arizona border is prompting local health officials to recommend early MMR vaccination (protecting against measles, mumps and rubella) for babies living in or traveling to Washington County. 
The standard MMR vaccine schedule starts at 12 months old, Salmanson said, but babies are eligible at six months. 
DHHS isn’t recommending early vaccination for kids in other counties, but said it will do so later on if it determines a county’s transmission levels put babies at risk. 
Any children who do get an early dose will still need the two standard doses later on, at 12 to 15 months and then at 4 to 6 years, according to the health department. 
Outside of the southwest corner of the state, Utah recorded four cases in its northern Bear River district and three in its southeast district, along with seven in Utah County. 
Utah County doesn’t have any current cases, said spokesperson Aislynn Tolman-Hill. Still, measles has continued to show up in its wastewater, appearing in its most recent sample from Sept. 30.

While no infants were diagnosed in the county’s outbreak, its health department is preparing for the possibility they’ll be exposed. 
“That’s something that, yes, we definitely are concerned about, with how young of a population we have,” Tolman-Hill said, noting Utah County is one of the youngest in the nation. “Along with that, we are concerned about all of the pregnant moms we have out there in our community.” 
Salmanson agreed. 
“In terms of severe illness and risk for complications, young babies and pregnant women are definitely at the top,” she said. 
There’s some indication those with immunity to measles can transfer antibodies to their babies before birth, Salmanson added, but women aren’t eligible to get the vaccine while pregnant. She recommends that those seeking more information visit the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine’s website.

,California,2025-10-10 23:55:32+00:00,CalMatters,Judge shuts down California tribes’ latest bid to crush their casino rivals,Ryan Sabalow,,,,,https://calmatters.org/digital-democracy/2025/10/california-gambling-casinos-cardrooms/,California card rooms emerged victorious in the latest battle over whether tribes should have exclusive rights to offer Las Vegas-style gambling.,"In summary
California card rooms emerged victorious in the latest battle over whether tribes should have exclusive rights to offer Las Vegas-style gambling.


Over the years, casino-owning tribes have spent millions in court, in the Legislature and at the ballot box trying unsuccessfully to force their only competitors out of California’s casino business. 
A judge today blocked their latest effort.
Last year, tribes persuaded the California Legislature and Gov. Gavin Newsom to allow them to sue gambling halls called card rooms over the tribes’ claim that they have exclusive rights to offer Las Vegas-style gambling in the state.
Since the tribes are sovereign governments, they had lacked standing to sue the private businesses until Newsom signed Senate Bill 549, which gave the tribes one shot this year to resolve their dispute in Sacramento County Superior Court.
Superior Court Judge Lauri Damrell today dismissed the tribes’ case, saying federal gambling law superseded the measure Newsom signed.  
“The court is mindful that previous efforts to resolve this longstanding dispute – whether through regulatory action, legislation, ballot initiatives, or litigation – have been unavailing,” Damrell wrote in a tentative ruling that she approved during a hearing. The court “recognizes the genuine desire, shared by many stakeholders, including the California Legislature, to reach the merits and achieve a final resolution. The court does not take lightly the importance of the issues at stake and, were it within its authority to provide a definitive resolution, it would endeavor to do so.” 
Still, Damrell wrote she was “bound by the limits of federal law.”
California’s card room industry applauded the ruling. 
“We are encouraged by today’s decision,” California Gaming Association President Kyle Kirkland said in a written statement. “Our member cardrooms will continue to support good jobs, vital public services, and local economies across California while upholding the highest standards of integrity, accountability, and compliance.”
Tribes say they strongly disagree with the court’s decision and plan on appealing it.
“This outcome is especially troubling given that it was a state law enacted just last year that explicitly gave tribes standing in state court,” James Siva, chairperson of the California Nations Indian Gaming Association, said in a written statement. “It’s difficult to reconcile this ruling with the clear intent of the Legislature, and once again, a court has sidestepped the actual merits of the case — effectively denying tribes a fair opportunity to seek justice.”
Tribal revenues vs. city taxes
The tribes sued on Jan. 2, the first day the courts were open and the day after SB 549 took effect.
The tribes’ suit alleged that the dozens of gambling halls scattered across California were illegally offering card games such as black jack and pai gow poker that cut into the tribes’ gambling revenues.
“Defendants brazenly profit from illegal gambling,” the tribes said in the opening line of their lawsuit.
Tribes say California voters years ago gave them the exclusive rights to host table games, which they use as a critically important source of revenue to support their historically disenfranchised communities.
Under the bill, tribes cannot receive any money or attorneys’ fees from the lawsuit. Instead, they  could only petition the court to decide whether card rooms can continue to offer the disputed games.
The stakes are high outside of casinos since some cities receive nearly half of their budgets from taxes on card rooms, meaning a tribal victory in court would have jeopardized money for police, firefighters and other local services.
San Jose City Councilmember Sergio Jimenez told lawmakers last year that the city receives $30 million each year from card rooms, enough to fund 150 police officers or 133 firefighters. Jimenez said that money’s in jeopardy if the tribes prevail in court.
The card room industry claims the games are legal and that the attorney general’s office has approved each of them over the years. 
The tribes have tried to sue card rooms for unfair business practices before. But California’s courts have ruled that the tribes don’t have standing.
“There is little doubt that commercial cardrooms are flouting the law by offering illegal games and operating outside the bounds of state regulations,” Siva said in today’s statement. “All we have ever sought is a clear judicial determination on whether these practices are lawful under state law. That is not an unreasonable ask — and tribes should not be denied
their day in court.”
An expensive political fight
The fight over SB 549 was one of the most costly political battles of the two-year legislative session that concluded last year.
A bipartisan coalition of lawmakers, many of them with large tribal casinos in their districts, pushed for the gambling measure, while a smaller group of lawmakers with card rooms in their districts opposed it.
It followed a failed 2022 sports betting initiative that the tribes spent millions of dollars to sponsor and that included a similar provision that would have let the tribes sue.
The opposing gambling interests donated at least $4.3 million to the 120 members of the Legislature since January 2023, according to the Digital Democracy database.
Facing what they saw as an existential threat, card rooms responded to SB 549’s introduction with a massive lobbying blitz. In 2023, Hawaiian Gardens Casino alone spent $9.1 million on lobbying, the second highest amount reported to state regulators. Only the international oil giant, Chevron Corp., spent more.
Then, despite Newsom signing the law, the card room industry spent more than $3 million in the lead up to the November election in retaliation against four lawmakers who played key roles in the bill’s passage.
Three of the candidates targeted by the card rooms ended up losing, including the bill’s author, Democratic Sen. Josh Newman of Fullerton.
Meanwhile, the tribes’ efforts to push out other gambling competitors from California continued in the Legislature this year. 
The Legislature approved Assembly Bill 831 in September. The measure bans online gaming companies from offering digital sweepstakes that the tribes see as another threat to their exclusive rights to gambling.
Newsom hasn’t yet signed the measure into law. He hasn’t indicated whether he will. He has until Monday to make a decision.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/031423_SoCal-Cardrooms_TS_CM_45.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-10 19:59:15.411774

Authorities initially arrested Gunnar McLean Schubert, 29, on suspicion of first-degree burglary, first-degree arson, and first-degree malicious mischief. But prosecutors on Wednesday charged him with only second-degree burglary, a felony, and third-degree malicious mischief, a gross misdemeanor.  
To be convicted of both charges, the prosecution would need to prove that Schubert entered or remained unlawfully in a building with the intent to commit a crime inside, and that he damaged less than $750-worth of property. 
Schubert’s arraignment was scheduled for Friday afternoon, but was delayed a week to allow him to complete his mental health evaluation as previously ordered by the court. His hearing is now scheduled for 1:30 p.m. on Oct. 17. 
The evaluation will determine whether Schubert is mentally capable of proceeding with his case. If he is found incompetent, he will be admitted to an involuntary treatment facility. 
In a rampage late Sunday night that lasted roughly 10 minutes, according to authorities, Schubert allegedly parked his car on the sidewalk of the campus flag circle, broke into the Capitol through a window, set fire to county, state and U.S. flags and damaged what the state calls the “world’s largest single-loom carpet” that is almost a century old in the state reception room. 
He is also accused of knocking over busts of George Washington and Martin Luther King Jr. and damaging an electronic card reader for an elevator. The card reader has since been fixed, according to the Department of Enterprise Services.
He sustained a cut on his left arm during the incident and was treated by Olympia Fire Department personnel on the scene. His right arm was in a cast at the time. 
Schubert was released from jail on Tuesday, Oct. 7, without needing to post bail. A judge found that bail was not necessary to secure his reappearance at court, but determined that several conditions of release were necessary. 
Undergoing a mental health evaluation was one of those conditions. Another prohibits him from visiting the Capitol campus without an official escort. 
He was also required to contact the court’s pretrial services department within two days of his release, but failed to do so, according to court documents. A violation report has been added to his record, but has not yet been addressed by a judge. 
An attorney representing Schubert confirmed Friday that he is in custody at an undisclosed location while he undergoes his mental health evaluation. 
Schubert’s possible motivation remains unclear. Some officials attributed his alleged actions to mental health issues. 
In videos posted to social media in the days leading up to the break-in, Schubert rambled through sometimes nonsensical rants. In separate posts, he posed with a gun, invoked a Democratic state lawmaker and wrote current events-themed poems as captions. 
Two weeks before allegedly vandalizing the Capitol, Schubert posted a photo inside the Capitol rotunda with one of those poetic captions. 
Schubert played baseball at Gonzaga University and is a former minor league player. 
The incident has stoked concerns of politically motivated violence locally, after the killings this year of Minnesota state House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, as well as Republican commentator Charlie Kirk. 
“I take his family at their word that there are mental health considerations,” Lt. Gov. Denny Heck,  a Democrat, said Monday. But, Heck added, “How is it not a political statement to enter the state Capitol building and do damage? He could have entered any of a thousand buildings in Thurston County.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/George-Washington-bust-tipped-1-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-10-10 19:59:15.411774
,DC,2025-10-10 22:59:17+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Judge weighs Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s release from immigration detention,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/judge-weighs-kilmar-abrego-garcias-release-immigration-detention,,"GREENBELT, Md. — A federal judge in Maryland seemed inclined to order the release of  Kilmar Abrego Garcia from immigration detention after oral arguments in court Friday, a potentially major development in the high-profile case.After a more than six-hour hearing, District Judge Paula Xinis said a witness provided by the Justice Department showed little evidence that the Trump administration made an effort to remove Abrego Garcia to the southern African nation of Eswatini, and knew nothing about Abrego Garcia agreeing to be removed to Costa Rica. The witness tapped by the Department of Justice was John Schultz, a deputy assistant director who oversees Immigration and Customs Enforcement removal operations.After hearing from him, Xinis said keeping Abrego Garcia detained indefinitely would likely be unconstitutional. She said she would issue an order soon.Abrego Garcia, the Salvadoran immigrant whose wrongful deportation from Maryland put a spotlight on the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration crackdown, is currently detained in Pennsylvania. His attorneys have argued the Trump administration is using detention to punish Abrego Garcia because officials are not trying to remove him, even after Abrego Garcia agreed to be deported to Costa Rica.‘Three strikes, you’re out’Xinis expressed her frustration with Department of Justice attorneys for not providing a witness who would give clear answers on how immigration officials were handling the removal of Abrego Garcia. “We're getting to the three strikes, you’re out,” Xinis said. Andrew J. Rossman, an attorney for Abrego Garcia, argued that if Immigration and Customs Enforcement is making no plans to immediately remove him, he should be released from detention. He also argued that since March, when the Trump administration erroneously deported Abrego Garcia to a mega-prison in El Salvador, to the present, Abrego Garcia has been “in continuous containment” way past the six-month limit set by the Supreme Court regarding the detention of immigrants.“The real aim of the government… is punitive, which is just to keep him incarcerated,” Rossman said. ""It's an overtly political purpose.”

Rossman told Xinis that he has not received an answer from the federal government as to why they will not remove Abrego Garcia to Costa Rica, after he agreed to that proposal in August.Xinis asked DOJ attorney Drew Ensign why Abrego Garcia hasn’t been removed to Costa Rica.Ensign said that it was not clear to the government until Friday that Abrego Garcia had agreed to be removed to Costa Rica, because Abrego Garcia had previously expressed fear of being sent there. Abrego Garcia changed his position after Costa Rica assured him he would be given refugee status.“That is a new development that I will report back to people,” Ensign said.Supreme Court rulingA 2001 Supreme Court ruling does not allow for immigrants to be detained longer than six months if the federal government is making no efforts to remove them. After 90 days without efforts to deport an immigrant, a challenge can be made because detaining that person any longer than a maximum of 180 days, or six months, would likely be unconstitutional, the high court found in Zadvydas v. Davis. Earlier this week, Xinis seemed likely to order Abrego Garcia’s release from Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention, where he has remained since late August. Xinis, who also ordered the Trump administration to return Abrego Garica to the United States after she found his removal to El Salvador unlawful, is overseeing his habeas corpus petition, which challenges his detention.Protesters rally outside the courthouseAhead of the hearing, dozens of supporters from the immigrant advocacy group CASA gathered in front of the District Court for the District of Maryland, chanting, “Somos todos Kilmar,” or, “We are all Kilmar.” Rallygoers also chanted “What do we want? Justice!” “When do we want it? Now!” Some also held signs urging the Trump administration to free Abrego Garcia.

Two Maryland state legislators, Dels. Nicole Williams and Bernice Mireku-North, both Democrats, joined the rally.Williams sponsored legislation during this year’s General Assembly session to prohibit local police from entering into certain agreements with ICE. On the last day of the legislative session in April, lawmakers passed a watered-down version of a bill that does not include the ban, the biggest loss for Maryland immigration advocates this year.“We are going to be working on legislation with regards to masking by law enforcement officers,” Williams said. “We need to start treating everyone, I don’t care where you’re from, in a humane and decent way. And that’s what we’re going to be fighting for every single day until Kilmar is free and Kilmar comes home. So stop using Kilmar for your own political gain. Bring Kilmar home.”White House involvementSchultz, the DOJ witness, revealed that the White House had direct involvement in picking Uganda as a potential third country of removal for ICE’s deportation of Abrego Garcia. The move was unusual because the State Department typically coordinates third-country removals for the Department of Homeland Security.Schultz said the Homeland Security Council, which operates within the White House, notified ICE of Uganda as a third country of removal. The Homeland Security Council works with the National Security Council of the White House. While Uganda is no longer a third country of removal for Abrego Garcia, ICE is trying to now remove him to Eswatini. Schultz said Eswatini has not agreed to take Abrego Garcia, but discussions, which he said started on Wednesday, are underway. “The discussions are continuing,” Schultz said. Schultz said he is not aware if ICE has not made any efforts to determine if Abrego Garcia would face persecution or be tortured or confined in Eswatini, or be removed a second time to El Salvador.  Eswatini has previously agreed to accept third-country removals from the U.S. and the two countries have a memorandum of understanding, he added.Ghana another potential destinationSchultz said that ICE has also identified the west African country of Ghana as a potential nation for Abrego Garica’s removal. Schultz said once a third country has agreed to accept Abrego Garica, he could be removed by ICE within 72 hours.However, Ghana’s Foreign Minister, Sam Okudzeto Ablakwa, wrote on social media that the country will not accept Abrego Garcia. “This has been directly and unambiguously conveyed to US authorities,” he wrote. “In my interactions with US officials, I made clear that our understanding to accept a limited number of non-criminal West Africans, purely on the grounds of African solidarity and humanitarian principles would not be expanded.”Schultz said that ICE ""prematurely"" sent a notice of removal to Abrego Garcia with Ghana as the designation.The Costa Rica alternativeOne of Abrego Garcia’s attorneys, Sascha Rand, grilled Schultz about why DHS would not remove him to Costa Rica, despite Abrego Garcia agreeing to go.Schultz said he was unaware of the letter from Costa Rica’s government saying it would accept Abrego Garcia.Another attorney for Abrego Garcia, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, said that the Trump administration offered to remove Abrego Garcia to Costa Rica in August if he were to plead guilty to criminal charges in a federal case in Tennessee. Abrego Garcia’s attorneys in his criminal case in Nashville said in court filings that the Trump administration is trying to get him to plead guilty to human smuggling charges by promising to remove him to Costa Rica if he does so, and threatening to deport him to Uganda if he refuses. Rand asked Schultz if anyone from DHS was in contact with Costa Rica.Schultz said he was unaware if there were conversations between the federal government and Costa Rica about removing him there. Rossman said based on Schultz’s testimony, it was clear the Trump administration was “holding hostage passage to Costa Rica.”“They aren’t presently intending to remove him,” he said. “They have spun the globe and picked various (African) countries… to fail on purpose.”William J.
